The Supreme Court has observed that once the witness is in the witness box and is being cross examined, every endeavour must be made to ensure that the cross examination is completed on that day.
 The bench of Justices SK Kaul and MM Sundresh rendered this observation while considering a SLP assailing Allahabad High Court's order dated March 19, 2021 ("impugned order").
 In the impugned order, the High Court had refused to grant bail to the applicant against whom an FIR was registered under Sections 419, 420, 467, 468, 471, 406 506, 392, 120-B IPC.
 Appearing for the petitioner, counsel submitted that whenever the first witness was under cross examination and after a couple of questions the matter was deferred. He also apprised the Court that there were 4 private witnesses in the case.
 Expressing its disapproval with regards to the deference of matter, the bench in their order said,
 "Once the witness is in the witness box and is being cross examined every endeavour must be made to ensure that the cross examination is completed on that day. This is more so looking into the nature of the case before the Court which is not a complex criminal trial.We expect the trial Court to complete the examination of the private witnesses before the next date."
