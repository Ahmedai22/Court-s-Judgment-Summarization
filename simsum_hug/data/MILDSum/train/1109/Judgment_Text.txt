Under extraordinary circumstances this bench
had to be reconstituted before the returnable date of the
The situation is this. It is alleged by a section of
parents/students mostly of G.D. Birla Centre for
International School and some other schools that very
arbitrarily the school authorities are not granting
promotion to students, withholding their report cards
and not allowing them to join the higher class in the
new session on the pretext that school fees have not
been paid. The schools are charging a much larger
amount than that directed to be charged by our interim
We have heard Mr. Sabyasachi Chowdhury and
Mr. Aniruddha Mitra for Ashoka Hall Group of Schools
and Adamas International School respectively. Both
learned counsel denied the allegations.
In fact they submitted that fee was sought to be
paid by a significant number of guardians/students in
a most haphazard manner, much lower than the fees
required to be paid as per our order. This payment was
sought to be justified by them by saying that it was in
terms of our order.
This is the dispute between the school authorities
and the guardians/students.
After hearing learned counsel for the parties and
some parents and students in person, we pass the
following order:
(a) None of the 145 schools/teaching institutions
shall deny promotion to any student to the
next session or withhold their report card till
further orders.
(b) All students shall be allowed to join the higher
class in the new session and shall be provided
the normal educational facilities.
(c) The arrangement under which the students
shall pay fees and other charges to the
schools/educational institutions for the new
session    shall  be    entirely   between   the
schools/teaching      institutions    and    the
students/guardians and shall not be affected
by this order or any previous order.
(d) As far as the payment of school fees during
the   operation   of   our   interim   order   is
concerned,    the  payment      made   by   each
students/ guardians shall be accompanied by
a statement showing the calculation for such
payment.
(e) As a matter of guidance to the parents/
students the fee last paid and accepted by the
schools/teaching     institutions    should   be
indicative of how much is payable for a
particular month preceding the start of the
new session.
(f) The learned Registrar General of this court is
to immediately forward our order dated 25th
March, 2022 to the Joint Special Officers.
(g) So that the schools/teaching institutions do
not suffer any deficiency in fund, we direct the
Joint Special Officers to go into the above
dispute regarding fee liability and to come to a
decision in the matter.
(h) The Joint Special Officers will also look into
the complaint of arbitrary increase in school
fees during the Covid-19 pandemic period
with a view to circumvent the order of this
court and take a decision in the matter with
regard to fee actually payable by those
guardians/ students.
(i) Each of the guardians/students shall make
payment of the fee determined as payable by
the Joint Special Officers to the schools/
teaching institutions within two weeks of such
determination without prejudice to his rights
and contentions in these applications.
(j) The Joint Special Officers shall also tabulate
in their report the names of the students who
have not made any payment at all during the
operation of our interim orders.
This order is to be treated as a further interim
order in the writ applications which as per our earlier
direction shall appear in the list on 10th June, 2022.
