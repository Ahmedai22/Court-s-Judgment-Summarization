(Judgment of the Court was made by R.SUBRAMANIAN, J.)
Challenge in this appeal is to the order of interim maintenance at
Rs.20,000/- per month awarded by the IV-Additional Principal Judge /
Family Court, Chennai in favour of the husband.
2.The original petition in O.P.No.2132 of 2017 was filed by the
wife seeking a declaration as to the nullity of the marriage that took place
between her and the respondent herein on 24.04.2002 on the ground that the
earlier marriage between the respondent and one A.Janaki was subsisting.
Pending the said application, the husband filed another original petition in
O.P.No.2132 of 2017 seeking divorce on the ground of cruelty. Pending the
said original petition, the husband filed M.P.No.123 of 2018 seeking
maintenance primarily contending that he has been thrown out of the house
which he was occupying and he was unable to do the business, which he
was carrying on because of his health condition. Health condition that was
projected is that he had a heart ailment and he had to undergo angioplasty
and have a stent implanted.
3.This petition was resisted by the wife contending that at the time
of marriage, the husband did not have a permanent job, she had pledged
jewels and had the finance business started, which ended in loss.
Thereafter, by obtaining a loan from Indian Bank, a house was purchased
and the wife has been doing business in real estate and has been running a
family while the husband, who is a habitual drinker, would drink and
indulge in quarrels.
4.It is also claimed that the husband is doing a finance business
and real estate business and earning more than a lakhs of rupees and having
a very luxurious life. The learned Family Judge took note of the fact that
the husband has undergone angioplasty and has got a stent fixed, took pity
on him and as a result of such misplaced sympathy, granted Rs.20,000/- per
month as interim maintenance. Aggrieved, the wife is on appeal.
5.We have heard Mr.R.Rajarajan, learned counsel appearing for
the appellant and Mr.K.Shakespeare, learned counsel appearing for the
respondent.
6.Mr.R.Rajarajan, learned counsel appearing for the appellant
would vehemently contend that if a husband is to claim maintenance from
the wife, he must prove that he is unable to eke out his livelihood by doing
any work. In the absence of such proof, there cannot be a direction for
payment of maintenance by the wife to the husband. The only reason that is
projected by the husband for his inability to work and earn is that he had
undergone an angioplasty.       Angioplasty as commonly understood, is a
fixation of a stent for widening the blood vessels. It does not incapacitate a
person.     The husband can always do his business and work for his
livelihood, despite such procedure having been done. It is not a major heart
surgery, which would cripple a person.
7.The learned judge magnified a small procedure as if the husband
is totally incapacitated and proceeded to grant maintenance. Even though it
is a civil appeal where we could not look into the material, which is not
placed before the Trial court, the wife has produced the income tax
assessment of the husband for the years 2017-2018, 2018-2019, 2019-2020,
2020-2021. Since the matter involves the payment of maintenance and the
wife did not have legal assistance before the Family Court we had looked
into the returns and we find the husband has returned an income of about
Rs.8,00,000/- during the assessment year 2017-2018, Rs.4,21,840/- for the
assessment year 2019-2020, Rs.6,10,214/- for the assessment year 2020-
2021 and Rs.6,27,417/- for the assessment year 2021-2022.
8.In the light of the such evidence that has been placed before us,
we do not think, we could sustain the order of the Family Court. This Civil
Miscellaneous Appeal is therefore allowed, the order granting interim
maintenance is set aside. No costs. Consequently, connected miscellaneous
petition is closed.
