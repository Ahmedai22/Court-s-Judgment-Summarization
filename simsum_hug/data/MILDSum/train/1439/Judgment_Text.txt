The petitioner is before this Court calling in question
registration of crime in Crime No.163 of 2022 registered on
29.07.2022 for offences punishable under Sections 417, 420, 196,
199, 201 and 205 of the IPC.
2. The facts that have driven the petitioner to this Court
calling in question the registration of crime, as borne out from the
pleadings, in brief, are as follows:-
The petitioner, a practicing Advocate put in a service in the
profession for 27 years has been representing the 2nd respondent
/Rajiv Gandhi University of Health Sciences, Karnataka (‘the
University’ for short), the complainant herein for over 15 years. The
petition narrates that there has been no blemish whatsoever
against the petitioner in his appearances for the University before
this Court. Criminal Petition Nos. 101638 of 2021, 100998 of 2022,
101172 of 2022, 101186 of 2022, 101228 of 2022, 101258 of
2022, 101368 of 2022, 101369 of 2022, 101370 of 2022, 101374
of 2022 and 101384 of 2022 were either filed or pending before the
Dharwad Bench of this Court seeking quashment of proceedings in
Spl.C.No.126 of 2012 registered against several accused alleging
their involvement of malpractice in the conduct of Post Graduate
Entrance Test (‘PGET-2010). Those accused against whom criminal
cases were registered were also proceeded departmentally. In the
departmental enquiry, it appears, that those accused were all
exonerated after a full blown enquiry. The issue in the enquiry is
what concerns this Court in the case at hand. Based upon the said
exoneration in the enquiry, the afore-quoted criminal petitions were
filed before the Dharwad Bench of this Court. A Co-ordinate Bench
of   this Court allowed those petitions      and   quashed   criminal
proceedings that were pending, relying upon a judgment rendered
by a Co-ordinate Bench of this Court in Writ Petition No.19700 of
2018 decided on 27.07.2021.       In those cases, the accused were
different. The State of Karnataka was represented by the learned
High Court Government Pleader.        The 2nd respondent who was
arrayed as Vice-Chancellor of Rajiv Gandhi University of Health
Sciences, Karnataka had either been represented or the Court
directed the petitioner herein to accept notice for the University. It
is averred in the petition that owing to the fact that the petitioner
was representing the University in the cases before this Court for
long, the said direction was issued and accepted by the petitioner.
Orders were passed on 7th, 18th, 20th and 21st April, 2022 allowing
those petitions following the judgment rendered by a Co-ordinate
Bench in Writ Petition No.19700 of 2018.
3. The issue   in the writ petition (supra) was whether the
criminal trial should be permitted to continue where the guilt will
have to be proved beyond all reasonable doubt in the teeth of
accused therein getting exonerated in a departmental enquiry
where probabilities are preponderant and if on preponderance of
probabilities the charge could not be proved on the departmental
side, it can hardly be said to be proved beyond all reasonable doubt
in a criminal trial, is what was held by the Co-ordinate Bench in the
aforesaid writ petition, which was followed by another Co-ordinate
Bench in all the aforesaid cases. The petitioner herein is shown to
have appeared for the 2nd respondent/University in all the cases
except one case which is Criminal Petition No.101638 of 2021
disposed of on 7.04.2022. After the disposal of all the petitions, the
petitioner communicates to the University that the Court has
allowed the petitions and he had appeared for the University. In all
the 10 matters it is recorded that the petitioner had appeared and
in the connected matter which was disposed of on 7.04.2022, the
name of the petitioner is not shown. Based upon this, prodigious
action is taken against the petitioner.
4. The petitioner is removed from the panel by the University
which power the University always had. Not stopping at that, the
impugned crime is registered against the petitioner for offences
punishable under Sections 417, 420, 196, 199, 201 and 205 of the
IPC by registering a criminal complaint before the jurisdictional
Police, that he has connived with the opponents and has seen to it
that the criminal petitions are allowed. The complaint is registered
on 27-07-2022.     Two days later, an FIR comes to be registered on
29-07-2022 on quoting the orders passed by a Co-ordinate Bench
of this Court. Again not stopping at that, a newspaper publication is
said to have been made against the petitioner describing him that
he has cheated the University branding him as guilty of offences
punishable under the afore-quoted provisions.      It is these acts of
the University that drives the petitioner to this Court in the subject
5. Heard Sri Shivaprasad Shantanagoudar, learned counsel
appearing for the petitioner, Sri K.S.Abhijith, learned High Court
Government Pleader appearing for respondent No.1 and Sri Murthy
D.Naik, learned senior counsel appearing for respondent No.2.
6. The learned counsel appearing for the petitioner would
contend with vehemence that the petitioner being a panel Advocate
had been appearing for the University for more than 15 years and
has only obeyed the directions of the Court to accept the notice,
since the matter was covered by the judgment rendered by this
Court, as afore-quoted, what the Co-ordinate Bench has done was
only following the earlier judgment. No appeal is filed by the
University against the said orders, though the learned counsel
would submit that applications for recall of the orders are pending
consideration before the Bench which has passed the orders and
would submit, without availing all those remedies which are
available in law, the University in a haste has gone on, to register a
criminal complaint against the petitioner, branding him that he has
cheated the University, removed him from the panel and also saw
to it that the matter appears in the newspaper that the petitioner
has cheated the University. He would submit that if such criminal
complaint is allowed to be registered and proceedings permitted to
continue, the fraternity would be unsafe, as the moment the
Authority would lose the case, it would point its fingers at the
7. On the other hand, the learned senior counsel appearing
for the 2nd respondent/University would only place the explanation
offered by the Registrar who has registered the complaint against
the petitioner and would stop at that and would not lend any
support to the action of the University in registering the crime
against the Advocate who has appeared before the Court on the
direction of the Court, in a matter that is covered by the earlier
8. The learned High Court Government Pleader would only toe
the lines of the learned senior counsel representing the University.
9. I have given my anxious consideration to the submissions
made by the respective learned counsel and perused the available
material on record.
10. Before embarking upon merits of the matter, I deem it
appropriate to trace the genesis of the problem.        Writ Petition
No.19700 of 2018 was disposed of by an order of this Court on
27.07.2021 following the judgment of a three Judge Bench of the
Apex Court in the case of ASHOO SURENDRANATH TEWARI v.
CBI – (2020) 9 SCC 636. This judgment, as on the date of this
Court considering the other cases has become final.        Therefore,
following the said judgment the Co-ordinate Bench allows close to
11 petitions. In all these 11 petitions, the name of the petitioner
was shown to be appearing for the 2nd respondent except in one
case. The averment in the petition is that the Court directed the
petitioner to take notice and, therefore, his name figures.         After
disposal    of   a  particular   petition,   the  petitioner   sent     a
communication to the University informing it that he has appeared
for the University in the said case and the petition has been
allowed. The Court in the said matter did not record the name of
the petitioner as having appeared for the University but in rest of
the matters the name of the counsel is reflected. An error of fact or
a typographical error cannot be ruled out.          The moment the
communication is sent by the petitioner to the University with
regard to allowing of the petitions, the Registrar of the University
springs into action, not for challenging the said orders, not availing
of any remedy available in law to call in question the orders passed
by   the  Co-ordinate    Bench,   but   altogether a   different   route
outlandish,    by  registering  a  criminal    complaint   against   the
petitioner. What is more shocking is the offences so alleged against
the petitioner.
11. Since the entire issue now springs from the complaint, I
deem it appropriate to quote the complaint in extenso for the
purpose of ready reference:

The complaint narrates that in the normal circumstance if an
Advocate has to appear for the University, it has to be with due
authorization.         The          petitioner            has        appeared             without            the
authorization of the University and holds that the petitioner has
colluded or connived with the petitioners in those petitions and has
co-operated in allowing all the petitions. It is also noted that Dr.
Premkumar who is arrayed as respondent No.2 in the said petitions
is deliberately shown as Vice-Chancellor though he is not the Vice-
Chancellor and, therefore, the petitioner has colluded. It is further
alleged that the petitioner had made false submission before the
Court and, therefore, has become open for punishment for the
offences punishable under Sections 417, 420, 196, 199, 201 and
205 of the IPC.      What pervades through the entire complaint is
preposterity       and       absolute      recklessness        of    the
complainant/University, which is represented by the Registrar.
12. It now becomes necessary to notice the offences alleged
against the petitioner, with reference to the sections of the IPC.
Section 417 IPC. Section 417 reads as follows:
“417. Punishment for cheating.—Whoever cheats shall
be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term
which may extend to one year, or with fine, or with both.”
Section 417 deals with punishment for cheating. Cheating finds its
ingredients in Section 415 of the IPC and reads as follows:
“415. Cheating.—Whoever, by deceiving any person,
fraudulently or dishonestly induces the person so deceived to
deliver any property to any person, or to consent that any
person shall retain any property, or intentionally induces the
person so deceived to do or omit to do anything which he would
not do or omit if he were not so deceived, and which act or
omission causes or is likely to cause damage or harm to that
person in body, mind, reputation or property, is said to “cheat”.
Explanation.—A dishonest concealment of facts is a
deception within the meaning of this section.”
Section 415 directs whoever by deceiving any person,
fraudulently or dishonestly induces the person so deceived to
deliver any property to any person becomes open for such
punishment under Section 417.        Who has deceived whom in the
case at hand is not even known and likewise who has induced
whom is not even alleged. Section 417 of the IPC is alleged in thin
Section 420 of the IPC deals with cheating and dishonestly
inducing delivery of property and has its roots in Section 415
(supra) and would also get subsumed for the reasons rendered in
The other offence alleged is Section 196 of the IPC. Section
196 of the IPC deals with using evidence known to be false and
directs whoever corruptly uses or attempts to use as true or
genuine evidence which he known to be false or fabricated. What
the petitioner has done in the case at hand is accepting or
appearing in cases where the issue in those cases stood covered by
a judgment rendered by this Court which had become final.
Therefore, Section 196 of the IPC cannot even be seen to be
alleged against the petitioner.
Section 199 of the IPC is also alleged which reads as follows:
“199. False statement made in declaration which is
by law receivable as evidence.—Whoever, in any declaration
made or subscribed by him, which declaration any Court of
Justice, or any public servant or other person, is bound or
authorised by law to receive as evidence of any fact, makes any
statement which is false, and which he either knows or believes
to be false or does not believe to be true, touching any point
material to the object for which the declaration is made or used,
shall be punished in the same manner as if he gave false
evidence.”
Section 199 deals with false statement made in declaration which is
by law receivable as evidence. There is no false declaration made
before any Court of justice by the petitioner. In a covered matter
there need not be even any statement made. The University was
served and unrepresented in most of the cases. In such a case, it
was open to this Court to even dispose of the petition without
notifying any counsel.
Section 201 of the IPC is also alleged which reads as follows:
“201. Causing disappearance of evidence of offence,
or giving false information to screen offender.—Whoever,
knowing or having reason to believe that an offence has been
committed, causes any evidence of the commission of that
offence to disappear, with the intention of screening the
offender from legal punishment, or with that intention gives any
information respecting the offence which he knows or believes
if a capital offence.—shall, if the offence which he
knows or believes to have been committed is punishable with
death, be punished with imprisonment of either description for a
term which may extend to seven years, and shall also be liable
if punishable with imprisonment for life.—and if the
offence is punishable with 237[imprisonment for life], or with
imprisonment which may extend to ten years, shall be punished
with imprisonment of either description for a term which may
extend to three years, and shall also be liable to fine;
if    punishable   with      less    than      ten years'
imprisonment.—and if the offence is punishable with
imprisonment for any term not extending to ten years, shall be
punished with imprisonment of the description provided for the
offence, for a term which may extend to one-fourth part of the
longest term of the imprisonment provided for the offence, or
with fine, or with both.”
Section 201 of the IPC deals with causing disappearance of
evidence of offence or giving false information to screen the
offender. It is beyond comprehension as to how this offence is
alleged against the petitioner who has appeared before Court of law
and the Court recorded his name in a matter that stood covered by
the earlier judgment. It cannot be even seen in what way
disappearance of evidence is caused by the petitioner.
Section 205 of the IPC reads as follows:
proceeding in suit or prosecution.—Whoever falsely
personates another, and in such assumed character makes any
admission or statement, or confesses judgment, or causes any
process to be issued or becomes bail or security, or does any
other act in any suit or criminal prosecution, shall be punished
with imprisonment of either description for a term which may
extend to three years, or with fine, or with both.”
This section deals with false personation for purpose of act or
proceeding in suit or prosecution. The Section directs that whoever
falsely personates another.       The petitioner has not impersonated
anybody.        His name does figure as appearing for the 2nd
respondent on it being recorded by the Court. Therefore, all these
offences that are alleged are alleged without any basis and it is on
the face of it mischievous and preposterous act of the University to
say the least.
13. The complaint is registered before the jurisdictional Police
on 27-07-2022.       48 hours later, the FIR is registered in Crime
No.163 of 2022. The Police ought to have enquired with the
veracity of allegation before registering a crime against an Advocate
without there being any substance in the allegation. It is for this
reason of registration of reckless complaint by the machinery of the
State the Apex Court in the case of ARNESH KUMAR V. STATE OF
BIHAR or in the case of LALITA KUMARI V. STATE OF U.P. has
warned the Police machinery with caution not to indulge in
registering the complaint or arresting the accused in the complaint.
Therefore, the complaint on the face of it is tainted with mala fides,
allegations are inherently improbable and even if the facts qua the
allegations are noticed, they would not make out a crime against
the petitioner. Therefore, such frivolous complaint, if permitted to
continue, would be putting a premium on the mischief generated by
the University, to settle its scores on a panel counsel who has
represented the University before a Court of law and who has been
representing the University for ages. It is, therefore, the FIR
requires to be obliterated.
14. The University does not stop at the registration of the
complaint. It removed the petitioner from the panel of the
University which power the University does have and always had.
But, the order of removal again shocks the conscience of the Court.
The order of removal reads as follows:
ªÀw¬ÄAzÀ ªÀeÁUÉÆ½¹ ¸ÀzÀjAiÀÄªÀgÀ «gÀÄzÀÞ vÀÄvÁðV I.P.C. CrAiÀÄ°è ªÀÄvÀÄÛ Advocate

The power of removal is not alien to the University, but the manner
in which the petitioner has been removed is maligning him to the
fullest. It is on such maligning, he has been removed. The
cascading effect of registration of crime against the petitioner is
that it is carried by majority of newspapers – that the University
has filed a case against the lawyer as he had appeared before the
High Court without permission and the news has now spread like
the whirlwind. The reputation of the petitioner is thus maligned all
for the reason that the crime is registered against the petitioner.
15. The crime is registered against the petitioner all for the
reason that he has appeared before the Court in the capacity of him
representing the University for long years as its panel Advocate. He
is removed from the panel only on 08.07.2022. Thus he was in the
panel and represented the University in all the cases before the
Dharwad Bench. The petitioner for having acted as an officer of the
Court is now sought to be hauled into these proceedings. The role
of the officer of the Court is recognized by the judgments rendered
by the Apex Court in several cases. I deem it appropriate to notice
and    quote   a   few.    The   Apex   Court    in  the   case   of   R.
MUTHUKRISHNAN v. REGISTRAR GENERAL, HIGH CO0URT OF
JUDICATURE AT MADRAS1 has held as follows:
“44. The Bar Council has the power to discipline lawyers
and maintain nobility of profession and that power imposes
great responsibility. The court has the power of contempt and
that lethal power too accompanies with greater responsibility.
Contempt is a weapon like Brahmastra to be used sparingly to
remain effective. At the same time, a Judge has to guard the
dignity of the court and take action in contempt and in case of
necessity to impose appropriate exemplary punishment too. A
lawyer is supposed to be governed by professional ethics,
professional etiquette and professional ethos which are a
habitual mode of conduct. He has to perform himself with
elegance, dignity, and decency. He has to bear himself at all
times and observe himself in a manner befitting as an officer of
the court. He is a privileged member of the community and a
gentleman. He has to mainsail with honesty and sail with the
oar of hard work, then his boat is bound to reach to the bank.
He has to be honest, courageous, eloquent, industrious, witty
and judgmental.
45. In a keynote address to the 1992 Conference of the
English, Scottish and Australian Bar Association held in London
on 4-7-1992 on the “Independence of the Bench; the
Independence of the Bar and the Bar's Role in the Judicial
AC, KBE, Chief Justice of Australia has pointed out that for its
independence the Court should be responsible for its own
administration and the expenditure of funds appropriated to it
by Parliament. He has also referred to one of the
recommendations made by an economist that financial
incentives should be offered to Judges to expedite the
disposition of cases, in that regard he has observed that
incentive-based remuneration, no matter how well adapted it is
to the football stadium and the production line has no place in
the courtroom. Judicial independence is a privilege of and
protection for the people. The appointment of the Judges should
be from the dedicated advocates. With respect to the
independence of the Bar, he has mentioned that lawyers stand
between the subject and the Crown, and between the rich and
the poor, the powerful and the weak. It is necessary that while
the Bar occupies an essential part in the administration of
justice, the lawyer should be completely independent and work
entirely as an individual, drawing on his own resources of
learning, ability, and intelligence. Next, he has referred to Sir
Owen Dixon when he became the Chief Justice of Australia,
“Because it is the duty of the Barrister to stand
between the subject and the Crown, and between the rich
and the poor, the powerful and the weak, it is necessary
that, while the Bar occupies an essential part in the
administration of justice, the Barrister should be
completely independent and work entirely as an
individual, drawing on his own resources of learning,
ability, and intelligence.”
46. A lawyer has to balance between the duty to the
court and interests of his clients. A lawyer has to be
independent. He has observed thus:
between the court and the Barrister is the special
duty which the Barrister owes to the court over and
above the duty which the Barrister owes to the
client. The performance of that duty contributes to
the efficient disposition of litigation. In the
performance of that duty the independence of the
Barrister, allied to his familiarity with the judicial
process, gives him a particular advantage. In
balancing his duty to the court and that owed to the
client, the Barrister is free from the allegiances and
interests and the closer and continuing association which
the solicitor has with the client. The significance of the
Barrister's special duty to the court and the expectation
that it will be performed played a part in the recognition
of the common law's immunity of the Barrister from in-
court liability for negligence. That immunity is founded
partly on the existence of the duty and its performance
with beneficial consequences for the curial process. So
much is clear from the speeches in the House of Lords
in Rondel v. Worsley [Rondel v. Worsley, (1969) 1 AC 191
: (1967) 3 WLR 1666 (HL)] and Saif Ali v. Sydney Mitchell
& Co. [Saif Ali v. Sydney Mitchell & Co., 1980 AC 198:
(1978) 3 WLR 849 (HL)] and the majority judgments in
the           High         Court        of         Australia
in Giannarelli v. Wraith [Giannarelli   v. Wraith, (1988)
which confronts it is to re-affirm its traditional
professional ideals and aspire to excellence. The
professional ideal is not the pursuit of wealth but
public service. That is the vital difference between
professionalism and commercialism.
It is timely to repeat what O'Connor, J. (with whom
Rehnquist,      C.J.   and    Scalia,  J.   agreed)    said
in Shapero v. Kentucky Bar Assn. [Shapero v. Kentucky
475 : 486 US 466 (1988)] : (SCC OnLine US SC para 43)
‘43. One distinguishing feature of any profession,
unlike other occupations that may be equally respectable,
is that membership entails an ethical obligation to temper
one's selfish pursuit of economic success by adhering to
standards of conduct that could not be enforced either by
legal fiat or through the discipline of the market. There
are sound reasons to continue pursuing the goal that is
implicit in the traditional view of processional life. Both
the special privileges incident to membership in the
professional and the advantages those privileges give in
the necessary task of earning a living are means to a goal
that transcends the accumulation of wealth.
Unless the Bar dedicates itself to the ideal of public
service, it forfeits its claim to treatment as a profession in
the true sense of the term. Dedication to public service
demands not only attainment of a high standard of
professional skill but also faithful performance of duty to
client and court and a willingness to make the
professional service available to the public.’”
It is also apposite to refer to the judgment reported in RONDEL v.
WORSLEY2 wherein the Court of Appeal has held as follows:
There is, in my judgment, a sure ground on which to rest
the immunity of a barrister. At any rate, so far as concerns his
conduct of a case in court. It is so that he may do his duty
fearlessly and independently as he ought: and to prevent him
being harassed by vexatious actions such as this present one
now before us. It is like the ground on which a judge cannot be
sued for an act done in his judicial capacity, however corrupt:
see Scott v. Stansfield; and on which a witness cannot be sued
for what he says in giving evidence, however perjured: see
Dawkins v. Lord Rokeby; Hargreaves v. Bretherton; and on
which an advocate cannot be sued for slander for what he says
in court, however malicious: see Munster v. Lamb.
All the reasons given in those cases apply as well to a suit
against a barrister for negligence. As an advocate he is a
minister of justice equally with the judge. He has a monopoly of
audience in the higher courts. No one save he can address the
judge, unless it be a litigant in person. This carries with it a
corresponding responsibility. A barrister cannot pick or choose
his clients. He is bound to accept a brief for any man who comes
before the courts. No matter how great a rascal the man may
be. No matter how given to complaining. No matter how
undeserving or unpopular his cause. The barrister must defend
him to the end. Provided only that he is paid a proper fee, or in
the case of a dock brief, a nominal fee. He must accept the brief
and do all he honourably can on behalf of his client. I say “all he
honourably can” because his duty is not only to his client. He
has a duty to the court which is paramount. It is a mistake to
suppose that he is the mouthpiece of his client to say what he
wants: or his tool to do what he directs. He is none of these
things. He owes allegiance to a higher cause. It is the cause of
truth and justice. He must not consciously mis-state the facts.
He must not knowingly conceal the truth. He must not unjustly
make a charge of fraud, that is, without evidence to support it.
He must produce all the relevant authorities, even those that
are against him. He must see that his client discloses, if
ordered, the relevant documents, even those that are fatal to
his case. He must disregard the most specific instructions
of his client, if they conflict with his duty to the court. The
code which requires a barrister to do all this is not a code
of law. It is a code of honour. If he breaks it, he is
offending against the rules of the profession and is
subject to its discipline. But he cannot be sued in a court
of law.
Such being his duty to the court, the barrister must
be able to do it fearlessly. He has time and time again to
choose between his duty to his client and his duty to the
court. This is a conflict often difficult to resolve: and he should
not be under pressure to decide it wrongly. Mr. Zander says that
when a barrister puts first his duty to the court, he has nothing
to fear. He has not been negligent and cannot be made liable.
But that is too simple by far. It is a fearsome thing for a
barrister to have an action brought against him. To have his
reputation besmirched by a charge of negligence. To have the
case tried all over again but this time with himself, the counsel,
as the defendant. To be put to all the anxiety and, I would add,
all the cost of defending himself. Even though in the end he
should win. Faced with this prospect, a barrister would do all he
could to avoid it. Rather than risk it, he would forever be looking
over his shoulder to forestall it. He would be tempted to ask
every question suggested by the client, however irrelevant; to
call every witness desired by the client, however useless; to
take every point, however bad; to prolong the trial inordinately:
in case the client should be aggrieved and turn round on him
and sue him for negligence. If a barrister is to be able to do his
duty fearlessly and independently, he must not be subject to the
threat of an action for negligence.
Another ground of public policy is this: If a barrister could
be sued for negligence, it would mean a retrial of the original
case. Damage is the gist of an action for negligence. In order to
succeed the plaintiff would have to show that he was wrongly
convicted. See what this means. Illustrate it by this very case of
Rondel. He has already been tried by a jury and been convicted.
He has already put his complaint against his counsel before the
Court of Criminal Appeal. If there had been any miscarriage of
justice, the court would have taken steps to correct it. They
were satisfied there was none. They rejected his application. Is
he to be allowed to canvass his guilt or innocence again in a civil
court? And try the case afresh in an action against his own
counsel? I cannot think this would be right. Once a man has
been convicted by a jury of a crime and his appeal rejected, he
should not be permitted to challenge it again in a civil court. He
cannot sue the judge, saying that he misdirected the jury. He
cannot sue a witness, saying that he committed wilful perjury.
Nor should he be permitted to sue his own counsel, saying that
he was negligent. Test it this way. Suppose he were to succeed,
as between himself and his counsel. in showing that he was
wrongly convicted. The Crown would not be bound by that
decision. We should have a criminal court sentencing him to
imprisonment on the footing that he was guilty, and a civil court
awarding him damages on the footing that he was not
guilty…….”
16. In the light of the judgments so rendered by the Apex
Court and the Court of Appeal as afore-quoted, the role of an officer
of the Court and him being sued is what is deprecated. The
petitioner being an officer of the Court had a duty towards the
Court over and above the duty towards the client, more so being a
panel counsel for long years, had a duty to balance the role of being
an officer of the Court and the panel counsel. In the teeth of the
aforesaid facts if further proceedings are permitted to be continued,
it would, on the face of it, become an abuse of the process of law
and result in grave miscarriage of justice. Therefore, further
proceedings require to be obliterated.
17. It becomes germane to notice the action of the
University, which is a State under Article 12 of the Constitution of
India, in registering such complaint against its panel counsel
without conduct of any preliminary enquiry to get to know the
veracity of the truth in the allegations and make reckless
allegations against the petitioner. The University cannot indulge in
such acts of registering crime against the counsel who appears
before the Court on its behalf and when the result in the suit or
petition goes against the University. Merely because cases are lost,
the counsel cannot be alleged of fraud, cheating, impersonation or
of other reckless allegations that are made.
18. As observed hereinabove, the allegations in the complaint
sans complete substance. Therefore, the University is hereby
cautioned not to indulge in such acts by registering complaints in a
hottest haste and maligning the names of Advocates who appear
for them, after appointing them to its panel to represent the Courts,
unless the University has adequate information or substance which
can prima facie demonstrate that there has been fraud played by its
panel counsel or the University has been cheated by the panel
counsel. The act of the petitioner in representing the University
before the Court and the Court allowing the petitions following an
earlier judgment holding it to be covered can never lead to
registration of the crime for the aforesaid offences. The University
or   the  Registrar   who   has  now   sought   to  explain  out the
circumstances, is admonished and is directed to exercise caution
while registering such reckless complaints in hottest haste. Any
such iteration of the kind of haste, as seen in the case at hand,
would be viewed seriously.
19. For the aforesaid reasons, I pass the following:
(i)   The Criminal Petition is allowed.
(ii)  The FIR registered in Crime No.163 of 2022 dated
29.07.2022 before the Thilaknagar Police Station and all
further proceedings arising thereto and pending before
the XXXVII Additional Chief Metropolitan Magistrate,
Bengaluru stands quashed.
