Present:     Mr. Narender Pal Bhardwaj, Advocate, for the petitioner.
The petitioner is a student of 10th semester of BA LLB
(Honours) course being conduced by the Institute of Law, Kurukshetra
University, Kurukshetra.     FIR No.138, dated 23.02.2022 was registered
against him at Police Station Ladwa, Kurukshetra under Sections 148, 149,
323, 325, 379-B, 506, 120-B IPC and Section 25 of the Arms Act 1959.
Section 25 of the Arms Act, 1959 and Section 379-B have since been
deleted and Section 307 IPC has been added. Petitioner was arrested on
05.03.2022. Investigation is complete and challan has been presented on
05.04.2022.     Copy thereof has also been supplied to the petitioner on
30.04.2022. While in custody, he was permitted to take the viva/practical
examination from 27.04.2022 to 29.04.2022 and 10.05.2022 as permission
was granted by the trial Court. Thereafter, he applied for permission to
appear in the theory examination and permission has been granted.
However, vide letter dated 20.05.2022 issued by respondent No.1, the
Civil Writ Petition No.11487 of 2022                                 --2--
petitioner has been debarred from taking the said examination on account of
shortage of lectures. Thus, this writ petition has been filed for directing
respondents No.1 & 2 to permit the petitioner to take the theory examination
scheduled from 20.05.2022 to 15.06.2022.
Learned counsel for the petitioner has submitted that shortage
in lectures being on account of reasons beyond the control of the petitioner
he should have been permitted to take the theory examination. For this
purpose, reliance has been placed upon Salil Trikha vs. Guru Nanak Dev
University, Amritsar and another, 2011(1) SCT 587 and Preeti Mulji
Sondarwa and others vs. Controller of Examinations, University of
Mumbai and others, 2015(14) SCT 661. Further, it has been submitted that
according to Rule 12 of the Rules of Legal Education, 2008 framed by the
Bar Council of India, requirement of minimum attendance is 70% in one
semester, whereas respondent No.1 has stated in the impugned
communication dated 20.05.2022 that it is 75%. Even the Dean of the
University or the Principal of the College have been given the power to
allow a student to take the examination if he has attended 65% of the
classes. Thus, for this reason also, the petitioner deserves to be granted
Sh. Amarjit Singh Virk, Advocate has put in appearance on
behalf of respondents No.1, 2, 5 & 6 as advance notice of the writ petition
was received by him. He submits that provision of minimum 75% of classes
is based upon Clause 4 of the University Ordinance. The same will prevail
over the Bar Council of India Rules. The judgments relied upon by learned
Civil Writ Petition No.11487 of 2022                                    --3--
counsel for the petitioner are not applicable, instead, judgment dated
12.03.2019 passed in CWP-6572 of 2019, Gaurav Dahiya (minor) through
his father vs. Central Board of School Education, Delhi and others would
apply. It is also stated that the petitioner has attended only 43% lectures.
Thus, the writ petition deserves to be dismissed.
The minimum percentage of lectures/classes required to be
attended is not in issue in this writ petition. The only issue is whether in the
circumstances of this case, petitioner deserves to be permitted to take the
In Salil Trikha (supra), the petitioner was hospitalized from
24.09.2009 to 30.09.2009 on account of a surgery.             He was advised
complete rest upto 14.10.2009. Prior to the operation, he had to undergo
various tests on account of which he had to miss classes. Thus, he was not
permitted to take the semester examination on account of shortage of
lectures. On approaching this Court, the writ petition was allowed and
shortage of lectures was condoned. In Preeti Mulji Sondarwa (supra), the
Ordinance of the University of Mumbai was being interpreted which
provided for condoning the shortage of lectures if supporting material was
available. Neither of these cases are applicable to the facts of this case as
the petitioner was not prevented from attending classes on account of
medical reasons nor interpretation of the University Ordinance is being
On the contrary, the judgment in Gaurav Dahiya (supra) is
squarely applicable. In this case, the student was tried by the Juvenile

Justice Board on account of registration of an FIR. He was acquitted but
was not permitted to take the Class-X examination on account of shortage
of attendance. The writ petition was dismissed upon a consideration of Rule
14 of the Examination Bye-Laws framed by the Central Board of Secondary
Education wherein being confined in judicial custody was not mentioned as
one of the grounds for condoning shortage of attendance. In the instant case
also, Clause 4 of the University Ordinance does not provide for condonation
of shortage of attendance on account of being in judicial custody. Shortage
can be condoned provided the same is on account of participation in Sports
Events, Youth Festivals, University Level Debates, NCC Camps, attendance
of Mountaineering Courses, Voluntary Donation of Blood, attendance of
All India Moot Court/Debate competitions and attendance of extension
lecture(s) organized by the National Institute of Law/Department of Law.
Thus, the first respondent was justified in issuing communication dated
The writ petition has no merit and is accordingly dismissed.
