The present writ petition is filed by the Public
Information Officer seeking to quash the order dated
04.01.2018 passed by the 1st respondent in Appeal
No.KIC/7065/APL/2016 at Annexure-E and the order dated
15.04.2016 passed by the First Appellate Authority in
Appeal       No.LOK/RGR/RTI-A/Appeal-119/2015-16          at
2.   The 1st respondent has dismissed the appeal
filed by the Public Information Officer on the ground that
the petitioner being the Public Information Officer cannot
maintain the second appeal under Section 19(3) of the
Right to Information Act (‘RTI Act’ for short) and the
appeal is not maintainable when the appeal under Section
19(1) of the RTI Act is not preferred by the present
petitioner and accordingly, dismissed the second appeal of
the petitioner.
3.    Learned counsel for the petitioner would submit
that the issue in the lis is squarely covered by the decision
of this Court and it is no more res integra and would
submit that the second appeal under Section 19(3) of the
RTI Act by the Public Information Officer is maintainable
even in the event no first appeal is preferred under
Section 19(1) of the RTI Act and relied upon the judgment
of the Co-Ordinate Bench of this Court in the case of Sri.
G.H. Sharanappa Vs. The Commissioner and Others
in W.P. No.5474/2018 dated 18.11.2022 at paragraph
Nos.14 and 15 held as under:
“14.      The   procedure    contemplated    under
Section 19 is an appellate procedure.      A right of
appeal is always a creature of the statute.      It is
valuable   statutory   right   conferred   upon    an
aggrieved person to enter a superior forum for
invoking its aid and interposition to correct error of
the inferior forum, which is a very valuable right.
Therefore, when the statute confers such a right of
appeal, that must be exercised by a person who is
aggrieved.    One aspect is clear that the statute
confers the right of appeal to be exercised by any
WP No. 24537 of 2018
person aggrieved not confining itself to the refusal
or reason to furnish.
15. When a specific remedy is available to
the aggrieved party under the Act to prefer an
appeal under sub-Section (1) and second appeal
under sub-Section (3) of Section 19, in view of
specific provision, the Commissioner is not justified
in issuing the endorsement to the effect that the
petitioner has not exhausted the remedy under
Sections 6(1) and 19(1) of the RTI Act, defeating
the very provisions of the Act. This Court accepts
the arguments advanced by the learned counsel for
the petitioner and comes to the conclusion that the
appeal under sub-clause (3) of Section 19 of the
Act   can   be   filed by  the  petitioner  and   the
endorsement issued by the 1st respondent is not
sustainable.”
5.     In order to maintain parity, this Court is of the
considered view that the writ petition needs to be disposed
of in terms of the judgment of the Co-ordinate Bench of this
Court in W.P. No.5474/2018, dated 18.11.2022.
6.     Accordingly, this Court pass the following:
WP No. 24537 of 2018
i.   The writ petition is allowed-in-part.
ii.  The impugned order dated 04.01.2018 passed by
the        1st      respondent       in      Appeal
No.KIC/7065/APL/2016 at Annexure-E is hereby
set-aside.
iii. The parties are relegated to the 1st respondent
and the 1st respondent to reconsider the appeal
filed by the petitioner under Section 19 (3) of the
RTI Act on merits, within an outer limit of six
months from the date of receipt of certified copy
of this order, in accordance with law.
iv.  All contentions of the parties are kept open to be
urged before the 1st respondent-authority.
Accordingly, the writ petition stands disposed of.
