2.       This petition takes exception to the judgment and order
dated 26th August, 2019 passed by the learned Judge of the
Allahabad High Court.        The appellants invoked Section 482 of
the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (for short ‘Cr.P.C.’) for
quashing a First Information Report (FIR) registered at the
instance of the respondent no.4. The main ground of challenge
by the appellants who were arraigned as accused in the FIR filed
by the respondent no.4 was that it was the second FIR based on
the same set of facts on which the earlier FIR was registered again
at the instance of the respondent no.4.         By the impugned
judgment, the High Court declined to exercise its jurisdiction
under Section 482 of Cr.P.C.
3.    An agreement for sale dated 14 th June, 2006 was executed
by and between the appellants and four others as the vendors
and one Prasidh Narayan Rai (the deceased husband of the
respondent no.4) as the purchaser. The agreement for sale was
executed by the appellants and four others in respect of their
5/6th undivided share in House Nos. B.12/120A, B.12/121,
B.12/122,    B.12/124    and   B.12/125     situated   at   Mohalla
Gauriganj, Nagar Nigam Ward Bhelupura, Varanasi city and
House No. B. 15/71, B. 15/72, B. 15/81 and B. 15/91 situated
city. The agreed consideration was Rs.19,80,000/­.        A sum of
Rs.15,00,000/­ was paid by the late husband of the respondent
no.4 to the appellant and other vendors as earnest money. In the
year 2014, a written complaint was made by the respondent no.4
to the Station House Officer (S.H.O.) Police Station Bhelupur,
Varanasi. In the said complaint, it was alleged by the respondent
no.4 that after death of her husband, the appellant no.1 sold his
share in the subject property on 27 th July, 2013 to the appellant
no.2. It was alleged that the appellants have committed offences
of fraud and forgery. According to the case of the appellant, as
per the information furnished to them under the Right to
Information Act, 2005 by the officer in charge of Bhelupur Police
station, the allegations in the complaint made by the respondent
no.4 were found to be untrue and therefore, no action was taken
on the complaint.
4.    On 2nd April, 2015, on the basis of information furnished by
the respondent no.4, First Information Report No.0109 (for short
‘the first FIR’) was registered against the appellant nos.1 and 2 at
Bhelupur Police station.      The said FIR specifically refers to the
agreement of 14th June, 2006 executed by the appellants and
others. It alleges that the appellant no.1 sold his undivided share
on 27th July, 2013 to the appellant no.2, who is also shown as
accused in the said FIR. It is alleged that the appellant nos.1 and
2 along with others met the respondent no.4 on 12th October,
2014. At that time, the appellants hurled abuses and they also
threatened her.     Offences punishable under Sections 406, 419,
420, 467, 468, 504, 506 IPC were alleged in the FIR.
5.    The appellants approached the High Court of Allahabad by
invoking Section 482 of Cr.P.C. for quashing the first FIR. It is
stated in the present appeal that the said petition for quashing
is pending in Allahabad High Court in which there is an interim
order restraining the Police from taking coercive action on the
basis of the first FIR.   The interim order was passed on 17 th
6.    The respondent no.4 filed a civil suit in the Civil Court at
Varanasi in the year 2017 against the appellants and four others
for specific performance of the said agreement dated 14 th June,
2006. The said suit is being contested by the appellants.
7.    On 13th September 2019, the respondent no.4 lodged one
more FIR being FIR No.0177 in the same Police Station in which
the appellants herein were shown as accused.        The allegations
made by the respondent no.4 in FIR No.0177 (for short ‘the
second FIR’) are more or less identical to the allegations made in
the first FIR. The property subject matter of both the FIRs is the
same.     The second FIR also refers to an agreement for sale
executed by the appellants and others in favour of the husband of
the respondent no.4 and that out of the agreed consideration
of Rs.19,80,000/­, the appellants have received a sum of
Rs.15,00,000/­. It is further alleged that instead of executing the
sale deed on the basis of the agreement for sale, the appellants
sold the property to certain other persons by forging the
documents and by concealing the agreement. The only difference
in the two FIRs is that in the first FIR, the date of the agreement
is mentioned as 14th June 2006 whereas in the second FIR, the
date is mentioned as 21st June 2006. Moreover, the second FIR
refers to the civil suit filed by the respondent no.4. The second
FIR also alleges the commission of offences punishable under
Sections 419, 420, 406, 467, 468, 471 of IPC.
8.    The appellants filed a petition under Section 482 of Cr.P.C.
before the High Court questioning the second FIR. The High
Court, by the judgment and order dated 11 th April 2019, directed
that the appellants shall not be arrested till submission of police
report under sub­section (2) of Section 173 of Cr.P.C. Thereafter,
a charge sheet was filed on the basis of the second FIR on 9 th
June 2019 and a summoning order was passed thereon by the
learned Magistrate. The appellants again moved the High Court
by way of a petition under Section 482 of Cr.P.C.            seeking
quashing of the charge sheet as well as summoning order issued
on the basis of the second FIR. By the impugned judgement, the
learned Judge of the High Court held that a prime facie case to
proceed against the appellants was made out.
9.     We have heard the learned counsel appearing for the
appellants who submitted that both the first and second FIRs are
based on the same set of facts and the same cause of action.
Relying upon decisions of this Court in the case of Upkar Singh
v. Ved Prakash1 and T.T. Antony v. State of Kerala2, the
learned counsel submitted that registration of second FIR is a
gross abuse of process of law.
10. Though the respondent no.4 has been served, she has not
chosen to appear. The learned counsel representing the State of
U.P on instructions stated that though in the counter filed by the
State, a contention is raised that the second FIR is based on a
different agreement, the said statement is not factually correct
and that the second FIR is also based on the same agreement
dated 14th June 2006. The learned counsel appearing for the
appellants submitted that as stated in the rejoinder, the
agreement dated 14th June 2006 was registered on 21st/22nd June
2006 and that is how in the second FIR, the date of agreement
may have been mentioned as 21st June 2006.
11. We have perused both the FIRs. The respondent no.4 is the
first informant in both the FIRs and the same are based on the
same agreement for sale executed on 14 th June 2006.            The
allegation made in both the FIRs is the same. The allegation is
that by practising forgery and fraud, the appellant no.1 has sold
the subject property to appellant no.2 thereby deceiving the
respondent no.4. The second FIR, which is the subject matter of
challenge, was registered nearly four years after the first FIR was
registered.  The challenge to the first FIR is pending before the
High Court. These aspects have been completely overlooked by
the High Court in the impugned judgment.
12. If multiple First Information Reports by the same person
against the same accused are permitted to be registered in respect
of the same set of facts and allegations, it will result in the
accused getting entangled in multiple criminal proceedings for the
same alleged offence. Therefore, the registration of such multiple
FIRs is nothing but abuse of the process of law. Moreover, the act
of the registration of such successive FIRs on the same set of facts
and allegations at the instance of the same informant will not
stand the scrutiny of Articles 21 and 22 of the Constitution of
India.    The settled legal position on this behalf has been
completely ignored by the High Court.
13. Accordingly, the appeal must succeed. The FIR No. 0177 of
2019 registered at Bhelupur Police Station in District Varanasi,
charge sheet dated 12th July 2019 on the basis of the said FIR and
the summoning order dated 12th July 2019 passed by the Court of
ACJM, Varanasi in Criminal Case No. 480 of 2019 are thereby
quashed and set aside. No order as to costs.
Petition(s)   for  Special   Leave   to   Appeal   (Crl.)    No(s).
(Arising out of impugned final judgment and order dated 26-08-
2019 in A482 No. 32440/2019 passed by the High Court Of
Date : 23-08-2022 This matter was called on for hearing today.
UPON hearing the counsel the Court made the following
Leave granted.
Appeal is allowed in terms of the signed order.
Pending application(s), if any, shall stand disposed of.
