Further to the order dated 8th February, 2022
passed by the bench presided over by the Hon’ble the
Chief Justice, W.P.A.(P) 46 of 2022 (Tanweer Ahmed
Khan and Ors. –vs- The State of West Bengal and Ors.)
is treated as on the day’s list.
By March, 2020 there was a sudden, widespread
and most serious onset in our country of the pandemic
caused by the Covid-19 virus. Physical education had to
be discontinued. It was substituted by online education.
Online education generated its own problems.
On    one    hand,     the  students     or  their
parents/guardians complained that the schools and
other educational institutions continued to charge them
fees which were disproportionately high considering the
type of education imparted online. They said that
although physical education had been discontinued, the
schools    and   other   educational  institutions  were
charging them for facilities and services which could
only be rendered when education was physical. On the
other hand, the management of a body of schools and
other educational institutions were aggrieved by non-
payment or short payment of fees by the students. It
was alleged on behalf of the students that services
rendered by those institutions were much reduced by
the online mode, and the parents/guardians were
suffering economic hardship caused by the pandemic.
Hence, fees be reduced.
This court intervened through this public interest
litigation to mitigate this problem. By the order of this
bench dated 13th October, 2020, directions were made
for smooth conduct of education in schools and other
educational institutions covered by this litigation during
this period. The most important part of it was that the
schools and other educational institutions could only
charge fees for essential services rendered online, with
20% deduction.
As the situation stands today, there is substantial
remission of the effects of the pandemic. Life in all
spheres has become substantially normal.         In fact by
the notification of the State Government dated 14th
February, 2022, even primary and upper primary
schools have been thrown open to physical education
with effect from 16th February, 2022.
Therefore, from now, education in all the schools
and other educational institutions covered by this
public interest litigation would be physical.
Taking note of this situation and after having
heard learned counsel appearing for the respective
parties, we are of the view that the interim orders which
are operating need to be further modified to the
following effect:
(a) With prospective effect from 16th February,
2022, that part of our order permitting deduction of
20% of school fees shall stand vacated.
(b) The schools and other educational institutions
shall be permitted to charge fees according to their
policy and arrangement with the students.
(c) Up to 28th February, 2022,      subject to (d)
below students shall pay the school fees according to
the interim orders made by us prior to this day, for
online classes.
(d) In case of any dispute between the school fees
claimed and the school fees payable according to a
student for the period up to today, 50% (fifty per cent) of
the demand by the school or the admitted amount by
the student, whichever is higher, has to be paid without
prejudice to the rights and contentions of the parties in
this litigation, by 15th March, 2022. Our earlier interim
order with regard to payment of the disputed amount
stands modified to this extent.
(e) Till 31st March, 2022 or until further orders,
whichever is earlier, no coercive action like expulsion of
any student from the school, withholding of admit card
to sit for any Board or school examination, withholding
of mark-sheets or certificates on the ground of default
in payment of school fees, shall be taken by the schools
or other educational       institutions covered   by   this
litigation against any student.
List this application along with the contempt and
any other application on 25th March, 2022.
