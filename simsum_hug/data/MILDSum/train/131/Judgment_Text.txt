BAIL APPLN. NO.2208/2022                                  Page 4 of 16
14.9.2020 and during the search of the house of the co-accused
Rajeev Sharma several articles including some sensitive/
confidential documents         related to     the  Indian  Defence
Department were recovered at the instance of the accused
Rajeev Sharma and during further investigation it was revealed
that the accused Rajeev Sharma was indulging in procurement
of     secret/     confidential/    sensitive    documents/material
information conveying the same to his handlers (Chinese
Intelligence Officers) based in China and in lieu of the same he
was receiving remuneration through illegal means i.e. hawala
transactions/funds through shell companies being operated
through the Chinese persons in India.
10.     Inter alia, it was submitted through the status report that
during further investigation it was revealed that the accused
Rajeev Sharma was in contact with Chinese Intelligence
Officers through        emails and social media platform i.e.
Telegram etc. and the accused Rajeev Sharma was conveying
the information to these Chinese Intelligence Officers and was
receiving the illegal funds through illegal means/shell
companies being operated in Mahipalpur, Delhi, by the Chinese
people on the direction of the Chinese Intelligence Officers.
11.     It was further submitted through the status report that
during the course of the further investigation the co-accused
Qing Shi @ Queen Shi D/o Shi Chaoqun, a Chinese National
and Sher Singh, the applicant herein, a Napalese citizen were
arrested on 19.9.2020 and during investigation it was revealed
BAIL APPLN. NO.2208/2022                                      Page 5 of 16
that MZ Mall Private Limited and MZ Pharmacy Private
Limited were being operated at L-382B, First ·Floor,
Mahipalpur Extn., New Delhi and Mr. Jhang Cheng @ Suraj, a
Chinese national was the Director of these companies and Sher
Singh, the applicant herein, was a co-director of one of these
companies and Ms. Qing Shi and Sher Singh were operating
these companies on behalf of Mr. Jhang Cheng and his
wife/partner Ms . Zhang Lixia as both of them were present in
China. Inter alia through the status report it was averred that the
accused Rajeev Sharma was being funded through these shell
companies on the directions of Chinese Intelligence Officers as
remuneration for the information provided to them by him and
the remuneration to the accused Rajiv Sharma has also been
confirmed by the seudo witnesses during the investigation in
their statements u/s 161 and 164 of the Cr.P.C., 1973.
12.    Inter alia, the State submits that a report from the
Defence Department of India was sought regarding the
sensitive/confidential documents recovered from the house of
accused Rajeev Sharma whereby a reply was received as “Yes”
and that the documents are classified as "CONFIDENTIAL"
vide Para 9 of Classification & Handling of             Classified
Documents (CHCD)-2001 as issued vide Military Intelligence -
11 letter Number. A/38020/MI-11 dated July 2001, and the
person i.e., the accused Rajeev Sharma had unauthorized
possession of the said documents. Inter alia it was submitted
through the status report that it was also mentioned by the
BAIL APPLN. NO.2208/2022                                      Page 6 of 16
DGMI that any unauthorized disclosure of content of these
documents could be expected to cause damage to National
Security or could be prejudicial to the National Interests or
would embarrass the Government in its functioning and the
contents contained in the documents are directly or indirectly
connected with security matters of the country.
13.    The State submits that the accused Rajeev Sharma
granted bail by the Co-ordinate Bench of this Court on
4.12.2020 under Section 167(2) of the Cr.P.C., 1973 and the co-
accused Qing Shi was also granted bail by the Co-ordinate
Bench of this Court under Section 167(2) of the Cr.P.C., 1973
on 28.7.2021.
14.    Undoubtedly, the applicant in the instant case was
arrested on the same date as the co-accused Qing Shi both
having been taken into police custody on 19.9.2020 and put into
judicial custody on 27.9.2020. The co-accused Qing Shi in
terms of order dated 28.7.2021 of the Co-ordinate Bench of this
Court Crl.Rev. Petition No. 82/2021 has been allowed to be
released on default bail. The other main accused in the instant
case Rajeev Sharma vide order dated 4.12.2020 also in Crl.Rev.
Petition No. 363/2020 had been allowed to be released on
default bail in terms of Section 167(2) of the Cr.P.C., 1973.
15.    As has been submitted by the applicant that he did not
seek redressal in terms of Section 167(2) of the Cr.P.C., 1973,
in terms of Section 167(2) of the Cr.P.C., 1973, the provision
for grant of default bail becomes applicable only if the accused
BAIL APPLN. NO.2208/2022                                     Page 7 of 16
person falls within the parameters of Section 167(2)(a)(ii) falls
within the category of a person „who is prepared to and does
furnish bail.‟
16.    In the instant case, admittedly, the applicant had not
chosen to seek the grant of default bail through provisions of
Section 167(2) of the Cr.P.C., 1973 and it is rightly held vide
order dated 20.5.2022 of the Court of the Additional Sessions
Judge-05, New Delhi declining the prayer made by the
applicant seeking the grant of bail observing to the effect that
there is no parity between the applicant and the co-accused
Rajeev Sharma and Qing Shi granted default bail under Section
167(2) of the Cr.P.C., 1973.
17.    This is so in as much as vide a verdict of the Hon‟ble
Supreme Court in Rakesh Kumar Paul V. State of Assam,
(2017) 15 SCC 67 a verdict dated 16.8.2017 in SLP(Crl.)
2009/2017 with SLP (Crl.) No. 2176/2017, the question in para
98.2(ii) thereof which reads to the effect:
“ 98. The three main questions that arise in these
appeals for our consideration are as under:
98.2 (ii) Whether the appellant is entitled to default bail
under Section 167(2) of the Code though he has not
made any application (oral or written) under Section
167(2) of the code before the Magistrate (or Special
Judge), but has instead argued orally without pleadings
in a pending regular bail application filed under
Section 439 of the Code before the High Court?
BAIL APPLN. NO.2208/2022                                     Page 8 of 16
It has been expressly laid down vide paragraph 108 to 113 of
the said verdict to the effect:
““108. The second issue which requires to be
addressed is whether the Appellant is entitled to
statutory bail Under Section 167(2) of the Code
though he has not made any application Under
Section 167(2) of the Code before the
Magistrate(or Special Judge) prior to the filing of
the charge sheet. The record of the case reveals
that the Appellant was arrested on 4.11.2016 and
produced before the Magistrate on 5.11.2016 and
he was remanded to custody for the first time. The
period of sixty days for filing charge sheet expired
on 04.01.2017. The charge sheet came to be filed
on 24.1.2017. Initially the Appellant had applied
for regular bail before the Sessions Court which
came to be rejected on 20.12.2016. Thereafter he
moved bail application No. 23/2017 for bail Under
Section 439 of the Code before the High Court of
Guwahati. This bail application was disposed on
11.01.2017 which was after sixty days of arrest,
but prior to filing of charge sheet. A perusal of this
bail application shows that this bail application
was moved Under Section 439 of the Code for
regular bail on merits and not as a bail claiming
the statutory right Under Section 167 of the Code.
In none of the grounds taken in the bail
application, the Appellant has pleaded for default
bail as a result of non filing of the charge sheet.
All the grounds urged are on merits. The prayer is
also for regular bail. It appears that, prior to the
time of hearing, the counsel for the Appellant has
realised that the Accused was entitled for default
bail Under Section 167(2)and has taken the plea in
the oral arguments in the High Court that since
sixty days for filing charge sheet has expired, he is
entitled to bail as matter of right Under Section
BAIL APPLN. NO.2208/2022                                      Page 9 of 16
167(2) of the Code. The question thus arises,
whether such application on merits can be equated
to be an application seeking enforcement of
statutory right Under Section 167(2) of the Code
and whether such practice of taking such oral
arguments directly before the High Court in a
pending regular bail application without having
taken such grounds in the application or having
approached the Magistrate(or Special Court)
should be entertained.
109. The legal position regarding bail Under
Section 167(2) of the Code was cemented by a
Constitution Bench of this Court which has inter
alia held in the case of Sanjay Dutt v. State
through C.B.I., Bombay that: ...
“53.(2) (b)The "'indefeasible right"
of the Accused to be released on bail
in accordance with Section 20(4)(bb)
of the TADA Act read with Section
167(2) of the Code of Criminal
Procedure in default of completion of
the investigation and filing of the
challan within the time allowed, as
held in Hitendra Vishnu Thakur v.
State of Maharashtra, is a right
which enures to, and is enforceable
by the Accused only from the time of
default till the filing of the challan
and it does not survive or remain
enforceable on the challan being
filed. If the Accused applies for bail
under this provision on expiry of the
period of 180 days or the extended
period, as the case may be, then he
has to be released on bail forthwith.
The accused, so released on bail may
be arrested and committed to custody
according to the provisions of the
BAIL APPLN. NO.2208/2022                                 Page 10 of 16
Code of Criminal Procedure. The
right of the Accused to be released
on bail after filing of the challan,
notwithstanding the default in filing
it within the time allowed, is
governed from the time of filing of
the challan only by the provisions
relating to the grant of bail
applicable at that stage...”
110. In Uday Mohanlal Acharya v. State of
Maharashtra three Judge Bench of this Court had
the occasion to determine when an Accused can
be said to have availed of his indefeasible right
for being released on bail under the proviso to
Section 167(2) of the Code of Criminal
Procedure, if a challan is not filed within the
period stipulated thereunder. The Court held in a
majority of 2:1 that the indefeasible right is said
to be availed at the time when an application is
made for enforcement of the right Under Section
167(2) of the Code and the Accused offers to
abide by the terms and conditions of bail. While
holding so, the court, in para 11, interpreted the
decision in Dr. Bipin Shantilal Panchal v. State of
Gujarat, a three Judge Bench decision of this
Court, as under:
“11. In this case (Dr. Bipin Shantilal
Panchal), the Accused had not made
application for enforcement of his
right accruing under proviso to
Section 167(2) of the Code. But raised
the contention only in the Supreme
Court.     This     Court,    therefore,
formulated the question thus-Whether
the Accused who was entitled to be
released on bail under proviso to Sub-
section (2) of Section 167 of the Code,
not having made an application when
BAIL APPLN. NO.2208/2022                                   Page 11 of 16
such right had accrued, can exercise
that right at a later stage of the
proceeding, and answered in the
negative.”
111. The requirement for making the application
for seeking enforcement of the right Under Section
167(2) has been recognised in several cases. In the
case of Mohamed Iqbal Madar Sheikh v. State of
Maharashtra, this Court rejected the claim for
statutory bail under Section 167(2) of the Code on
the ground that no application was made on that
ground. In para 11 of the judgment the Court held
“ 11.So far the facts of the present
case are concerned, the Appellant
Nos. 1 to 6 were taken into custody
on 16.1.1993. The chargesheet was
submitted on 30.8.1993; obviously
beyond the statutory period Under
Section 20(4)(b). There is nothing
on record to show that provisions of
Section 20(4)(bb) were applied in
respect of Appellants. They had
become entitled to be released on
bail under proviso (a) to Section
167(2) of the Code read with Section
20(4)(b) of the TADA. But it is an
admitted      position    that    no
application for bail on the said
ground was made on behalf of the
Appellants. Unless applications had
been made on behalf of the
Appellants, there was no question of
their being released on ground of
default in completion of the
investigation within the statutory
period. It is now settled that this
right cannot be exercised after the
BAIL APPLN. NO.2208/2022                                   Page 12 of 16
charge-sheet has been submitted
and cognizance has been taken,
because in that event the remand of
the Accused concerned including
one who is alleged to have
committed an offence under TADA,
is not Under Section 167(2) but
under other provisions of the Code.”
112. In Hitendra Vishnu Thakur and Ors. v. State
of Maharashtra and Others, it was held in para 30
“In conclusion, we may (even at the
cost of repetition) say that an Accused
person seeking bail under Section
20(4) has to make an application to the
court for grant of bail on grounds of
the 'default' of the prosecution and the
court shall release the Accused on bail
after notice to the public prosecutor
uninfluenced by the gravity of the
offence or the merits of the prosecution
case since Section 20(8) does not
control the grant of bail Under Section
20(4) of TADA and both the provisions
operate in separate and independent
fields. It is, however, permissible for
the public prosecutor to resist the
grant of bail by seeking an extension
under Clause(bb) by filing a report for
the purpose before the court. However,
no extension shall be granted by the
court without notice to an Accused to
have his say regarding the prayer for
grant of extension under Clause(bb).
In this view of the matter, it is
immaterial whether the application for
bail on ground of' default' Under
Section 20(4) is filed first or the report
BAIL APPLN. NO.2208/2022                                   Page 13 of 16
as envisaged by Clause(bb) is filed by
the public prosecutor first so long as
both are considered while granting or
refusing bail.”
113. The law laid down as above shows that the
requirement of an application claiming the
statutory right Under Section 167(2) of the Code
is a prerequisite for the grant of bail on default.
In my opinion, such application has to be made
before the Magistrate for enforcement of the
statutory right. In the cases under the
Prevention of Corruption Act or other Acts
where Special Courts are constituted by
excluding the jurisdiction of the Magistrate, it
has to be made before such Special Court. In
the present case, for the reasons discussed,
since the Appellant never sought default bail
before the court concerned, as such not entitled
to the same.”            (emphasis supplied),
having thus been held categorically vide paragraph 113 adverted
to herein above that since the applicant therein had not sought
the default bail before the Court concerned , as such he was not
entitled to the same.
18.    In the instant case, admittedly, the applicant did not seek
the grant of default bail though it was stated that it was not
sought because the applicant was not adequately, legally
represented. It is essential to observe that vide observations in
para 11 in the verdict titled Kavita @ Laxmi V. State of NCT of
Delhi; Bail Appln. No. 3062/2021, a verdict dated 15.9.2021 it
was observed by this Court as under:
“11. In the instant case too, there is nothing on the
record to indicate that the applicant had sought grant of
BAIL APPLN. NO.2208/2022                                      Page 14 of 16
any default bail. It is however the submission raised on
behalf of the applicant by learned counsel for the
applicant that the applicant was not legally represented
and it was the bounden duty of the Court to ensure that
there was a compliance of the provisions of Section
167(2) of the Cr.P.C., 1973 as had been made even on
the date 2.6.2017 in relation to the application of the co-
accused named Satbir. In relation to this aspect, it is
essential to observe that vide a verdict dated 14.3.2018 of
this Court in Bail Appln. No. 2238/2017 titled Arvind
Kumar Saxena V. State, there are observations in para
21 of the said verdict whereby it has inter alia been
observed to the effect that the Registrar General of this
Court was requested to explore the possibility of creation
of a database and software for the District Courts of
Delhi for updation of the date in relation to the pending
remand applications during the course of investigation
pending before the Trial Courts with the dates of arrest
and dates by when the requisite chare-sheet is to be filed
in terms of Section 167(2) of the Code of Criminal
Procedure, 1973 and the date when the said charge-sheet
has been filed which would assist the learned Trial
Courts in preservation of the rights of personal liberties
of the accused appearing before them by informing the
accused on coming to know that an accused person
before them is entitled to the indefeasible right of default
bail and may thus exercise the same if he / she is willing
to furnish bail.”,
19.    Apparently, in the instant case as observed herein above,
the applicant is not entitled to the grant of default bail in as
much as the prayer seeking the grant of default bail or bail even
in terms of Section 439 of the Cr.P.C., 1973 had not been made
by the applicant prior to the impugned order declining bail.
BAIL APPLN. NO.2208/2022                                      Page 15 of 16
20.    Taking into account, thus the allegations levelled against
the applicant of his being involved allegedly as a co-director of
one of the Chinese companies through whom the information
falling   within   the   ambit  of secret/confidential/sensitive
documents material information was being conveyed by the co-
accused Rajeev Sharma to Chinese Intelligence Officers
allegedly and that there was a conveyance of documents
classified as “Confidential” being conveyed by the company of
which the petitioner/applicant herein was one of the co-
directors for which funding was received by the co-accused
Rajeev Sharma through the Shell company of which the
applicant herein was allegedly a co-director, in view of the
gravity of the offence affecting the national security of the
country, there is no ground for grant of bail and the bail
application is declined.
21.    It is, however, expected by this Court that the
observations of this Court in Arvind Kumar Saxena V. State; a
verdict dated 14.3.2018 in Bail Appln. No. 2238/2017 referred
to herein above vide paragraph 18 are expeditiously explored to
be implemented by the Registrar General of this Court.
