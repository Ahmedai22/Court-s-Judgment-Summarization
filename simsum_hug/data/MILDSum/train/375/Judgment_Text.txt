1.    The petitioner is before this Court seeking for the
following reliefs:
a. Quashing the impugned order dated 16.1.2014
passed by the President, Zilla panchayath, Mandya
District, Mandya in proceedings No.JiPanMan
Appeal NO.7/2002-03 vide Annexure-A and
consequently issue writ in the nature of certiorari
quashing the impugned order dated 7.3.2002 C5
vÁ¥ÀA.¥Àæ.¹Dgï.:83:2001-02 passed by the President,
WP No. 50646 of 2016
Nagamangala vide Annexure-L
b. Issue such other order or directions as this Hon’ble
Court deems fit to grant under the circumstances
of the case including costs, in the interest of justice
and equity.
2. The grievance of the petitioner is that the orders at
Annexure-A in Appeal No.7/2023 dated 16.1.2014
passed by the Zilla Panchayat at Annexure-A and the
order dated 7.03.2002 passed by the President,
Taluka     Panchayat      at   Annexure-L        are     without
jurisdiction inasmuch as neither of them have powers
under Section 237 of the Panchayat Raj Act, 1993 to
cancel the katha issued by the respondent No.4,
Nagamangala taluka panchayat in favour of the
father of the petitioner who had already deceased
prior to the order being passed.
3. The    contention     of   Sri.G.S.Venkata        Subba      Rao,
learned counsel for the petitioner is that there is no
such powers vested with the respondents under
Section 237 of the Act for cancellation of the katha.
If at all appropriate proceedings are to be taken
WP No. 50646 of 2016
under Section 269, which not having been done,
these powers could not have been exercised by the
authorities.   That apart, the delay which has been
caused in challenging the said order is on account of
no particular information being made available to the
petitioner about the next date the matter would be
taken inasmuch as on several occasions there was no
sitting of respondent No.2 and the petitioner did not
even know the next date, furthermore the order
passed     by   respondent   No.2     was  not   even
communicated to the petitioner. It is only when the
5th   respondent sought to assert his right on the
property that the petitioner came to know of the
claim made by respondent No.5 being under the
impugned order and thereafter certified copies were
obtained and above petition filed.
4. None appears for respondent No.5 though called
twice.      Hence,  the   matter   is  taken  up   for
consideration.
5. Sri.B.J.Somayaji, learned counsel for respondents
No.2 to 4 fairly submits that respondent No.2 to 4
did not have the power to pass Annexures-A and L.
Similar is the submission made by learned AGA for
respondent No.1.
6. A perusal of Section 267 indicates that powers vested
are only for the purpose of suspension of any
particular action pending enquiry relating thereto and
does not confer any power to cancel the khatha.
Neither respondent No.2 nor respondent No.3 could
have passed the impugned order. As such, the said
order would have to be set-aside.
7. This   Court   is   coming   across    several   revenue
proceedings in various jurisdictions where quasi
judicial authorities are not holding sittings in a proper
and required manner nor are the information being
made available to the litigants and the lawyers. This
is one more case in reference inasmuch as the
impugned order dated 16.01.2014 was not to the
knowledge of the petitioner until he made enquiries
WP No. 50646 of 2016
thereto and obtained certified copies in the year
8. The   proceedings    having     gone    on   before   2nd
respondent, as could be gathered from Anenxure-N
indicates  that  on   most    dates    the   matter  was
adjourned on the ground that 2nd respondent was
otherwise busy with administrative work.
9. A perusal of the order sheet at Annexure-N gives a
very sad situation where the matter listed on
10.05.2002,    was   adjourned     to   15.06.2002   and
thereafter to 18.02.2002, 17.08.2002, 19.09.2002,
since the Presiding Officer was otherwise busy.       On
9.09.2004    there   was   sitting    but   nothing  had
happened    and    the   matter     was    adjourned   to
8.04.2005, 28.05.2005 and 8.07.2005 when the
WP No. 50646 of 2016
matter was adjourned to 11.08.2005 since the
counsel was not present. On 11.08.2005 due to lack
of time, the matter was adjourned. On 15.04.2006
when the matter was listed both the counsel were
absent,   hence  adjourned   to  25.05.2006.      On
19.04.2007,   26.05.2007   matter   was    adjourned
because the Presiding Officer was otherwise busy.
On 26.05.2007 since the counsel was not present,
matter   was   adjourned  to   16.08.2007.      From
16.08.2007, the matter was listed on 22.09.2007,
WP No. 50646 of 2016
08.08.2013,     19.09.2013,    17.10.2013     and  was
adjourned as the Presiding Officer was otherwise
busy.
10. Finally, on 13.12.2013 noticing that the counsel was
not present, the matter was posted for orders and
thereafter order seems to have been passed on
11. A perusal of the above, would not indicate any
information having been conveyed to the petitioner
or his advocate about the adjournment.         On most
occasions, it is the Presiding Officer who is otherwise
busy and did not discharge his quasi judicial function.
When the petitioner was absent, matter was posted
WP No. 50646 of 2016
for orders. These administrative authorities are also
discharging quasi judicial functions.       It   is but
required that the administrative authorities give
equal, if not more prominence to quasi judicial
functions where the rights of the citizens are affected
like in this case when the order has been passed
without jurisdiction, but also without information to
citizen in the matter.
12. It is but required that suitable directions are issued
to the Principal Secretary, Department of Panchayat
Raj, Rural Development to institute appropriate
system     and   methodology   to  webhost    all  case
proceedings including the daily orders and judgments
on the relevant website of that particular authority in
a similar manner as done by this Court as also the
13. All details of the proceedings including the date on
which the matter is posted, the daily orders which
have    been   passed,  evidence    which   has    been
recorded, directions which have been issued, as also
WP No. 50646 of 2016
the final Judgment which has been passed would be
required to be uploaded on the relevant website.
Necessary arrangements to be made to inform the
litigants, as also advocates by SMS and/or e-mail,
wherever e-mail id is provided about the orders
passed like that done by this Court.
14. Whenever there is any adjournment which is made
by quasi judicial authority, detailed reasoning to be
given as to why the matter is being adjourned rather
than laconic statement that the Presiding Officer is
otherwise busy in administrative function. A suitable
monitoring system to be established by the Prl.
Secretary, Department of Rural development and
Panchayat Raj to monitor the progress of all quasi
judicial proceedings before the Authorities coming
under his jurisdiction.
15. Comprehensive report, detailed project plan, as also
detailed action taken report to be submitted within a
period of eight weeks from date of this order.
WP No. 50646 of 2016
16. Learned AGA is directed to bring to the notice of the
Prl. Secretary, Department of Rural development and
Panchayat Raj about the seriousness of the matter,
more so, in this particular matter where proceedings
were pending from 2002 to 2014 where more than
hundred    adjournments        have    been    granted    on
account of the Presiding Officer being otherwise busy
in administrative functions.
17. The Chief Secretary, Government of Karnataka is
also directed to explore the possibility of appointing
separate set of persons to deal with quasi judicial
functions    who    is   not     required    to   discharge
administrative    functions,     so   that   long   pending
matters can be completed at the earliest.
18. In this age when courts have also installed hybrid
hearings   through     video     conferencing,     the   Prl.
Secretary    to  explore     the   possibility  of   making
available   similar   facilities   at   all  quasi   judicial
authorities so as to enable easy access to justice to
the citizens of the country.            Assistance of the
WP No. 50646 of 2016
Secretary, E-governance Department to be taken in
regard to the directions issued.
19.   In view of the above, I pass the following:
i. The petition is allowed.
ii. The impugned order dated 16.01.2014 passed
by the 2nd respondent in Appeal No.7/2002-03
at Annexure-A and the impugned order dated
7.03.2002     passed      by   3rd  respondent   at
Annexure-L are hereby quashed.
iii. Liberty   is  however       reserved   to  the  5th
respondent to initiate such proceedings as may
be available strictly in accordance with law.
20.   Though the above petition is disposed of, relist on
17.04.2023 for filing compliance report as regards
the above directions.
