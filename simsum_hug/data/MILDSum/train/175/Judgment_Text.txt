This petition is filed by the petitioner accused
No.1. under Section 482 of Cr.P.C. for quashing the
criminal proceedings in C.C. No.11057/2015 pending
on   the   file of  VII  Additional Chief  Metropolitan
Magistrate, Bangalore, for the offences punishable
under Section 500 of IPC.
2. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioner
and respondent.
3. The case of petitioner is that the respondent
filed a private complaint under section 200 of Cr.P.C.
which was registered in PCR No.13515/2014 for the
offences     punishable under Sections 500, 501, 504,
505(2) read with Section 120-B of IPC. The learned
Magistrate, after recording the sworn statement of the
complainant, took cognizance against the petitioner
for the offence punishable under Section 500 of IPC,
which is under challenge.
4. The learned Senior Counsel appearing for the
petitioner has contended that the petitioner is the
President of Bowring Institute (for short 'Institute').
The respondent, an expelled member of the Institute,
committed ruckus in the premises by trespassing into
the Institute along with 150 people.       Therefore, a
complaint was filed against the respondent by the
petitioner which was registered as FIR against him for
the offences punishable under sections 506, 504,
120B, 143, 147, 119, 448, 323 of IPC. Charge sheet
also was filed against the respondent-complainant and
others. On the special general body meeting called for
by the petitioner, the petitioner sent a letter showing
some pictures, cartoons and the defamatory pictures
against the respondent which insulted the respondent
intentionally.  Therefore, the complaint came to be
filed against respondent-complainant, which is under
5. The learned Senior counsel for the petitioner
has further contended that the letter issued by the
petitioner will not attract the definition under Section
499 of IPC and there is      no intention to defame the
respondent-complainant. The petitioner sent a letter
to make the members of the Institute to understand
about the criminal case filed against the respondent
by the petitioner and the letter was within the
members of the Institute and it was not publicized.
Therefore, the ingredients of Section 499 of IPC will
not attract and it squarely falls under Exception-8 to
Section 499 of IPC. Therefore, the complaint is devoid
of merits and is liable to be quashed.
6. The learned Senior Counsel for the petitioner
also contended that the learned Magistrate has not
taken the cognizance of the complaint filed by the
respondent but posted the case for sworn statement,
which is against the law and even otherwise, there is
no application of mind while passing the order by the
learned    Magistrate.       Therefore,   the    criminal
proceeding     cannot   be   sustainable   against    the
petitioner. Hence, prayed for quashing the criminal
In support of his arguments, the learned counsel
for the petitioner has relied upon the judgment of this
Court and other High Courts.
7.     Per   contra,  learned   counsel   for   the
respondent-complainant has seriously objected the
petition and contended that the petitioner-accused
No.1 expelled the respondent-complainant from the
membership of the Institute, which was challenged by
the respondent before the Civil Court and obtained a
decree. The petitioner also filed an appeal before the
appellate court which was dismissed. Now the matter
is pending before the Hon'ble Supreme Court in
Special Leave Petition and the respondent is litigating
the case before the Court in a dignified manner.
8.   The learned counsel for respondent further
contended      that  the  petitioner  was    involved  in
mismanagement and misappropriation of funds of the
Institute to the tune of 1,43,00,000/-.       A Five Man
Committee was appointed to unearth the fraud where
the Committee       gave  a   report, which says that
misappropriation     and   mismanagement       has  been
proved.    The respondent also has filed a complaint
before the Registrar of Co-operative Societies which is
pending for adjudication.       The petitioner, with an
intention to tarnish the image of the respondent,
insulted him and made a defamatory statement in the
news    letter   against the    members    of   the club,
mentioning the same by cartoon picture, which is
marked as exhibit before the trial Court. On perusal
of the cartoon picture, it clearly reveals that the
petitioner-accused No.1 made a defamatory statement
against the respondent stating that the respondent is
conspiring against the petitioner and quarreled with
the petitioner.     Then police arrested respondent.
Later, the respondent-complainant begging pardon by
holding the legs of the petitioner-accused. Thereafter,
the petitioner-accused No.1 shown the picture that the
respondent-complainant standing inside the accused
box before the court, etc. which clearly reveals as to
how the petitioner defamed the respondent in the
news letter and therefore, it clearly attracts Section
499 of IPC and it will not fall under any exception to
provision to Section 499 of IPC. He further contended
that in respect of taking cognizance by the Magistrate,
the learned counsel for the respondent contended that
the Magistrate has followed the procedure as provided
under Section 200 of Cr.P.C. and after ordering to
register  the  PCR,    posted  the  matter   for  sworn
statement    and   thereafter,  the  Magistrate  issued
process under Section 204 of Cr.P.C. Therefore, there
is no flaw in the order of taking cognizance by the
Magistrate.   The respondent has very good case on
merit. Hence, prays dismissing the petition.
9.  Having heard the arguments of the learned
counsel for the parties, perused the records.
10.   The first contention taken by the learned
Senior counsel for the petitioner-accused NO.1 is that
the news letter is not published to the public and it is
within the members of the Institute and that the
petitioner has only mentioned the facts of the criminal
case registered against the respondent and therefore,
it cannot be considered as defamatory statement,
which falls under Exception 8 to Section 499 of Cr.P.C.
11.    For better understanding, Exception 8 to
Section 499 Cr.P.C. is referred as under:
"Exception 8 to Section 499:
Accusation preferred in good faith to
authorised person.â€”It is not defamation to
prefer in good faith an accusation against any
person to any of those who have lawful authority
over that person with respect to the subject-matter
of accusation."
12.   On this back ground, now, let me see the
news letter sent by the petitioner-accused No.1 which
reveals that the petitioner being the President of
Bowring Institute sent a letter on 09.05.2014 calling
the special general body meeting. In the said letter,
the petitioner has mentioned some cartoon pictures
along with the explanation of the pictures.               On
verifying the first cartoon picture, he is referring the
respondent along with other three persons who are
said to be the expelled members, conspiring to attack
the petitioner.     The second picture reveals that the
respondent hired mob carrying placards, shouting
abusive slogans and targeting a particular community.
The third cartoon picture reveals that the respondent
is showing the muscle power along with others and
assaulting the staff of the Institute. The fourth picture
indicates   that the    respondent    is preventing   the
guards. The fifth picture reveals that the respondent is
kneeling down holding the leg of the petitioner and
requesting for pardon and the petitioner accused is
standing with suit. The last cartoon picture reveals
that because of conspiracy and communal hatred, the
respondent is put in accused box of the Court and he
is standing in front of the Magistrate facing the
criminal trial.
13. On perusal of the pictures of the cartoon, it
is clear that the petitioner-accused No.1 with an
intention to tarnish the image of the respondent-
complainant has shown these cartoon pictures as good
as he has committed the robbery or dacoity or
heinous crimes in the Institute. Though the learned
Senior Counsel for the petitioner has contended that
these cartoon pictures are only to make the members
of the Institute better understanding of the criminal
case, but the contention of the learned senior counsel
cannot be acceptable because the members of the
Institute are educated people, business people and
professionals. Such being the case, there is no need
for  the   petitioner to  depict  the  picture of  the
respondent by showing the cartoon pictures to the
members of Institute, the members of the Institute
are not the small kids, who are not able to understand
the criminal case filed against the respondent by the
14. The back ground of the dispute between the
parties are that the petitioner-accused is said to be
involved in mismanagement and misappropriation of
the fund of Rs.1,43,00,000/- (One Crore and forty
three lakhs) which was unearthed by the enquiry
reports of the five man Committee and also the
Registrar of Co-operative Societies.     The same was
questioned by the respondent being a member of the
Institute and he protested against the petitioner for
safeguarding the interest of the Institute.    Hence, in
order to take revenge against the respondent, the
petitioner said to be expelled the respondent from the
membership of the Institute.     It is also an admitted
fact that the respondent has already obtained decree
against   the    petitioner  for  expelling   from   the
membership of the Institute and the appeal also
dismissed.   Now, the appeal filed before the Hon'ble
Supreme Court in SLP is pending.           Therefore, it
appears that the petitioner-accused made a complaint
against the respondent and a case was registered and
charge sheet has been filed, but in order to intimate
the members regarding calling of the meeting for
taking further course of action, the petitioner was not
required to make such a defamatory statement and
cartoon pictures in the news letter sent to the
members of the Institute by defaming the respondent.
The members cannot be considered as the members
of the inner house, but they are all the public figures
in   the  society  and  they   are   members    of  the
Institute/club.   Such being the case, sending the
defamatory    statement   and   the  cartoons   directly
insulting the respondent by way of such statement
attracts Section 499 of IPC and it is not sent in good
faith by the public authority in order to attract
Exception 8 to Section 499 of IPC.       Therefore, the
contention of the learned senior counsel for the
petitioner cannot be acceptable.
15.  The learned counsel for the petitioner has
relied upon the judgment of the Madras High Court in
case of BALAMURUGAN Vs. STATE, REP. BY THE
INSPECTOR OF POLICE AND OTHERS reported in
2021 SCC OnLine MAD 2086, wherein a news paper
published the cartoon of the District Collector, the
Superintendent of Police and the Chief Minister of
Tamil Nadu, wherein the Madras High Court held that
the paper publisher has published those cartoons in
order to show his angry against the non performance
of the government in protecting the victim of the
crime.   The Madras High Court has further held that
the intention of the petitioner therein in depicting the
people in such a form can be easily understood and he
wanted to express his grief that the authorities have
to be ashamed of themselves over the inability or
inaction in containing the demand of         exorbitant
interest by the money lenders. Therefore, the said
facts of the case is altogether different from the
present case on hand. Therefore, the said case is not
applicable to the case on hand and there is clear case
of defamation which falls under Section 499 of IPC.
16.      The   learned   Senior  Counsel   for   the
petitioner has further relied upon the other judgments
of this Court and they are not applicable to the
present case on hand.
17.    The next ground urged by the learned
counsel    for   the   petitioner  is  regarding    taking
cognizance     by   the   Magistrate  and   the   learned
Magistrate, without taking cognizance, has posted the
matter for sworn statement, which is bad in law. In
this regard, learned counsel for respondent has
objected and contended that there is no flaw in the
order of Magistrate. On perusal of Section 200 of
Cr.P.C., it reads as under:
200. Examination of complainant. A Magistrate
taking cognizance of an offence on complaint shall
examine upon oath the complainant and the
witnesses present, if any, and the substance of
such examination shall be reduced to writing and
shall be signed by the complainant and the
witnesses, and also by the Magistrate: Provided
that, when the complaint is made in writing, the
Magistrate need not examine the complainant and
(a) if a public servant acting or- purporting to act in
the discharge of his official duties or a Court has
made the complaint; or
(b) if the Magistrate makes over the case for
inquiry or trial to another Magistrate under section
192: Provided further that if the Magistrate makes
over the case to another Magistrate under section
192 after examining the complainant and the
witnesses, the latter Magistrate need not re-
examine them.
18. The Co-ordinate Bench of this Court, in the
case of V.M. GANGADHAR AND OTHERS VS. S.D.
No.5135/2014        and connected        matter decided on
28.05.2019)      has    observed      in  respect     of   taking
cognizance and posting the matter for issuing process.
It is clear from Section 200 Cr.P.C. that, if the
Magistrate wants to refer the complaint to the police
under Section 156(3) of Cr.P.C., he can refer the
complaint   without     taking   cognizance.     If   the
magistrate wants to take cognizance, he can take
cognizance and post the matter for recording the
sworn statement and issue process under Section 204
Cr.P.C., otherwise he can dismiss the complaint under
Section 203 Cr.P.C.     In this regard, on perusal of the
order sheet of the Magistrate which is noted as under:
"The complainant is present,
Perused, checked and registered as
Put up with order sheet and report as
to jurisdiction by 07.10.2014."
19.   Thereafter, the sworn statement of the
complainant was recorded and later, on 27.4.2015, an
order was passed mentioning the averments in the
complaint and thereafter held that there is prima facie
case to proceed against the accused only under
Section 500 of Cr.P.C.    and accordingly, ordered to
register criminal case and ordered to issue summons.
20. On perusal of the order dated 03.09.2014,
of course, the word 'cognizance' was not written by
the Magistrate, but the order of the Magistrate clearly
reveals that he has applied his mind in respect of the
private complaint and ordered to register the PCR and
posted the matter for recording sworn statement,
which clearly reveals that the Magistrate has taken
cognizance of the offence and thereafter, sworn
statement was recorded and the order was passed on
27.04.2015. The learned Magistrate has not used the
words 'cognizance taken on 27.4.2015 and issued
process'. If the learned Magistrate has not taken the
cognizance on 03.09.2014 and recorded the sworn
statement    and if   the cognizance was taken on
27.04.2015, he could have mentioned that cognizance
is taken against the accused on 27.04.2015, but no
such order is passed by the Magistrate on 27.04.2015.
Therefore, it is clear that, as per Section 200 Cr.P.C.,
the Magistrate has received the complaint, examined
the complainant by taking cognizance and postponed
the issuance of process and thereafter, he has issued
the process under Section 204 of Cr.P.C.       Therefore,
there is no flaw in the order passed by the Magistrate
in taking cognizance of the offence against the
petitioner. It is well settled that, even in the Code of
Criminal Procedure, there is no definition for the word
'cognizance'. It is only an application of mind by a
Judge.   Therefore, merely not mentioning about the
word 'cognizance', cannot be said that there is no
cognizance taken by the Magistrate.       Therefore, the
contention of the learned Senior Counsel for the
petitioner that taking cognizance by the Magistrate is
wrong, cannot be acceptable. On the other hand, the
learned Magistrate is right in taking cognizance and
thereafter,    the   sworn   statement    was   recorded.
Therefore, the petition is devoid of merit and liable to
be dismissed.
21. Accordingly, the petition is dismissed.
The matter is pending before the Court below for
the last seven years and the petitioner, for one or the
other reason, is dragging the matter. Therefore, the
trial Court is directed to dispose of the matter as early
as possible, within 4 months from the date of receipt
of the copy of this order.
