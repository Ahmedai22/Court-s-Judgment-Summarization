The Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court has again issued notice to Youtuber/Commentator for his remarks against the Indian Judiciary in a recent Youtube interview where he made the below remark:
"The entire higher judiciary is riddled with corruption"
When the matter came up before the bench of Justice GR Swaminathan and Justice B Pugalendhi today, the court issued notice to Savukku Shankar as to why proceedings for criminal contempt should not be taken against him.
The court also enquired as to the status of disciplinary proceedings against Savukku Shankar, who had been employed in the Directorate of Vigilance and Anti Corruption as ministerial staff. 
On July 19, Justice GR Swaminathan directed the Madurai bench registry to register a suo motu case of criminal contempt against Savukku Shankar for his tweets against the judge. Savukku Shankar had through his tweets alleged that the Judge had "met someone" in connection to the proceedings against another Youtuber Maridhas thus raising questions on the order passed by the judge which was in favor of Maridhas. Through his tweets, Mr. Shankar suggested that the Judge was influenced by the person whom he met when he quashed the criminal prosecution against Maridhas who was charged for tweeting against the DMK government in Tamil Nadu.
Case Title: Registrar Judicial v. Shankar @ Savukku Sankar and others 
Case No: Cont P(MD) 1124 of 2022
