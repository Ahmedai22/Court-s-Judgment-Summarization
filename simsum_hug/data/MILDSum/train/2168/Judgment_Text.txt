1. The order dated 31.05.2019 passed by the High Court of Punjab and Haryana
granting bail to Respondent Nos. 1 and 2 is assailed in this Appeal by the Serious
2. An investigation was directed to be conducted into the affairs of Adarsh Group
of Companies and LLPs by the Central Government in exercise of the powers
conferred under Section 212(1)(c) of the Companies Act, 2013 and subsections (2)
and (3)(c)(i) of Section 43 of the Limited Liability Partnership Act, 2008. Inspectors
were appointed by the Director, SFIO to carry out the investigation. Respondent
Nos. 1 and 2 were arrested pursuant to the approval granted by the Director, SFIO
on 10.12.2018. On 20.12.2018, the High Court of Delhi directed interim release of
Respondent Nos. 1 and 2 in Writ Petition (Criminal) Nos. 3842 of 2018 and 3843 of
2018. The order of the High Court was set aside by this Court on 27.03.2019,
following which Respondent Nos. 1 and 2 surrendered on 01.04.2019. Respondent
Nos. 1 and 2 were remanded to 14 days’ judicial custody on 05.04.2019. On
account of continuation of the investigation, the Special Court, Gurugram
extended the judicial custody of Respondent Nos. 1 and 2 to 16.05.2019. In the
meanwhile, Respondent Nos. 1 and 2 filed regular bail applications for being
released on bail before the High Court on 03.05.2019. The applications were
directed to be listed on 21.05.2019 by the High Court. The High Court further
directed the trial court to consider any application that may be filed by
Respondent Nos.1 and 2 under Section 167 of the Code of Criminal Procedure,
1973 (“CrPC”), in the meanwhile. On 16.05.2019, the Special Court extended the
judicial custody of Respondent Nos.1 and 2 till 30.05.2019.
3. Criminal complaint under Section 439(2) read with Section 212(15) of the
Companies Act, 2013 was filed before the Special Court, Gurugram on 18.05.2019.
The Special Court directed registration of the complaint and listed the matter on
24.05.2019 for considering summoning of the accused persons. Respondent Nos.
1 and 2 filed applications for statutory bail under Section 167(2) of the CrPC on
20.05.2019. The said applications were dismissed by the Sessions Judge,
Gurugram on 22.05.2019 on the ground that the complaint under Section 439(2)
of the Companies Act, 2013 was filed on 18.05.2019, i.e., before the expiry of the
60-day period prescribed in proviso (a) to Section 167(2) of the CrPC. The High
Court considered the regular bail applications filed by Respondent Nos. 1 and 2 on
31.05.2019 and directed their release on bail on the ground that they were
entitled to statutory bail. The sole reason given for grant of bail by the High Court
is that the trial court has not taken cognizance of the complaint before the expiry
of the 60-day period, which entitled Respondent Nos. 1 and 2 to statutory bail, as
a matter of indefeasible right.
4. We have heard Mr. Aman Lekhi, learned Additional Solicitor General appearing
on behalf of the Appellant, Mr. Vikram Choudhri, learned Senior Counsel
appearing on behalf of Respondent Nos.1 and 2 and Mr. Mukul Rohatgi, learned
Senior Counsel for the Intervenor. The learned ASG submitted that the High Court
committed a serious error in granting statutory bail to Respondent Nos. 1 and 2, in
spite of the fact that the complaint was filed well before the expiry of 60 days
from the date of the remand. An egregious error has been committed by the High
Court in holding that cognizance also has to be taken before the expiry of the
60-day period, or else, the accused would be entitled to statutory bail under
Section 167(2), CrPC. He stated that the mischief that is sought to be addressed
under Section 167(2) is failure to complete the investigation. According to the
scheme of the CrPC, on completion of investigation, the final report/complaint is
filed under Section 173(2), CrPC. Statutory bail under Section 167(2), CrPC can be
granted only in a case where investigation is not complete within the prescribed
period and not otherwise. He submitted that the judgment of the High Court is
contrary to the law laid down by this Court in Suresh Kumar Bhikamchand Jain v.
State of Maharashtra & Anr., (2013) 3 SCC 77.
5. It was argued on behalf of Respondent Nos. 1 and 2 that the High Court was
justified in granting statutory bail to them as, admittedly, cognizance was not
taken before the expiry of the 60-day period. Placing reliance on a judgment of
this Court in Sanjay Dutt v. State, (1994) 5 SCC 410. Mr. Chaudhri argued that the
maximum period of detention that the accused can be remanded to under Section
167, CrPC is 60 days, beyond which detention can be extended only if the accused
is unable to furnish bail. He submitted that this Court in Mohamed Iqbal Madar
Sheikh & Ors. v. State of Maharashtra, (1996) 1 SCC 722 explained the judgment
in Sanjay Dutt (supra) and held that the right under Section 167(2), CrPC cannot
be exercised after the charge-sheet has been submitted and cognizance has been
taken. It was further argued that an accused has a right to seek statutory bail
under the proviso to Section 167(2) even after the chargesheet is filed, till the
court takes cognizance.
6. An application for intervention was filed by Rahul Kothari. The Intervenor filed
an application for statutory bail which was rejected by the trial court and upheld
by the High Court. Special Leave Petition (Criminal) Diary No. 12089 of 2021 filed
by him is pending consideration of this Court. As the issue raised for consideration
in the said special leave petition is the same that arises in the present Appeals, the
Intervenor has sought permission to participate and make submissions. Mr. Mukul
Rohatgi, learned Senior Counsel appearing for the Intervenor, submitted that
there is a conflict of opinion regarding the interpretation of Section 167(2), CrPC.
According to him, this Court in Madar Sheikh (supra) has taken a view that an
accused can invoke his right for statutory bail if the court has not taken cognizance
of the complaint before the expiry of the statutory period from the date of
remand. This Court in Bhikamchand Jain (supra) has taken a different view
without referring to the judgment of this Court in Madar Sheikh (supra). Mr.
Rohatgi submitted that this Court in M. Ravindran v. Intelligence Officer,
Directorate of Revenue Intelligence4 took the same view as that of this Court in
Madar Sheikh (supra), without reference to the judgment in Bhikamchand Jain
(supra). He relied upon an order of this Court dated 23.02.2021 passed in Criminal
Appeal Nos. 701-702 of 2020 by which another Division Bench of this Court
referred a similar issue to a larger bench. He further placed reliance upon another
order dated 12.03.2021 of this Court by which two other special leave petitions
have been tagged on with Criminal Appeal Nos. 701-702 of 2020, which were
referred 4 (2021) 2 SCC 485 to a larger bench. He submitted that Special Leave
Petition (Criminal) Nos. 2111-2112 of 2021, which were subject-matter of the
order dated 12.03.2021, raise the same issue that falls for consideration in these
Appeals, i.e., the right of an accused to claim statutory bail in case cognizance is
not taken before the expiry of the prescribed period of 60 or 90 days, as the case
may be. To settle the conflicting opinions of this Court, it is imminently necessary
to refer this matter to a larger bench, according to Mr. Rohatgi.
7. Respondent Nos. 1 and 2 are the directors of Adarsh Group of Companies and
LLPs, who were accused of committing an offence under Section 447 of the
Companies Act, 2013, Section 120-B read with Sections 417, 418, 420, 406, 463,
467, 468, 471, 474 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 (“IPC”). The undisputed facts
are that the complaint under Section 439(2) of the Companies Act, 2013 was filed
on 18.05.2019, which was before the expiry of the 60-day period from the date of
the remand. The applications filed for statutory bail were dismissed by the Special
Court on 22.05.2019, on the ground that the charge-sheet was filed before the
expiry of 60 days. Respondent Nos. 1 and 2 did not argue before the Special Court
that they were entitled for statutory bail, even after filing of the charge-sheet
before the expiry of the 60-day period, as cognizance had not been taken. The trial
court disposed of the applications for statutory bail, on being so directed by an
order dated 10.05.2019 passed by the High Court in regular bail applications filed
by Respondent Nos. 1 and 2. The said regular bail applications were taken up for
hearing by the High Court and by the impugned order, bail was granted to
Respondent Nos. 1 and 2 on the ground that cognizance had not been taken by
the court before the expiry of 60 days. However, while doing so, the High Court
failed to consider the order dated 22.05.2019 passed by the trial court dismissing
the applications seeking statutory bail.
8. The only point that arises for our consideration in this case is whether an
accused is entitled for statutory bail under Section 167(2), CrPC on the ground
that cognizance has not been taken before the expiry of 60 days or 90 days, as the
case may be, from the date of remand. Section 167(2), CrPC reads as below:
167. Procedure when investigation cannot be completed in twenty-four
hours.
(2) The Magistrate to whom an accused person is forwarded under this
section may, whether he has or has not jurisdiction to try the case, from
time to time, authorise the detention of the accused in such custody as
such Magistrate thinks fit, for a term not exceeding fifteen days in the
whole; and if he has no jurisdiction to try the case or commit it for trial, and
considers further detention unnecessary, he may order the accused to be
(a) the Magistrate may authorise the detention of the accused person,
otherwise than in custody of the police, beyond the period of fifteen days, if
he is satisfied that adequate grounds exist for doing so, but no Magistrate
shall authorise the detention of the accused person in custody under this
(i) ninety days, where the investigation relates to an offence punishable
with death, imprisonment for life or imprisonment for a term of not less
(ii) sixty days, where the investigation relates to any other offence, and, on
the expiry of the said period of ninety days, or sixty days, as the case may
be, the accused person shall be released on bail if he is prepared to and
does furnish bail, and every person released on bail under this subsection
shall be deemed to be so released under the provisions of Chapter XXXIII for
(b) no Magistrate shall authorise detention of the accused in custody of the
police under this section unless the accused is produced before him in
person for the first time and subsequently every time till the accused
remains in the custody of the police, but the Magistrate may extend further
detention in judicial custody on production of the accused either in person
(c) no Magistrate of the second class, not specially empowered in this
behalf by the High Court, shall authorise detention in the custody of the
police.
Explanation I.—For the avoidance of doubts, it is hereby declared that,
notwithstanding the expiry of the period specified in paragraph (a), the
accused shall be detained in custody so long as he does not furnish bail.
Explanation II.— If any question arises whether an accused person was
produced before the Magistrate as required under clause (b), the
production of the accused person may be proved by his signature on the
order authorising detention or by the order certified by the Magistrate as to
production of the accused person through the medium of electronic video
linkage, as the case may be.
9. The issue is squarely covered by a judgment of this Court in Bhikamchand Jain
(supra), as contended by the Appellant. It is necessary to closely examine the
judgment passed in Bhikamchand Jain (supra). The petitioner in the said case was
arrested on 11.03.2012 on the allegation of misappropriation of amounts meant
for development of slums in Jalgaon City. The petitioner therein was accused of
committing offences punishable under Sections 120-B, 409, 411, 406, 408, 465,
466, 468, 471, 177 and 109 read with Section 34, IPC and also under Sections
13(1)(c), 13(1)(d) and 13(2) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988. The
contention of the petitioner therein was that he could not have been remanded to
custody in view of cognizance not being taken for want of sanction within the
statutory period of 90 days. The scheme of the provisions relating to remand of an
accused first during the stage of investigation and thereafter, after cognizance is
taken, indicates that the legislature intended investigation of certain crimes to be
completed within the period prescribed therein, according to this Court in
Bhikamchand Jain (supra). This Court held that in the event of investigation not
being completed by the investigating authorities within the prescribed period, the
accused acquires an indefeasible right to be granted bail, if he offers to furnish
bail. This Court was of the firm opinion that if on either the 61st day or the 91st
day, an accused makes an application for being released on bail in default of
charge-sheet having been filed, the court has no option but to release the accused
on bail. However, once the chargesheet was filed within the stipulated period, the
right of the accused to statutory bail came to an end and the accused would be
entitled to pray for regular bail on merits. It was held by this Court that the filing
of charge-sheet is sufficient compliance with the provisions of proviso (a) to
Section 167(2), CrPC and that taking of cognizance is not material to Section 167.
The scheme of CrPC is such that once the investigation stage is completed, the
court proceeds to the next stage, which is the taking of cognizance and trial.
During the period of investigation, the accused is under the custody of the
Magistrate before whom he or she is first produced, with such Magistrate being
vested with power to remand the accused to police custody and/or judicial
custody, up to a maximum period as prescribed under Section 167(2).
Acknowledging the fact that an accused has to remain in custody of some court,
this Court concluded that on filing of the charge-sheet within the stipulated
period, the accused continues to remain in the custody of the Magistrate till such
time as cognizance is taken by the court trying the offence, when the said court
assumes custody of the accused for purposes of remand during the trial in terms
of Section 309, CrPC. This Court clarified that the two stages are different, with
one following the other so as to maintain continuity of the custody of the accused
with a court.
10. It is clear from the judgment of this Court in Bhikamchand Jain (supra) that
filing of a charge-sheet is sufficient compliance with the provisions of Section 167,
CrPC and that an accused cannot demand release on default bail under Section
167(2) on the ground that cognizance has not been taken before the expiry of 60
days. The accused continues to be in the custody of the Magistrate till such time
cognizance is taken by the court trying the offence, which assumes custody of the
accused for the purpose of remand after cognizance is taken. The conclusion of
the High Court that the accused cannot be remanded beyond the period of 60
days under Section 167 and that further remand could only be at the
post-cognizance stage, is not correct in view of the judgment of this Court in
11. The point that requires to be considered is whether this Court has taken a
different view in Sanjay Dutt (supra), Madar Sheikh (supra) and M. Ravindran
(supra). In Sanjay Dutt (supra), this Court held that the indefeasible right accruing
to the accused is enforceable only prior to the filing of challan and it does not
survive or remain enforceable, on the challan being filed. It was made clear that
once the challan has been filed, the question of grant of bail has to be considered
and decided only with reference to the merits of the case under the provisions
relating to grant of bail to an accused after the filing of the challan. In light of the
above findings, this Court held that the custody of the accused after the challan
has been filed is not governed by Section 167(2) but different provisions of the
12. In Madar Sheikh (supra), which was relied upon by the learned Senior Counsel
appearing for Respondent Nos. 1 and 2 and the Intervenor, the appellants therein
were taken into custody on 16.01.1993. The charge-sheet was submitted on
30.08.1993. Though the appellants were entitled to be released in view of the
charge-sheet not being filed within the statutory period prescribed under Section
20(4)(b) of the Terrorist and Disruptive Activities (Prevention) Act, 1987 read with
proviso (a) to Section 167(2), CrPC, they did not make an application for release on
bail on the ground of default in completion of the investigation within the
statutory period. After filing of the charge-sheet and cognizance having been
taken, they continued to be in custody on the basis of orders of remand passed
under other provisions of the CrPC. Refusing to grant relief of statutory bail in the
said fact situation, this Court held that the right conferred on an accused under
Section 167(2) cannot be exercised after the charge-sheet has been submitted and
cognizance has been taken. A plain reading of the judgment in Madar Sheikh
(supra) would show that reference to the right of statutory bail becoming
unenforceable after cognizance having been taken is in view of the facts of the
said case, where this Court denied statutory bail to the appellants therein on the
ground that charge-sheet was filed and cognizance had also been taken, with
orders of remand passed under other provisions of the CrPC. Thereafter, they
were not entitled for bail under Section 167(2).
13. Application for bail under Section 167(2), CrPC fell for consideration of this
Court in M. Ravindran (supra). In the said case, the appellant was arrested and
remanded to judicial custody on 04.08.2018 for offences punishable under the
Narcotics Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985. On 01.02.2019, the
appellant therein filed an application for bail under Section 167(2) on the ground
that investigation was not complete and charge-sheet had not been filed within
the statutory period. The trial court granted bail under Section 167(2), which was
set aside by the High Court of Madras by judgment dated 21.11.2019. Challenging
the said judgment of the High Court, the appellant approached this Court. The
crucial fact in the said case is that the appellant therein filed an application on
01.02.2019 at 10.30 a.m.before the trial court and on the same day at 4.25 p.m.,
an additional complaint was filed against the appellant, on the basis of which
dismissal of the bail application was sought. This Court restored the order of the
trial court while setting aside the judgment of the High Court, by holding that the
accused is deemed to have “availed of” or enforced his right to be released on
default bail, once application for bail has been filed under Section 167(2) on expiry
of the stipulated time period. Taking into account the fact that before the expiry of
180 days, no charge-sheet had been submitted nor any application filed seeking
extension of time to investigate, this Court held that the appellant was entitled to
be released on statutory bail notwithstanding the subsequent filing of an
additional complaint. The point that was decided in the said case was that the
filing of an additional complaint after the accused has availed his right to be
released on default bail, should not deter the courts from enforcing this
indefeasible right, if the charge-sheet was not filed before the expiry of the
statutory period. Reference was made by this Court to Madar Sheikh (supra) in M.
Ravindran (supra). This Court observed that no prior application for bail was filed
in Madar Sheikh (supra) though the charge-sheet was submitted after the expiry
of the statutory period. This Court repeated the findings recorded in Madar
Sheikh (supra) that the right to bail cannot be exercised once the charge-sheet has
been submitted and cognizance has been taken. As stated above, the said
conclusion in Madar Sheikh (supra) was arrived at with reference to the facts of
the case.
14. The issue that arose for consideration before this Court in Criminal Appeal
Nos. 701-702 of 2020 relates to whether the date of remand is to be included in
computation of the period of 60 days or 90 days, as contemplated under proviso
(a) to Section 167(2), for considering the claim for default bail. Taking note of the
divergence of opinions on the said point, this Court felt the need for consideration
of the issue by a larger bench. The later order dated 12.03.2021 passed in SLP
(Crl.) Nos. 2105-2106 of 2021 and SLP (Crl.) Nos. 2111-2112 of 2021 is for tagging
all those matters along with Criminal Appeal Nos. 701-702 of 2020. The
submission made on behalf of the petitioners therein and recorded in the said
order relates to the filing of a charge-sheet on the last day without a list of
witnesses and documents not amounting to a proper filing of charge-sheet. Mr.
Rohatgi referred to the SLP (Crl.) No. 2111-2112 of 2021 and submitted that one
of the points raised relates to cognizance being taken before the expiry of the
statutory period under Section 167, CrPC. It is clear that a reference to a larger
bench pertains to the issue of exclusion or inclusion of the date of remand for
computation of the period prescribed under Section 167. Therefore, there is no
requirement for referring this case to a larger bench.
15. A close scrutiny of the judgments in Sanjay Dutt (supra), Madar Sheikh (supra)
and M. Ravindran (supra) would show that there is nothing contrary to what has
been decided in Bhikamchand Jain (supra). In all the above judgments which are
relied upon by either side, this Court had categorically laid down that the
indefeasible right of an accused to seek statutory bail under Section 167(2), CrPC
arises only if the charge-sheet has not been filed before the expiry of the statutory
period. Reference to cognizance in Madar Sheikh (supra) is in view of the fact
situation where the application was filed after the charge-sheet was submitted
and cognizance had been taken by the trial court. Such reference cannot be
construed as this Court introducing an additional requirement of cognizance
having to be taken within the period prescribed under proviso (a) to Section
167(2), CrPC, failing which the accused would be entitled to default bail, even
after filing of the charge-sheet within the statutory period. It is not necessary to
repeat that in both Madar Sheikh (supra) and M. Ravindran (supra), this Court
expressed its view that non-filing of the charge-sheet within the statutory period
is the ground for availing the indefeasible right to claim bail under Section 167(2),
CrPC. The conundrum relating to the custody of the accused after the expiry of 60
days has also been dealt with by this Court in Bhikamchand Jain (supra). It was
made clear that the accused remains in custody of the Magistrate till cognizance is
taken by the relevant court. As the issue that arises for consideration in this case is
squarely covered by the judgment in Bhikamchand Jain (supra), the order passed
by the High Court on 31.05.2019 is hereby set aside.
16. For the aforementioned reasons, the Appeals are allowed.
