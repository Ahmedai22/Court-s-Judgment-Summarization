1.          Feeling aggrieved and dissatisfied with the impugned judgment
and order dated 16.01.2014 passed by the High Court of Judicature at
Allahabad in Government Appeal No. 2895 of 1982, by which the High
Court has allowed the said appeal preferred by the State and has
reversed the judgment and order of acquittal passed by the learned trial
Court acquitting the accused for the offences punishable under Section
302 r/w 34 of the IPC and consequently has convicted the appellant –
original accused no.4 for the aforesaid offences, the original accused
no.4 has preferred the present appeal.
2.    That as per the case of the prosecution the deceased was the
Pradhan of the village for more than two decades. The accused were
having grudge against him.      On 6.10.1981 at about 7:00 a.m., the
deceased was going, as usual, to attend the call of nature towards the
bank of river Yamuna situated near his village. When the deceased
reached near Basic School, Nagarwar, all the four accused suddenly
emerged out from the Bajra field of Ram Sajiwan. Accused Murlidhar
Pathak and Gurudutt Pathak were armed with lathis, Dharmraj Pathak
was armed with spear and Ramraj Pathak was armed with pistol. The
deceased was attacked by the accused with spear and lathis.        The
deceased fell down on earth. They crushed his head with lathis. On hue
and cry, first informant Satrughan Pathak, his brother Ramsukh Pathak,
Lalmani Pathak and Shiv Shankar, who were already there at a short
distance, rushed towards the deceased whereupon accused Ramraj
Pathak fired a shot from his pistol towards the deceased and all the
assailants ran away along with their weapons. The deceased received
his instantaneous death at the spot.
2.1   Satrughan Pathak, son of the deceased, lodged an FIR against all
the accused persons for the offences punishable under Section 302 r/w
34 IPC.      The FIR was investigated by one Sukhram Sonkar, the
Investigating Officer. He recorded the statements of the witnesses. He
prepared the Panchnama at the spot.            He arrested the accused
Murlidhar Pathak on 07.10.1981 at about 4:00 a.m. after a little chase
and during the course of his arrest police personnel inflicted injuries at
his person near bridge of river Fagawa.
2.2   Dr. Nisar Ahmad conducted the post-mortem.           He noticed the
following ante-mortem injuries on the body of the deceased:
i)    Depressed fracture of skull with fracture of left parietal bone.
In fact all the bones were broken. Brain matter had been liquefied.
ii)   Multiple abrasion on left pinna.
iii)  Incised wound over the scalp 5 inch above ear T.U. directed,
2 inch x 2 inch. Brain matter going out.
iv)   Lacerated wound above the occipital, 2 inch x 2 inch. Brain
matter going out.
v)    Incised wound over the left occiput, 2 inch x 1 inch.
vi)   Incised wound over lateral aspect of palm, 1 inch x 1 inch x
muscle deep.
vii)  Lacerated wound on the posterior aspect of skull, 1 inch x 1
inch x muscle deep.
viii) Incised wound over the proximal of the occipital.
ix)   Incised wound over the left parietal bone, 1 inch x 1 inch x
brain cavity deep with brain matter going out.
x)    Incised wound over the parietal bone, 1 inch x 1 inch. Brain
matter was going out.
xi)   Incised wound over the frontal bone, 1 inch x 1 inch. Brain
matter going out.
As per the post-mortem report, the cause of the death was due to
shock and haemorrhage as a result of the aforesaid injuries.
2.3   On completion of the investigation, the Investigating Officer filed
the chargesheet against Murlidhar Pathak and three absconded
accused. That after the remaining persons came to be arrested, as the
case was triable exclusively by the Court of Sessions, the learned Chief
Judicial Magistrate committed the case to the Court of Sessions. All the
accused were charged for the offences punishable under Section 302/34
IPC for the murder of the deceased-Ram Aasare Pathak.             All the
accused denied the charges and therefore they came to be tried for the
aforesaid offences.
2.4   To prove the case, the prosecution examined as many as eight
witnesses. PW2 and PW4 were the eyewitnesses and PW7 was the
Investigating Officer.  At the end of the trial, the learned trial Court
acquitted all the accused persons mainly on the grounds that PW1 to
PW4 – eyewitnesses were related and interested witnesses; no
independent witness has been examined; PW2 and PW4, sons of the
deceased may be termed as chance witnesses; place of occurrence is
not proved by the prosecution and there was no occasion for the
deceased to reach at the alleged spot; absence of fire injuries at the
person of the deceased; and prosecution has not explained the injuries
on the accused Murlidhar Pathak.
3.    Feeling aggrieved and dissatisfied with the order of acquittal
passed by the learned trial Court, the State preferred appeal before the
High Court. During the pendency of the appeal, accused nos. 1 to 3
died/expired and therefore the appeal against the appellant herein –
original accused no.4 was proceeded further. That on re-appreciation of
the entire evidence on record, by the impugned judgment and order, the
High Court has allowed the appeal and has set aside the order of
acquittal passed by the learned trial Court and consequently has
convicted the appellant herein – original accused no.4 for the offences
under Section 302/34 IPC and has sentenced him to undergo life
imprisonment.
4.    Feeling aggrieved and dissatisfied by the impugned judgment and
order passed by the High Court reversing the order of acquittal and
convicting the appellant – original accused no.4 for the offences under
Section 302/34 IPC, original accused no.4 has preferred the present
appeal.
5.     Learned Advocate appearing on behalf of the appellant has made
i)     that the High Court has exceeded in its jurisdiction in reversing the
well-reasoned judgment and order of acquittal passed by the learned
trial Court and consequently convicting the accused;
ii)    that the learned trial Court, as such, committed no error in
iii)   that the motive has not been established and proved;
iv)    that all the prosecution witnesses – so called eyewitnesses – PW1
to PW4 are all related and interested witnesses;
v)     that no independent witness has been examined;
vi)    that as rightly observed by the learned trial Court, PW2 & PW4 are
vii)   that from the medical evidence there is no injury found from the
fired arm and therefore it disproves the case of the prosecution;
viii)  that the prosecution has failed to explain the injury on one of the
ix)    that the medical evidence does not support the case of the
xi)    that the prosecution has failed to prove the exact place of the
occurrence of the incident.
5.1    Learned counsel appearing on behalf of the appellant has
submitted that as per catena of decisions of this Court when two views
are possible and an order of acquittal passed by the learned trial Court is
based on appreciation of evidence on record, the High Court shall not
interfere with such an order of acquittal.     It is submitted that in the
present case the High Court has reversed the order of acquittal in an
appeal     under    Section  378    Cr.P.C.   and    has   exercised   the
powers/jurisdiction beyond the scope of Section 378 Cr.P.C.
5.2    Making the above submissions, it is prayed to allow the present
appeal and set aside the impugned judgment and order passed by the
High Court and restore the well-reasoned judgment and order of
acquittal passed by the learned trial Court.
6.     The present appeal is vehemently opposed by the learned
Standing Counsel appearing on behalf of the respondent – State of Uttar
Learned counsel appearing on behalf of the State has vehemently
submitted that in the facts and circumstances of the case, the High Court
has not committed any error in reversing the judgment and order of
acquittal and consequently convicting the accused.
6.1    It is submitted that being the first appellate court against the
judgment and order of acquittal passed by the learned trial Court, the
High Court is justified in reappreciating the entire evidence on record
and coming to its conclusion. Reliance is placed on the decision of this
Court in the case of Umedbhai Jadavbhai v. State of Gujarat (1978) 1
6.2    It is submitted that by the impugned judgment and order the High
Court has considered in detail the grounds on which the learned trial
Court acquitted the accused and having found that the grounds on which
the accused have been acquitted are not tenable at law and are just
contrary to the evidence on record and are perverse, the High Court has
rightly convicted the accused.
6.3    It is further submitted that in the present case the prosecution has
established and proved the actual place of incident/occurrence and has
explained the injuries on one of the accused – Murlidhar Pathak.
6.4    It is submitted that even in the 313 statement, the appellant –
original accused no.4 has also stated about the enmity. It is submitted
that therefore even according to the appellant – original accused no.4,
there was an enmity between the deceased and the accused.
6.5    It is further submitted that one of the grounds on which the learned
trial Court acquitted the accused was that no independent witness has
been examined.         It is submitted that when the witnesses who are
examined are found to be reliable and trustworthy, mere non-
examination of the independent witnesses shall not be fatal to the case
of the prosecution.
6.6    It is further submitted that one another reason given by the learned
trial Court which has been elaborately dealt with by the High Court was
that neither there was any firearm injury nor the firearm was recovered.
It is submitted that in the deposition of the eyewitnesses it has come on
record that as per the case of the prosecution there was a fire shot but it
was in air and no injury was sustained by the firearm.
6.7   It is submitted that in the present case the eyewitnesses PW2 &
PW4 have fully supported the case of the prosecution and therefore the
High Court has rightly convicted the accused.
7.    We have heard the learned counsel for the respective parties at
length. We have gone through and considered in detail the judgment
and order of acquittal passed by the learned trial Court as well as the
impugned judgment and order passed by the High Court reversing the
acquittal and convicting the accused, to satisfy ourselves whether in the
facts and circumstances of the case, the High Court is justified in
reversing the judgment and order of acquittal passed by the learned trial
Court and consequently convicting the accused.
7.1   We are conscious of the fact that this is a case of reversal of
acquittal by the High Court. Therefore, the first and foremost thing which
is required to be considered is, whether in the facts and circumstances
of the case, the High Court is justified in interfering with the order of
7.2   In the case of Babu v. State of Kerala (2010) 9 SCC 189, this Court
has reiterated the principles to be followed in an appeal against acquittal
under Section 378 Cr.P.C. In paragraphs 12 to 19, it is observed and
“12. This Court time and again has laid down the guidelines for the High
Court to interfere with the judgment and order of acquittal passed by the
trial court. The appellate court should not ordinarily set aside a judgment of
acquittal in a case where two views are possible, though the view of the
appellate court may be the more probable one. While dealing with a
judgment of acquittal, the appellate court has to consider the entire
evidence on record, so as to arrive at a finding as to whether the views of
the trial court were perverse or otherwise unsustainable. The appellate
court is entitled to consider whether in arriving at a finding of fact, the trial
court had failed to take into consideration admissible evidence and/or had
taken into consideration the evidence brought on record contrary to law.
Similarly, wrong placing of burden of proof may also be a subject-matter of
scrutiny by the appellate court. (Vide Balak Ram v. State of U.P (1975) 3
SCC 219, Shambhoo Missir v. State of Bihar (1990) 4 SCC 17, Shailendra
Pratap v. State of U.P (2003) 1 SCC 761, Narendra Singh v. State of M.P
(2004) 10 SCC 699, Budh Singh v. State of U.P (2006) 9 SCC 731, State
of U.P. v. Ram Veer Singh (2007) 13 SCC 102, S. Rama Krishna v. S.
Rami Reddy (2008) 5 SCC 535, Arulvelu v. State (2009) 10 SCC 206,
Perla Somasekhara Reddy v. State of A.P (2009) 16 SCC 98 and Ram
13. In Sheo Swarup v. King Emperor AIR 1934 PC 227, the Privy Council
“… the High Court should and will always give proper weight and
consideration to such matters as (1) the views of the trial Judge as to the
credibility of the witnesses; (2) the presumption of innocence in favour of
the accused, a presumption certainly not weakened by the fact that he has
been acquitted at his trial; (3) the right of the accused to the benefit of any
doubt; and (4) the slowness of an appellate court in disturbing a finding of
fact arrived at by a Judge who had the advantage of seeing the
witnesses.”
14. The aforesaid principle of law has consistently been followed by this
Court. (See Tulsiram Kanu v. State AIR 1954 SC 1, Balbir Singh v. State of
Punjab AIR 1957 SC 216, M.G. Agarwal v. State of Maharashtra AIR 1963
SC 200, Khedu Mohton v. State of Bihar (1970) 2 SCC 450, Sambasivan
v. State of Kerala (1998) 5 SCC 412, Bhagwan Singh v. State of
M.P(2002) 4 SCC 85 and State of Goa v. Sanjay Thakran (2007) 3 SCC
15. In Chandrappa v. State of Karnataka (2007) 4 SCC 415, this Court
reiterated the legal position as under: (SCC p. 432, para 42)
“(1) An appellate court has full power to review, reappreciate and
reconsider the evidence upon which the order of acquittal is founded.
(2) The Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 puts no limitation, restriction or
condition on exercise of such power and an appellate court on the
evidence before it may reach its own conclusion, both on questions of fact
and of law.
(3) Various expressions, such as, ‘substantial and compelling reasons’,
‘good and sufficient grounds’, ‘very strong circumstances’, ‘distorted
conclusions’, ‘glaring mistakes’, etc. are not intended to curtail extensive
powers of an appellate court in an appeal against acquittal. Such
phraseologies are more in the nature of ‘flourishes of language’ to
emphasise the reluctance of an appellate court to interfere with acquittal
than to curtail the power of the court to review the evidence and to come
to its own conclusion.
(4) An appellate court, however, must bear in mind that in case of
acquittal, there is double presumption in favour of the accused. Firstly, the
presumption of innocence is available to him under the fundamental
principle of criminal jurisprudence that every person shall be presumed to
be innocent unless he is proved guilty by a competent court of law.
Secondly, the accused having secured his acquittal, the presumption of
his innocence is further reinforced, reaffirmed and strengthened by the trial
court.
(5) If two reasonable conclusions are possible on the basis of the evidence
on record, the appellate court should not disturb the finding of acquittal
recorded by the trial court.”
16. In Ghurey Lal v. State of U.P (2008) 10 SCC 450, this Court reiterated
the said view, observing that the appellate court in dealing with the cases
in which the trial courts have acquitted the accused, should bear in mind
that the trial court’s acquittal bolsters the presumption that he is innocent.
The appellate court must give due weight and consideration to the
decision of the trial court as the trial court had the distinct advantage of
watching the demeanour of the witnesses, and was in a better position to
evaluate the credibility of the witnesses.
17. In State of Rajasthan v. Naresh (2009) 9 SCC 368, the Court again
examined the earlier judgments of this Court and laid down that: (SCC p.
“20. … an order of acquittal should not be lightly interfered with even if the
court believes that there is some evidence pointing out the finger towards
the accused.”
18. In State of U.P. v. Banne (2009) 4 SCC 271, this Court gave certain
illustrative circumstances in which the Court would be justified in
interfering with a judgment of acquittal by the High Court. The
“(i) The High Court’s decision is based on totally erroneous view of law by
(ii) The High Court’s conclusions are contrary to evidence and documents
(iii) The entire approach of the High Court in dealing with the evidence was
patently illegal leading to grave miscarriage of justice;
(iv) The High Court’s judgment is manifestly unjust and unreasonable
based on erroneous law and facts on the record of the case;
(v) This Court must always give proper weight and consideration to the
(vi) This Court would be extremely reluctant in interfering with a case when
both the Sessions Court and the High Court have recorded an order of
acquittal.”
A similar view has been reiterated by this Court in Dhanapal v. State
19. Thus, the law on the issue can be summarised to the effect that in
exceptional cases where there are compelling circumstances, and the
judgment under appeal is found to be perverse, the appellate court can
interfere with the order of acquittal. The appellate court should bear in
mind the presumption of innocence of the accused and further that the trial
court’s acquittal bolsters the presumption of his innocence. Interference in
a routine manner where the other view is possible should be avoided,
unless there are good reasons for interference.”
7.2.1          When the findings of fact recorded by a court can be held to
be perverse has been dealt with and considered in paragraph 20 of the
“20. The findings of fact recorded by a court can be held to be perverse if
the findings have been arrived at by ignoring or excluding relevant material
or by taking into consideration irrelevant/inadmissible material. The finding
may also be said to be perverse if it is “against the weight of evidence”, or
if the finding so outrageously defies logic as to suffer from the vice of
irrationality. (Vide Rajinder Kumar Kindra v. Delhi Admn (1984) 4 SCC 635,
Excise and Taxation Officer-cum-Assessing Authority v. Gopi Nath & Sons
1992 Supp (2) SCC 312, Triveni Rubber & Plastics v. CCE 1994 Supp. (3)
SCC 665, Gaya Din v. Hanuman Prasad (2001) 1 SCC 501, Aruvelu v.
State (2009) 10 SCC 206 and Gamini Bala Koteswara Rao v. State of A.P
7.2.2          It is further observed, after following the decision of this
Court in the case of Kuldeep Singh v. Commissioner of Police (1999) 2
SCC 10, that if a decision is arrived at on the basis of no evidence or
thoroughly unreliable evidence and no reasonable person would act
upon it, the order would be perverse. But if there is some evidence on
record which is acceptable and which could be relied upon, the
conclusions would not be treated as perverse and the findings would not
be interfered with.
7.3    In the decision of this Court in the case of Vijay Mohan Singh v.
State of Karnataka (2019) 5 SCC 436, this Court again had an occasion
to consider the scope of Section 378 Cr.P.C. and the interference by the
High Court in an appeal against acquittal. This Court considered catena
of decisions of this Court right from 1952 onwards. In paragraph 31, it is
“31. An identical question came to be considered before this Court in
Umedbhai Jadavbhai (1978) 1 SCC 228. In the case before this Court, the
High Court interfered with the order of acquittal passed by the learned trial
court on re-appreciation of the entire evidence on record. However, the
High Court, while reversing the acquittal, did not consider the reasons
given by the learned trial court while acquitting the accused. Confirming
the judgment of the High Court, this Court observed and held in para 10 as
“10. Once the appeal was rightly entertained against the order of
acquittal, the High Court was entitled to reappreciate the entire
evidence independently and come to its own conclusion. Ordinarily, the
High Court would give due importance to the opinion of the Sessions
Judge if the same were arrived at after proper appreciation of the
evidence. This rule will not be applicable in the present case where the
Sessions Judge has made an absolutely wrong assumption of a very
material and clinching aspect in the peculiar circumstances of the case.”
31.1. In Sambasivan v. State of Kerala (1998) 5 SCC 412, the High Court
reversed the order of acquittal passed by the learned trial court and held
the accused guilty on re-appreciation of the entire evidence on record,
however, the High Court did not record its conclusion on the question
whether the approach of the trial court in dealing with the evidence was
patently illegal or the conclusions arrived at by it were wholly untenable.
Confirming the order passed by the High Court convicting the accused on
reversal of the acquittal passed by the learned trial court, after being
satisfied that the order of acquittal passed by the learned trial court was
perverse and suffered from infirmities, this Court declined to interfere with
the order of conviction passed by the High Court. While confirming the
order of conviction passed by the High Court, this Court observed in para
“8. We have perused the judgment under appeal to ascertain whether
the High Court has conformed to the aforementioned principles. We find
that the High Court has not strictly proceeded in the manner laid down
by this Court in Ramesh Babulal Doshi v. State of Gujarat (1996) 9 SCC
225 viz. first recording its conclusion on the question whether the
approach of the trial court in dealing with the evidence was patently
illegal or the conclusions arrived at by it were wholly untenable, which
alone will justify interference in an order of acquittal though the High
Court has rendered a well-considered judgment duly meeting all the
contentions raised before it. But then will this non-compliance per se
justify setting aside the judgment under appeal? We think, not. In our
view, in such a case, the approach of the court which is considering the
validity of the judgment of an appellate court which has reversed the
order of acquittal passed by the trial court, should be to satisfy itself if
the approach of the trial court in dealing with the evidence was patently
illegal or conclusions arrived at by it are demonstrably unsustainable
and whether the judgment of the appellate court is free from those
infirmities; if so to hold that the trial court judgment warranted
interference. In such a case, there is obviously no reason why the
appellate court’s judgment should be disturbed. But if on the other hand
the court comes to the conclusion that the judgment of the trial court
does not suffer from any infirmity, it cannot but be held that the
interference by the appellate court in the order of acquittal was not
justified; then in such a case the judgment of the appellate court has to
be set aside as of the two reasonable views, the one in support of the
acquittal alone has to stand. Having regard to the above discussion, we
shall proceed to examine the judgment of the trial court in this case.”
31.2. In K. Ramakrishnan Unnithan v. State of Kerala (1999) 3 SCC 309,
after observing that though there is some substance in the grievance of
the learned counsel appearing on behalf of the accused that the High
Court has not adverted to all the reasons given by the trial Judge for
according an order of acquittal, this Court refused to set aside the order of
conviction passed by the High Court after having found that the approach
of the Sessions Judge in recording the order of acquittal was not proper
and the conclusion arrived at by the learned Sessions Judge on several
aspects was unsustainable. This Court further observed that as the
Sessions Judge was not justified in discarding the relevant/material
evidence while acquitting the accused, the High Court, therefore, was fully
entitled to reappreciate the evidence and record its own conclusion. This
Court scrutinised the evidence of the eyewitnesses and opined that
reasons adduced by the trial court for discarding the testimony of the
eyewitnesses were not at all sound. This Court also observed that as the
evaluation of the evidence made by the trial court was manifestly
erroneous and therefore it was the duty of the High Court to interfere with
an order of acquittal passed by the learned Sessions Judge.
31.3. In Atley v. State of U.P. AIR 1955 SC 807, in para 5, this Court
“5. It has been argued by the learned counsel for the appellant that the
judgment of the trial court being one of acquittal, the High Court should not
have set it aside on mere appreciation of the evidence led on behalf of the
prosecution unless it came to the conclusion that the judgment of the trial
Judge was perverse. In our opinion, it is not correct to say that unless the
appellate court in an appeal under Section 417 CrPC came to the
conclusion that the judgment of acquittal under appeal was perverse it
could not set aside that order.
It has been laid down by this Court that it is open to the High Court on an
appeal against an order of acquittal to review the entire evidence and to
come to its own conclusion, of course, keeping in view the well-
established rule that the presumption of innocence of the accused is not
weakened but strengthened by the judgment of acquittal passed by the
trial court which had the advantage of observing the demeanour of
witnesses whose evidence have been recorded in its presence.
It is also well settled that the court of appeal has as wide powers of
appreciation of evidence in an appeal against an order of acquittal as in
the case of an appeal against an order of conviction, subject to the riders
that the presumption of innocence with which the accused person starts in
the trial court continues even up to the appellate stage and that the
appellate court should attach due weight to the opinion of the trial court
which recorded the order of acquittal.
If the appellate court reviews the evidence, keeping those principles in
mind, and comes to a contrary conclusion, the judgment cannot be said to
have been vitiated. (See in this connection the very cases cited at the Bar,
namely, Surajpal Singh v. State AIR 1952 SC 52; Wilayat Khan v. State of
U.P AIR 1953 SC 122) In our opinion, there is no substance in the
contention raised on behalf of the appellant that the High Court was not
justified in reviewing the entire evidence and coming to its own
conclusions.
31.4. In K. Gopal Reddy v. State of A.P. (1979) 1 SCC 355, this Court has
observed that where the trial court allows itself to be beset with fanciful
doubts, rejects creditworthy evidence for slender reasons and takes a view
of the evidence which is but barely possible, it is the obvious duty of the
High Court to interfere in the interest of justice, lest the administration of
justice be brought to ridicule.”
7.4   In the case of Umedbhai Jadavbhai (supra), in paragraph 10, it is
“10.     Once the appeal was rightly entertained against the order of
acquittal, the High Court was entitled to re-appreciate the entire evidence
independently and come to its own conclusion. Ordinarily, the High Court
would give due importance to the opinion of the Sessions Judge if the
same were arrived at after proper appreciation of the evidence. This rule
will not be applicable in the present case where the Sessions Judge has
made an absolutely wrong assumption of a very material and clinching
aspect in the peculiar circumstances of the case.”
7.5    In the case of Atley v. State of Uttar Pradesh AIR 1955 SC 807,
“5. It has been argued by the learned counsel for the appellant that the
judgment of the trial court being one of acquittal, the High Court should not
have set it aside on mere appreciation of the evidence led on behalf of the
prosecution unless it came to the conclusion that the judgment of the trial
Judge was perverse. In Our opinion, it is not correct to say that unless the
appellate court in an appeal under Section 417, Criminal P. C. came to the
conclusion that the judgment of acquittal under appeal was perverse it
could not set aside that order.
It has been laid down by this Court that it is open to the High Court on an
appeal against an order of acquittal to review the entire evidence and to
come to its own conclusion, of course, keeping in view the well established
rule that the presumption of innocence of the accused is not weakened but
strengthened by the judgment of acquittal passed by the trial court which
had the advantage of observing the demeanour of witnesses whose
evidence have been recorded in its presence.
It is also well settled that the court of appeal has as wide powers of
appreciation of evidence in an appeal against an order of acquittal as in
the case of an appeal against an order of conviction, subject to the riders
that the presumption of innocence with which the accused person starts in
the trial court continues even up to the appellate stage and that the
appellate court should attach due weight to the opinion of the trial court
which recorded the order of acquittal.
If the appellate court reviews the evidence, keeping those principles in
mind, and comes to a contrary conclusion, the judgment cannot be said to
have been vitiated. (See in this connection the very cases cited at the Bar,
namely, Surajpal Singh v. The State 1952 CriLJ331; Wilayat Khan v. State
of Uttar Pradesh, AIR 1953 SC 122. In our opinion, there is no substance
in the contention raised on behalf of the appellant that the High Court was
not justified in reviewing the entire evidence and coming to its own
conclusions.”
7.6     In the case of K.Gopal Reddy v. State of Andhra Pradesh (1979)
1 SCC 355, this Court has observed that where the trial Court allows
itself to be beset with fanciful doubts, rejects creditworthy evidence for
slender reasons and takes a view of the evidence which is but barely
possible, it is the obvious duty of the High Court to interfere in the
interest of justice, lest the administration of justice be brought to
ridicule.
8.      Applying the law laid down by this Court in the aforesaid decisions
to the facts of the case on hand, it is to be considered whether in the
facts and circumstances of the case, the High Court is justified in
interfering with the order of acquittal passed by the learned trial Court?
8.1     The grounds on which the learned trial Court acquitted the
accused are narrated by the High Court in the impugned judgment,
1. The motive assigned to respondents to commit the murder of Ram Aasare
Pathak may be the reason of their false implication in this case;
2. Badri Prasad (P.W.1) and Lal Mani (P.W.3) are the chance witnesses whereas
Shatrughan Prasad Pathak (P.W.2), Lal Mani (P.W.3) and Ram Ganesh
Pathak (P.W.4) the witnesses of fact are related and interested witnesses
inasmuch as Shatrughan Prasad Pathak (P.W.2) and Ram Ganesh Pathak
(P.W.4) are the sons of the deceased wheareas Lal Mani (P.W.3) is relatives
3. No independent public witness has been examined. According to him, even
P.W.2 and P.W.4 sons of the deceased may also be termed as chance
4. Place of occurrence is not proved by the prosecution and there was no
occasion for the deceased to reach at the alleged spot if at all he was going to
5. Absence of the firearm injury at the person of the deceased belied the
7. The prosecution has not explained the injury of accused Murlidhar Pathak;
8. Although respondents have not adduced any evidence in their defence to
prove the fact that deceased sustained injuries at the door of Murlidhar
Pathak or the injuries at his person was caused by mob or public, or Murlidhar
Pathak received injuries at his own door at the instance of deceased, yet in
any case, the possibility of exercise of right of private defence by respondents
cannot be said to be improbable.
Each and every aforesaid ground has been elaborately dealt with
by the High Court and on reappreciation of the entire evidence on
record the High Court has specifically come to the conclusion that the
findings recorded by the learned trial Court are perverse and thereafter
the High Court has interfered with the judgment and order of acquittal
passed by the learned trial Court.
9.    So far as the submission on behalf of the accused that no motive
has been established and proved is concerned, the High Court has
elaborately dealt with the same. The High Court has rightly observed
that when there is a direct evidence in the form of eyewitnesses and the
eyewitnesses are trustworthy and reliable, absence of motive is
insignificant.    In the present case, in the 313 statement itself, the
appellant – original accused no.4 has also stated that there was an
enmity. Therefore, even according to the accused also, there was an
enmity.
10.   One another ground given by the learned trial Court while
acquitting the accused was that no independent witness has been
examined. The High Court has rightly observed that where there are
clinching evidence of eyewitnesses, mere non-examination of some of
the witnesses/independent witnesses and/or in absence of examination
of any independent witnesses would not be fatal to the case of the
prosecution.
10.1 In the case of Manjit Singh v. State of Punjab (2019) 8 SCC 529, it
is observed and held by this Court that reliable evidence of injured
eyewitnesses cannot be discarded merely for reason that no
independent witness was examined.
10.2 In the recent decision in the case of Surinder Kumar v. State of
Punjab (2020) 2 SCC 563, it is observed and held by this Court that
merely because prosecution did not examine any independent witness,
would not necessarily lead to conclusion that accused was falsely
implicated.
10.3 In the case of Rizwan Khan v. State of Chhattisgarh (2020) 9 SCC
627, after referring to the decision of this Court in the case of State of
H.P. v. Pardeep Kumar (2018) 13 SCC 808, it is observed and held by
this Court that the examination of independent witnesses is not an
indispensable requirement and such non-examination is not necessarily
fatal to the prosecution case.
11.    Applying the law laid down by this Court in the aforesaid decisions
to the facts of the case on hand and when, as observed by the High
Court, the prosecution witnesses have fully supported the case of the
prosecution, more particularly PW2 & PW4 and they are found to be
trustworthy and reliable, non-examination of the independent witnesses
is not fatal to the case of the prosecution. Nothing is on record that
those two persons, namely, Shiv Shankar and Bhagwati Prasad as
mentioned in the FIR reached the spot were mentioned as witnesses in
the chargesheet. In any case, PW2 & PW4 have fully supported the
case of the prosecution and therefore non-examination of the aforesaid
two persons shall not be fatal to the case of the prosecution.
12.    Now so far as the submission on behalf of the accused that injury
on one of the accused – Murlidhar Pathak has not been explained by
the prosecution and reliance placed on the decision of this Court in the
case of Dashrath Singh v. State of U.P. (2004) 7 SCC 408 is concerned,
at the outset, it is required to be noted that the investigating officer
-PW7 in his examination-in-chief in paragraph 6 has specifically stated
that when they tried to arrest the said accused at 4:00 a.m. in the early
morning near the      bridge, the said accused tried to run away; after
scuffle he was arrested and that during that scuffle and arrest, he
sustained injuries.      A suggestion was put to him in the cross-
examination that at the time of arrest the accused Murlidhar Pathak did
not receive any injury, however, the same has been specifically denied
that it is not true that he did not receive injury at the time of his arrest.
Similar suggestions were made to other witnesses and the same were
denied. Therefore, as such, it cannot be said that the prosecution has
failed to explain the injury on the said accused. Even the aforesaid
aspect has been considered in detail by the High Court and the said
statement has been appreciated by the High Court on re-appreciating
the entire evidence on record, more particularly the medical evidence
and even the deposition of the doctors examined by the prosecution as
well as by the defence.
12.1. Now so far as the reliance placed upon the decision of this Court
in the case of Dashrath Singh (supra) is concerned, the observations
made by this Court in the aforesaid decision are required to be
considered, considering the facts and circumstances of the case. In the
said case, defence of the accused was that there was a free fight
between both the parties and therefore the question arose with respect
to the right of the private defence and/or who was the aggressor. Even
otherwise in the said decision also, this Court referred to paragraph 17
of the decision of this Court in the case of Takhaji Hiraji v. Thakore
Kubersing Chamansing (2001) 6 SCC 145 in paragraph 18, which
“17. … the view taken consistently is that it cannot be held as a matter of
law or invariably a rule that whenever the accused sustained an injury in the
same occurrence, the prosecution is obliged to explain the injury and on the
failure of the prosecution to do so the prosecution case should be
disbelieved. Before non-explanation of the injuries on the persons of the
accused persons by the prosecution witnesses may affect the prosecution
case, the court has to be satisfied of the existence of two conditions: (i) that
the injury on the person of the accused was of a serious nature; and (ii) that
such injuries must have been caused at the time of the occurrence in
question. Non-explanation of injuries assumes greater significance when the
evidence consists of interested or partisan witnesses or where the defence
gives a version which competes in probability with that of the prosecution.
Where the evidence is clear, cogent and creditworthy and where the court
can distinguish the truth from falsehood the mere fact that the injuries on the
side of the accused persons are not explained by the prosecution cannot by
itself be a sole basis to reject the testimony of the prosecution witnesses and
consequently the whole of the prosecution case.
18. The High Court was therefore not right in overthrowing the entire
prosecution case for non-explanation of the injuries sustained by the
accused persons.”
12.2 Thereafter, in paragraph 19, it is observed and held as under:
“19. The injuries of serious nature received by the accused in the course
of the same occurrence would indicate that there was a fight between both
the parties. In such a situation, the question as to the genesis of the fight,
that is to say, the events leading to the fight and which party initiated the
first attack assumes great importance in reaching the ultimate decision. It
is here that the need to explain the injuries of serious nature received by
the accused in the course of same occurrence arises. When explanation is
given, the correctness of the explanation is liable to be tested. If there is
an omission to explain, it may lead to the inference that the prosecution
has suppressed some of the relevant details concerning the incident. The
Court has then to consider whether such omission casts a reasonable
doubt on the entire prosecution story or it will have any effect on the other
reliable evidence available having bearing on the origin of the incident.
Ultimately, the factum of non-explanation of injuries is one circumstance
which has to be kept in view while appreciating the evidence of
prosecution witnesses. In case the prosecution version is sought to be
proved by partisan or interested witnesses, the non-explanation of serious
injuries may prima facie make a dent on the credibility of their evidence.
So also where the defence version accords with probabilities to such an
extent that it is difficult to predicate which version is true, then, the factum
of non-explanation of the injuries assumes greater importance. Much
depends on the quality of the evidence adduced by the prosecution and it
is from that angle, the weight to be attached to the aspect of non-
explanation of the injuries should be considered. The decisions above-
cited would make it clear that there cannot be a mechanical or isolated
approach in examining the question whether the prosecution case is
vitiated by reason of non-explanation of injuries. In other words, the non-
explanation of injuries of the accused is one of the factors that could be
taken into account in evaluating the prosecution evidence and the intrinsic
worth of the defence version.”
13.    At this stage, it is required to be noted that in the present case
even considering the defence on behalf of the accused when the
deceased came near the door of the house of the one of the accused
Murlidhar Pathak, he was using abusive language and there were a
quarrel and the other village people might have caused injuries on the
deceased. Therefore, the incident is not disputed by the accused. The
place of occurrence of the incident has been established and proved by
the prosecution as per the case of the prosecution. The accused have
failed to lead any evidence that the incident had occurred near the door
of the house of one of the accused. Even the place of incident
suggested by the accused, if the Panchama is concerned, it does not
support the case of the defence.                 The aforesaid aspect has been
elaborately dealt with by the High Court in the impugned judgment and
order.     It has been established and proved by the prosecution by
leading the evidence that the incident had taken place on the road near
Primary Pathshala. The dead body was recovered from the road near
Primary Pathshala and the blood stained Gamchha and tahmad were
also recovered from that place. On the point of place of recovery of the
dead body and recovery of the blood stained etc. is unchallenged.
Therefore, the prosecution has proved the place of incident as stated in
the FIR.
14.   Now so far as one another ground assigned by the learned trial
Court while acquitting the accused that there was no firearm injury on
the person of the deceased and therefore the medical evidence is
inconsistent with the ocular testimony is concerned, it is required to be
noted that it was never the case of the prosecution that there was a
firearm injury on the person of the deceased. Even as per the evidence
of the witnesses, when after sustaining the injuries of lathi and spear,
the deceased fell down on the earth when other persons started coming
and while leaving from that place, one of the accused Ramraj Pathak
fired his pistol towards the deceased. It was never the case of the
witnesses that bullet hit the deceased. On the contrary, Shatrughan
Prasad Pathak, PW2 has specifically stated that the deceased has not
sustained any firearm injury, although Ramraj Pathak has fired at him.
15.   We have carefully gone through the depositions of PW2 & PW4
who can be said to be the star witnesses and they are the eyewitnesses
to the incident. From the deposition of PW2 (Hindi version, para 9),
learned counsel appearing on behalf of the appellant has vehemently
submitted that the said witness has specifically admitted that at the
night of the incident, he was at 291, Malviya Nagar and after receiving
the information he reached at the spot.           However, there is an
overwriting in para 9 and the words “not true” have been struck off by
pen and what is overwriting is “it is true”. Who made this overwriting is
difficult to say at this stage? Even the aforesaid was not even pointed
out and/or submitted before the learned trial Court or even before the
High Court. However, if we read the entire para 9 as a whole, it is very
difficult to accept that he admitted that he was not present in the village
in the morning and therefore his presence can be doubted. Be that as it
may, even if for the time being evidence of PW2 is not considered
and/or excluded, there is an overwhelming evidence in support of the
prosecution in the form of PW4. His presence is not doubted. He is
found to be trustworthy and reliable. His deposition is consistent with
the allegations in the FIR.         There is no reason to doubt his
trustworthiness. Therefore, even the appellant can be and is rightly
convicted relying upon the deposition of PW4, who is an eyewitness to
the incident.
16.      Now let us consider the case and/or defence on behalf of the
appellant – original accused no.4. It was the case on behalf of the
accused that the incident occurred at the door of the house of the
accused Murlidhar Pathak and that Murlidhar Pathak, another accused,
was being hurdled abuses and assaulted by the deceased and the mob
inflicted injuries on the person of the deceased.      Except the above
statement, the same has not been established and proved by the
defence by leading cogent evidence, more particularly when the
accused have examined three defence witnesses. Nobody from the
mob has been examined by them. Even in his 313 statement, the only
defence of the appellant -accused no.4 was that he has been falsely
implicated in the case due to enmity and that he was not there. He has
not led any evidence to prove that he was elsewhere.
17.     Considering the aforesaid facts and circumstances of the case
and on re-appreciation of the evidence, when the High Court has come
to the conclusion that the findings recorded by the learned trial Court
while acquitting the accused were perverse and even contrary to the
evidence on record and/or misreading of the evidence, the High Court
has rightly interfered with the judgment and order of acquittal passed by
the learned trial Court and has rightly convicted the accused. In the
present case, the appellant – original accused no.4 was specifically
named right from the very beginning in the FIR. He has been attributed
the specific role. The same has been established and proved from the
evidence of PW4 (even if the deposition of PW2 is for the time being
ignored). No error has been committed by the High Court in interfering
with the judgment and order of acquittal passed by the learned trial
18.    In view of the above and for the reasons stated above, we see no
reason to interfere with the impugned judgment and order passed by
the High Court reversing the acquittal and convicting the accused. We
are in complete agreement with the view taken by the High Court. The
present appeal is accordingly dismissed.
19.    As the appellant – Guru Dutt Pathak, original accused no.4 was
granted interim bail up to 30.04.2021 and thereafter the same has not
been extended by this Court and the present appeal is now dismissed,
if the accused has not surrendered so far, he shall surrender himself
forthwith to serve out the sentence.
