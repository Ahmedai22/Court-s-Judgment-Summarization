             UPON hearing the counsel the Court made the following
             The Court is convened through Video Conferencing.
             The applications for exemption from filing affidavit
are allowed.
             These Suo-motu proceedings were initiated on 16.7.2021
basing on the reports stating non-release of the prisoners after
the grant of bail. This Court, therefore, contemplated to adopt
the procedure termed as FASTER (Fast and Secured Transmission of
Electronic Records) to ensure that such situation does not arise
in future.
             In furtherance of the same we directed the Secretary
General     of   this  Court   to  submit  a  proposal  suggesting  the
modalities      to  implement   the   FASTER  system.  We  had  further
directed the Secretary General to co-ordinate/consult the Amicus
Curiae Mr. Dushyant Dave, learned senior counsel and Mr. Tushar
Mehta, learned Solicitor General of India, National Informatic
Centre and other Government authorities.
             In   compliance   of  the   aforesaid  order,  a  proposal
suggesting modalities to implement the FASTER system has been
placed before this Court by the Secretary General.
             Heard learned Amicus Curiae on the proposal submitted
by the Secretary General of this Court.
               We are concerned about the plight of the jail- inmates
who are not released despite the bail orders passed by this Court
due to delay in communication of such orders. It is high time to
utilize the Information and Communication Technology tools for
efficient transmission of Courtâ€™s orders.
             The FASTER (Fast and Secured Transmission of Electronic
Records) system proposes transmission of e-authenticated copies
of the interim orders, stay orders, bail orders and record of
proceedings to the duty-holders for compliance and due execution,
through a secured electronic communication channel.
             The   proposal    contains     the   pre-requisites     and   the
timelines to work out the pre-requisites for implementation of
the FASTER system.
             19 States have submitted compliance report/affidavits
with regard to availability of internet facility in prisons. The
States of Arunachal Pradesh, Nagaland, Assam and Mizoram have
indicated      non-availability/partial        availability     of   internet
connectivity. Rest of the States have not filed affidavits in
this   regard.     We   direct    the   Chief    Secretaries    of   all   the
States/UTs to ensure the availability of internet facility with
adequate     speed   in   each   and   every   jail   in   their   respective
States/UTs     and   take   necessary    steps   to  arrange   for   internet
facility expeditiously wherever the same is not available. Till
then, communication shall be made through the Nodal Officers of
the State Governments under FASTER system.
Secretary      (Home)   of    all   the   States/UTs     and   the   Director
General/Inspector General of Prisons of all the States/UTs shall
ensure smooth and successful implementation of FASTER system and
shall coordinate with the Registry of this Court in this regard.
             The requisite amendment in the Rules and Procedure for
the Supreme Court of India be taken up on the administrative
side.    Further,      all    the    duty-holders     shall     amend    their
Rules/Procedure/Practice/directions forthwith, to recognize the
e-authenticated copy of the order of this Court communicated to
them through FASTER system and shall comply with the directions
contained therein.
             List the matter after two weeks.
