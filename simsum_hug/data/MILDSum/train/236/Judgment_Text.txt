Sajakali Jamadar                  2 of 10
The Petitioner was directed to be externed from the areas of Police
Commissioner at Nashik City and Nashik Rural District for a period
of one year.
3.          The appeal preferred by the Petitioner challenging the
aforesaid order was rejected vide order dated 27 th August, 2021.
Impugned order of externment was confirmed.
4.          Undisputedly, the period of externment was one year. The
petitioner has suffered the entire period of externment.
5.          Learned Advocate Mr. Harekrishna Mishra appearing for the
petitioner has urged as follows :-
i)      Although the period of externment is suffered by the
petitioner, the order is required to be challenged since it was
an abuse of process of law. The authorities are exercising the
powers of externment arbitrarily.
ii)     All the offences were registered with Panchavati Police
Station, which squarely falls within the jurisdiction of Deputy
Commissioner of Police, Zone – 1, Nashik City, which would
mean that the activities of the petitioner is confined only to
the limits of Panchavati Police Station. However, the petitioner
has been externed from excessive area. The order suffers from
non application of mind.
iii)    The Appellate Authority has mechanically rejected the
Appeal and confirmed the order of externment.
iv)     The externing authority has taken into consideration
old and stale cases for externing the petitioner.
v)      The order of externment is violative of principle of
double jeopardy.      While issuing the impugned order, the
respondents have taken into account even those offences for
which the petitioner had been externed earlier.     Out of eight
FIR’s are on the basis of which the impugned order has been
issued by relying upon five FIR’s, Deputy Commissioner of
Police, Zone – 1 had passed two externment orders i.e.
externment order dated 8th December, 2017 which was
modified by the Appellate authority by its order dated 22 nd
May, 2018 and order of externment dated 6 th November, 2019
which was also modified by the Appellate Authority vide order
dated 12th March, 2020.
vi)     The petitioner cannot be subjected to externment
repeatedly by relying upon the same material. The order is
arbitrary. It is violative of Article – 19 of the Constitution of
vii)    The show cause notices dated 24th February, 2021 and
Sajakali Jamadar                       4 of 10
9th April, 2021 are silent about the earlier two externment
orders.     The externment order was passed on extraneous
material.
viii)      The first Five FIR’s are the subject matter of previous
two externment orders are out of rest three offences
mentioned at Serial Nos. 6, 7 & 8, C.R. No.661 of 2020
registered with Panchavati Police Station is the offence which
would fall within Chapter 16 and 17 of the Code.
6.               The learned Advocate for Petitioner has relied upon
following decisions :-
i)       Iqbal Hussain Abid Hussain Qureshi V/s. The State of
ii)      The decision of this Court, in the case of Subhash
Ganu Bhoir V/s. K.P. Raghuwanshi and Ors. decided on
2nd April, 1986 in Criminal Writ Petition 173 of 1986.
iii)     Mrunal Bhalchandra Ghodke V/s. The State of
Maharashtra and Ors.2
iv)      Jeetendra Ashok Bhosale V/s. Divisional Commissioner
Council Hall and Others.3
v)       The decision of this Court, in the case of Mohseen
Solapur and Ors. decided on 6th July, 2021 in Criminal Writ
Petition 2093 of 2021.
7.         Learned A.P.P. submitted that, the petition has become
infructuous. The period of externment has already lapsed. The
petitioner is involved in several offences.           The petitioner is
repeatedly committing offences. The subjective satisfaction of the
externing authority is reflected in the order of externment. The
principle of double jeopardy is not applicable in the present case.
There was sufficient material before the externing authority to
extern the petitioner. The externment was for a period of one year.
The appellate authority has confirmed the order of externment.
The order is not excessive.
8.         Although the petitioner has suffered the order of externment
and the period of externment has lapsed, there is no impediment in
challenging the impugned order of externment.            In the case of
Iqbal Hussain Abid Hussain Qureshi V/s. The State of Maharashtra
& Ors. (supra) this Court has entertained the petition challenging
the order of externment considering the fact that the period of
externment had expired during the pendency of petition and if the
order is allowed to stand, it is likely to affect the petitioner therein
in other proceedings. The order of externment was set aside on
merits.          In the case of Mohseen Mohammed Sallem Nadaf V/s.
D.C.P. Zone Solapur City, Solapur and Ors. (supra) this Court has
Sajakali Jamadar                     6 of 10
dealt with the order externment after the period of externment had
expired. The Court noted the merits of the case and set aside the
order of externment. It was observed that, undoubtedly the period
of externment has come to an end but having arrived at the
conclusion that the order of externment is bad in law, the Court
would not be justified in not declaring it void and non-est for the
only the reason that the period of externment is over.
9.         On perusal of the documents on record it is evident that the
petitioner has been externed vide order dated 4 th May, 2021 by
relying upon seven cases and two in camera statements.                 The
appellate authority has rejected the appeal preferred by the
petitioner and thereby confirmed the order of externment. The
petitioner has placed on record the order of externment dated
8th December, 2017 issued by Deputy Commissioner of Police, Zone
– 1, Nashik City, wherein the petitioner was externed from the area
mentioned therein. The said order refers to C.R.No.308 of 2015
registered with Panchavati Police Station. The C.R.No.308 of 2015
is also subject matter of impugned order dated 415 of 2021. The
order of externment dated 6th November, 2019 was also issued by
Deputy Commissioner of Police Zone – 1 Nashik City under Section
56(1)(a) & (b) of the Maharashtra Police Act. The said order refers
Sajakali Jamadar                  7 of 10
to C.R.No. 308 of 2015, C.R. No.438 of 2017 registered with
Panchavati Police Station and C.R. No.153 of 2018 registered with
Panchavati Police Station. All these cases are considered in
impugned externment order.
10.        Thus, it is apparent that, while issuing the impugned order of
externment, the externing authority has relied upon the cases
which were also subject matter of previous orders of externment. It
is pertinent to note that, all the orders were issued by the same
authority.        The powers of externment are exercised in most
arbitrary manner. The externee cannot be externed repeatedly by
relying upon the same material. The previous order were modified
by the appellate authority. The externee cannot be subjected to
rigors of externment by relying upon the same cases. It is violative
of Article 19 of the Constitution of India. The freedom of persons is
restricted by exercising the powers of externment in most causal
11.        In the case of Subhash Ganu Bhoir V/s. K.P. Raghuwanshi
and Ors. (supra) this Court had set aside the order of externment
on the ground that, the impugned order was based on some of the
grounds which were the subject matter of earlier externment
proceedings which could not have been made basis of the present
Sajakali Jamadar                      8 of 10
externment proceedings. It is also pertinent to note that, reference
of the cases which were referred in the previous order of
externment would also indicate that the externing authority is
relying on the stale cases to initiate externment proceedings. The
impugned order was issued mechanically by taking recourse to old
and stale cases which were the subject matter of earlier
proceedings, no order could have been passed under Section 56(a)
(b) of the Maharashtra Police Act. In the case of Jeetendra Ashok
Bhosale V/s. Divisional Commissioner Council Hall and Others
(supra) this Court has observed that the externing authority cannot
take stale cases for initiating externment proceedings.            The
externing authority must apply its mind to the fact of live link
between the registration of old cases and initiation of externment
proceedings. In the case of Mrunal Bhalchandra Ghodke V/s. The
State of Maharashtra and Ors. (supra) this Court had set aside the
order of externment on account of non application of mind. The
order of externment was based on the same material, which was
considered for the previous proposal to extern the extrnee. The
Petitioner therein could not have been externed on the basis of
material, which is already taken into consideration on the earlier
occasion and found to be insufficient.
Sajakali Jamadar                 9 of 10
12.         The impugned order reflects complete non application of
mind and casual approach of the authorities initiating externment
proceedings.        The order deserves to be quashed and set aside.
Hence, I pass the following order :-
i.      Writ Petition No.6391 of 2021 is allowed and disposed
ii.     Order    dated    04.05.2021    passed    by     Deputy
Commissioner of Police Zone-1, Nashik City, District Nashik
issued under Section 56(1)(a)(b) of Maharashtra Police Act
and    order   dated    27.08.2021    passed   by    Divisional
Commissioner, Nashik Division, Nashik in Externment Appeal
No. 56 of 2021 are quashed and set aside.
