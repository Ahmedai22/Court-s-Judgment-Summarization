1.     Petitioner      is   the   husband    of  the   alleged
detenue. He seeks issuance of a writ of habeas
corpus to cause production of the alleged detenue,
on the premise that she is under illegal detention
of    her      father/fifth    respondent.    The   petitioner
would aver that he married the alleged detenue,
pursuant to a deep love affair, on 26.4.2022. They
belong        to   different   religions    and   due  to  the
possible         objections  from    their   families,   their
marriage         was  got  registered    under    the  Special
Marriage Act. However, from 12.5.2022 onwards, the
detenue is not contacting the petitioner and she
has     been      illegally  confined    by   her   father/the
fifth       respondent.    Ext.P2   complaint   preferred   by
the     petitioner      before  the   jurisdictional    police
evoked no response and, hence, the writ petition
is filed.
2.     As per order dated 19.5.2022, we directed the
third respondent/S.H.O to get a statement of the
alleged detenue by a Woman Civil Police Officer,
without the presence of the parents or any other
family        members   of   the    alleged   detenue.   Such
statement        is   produced    before   us,  wherein   the
alleged        detenue   would   state   that  the   marriage
before         the   Sub    Registrar,     Kuttippuram    was
registered without the knowledge of their parents;
that      the    detenue   thought    of   accompanying   the
petitioner after one month, since her mother was
alone in their house; that both the families, who
came to know about the marriage, are not willing
to accept them; that the parents of the petitioner
would never permit them to live together; that the
detenue is seriously apprehensive of her safety at
the house of the          petitioner and that she is not
under any illegal detention of her parents. The
alleged        detenue   would   state   that  she   was  not
subjected to any torture, whatsoever. Even when
the     alleged     detenue   would   express   that  she  is
desirous of living with the petitioner, she fears
that she would be ill-treated by the parents of
the petitioner.
3.     We see that the alleged detenue is ambivalent
in her stand and she prevaricates as between her
desire to be with the petitioner on the one hand,
and her serious apprehension and fear of being
ill-treated by the parents of the petitioner, on
the other hand.
4.     Having      regard  to  our   limited   jurisdiction,
where issuance of writ of habeas corpus is sought
for, we are not in a position to pass any order
enabling the alleged detenue to live along with
the petitioner. When the detenue is categoric in
her statement that she is not under any illegal
detention of her parents, we find no ground to
issue       a    writ of  habeas   corpus.   We,  therefore,
dismiss this writ petition.
