CRL.A No. 165 of 2012
3. Section 394 of Cr.P.C. deals with abatement of
appeals and it reads thus:
“394.  Abatement      of appeals.-(1)   Every
appeal under section 377 or section 378 shall
finally abate on the death of the accused.
(2) Every other appeal under this Chapter
(except an appeal from a sentence of fine) shall
finally abate on the death of the appellant:
Provided that where the appeal is against a
conviction    and   sentence     of   death   or   of
imprisonment, and the appellant dies during the
pendency of the appeal, any of his near relatives
may, within thirty days of the death of the
appellant, apply to the Appellate Court for leave
to continue the appeal; and if leave is granted,
the appeal shall not abate.
Explanation.- In this section, “near relative”
means a parent, spouse, lineal descendant,
brother or sister.”
An appeal from a sentence of fine will not abate on the
death of the appellant.
4.    In   the   present   case  appellant   has    been
sentenced to pay fine only and therefore on the death of
the appellant the appeal will not abate.
5.    Death of the convict does not discharge him
from liability from paying fine and compensation imposed
by Court and property which goes to his legal heirs after
his death is legally liable for the same. As per the proviso
to Section 394 Cr.P.C. near relatives of the appellant,
within 30 days of the death of the appellant, apply to the
appellate Court for leave to continue the appeal.
6.  The appellant died on 06.04.2019 and no such
application is filed by his near relatives to continue the
appeal. Learned counsel for the appellant submits that the
legal heirs of the appellant are not interested in making
any such application. Hence, the property of the appellant
which goes to his legal heirs after his death is legally liable
for payment of the fine amount. Hence, in view of the
CRL.A No. 165 of 2012
death of the appellant, the appeal is dismissed. The trial
Court is directed to initiate proceedings to recover the fine
amount imposed on the accused from his estate which is
inherited by the legal heirs of the appellant on his death.
