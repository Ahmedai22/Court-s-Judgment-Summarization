An  FIR   bearing  No.    04/2017   has   been   registered
against the appellant-accused Fakhrey Alam under Section
420,467, 468, 471 and 120-B, IPC and 3/25/30 of the Arms
Act and under Section 18 of the UAPA Act, 1967.
The  appellant   was  arrested    on   08.03.2017   and  on
03.06.2017, learned Court of Chief Judicial Magistrate,
Lucknow granted a     total of 180 days        to the police for
filing the charge sheet.    The police filed charge sheet on
04.09.2017 under the aforesaid provisions, except under
the UAPA Act as it was mandatory to obtain prosecution
sanction   from  the  State  Government     which   had  not  been
forthcoming till the date of filing of the charge sheet.
Thus, the charge sheet states as under :
“ That the accused are in Judicial Custody and
the remand period of the accused Fakhrey Alam
and Section 3/25/30 Arms Act is being filed
before this Hon’ble Court against the accused
persons.       It is requested to summon the
witnesses and commences the Trial of the Case.
A separate Charge Sheet shall be under Section
18 UA (P) Act shall be filed against obtaining
the prosecution sanction.”
Thereafter, a second charge sheet was filed after
obtaining sanction of the State Government           on 05.10.2017.
We  are   concerned    with   the  order   passed    by   the   Chief
Judicial    Magistrate,     Lucknow    dated   13.10.2017     on   an
application    filed   by   the   appellant    on   03.10.2017    for
default bail under Section 167 (2) of the Code of Criminal
Procedure,    1973    (hereinafter     referred    to   as       “the
Cr.P.C.”) two days prior to the charge sheet having been
filed   under  the   UAPA   Act.       The  case   set   up   by  the
appellant was that the charge sheet had been filed after
180 days and thus       he was entitled to default bail.          The
Court, however,     opined that       what   was stated     to be   a
second   charge   sheet   was   really   a   supplementary     charge
sheet and thus default bail would not be admissible.              The
aforesaid view was given its imprimatur by the High Court
in terms of the impugned order dated 03.11.2020 which has
been assailed before us.
Learned senior counsel for the appellant has made a
Firstly,    it   is   his   submission     that   the    Chief
Judicial Magistrate, Lucknow        on 03.06.2017 could not have
granted 180 days for filing of the charge sheet as the
jurisdiction in respect of offences under the UAPA Act,
which cases are entrusted to NIA, vests only with the
special courts and this aspect was no more res integra           in
view of judgment of this Court in the case of Bikramjit
Secondly, it was urged before us that even within
the 180 days period, the charge sheet/supplementary charge
sheet under the UAPA Act was not filed which gave a cause
to the appellant to file the application for default bail
on 03.10.2017     and    it is    only two    days thereafter    on
05.10.2017 after a lapse of 211 days             that this charge
sheet had been filed.
On the other hand, learned counsel for the State
submits    that  the   judgment   of   this   Court   in  Bikramjit
Singh’s case (supra) was in the given situation prevalent
in the State of Punjab, but on the other hand in State of
Uttar Pradesh the competent Court was of the special Chief
Judicial Magistrate and it is only recently now about             a
month back that     special Courts    had been notified.
On  the  second   aspect,   it   is  urged   that  what  is
called     as   the   second     charge    sheet    is   really   a
supplementary charge sheet as there is no restriction on
the number of supplementary charge sheets which can be
filed but there will be      only one charge sheet       in view of
judgment of this Court in the case of Vinay Tyagi vs.
We have examined the aforesaid pleas.
Insofar as the first aspect is concerned, suffice to
say that the situation in the State of Uttar Pradesh is
different and it is not as if there were any notified
special courts in existence.
On the second aspect we cannot lose sight of the
fact that what was envisaged by the Legislature was that
the    investigation  should  be  completed  in  24 hours  but
practically that was never found feasible.      It is in these
circumstances that Section 167 of the Cr.P.C.         provided
for time period within which the investigation should be
completed, depending upon the nature of offences.       Since,
liberty     is a  Constitutional   right,  time  periods  were
specified in the default of which the accused will have a
right to default bail, a valuable right.
If we look at the scenario in the present case in
that conspectus, the charge sheet under the provisions of
law as originally filed on 04.09.2017 were required      to be
filed within 90 days but was actually filed within 180
days.    This was on the premise of the charge under Section
18 of the UAPA Act.       However, no charge sheet was filed
even within 180 days under the UAPA Act,       but post filing
of the application for default bail, it was filed after
211 days.     Thus, undoubtedly the period of 180 days to
file the charge sheet qua UAPA Act had elapsed.          We do not
think that the State can take advantage of the fact that
in one case there is one charge sheet and supplementary
charge sheets are used to extend the time period in this
manner by seeking to file        the supplementary charge sheet
qua the offences under the UAPA Act even beyond the period
specified under Section 167 of the Cr.P.C beyond which
default bail will be admissible, i.e,          the period of 180
days.   That period having expired and the charge sheet not
having    been    filed    qua    those    offences    (albeit    a
supplementary    charge   sheet),    we  are   of  the   view   the
appellant   would    be  entitled    to   default   bail   in   the
aforesaid facts and circumstances.
We need only emphasize what is already observed           in
Bikramjit Singh case (supra) that default bail under first
proviso   of      Section   167(2)    of   the     Cr.P.C.   is   a
fundamental right and not merely a statutory right as it
is, a procedure      established by law under Article 21 of
the Constitution.     Thus a fundamental right      is granted to
an  accused    person   to   be   released   on   bail   once   the
conditions of the first proviso to Section 167(2)of the
Cr.P.C. are fulfilled.
In fact in the majority judgment of this Court it
has    been held    that an    oral application     for grant    of
default bail would suffice [See. Rakesh Kumar Paul vs.
State of Assam]3.      The consequences of the UAPA Act are
drastic in      punishment and in that context,     it has been
held not to be a mere         statutory right but part of the
procedure     established  by   law  under  Article  21  of  the
Constitution of India.
We are thus of the view that the impugned order(s)
are liable to be set aside.        The appellant is entitled to
default bail under Section 167(2)of the          Cr.P.C. in the
given facts of the case on the terms and conditions to the
satisfaction of the trial Court.
The appeal is accordingly allowed leaving he parties
to bear their own costs.
