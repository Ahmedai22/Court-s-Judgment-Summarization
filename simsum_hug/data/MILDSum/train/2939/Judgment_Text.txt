10.     It is thus clear that there is a clear regulation/regime that has been laid
down by the Central Government to regulate the information/content which
is available to the general public through various media platforms. As far as
television is concerned, the Cinematograph Act, 1952, and the Cable
Television Networks (Regulation) Act, 1995, addresses the issue regarding
regulation of content which is being telecasted on these platforms. The
contention of the Petitioner that there is no regulatory authority is incorrect.
Directing for appointment of a regulatory authority would result in
legislation by this Court which is not permissible. The concept of separation
of powers between legislature, judiciary and executive has been laid down in
By:SHAZAAD ZAKIR        W.P.(C) 4319/2021                                                       Page 20 of 21
various judgments by the Apex Court. Courts cannot mandate a statute or
add provisions to a Statute as it would amount to legislation which is not
permissible in the constitutional scheme of this country.
11.     The Apex Court vide Judgment dated 16.04.2021 in W.P. (C) No.
428/2021 titled as John Paily v. The State of Kerala, has held that Courts do
not possess the power to set up an adjudicatory committee or a tribunal by
way of issuing a writ of mandamus. The role of judiciary is primarily only to
test the legality of a statute and not to amend/modify a statute. Setting up of
tribunals, authorities, regulators come purely within the domain of
legislature and not in the domain of Courts.
12.     In view of the above, there is no merit in the instant Writ Petition.
13.     Accordingly, the Writ Petition is dismissed, along with pending
application(s), if any.
