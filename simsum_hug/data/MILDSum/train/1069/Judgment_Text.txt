(Order of the Court was made by S.S.SUNDAR.J.,)
While considering the scope of entertaining writ petition under
Article 226 of Constitution on India against               Registration of Unilateral
cancellation deed, a Division Bench of this Court in the case of P.Rukumani
and others vs Amudhavalli and others reported in 2020 (1)CTC 241 held that
a writ petition challenging the deed of cancellation is a misconceived remedy
and set aside the judgment of learned Single Judge allowing a writ petition
seeking cancellation of the cancellation deed. The Division Bench relying upon
the judgment of Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Satyapaul Anand vs
State of Madhya Pradesh and ors., held that aggrieved party in such cases can
approach only the civil court. Since the judgment of Division Bench in
P.Rukumani's case is contrary to the full Bench in Latif Estate's case and the
Division Bench has referred to judgment of Hon'ble Supreme Court in Satya
paul Anand's case, Hon'ble Mr. Justice S.Vaidyanathan before whom the batch
of writ petitions namely W.P(MD)Nos.11674 of 2015, 8330, 13297 of 2020
and 6889 of 2020 were argued, noticed the conflicting judgements and referred
the matter to a larger Bench to decide the question “whether the Registrar has
the power to accept the deed of cancellation to nullify the deed of conveyance
made earlier, when the deed of conveyance has already been acted upon by the
W.P.(MD).Nos.6889,8330,13297 of 2020,11674 of 2015
and W.A(MD)No.800 of 2022
transferee.” This is how the matter is now placed before this Bench by order of
Hon'ble the Chief Justice.
2.From the facts in the individual cases, it is seen that the writ
petition namely, W.P(MD)No.6889 of 2020 does not come under the purview of
reference. Though Hon'ble Mr.Justice S.Vaithiyanathan, has posed several
questions of law, while considering the individual cases, the issue that was
referred to the larger bench is only about the Registration of Unilateral
Cancellation deed to nullify the deed of conveyance made earlier. For the sake
of convenience, we are inclined to narrate the brief facts in each case. After the
matters were listed before the Full bench, the writ appeal in W.A(MD)No.800
of 2022 is also posted before this Bench, as the issue arise for consideration is
within the scope of reference.
This writ petition is filed for quashing the registration of cancellation
of the settlement deed executed by the third respondent, dated 12.03.2015,
registered as Document No.7001/2015 on the file of the second respondent.
The writ petitioner is the daughter of the third respondent. The father
of the writ petitioner executed a settlement deed in favour of the writ petitioner
W.P.(MD).Nos.6889,8330,13297 of 2020,11674 of 2015
and W.A(MD)No.800 of 2022
and her sister by name Sathiya, in respect of an extent of 55 cents, out of the
total extent of 3.38 acres owned by the third respondent in S.Nos.39/5, 39/6,
39/7 and 39/16 in Thiruvudaiyarpatti Village, Thiruppathur Taluk, Sivagangai
District. The settlement deed dated 06.03.2015 was registered on the file of the
second respondent as Document No.625 of 2015. As per the recitals, purely out
of love and affection, the settlement deed was executed and there was no
condition attached to the gift. It is stated that the petitioner was given joint patta
along with her sister and that the settlement deed had been acted upon.
However, the second respondent cancelled the settlement deed and the said
cancellation deed was registered as Document No.701/2015. In the cancellation
deed, it is recited that the settlement deed was not acted upon and that the
settlor decided to cancel the settlement deed as the settlement deed is not
necessary. To quash the registration of deed of cancellation, cancelling the
Registered settlement deed earlier executed by the third respondent, the writ
petition is filed.
When the first writ petition filed by the petitioner in W.P(MD)No.
11674 of 2015 is pending, the Revenue Divisional Officer, Devakottai/first
respondent in W.P(MD)No.6889 of 2020, issued notice to the writ petitioner to
hold an enquiry on the petition filed by the petitioner's father viz.,
W.P.(MD).Nos.6889,8330,13297 of 2020,11674 of 2015
and W.A(MD)No.800 of 2022
Maruthappan. After holding an enquiry, the Revenue Divisional Officer, passed
an order on 28.08.2018, directing the cancellation of settlement deed executed
by the father of the writ petitioner in favour of the writ petitioner and her sister
on 06.03.2015. The Revenue Divisional Officer, directed the cancellation of
patta in favour of the writ petitioner and to restore the revenue records in the
name of the second respondent in the writ petition, who is none other than the
father of the writ petitioner. The impugned order was passed by the Revenue
Divisional officer in exercise of his power under Section 23 of the Maintenance
and Welfare of Parents and Senior Citizens Act, 2007. Challenging the order,
W.P(MD)No.6889 of 2020 is filed.
This writ petition is filed for issuance of a Writ of Mandamus to
declare the deed of cancellation dated 07.01.2009 executed by the third
respondent in the writ petition and registered on the file of the second
respondent as Document No.32 of 2009 as null and void and consequently to
direct the second respondent to release the deed of partition, dated 23.06.2020
registered as Document No.975 of 2020.
The petitioner in the writ petition is a minor represented by her
grandmother, who is the wife of the third respondent. It is the case of the writ
petitioner that the third respondent executed a registered gift deed dated
W.P.(MD).Nos.6889,8330,13297 of 2020,11674 of 2015
and W.A(MD)No.800 of 2022
01.08.1995 in favour of his two minor daughters viz., Ilavarasi and Malar @
Thangamalar. The said document was registered as Document No.777 of 1995
before the second respondent/Sub Registrar. From the recitals of settlement
deed, it is seen that the settlement deed is absolute and executed out of love and
affection and the settlement deed is not subject to condition. Since the
daughters of the third respondent were minors at the time of settlement deed,
the wife of the third respondent viz., the mother of settlees was appointed as
guardian for the properties settled. The settlement deed is, in respect of 1 acres
16 cents of the land and a residential building in Babinayakkanpatti Village,
Peraiyur Taluk, Madurai District. The case of the writ petitioner is that the
settlees are in possession and enjoyment of the property and patta was also
issued in the name of minor daughters. Both the daughters of the third
respondent were given a marriage. However, the elder daughter of settlor by
name Ilavarasi died intestate leaving behind her husband by name Ramar and
her daughter by name Prabha Devi, the minor writ petitioner. Stating that the
settlement deed executed by the third respondent dated 01.08.1995 is
irrevocable and that the writ petitioner came to know about the unilateral
cancellation deed only, when the grandmother of the petitioner approached the
second respondent/Sub Registrar concerned to release the document viz., a
deed of partition, dated 23.06.2020 which was also registered as document No.
W.P.(MD).Nos.6889,8330,13297 of 2020,11674 of 2015
and W.A(MD)No.800 of 2022
This writ petition is filed for issuance of a writ of Mandamus to direct
the respondents to revoke the settlement deed in document No.941/2018 dated
05.12.2018 executed by him in favour of his son Senthur, by considering his
representation of the petitioner, dated 28.06.2020.
Seventy Years old writ petitioner states that he is living in a pathetic
condition without any source of income. It is his case that the son approached
him to execute a registered gift deed to construct a house and that he would
take care of all his basic necessities at present as well in future. In short, the
writ petitioner states that believing his son's sugarcoated words, he executed the
settlement deed in respect of his only property with a hope that his son would
take care of him. It is also alleged that the petitioner was driven out from the
house by his son. Since his son has failed to provide a single meal to the
petitioner and has beaten him on few occasions, the petitioner submitted a
representation to the Inspector General of Registration and a copy marked to
the District Registrar, to cancel the Registration of the settlement deed. The
petitioner's request before the respondents was that the petitioner's son had
obtained a settlement deed fraudulently. It is stated in the representation that his
complaint before the police station was not enquired properly and contended
W.P.(MD).Nos.6889,8330,13297 of 2020,11674 of 2015
and W.A(MD)No.800 of 2022
that the possession of the property is with the writ petitioner. It is pertinent to
mention that the person interested viz., the petitioner's son in whose favour the
settlement deed was executed is not impleaded in the writ petition.
3.5 W.A(MD)No.800 of 2022
The writ appeal was listed earlier before the Division Bench
consisting of one of the members of this Bench. After admitting the writ appeal,
the Bench was of this view that the appeal can be heard along with the batch of
cases posted before the Full Bench. At the request of the Division Bench, to list
the matter before the Full Bench, after getting appropriate orders from the
Hon'ble Administrative Judge, the above writ appeal is also posted, as directed
by the Hon'ble Mr. Justice P.N.Prakash, the Hon'ble Administrative Judge, to
club the appeal along with batch of cases.
The above writ appeal is filed by the fourth respondent in the writ
petition in W.P(MD)No.8070 of 2016 challenging the order of learned Single
Judge allowing the writ petition, by order dated 22.04.2021. The writ petition
was filed, by a minor represented by his mother viz., A.Vellaiammal @ Selvi,
for issuance of a writ of mandamus directing the respondents 1 to 3 to strike off
the registration of document bearing No.734/2014 dated 14.03.2014 on the file
of the third respondent viz., Sub Registrar, Ponnamaravathy, Pudukottai
District. In the affidavit filed in support of the writ petition, the guardian of
W.P.(MD).Nos.6889,8330,13297 of 2020,11674 of 2015
and W.A(MD)No.800 of 2022
minor/writ petitioner stated that the appellant is her husband and that the writ
petitioner is the son of the appellant. It is her case that by an irrevocable
registered gift deed dated 17.08.2012, the appellant settled a residential house
and landed property measuring 5807 sq.feet, in favour of his son viz., the writ
petitioner and the said settlement deed was registered on the file of the third
respondent as Document No.1834/2012. In the gift deed, the recitals are to the
effect that the document is irrevocable and that the appellant has no right over
the property. It is stated by the writ petitioner that the gift had been duly
accepted and acted upon and original gift deed was also handed over to the
mother, as guardian of the minor. However, the gift dated 17.08.2012 executed
by the appellant was cancelled by a deed of cancellation dated 14.03.2014 and
the same was also registered as Document No.734/2014. When notice was
issued to appellant in the writ petition, it was returned with an endorsement
“person not found”. The learned Single Judge then proceeded to hear the writ
petition on merits. Finding that the unilateral cancellation of settlement deed is
not permissible in law, the learned Single Judge allowed the writ petition
holding that such cancellation of registered instrument can be done only by a
civil Court and that the registration of unilateral cancellation deed is null and
void. After declaring the cancellation of settlement deed as null and void, the
learned Single Judge affirmed the title of the writ petitioner and directed the
W.P.(MD).Nos.6889,8330,13297 of 2020,11674 of 2015
and W.A(MD)No.800 of 2022
Sub-Registrar to make necessary entries in the book. The appellant thereafter
filed a review application in Rev.Aplw(MD)No.17 of 2022 and the same was
also dismissed holding that the grievance of the appellant that he was not heard
before passing the order in the writ petition, cannot be a ground on which a
review would lie. As against the order of the learned Single Judge allowing the
writ petition, the above writ appeal is filed. In the appeal, it is contended by the
appellant that the writ petitioner's mother was joined as a Nurse in his hospital
and the writ petitioner was born to her through her husband one Raja @
Athappan. It is his case that the writ petitioner's mother obtained his signature
on coercion and she had registered the same as settlement deed by showing the
writ petitioner as his son fraudulently. Since the writ petition was decided
without hearing him, it is alleged that the order in the writ petition is vitiated as
no notice was served. It is stated that the appellant is a well known Doctor
running a hospital with 100 employees and the endorsement “no such person is
found” is unacceptable.
4.On the first hearing, this Court appointed Mr.J.Barathan, (Enrol.No.
1173/1996, Chamber No.7, Madurai Bench, Cell No.9842135588) learned
counsel practicing in this Court, to assist this Court as Amicus Curiae. We also
permitted a few other counsels whose matters are not before this Full Bench,
W.P.(MD).Nos.6889,8330,13297 of 2020,11674 of 2015
and W.A(MD)No.800 of 2022
but are interested in view of pendency of other cases, in which the question
referred to the Bench arises for consideration.
5.Mr.Vallinayagam, learned Senior Counsel and Mr.Barathan, learned
counsel has made elaborate submissions by referring to a few provisions of
Transfer of Property Act, the Societies Registration Act, the Registration Act,
Indian Penal Code and Tamil Nadu Patta Pass Book Act etc. Other counsels
have also made their submissions on the merits of the individual cases.
Mr.Mahaboob Athiff, learned counsel appearing for petitioner in W.P.(MD)No.
6889 of 2020 and W.P(MD)No.11674 of 2015 made submission placing
reliance on a few decisions of High Court of Kerala distinguishing the
judgment of Hon'ble Supreme Court in Satya Pal Anand's case. The learned
counsels have made their submissions placing reliance on several precedents
which we have discussed in this judgment.
6.The learned Additional Advocate General appearing for the Official
respondents in all these matters submitted his arguments strictly in relation to
the reference. However, he expressed his concern before this Court and
requested not to expand the scope of reference. Considering the order of
reference, this Court has to deal with related issues which are connected and
W.P.(MD).Nos.6889,8330,13297 of 2020,11674 of 2015
and W.A(MD)No.800 of 2022
inevitable. However, we are not inclined to decide any matter relating to the
validity of any administrative instructions or circulars or notifications that are
issued by the Government or the Inspector General of Registration to prevent
fraudulent registration or issues relating thereto.
7.Mr.P.Ganapthi Subramanian, learned counsel appearing for the
appellant in W.A(MD)No.8330 of 2020, relied upon the judgment of the
Hon'ble Supreme Court in Satya Pal Anand case, in support of his arguments.
8.The learned counsel nominated as Amicus Curiae as well as
Mr.M.Mahaboob Athiff, learned counsel appearing for the petitioner in two
cases and Mr.Vallinayagam, learned Senior Counsel submitted that the
judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Satya Pal Anand's case reported in
(2016) 10 SCC 767, has been considered by various High Courts and Hon'ble
Supreme Court in other cases and that the said judgment need not be considered
as a precedent in the cases on hand, in view of the specific provisions under the
Registration Act as amended by the State of Tamil Nadu and the Rule that was
framed by the Inspector General of Registration as approved by the State
W.P.(MD).Nos.6889,8330,13297 of 2020,11674 of 2015
and W.A(MD)No.800 of 2022
9.Since the reference is based on conflicting judgments , this Court is
inclined to consider the precedents cited by the counsels. Very same issue was
considered by a Full Bench of this Court earlier in the case of Latif Estate Line
India Ltd.,-vs-Hadeeja Ammal and others reported in AIR 2011(Mad)66.
Reference to the facts of this case is necessary for understanding the principles
laid down by this Bench.
10.The writ petitioner therein purchased certain properties by a
registered sale deed dated 13.11.1996 from the second respondent in the writ
petition. However, seller unilaterally executed the cancellation of sale deed on
27.08.2007 and the same was registered by the Sub-Registrar as Document No.
16826 of 2007. Writ Petition was filed                 challenging the Registration of
Unilateral cancellation of sale deed. Writ Petition was allowed by holding that
Registration of a deed of cancellation,Unilaterally executed by the vendors to
nullify the earlier sale validly made is not sustainable by referring to S.32A of
Registration Act, The order is challenged in W.A.No.938 of 2009. Similar
Appeal filed in W.A.No. 592 of 2009 arising out of identical facts was also
referred to the Full Bench as the correctness of judgment of another Division
Bench in W.A.No.194 of 2009 was doubted. The questions formulated by the
Bench for reference are as follows:
W.P.(MD).Nos.6889,8330,13297 of 2020,11674 of 2015
and W.A(MD)No.800 of 2022
(i) Whether the cancellation of a registration of a registered sale deed
of a immovable property having valuation of more than one hundred rupees can
be registered either under Section 17 or 18 or any other provision of the
(ii) Whether for such cancellation of a registered sale deed, signature
of person claiming under the document for sale of property is required to sign
the document, if no such stipulation is made under the Act ? And
(iii) Whether the decisions of the Single Judge dated 10.02.2009
made in W.P.No.8567 of 2008 and the Division Bench dated 1.04.2009 made in
W.A.No. 194 of 2009 amount to amending the provisions of the Registration
Act and the Rules framed there under,by inserting a clause for extinguishing
right, title or interest of a person on an immovable property of value more than
Rs.100/- in a manner not prescribed under the Rules?
Despite the position that Section 22 A as it is available today in the
Registration Act, was not available in the book, the Hon'ble Full                        Bench
considered the issues and held as follows:
52. Now the question that falls for consideration is as to
whether once a sale is made absolute by transfer of ownership of
the property from the vendor to the purchaser, such transfer can
be annulled or cancelled by the vendor by executing a deed of
cancellation. This question came up for consideration before the
W.P.(MD).Nos.6889,8330,13297 of 2020,11674 of 2015
and W.A(MD)No.800 of 2022
four Judges of the Privy Council (Viscount Haldane, Lord
Phillimore, Sir John Edge and Sir Robert Stout) in Md. Ihtishan
Ali v. Jamna Prasad reported in MANU/PR/0081/1921 : AIR 1922
PC 56. The fact of that case was that one Ehsan Ali Khan, being
in possession of a bazaar called Ehsaganj mortgaged it to one
Sheo Prasad by a mortgage deed dated 9th November, 1873 and
further encumbered it with charges in favour of the mortgagee. In
the year 1882, the said Ehsan Ali sold the property, subject to the
mortgage and charges to the Appellant's predecessors in title.
Dispute arose with regard to the devolution of interest, and said
Ehsan Ali cancelled the deed and retained his interest and that he,
in fact, dealt with it subsequently by further charges in favour of
the mortgagee and by professing to sell it over again to Wasi-uz-
Zaman. While deciding the issue, His Lordship Lord Phillimore,
speaking for the Bench, observed and held as under: (page 58)
While making these comments, their Lordships reserve
their opinion as to the value of a defence founded upon such a
trans Section ion as the Defendants set up. Certainly in law, no
title would pass under it, for immovable property of this value can
only be transferred by a registered deed, and when a deed of sale
has been once executed and registered, it can only be avoided by a
subsequent registered transfer. Whether in some form of suit( not
this one) between some parties any equitable relief could be got
out of such a transaction, it is unnecessary to pronounce, for in
their Lordships' opinion it was not proved.
As to the alleged subsequent dealings by Ehsan Ali
Khan with the property, they could not, if regarded as
W.P.(MD).Nos.6889,8330,13297 of 2020,11674 of 2015
and W.A(MD)No.800 of 2022
declarations in his own favour, be received in evidence on behalf
of those claiming under him, any more than they could be received
if he were himself the Defendant. They could not be regarded as
acts of ownership so as to prove adverse possession, because he
never was in possession, the possession remaining in the
mortgagee.
53. A similar question came up for consideration before
the Orissa High Court in the case of Michhu Kuanr and Ors v.
Raghu Jena and Ors. reported in MANU/OR/0007/1961 : AIR
1961 Ori 19, as to the effect of cancellation of sale deed by the
vendor on the allegation that consideration amount was not paid.
While considering the question the Bench observed:
The question of intention could only arise if no consideration
passed in the context of this back ground and the surrounding
circumstances the subsequent deed of cancellation is irrelevant.
Once by the registered sale deed Ex. 1 title had passed to the
vendees, the subsequent deed of cancellation Ex.A certainly could
not nullify the effect of the already completed sale deed Ex.1.
54. There is no provision in the Transfer of Property Act
or in the Registration Act, which deals with the cancellation of
deed of sale. The reason according to us is that the execution of a
deed of cancellation by the vendor does not create, assign, limit or
extinguish any right, title or interest in the immovable property
and the same has no effect in the eye of law. A provision relating
to the cancellation of a document is provided in Section 31 of the
Specific Relief Act, 1963 (Old Section 39). Section 31 reads as
W.P.(MD).Nos.6889,8330,13297 of 2020,11674 of 2015
and W.A(MD)No.800 of 2022
(1) Any person against whom a written instrument is
void or void able, and who has reasonable apprehension that such
instrument, if left out standing, may cause him serious injury, may
sue to have it adjudged void or void able, and the Court may, in
its discretion, so adjudge it and order it to be delivered up and
cancelled.
(2) If the instrument has been registered under the
Indian Registration Act, 1908 (16 of 1908), the Court shall also
send a copy of its decree to the officer in whose office the
instrument has been so registered; and such officer shall note on
the copy of the instrument contained in his books the fact of its
cancellation.
55. From the reading of the aforesaid provision, it is
manifest that three conditions are requisite for the exercise of
jurisdiction to cancel an instrument ie.,
(1)An instrument is avoidable against the Plaintiff;
(2)The Plaintiff may reasonably apprehend serious
injury by the instrument being left or outstanding; and (3)In the
circumstances of the case, the Court considers it proper to grant
this relief of preventive justice.
56. A Full Bench of the Madras High Court in the case
of      Muppudathi         Pillai    v.      Krishnaswami            Pillai
MANU/TN/0455/1959 : AIR 1960 Mad 1 elaborately discussed the
provision of Section 39 (New Section 31) and held:
12. The principle is that such document though not
necessary to be set aside may, if left outstanding, be a source of
W.P.(MD).Nos.6889,8330,13297 of 2020,11674 of 2015
and W.A(MD)No.800 of 2022
potential mischief. The jurisdiction under Section 39 is, therefore,
a protective or a preventive one. It is not confined to a case of
fraud, mistake, undue influence, etc. and as it has been stated it
was to prevent a document to remain as a menace and danger to
the party against whom under different circumstances it might
have operated. A party against whom a claim under a document
might be made is not bound to wait till the document is used
against him. If that were so he might be in a disadvantageous
position if the impugned document is sought to be used after the
evidence attending its execution has disappeared. Section 39
embodies the principle by which he is allowed to anticipate the
danger and institute a suit to cancel the document and to deliver it
up to him. The principle of the relief is the same as inquiatimet
actions.
57. There is no dispute that a third party can claim title
to the property against the purchaser who purchased the property
for valuable consideration and came into possession of the same.
But it is the Civil Court of competent jurisdiction to give such
declaration in favour of the third party or a stranger.
58. It can also not be overlooked or ignored that a
unilateral cancellation of a sale deed by registered instrument at
the instance of the vendor only encourages fraud and is against
public policy. But there are circumstances where a deed of
cancellation presented by both the vendor and the purchaser for
registration has to be accepted by the Registrar if other
mandatory requirements are complied with. Hence, the vendor by
W.P.(MD).Nos.6889,8330,13297 of 2020,11674 of 2015
and W.A(MD)No.800 of 2022
the unilateral execution of the cancellation deed cannot annul a
registered document duly executed by him as such an act of the
vendor is opposed to public policy.
59. After giving our anxious consideration on the
questions raised in the instant case, we come to the following
(i) A deed of cancellation of a sale unilaterally executed
by the transferor does not create, assign, limit or extinguish any
right, title or interest in the property and is of no effect. Such a
document does not create any encumbrance in the property
already transferred. Hence such a deed of cancellation cannot be
accepted for registration.
(ii) Once title to the property is vested in the transferee
by the sale of the property, it cannot be divested unto the
transferor by execution and registration of a deed of cancellation
even with the consent of the parties. The proper course would be
to re-convey the property by a deed of conveyance by the
transferee in favour of the transferor.
(iii) Where a transfer is effected by way of sale with the
condition that title will pass on payment of consideration, and
such intention is clear from the recital in the deed, then such
instrument or sale can be cancelled by a deed of cancellation with
the consent of both the parties on the ground of non-payment of
consideration. The reason is that in such a sale deed, admittedly,
the title remained with the transferor.
(iv) In other cases, a complete and absolute sale can be
cancelled at the instance of the transferor only by taking recourse
W.P.(MD).Nos.6889,8330,13297 of 2020,11674 of 2015
and W.A(MD)No.800 of 2022
to the Civil Court by obtaining a decree of cancellation of sale
deed on the ground inter alia of fraud or any other valid reasons.
11.The question of maintainability             of writ petition as against
unilateral cancellation            and registration of such cancellation deed was
considered by Hon'ble Supreme Court and it was held that there was no need
for the parties to approach the civil court as the cancellation deed was wholly
void and           non est in Thota Ganga Lakshmi Vs Government of Andhra
Pradesh reported in (2010)15 SCC 207. The relevant portion of the judgment
“...4.In our opinion, there was no need for the
Appellants to approach the civil Court as the said
cancellation deed dated 4.8.2005 as well as registration of
the same was wholly void and non est and can be ignored
altogether. For illustration, if 'A' transfers a piece of land
to 'B' by a registered sale deed, then, if it is not disputed
that 'A' had -the title to the land, that title passes to 'B' on
the registration of the sale deed (retrospectively from the
date of the execution of the same) and 'B' then becomes
the owner of the land. If 'A' wants to subsequently get the
sale deed cancelled, he has to file a civil suit for
cancellation or else he can request 'B' to sell the land back
to 'A' but by no stretch of imagination, can a cancellation
deed be executed or registered. This is unheard of in law.
W.P.(MD).Nos.6889,8330,13297 of 2020,11674 of 2015
and W.A(MD)No.800 of 2022
5. In this connection, we may also refer to Rule 26(i)(k)
relating to Andhra Pradesh under Section 69 of the
Registration Act, which states:
The registering officer shall ensure at the time of
preparation for registration of cancellation deeds of
previously registered deed of conveyances on sale before
him that such cancellation deeds are executed by all the
executant and claimant parties to the previously registered
conveyance on sale and that such cancellation deed is
accompanied by a declaration showing natural consent or
orders of a competent civil or High Court or State or
Central Government annulling the transaction contained
in the previously registered deed of conveyance on sale:
Provided that the registering officer shall dispense with
the execution of cancellation deeds by executant and
claimant parties to the previously registered deeds of
conveyances on sale before him if the cancellation deed is
executed by a Civil Judge or a Government Officer
competent to execute Government orders declaring the
properties   contained     in  the    previously       registered
conveyance on sale to be Government or Assigned or
Endowment lands or properties not register able by any
provision of law.
observations we have made above. It is only when a sale
deed is cancelled by a competent Court that the
cancellation deed can be registered and that too after
W.P.(MD).Nos.6889,8330,13297 of 2020,11674 of 2015
and W.A(MD)No.800 of 2022
notice to the concerned parties. In this case, neither is
there any declaration by a competent Court nor was there
any notice to the parties. Hence, this rule also makes it
clear that both the cancellation deed as well as
registration thereof were wholly void and non est and
meaningless transactions.
12.Mr. Baradan learned Counsel relied upon a judgment of a
Division Bench of High Court of Kerala in the case of P.A.Hamsa Vs The
District Registrar General and Ors dated 20.07.2011 in W.A.No.990 of 2011.
It is to be noted that the view of Full Bench of this Court in Latif Estate's case
was approved by the Division Bench after taking note of the fact that the view
of the Full Bench of Andhra Pradesh High Court in Yanala Malleshwari Vs
Anarithula Sayamma, which was directly in conflict with the Full Bench of
our High Court in Latif Estate's case was held to be no more good law by
Hon'ble Supreme Court in Civil Appeal No.317 of 2007.
13.Recently, another Division Bench of High Court of Kerala
considered identical issue in Santhosh Anotonio S.Netto vs Joshy Thomas and
others, reported in 2020 SCC Online Ker 2001 : (2020) 3 KLJ 230. Following
the earlier judgment of Division Bench of High Court of Kerala in P.A.Hamsa's
W.P.(MD).Nos.6889,8330,13297 of 2020,11674 of 2015
and W.A(MD)No.800 of 2022
case, the judgment of Hon'ble Supreme Court in Thota Ganga Lakshmi and
another vs Government of Andra Pradesh reported in (2010) 15 SCC 207 and
the judgment of Full Bench of this Court in the case of Latif Estate Life India
Limited, the Division Bench of High Court of Kerala led by Hon'ble Mr.Justice
Manikumar.J, reiterated the same view while confirming the judgment of
learned Single Judge of that Court allowing the Writ Petition to quash the
registration of cancellation of sale deeds on the ground that the Writ Petitioner
had not paid the sale consideration and possession of the property has not been
given. It is pertinent to mention that the Division Bench of High Court of
Kerala has also referred to the judgment of Hon'bls Supreme Court in Satya Pal
Anand case reported in (2016) 10 SCC 767 but distinguished the same in the
“12. Even though learned counsel for the appellant has
invited our attention to the judgment of the Apex Court in Satyapal
Anand v. State of Madhya Pradesh & Ors. MANU/SC/1359/2016 :
(2016 (4) KLT SN 81 (C. No. 96) SC : (2016) 10 SCC 767) to
canvass the proposition that, the Writ Petition cannot be
entertained in the facts and circumstances of the case on hand, and
the course open to the writ petitioner was to approach the civil
court to adjudicate the issue, on an analysis of the issue considered
by the Apex Court, we are of the view that, the said judgment has
no application to the issue at hand, since the question considered
thereunder was whether, the petitioner who has approached the
W.P.(MD).Nos.6889,8330,13297 of 2020,11674 of 2015
and W.A(MD)No.800 of 2022
statutory authority under S. 64 of the M.P. Co-operative Societies
Act, 1960 and the authority under the Registration Act, was right
in approaching the High Court under Article 226 after dismissal of
the application by the Registrar under the Registration Act? It was
answered in the fact scenario that the Writ Petition filed during the
pendency of the adjudication of dispute under S. 64 of M.P. Co-
operative Societies Act, 1960 is not a remedy rightly pursued by
the petitioner. Therefore, in our view, the proposition of law laid
down thereunder has some similarity to the issue of unilateral
cancellation of a registered document, it has no application to the
intrinsic fact and situation involved in this case.”
14.Very recently, the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Veena
Singh (Dead) through Lrs vs District Registrar / Additional Collector and
another reported in (2022) 7 SCC 1, considered the scope of Section 35 and
Sections 72 to 76 of Registration Act. Since the judgment of 3 Members Bench
of Hon'ble Supreme Court in Satya Pal Anand case is also considered in this
case by a Co-equal Bench, this Court deems it fit to refer the said judgment in
the present context with reference to facts.
15.The appellant before the Hon'ble Supreme Court jointly owned a
vacant land admeasuring 3793 sq.yd along with his daughter and son.
Appellant's daughter and son executed a power of attorney deed on 17.04.2010
W.P.(MD).Nos.6889,8330,13297 of 2020,11674 of 2015
and W.A(MD)No.800 of 2022
in favour of the appellant which was stated to be cancelled on 27.09.2011. The
appellant was alleged to have entered into two agreements with a developer, the
second respondent before Hon'ble Supreme Court. The first is a development
agreement in respect of 1000 sq.meters in the front portion and the second is an
agreement to sell an area admeasuring 839.4sq.meter in the rear portion for a
sale consideration of Rs.1.6 crores.     A sale deed purported to have been
executed by the appellant in favour of second respondent was presented for
registration on 15.12.2011.    The appellant raised objection for registering
document alleging fraud against second respondent in getting her signature in
an incomplete sale deed, dated 20.06.2011. By an order, dated 17.02.2012, the
Sub Registrar declined to register the sale deed after recording the statement of
appellant that the second respondent got her signature forcibly. The second
respondent preferred an appeal under Section 72 of Registration Act before the
District Registrar who set aside the Sub Registrar's decision and ordered the
registration of the sale deed (which was duly registered on 16.04.2012).
Meanwhile, a criminal complaint was lodged by appellant for offences
punishable under Sections 420, 467, 468 and 471 of IPC which was closed as a
civil dispute.   In the said circumstances, appellant filed a Writ Petition
challenging the order of District Registrar. The same was dismissed by Writ
Court, following the judgment of Hon'ble Supreme Court in Satya Pal Anand
W.P.(MD).Nos.6889,8330,13297 of 2020,11674 of 2015
and W.A(MD)No.800 of 2022
vs State of Madya Pradesh and held that the Sub Registrar under Section 35
did not have the power to conduct an inquiry regarding execution of the sale
deed.          The appellant was granted leave to move the Civil Court for a
declaration that the sale deed had been obtained by fraud. Considering the
grounds raised by the appellant to cancel the registration and the scope and
object of the provisions under Sections 72 to 76 of Registration Act, the
Hon'ble Supreme Court has held as follows:
“Section 73 of the Registration Act envisages that an
application may be submitted to the Registrar by a person in order
to establish their rights to have a document registered, in a situation
where the Sub-Registrar has refused to register the document on the
ground that the person by whom it purports to have been executed
has denied its execution. Section 74 then lays down the procedure
which is to be followed by the Registrar, which contemplates an
enquiry by the Registrar into whether the document has been
executed and whether requirements of law for the time being in force
have been complied with on the part of the Applicant or the person
presenting    the   document    for   registration.      When      the    twin
requirements of clauses (a) and (b) of Section 74 are found by the
Registrar to have been fulfilled, Sub-section (1) of Section 75
provides that the Registrar shall order the document be registered.
81.Sub-section (4) of Section 75 stipulates that for the
purpose of the enquiry Under Section 74, the Registrar may summon
and enforce the attendance of witnesses and compel them to give
W.P.(MD).Nos.6889,8330,13297 of 2020,11674 of 2015
and W.A(MD)No.800 of 2022
evidence as if he is a civil court. The Registrar is also empowered to
impose the obligation of paying the costs of the enquiry on a party,
and such costs are to be recovered as if they have been charged in a
suit under the Code of Civil Procedure. Thus, Sub-section (4) of
Section 75 incorporates a deeming fiction from two perspectives -
first, in empowering the Registrar to summon and enforce the
attendance of witnesses and for compelling them to give evidence
"as if he were a civil court"; and second, in awarding costs which
become recoverable "as if they have been awarded in a suit" under
the Code of Civil Procedure.
82.The process which is conducted by the Registrar for the
purpose of an enquiry Under Section 74 cannot be equated to the
powers of the civil court, though certain powers which are entrusted
to a civil court are vested with the Registrar by the provisions of
Section 75(4). A quasi-judicial function is entrusted to the Registrar
for the purpose of conducting an enquiry Under Section 74. Where
the Registrar refuses to register a document Under Sections 72 or
76, no appeal lies against such an order. Section 77, however,
provides that when the Registrar refuses to order the document to be
registered, any person claiming under such document or its
representative, assign or agents may institute a suit before the civil
court within the stipulated time for a decree directing that the
document shall be registered. It is thus clear that the Registrar, when
he conducts an enquiry Under Section 74, does not stand constituted
as a civil court. The enquiry before the Registrar is summary in
nature. The decision of the Registrar in ordering document to be
registered, or for that matter in refusing to register a document, is
W.P.(MD).Nos.6889,8330,13297 of 2020,11674 of 2015
and W.A(MD)No.800 of 2022
not conclusive and is amenable to judicial review.
83.Therefore, in a situation where an individual admits
their signature on a document but denies its execution, the Sub-
Registrar is bound to refuse registration in accordance with Sections
35(3)(a) of the Registration Act. Subsequently, if an application if
filed Under Section 73, the Registrar is entrusted with the power of
conducting an enquiry of a quasi-judicial nature Under Section 74.
If the Registrar passes an order refusing registration Under Section
76, the party presenting the document for registration has the
remedy of filing a civil suit Under Section 77 of the Registration Act,
where a competent civil court will be able to adjudicate upon the
question of fact conclusively.
84. Finally, our attention has been drawn to Section 58(2)
of the Registration Act, which stipulates as follows:
58. Particulars to be endorsed on documents admitted to
registration.-- [...]
(2) If any person admitting the execution of a document refuses to
endorse the same, the registering officer shall nevertheless register
if, but shall at the same time endorse a note of such refusal.
85.It is submitted on behalf of the second Respondent that
above provision must be read along with paragraph 241 of the UP
Registration Manual, which provides:
241. Registering officers not concerned with validity of
documents. Registering officers should bear in mind that they are in
no way concerned with the validity of documents brought to them for
registration, and that it would be wrong for them to refuse to register
on any such grounds as the following: (1) that the executants was
W.P.(MD).Nos.6889,8330,13297 of 2020,11674 of 2015
and W.A(MD)No.800 of 2022
dealing with property not belonging to him; (2) that the instrument
infringed the rights of third persons not parties to the transaction;
(3) that the transaction was fraudulent or opposed to public policy;
(4) that the executants had not agreed to certain conditions of the
document; (5) that the executants was not acquainted with the
conditions of the document; (6) that the executants declared that he
had been deceived into executing; (7) that the executants is blind
and cannot count. These and such like are matters for decision, if
necessary, by competent courts of law, and registering officers, as
such, have nothing to do with them. If the document be presented in
a proper manner, by a competent person, at the proper office, within
the time allowed by law, and if the registering officer be satisfied
that the alleged executants is the person the represents himself to be,
and if such person admits execution, the registering officer is bound
to register the document without regard to its possible effects. But
the registering officer shall make a note of such objections of the
kinds mentioned in grounds (1) to (7) above, as may by brought to
his notice in the endorsement required by Section 58.
Reliance has been placed on the above provisions of the
UP Registration Manual to highlight that an individual's refusal
predicated upon any of the above-mentioned seven grounds shall not
impact its "execution" but shall only require an endorsement Under
Section 58(2). We are inclined to disagree with this submission. For
the reasons already mentioned in the judgment, we are inclined to
accept the interpretation of the term "execution" to mean that a
person has signed a document after having fully understood it and
consented to its terms. Hence, since paragraph 241 and Section
W.P.(MD).Nos.6889,8330,13297 of 2020,11674 of 2015
and W.A(MD)No.800 of 2022
58(2) only come into the picture when execution is admitted, they are
not relevant at the present stage.
86. At this stage, it would be material to refer to a
judgment of this Court in Satya Pal Anand (supra), where the three-
judge Bench was constituted following a difference of opinion
between two Judges. In that case, the mother of the Appellant had
been allotted a plot of land by a registered deed by a cooperative
society. After her death, the cooperative society executed a deed of
extinguishment unilaterally cancelling the allotment of the plot and
executed a registered deed in favour of the fifth Respondent. The
Appellant objected to the transaction, following which a tripartite
deed of compromise was reached with the society and the fifth
Respondent. Notwithstanding this, the Appellant moved the Deputy
Registrar of Cooperative Societies. During the pendency of the
dispute, the society permitted the transfer of the plot to the sixth and
seventh Respondents. The Appellant then moved an application
before the Sub-Registrar for cancelling the registration of the deed
of extinguishment and the two subsequent deeds, but this application
was rejected by the Sub-Registrar, inter alia, on the ground that he
had no jurisdiction to cancel the registration of a registered
document. The Appellant then moved the Inspector General of
Registration Under Section 69 of the Registration Act, who rejected
the application. The writ petition filed by the Appellant before the
High Court Under Article 226, seeking a declaration of the nullity of
the deed of extinguishment and the two subsequent deeds, was also
dismissed by the High Court. In this backdrop, Justice A.M.
Khanwilkar, speaking for the three-judge Bench, observed that the
W.P.(MD).Nos.6889,8330,13297 of 2020,11674 of 2015
and W.A(MD)No.800 of 2022
Appellant had entered into a deed of compromise and accepted
valuable consideration, in spite of which he had instituted a dispute
under the Madhya Pradesh Cooperative Societies Act, 1960.
Further, pending the dispute, an application was filed by the
Appellant before the Sub-Registrar seeking the same relief of
cancellation of the registration of the deed of extinguishment and the
subsequent deeds in favour of the third party.
87.In view of these circumstances, this Court held that the
High Court was justified in declining to entertain a writ petition at
the instance of the Appellant:
“25. It is a well-established position that the remedy of
writ Under Article 226 of the Constitution of India is extraordinary
and discretionary. In exercise of writ jurisdiction, the High Court
cannot be oblivious to the conduct of the party invoking that remedy.
The fact that the party may have several remedies for the same cause
of action, he must elect his remedy and cannot be permitted to
indulge in multiplicity of actions. The exercise of discretion to issue
a writ is a matter of granting equitable relief. It is a remedy in
equity. In the present case, the High Court declined to interfere at
the instance of the Appellant having noticed the above clinching
facts. No fault can be found with the approach of the High Court in
refusing to exercise its writ jurisdiction because of the conduct of the
Appellant in pursuing multiple proceedings for the same relief and
also because the Appellant had an alternative and efficacious
statutory remedy to which he has already resorted to... „
88.Having held that the writ petition before the High
W.P.(MD).Nos.6889,8330,13297 of 2020,11674 of 2015
and W.A(MD)No.800 of 2022
Court was not maintainable for the above reasons, this Court also
observed that the role of the Sub-Registrar stood discharged once
the document had been registered, since there is no express
provision in the Registration Act which empowers him to recall the
registration. This Court held:(Satya Pal Anad Case)
“34. The role of the Sub-Registrar (Registration) stands
discharged, once the document is registered (see Raja Mohammad
Amir Ahmad Khan [State of U.P. v. Raja Mohammad Amir Ahmad
Khan, MANU/SC/0030/1961 : AIR 1961 SC 787])...There is no
express provision in the 1908 Act which empowers the Registrar to
recall such registration. The fact whether the document was properly
presented for registration cannot be reopened by the Registrar after
its registration. The power to cancel the registration is a substantive
matter. In absence of any express provision in that behalf, it is not
open to assume that the Sub-Registrar (Registration) would be
competent to cancel the registration of the documents in question.
Similarly, the power of the Inspector General is limited to do
superintendence of Registration Offices and make Rules in that
behalf. Even the Inspector General has no power to cancel the
registration of any document which has already been registered.
89.This Court in Satya Pal Anand case observed that
Section 35 of the Registration Act does not confer a quasi-judicial
power on the registering officer, who is not expected to evaluate title
or irregularity in the document. As such, the validity of the
registered deed of extinguishment could be placed in issue only
before a court of competent jurisdiction. On the above facts, this
Court upheld the dismissal of the writ petition by the High Court,
W.P.(MD).Nos.6889,8330,13297 of 2020,11674 of 2015
and W.A(MD)No.800 of 2022
with an opportunity being granted to the Appellant to pursue a
remedy in accordance with law. Therefore, the decision in Satya Pal
Anand (supra) has held that once a deed of extinguishment had been
registered by the registering officer, the registering officer had no
power to recall it nor was it amenable to the supervisory control of
the Inspector General of Registration Under Section 69 of the
90. The aforesaid decision does not deal with a situation
such as the present case, where Sub-Registrar had in the first
instance declined to order the registration of the document and the
order of the Sub-Registrar was questioned in an appeal Under
Section 72 filed by the second Respondent. The Registrar, in the
course of the appellate proceedings, purported to hold an enquiry of
the nature contemplated Under Section 74 of the Registration Act
and concluded that the execution of the sale deed had been
established and it was liable to be registered. The Registrar was
evidently seized of a case where the Sub-Registrar had declined to
order registration on the ground that the execution of the document
was denied by the Appellant Under Section 35(3)(a). While
exercising the jurisdiction pursuant to the invocation of the remedy
Under Section 72, the Registrar relied on the statements of the
scribe of the sale deed and the attesting witnesses to the effect that
the sale deed had been signed by the Appellant and that the
Appellant had also affixed her fingerprints on it. However, as rightly
pointed out by the Appellant, the signing of the sale deed by her and
the affixation of her fingerprints is not in dispute. The real issue is
W.P.(MD).Nos.6889,8330,13297 of 2020,11674 of 2015
and W.A(MD)No.800 of 2022
whether there was due execution of the sale deed by the Appellant.
91.The Appellant in the course of her objections
specifically pleaded fraud, submitting that:
(i) The area which was reflected in the sale deed which
was presented for registration was at variance that what had
actually been agreed between the parties;
(ii) The boundaries as reflected in the sale deed did not
correspond with the land agreed to be sold;
(iii) The sale consideration was seriously undervalued;
(iv) The purported sale deed was resulting not only in the
transfer of excessive land but also the residential house which was
in occupation of the Appellant after the death of her husband; and
(v) The full consideration payable under the terms of the
transaction had not been received by the Appellant.
92.The plea of the Appellant, that the purported sale deed
though signed by her was procured by fraud and undue influence,
was a matter which raised a serious substantive dispute. In support
of her contentions, the Appellant has also adduced before us the
inspection report by the Sub-Registrar and the Naib Tahsildar.
However, we are inclined to hold that we cannot decide on the merits
of the dispute at this stage, since the Registrar clearly exceeded his
jurisdiction by adjudicating on the issue of fraud and undue
influence.
93. The Registrar purported to exercise the powers
conferred Under Section 74 and arrived at a finding that the sale
deed had been duly signed by the Appellant and was therefore liable
to be registered. However, the objections of the Appellant raised
W.P.(MD).Nos.6889,8330,13297 of 2020,11674 of 2015
and W.A(MD)No.800 of 2022
serious issues of a triable nature which could only have been
addressed before and adjudicated upon by a court of competent civil
jurisdiction. As a matter of fact, during the course of the hearing,
this Court has been apprised of the fact that in respect of the
remaining area of 1000 square meters in the front portion of the
land, a suit for specific performance27 has been instituted by the
second Respondent, resulting in a decree for specific performance
dated 16 November 2018. As regards the subject matter of the sale
deed, the second Respondent has instituted a suit for possession
before the Civil Judge, Senior Division Fast Track Court28, where
certain proceedings are pending. In this view of the matter, we are
clearly of the opinion that the Registrar in the present case acted
contrary to law by directing the sale deed to be registered.
94. In the impugned judgment, the Single Judge of the
Allahabad High Court has observed that registration does not
depend upon the consent of the executant but on the Registrar's
finding that the executant had actually signed the document. The
High Court held that having found in the course of the enquiry that
the sale deed was duly prepared by a scribe, that the attesting
witness had stated that the sale deed was signed by the Appellant
and she also placed her fingerprints in their presence, it was open to
the Registrar to direct registration in spite of a denial of its
execution by the Appellant. In doing so, the Single Judge of the High
Court has, with respect, conflated the mere signing of the sale deed
with its execution. For the reasons mentioned earlier in this
judgment, such an approach is completely erroneous and cannot be
upheld.
W.P.(MD).Nos.6889,8330,13297 of 2020,11674 of 2015
and W.A(MD)No.800 of 2022
95. For the above reasons, we allow the appeal and set
aside the impugned judgment and order of the Single Judge of the
High Court of Judicature at Allahabad dated 31 May 2018 in the
Appellant's writ petition. The order passed by the District Registrar
on 31 March 2012 shall, in the circumstances, stand set aside.
However, it is clarified that the present judgment shall not affect any
of the civil/criminal proceedings that are pending in respect of the
subject matter of the transaction. In the circumstances of the case,
there shall be no order as to costs.”
16.In the above judgment, the Hon'ble Supreme Court has considered
the scope of enquiry by the District Registrar when the Sub-Registrar had
refused to register a document on the ground of denial of execution. In that
context, the Hon'ble Supreme Court also distinguished the judgment of Hon'ble
Supreme Court in Satya Pal Anand case by saying that on account of pendency
of dispute under the provisions of M.P. Co.Operative Societies Act, 1960, the
Hon'ble Supreme Court was justified in declining to entertain a Writ Petition at
the instance of the appellant.
17.It is to be noted that the judgment of Division bench in the case of
P.Rukumani and others vs. Amudhavalli and others reported in 2020(1) CTC
W.P.(MD).Nos.6889,8330,13297 of 2020,11674 of 2015
and W.A(MD)No.800 of 2022
241 was also confirmed by the Ho'ble Supreme Court in Civil Appeal No.7464
of 2021 in Amudhavalli and others vs. P.Rukumani and others by judgment
dated 07.12.2021. While approving the view of Honourable Supreme Court in
the case of Thota Ganga Laxmi and another vs. Government of Andhra
Pradesh and others reported in (2010) 15 SCC 207, the Honourable Supreme
Court was not inclined to examine the validity and effect of cancellation deed
as the appellants had already filed a written statement in the civil suit in
O.S.No.142 of 2008. Though the judgement of Division Bench of this Court in
R.Rukmani's case was upheld, the law that was laid in (2010) 15 SCC 207 was
quoted with approval. The following observation of Hon'ble Supreme Court is
very important “Had the appellants not entered their appearance by filing a
written statement, it would have been a different situation.”
18.In the present context where the validity of registration of
unilateral cancellation of a registered document and the authority of sub-
registrar to register the document unilaterally cancelling a deed of conveyance
is examined, it is also relevant and useful to refer to a recent judgment of
Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Asset Reconstruction Company (India)
Limited-vs-J.P.Velayutham and ors., reported in 2022 SCC on-line SC 544. It
is a case where the validity of registration of a document of sale through power
W.P.(MD).Nos.6889,8330,13297 of 2020,11674 of 2015
and W.A(MD)No.800 of 2022
of attorney was examined. A writ petition was filed by the appellant before the
Hon'ble Supreme Court seeking a declaration that the act of the sub-registrar in
registering the sale deed executed by the power of attorney agent in favour of
his son was null and void.            Finding that the power of attorney deed shown
before the Registering authority does not authorize the power agent to sell or
encumber the property conveyed, the writ petition was allowed holding that
there was utter failure on the part of the Registering Authority to follow the
mandate of law as prescribed in Sections 32 to 35 of the Registration Act, 1908.
Two intra-Court appeals filed by the power of attorney agent as well as his son
in favour of whom the sale deed was registered were allowed. On appeal, the
Hon'ble Supreme Court considered the issue whether invocation of the writ
jurisdiction of the High Court by the appellant was right, especially when civil
suits at the instance of third parties are pending and the Hon'ble Supreme Court
had directed the parties earlier to move the civil Court in a different
proceedings arising under Section 145 of Code of Criminal Procedure.
19.After referring to the various provisions of Registration Act as
applicable to the State of Tamil Nadu, the Hon'ble Supreme Court considered
the scope of enquiry before registration by the registering officer and the scope
of judicial review in a writ petition under Article 226 of the Constitution of
W.P.(MD).Nos.6889,8330,13297 of 2020,11674 of 2015
and W.A(MD)No.800 of 2022
India questioning registration.           After noting down the three essential
steps/stages of registration of any document, the Hon'ble Supreme Court held
that the jurisdiction of the High Court under Article 226 of the Constitution is
not ousted when a party approaches the High Court, questioning the failure of
the Registering Authority to perform his statutory duties in the course of third
step (Registration). So saying the civil appeals were allowed by restoring the
order of the learned single Judge of this Court in the writ petition. The relevant
paragraphs are extracted below for convenience:
“52. Actually, the registration of a document
comprises of three essential steps among others. They are, (i)
execution of the document, by the executant signing or affixing
his left hand thumb impression; (ii) presenting the document for
registration and admitting to the Registering Authority the
execution of such document; and (iii) the act of registration of
the document.
53. In cases where a suit for title is filed, with or
without the relief of declaration that the registered document is
null and void, what gets challenged, is a combination of all the
aforesaid three steps in the process of execution and registration.
The first of the aforesaid three steps may be challenged in a suit
for declaration that the registered document is null and void,
either on the ground that the executant did not have a valid title
to pass on or on the ground that what was found in the document
W.P.(MD).Nos.6889,8330,13297 of 2020,11674 of 2015
and W.A(MD)No.800 of 2022
was not the signature of the executant or on the ground that the
signature of the executant was obtained by fraud, coercion etc.
The second step of presentation of the document and admitting
the execution of the same, may also be challenged on the very
same grounds hereinabove stated. Such objections to the first
and second of the aforesaid three steps are substantial and they
strike at the very root of creation of the document. A challenge to
the very execution of a document, is a challenge to its very DNA
and any defect or illegality on the execution, is congenital in
nature. Therefore, such a challenge, by its very nature, has to be
made only before the civil court and certainly not before the writ
court.
54. The third step namely the act of registration, is
something that the Registering Authority is called upon to do
statutorily. While the executant of the document and the person
claiming under the document (claimant) are the only actors
involved in the first two steps, the Registering Officer is the actor
in the third step. Apart from the third step which is wholly in the
domain of the Registering Authority, he may also have a role to
play in the second step when a document is presented for
registration and the execution thereof is admitted. The role that
is assigned to the Registrar in the second step is that of
verification of the identity of the person presenting the document
for registration.
55. Thus, the first two steps in the process of
registration are substantial in nature, with the parties to the
document playing the role of the lead actors and the Registering
W.P.(MD).Nos.6889,8330,13297 of 2020,11674 of 2015
and W.A(MD)No.800 of 2022
Authority playing a guest role in the second step. The third step
is procedural in nature where the Registering Authority is the
lead actor.
56. In suits for declaration of title and/or suits for
declaration that a registered document is null and void, all the
aforesaid three steps which comprise the entire process of
execution and registration come under challenge. If a party
questions the very execution of a document or the right and title
of a person to execute a document and present it for registration,
his remedy will only be to go to the civil court. But where a party
questions only the failure of the Registering Authority to perform
his statutory duties in the course of the third step, it cannot be
said that the jurisdiction of the High Court Under Article 226
stands completely ousted. This is for the reason that the writ
jurisdiction of the High Court is to ensure that statutory
authorities perform their duties within the bounds of law. It must
be noted that when a High Court, in exercise of its jurisdiction
Under Article 226 finds that there was utter failure on the part of
the Registering Authority to stick to the mandate of law, the
Court merely cancels the act of registration, but does not declare
the very execution of the document to be null and void. A
declaration that a document is null and void, is exclusively
within the domain of the civil court, but it does not mean that the
High Court cannot examine the question whether or not the
Registering Authority performed his statutory duties in the
manner prescribed by law. It is well settled that if something is
required by law to be done in a particular manner, it shall be
W.P.(MD).Nos.6889,8330,13297 of 2020,11674 of 2015
and W.A(MD)No.800 of 2022
done only in that manner and not otherwise. Examining whether
the Registering Authority did something in the manner required
by law or otherwise, is certainly within the jurisdiction of the
High Court Under Article 226. However, it is needless to say that
the High Courts may refuse to exercise jurisdiction in cases
where the violations of procedure on the part of the Registering
Authority are not gross or the violations do not shock the
conscience of the Court. Lack of jurisdiction is completely
different from a refusal to exercise jurisdiction.
57. In the case on hand, the Appellant has not sought a
declaration from the High Court that the execution of the
document in question was null and void or that there was no title
for the executant to transfer the property. The Appellant assailed
before the High Court, only the act of omission on the part of the
Registering Authority to check up whether the person who
claimed to be the power agent, had the power of conveyance and
the power of presenting the document for registration, especially
in the light to the statutory rules. Therefore, the learned Single
Judge rightly applied the law and allowed the writ petition filed
by the Appellant, but the Division Bench got carried away by the
sound and fury created by the contesting Respondents on the
basis of (i) pendency of the civil suits; (ii) findings recorded by
the Special Court for CBI cases; and (iii) the order passed by
this Court in the SLP arising out of proceedings Under Section
145 Code of Criminal Procedure.
58. Arguments were advanced on the question whether
the Registering Authority is carrying out an administrative act or
W.P.(MD).Nos.6889,8330,13297 of 2020,11674 of 2015
and W.A(MD)No.800 of 2022
a quasi-judicial act in the performance of his statutory duties.
But we think it is not relevant for determining the availability of
writ jurisdiction. If the Registering Authority is found to be
exercising a quasi-judicial power, the exercise of such a power
will still be amenable to judicial review Under Article 226,
subject to the exhaustion of the remedies statutorily available.
On the contrary if the Registering Authority is found to be
performing only an administrative act, even then the High Court
is empowered to see whether he performed the duties statutorily
ordained upon him in the manner prescribed by law.
59. Much ado was sought to be made by contending
that the Appellant approached the High Court without disclosing
the previous orders of the High Court and this Court, relegating
them to civil court for the adjudication of their claim. Reliance
was also placed in this regard on the decision of this Court in
Raj Kumar Soni v. State of U.P. MANU/SC/7271/2007 : (2007)
60. But we do not agree. The previous orders directing
the Appellant to go to the civil court arose out of the proceedings
Under Section 145 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. But it
does not mean that the recourse to civil court was seen as the
only panacea for all ills.
61. Therefore, in the light of (i) the Tamilnadu
Registration Rules discussed above; (ii) the statutory scheme of
Sections 32 to 35 of the Act as well as other provisions as
amended by the State of Tamilnadu; and (iii) the distinction
between a challenge to the first 2 steps in the process of
W.P.(MD).Nos.6889,8330,13297 of 2020,11674 of 2015
and W.A(MD)No.800 of 2022
execution of a document and the third step concerning
registration, we are of the considered view that the Division
bench of the High Court was not right in setting aside the order
of the learned single Judge. If the Registering Officer under the
Act is construed as performing only a mechanical role without
any independent mind of his own, then even Government
properties may be sold and the documents registered by
unscrupulous persons driving the parties to go to civil court.
Such an interpretation may not advance the cause of justice.
62. Therefore, in fine, the appeals are allowed, the
impugned order of the Division Bench is set aside and the order
of the learned single Judge is restored. There will be no order as
to costs.”
20.It is interesting to note that the judgment of Hon'ble Supreme
Court in Satya Pal Anand Case was also considered and explained that it does
not apply to the case on facts. Para 45 and 46 of the judgment are very
important and hence they are extracted below:
“45. The reliance placed by the Respondents on the
decision in Satya Pal Anand v. State of Madhya Pradesh
MANU/SC/1359/2016 : (2016) 10 SCC 767, is misplaced. The
decision in Satya Pal Anand (supra) arose out a case where the
allotment of a plot made by a cooperative society was cancelled
unilaterally by a deed of extinguishment, by the society. The
allottee raised a dispute which ended in a compromise but
W.P.(MD).Nos.6889,8330,13297 of 2020,11674 of 2015
and W.A(MD)No.800 of 2022
notwithstanding the compromise the allottee raised a dispute under
the relevant provisions of the Madhya Pradesh Cooperative
Societies Act, 1960. When the dispute was pending, the allottee
moved the Registering Officer for the cancellation of the deed of
transfer executed in favour of the subsequent purchasers. When the
Registering Authority refused to comply with the demand, a writ
petition was moved seeking a declaration that the deed of
extinguishment and the subsequent sales were null and void. The
High Court dismissed the writ petition on the ground that a dispute
was already pending before the competent authority under the
Cooperative Societies Act. When the order of dismissal passed by
the High Court was challenged before this Court, there was a
difference of opinion as to whether the issue was directly covered
by the decision of this Court in Thota Ganga Laxmi and Anr. v.
Government of Andhra Pradesh and Ors. MANU/SC/1267/2010 :
(2010) 15 SCC 206. Therefore, the matter was placed before a three
Judge Bench. While upholding the decision of the High Court, the
three member Bench held in Satya Pal Anand (supra) that there
was no Rule in the State of Madhya Pradesh similar to Rule 26(k)
(i) of the Rules issued by the State of Andhra Pradesh Under
Section 69 of the Registration Act, 1908 and that therefore the
decision in Thota Ganga Laxmi (supra) cannot be invoked.
46. The decision in Satya Pal Anand (supra) cannot go to
the rescue of the contesting Respondents, for the simple reason that
the writ Petitioner in that case, first accepted a compromise and
then raised a dispute under the Cooperative Societies Act (which is
akin to a civil suit) and thereafter approached the High Court
W.P.(MD).Nos.6889,8330,13297 of 2020,11674 of 2015
and W.A(MD)No.800 of 2022
Under Article 226 for a declaration, which he could have sought
only in the already instituted proceedings. The very fact that Thota
Ganga Laxmi was sought to be distinguished on the basis of the
express provision contained in the Rules of the State of A.P., would
indicate that there is no absolute bar for the High Court to exercise
jurisdiction Under Article 226.”
21.In the course of hearing, the judgment of Hon'ble Supreme Court
in the case of S.Sarojini Amma-vs-Velayudhan Pillai Sreekumar, reported in
2018(6)CTC 108 is cited. The question involved in the Appeal before Hon'ble
Supreme Court was whether a document styled as Gift deed but executed for
consideration part of which had been paid and the balance promised to be paid,
can be treated as formal document or instrument of gift. The appeal arose as
against the judgment of High Court of Kerala in a Second Appeal. Since we
are dealing with maintainability of a writ petition against unilateral cancellation
of a deed of conveyance, this judgment has no relevance in the present context.
The question before the High Court was whether the document could be a Deed
of Gift or it is in the nature of Will. Though the deed of transfer was executed
for consideration, it was found that it was subject to the condition that the
Donee would look after the donor and her husband and that the Gift would take
effect after the death of Donor. Hence, the Hon'ble Supreme Court held that
W.P.(MD).Nos.6889,8330,13297 of 2020,11674 of 2015
and W.A(MD)No.800 of 2022
there was no completed Gift and the Donor was within her right in cancelling
the Deed pointing out that no evidence in proof of acceptance and the Gift does
not become complete during life time of the Donor.
22.Recently a Division Bench of this Court headed by Hon'ble Chief
Justice in the case of N.Jeevalakshmi and another-vs-N.Maheswarman and
others, reported in 2022-3-L.W.604, considered the maintainability of writ
petition challenging unilateral cancellation of settlement deed. The Division
Bench while upholding the maintainability of writ petition, distinguished the
judgment of Hon'ble Supreme Court in Satya Pal Anand Case and specifically
held that the order of learned Single Judge allowing the writ petition is not one
going contrary to what has been held by the Apex Court. However, the Division
Bench has observed in Para 14 of the judgment that once a deed is registered by
the Sub-Registrar, he has no power to cancel it and this position is also covered
by the judgment of Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of 'Satya Pal Anad'. The
observation may not be appropriate as the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Satya Pal
Anand case has held that a writ petition for cancelling the deed of
extinguishment cancelling the previous sale deed is not maintainable.
23.Let us consider the judgment of Hon'ble Supreme Court which is
W.P.(MD).Nos.6889,8330,13297 of 2020,11674 of 2015
and W.A(MD)No.800 of 2022
the centre of controversy for different or dissenting views. The judgment of
three member Bench of Hon'ble Supreme Court in Satya Pal Anand-vs- State
of Madhyapradesh and Ors., reported in (2016) 10 SCC 767 is considered,
explained and distinguished by Hon'ble Supreme Court and High Courts in a
few judgments above referred to while examining its applicability to cases like
the present one. It will be more appropriate to consider the said judgment with
reference to facts, since the questions framed and answered by Hon'ble
Supreme Court in the above judgment should be understood in the factual
context before drawing legal inference.
24.1. A residential plot in Bhopal was allotted to the appellant's
mother Smt.Veeravali Anand by Punjabi Housing Co-operations Society Ltd.,
(hereinafter referred to as the 'Society') by a registered deed dated 22.03.1962.
24.2. Smt.Veeravali Anand died on 12.06.1988. The Society executed
a deed of extinguishment on 09.08.2001, unilaterally, cancelling the said
allotment on the ground of violation of the bye-laws of the Society in not
raising any construction on the plot within time.
24.3.On the basis of extinguishment deed the Society executed and
W.P.(MD).Nos.6889,8330,13297 of 2020,11674 of 2015
and W.A(MD)No.800 of 2022
got registered another sale deed in favour of the fifth respondent in respect of
the same plot. The appellant objected to the said transaction. However, a
compromise deed was executed where under the appellant received the
consideration of Rs.6.50 lakhs. Despite the compromise deed, the appellant
raised a dispute under Section 64 of Madhyapradesh Co-operative Societies
Act, 1960, challenging the unilateral registration of extinguishment deed in
2001 and allotting the plot in favour of fifth respondent on 24.04.2004.
24.4. During the pendency of the dispute, the Society permitted
transfer of the plot in favour of the respondents 6 and 7 by a sale deed dated
11.07.2006. Since the appellant was resorting to multiple proceedings in
relation to the plot, the Society issued a notice on 12.07.2007 asking the
appellant to return the consideration amount in furtherance of the compromise
deed. The appellant did not return the money but continued with multiple
proceedings including criminal proceedings.
24.5. The appellant thereafter filed an application before the Sub-
registrar to cancel the registration of extinguishment deed dated 09.08.2001
and the subsequent sale deeds dated 21.04.2004 and 11.07.2007. The Sub-
Registrar rejected the application on the ground that the dispute is pending
W.P.(MD).Nos.6889,8330,13297 of 2020,11674 of 2015
and W.A(MD)No.800 of 2022
adjudication and that the Sub-Registrar has no jurisdiction to cancel the
registration of a registered document. Thereafter, the appellant filed an
application under Section 69 of Registration Act, 1908 before the Inspector
General of Registration, who rejected the said application by order dated
19.09.2008. The order of Sub-Registrar and the order of Inspector General of
Registration are challenged in a writ petition where he also sought for a
declaration that the deed of extinguishment deed and subsequent sale deeds are
void ab initio and a direction to record cancellation of documents. The writ
petition was dismissed by a Division Bench of High Court of Madhyapradesh
on the ground that the appellant had already resorted to a remedy (a dispute)
before the appropriate forum under Madhyapradesh Co-operative Societies Act,
1960 and that the Sub-Registrar has no power to cancel the registered
documents.
24.6. On appeal before the Hon'ble Supreme Court, the matter was
heard by a two member Bench of Hon'ble Supreme Court. Consequent to the
difference of opinion between the two Hon'ble Judges of Division Bench, the
appeal was placed before a three member Bench in terms of order of reference
dated 25.08.2015. The larger Bench then proceeded to frame the questions to
be answered by them on the facts of the case. It is relevant to extract para 23 to
W.P.(MD).Nos.6889,8330,13297 of 2020,11674 of 2015
and W.A(MD)No.800 of 2022
Para 23.6(f) of the said judgment, which are as follows:
“23.Having     considered    the     rival     submissions,
including keeping in mind the view taken by the two learned
Judges of this Court on the matters in issue, in our opinion, the
questions to be answered by us in the fact situation of the
present case, can be formulated as under:
23.1. (a) Whether in the fact situation of the present
case, the High Court was justified in dismissing the Writ
23.2. (b) Whether the High Court in exercise of writ
jurisdiction under Article 226 of the Constitution of India is duty
bound to declare the registered Deeds (between the private
parties) as void ab initio and to cancel the same, especially
when the aggrieved party (appellant) has already resorted to an
alternative efficacious remedy under Section 64 of the Act of
1960 before the competent Forum whilst questioning the action
of the Society in cancelling the allotment of the subject plot in
favour of the original allottee and unilateral execution of an
Extinguishment Deed for that purpose?
23.1. (c) Even if the High Court is endowed with a
wide power including to examine the validity of the registered
Extinguishment Deed and the subsequent registered deeds,
should it foreclose the issues which involve disputed questions of
fact and germane for adjudication by the competent Forum
W.P.(MD).Nos.6889,8330,13297 of 2020,11674 of 2015
and W.A(MD)No.800 of 2022
23.4. (d) Whether the Sub-Registrar (Registration) has
authority to cancel the registration of any document including
an Extinguishment Deed after it is registered? Similarly, whether
the Inspector General (Registration) can cancel the registration
of Extinguishment Deed in exercise of powers under Section
23.5. (e) Whether the Sub-Registrar (Registration) had
no authority to register the Extinguishment Deed dated 9th
August 2001, unilaterally presented by the Respondent Society
23.6. (f) Whether the dictum in the case of Thota
Ganga Laxmi (supra) is with reference to the express statutory
Rule framed by the State of Andhra Pradesh or is a general
proposition of law applicable even to the State of Madhya
Pradesh, in absence of an express provision in that regard?”
25.While considering the questions formulated by Hon'ble Supreme
Court, the Hon'ble Supreme Court distinquished the judgment of Hon'ble
Supreme Court in Thota Ganga Laxmi case reported in (2010) 15 SCC 207 on
the ground that the dictum in the said decision is based on Rule 26(k)(i) of Rule
approved by state of Andhrapradesh under Section 69 of the Registration Act,
1908 which mandates the Registration authority to ensure that cancellation
deeds are executed by all the executant and claimant to the previously
registered conveyance and that such cancellation deed is accompanied by a
W.P.(MD).Nos.6889,8330,13297 of 2020,11674 of 2015
and W.A(MD)No.800 of 2022
declaration showing mutual consent or orders of a competent civil or High
Court or State or Central Government annulling the transaction. A reference
was also made to a decision of our High Court in the case of E.R.Kalaivan-vs-
Inspector General of Registration, reported in AIR 2010(Mad.) 18, which was
followed by his Lordship V.Gopala Gowda.J while giving his dissenting view
before reference. The absence of a specific provisions under Registration Act,
or Rules framed by the State of Madhyapradesh requiring signatures of both the
vendor and the purchasers or the presence of both before the Sub-Registrar to
present the deed of extinguishment was the main reason stated by the Hon'ble
Supreme Court to distinguish a few judgments. The following paragraphs in the
said judgment gives the reasonings of Hon'ble Supreme Court for its decision.
“44.In the dissenting opinion, reference has been made
to the decision of the Division Bench of the Madras High Court in
the case of E.R. Kalaivan (supra). It was a case where the
Registering Officer refused to register the deed of cancellation
presented before him on the ground that the cancellation deed was
sought to be registered without there being a consent from the
purchaser. The aggrieved person approached the Inspector
General of Registration who in turn issued a circular dated
5.10.2007 addressed to all the Registering Officers in the State,
that the deed of cancellation should bear the signatures of both
the vendor and the purchaser. The validity of this circular was
challenged by way of Writ Petition before the High Court. In the
W.P.(MD).Nos.6889,8330,13297 of 2020,11674 of 2015
and W.A(MD)No.800 of 2022
present case, our attention has neither been invited to any express
provision in the Act of 1908, Rules framed by the State of Madhya
Pradesh nor any circular issued by the Competent Authority of the
State of Madhya Pradesh to the effect that the Extinguishment
Deed should bear the signatures of both the vendor and the
purchaser and both must be present before the Registering Officer
when the document is presented for registration. Absent such an
express provision, insistence of presence of both parties to the
documents by the Registering Officer, may be a matter of
prudence. It cannot undermine the procedure prescribed for
registration postulated in the Act of 1908.
45. The moot question in this case is : whether the
action of the Society to cancel the allotment of the plot followed by
execution of an Extinguishment Deed was a just action? That will
have to be considered keeping in mind the provisions of the Act of
1960 and the Bye-laws of the Society which are binding on the
members of the Society. The interplay of the provisions of
the Contract Act and the Specific Relief Act and of the Co-
operative Laws and the Bye Laws of the Society permitting
cancellation of allotment of plot or the membership of the
concerned member will have to be considered in appropriate
proceedings. Whether the decision of the Society to cancel the
allotment of plot made in favour of its member is barred by the
law of Limitation Act, is again a matter to be tested in the
proceedings before the Cooperative Forum where a dispute has
been filed by the appellant, if the appellant pursues that
contention.
W.P.(MD).Nos.6889,8330,13297 of 2020,11674 of 2015
and W.A(MD)No.800 of 2022
46. In our considered view, the decision in the case of
Thota Ganga Laxmi (supra) was dealing with an express
provision, as applicable to the State of Andhra Pradesh and in
particular with regard to the registration of an Extinguishment
Deed. In absence of such an express provision, in other State
legislations, the Registering Officer would be governed by the
provisions in the Act of 1908. Going by the said provisions, there
is nothing to indicate that the Registering Officer is required to
undertake a quasi judicial enquiry regarding the veracity of the
factual position stated in the document presented for registration
or its legality, if the tenor of the document suggests that it requires
to be registered. The validity of such registered document can,
indeed, be put in issue before a Court of competent jurisdiction.
47. In the present case, the document in question no
doubt is termed as an Extinguishment Deed. However, in effect, it
is manifestation of the decision of the Society to cancel the
allotment of the subject plot given to its member due to non
fulfillment of the obligation by the member concerned. The subject
document is linked to the decision of the Society to cancel the
membership of the allottee of the plot given to him/her by the
Housing Society. In other words, it is the decision of the Society,
which the Society is entitled to exercise within the frame work of
the governing cooperative laws and the Bye-laws which are
binding on the members of the Society. The case of Thota Ganga
Laxmi (supra), besides the fact that it was dealing with an express
provision contained in the Statutory Rule, namely Rule 26 (k)(i) of
the Andhra Pradesh Registration Rules 1960, was also not a case
W.P.(MD).Nos.6889,8330,13297 of 2020,11674 of 2015
and W.A(MD)No.800 of 2022
of a deed for cancellation of allotment of plot by the Housing
Society. But, of a cancellation of the registered sale deed executed
between private parties, which was sought to be cancelled
unilaterally. Even for the latter reason the exposition in the case of
Thota Ganga Laxmi (supra) will have no application to the fact
situation of the present case.
48. Taking any view of the matter, therefore, we are of
the considered opinion that, the High Court has justly dismissed
the writ petition filed by the appellant with liberty to the appellant
to pursue statutory remedy resorted to by him under the Act of
1960 or by resorting to any other remedy as may be advised and
permissible in law. All questions to be considered in those
proceedings will have to be decided on its own merits.”
26.In the light of the precedents above referred to, this Court is
inclined to refer some of the provisions of the Tamil Nadu Registration Act and
the Rules. We noticed that at the time of hearing the issue by the Full Bench
earlier. In Latif Estate Line India Ltd., case, Section 22(A) of the Tamil Nadu
Registration Act, which was then in the Statute was struck down. However,
Section 22(A) was again introduced by Tamil Nadu Act 28 of 2012 dated
21.06.2012. The amendment came into force with effect from 20.10.2016. After
amendment, Section 22(A) of the Tamil Nadu Registration Act, 1908 reads as
W.P.(MD).Nos.6889,8330,13297 of 2020,11674 of 2015
and W.A(MD)No.800 of 2022
(i)   conveyance   of   properties     belonging       to    the
Government or the local bodies such as the Chennai Metropolitan
Development Authority, or Corporations, or Municipalities, or
Town Panchayats, or Panchayat Unions, or Village Panchayats ;
(ii) conveyance of properties belonging to any religious
institutions including temples, mutts, or specific endowments
managed by the Hereditary Trustees / Non-hereditary Trustees
appointed to any religious institution under a Scheme settled or
deemed to have been settled under the provisions of the Tamil
Nadu Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments Act, 1959
(Tamil Nadu Act 22 of 1959) and mutts and temples including
specific endowments attached to such of those temples managed
(iii) conveyance of properties assigned to, or held by
(a) the Tamil Nadu State Bhoodan Yagna Board
established under section 3 of the Tamil Nadu Bhoodan Yagna
Act, 1958 (Tamil Nadu Act XV of 1958) ; or
(b) the Tamil Nadu Wakf Board, unless a sealed No
Objection Certificate issued by the competent authority as
provided under the relevant Act or the rules framed thereunder for
this purpose and in the absence of any such provision in any
relevant Act or in the rules framed thereunder, authority so
authorised by the Government, to the effect that such registration
is not in contravention of the provisions of the respective Act, is
produced before the registering officer ;
W.P.(MD).Nos.6889,8330,13297 of 2020,11674 of 2015
and W.A(MD)No.800 of 2022
(2) conveyance of lands, converted as house sites
without the approved layouts unless a No Objection Certificate
issued by the authority concerned of such local bodies, namely,
Corporations, or Municipalities, or Town Panchayats, Panchayat
Unions, or Village Panchayats or Chennai Metropolitan
Development Authority is produced before the registering officer ;
(3) cancellation of sale deeds without the express
consent of the parties to the documents.
27.Similarly Section 34-A as introduced by the Registration (Tamil
Nadu Amendment)Act 28 of 2000, which came into effect from 14.04.2001
“34-A. Person claiming under document for sale of
property also to sign document.- Subject to the provisions of this
Act, no document for sale of property shall be registered under this
Act, unless the person claiming under the document has also signed
such document.”
28.After amendment, every deed of sale should be mutual and an
instrument relating to cancellation of sale deeds, without the consent of the
person claiming under the said document, cannot be entertained by the
Registering Officer and there is a statutory prohibition to register the document
of unilateral cancellation. Therefore, by virtue of amendment, there is a
statutory backing to support the view expressed by the earlier Full Bench,
W.P.(MD).Nos.6889,8330,13297 of 2020,11674 of 2015
and W.A(MD)No.800 of 2022
which we have no hesitation to approve. Similarly the judgment of Hon'ble
Supreme Court in Thota Ganga Laxmi-vs- State of Andhrapradesh, reported
in (2010)15 SCC 207 is applicable to the State of Tamil Nadu in view of the
specific bar by virtue of sub-Section 3 of Section 22-A of Registration Act. We
have to examine the position even before the amendment in 2016 introducing
Sub Section 3 of Section 22-A of Registration Act.
29.We find that the scope of enquiry by the Registering Officer is
broad. However, the remedies are also available to the aggrieved by virtue of
specific provisions viz., Sections 71 to 76 of the Registration Act. Sections 34
and 35 are also relevant. It is useful to extract the Sections hereunder:
34.Enquiry before registration by registering officer.—(1)
Subject to the provisions contained in this Part and in sections 41,
43, 45, 69, 75, 77, 88 and 89, no document shall be registered under
this Act, unless the persons executing such document, or their
representatives, assigns or agents authorised as aforesaid, appear
before the registering officer within the time allowed for
presentation under sections 23, 24, 25 and 26: Provided that, if
owing to urgent necessity or unavoidable accident all such persons
do not so appear, the Registrar, in cases where the delay in
appearing does not exceed four months, may direct that on payment
of a fine not exceeding ten times the amount of the proper
registration fee, in addition to the fine, if any, payable under section
25, the document may be registered. (2) Appearances under sub-
W.P.(MD).Nos.6889,8330,13297 of 2020,11674 of 2015
and W.A(MD)No.800 of 2022
section (1) may be simultaneous or at different times. (3) The
registering officer shall thereupon— (a) enquire whether or not
such document was executed by the persons by whom it purports to
have been executed; (b) satisfy himself as to the identity of the
persons appearing before him and alleging that they have executed
the document; and (c) in the case of any person appearing as a
representative, assign or agent, satisfy himself of the right of such
person so to appear. (4) Any application for a direction under the
proviso to sub-section (1) may be lodged with a SubRegistrar, who
shall forthwith forward it to the Registrar to whom he is
subordinate. (5) Nothing in this section applies to copies of decrees
or orders.
Section 35. Procedure on admission and denial of
execution respectively.—(1) (a) If all the persons executing the
document appear personally before the registering officer and are
personally known to him, or if he be otherwise satisfied that they
are the person they represent themselves to be, and if they all admit
the execution of the document, or (b) if in the case of any person
appearing by a representative, assign or agent, such representative,
assign or agent admits the execution, or (c) if the person executing
the document is dead, and his representative or assign appears
before the registering officer and admits the execution, the
registering officer shall register the document as directed in
sections 58 to 61 inclusive. (2) The registering officer may, in order
to satisfy himself that the persons appearing before him are the
persons they represent themselves to be, or for any other purpose
contemplated by this Act, examine any one present in his office. (3)
W.P.(MD).Nos.6889,8330,13297 of 2020,11674 of 2015
and W.A(MD)No.800 of 2022
(a) If any person by whom the document purports to be executed
denies its execution, or (b) if any such person appears to the
registering officer to be a minor, an idiot or a lunatic, or (c) if any
person by whom the document purports to be executed is dead, and
his representative or assign denies its execution, the registering
officer shall refuse to register the document as to the person so
denying, appearing or dead: Provided that, where such officer is a
Registrar, he shall follow the procedure prescribed in Part XII: 1
[Provided further that the 2 [State Government] may, by
notification in the 3 [Official Gazette], declare that any Sub-
Registrar named in the notification shall, in respect of documents
the execution of which is denied, be deemed to be a Registrar for
the purposes of this sub-section and of Part XII.]
30.In this context, it is useful to refer to Rules 55 and 162 of the
Rules, which are approved by the State Government under Section 69 of the
55.It forms no part of a registering officer's duty to
enquire into the validity of a document brought to him for
registration or to attend any written or verbal protest against the
registration of a document based on the ground that the executing
party had no right to execute the document: but he is bound to
consider objections raised on any of the grounds stated below.-
(a)that the parties appearing or about to appear before
him are not the persons they profess to be;
W.P.(MD).Nos.6889,8330,13297 of 2020,11674 of 2015
and W.A(MD)No.800 of 2022
(c) that the person appearing as a representative, assign
or agent, has no right to appear in that capacity;
(d) that the executing party is not really dead, as alleged
by the party applying for registration; or
(e) that the executing party is a minor or an idiot or a
lunatic."
Rule 162 of the Registration Rules reads as follows:
"162. When registration is refused the reasons for
refusal shall be at once recorded in Book 2. They will usually come
under one or more of the heads mentioned below---
I. Section 19.---That the document is written in a
language which the Registering Officer does not understand and
which is not commonly used in the District, and that it is
unaccompanied by a true translation and a true copy.
II. Section      20.---That       it     contains        unattested
interlineations, blanks, erasures or alterations which in the
opinion of the Registering Officer require to be attested.
III. Section 21.---(1) to (3) and Section 22.-- That the
description of the property is insufficient to identify it or does not
contain the information required by Rule 18.
IV. Section 21(4).---That the document is unaccompanied
by a copy or copies of any map or plan which it contains.
W.P.(MD).Nos.6889,8330,13297 of 2020,11674 of 2015
and W.A(MD)No.800 of 2022
V. Rule 32.---That the date of execution is not stated in
the document or that the correct date is not ascertainable.
VI. Sections 23, 24, 25, 26, 72, 75 and 77.---That it is
presented after the prescribed time.
VII. Sections 32, 33, 40 and 43.---That it is presented by
a person who has no right to present it.
VIII. Section 34.---That the executing parties or their
representatives, assigns, or agents have failed to appear within the
prescribed time.
IX. Sections 34 and 43.---That the Registering Officer is
not satisfied as to the identity of a person appearing before him
who alleges that he has executed the document.
X. Sections 34 and 40.---That the Registering Officer is
not satisfied as to the right of a person appearing as a
representative, assign, or agent so to appear.
XI. Section 35.---That execution is denied by any person
purporting to be an executing party or by his agent.
Note:-When a Registering Officer is satisfied that an
executant is purposely keeping out of the day with a view to evade
registration of a document or has gone to a distant place and is
not likely to return to admit execution within the prescribed time,
registration may be refused the non- appearance being treated as
tantamount to denial of execution.
XII. Section 35.---That the person purporting to have
executed the document is a minor, an idiot or a lunatic.
W.P.(MD).Nos.6889,8330,13297 of 2020,11674 of 2015
and W.A(MD)No.800 of 2022
Note:-When the executant of a document who is
examined under a commission under Section 38 of the Act is
reported by the Commissioner to be a minor, an idiot or a lunatic
registration may be refused and it is not necessary that the
Registering Officer should personally examine the executant to
satisfy himself as to the existence of the disqualification.
XIII. Section 35.---That execution is denied by the
representative or assign of a deceased person by whom the
document purports to have been executed.
Note:-When some of the representatives of a deceased
executant admit and others deny execution, the registration of the
document shall be refused in toto, the persons interested being left
to apply to the Registrar for an enquiry into the fact of execution.
XIV. Sections 35 and 41.---That the alleged death of a
person by whom the document purports to have been executed has
not been proved.
XV. Section 41.---That the Registering Officer is not
satisfied as to the fact of execution in the case of a will or of an
authority to adopt presented after the death of the testator or
donor.
XVI. Sections 25, 34 and 80.---That prescribed fee or
fine has not been paid.
XVII. Section 230(A) of the Income Tax Act, 1961 (Act 43
of 1961).--That the prescribed certificates from the Income Tax
Officer has not been produced.
XVIII. Section 10 of the Tamil Nadu Land Reforms
(Fixation of Ceiling of Land) Act, 1961 (Act 58 of 1961).---That
W.P.(MD).Nos.6889,8330,13297 of 2020,11674 of 2015
and W.A(MD)No.800 of 2022
the declaration has not been filed by the transfer. XIX. Section 27
of the Tamil Nadu Urban Land (Ceiling and Regulation) Act, 1978
(Act 24 of 1978).---That the statement has not been filed by the
transferror and transferee.
31.Hence as per Rule 55 of the rules approved by the State, the
Registering Officer is bound to consider any objections as to the identity of
person appearing before him as executant or authority as representing the
executant or the allegation of forgery. When the Registering Authority accept
any document for registration despite objections or refuse to register the
document, the person aggrieved can file an appeal under Section 72 of the
Registration Act. In view of the specific provision under Sections 71 to 77 of
the Registration Act, the aggrieved persons may either file an appeal under
Section 72 or submit an application before the Registrar as the case may be.
When the registrar refused to order the document to be registered under Section
72 or Section 76, it is open to the person aggrieved to institute a civil suit
within the local limits of the whose original jurisdiction, the Registrar Office, in
which, the document is sought to be registered is situate for a decree directing
the document to be registered.
32.The scope of Sections 71 to 76 and the procedure to be followed
W.P.(MD).Nos.6889,8330,13297 of 2020,11674 of 2015
and W.A(MD)No.800 of 2022
were considered by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Veena Singh's case reported
in (2022) 7 SCC 1. On the combined reading of the provisions of the
Registration Act and the Rules approved by the State Government of Tamil
Nadu, and the other Provisions relating to Registration of Power of Attorney
deed as dealt with by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Asset
Reconstruction Company (India) Limited-vs-S.P.Velayutham and others,
reported in 2022 SCC Online 544, the registering authority, whether he is
exercising a quashi-judicial power, or performing an administrative act, the
High Court is empowered to see whether he performed the duties statutorily
ordained upon him in the manner prescribed by law. The Hon'ble Supreme
Court in the case of Suraj Lamp and Industries (P) ltd,-vs-State of Haryana,
reported in (2009) 7 SCC 363, has considered the object of Registration Act,
1908. It is held that registration provides safety and security to transactions
relating to immovable property and it gives publicity and public exposure to
documents thereby prevent forgeries and frauds in regard to execution of
documents. It is further held that Registration gives solemnity of form and
perpetuate documents which are of legal importance or relevance by recording
them, where people may see the record and enquire and ascertain what the
particulars are and as far as land is concerned what obligations exist with
regard to them. Registration ensures that every person dealing with immovable
W.P.(MD).Nos.6889,8330,13297 of 2020,11674 of 2015
and W.A(MD)No.800 of 2022
property can rely with confidence upon the statements contained in the registers
(maintained under Registration Act) as a full and complete account of all
transactions by which title to the property can be ascertained. Any act or
omission of Registrar which may interfere with the transfer or title of anyone
has to be deprecated as one against public policy.
33.The Registering Authority in certain factual situation may accept a
document for registration contrary to the statutory provisions and the person
who is aggrieved by the registration of such document which ought not have
been accepted as in the case of unilateral cancellation of sale deed or settlement
deed, can always approach this Court invoking the extraordinary jurisdiction of
High Court under Article 226 of the Constitution of India. Therefore, the
Hon'ble Supreme Court on several occasion as referred to above has expressed
the view that a writ petition is maintainable questioning the registration of
document of cancellation of conveyance or accept fraudulent transactions
without following the procedure. Even in a case where the power of attorney
deed produced by the agent which does not authorize the power of attorney
agent to sell the property, it is not necessary that the person aggrieved should be
driven to the Civil Court for cancelling the sale under Section 31 of the Specific
W.P.(MD).Nos.6889,8330,13297 of 2020,11674 of 2015
and W.A(MD)No.800 of 2022
Relief Act, if a sale executed by the power of attorney is registered, as held by
Hon'ble Supreme Court in Asset Reconstruction Company (P) Ltd., case.
34.It is useful to extract Section 5 of the Transfer of Property Act,
“Transfer of property” defined.—In the following
sections “transfer of property” means an act by which a living
person conveys property, in present or in future, to one or more
other living persons, or to himself, 1[or to himself] and one or
more other living persons; and “to transfer property” is to
perform such act. 1[In this section “living person” includes a
company or association or body of individuals, whether
incorporated or not, but nothing herein contained shall affect any
law for the time being in force relating to transfer of property to or
by companies, associations or bodies of individuals.]
35.The properties that can be transferred are enumerated under
Section 6 of the Transfer of Property Act. Section 6 of the Transfer of Property
“6.What may be transferred.—Property of any kind may
be transferred, except as otherwise provided by this Act or by any
other law for the time being in force,—
W.P.(MD).Nos.6889,8330,13297 of 2020,11674 of 2015
and W.A(MD)No.800 of 2022
(a) The chance of an heir-apparent succeeding to an estate, the
chance of a relation obtaining a legacy on the death of a kinsman,
or any other mere possibility of a like nature, cannot be
(b) A mere right of re-entry for breach of a condition subsequent
cannot be transferred to any one except the owner of the property
(c) An easement cannot be transferred apart from the dominant
(d) All interest in property restricted in its enjoyment to the owner
personally cannot be transferred by him; 1[(dd) A right to future
maintenance,      in  whatsoever     manner      arising,     secured      or
determined, cannot be transferred;]
(e) A mere right to sue 2[***] cannot be transferred;
(f) A public office cannot be transferred, nor can the salary of a
public officer, whether before or after it has become payable;
(g) Stipends allowed to military 3[naval], 4[air-force] and civil
pensioners of the 5[Government] and political pensions cannot be
(h) No transfer can be made (1) in so far as it is opposed to the
nature of the interest affected thereby, or (2) 6[for an unlawful
object or consideration within the meaning of section 23 of the
Indian Contract Act, 1872 (9 of 1872)], or (3) to a person legally
disqualified to be transferee; 7[(i) Nothing in this section shall be
deemed to authorise a tenant having an untransferable right of
occupancy, the farmer of an estate in respect of which default has
been made in paying revenue, or the lessee of an estate, under the
management of a Court of Wards, to assign his interest as such
tenant, farmer or lessee.]
W.P.(MD).Nos.6889,8330,13297 of 2020,11674 of 2015
and W.A(MD)No.800 of 2022
36.Section 7 of the Transfer of Property Act, is extracted hereunder:
7. Persons competent to transfer.—Every person
competent to contract and entitled to transferable property, or
authorised to dispose of transferable property not his own, is
competent to transfer such property either wholly or in part, and
either absolutely or conditionally, in the circumstances, to the
extent and in the manner, allowed and prescribed by any law for
the time being in force.
37.Section 8 of the Transfer of Property Act deals with the effect of
the transfer by operation. Section 8 of the Transfer of Property reads as follows:
“8. Operation of transfer.—Unless a different intention
is expressed or necessarily implied, a transfer of property
passes forthwith to the transferee all the interest which the
transferor is then capable of passing in the property and in the
legal incidents thereof. Such incidents include, where the
property is land, the easements annexed thereto, the rents and
profits thereof accruing after the transfer, and all things
attached to the earth; and, where the property is machinery
attached to the earth, the moveable parts thereof; and, where the
property is a house, the easements annexed thereto, the rent
thereof accruing after the transfer, and the locks, keys, bars,
doors, windows, and all other things provided for permanent
use therewith; and, where the property is a debt or other
actionable claim, the securities therefor (except where they are
W.P.(MD).Nos.6889,8330,13297 of 2020,11674 of 2015
and W.A(MD)No.800 of 2022
also for other debts or claims not transferred to the transferee),
but not arrears of interest accrued before the transfer; and,
where the property is money or other property yielding income,
the interest or income thereof accruing after the transfer takes
effect.”
38.Section 54 of the Transfer of Property Act, reads as follows:
54. “Sale” defined.—‘‘Sale” is a transfer of
ownership in exchange for a price paid or promised or part-
paid and part-promised. Sale how made.—3Such transfer, in the
case of tangible immovable property of the value of one
hundred rupees and upwards, or in the case of a reversion or
other intangible thing, can be made only by a registered
instrument. In the case of tangible immovable property of a
value less than one hundred rupees, such transfer may be made
either by a registered instrument or by delivery of the property.
Delivery of tangible immovable property takes place when the
seller places the buyer, or such person as he directs, in
possession of the property. Contract for sale.—A contract for
the sale of immovable property is a contract that a sale of such
property shall take place on terms settled between the parties. It
does not, of itself, create any interest in or charge on such
property.
W.P.(MD).Nos.6889,8330,13297 of 2020,11674 of 2015
and W.A(MD)No.800 of 2022
39.No transfer can be made in so far as it is opposed to the nature of
interest affected thereby or for an unlawful object as per Section 6 of Transfer
of Property Act. Only a person competent to contract and has a transferable
right is competent to transfer such property. “Sale” is a transfer of ownership in
exchange for a price paid or promised. In case of immovable property of the
value of one hundred rupees and more, it can be made only by a registered
instrument. Once a transfer is made by a registered instrument all the interest
which the transferor is then capable of passing in the property is passed on
forthwith to the transferee. After a deed of conveyance, the transferor has no
transferable interest. The Transfer of Property Act does not permit the
transferor to recall an instrument so as to divest the transferee's title. The
Registration Act does not deal with unilateral cancellation of a sale deed . The
Registration Act does not confer any power to registrar to cancel a document
which had been registered as per the Act. By registration a legal sanctity is
given to the conveyance. When the object of Registration is to ensure public to
rely with confidence upon the statements contained is the registers maintained
in the Registrar's office as a full and complete account of all transaction
affecting title, permitting registrars to accept unilateral cancellation of sale
deed or any other deed of conveyance (except revocation of gift as may be
permitted in accordance with Section 126 of Transfer of Property Act or a Will)
W.P.(MD).Nos.6889,8330,13297 of 2020,11674 of 2015
and W.A(MD)No.800 of 2022
will be opposed to the object and purpose of Registration Act itself and
contrary to the provision of Transfer of property Act. A person, after conveying
all his right by a deed of conveyance, has no right to deal with the property
again affecting, limiting or extinguishing the right or title of transfer for no
consideration. When such deed of cancellation is presented, the deed of
conveyance which had been registered earlier is referred to. It is not as if the
registrar needs to prove further to find out whether the person executing the
document has title. When a deed of cancellation is presented, the incompetency
to transfer is admitted by the executant. The intention of the person presenting
a document cancelling the registered document is fraudulent and the fraud is
accomplished, when such document is registered. Registering Officer has
power to refuse to register a document. A person may file an appeal before
Registrar against an order refusing to register, except on the ground of denial of
execution. Similarly, if the Sub-Registrar refuses to register on the ground of
denial of execution, a person claiming under the document can apply to the
Registrar to establish his right to have the document registered. After accepting
the document for registration and registering the document, the Registrar has
no power under the Registration Act to cancel the Registration. If a document
cancelling the registered deed is accepted for registration by the registering
authority, he intends to do something which he is not authorised under the Act
W.P.(MD).Nos.6889,8330,13297 of 2020,11674 of 2015
and W.A(MD)No.800 of 2022
and it is beyond his power under the Registration Act.
40.Hence, we have no hesitation to answer the issue by holding that
the Sub-Registrar namely, the Registering Authority has no power to accept the
deed of cancellation to nullify the deed of conveyance made earlier.
41.Regarding gift or settlement: With regard to unilateral
cancellation of gift deed, which is not revokable and does not come under the
purview of Section 126 of the Transfer of Property Act, the Registrar has no
power to accept the deed of cancellation to nullify the registered settlement
deed. Section 126 of the Transfer of Property Act, reads as follows:
“126. When gift may be suspended or revoked.—The
donor and donee may agree that on the happening of any specified
event which does not depend on the will of the donor a gift shall be
suspended or revoked; but a gift which the parties agree shall be
revocable wholly or in part, at the mere will of the donor, is void
wholly or in part, as the case may be. A gift may also be revoked in
any of the cases (save want or failure of consideration) in which, if
it were a contract, it might be rescinded. Save as aforesaid, a gift
cannot be revoked. Nothing contained in this section shall be
deemed to affect the rights of transferees for consideration without
notice.
W.P.(MD).Nos.6889,8330,13297 of 2020,11674 of 2015
and W.A(MD)No.800 of 2022
42.Section 126 of the Transfer of Property Act recognizes the power
of revocation where the donor reserves a right to suspend or revoke the gift on
happening of any specified event. However, the illustrations clarifies that the
revocation should be with the assent of the donee and it shall not be at the will
of donor as a gift revocable at the mere Will of the donor is void. The Sub-
registrar cannot decide whether there was consent for revocation outside the
document. If the donor by himself reserves a right to revoke the gift at his Will
without the assent by donee, the gift itself is void. Since we are dealing with
unilateral cancellation, the power of registration of cancellation or revocation
of gift deed cannot be left to the discretion or wisdom of registering authority
on facts which are not available or descernible from the deed of gift. When the
power of revocation is reserved under the document, it is permissible to the
registering officer to accept the document revoking the gift for registration only
in cases where the following conditions are satisfied;
(a)There must be an agreement between the donor and donee that on
the happening of a specified event which does not depend on the Will of the
donor the gift shall be suspended or revoked by the donor.
(b)Such agreement shall be mutual and expressive and seen from the
document of gift.
(c)Cases which do not fall under Section 126 of Transfer of Property
W.P.(MD).Nos.6889,8330,13297 of 2020,11674 of 2015
and W.A(MD)No.800 of 2022
Act, unless the cancellation of Gift or Settlement is mutual, the registering
authority shall not rely upon the self serving statements or recitals in the
cancellation deed. For example questioning whether the gift deed was accepted
or acted upon cannot be decided by the registering authority for the purpose of
cancelling the registration of gift or settlement deed.
43.The donor must specifically reserves such right to suspend or
revoke the gift deed with the consent of donee to attract Section 126 of the
Transfer of Property Act. Unless the agreement is mutual, expressed in the
recitals, the Registering Authority cannot accept the document for registration.
However, the factual allegations with regard to the acceptance of gift or the
issue where the gift was acted upon or not do not come under the purview of
the Registering Officer. Hence, the Registering Officer is not excepted to accept
the document unilaterally cancelling the gift deed, merely on the basis of the
statement of the donor or the recitals in the document for cancellation.
44.From the discussions and conclusions we have reached above with
reference to various provisions of Statutes and precedents, we reiterate the
dictum of Hon'ble Supreme Court in Thota Ganga Laxmi and Ors.-vs-
Government of Andhra Pradesh & Ors., reported in (2010) 15 SCC 207 and
W.P.(MD).Nos.6889,8330,13297 of 2020,11674 of 2015
and W.A(MD)No.800 of 2022
the Full Bench of this Court in Latif Estate Line India Ltd., case, reported in
AIR 2011(Mad) 66 and inclined to follow the judgment of three member Bench
of Hon'ble Supreme Court in Veena Singh's case reported in (2022) 7 SCC 1
and the judgment of two member Bench of Hon'ble Supreme Court in Asset
Reconstruction Company (India) Ltd., case, reported in 2022 SCC On-line SC
544 for the following propositions:
(a)A sale deed or a deed of conveyance other than testamentary
dispositions which is executed and registered cannot be unilaterally cancelled.
(b)Such unilateral cancellation of sale deed or a deed of conveyance
is wholly void and non est and does not operate to execute, assign, limit or
extinguish any right, title or interest in the property.
(c)Such unilateral cancellation of sale deed or deed of conveyance
cannot be accepted for registration.
(d)The transferee or any one claiming under him or her need not
approach the civil Court and a Writ Petition is maintainable to challenge or
nullify the registration.
(e)However, an absolute deed of sale or deed of conveyance which is
duly executed by the transferor may be cancelled by the Civil Court at the
instance of transferor as contemplated under Section 31 of Specific Relief Act.
(f)As regards gift or settlement deed, a deed of revocation or
W.P.(MD).Nos.6889,8330,13297 of 2020,11674 of 2015
and W.A(MD)No.800 of 2022
cancellation is permissible only in a case which fall under Section 126 of
Transfer of Property Act, and the Registering Authority can accept the deed of
cancellation of gift for registration subject to the conditions specified in para 42
of this judgment.
(g)The legal principles above stated by us cannot be applied to
cancellation of Wills or power of Attorney deed which are revocable and not
coupled with interest.
45.As a result of our forgoing conclusions, we answer the reference
by holding that the Registrar has no power to accept the deed of cancellation to
nullify the deed of conveyance made earlier, when the deed of conveyance has
already been acted upon by the transferee. Since anyone may try to mislead or
misinterpret our judgment by referring to the question of reference we insist
that our answer to the reference should be understood in the light of our
conclusions summarised in the previous paragraph.
The decision on individual cases:
46.The writ petition in W.P(MD)No.6889 of 2020 is filed by the
daughter of the second respondent to quash the order passed by the first
respondent under Section 23 of the Maintenance and Welfare of Parents and
W.P.(MD).Nos.6889,8330,13297 of 2020,11674 of 2015
and W.A(MD)No.800 of 2022
Senior Citizens Act 2007. The gift deed executed by the second respondent in
favour of the writ petitioner was unilaterally cancelled by the second
respondent father. The settlement deed stated to have been executed by the
second respondent, dated 06.03.2015 is irrevocable and it is a deed of
settlement out of love and affection. The second respondent has specifically
stated that he has no right to revoke the settlement deed. From the recitals, the
settlement does not attract Section 126 of Tamil Nadu Property Act. It is seen
that the settlor viz., the second respondent, has not put any condition. In other
words, the gift deed is not subject to any condition or terms that the transferor
shall provide the basic amenities and basic physical needs to the second
respondent. In such circumstances, this Court is of the view that there is no
scope for invoking the power provided to the second respondent under Section
23 of the Tamil Nadu Maintenance and Welfare of Parents and Senior Citizens
Act, 2007. Therefore, the order impugned is liable to be quashed. Even though
we agree that the writ petition can be allowed, this Court is unable to decide the
writ petition in this batch where question referred to us is different. Hence, the
writ petition in W.P(MD)No.6889 of 2020 is de-linked and the Registry is
directed to list the matter before the appropriate Bench.
W.P.(MD).Nos.6889,8330,13297 of 2020,11674 of 2015
and W.A(MD)No.800 of 2022
47.In view of our conclusions and answer to the reference, the writ
petition in W.P(MD)Nos.11674 of 2015 and 8330 of 2020 are allowed. The writ
petition in W.P(MD)No.13297 of 2020 is dismissed. Similarly, the writ appeal
in W.A(MD)No.800 of 2022 is dismissed. In all cases, it is open to the
aggrieved person to file a civil suit challenging the gift or settlement deed as
may be permissible under Section 31 of the Specific Relief Act. No costs.
Consequently, connected miscellaneous petition is closed.
