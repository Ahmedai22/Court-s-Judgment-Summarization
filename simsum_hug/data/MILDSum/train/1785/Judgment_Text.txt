2. Sri.S.Kannan – learned Senior Government Pleader, has
placed on record the reports of the two police officers, with respect
to the incidents mentioned therein.
3. We do not propose to say in detail today; but, suffice it to
record that we cannot approve of the attacks on doctors and
medical personnel, whatever be the reason. We are indicating this
because, we get the feeling that there is an attempt – perhaps
unintended – to justify the attacks in one form or the other.
4. We make it clear that, whatever be the provocation or
reason that anyone may impel or project, an attack on a medical
personnel is unacceptable and that this is non-negotiable.
5. The Government, therefore, has to now tell us the modus to
ensure such attacks never take place, because what we are
concerned about is not the action after such an attack, but the
prevention itself.
6. Sri.S.Kannan – learned Senior Government Pleader sought a
R.P.No.379 of 2021 in W.P.(C)No.10659 of 2021 & W.P.(C)No.11820 of 2021
few days time for this, but taking note of the fact that two or three
other incidents are also stated to have happened during the period
when we are in seizen of this issue, we deem it appropriate to list it
on 30.03.2023 itself, because we do not think that any time can be
We close for now, recording that it is our firm belief that
unless the Civil society is properly sensitized, as also the doctors,
the unfortunate strife at least in a very few cases, will continue.
Our endeavor is to end this and we, therefore, call upon the
Government            to    come       out     with     firm      suggestions including,
legislative, if they have any in mind.
List on 30.03.2023.
