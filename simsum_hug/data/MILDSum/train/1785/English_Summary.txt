The Kerala High Court recently asked the government to come out with suggestions, including on legislative intervention, to curtail the attacks on medical personnel. 
The Division Bench of Justice Devan Ramachandran and Justice Kauser Edappagath said whatever be the provocation or reason that anyone may impel or project, an attack on a medical personnel is unacceptable and non-negotiable.

"The Government, therefore, has to now tell us the modus to ensure such attacks never take place, because what we are concerned about is not the action after such an attack, but the prevention itself," the court said.
The court said it cannot approve of the attacks on doctors and medical personnel, whatever be the reason. 
"We are indicating this because, we get the feeling that there is an attempt – perhaps unintended – to justify the attacks in one form or the other," it observed. 

The court further said that the civil society would also have to be sensitized to counter such attacks. 
"...it is our firm belief that unless the Civil society is properly sensitized, as also the doctors, the unfortunate strife at least in a very few cases, will continue. Our endeavor is to end this and we, therefore, call upon the Government to come out with firm suggestions including, legislative, if they have any in mind," said the court

As time was sought by the Government Pleader S. Kannan to respond to court's suggestions, and also taking note that two or three attacks had already occurred while the court was seized of the issue, the bench posted the case for further consideration on March 30.
