"Every lawyer, who appears for his client, has a right of fair hearing, irrespective of who the complainant is," the Delhi High Court has recently observed recently.
Justice Talwant Singh was dealing with a plea filed by seven accused persons seeking anticipatory bail directly in the High Court after claiming that since the complainant was an advocate, a fair hearing before the District Court was not possible because their counsels may be heckled during arguments. 
However, the complainant, who was present in the court, assured the Bench that no such thing would happen.
Thus, the Court was of the view:
"In any case, learned Principal District & Sessions Judge, New Delhi District, Patiala House Courts, New Delhi is requested to ensure that no such incident happen as and when the applicants approach the District Court for anticipatory bail."
"Every lawyer, who appears for his client, has a right of fair hearing, irrespective of who the complainant is."
The Court directed that a copy of the order be sent to Principal District and Sessions Judge of the Patiala House Courts.
"At the request of the learned counsel for the applicants, let they be allowed to withdraw the bail applications with liberty to approach the district court for filing fresh applications for anticipatory bail," the Court said.
