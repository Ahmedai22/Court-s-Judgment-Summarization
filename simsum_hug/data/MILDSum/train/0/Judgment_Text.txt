1. Heard Sri Gopal Chaturvedi, learned Senior Advocate, assisted by Sri Ajay
Srivastava, learned counsel for the petitioner and Sri Gambhir Singh, learned
A.G.A. for the State-respondents.
2. This writ petition has been filed praying for the following reliefs:
“(i) Issue a writ or direction in the nature of certiorari quash the first information
report dated 19.03.2021 lodged by Respondent no.2 as case crime no.55/2021
Under section 3(1) Gangster & Anti Social Activities Act 1986 Police Station
Dakshintola District Mau (Annexure No.1 to the writ petition).
(ii) Issue a writ or direction in the nature of mandamus directing the respondent
not to arrest the petitioner in as case crime no.55/2021 Under section 3(1)
3. In paragraph-11 of the writ petition, the petitioner has admitted that four
criminal cases, namely, Case Crime No.724 of 2019 under Sections 379, 447,
I.P.C. in P.S. Kotwali, District Ghazipur, Case Crime No.725 of 2019 under
Sections 379, 447, I.P.C. in P.S. Kotwali, District Ghazipur, Case Crime No.594
of 2019 under Sections 181, 420, I.P.C. in P.S. Kotwali, District Ghazipur and
Case Crime No.667 of 2020 under Section 3(1)(2) of U.P. Gangsters Act, P.S.
Kotwali, District Ghazipur, are registered against him. As per impugned First
Information Report, a Case Crime No.04 of 2020 under Sections 419, 420, 467,
468, 471, 120-B I.P.C. and Section 30 Arms Act is also registered in P.S.
Daskshin Tola, District Mau. In paragraph-5 of the writ petition, the petitioner has
stated that he is innocent and has been falsely implicated because he is real
brother-in-law of Mukhtar Ansari and the present government has started a policy
to harass the political opponent who had fought and won MLA/ parliamentary
election against the ruling party candidate. In paragraph-12 of the writ
petition, the petitioner has stated that the provisions of the Gangsters Act have
not been complied as there is nothing on record to show that the petitioner is
gaining or has accumulated wealth because of the present cases and Section 17
of the Gangsters Act is also not applicable.
4. The contents of the impugned First Information Report No.0055 of
2021, P.S. Dakshin Tola, District Mau under Section 3(1) of the U.P.
Gangsters and Anti Social Activities (Prevention) Act, 1986, are reproduced
5. Sri G.S. Chaturvedi, learned Senior Advocate has submitted as under:-
(i) On the basis of available material of First Information Report
No.0667 of 2020, under Section 2/3 (1) of the U.P. Gangster and
District- Ghazipur was registered against the petitioner, against
which he filed Criminal Misc. Writ Petition No.11479 of 2020
(Anwar Shahjad and another Vs. State of U.P. and 2 others),
which was disposed of observing as under:-
"Be that as it may, as the allegations are in respect of constituting a
gang for grabbing land and acquiring movable and immovable
property through benami transactions, the matter would require
investigation and therefore the prayer of the petitioners to quash the
first information report cannot be accepted.
However, considering the fact that in the two cases cited against the
petitioners, the petitioners were not named in the first information
report and their name has been added through supplementary charge-
sheet and the person who was charge sheeted earlier is not stated to
be gang member in the impugned first information report and that
the petitioners have been granted bail in those cases, we deem it
appropriate to dispose off the petition by providing that the
investigation of the above case shall continue and brought to its
logical conclusion but the petitioners shall not be arrested till
submission of police report under Section 173 (2) CrPC, provided
they co-operate in the investigation."
(ii) The fact of registration of First Information Report No.004 of
2020 dated 05.01.2020, under Section 419, 420, 467, 468, 471,
120-B I.P.C. and Section 30 of Arms Act 1971, P.S.-Dakshintola,
District-Mau was well available at the time of registration of the
aforesaid Case Crime No.0667 of 2020, under Section 2/3 (1) of
the U.P. Gangster and Anti Social Activities (Prevention) Act,
1986 and yet the impugned First Information Report No.0055 of
2021 dated 19.03.2021 under Section 3(1) of the Act, 1986, P.S.-
Dakshintola, District-Mau has been registered against the
petitioner which is nothing but abuse of process of law.
(iii) There is nothing in the impugned First Information Report
No.0055 of 2021 which may show that the petitioner has
committed any offence or was involved in any offence after
registration of the earlier First Information Report No.0667 of
2020 under Section 2/3 (1) of the Act, 1986, P.S. Kotwali,
District-Ghazipur dated 11.09.2020. Thus, the allegation made in
the impugned First Information Report so as to bring the
petitioner within the meaning of gang or gangster as defined
under the Act, 1986 for the purposes of registration of the
impugned First Information Report, is wholly arbitrary and
(iv) The order passed by the District Magistrate, Mau under
Section 14(1) of Act 1986 with respect to one Mukhtar Ansari
dated 07.06.2021, has nothing to do with the case of the
petitioner or the FIR lodged against the petitioner under Section
3(1) of the Act, 1986 being FIR No. 0055 of 2021 dated
(v) The impugned FIR registered against the petitioner on the
basis of Criminal Case No. 004 of 2020, under Sections 419, 420,
467, 468, 471, 120-B I.P.C. and Section 30 of the Arms Act,
Police Station Dakshintola, District Mau, being single case as
shown in the gang chart, cannot be made basis for registering the
impugned FIR under Section 3(1) of the Act, particularly when
the FIR No. 04 of 2020 was registered on the basis of an alleged
incidence of the year 2001.
6. Sri Gambhir Singh, learned A.G.A. has submitted as under:-
(i) The charge-sheet in case crime no.0004 of 2020 has already
been submitted. The petitioner has not challenged the cahrge-
sheet, the basis of registration of impugned First Information
Report No.0055 of 2021 is that the petitioner is the member of
the gang, habitual of committing crimes as provided under
Section 2(b) of the Act, 1986. Therefore, the registration of the
impugned First Information Report on the basis of materials
available with the police satisfies the ingredients of gangsters and
the penal clause i.e. Section 3 (1) of the Act, 1986 and thus, fully
justifies registration of the impugned First Information Report.
(ii) As per gang chart filed as Annexure-2 to the writ petition,
there are four members including the petitioner in the gang which
is led by one Mukhtar Ansari and the members are Israel Ansari,
Salim Ansari and the petitioner i.e. Anwar Sahjad. The impugned
First Information Report and the F.I.R. No.0667 of 2020 under
the Gangster Act were registered in different police stations in
different districts and the gangs were also different. Therefore,
there being different composition of gangs, the impugned First
Information Report cannot be challenged on the basis of another
First Information Report No.0667 of 2020.
(iii) The F.I.R. under Section 3(1) of the Act, 1986 can be
registered even on the basis of the single case. Reliance has been
placed upon a Division Bench judgment in the case of Rinku
Alias Hukku Versus State of U.P. and another, 2002 (2) AWC
1446, 2000 CriLJ2834, (paras 7 & 8) and Udham Singh Versus
State of U.P. and others 2008 (61) ACC 642, (paras 8 & 9),
decided on 26.03.2008 in Criminal Writ Petition No.4555 of
7. We have carefully considered the submissions of the learned counsels
for the parties and perused the record of the writ petition.
8. Perusal of the impugned first information report as afore-quoted prima
facie discloses commission of cognizable offence. The question as to whether
a first information report under the Act, 1986 can be lodged on the basis of
involvement of an accused in single previous case, is no more res integra. In a
recent judgment dated 05.08.2021 in Criminal Misc. Writ Petition No.3938 of
2021 (Ritesh Kumar Alias Rikki vs. State of U.P. and another), a coordinate
bench of this Court has considered the following question:
"Whether a first information report under the provisions of the Uttar Pradesh
Gangsters and Anti-Social Activities (Prevention) Act, 1986 [hereinafter
referred to as the ''Gangsters Act'] can be lodged and is maintainable on the
basis of involvement of the petitioner(s) / accused in a single previous case".
9. The Division Bench answered the afore-quoted question in the aforesaid
case of Ritesh Kumar Alias Rikki (supra), as under:
“As per the settled principles of law, the lodging of a first information report
on the basis of a single case, is valid and permissible.”
10. In the aforesaid case of Ritesh Kumar Alias Rikki (supra), the Division
Bench after referring to the judgments of Hon’ble Supreme Court in the case
of State of Telangana v. Habib Abdullah Jellani, (2017) 2 SCC 779 and M/s
Neeharika Infrastructure Pvt. Ltd. Vs. State of Maharashtra and others
(Criminal Appeal No. 330 of 2021 in its judgment dated 13.04.2021) has
observed that in a petition under Article 226 of the Constitution of India, the
High Court cannot adjudicate the correctness of the allegations in the
impugned first information report or the cases on the basis of which the
impugned first information report has been lodged.
11. In the case of M/s Neeharika Infrastructure Pvt. Ltd. (supra), Hon’ble
Supreme Court held that the Courts should not thwart any investigation into
the cognizable offences. It is only in cases where no cognizable offence or
offence of any kind is disclosed in the First Information Report that the Court
will not permit an investigation to go on. The power of quashing should be
exercised sparingly with circumspection, in the rarest of rare cases. While
examining an FIR/complaint, quashing of which is sought, the Court cannot
embark upon an enquiry as to the reliability or genuineness or otherwise of the
allegations made in the FIR/complaint. Criminal proceedings ought not to be
scuttled at the initial stage. Quashing of complaint/FIR should be an exception
rather than an ordinary rule. Ordinarily, the Courts are barred from usurping
the jurisdiction of the police, since the two organs of the State operate in two
specific spheres of activities and one ought not to tread over the other sphere.
The First Information Report is not an encyclopaedia which must disclose all
facts and details regarding the offence reported. Therefore, when the
investigation by the police is in progress, the Court should not go into merits
of the allegations made in the FIR. Police must be permitted to complete the
12. In view of the law settled by Hon’ble Supreme Court in the case of M/s
Neeharika Infrastructure Pvt. Ltd. (supra) and also in view of the law settled
by coordinate bench of this court in the case of Ritesh Kumar @ Rikki (supra),
we do not find any good reason to interfere with the impugned first
information report which prima facie discloses commission of a cognizable
offence.
13. For all the reasons afore-stated, we do not find any merit in this writ
petition. Consequently, the writ petition is dismissed.
