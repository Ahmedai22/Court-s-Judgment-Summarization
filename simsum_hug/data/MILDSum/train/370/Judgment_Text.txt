Counsel for Applicant :- Ishan Baghel,Mohd. Khalid
Counsel for Opposite Party :- G.A.
1. Heard Sri I.B.Singh, learned Senior Advocate assisted
by Sri Ishan Baghel, learned counsel for the applicant, Sri
Anirudh Kumar Singh, learned A.G.A.-I for the State.
2. Instant application under section 482Cr.P.C. has been
filed with a prayer to quash the order dated 19-12-2022
passed by the learned Special Judge, NIA/ATS/Additional
District & Sessions Judge-5, Lucknow in Sessions Case
No. 2219 of 2021, arising out of FIR No. 199 of 2020,
Police Station-Mant, District-Mathura, under sections 153-
A,295A,120-B I.P.C. and sections 17,18, of U.P.P.A. Act,
1967 & sections 65 & 72 of the I.T. Act, 2008. It has
further been prayed to direct the learned Special Judge,
to decide the Discharge Application dated 19-12-2022 of
the applicant on merit, after affording opportunity of
3. The factual matrix of the case in brief is that the
applicant is a Journalist and was working for
AZHIMUKHAM. COM. and when he was travelling to
Hathras to cover the incident of “Hathras Gangrape” for
reporting, he was arrested and detained under sections
107,116 and 151 of Cr.P.C. on 05-10-2020 and was
produced before the SDM Court at Mathura on 06-10-
2020 and thereafter, he was sent to judicial remand
under section 167 Cr.P.C. However, on 06-10-2022, a
false narrative was made in the media that four PFI
members have been arrested by the police and
thereafter, F.I.R. No. 199 of 2020 dated 07-10-2022 was
registered under sections 153-A,295 A and 124 I.P.C;
section 17 & 18 of UAPA Act and 65, 72 & 76 of the IT Act
and thereafter, the chargesheet was filed on 02-04-2021
and the matter proceeded.
4. Learned Senior Advocate appearing for the applicant
submits that several applications were moved for
compliance of Section 207 of Cr.P.C. and ultimately on 07-
01-2022, only 106 pages were provided to the applicant
and most of the copies are illegible. Thereafter, the
applicant moved applications on 21-04-2022 and on 23-
09-2022 before the trial court for ensuring compliance of
Section 207 of Cr.P.C. He next added that co-accused,
Firoz has been provided as many as 4872 pages whereas,
the applicant has been deprieved of and only 106 pages
have been provided to him.
5. He next submits that the trial court without providing
the prosecution papers in compliance of section 207 of
Cr.P.C., proceeded in the matter and fixed the date i.e.
16-12-2022 for framing of charges. He submits that the
accused personns were not present or summoned from
jail on that date and therefore, the matter has again been
posted for 19-12-2022 for framing of charges.
6. He further contended that on 19-12-2022, the
applicant moved a discharge application through his
counsel before the trial court and thereafter, the trial
court without considering the application of the discharge
which was filed by the applicant under section 227 of
Cr.P.C., proceeded to frame charges and thereafter, the
charges have been framed on 19-12-2022 itself. He next
added that though the counsel for the applicant was
sitting inside of the court room, but, the court while
sitting in his chamber, has passed the order and counsel
for the applicant was not heard. In support of his
contentions, he has drawn attention towards page no. 21
of the application wherein objection has been recorded by
the counsel for the applicant on the same day.
7. He has further drawn attention of this court towards
page 21 of the application itself i.e. an order passed by
the trial court that "Sri Rama Shanker Dwivedi Ko
Nyayamitra Niyukt Kiya Jata Hai." and submitted that
neither there was any application moved on behalf of the
accused nor the applicant was represented through his
counsel for making any prayer for appointment of amicus
curiae as is evident from the order itself. Thus, the order
appointing an Amicus Curiae is also against the provisions
of section 304 of Cr.P.C. Section 304 of Cr.P.C. is
extracted hereinunder:-
"304. Where, in a trial before the Court of Session, the accused is
not represented by a pleader, and where it appears to the Court
that the accused has not sufficient means to engage a pleader, the
Court shall assign a pleader for his defence at the expenses of the
The High Court may, with the previous approval of the State
Government make rule providing for;
the mode of selecting pleaders for defence under Sub-Section(1);
the facilities to be allowed to such pleaders by the Courts;
the fee payable to such pleaders by the Government, and
generally, for carrying out the purposes of Sub-Section (1).
The State Government may, by notification, direct that, as from
such date as may be specified in the notificaion, the provisions of
Sub-Sections(1) and (2) shall apply in relation to any class of trials
before other Courts in the State as they apply in relation to trials
before the Courts of Session."
8. Referring the aforesaid, he submits that there is a
specific provision under section 304 Cr.P.C. that an
Amicus Curiae can be appointed if the accused is not
represented by a pleader or the accused has not sufficient
means to engage a pleader. He added that both the
conditions were not prevelant and thus, the appointing an
Amicus Curiae is uncalled for and is against the intent of
the provisions of section 304 of Cr.P.C.
9. Adding his arguments, he submits that so far as
provision of Section 227 of Cr.P.C. is concerned, if an
application is filed, the same is to be considered and
decided. He submits that an application under section 227
of Cr.P.C. was filed by the present applicant, which was
pending consideration and the court without considering
the same, has proceeded for framing of charges. He
submits that it is wrong to say that no one was present
for pressing the application for discharge filed by the
counsel for the applicant. The discharge application is still
pending. Adding his arguments, he submits that even the
application for discharge is not required to be filed by the
accused and it is incumbent upon the court itself that if
the court considers that there is not sufficient ground for
proceeding against the accused, he shall discharge the
accused. He submits that there is not a single whisper
with regard to the application of mind in the order dated
19-12-2022 with respect to the fact that the court below
has ever applied its mind as to whether there is sufficient
ground for proceeding in the matter.
10. He next added and has drawn attention of this court
towards the Judgment and order dated 12-12-2022
passed by the Apex Court in the case of Chandi Puliya
Versus The State of West Bengal (Criminal Appeal No. of
2022(Arising from SLP(Criminal)No. 9897 of 2022) and
has referred to paragarph nos. 3.2, 4, 4.1. and 7 of the
aforesaid Judgment and the aforesaid paras are extracted
3.2 Accordingly, a discharge application under Section 227 r/w
Section 300(1) Cr.P.C. was filed by the appellant before the
learned trial Court. The learned trial Court dismissed the said
application by observing that such an objection can be raised at
the stage of framing of charge and not discharge. The order passed
by the learned trial Court has been confirmed by the High Court,
by the impugned judgment and order. Hence, the present appeal.
4. It is submitted that the stage of discharge under Section 227
Cr.P.C. is a stage prior to charge and it is at this stage alone that
the court can consider an application under Section 300 Cr.P.C. It
is submitted that once the court rejects the discharge application,
it would proceed to framing of charge under Section 228 Cr.P.C.
and the only question before it would be as to the nature of the
offence, and not that the appellant has not committed an offence,
or that he cannot be tried on account of the bar under section 300
4.1 It is further submitted that the courts below have failed to
appreciate that the present proceedings arise from the discharge
proceedings and that the stage of discharge under Section 227
Cr.P.C. precedes the stage of framing of charge under Section 228
Cr.P.C. It is submitted that as observed and held by this Court in
the case of Ratilal Bhanji Mithani v. State of Maharashtra, (1979) 2
SCC 179, once the charges are framed, the accused is disentitled
from praying for discharge.
7. On a fair reading of Section 227 Cr.P.C, if, upon consideration of
the record of the case and the documents submitted therewith, and
after hearing the submissions of the accused and the prosecution
in this behalf, the Judge considers that there is not sufficient
ground for proceeding against the accused, he shall discharge the
accused and record his reasons for doing so. As per Section 228
Cr.P.C. only thereafter and if, after such consideration and hearing
as aforesaid, the Judge is of the opinion that there is ground for
presuming that the accused has committed an offence, the trial
Court shall frame the charge. Therefore, as rightly submitted by
Shri Siddhartha Dave, learned senior counsel appearing on behalf
of the appellant-accused that the stage of discharge under Section
227 Cr.P.C. is a stage prior to framing of the charge (under Section
228 Cr.P.C.) and it is at that stage alone that the court can
consider the application under Section 300 Cr.P.C."
11. Referring the aforesaid paragraphs, he submits that
the settled proposition of law in the aforesaid Judgment
has been violated by the trial court and thus he submits
that the whole proceedings of the trial court so far as
order dated 19-12-2022 for framing of charges is
concerned, vitiates in the eyes of law and thus, the order
dated 19-12-2022 as well as other consequential action is
liable to be set aside.
12. On the other hand, learned A.G.A. appearing for the
State has vehemently opposed the contentions aforesaid
and submits that in case of non appearance of counsel for
the applicant, the court has passed the order on 19-12-
2022. He added that it seems that the counsel for the
applicant came later on and the order impugned was
passed during the court hours. He submits that none
appeared to press the application for discharge and thus,
the trial court had no option, but to pass the order dated
19-12-2022 and to proceed under section 228 of Cr.P.C.
He further submits that after thorough investigation,
sufficient material was found against the applicant and
therefore there is no illegality or infirmity in the order
dated 19-12-2022 passed by the trial court.
13. Considering the submissions of learned counsel for
the parties and after perusal of the material placed on
record, it is evident that an application for discharge was
moved by the present applicant on 19-12-2022 and from
perusal of the order dated 19-12-2022, by virtue of which
charges were framed, it reveals that the discharge
application dated 19-12-2022 was neither accepted nor
rejected by the court. Further, the noting on the
ordersheet discloses that the counsel for the applicant
was present in the court, but, it prima facie seems that
he was not heard. This court has also noticed the fact
that one Rama Shanker Dwivedi, Advocate, was also
appointed as Amicus Curiae on 19-12-2022 itself though
there was no occasion for such appointment.
14. Since, the provision of Section 227 of Cr.P.C. itself
mandates that the trial court shall consider that whether
there is sufficient ground for proceeding against the
accused or not and if trial court reaches to the conclusion
that there is no sufficient ground, the accused shall be
discharged. Section 227 of Cr.P.C. is extracted
“227.If, upon consideration of the record of the case and the
documents submitted therewith, and after hearing submissions of
the accused and the prosecution in this behalf, the Judge considers
that there is not sufficient ground for proceeding against the
accused, he shall discharge the accused and record his reasons for
so doing.”
15. Having at a glace of the aforesaid provisions, it is
crystal clear that while passing an order in abovesaid
provisions, the trial court shall consider ;-
First, the record of the case and documents submitted
Secondly submissions of the accused;
and thirdly the submisisons of the prosecution.
16. It is settled law that even after such considerations,
two view are possible and if one of them gives rise to the
suspicion, which is distinguished from grave suspicion,
the trial Judge is empowered to discharge the accused
without going into the question as to whether a case for
trial has been made out by the prosecution or not.
17. This court is of considered opinion that after the
application of judicial mind on discharge, the trial Judge
shall enter into the next proceeding i.e. framing of the
Charge. It is prima-facie overt from the wordings of
Section 228 of Cr.P.C. i.e. “Framing of Charge” and “if,
after such consideration and hearing, as aforesaid”, the
procedure of Section 227 of Cr.P.C. is of much importance
and that cannot be skipped by the trial court. The intent
of the legislature is very clear that the procedure
prescribed in Section 227 of Cr.P.C. for discharge of the
accused is in fact safeguard and rider so that a person
who has been alleged to commit an offence, may not be
harassed for facing trial proceedings. Therefore, the
application of mind as well as assinging reasons for
passing the order under section 227 of Cr.P.C. is of much
importance, which has to care of by the trial court.
18. Further it is also not incumbent upon the accused that
he must have moved an application for discharge. Even in
a situation that there was no application for discharge
moved, then it is incumbent upon the trial court to
decide it that whether there is sufficient material available
against the accused so as to frame charges,but
opportunity of hearing to the accused at this stage is an
esssential condition.
19. From perusal of the order dated 19-12-2022, it
reveals that it has been recorded by the trial court that
no one is present to press the application filed under
section 227 of Cr.P.C. but, it is noted by the counsel for
the applicant that he was present in the court and he was
not heard.
20. Further so far as issue of the appointment of an
Amicus Curiae is concerned, as per provisions of section
304 of Cr.P.C., there are two conditions, wherein an
Amicus Curiae can be appointed and so far as the present
case is concerned, prima-facie, there seems to be no
such conditions prevalent. From perusal of the order
dated 19-12-2022, it reveals that while appointing the
amicus-curiae, the      trial court did not mention        the
exigency as is envisaged in Section 304 of Cr.P.C. and no
judicial mind has been applied while appointing the
21. It is noteworthy that time and again, the Hon’ble
Apex Court has held that if statute provides for anything
to be done in a particular manner, then it must be done in
that manner alone and not otherwise and thus the
impugned order dated 19-12-2022 is against the law
propounded by the Hon’ble Apex Court.
22. Now, it is settled proposition of law that the trial court
has to make every endeavour to keep the trial fair but in
the order of framing of charges, certain illegalities and
ambiguities are apparent and therefore, the order dated
19-12-2022 prima-facie, seems to unsustainable and thus
the order dated 19-12-2022 is hereby set aside.
23. Resultantly, the matter is remitted back to the trial
court for deciding the discharge application of the
applicant dated 19-12-2022 afresh. For the purpose of
hearing on the application for discharge dated 19-12-
2022,the concerned parties are directed to appear before
the trial court on 27-12-2022. Counsel for the applicant
shall also remain present before the trial court on the said
date and after hearing the parties, the trial court shall
proceed in the matter. The parties or their counsels shall
not seek any adjournment on the said date.
24. With the aforesaid observations,            the    instant
application is hereby allowed.
25. It is made clear that observations made herein above,
will have no bearing on the merits of the case pending
consideration before the trial court.
