1.      The above-captioned two petitions have been filed by the
petitioners seeking a direction to the respondents for relaxation of the
upper age limit for appearing in examination for recruitment to the post of
Head Constable (Ministerial) in CRPF-2022 vide advertisement issued on
2.      Since the subject-matter of both the captioned petitions is similar,
therefore, with the consent of learned counsel for parties, these petitions
were heard together and are being disposed of by this common judgment.
3.      The facts giving rise to the present petitions are that an
advertisement for recruitment to the post of ASI (Steno) Head Constable
(Ministerial) in CRPF-2022 was uploaded on the website on 27.12.2022
inviting the interested applicants. The last date for applying to the said
post is 25.01.2023. The scheme of the examination comprises of
Medical Test (RME). The age limit of candidates prescribed therein is
from 18 to 25 years as on the closing date of receipt of application i.e.
25.01.2023, meaning thereby, a candidate should not born before
26.01.1998 or after 25.01.2005.
4.      The grievance raised by the petitioners in these petitions is that
respondent No.1 had issued a detailed advertisement in 2016 for filling-up
686 vacancies for direct recruitment to the post of Head Constable
(Ministerial) but the petitioners herein could not be selected. Thereafter,
only on 27.12.2022, i.e. after a period of six years, an advertisement for
filling-up vacancies to the said post has been issued. The petitioners are
W.P.(C) 90/2023 & W.P.(C) 301/2023                                Page 2 of 14
aggrieved that the age limit of the candidates prescribed for the said posts
is from 18 to 25 years but since no recruitment was conducted arbitrarily
for last 5-6 years, the petitioners have become over-aged and have crossed
the maximum prescribed age limit, i.e. 25 years and thereby, unable to
apply for the said examination.
5.      During the course of hearing, learned counsel for petitioners
submitted that Department of Personnel and Training (DoPT) vide its
numerous        Office     Memorandums             dated    13.06.2016, 23.06.2016,
02.11.2016 and 23.12.2016 has mandated that all Government
Departments/Organisations shall post all the vacancies on the National
Career Services (NCS) Portal in a timely manner. However, since the
respondent No.1 has not been posting the vacancies for the post of Head
Constable (Ministerial) for the last 5-6 years, therefore, some of the
petitioners filed a writ petition being WP(C) No.3874/2022 before this
Court seeking a direction to the respondents to conduct the recruitment for
the said post without any delay and to relax the upper age limit. According
to petitioners, this Court vide order dated 08.03.2022 in the said petition
had directed the respondent No.1 to act upon the said Office
Memorandum No.F.No.43014/03/2019-Estt(B) dated 21.01.2020 issued
by the Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances and Pensions,
Department of Personnel & Training within a period of six weeks. Even
thereafter, when no notification regarding filling-up of vacancies of the
post in question was issued by the respondents, the petitions preferred a
Contempt Petition being CONT.CAS(C) No.531/2022 against the
respondents, wherein this Court vide order dated 30.08.2022, deferred the
W.P.(C) 90/2023 & W.P.(C) 301/2023                                       Page 3 of 14
orders in view of pendency of a Review Petition No.192/2022 filed by the
respondents. In the said review petition, the respondents admitted that
vacancies for the post of Head Constable (Ministerial) were lying vacant
for the years 2018, 2019, 2020 and 2021. The said review petition was
disposed of by this Court vide order dated 28.10.2022 with directions to
the respondents to complete the recruitment process for the said vacancies
within eight months.
6.      Learned counsel for the petitioners strenuously submitted that the
main reason for petitioners being age barred is the fact that the respondent
No.1 did not conduct any examination for recruitment to the post of Head
Constable (Ministerial) for the year 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020 and 2021.
7.      Learned counsel further submitted that the examinations for the
post of Head Constable (Ministerial) for the year 2020 and 2021 could not
be conducted possibly due to Covid-19 pandemic, however, if the
petitioners      are    not     permitted       to    appear     in the recruitment
process/examination for the said post for the year 2022, they would be
deprived of their legitimate rights under Article 14 of the Constitution of
8.      Learned counsel further submitted that relaxing the upper age limit
as “One Time Measure” of the petitioner shall enable them to appear in
the examination for the post of Head Constable (Ministerial) for the year
9.      Learned counsel for petitioners also submitted that Rule 9 of
Central Reserve Police Force Act, 1949 gives power to the respondent
W.P.(C) 90/2023 & W.P.(C) 301/2023                                       Page 4 of 14
No.2 to relax the rules. The Rule 9 Central Reserve Police Force is
reproduced as under:
“9. Power to relax.- Where the Central Government is of
the opinion that it is necessary or expedient so to do, it may,
by order, for reason to be recorded in writing, relax any of
the provisions of these rules with respect to any class or
category of persons.”
10.     To strengthen his arguments, learned counsel for the petitioners
submitted that in a recent advertisement for recruitment to the post of
Constable (GD) in CAPF, three years age relaxation has been given to all
categories of the candidates as “One Time Measure”.
11.     Learned counsel for petitioners had also drawn attention of this
Court to advertisement dated 22.04.2022 issued by Directorate General,
SSB, Ministry of Home Affairs, Government of India for selection to the
post of Assistant Commandant (GD) in CAPFs through Limited
the said advertisement, in para 4 (a), the upper age limit mentioned is 35
years which is reproduced as under:
“4. (a) Age:-          The upper age limit for appearing in the
LDCE will not be more than 35 (Thirty Five) years as on 1 st
August of particular vacancy year. The cut off date for
calculation of age of candidates for different vacancy years
will be as under:-
W.P.(C) 90/2023 & W.P.(C) 301/2023                                   Page 5 of 14
12.     Learned counsel for petitioner further submitted that pursuant to
publication of the advertisement in question, petitioners had made a
representation to the respondents seeking relaxation of upper age,
however, no response thereto has been received. Hence, the petitioners
have approached this Court seeking a direction to the respondents for
giving minimum four years age relaxation to all the categories enabling
them to appear in the examination.
13.     On the other hand, learned Central Government Standing Counsel
(CGSC) submitted that the last recruitment for the post of Head Constable
(Ministerial) was conducted in the year 2016 and completed in September,
2017 and also the Ministry of Home Affairs vide its Order
No.45020/1/2019/Legal-I dated 19/08/2019 increased the superannuation
age from 57 to 60 years. Learned CGSC further submitted that since there
was no superannuation between 2019 and 2021, therefore, no vacancies
against the retirement for the said period fell out.
14.     Learned CGSC also submitted that the age limit for recruitment to
the post of Constable (GD) is from 18 years to 23 years which is relaxable
up to 05 years for candidates belonging to Scheduled Castes
(SC)/Scheduled Tribes (ST) and 03 years for candidates belonging to
Other Backward Castes (OBC) candidates. Likewise, the age limit for the
post of Head Constable (Ministerial) is from 18 years to 25 years which is
relaxable up to 05 years for candidates belonging to SC/ST and 3 years for
candidates belonging to OBC candidates.
15.     Learned CGSC further submitted that due to unprecedented Covid-
19 pandemic, the Ministry of Home Affairs, Government of India vide
W.P.(C) 90/2023 & W.P.(C) 301/2023                                Page 6 of 14
letter No.45023/29/2021–Pers Policy-Part(1)/760 dated 26.07.2022 has
granted 03 years age relaxation beyond respective prescribed upper age
limit for all categories of candidates as a “One-Time Measure” to the
candidates of all categories for the recruitment of Constable (GD) in
CAPFs, SSF and Rifleman(GD), Assam Rifles Examination 2022 and
2023. The age limit for recruitment for the post of Constable (GD) has
been raised from 23 years to 26 years for General candidates, from 23
years to 29 years for OBC candidates and from 23 years to 31 years for
SC/ST candidates. If age relaxation is granted as per the aforesaid order
dated 26.07.2022, the age limit for the post of Head Constable (M) will be
raised from 25 years to 28 years for General candidates, from 25 years to
31 years for OBC candidates and from 25 years to 33 years for SC/ST
candidates. Lastly, learned CGSC submitted that the relief sought in
these petition deserves to be rejected.
16.     In rebuttal, learned counsel appearing on behalf of petitioners
submitted that it cannot be presumed without bringing any data on record
with regard to superannuation age as there fell out no vacancies on
superannuation. Even otherwise, the vacancies have arisen in each year
from 2018 to 2022 and because the respondents arbitrarily did not conduct
any recruitment process and it is only after the directions passed by this
Court, this recruitment drive has commenced. Therefore, the petitioners
who have been striving to get recruitment in CRPF cannot be deprived of
their legitimate right by being over age. Also, CRPF Rule 9 itself permits
relaxation of rules, therefore, it would be in the interest of justice to direct
W.P.(C) 90/2023 & W.P.(C) 301/2023                                  Page 7 of 14
the respondents to relax the upper age limit of the petitioners to appear in
the examination for the post in question.
17.     Upon hearing learned counsel representing both the sides and on
perusal of the material placed before this Court, we find that in the
advertisement dated 27.12.2022, the age limit is from 18 to 25 years. The
relevant portion of the said advertisement is as under:
7.1 Age limit of candidates should be from 18 to 25
years as on closing date of receipt of application i.e.
25/01/2023 i.e. candidate should not born before
26/01/1998 or after 25/01/2005.
7.2 Permissible relaxation in upper age limit for
different categories and category codes for
claiming age relaxation will be as follows:
03.    Ex-servicemen                  3 years after deduction
of the military service
W.P.(C) 90/2023 & W.P.(C) 301/2023                                      Page 8 of 14
04.    Central Government             who have rendered not
Servants                       less than 3 years
18.     There is no dispute to the fact that the respondent No.1, for the
reasons best known to it, have been avoiding recruitment process since the
year 2017 for the appointment to the post of Head Constable (Ministerial).
W.P.(C) 90/2023 & W.P.(C) 301/2023                                        Page 9 of 14
This Court is conscious of the fact that during the period 2019-2020, the
appointments in Government Departments/Organisations were put to hold,
however, we cannot ignore the fact that all the Government
Departments/Organisations have been fully functional since the year
2021. It is relevant to mention here that despite petitioners having made
various representations to the respondents for conducting examination,
like making representations to the Hon‟ble President of India, Hon‟ble
Prime Minister of India and to all the competent authorities, the
respondents have not paid any heed to it. Even despite directions of this
Court vide order dated 08.03.2022 in WP(C) No.3874/2022, the
respondents did not commence recruitment process. It is only when the
petitioners therein approached this Court in contempt proceedings, the
respondents have now published vacancies for the post of Head Constable
(Ministerial) in the year 2022 after a lapse of six years.
19.     At this juncture, we do not hesitate to observe that the lethargy and
delay in publishing the vacancies for the recruitment to the said post, after
a lapse of six years, has curtailed the future prospects of candidates like
the petitioners who are willing and striving for appointment in Forces.
20.     The Hon‟ble Supreme Court in Civil Appeal No 2016 of 2022
(Arising out of SLP (C) No 4452 of 2022) titled as High Court of Delhi
Vs. Devina Sharma, wherein petitioner had sought relaxation in upper age
limit for appearing in Delhi Judicial Service Examination and Delhi
Higher Judicial Service Examination- 2022, on the plea that if High Court
of Delhi had conducted examination in the year 2020 and 2021, such
W.P.(C) 90/2023 & W.P.(C) 301/2023                                 Page 10 of 14
candidates would have been within the age limit in the said years,
observed and held as under:-
“18. The time schedule for conducting the recruitment
process to the judicial service has been stipulated by
the judgment of this Court in Malik Mazhar Sultan (3)
vs Uttar Pradesh Public Service Commission 6 . The
object and purpose of the directions of this Court has
been to ensure that the 6 (2008) 17 SCC 703 CA
2016/2022 10 recruitment process for the judicial
service is conducted on schedule every year, subject to
the rules of each High Court. The High Court of Delhi
held its last examination for recruitment to DJS in
2019. Admittedly, no examination has been held in
2020 or in 2021. The examination for 2020 could not
be conducted since the process for 2019 was still to be
completed. The examination for 2020 could not be held
due to the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic. In this
backdrop, since the examination was not conducted for
two recruitment years, the High Court has after
considering the issue stated before this Court through
the learned senior counsel that as a one-time measure,
this Court may accept the suggestion that candidates
who would have qualified for the examinations were
they to be held on schedule for recruitment years 2020
and 2021 in terms of the rules as they then stood, may
be permitted to appear for the ensuing examinations.
19. Having regard to the fact that the recruitment
examination for DJS has been last held in 2019 and
two recruitment years have elapsed in the meantime,
we are of the view that the suggestion of the High
Court should be accepted for this year. The
consequence of the acceptance of the suggestion by this
Court, would be that candidates who would have
fulfilled the upper age limit of 32 years, for the
recruitment years 2020 and 2021 would be eligible to
participate in the examination for the ensuing
recruitment year 2022. The age bar which they would
W.P.(C) 90/2023 & W.P.(C) 301/2023                                Page 11 of 14
now encounter is not of their own volition. The real
element of hardship faced by such candidates has been
remedied by the CA 2016/2022 11 High Court and
there is no reason for this court not to accept the
suggestion. The examination cannot however, be
postponed indefinitely nor can the candidates who
have applied be left in a state of uncertainty. The
existing candidates can have no grievance by the
widening of the competition. In order to facilitate this
exercise, we accept the suggestion of the High Court
that the last date for the receipt of application forms
shall be extended to 3 April 2022 and the examination
shall be held on 24 April 2022. We direct that no
impediment shall be caused in the conduct of the
examination and no court shall issue any order of stay
at variance with or contrary to the above directions of
this Court.
28. During the course of the hearing, this Court has
been apprised of the fact that several applicants for the
higher judicial service examination would have
qualified in terms of the upper age limit of 45 years in
2020 or, as the case may be, 2021. As a matter of fact,
Mr A D N Rao indicates that he has instructions to the
effect that some of those candidates may already have
or would be in the process of moving petitions before
the High Court. The CA 2016/2022 17 reasons which
have weighed with this Court in allowing the High
Court, as a one-time measure, to permit candidates for
the DJS examination who had qualified in terms of the
upper age limit of 32 years during the recruitment
years 2020 and 2021, should on a parity of reasoning
be extended to candidates for the DHJS examination
who would have qualified in terms of the upper age
limit of 45 years during the recruitment years 2020 and
2021 during which no examinations could take place
for the reasons which have been noticed earlier.”
W.P.(C) 90/2023 & W.P.(C) 301/2023                                 Page 12 of 14
21.     This Court has no contrary view in the facts of the present case as
the one taken by the Supreme Court in High Court of Delhi Vs. Devina
Sharma (Supra). In the facts and circumstances of this case and in view
of the fact that the candidates like the petitioners have been deprived to
seek recruitment in CRPF for no fault of theirs, due to non-conduct of
examination by the CRPF and in view of the fact that after 2016 till 2022,
no examination for the post of Head Constable (Ministerial) by respondent
No.1 was held, we are of the opinion that the petitioners and similarly
situated personnel cannot be deprived of the right to appear in the
examination. Also when Rule 9 of CRPF grants the power to relax the
Rules wherever necessary, in the interest of justice, we find that relaxation
of three years in the upper age limit can be given to the candidates who
wish to apply pursuant to the advertisement in question. It goes without
saying that even if upper age to appear in the said examination is relaxed,
the appointments to the said posts would only be governed only after the
candidates are successful in the recruitment process i.e. by passing out
necessary criteria of Computer Based Test, Skill Test, Physical Standard
22.     In view of aforesaid observations and in the light of the fact that the
last date of applying for the said post is 25.01.2023, we hereby direct the
respondents to issue a Corrigendum on or before 25.01.2023 declaring
relaxation of age of 03 years as a „one time measure‟ and also extending
the date of inviting applications for the post in question.
