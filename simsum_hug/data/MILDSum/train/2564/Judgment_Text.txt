2     While considering a challenge by the State of Orissa to the judgment and order
dated 14 November 2012 of the Orissa Administrative Tribunal 1 in OA No 163 of
2008, the High Court, by its order dated 14 February 2019, dismissed the
petition with the following order:
“Heard learned counsel for the parties.
By way of this writ petition, the petitioners have challenged the
judgment and order dated 14.11.2012 passed by the Orissa
Administrative Tribunal, Bhubaneswar in OA No. 163 of2008.
Taking into consideration the opposite party is working for a
period of three decades, it will not be appropriate for us to
disturb the findings of the Tribunal.
Accordingly, the writ petition stands dismissed.
However, this will not be treated as precedent.”
3    Ex facie, there has been no application of mind by the High Court to the grounds
of challenge or to the submissions. In fact, the concluding line of the order of
the High Court indicates that the decision will not be treated as a precedent.
This was an inappropriate manner of disposing of a substantive petition under
Article 226 of the Constitution since the High Court is duty bound to apply its
mind to whether the judgment of the Tribunal is sustainable on facts and law.
4    In the above background, we are constrained to set aside the judgment of the
High Court and remit the proceedings back for a fresh decision. Accordingly, the
impugned order dated 14 February 2019 is set aside and Writ Petition (C) No
6658 of 2014 is restored to the file of the High Court of Orissa for fresh disposal.
5    However, having regard to the fact that the proceedings before the Tribunal were
instituted in 2008, we request the High Court to endeavour an expeditious
disposal, preferably within a period of three months from the date of receipt of a
certified copy of this order.
6    The appeal is accordingly disposed of.
7    Pending application, if any, stands disposed of.
