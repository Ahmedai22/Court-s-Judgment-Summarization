1.    Petitioner has preferred an application under section 438 Cr.P.C. read
with Section 482/483 Cr.P.C. for grant of anticipatory bail in FIR No.
619/2021 dated 24.12.2021, under Section 377 IPC and Section 6 of POCSO
Act registered at P.S. Janakpuri, New Delhi. During the course of
investigation, Section 376AB IPC has also been invoked in the proceedings.
2.     In brief, as per the case of the prosecution, on 23.12.2021, PCR call
vide DD no. 67A was received at PS Janakpuri, New Delhi wherein it was
recorded “caller lady ke husband aur saas maarpeet kar rahe hain aur inki
beti ke saath bhi galat kam karne kii koshish ki hain”. The call was marked

to SI Rohtash who reached the spot, wherein it was revealed that
complainant along with her daughter had gone to P.S. Janakpuri.               The
complainant (wife of the petitioner) alongwith her daughter aged 5 years
(victim) reached the police station and filed a written complaint against the
petitioner alleging that her husband had touched his penis with her
daughter‟s vagina and had asked her daughter to taste his penis. It is further
the case of the complainant that petitioner forcefully made the victim taste
his penis but victim did not like the taste of the penis. By aforesaid time,
complainant reached, on which the petitioner started fighting with the
complainant. Further, the petitioner threatened the victim not to disclose the
incident to the complainant. The complainant also alleged that the incident
took place on 21st , 22nd & 23rd December, 2021.
3.     The medical examination of the victim was conducted on the night
intervening 23rd/24th December 2021 and the present FIR was accordingly
registered.
4.     During the course of investigation, the statement of victim “K” was
recorded under section 164 Cr.P.C. The clothes and mask of the victim “K”
were taken into police possession and sent to FSL for expert opinion.
However, the blood sample of the victim which was required for
examination as per the communication received from FSL, has not been
provided till date by the complainant, despite information being received by
5.     Vide impugned order dated 27.01.2022, the application for
anticipatory bail filed on behalf of the petitioner, was declined in view of bar
under sub-Section (4) of Section 438 of Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973.
6.     Learned counsel for the petitioner contended that petitioner is a young

Mechanical Engineer aged 34 years and got married to the complainant on
02.12.2014. Further, both were living separately since May, 2015 due to
matrimonial differences. A complaint was lodged by wife of the petitioner
with DCP, CAW Cell, Nanakpura on 11.01.2016 which culminated into
registration of FIR No.107/2017, under section 498A/406/323/34 IPC and
Section 3 & 4 of Dowry Prohibition Act on 17.02.2017 at PS: Ambedkar
Nagar.      A girl child (victim) was born out of the said wedlock on
22.01.2016. Petition for divorce was further filed by the petitioner on
09.09.2016 and proceedings under Domestic Violence Act were initiated on
behalf of the wife of the petitioner on 06.05.2016. In FIR No. 107/2017, the
charges were framed under sections 498A/406/323/34 IPC and Section 3 & 4
of Dowry Prohibition Act against the petitioner and his parents.              The
aforesaid proceedings finally culminated into a compromise in November
2020.     In the meantime, the wife of the petitioner got enrolled as an
Advocate in August 2019.          In view of the aforementioned settlement
between the parties, proceedings under the D.V. Act were withdrawn. The
proceedings under section 498A/406 IPC in respect of FIR no. 107/2017 are
still pending before the learned Trial Court. The parties thereafter started
living together w.e.f. 25.12.2020 in tenanted premises.
The aforesaid factual position has been detailed to reflect that the
parties had multiple litigations prior to lodging of the present FIR.
7.      Learned counsel for the petitioner further pressed for anticipatory bail
on the following grounds:-
(i)     That Section 376AB was wrongly invoked by the Investigating
Agency during the course of trial at the behest of learned Additional
Sessions Judge and it is contended that no such directions could have
Digitally Signed       BAIL  APPLN 565/2022                                                  Page 3 of 15
(ii)    That vide impugned order, the learned Additional Sessions Judge
incorrectly inferred that the present application for anticipatory bail
was barred under Section 438 of Cr.P.C. To buttress the arguments,
reference was further made to Section 42 of POCSO Act, Section 376,
376AB IPC. It was further submitted that the aforesaid amendment
incorporating sub-Section (4) of Section 438 Cr.P.C., did not
intentionally incorporate Section 6 of POCSO Act within its ambit and
as such application for anticipatory bail is not barred under Section
438 Cr.P.C. It was pointed out that all the amendments had been
brought into effect simultaneously in 2018.
(iii)   That in the FIR, the incident is stated to have occurred between 4.00 -
5.00 pm on 23.12.2021 and the information was received at 5.00 pm
(1700 hours) as recorded in the FIR. However, subsequently, the
stand has been modified by the complainant after it was pointed out to
the Investigating Agency that no such incident had occurred as the
petitioner was present at his parental home at the relevant time and is
duly supported by the CCTV footage.
It is further urged that the timings provided by the complainant
are discrepant since at 2.30 pm on 23.12.2021, the victim was left with
the mother of the petitioner and thereafter, the petitioner had left for
DDU Hospital for medical treatment of the complainant. Further, they
returned back to the parental home, wherein the victim was picked up
and proceeded to their tenanted premises.          The CCTV footage
provided to the investigating agency depicts that around 5.30 pm, the
petitioner alongwith the complainant and victim were leaving for their
Digitally Signed       BAIL  APPLN 565/2022                                                  Page 4 of 15
tenanted premises. As such, it is claimed that entire incident has been
framed and fabricated by the complainant to settle the scores and the
child has been used as a tool in the litigation.
(iv)   That the occurrence is alleged to have taken place in the tenanted
premises of the petitioner and the complainant, on 21st, 22nd & 23rd
December, 2021 but the matter was never reported to the police on 21st
and 22nd December, 2021 and neither any timings of the incident have
been reflected in the FIR.
In the aforesaid context, it is also urged that the present FIR is
in retaliation to another incident between the parties on 21.12.2021
which was reported by the petitioner to the police (i.e. two days prior
to the present complaint).
(v)    Reliance is further placed upon following judgments in support of the

8.     On the other hand, the application has been vehemently opposed by
learned APP for the State alongwith learned counsel for the complainant. It
is submitted that though the incident was initially reported to have been
committed between 4:00-5:00 pm as recorded in the FIR but a
supplementary statement of the complainant was recorded wherein the
incident was clarified to have occurred between 4:00-6:00 pm on
23.12.2021. It is further fairly admitted by learned APP after instructions
from IO that the stand taken by the petitioner that he was not present at the
premises in question, but had visited his parents and returned at 5.34 pm,
was found to be correct but subject to correction of timings by about 10
minutes as supported by CCTV footage.
During the course of hearing, learned APP also referred to the
statement of victim recorded on 24.12.2021 by the learned MM. However,
on a query raised by this Court in the aforesaid context regarding the
statement of victim that “papa ne kal ye nahi kiya tha, usse pehlewale tin din
kiya tha”, it was submitted by the learned APP that possibly the victim/child
being of tender age had not been able to differentiate the dates. It was
further contended that the petition under section 438 Cr.P.C. is not
Digitally Signed       BAIL APPLN 565/2022                                                Page 7 of 15
maintainable in view of amendment brought out in section 438 Cr.P.C. in
9.     I have given considered thought to the contentions raised.
(i)    Learned counsel for the petitioner relying upon the authorities as
referred to above, contended that Section 376AB IPC could not have been
directed to be invoked by the learned Additional Sessions Judge during the
pendency of bail application as the said section had not been invoked by the
investigating agency and the FIR was initially registered only under Section
377 IPC read with Section 6 of POCSO Act.
(ii)   The observations of the learned Trial Court in para 9 & 10 of order
dated 27.01.2022 in aforesaid context are relevant to be noticed:-
“9. Ld. Additional Prosecutor for the State, Ld. Counsel for
the complainant and Ld. Counsel for the applicant sought
sometime to revert on this issue.      During the subsequent
hearing on the application, Ld. Counsel for the applicant
ambitiously put forth her stance that in the present FIR,
offence u/s 377 IPC and Section 6 of POCSO Act have been
invoked where as the prohibition introduced by the legislature
is in respect of Section 376 IPC.       On the contrary, Ld.
Additional Prosecutor for the state countered this submission
that the contents of the FIR reveals the commission of offence
u/s 376AB IPC and even if the same has not been specifically
invoked, the court is not precluded from considering the same.
Upon this submission, a report was called from the
Digitally Signed       BAIL APPLN 565/2022                                                 Page 8 of 15
investigating officer and SHO concerned. SHO, P.S. Janak
Puri, interalia, replied as under:-
“In this regard, it is humbly submitted that the investigation of the
case has been handed over to W/SI Pramila on 21.01.2022 and
section 376(AB) IPC has been invoked without further delay in this
case. Further, it is stated that inadvertently the section 376(AB)
IPC was not invoked at the time of registration of FIR and no
malafide intention was there for not invoking this section at the
initial stage.
I, the undersigned, tender my unconditional apologies to the court
for the inconvenience caused due to above said human error. I
assure the court that such type of mistake will not be repeated in
future and I will remain more careful in the court matters. It is,
therefore, requested that the explanation called from undersigned
may please be filed in view of above submission.”
10. The factual position which emerged therein is that
Section 376AB IPC has been added in the FIR and even if we
assume the present application has been filed under the
relevant section which have been invoked in the FIR coupled
with recently added section 376AB IPC, the statutory
provision introduced by the legislature by way of the proviso
u/s 438 Cr.P.C. proscribes this court to entertain and dispose
of the present application on merits………”
(iii)  It is well settled that there is statutory right of police to investigate the
circumstances of an alleged cognizable crime without requiring any authority
from the judicial authorities. As such, it is the bounden duty of the police to
investigate into an offence and bring the offender to book by invoking the
Digitally Signed       BAIL  APPLN 565/2022                                                            Page 9 of 15
correct sections in law. However, if an error in not invoking the correct
section comes to the notice of the Trial Court/MM at the stage of
investigation, it cannot be deemed that the concerned judicial officer
oversteps his jurisdiction in pointing out the error/deficiency though the
power to invoke the relevant sections of law rests with the Investigating
Agency. However, the learned Additional Sessions Judge could not have
specified the rank of the officer by whom the investigation is to be
conducted. There is no dispute as to the proposition that Section 41 of the
Code of Criminal Procedure gives discretion to the police officer who may
without any order from a Magistrate and even without a warrant arrest any
person in the situations enumerated in that section and further at the stage of
investigation, the Court has no role to play in this regard. The directions by
the learned Additional Sessions Judge pointing out the invocation of Section
376AB, cannot be deemed to be an unwarranted interference with
investigation or exercise of statutory power by the Investigating Agency.
I am further of the considered opinion that the offence could not have
been diluted by the prosecution out of sheer ignorance, as on the face of
record the offence under Section 376AB IPC is manifestly attracted in the
facts and circumstances of the case.
The proposition of law as referred in the authorities cited by the learned
counsel for the petitioner is not disputed but the same does not specifically
cover the proposition involved in the present case. The invocation of correct
section by the Investigating Agency on pointing out by the learned
Additional Sessions Judge during the stage of investigation is not barred.
Digitally Signed       BAIL APPLN 565/2022                                                   Page 10 of 15
10.    The learned counsel for the petitioner next challenges the finding of
the learned Trial Court that the Court is proscribed to deal with application
under Section 438 Cr.P.C. for grant of anticipatory bail in view of Criminal
It may be noticed that Criminal Law Amendment Act, 2018 was
brought for the protection of girls from heinous crime of rape and to save the
woman from the horrifying state of sexual assault. Correspondingly, the
amendment was also brought in other sections relating to Indian Penal Code,
Code of Criminal Procedure, Indian Evidence Act, 1872, Section 438 and
Section 439 of Cr.P.C. alongwith changes in Section 42 of POCSO Act
dealing with the alternative punishment. The changes in the penal laws were
provided specifically for the welfare of the women and children, keeping in
view the rising crime rate and to provide for a deterrent punishment.
Sub-section (4) of Section 438 Cr.P.C. was inserted vide Criminal
Amendment Act, 2018 w.e.f. 21.04.2018 and provides that nothing in this
section shall apply to any case involving the arrest of any person on
accusation of having committed an offence under sub section (3) of Section
376 or Section 376AB or Section 376DA or Section 376DB of the Indian
It may further be noticed that Section 376AB IPC was also introduced
vide aforesaid amendment and provides that whoever commits rape on a
woman under twelve years of age, shall be punished with rigorous
imprisonment for a term which shall not be less than twenty years, but which
may extend to imprisonment for life, which shall mean imprisonment for the
remainder of that person‟s natural life, and with fine or with death.
Digitally Signed       BAIL APPLN 565/2022                                                   Page 11 of 15
Also, Section 5 of POCSO Act, 2012 defines aggravated penetrative
sexual assault and Section 6 provides punishment for the same with rigorous
imprisonment for a term which shall not be less than 20 years, but which
may extend to imprisonment for life, which shall mean imprisonment for the
remainder of natural life of that person, and shall also be liable to fine, or
with both.
A bare perusal of Section 6 and Section 376AB IPC reflects that
punishment provided under Section 376AB IPC and Section 6 of POCSO
Act, 2012 is same and the offence in the present case is covered, both under
Section 6 of POCSO Act as well as Section 376AB IPC.
It may further be observed that Section 42 of the Protection of
Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012 (POSCO Act) was also amended
w.e.f. 21.04.2018 and provides that where an act or omission constitutes an
offence punishable under this Act and also under sections 166A, 354A,
376D, 376DA, 376DB], [376E, section 509 of the Indian Penal Code (45 of
1860) or section 67B of the Information Technology Act, 2000 (21 of
2000)], then, notwithstanding anything contained in any law for the time
being in force, the offender found guilty of such offence shall be liable to
punishment under this Act or under the Indian Penal Code as provides for
punishment which is greater in degree.
It is pertinent to note that Section 42A of POCSO Act provides that
the provision of this Act shall be in addition to and not in derogation of the
provisions of any other law for the time being in force and, in case of any
Digitally Signed       BAIL APPLN 565/2022                                                 Page 12 of 15
inconsistency, the provisions of this Act shall have overriding effect on the
provisions of any such law to the extent of the inconsistency.
In view of aforesaid legal position, by virtue of Section 42 of POCSO
Act, if the offence is punishable under POCSO Act as well as Section
376AB IPC and if the offender is found guilty of such offence, he shall be
liable to punishment either under POCSO Act or under the IPC, whichsoever
provides for punishment greater in degree. It cannot be inferred that the rigor
of sub-Section (4) of Section 438 Cr.P.C. stands obliterated at the stage of
bail since offender stands charged with both Section 376AB IPC as well as
Section 6 of POCSO Act and may be punished on conviction under Section 6
of POCSO Act instead of Section 376AB IPC. The purpose of Section 42 is
to ensure that an act constituting offence under two different enactments
does not lead to double punishment for the same act constituting an offence.
I am accordingly of the opinion that in view of sub-Section (4) of
Section 438 Cr.P.C., the application for anticipatory bail is not maintainable
before the learned Trial Court and the observations to this extent cannot be
faulted with.    The legislative intention is clear and implicit in placing
embargo for grant of anticipatory bail in cases referred under sub-Section (4)
of Section 438 Cr.P.C.
11.    Considering the background of series of litigations between the
petitioner and the complainant, who is the mother of victim and a lawyer, the
possibility of false allegations for purpose of achieving ulterior motives
through tutoring of a minor child cannot be ruled out as the consequences of
prosecuting a father of a victim under rape are very serious, since the person
Digitally Signed       BAIL APPLN 565/2022                                                  Page 13 of 15
comes down in the eyes of society and is virtually shunned from the main
stream of life.
However, at the same time, in case of allegations of offences against a
minor victim, the Courts have to be sensitive to their plight when faced with
a situation wherein allegations have been lodged by mother of the victim
against her own husband of having sexual contact with his own daughter and
that too in her presence in the house.
12.    Since the learned counsel for the petitioner has disputed the
occurrence of any such alleged incident in the light of discrepancy in timings
as well as past history of the matrimonial disputes between the parties, the
matter needs to be prima facie examined to ascertain if a case under Section
376AB IPC is made out as the frivolity in prosecution should always be
considered and assessed, if the accusations have been made only with the
object of injuring or humiliating the petitioner by ensuring his arrest.
I am of the considered opinion, after perusing the statement of the
victim under Section 164 Cr.P.C., that it may be far too stretched at this
stage to assume that the statement may have been made by the victim aged
about 5 years at the behest of complainant or that the statement was being
used for settling the scores. It cannot be ignored that the future of the victim
child also gets impacted, at least in close circles and any mother would
normally desist from taking the issues which may adversely affect her own
child in social circles. The legal presumption as to the commission of
offence and culpable mental state as legislated under POCSO Act has also to
be kept in perspective while dealing with offences under POCSO Act.

For the foregoing reasons, after considering the totality of the facts
and circumstances, grave nature of allegations and statutory bar placed under
sub-Section (4) of Section 438 Cr.P.C., no grounds for anticipatory bail are
made out.
