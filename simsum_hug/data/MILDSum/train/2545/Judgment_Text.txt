1.       Challenging a summoning order issued by the Court of the Special Judge, Anti-
Corruption, CBI Court No.1, Ghaziabad, on a complaint lodged by the respondent
under Section 45 read with Section 44 of the Prevention of Money-laundering Act,
20021, the petitioner has come up with the above writ petition under Article 32 of the
Constitution of India.
2.       We have heard Ms. Vrinda Grover, learned Counsel for the petitioner and Mr.
Tushar Mehta, learned Solicitor General of India for the respondent.
3.       It is the case of the petitioner that during the pandemic, she initiated
crowdfunding campaign through an online crowdfunding platform named “Ketto” and
ran three campaigns from April 2020 to September 2021. In connection with the same,
the Mumbai Zonal Office of the Enforcement Directorate initiated an enquiry against
the petitioner under the Foreign Exchange Management Act, 19992 through an Office
Order dated 3.8.2021.
4.       It appears that thereafter a complaint was lodged on 7.9.2021 by one Vikas
Sankritayan, claiming to be the founder of Hindu IT Cell, in FIR No.2049/2021 with
Indirapuram Police Station, Ghaziabad for alleged offences under Sections 403, 406,
418 and 420 IPC read with Section 66D of the Information Technology (Amendment)
Act, 2008 and Section 4 of the Black Money Act.
5.       In the meantime, the petitioner received an order under Section 37 of the FEMA
read with Section 133(6) of the Incometax Act, 1961 from the Mumbai Zonal Office of
the Enforcement Directorate seeking certain documents, in addition to the documents
submitted by the petitioner in response to the previous Office Order dated 3.8.2021
issued by the very same Mumbai Zonal Office.
6.       After the petitioner submitted a detailed response to the Mumbai Zonal Office
of the Enforcement Directorate, the Delhi Zone-II Office of the Directorate of
Enforcement registered a complaint in ECIR No.DLZO-II/58/2021 on 11.11.2021, in
the Court of the Special Judge at Ghaziabad. It was stated in the said complaint that
the FIR registered on 7.9.2021 on the file of the Indirapuram Police Station, Ghaziabad
formed the basis for the complaint of the Enforcement Directorate.
7.       After the registration of the aforesaid complaint by the Enforcement Directorate,
the petitioner was summoned to the Delhi Zone-II Office and her statement under
Section 50 of the PMLA was recorded on 15.12.2021.
8.       Thereafter, a provisional order of attachment of the bank account of the
petitioner in HDFC Bank, Koperkhairane Branch, Navi Mumbai, Maharashtra, was
passed by the Directorate of Enforcement on 4.2.2022. Pursuant to the order of
provisional attachment, the Adjudicating Authority issued a show cause notice dated
9.       While things stood thus, a Look out Circular was issued against the petitioner,
but the same was set aside by the High Court of Delhi in a writ petition filed by the
petitioner. In a second writ petition filed by the petitioner, the High Court of Delhi
restrained the Directorate of Enforcement from taking further steps under Section 8 of
the PMLA on the short ground that the validity period of 180 days, of the order of
provisional attachment, came to an end statutorily on 4.8.2022.
10.      Thereafter, the Court of the Special Judge, Anti-Corruption, CBI Court No.1,
Ghaziabad, passed an order on 29.11.2022 taking cognizance of the complaint lodged
by the respondent and summoning the petitioner for appearance on 13.12.2022. Upon
coming to know of the said Summoning Order, the petitioner has come up with the
above writ petition. It is claimed by the petitioner in paragraph 5(v) of the writ petition
that “No summons have yet been received…” by her and that she had annexed a
screenshot of the e-court website reflecting the case details. However, a print out of
the copy of the Summoning Order is filed along with the writ petition.
11.      At the outset, it is made clear by Ms. Vrinda Grover, learned Counsel for the
petitioner that the challenge to the impugned Summoning Order is limited to the
question of territorial jurisdiction alone and that the impugned Summoning Order is
not being challenged on any ground other than the lack of territorial jurisdiction.
12.      In brief, the contention of the learned Counsel for the petitioner is that under
Section 44(1) of the PMLA, an offence punishable under the Act, shall be triable only
by the Special Court constituted for the area in which the offence has been committed.
This is notwithstanding anything contained in the Code of Criminal Procedure, 19733.
Apart from the non-obstante clause with which Section 44(1) begins, Section 71 of the
Act also gives overriding effect to PMLA. Therefore, it is contended by the learned
Counsel for the petitioner that the Special Court in Maharashtra alone could have
taken cognizance of the complaint.
13.      Heavy reliance is placed by the learned Counsel for the petitioner on the opinion
of this Court in paragraphs 353 to 358 of the decision in Vijay Madanlal Choudhary &
Ors. vs. Union of India & Ors.4. It was held in the said decision that the trial of the
offence of money-laundering should proceed before the Special Court constituted for
the area in which the offence of money-laundering has been committed and that in
case the scheduled offence is triable by the Special Court under a special enactment
elsewhere, both the trials need to proceed independently, but in the area where the
offence of moneylaundering has been committed. Paragraphs 356 and 357 of the
decision in Vijay Madanlal Choudhary ( supra) read as follows :
“356. The amendment of 2013 in fact clarifies the dispensation to be followed in regard to
trials concerning offence of money-laundering under this Act and the trial in relation to
scheduled offence including before the Special Court trying such (scheduled) offence. By
virtue of this clause, the trials regarding the offence of money-laundering need to proceed
before the Special Court constituted for the area in which the offence of money-laundering
has been committed. In case the scheduled offence is triable by Special Court under the
special enactment elsewhere, the provision, as amended, makes it amply clear that both the
trials after coming into effect of this Act need to proceed independently, but in the area where
the offence of money-laundering has been committed.
357. In that, the offence of money-laundering ought to proceed for trial only before the Special
Court designated to try money-laundering offences where the offence of money-laundering
has been committed. This is a special enactment and being a later law, would prevail over
any other law for the time being in force in terms of Section 71 of the 2002 Act.”
14.     On facts, it is the contention of the learned Counsel for the petitioner that no
part of the alleged offence of money-laundering was committed within the jurisdiction
of the Special Court, Ghaziabad and that the petitioner’s bank account where the
alleged proceeds of crime were deposited, is located in Navi Mumbai, Maharashtra.
Even the proceedings for the provisional attachment of the bank account were initiated
in New Delhi. Therefore, it is contended that the lodging of the complaint at Ghaziabad
was an abuse of the process of the court and that the same having been done at the
instance of the founder of the Hindu IT Cell, is completely vitiated. It is also contended
that the Court of the Special Judge, ought to have returned the complaint to the
respondent, in terms of Section 201 of the Code of Criminal Procedure and that the
Order taking cognizance is vitiated also by non-application of mind.
15.     In response, it is contended by Mr. Tushar Mehta, learned Solicitor General that
under the scheme of the Act, the complaint of money-laundering should follow the
complaint in respect of the scheduled offence. Since the complaint in respect of the
scheduled offence was registered on 7.9.2021 in Indirapuram Police Station,
Ghaziabad, the respondent necessarily had to lodge the Enforcement Case
Information Report (ECIR) on 11.11.2021, on the file of the same court, within whose
jurisdiction the scheduled offence became triable. In addition, it is contended by the
learned Solicitor General that the petitioner was alleged to have received money
through an online crowdfunding platform and that there were several victims within the
territorial jurisdiction of the Court of the Special Judge who had contributed money. In
other words, it is the contention of the learned Solicitor General that a part of the cause
of action had actually arisen within the jurisdiction of the Court of the Special Judge,
16.     From the rival contentions, it appears that two questions arise for consideration
before us. They are (i) whether the trial of the offence of money-laundering should
follow the trial of the scheduled/predicate offence or vice versa; and (ii) whether the
Court of the Special Judge, Anti-Corruption, CBI Court No.1, Ghaziabad, can be said
to have exercised extra-territorial jurisdiction, even though the offence alleged, was
not committed within the jurisdiction of the said Court.
17.     In order to find an answer to question No.1, it is necessary for us to take note
of a few provisions of the PMLA.
18.     The word “money-laundering” is defined in Section 2(1)(p) of the Act to have
the same meaning as assigned to it in Section 3. Section 3 of the Act makes a person
guilty of the offence of money-laundering, if he (i) directly or indirectly attempts to
indulge; or (ii) knowingly assists or; (iii) knowingly is a party; or (iv) is actually involved
in any process or activity. Such process or activity should be connected to ‘proceeds
of crime’ including its concealment or possession or acquisition or use. In addition, a
person involved in such process or activity connected to proceeds of crime, should be
projecting or claiming it as untainted property. The Explanation under Section 3 makes
it clear that even if the involvement is in one or more of the following activities or
processes, namely, (i) concealment; (ii) possession; (iii) acquisition; (iv) use; (v)
projecting it as untainted property; or (vi) claiming it as untainted property, the offence
of moneylaundering will be made out.
19.    Thus, Section 3 comprises of two essential limbs, namely, (i) involvement in any
process or activity; and (ii) connection of such process or activity to the proceeds of
crime. The expression “proceeds of crime” is defined in Section 2(1)(u) to mean any
property derived or obtained, directly or indirectly, by any person as a result of criminal
activity relating to a scheduled offence or the value of such property or where such
property is taken or held outside the country, then the property equivalent in value
held within the country or abroad.
20.    PMLA provides for a two-pronged approach, one for dealing with the proceeds
of crime and the other for dealing with the person guilty of the offence of money-
laundering. While Chapter III and Chapter VI prescribe the procedure for dealing with
the proceeds of crime, through a process of attachment, confirmation through
adjudication and an appellate remedy to the Special Tribunal, Chapter VII deals with
the prosecution of the money launderers by Special Courts.
21.    Section 43(1) of the Act provides for the constitution of Special Courts, by the
Central Government, in consultation with the Chief Justice of the High Court. Sub-
section (2) of Section 43 empowers a Special Court constituted under Section 43(1),
also to try an offence other than the offence punishable under Section 4 of the PMLA,
with which the accused may be charged at the same trial under the Cr.P.C. In other
words, a Special Court is constituted under Section 43(1) primarily for the purpose of
trying an offence punishable under Section 4. But sub-section (2) of Section 43
confers an additional jurisdiction upon such a Special Court to try any other offence
with which the accused may be charged at the same trial. Section 43 reads as follows:-
“43. Special Courts.—(1) The Central Government, in consultation with the Chief Justice of
the High Court, shall, for trial of offence punishable under section 4, by notification, designate
one or more Courts of Session as Special Court or Special Courts for such area or areas or
for such case or class or group of cases as may be specified in the notification.
Explanation.—In this sub-section, “High Court” means the High Court of the State in which a
Sessions Court designated as Special Court was functioning immediately before such
(2) While trying an offence under this Act, a Special Court shall also try an offence, other than
an offence referred to in sub-section (1), with which the accused may, under the Code of
Criminal Procedure, 1973 (2 of 1974), be charged at the same trial.”
22.    Section 44 deals with the question of territorial jurisdiction of the Special Court,
constituted under Section 43(1). At the outset, Section 44(1) takes note of two different
contingencies, namely, (i) cases where the scheduled offence as well as the offence
of money-laundering are committed within the territorial jurisdiction of the same
Special Court constituted under Section 43(1); and (ii) cases where the Court which
has taken cognizance of the scheduled offence, is other than the Special Court which
has taken cognizance of the complaint of the offence of moneylaundering. Section
“44. Offences triable by Special Courts.—
(1) Notwithstanding anything contained in the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (2 of
(a)     an offence punishable under section 4 and any scheduled offence connected to the
offence under that section shall be triable by the Special Court constituted for the area in
which the offence has been committed:
Provided that the Special Court, trying a scheduled offence before the commencement of this
Act, shall continue to try such scheduled offence; or;
(b)     a Special Court may, upon a complaint made by an authority authorised in this behalf
under this Act take cognizance of offence under section 3, without the accused being
Provided that after conclusion of investigation, if no offence of money-laundering is made out
requiring filing of such complaint, the said authority shall submit a closure report before the
(c)     if the court which has taken cognizance of the scheduled offence is other than the
Special Court which has taken cognizance of the complaint of the offence of money-
laundering under sub-clause (b), it shall, on an application by the authority authorised to file
a complaint under this Act, commit the case relating to the scheduled offence to the Special
Court and the Special Court shall, on receipt of such case proceed to deal with it from the
stage at which it is committed.
(d)     a Special Court while trying the scheduled offence or the offence of money-laundering
shall hold trial in accordance with the provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (2
of 1974), as it applies to a trial before a Court of Session.
Explanation.—For the removal of doubts, it is clarified that,—
(i)     the jurisdiction of the Special Court while dealing with the offence under this Act, during
investigation, enquiry or trial under this Act, shall not be dependent upon any orders passed
in respect of the scheduled offence, and the trial of both sets of offences by the same court
shall not be construed as joint trial;
(ii)    the complaint shall be deemed to include any subsequent complaint in respect of
further investigation that may be conducted to bring any further evidence, oral or
documentary, against any accused person involved in respect of the offence, for which
complaint has already been filed, whether named in the original complaint or not.”
23.     What is dealt with by Section 44(1)(a) is a situation where there is no
complication. Section 44(1)(a) lays down the most fundamental rule relating to
territorial jurisdiction, by providing that an offence punishable under Section 4 of the
PMLA and any scheduled offence connected to the same shall be triable by the
Special Court constituted for the area in which the offence has been committed. It is
relevant to note that Section 44(1)(a) uses the expression “offence” in three places in
contradistinction to the expression “scheduled offence” used only once. This usage is
not without significance. In all three places where the word “offence” alone is used, it
connotes the offence of money-laundering. The place where the expression
“scheduled offence” is used, it connotes the predicate offence. By prescribing that an
offence punishable under Section 4 of the PMLA and any scheduled offence
connected to the same shall be triable by the Special Court constituted for the area in
which “the offence” has been committed, Section 44(1)(a) makes it crystal clear that
it is the Special Court constituted under Section 43(1), which will be empowered to try
even the scheduled offence connected to the same.
24.     After mapping out/laying down such a general but fundamental rule, the Act
then proceeds to deal with a more complicated situation in Section 44(1)(c). The
question as to what happens if the Court which has taken cognizance of the scheduled
offence is other than the Special Court which has taken cognizance of the offence of
money-laundering, is what is sought to be answered by clause (c) of sub-section (1)
of Section 44 . If the Court which has taken cognizance of the scheduled offence is
different from the Special Court which has taken cognizance of the offence of money-
laundering, then the authority authorised to file a complaint under PMLA should make
an application to the Court which has taken cognizance of the scheduled offence. On
the application so filed, the Court which has taken cognizance of the scheduled
offence, should commit the case relating to the scheduled offence to the Special Court
which has taken cognizance of the complaint of moneylaundering.
25.     Therefore, it is clear that the trial of the scheduled offence should take place in
the Special Court which has taken cognizance of the offence of money-laundering. In
other words, the trial of the scheduled offence, insofar as the question of territorial
jurisdiction is concerned, should follow the trial of the offence of money-laundering
and not vice versa.
26.     Since the Act contemplates the trial of the scheduled offence and the trial of the
offence of money-laundering to take place only before the Special Court constituted
under Section 43(1), a doubt is prone to arise as to whether all the offences are to be
tried together. This doubt is sought to be removed by Explanation ( i) to Section 44(1).
Explanation (i) clarifies that the trial of both sets of offences by the same Court shall
not be construed as joint trial.
27.     A careful dissection of clauses (a) and (c) of sub-section (1) of Section 44 shows
that they confer primacy upon the Special Court constituted under Section 43(1) of the
PMLA. These two clauses contain two Rules, namely, (i) that the offence punishable
under the PMLA as well as a scheduled offence connected to the same shall be triable
by the Special Court constituted for the area in which the offence of money-laundering
has been committed; and (ii) that if cognizance has been taken by one Court, in
respect of the scheduled offence and cognizance has been taken in respect of the
offence of money-laundering by the Special Court, the Court trying the scheduled
offence shall commit it to the Special Court trying the offence of moneylaundering.
28.     It is only because of the Special Court constituted under Section 43(1) being
conferred primacy that Section 44(1) begins with the words “notwithstanding anything
contained in the Code of Criminal Procedure”. Though the PMLA contains a non-
obstante clause in relation to the Cr.P.C, both in Section 44(1) and in Section 45(1),
there are two other provisions where the Code of Criminal Procedure is specifically
declared to apply to the proceedings before a Special Court. Section 46(1) specifically
makes the provisions of the Cr.P.C applicable to proceedings before a Special Court.
Similarly, Section 65 of the PMLA makes the provisions of Cr.P.C apply to arrest,
search and seizure, attachment, confiscation, investigation, prosecution and all other
proceedings under the Act.
29.     Therefore, it is clear that the provisions of the Cr.P.C. are applicable to all
proceedings under the Act including proceedings before the Special Court, except to
the extent they are specifically excluded. Hence, Section 71 of the PMLA providing an
overriding effect, has to be construed in tune with Section 46(1) and Section 65.
30.     Having taken note of the relevant provisions of the PMLA, which have a bearing
upon the jurisdiction of the Special Court, let us now turn our attention to some of the
provisions of the Cr.P.C, which deal with the question of territorial jurisdiction.
31.      As pointed out by this Court in Kaushik Chatterjee vs. State of Haryana & Ors.5,
the question of territorial jurisdiction in criminal cases revolves around, (i) place of
commission of the offence; or (ii) place where the consequence of an act, both of
which constitute an offence, ensues; or (iii) place where the accused was found; or (iv
) place where the victim was found; or (v) place where the property in respect of which
the offence was committed, was found; or (vi) place where the property forming the
subject-matter of an offence was required to be returned or accounted for, etc.,
according as the case may be.
32.      As articulated in Kaushik Chatterjee (supra), the jurisdiction of a civil court is
limited by territorial as well as pecuniary limits, but the jurisdiction of a criminal court
is determined by (i) the offence; and/or (ii) the offender.
33.      The discussion on the question of territorial jurisdiction in terms of the provisions
of the Cr.P.C can be cut short by extracting the principles culled out in paragraphs 19
to 21 of the decision in Kaushik Chatterjee. They read as follows:
“19. Chapter XIII of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 contains provisions relating to
jurisdiction of criminal courts in inquiries and trials. The Code maintains a distinction between
(i) inquiry; (ii) investigation; and (iii) trial. The words “inquiry” and “investigation” are defined
respectively, in clauses (g) and (h) of Section 2 of the Code.
20. The principles laid down in Sections 177 to 184 of the Code (contained in Chapter XIII)
regarding the jurisdiction of criminal courts in inquiries and trials can be summarised in simple
20.1. Every offence should ordinarily be inquired into and tried by a court within whose local
jurisdiction it was committed. This rule is found in Section 177. The expression “local
jurisdiction” found in Section 177 is defined in Section 2(j) to mean “in relation to a court or
Magistrate, means the local area within which the court or Magistrate may exercise all or any
of its or his powers under the Code”.
20.2. In case of uncertainty about the place in which, among the several local areas, an
offence was committed, the Court having jurisdiction over any of such local areas may inquire
into or try such an offence.
20.3. Where an offence is committed partly in one area and partly in another, it may be
inquired into or tried by a court having jurisdiction over any of such local areas.
20.4. In the case of a continuing offence which is committed in more local areas than one,
it may be inquired into or tried by a court having jurisdiction over any of such local areas.
20.5. Where an offence consists of several acts done in different local areas it may be
inquired into or tried by a court having jurisdiction over any of such local areas. ( Numbers 2
to 5 are traceable to Section 178)
20.6. Where something is an offence by reason of the act done, as well as the consequence
that ensued, then the offence may be inquired into or tried by a court within whose local
jurisdiction either the act was done or the consequence ensued. (Section 179)
20.7. In cases where an act is an offence, by reason of its relation to any other act which is
also an offence, then the first mentioned offence may be inquired into or tried by a court within
whose local jurisdiction either of the acts was done. (Section 180)
20.8. In certain cases such as dacoity, dacoity with murder, escaping from custody, etc., the
offence may be inquired into and tried by a court within whose local jurisdiction either the
offence was committed or the accused person was found.
20.9. In the case of an offence of kidnapping or abduction, it may be inquired into or tried by
a court within whose local jurisdiction the person was kidnapped or conveyed or concealed
or detained.
20.10. The offences of theft, extortion or robbery may be inquired into or tried by a court within
whose local jurisdiction, the offence was committed or the stolen property was possessed,
received or retained.
20.11. An offence of criminal misappropriation or criminal breach of trust may be inquired into
or tried by a court within whose local jurisdiction the offence was committed or any part of the
property was received or retained or was required to be returned or accounted for by the
accused person.
20.12. An offence which includes the possession of stolen property, may be inquired into or
tried by a court within whose local jurisdiction the offence was committed or the stolen
property was possessed by any person, having knowledge that it is stolen property. (Nos. 8
20.13. An offence which includes cheating, if committed by means of letters or
telecommunication messages, may be inquired into or tried by any court within whose local
jurisdiction such letters or messages were sent or received.
20.14. An offence of cheating and dishonestly inducing delivery of the property may be
inquired into or tried by a court within whose local jurisdiction the property was delivered by
the person deceived or was received by the accused person.
20.15. Some offences relating to marriage such as Section 494 IPC (marrying again during
the lifetime of husband or wife) and Section 495 IPC (committing the offence under Section
494 with concealment of former marriage) may be inquired into or tried by a court within
whose local jurisdiction the offence was committed or the offender last resided with the
spouse by the first marriage. (Nos. 13 to 15 are found in Section 182)
20.16. An offence committed in the course of a journey or voyage may be inquired into or
tried by a court through or into whose local jurisdiction that person or thing passed in the
course of that journey or voyage. (Section 183).
20.17. Cases falling under Section 219 (three offences of the same kind committed within a
space of twelve months whether in respect of the same person or not) , cases falling under
Section 220 (commission of more offences than one, in one series of acts committed together
as to form the same transaction) and cases falling under Section 221, ( where it is doubtful
what offences have been committed), may be inquired into or tried by any court competent
to inquire into or try any of the offences. (Section 184).
21. Apart from Sections 177 to 184, which lay down in elaborate detail, the rules relating to
jurisdiction, Chapter XIII of the Code also contains a few other sections. Section 185
empowers the State Government to order any case or class of cases committed for trial in
any district, to be tried in any Sessions Division. Section 186 empowers the High Court, in
case where two or more courts have taken cognizance of the same offence and a question
as to which of them should inquire into or try the offence has arisen, to decide the district
where the inquiry or trial shall take place. Section 187 speaks of the powers of the Magistrate,
in case where a person within his local jurisdiction, has committed an offence outside his
jurisdiction, but the same cannot be inquired into or tried within such jurisdiction. Sections
188 and 189 deal with offences committed outside India.”
34.     It may be seen from the principles culled out from Sections 177 to 184 of the
Cr.P.C that almost all contingencies that are likely to arise have been carefully thought
out and laid down in these provisions.
35.     The only contingency that could not have been provided in the above provisions
of the Cr.P.C, is perhaps where the offence of money-laundering is committed. This
is why Section 44(1) begins with a non-obstante clause. The whole picture is thus
complete with a combined reading of Section 44 of the PMLA and the provisions of
Sections 177 to 184 of the Cr.P.C.
36.     Once this combined scheme is understood, it will be clear that in view of the
specific mandate of clauses (a) and (c) of subsection (1) of Section 44, it is the Special
Court constituted under the PMLA that would have jurisdiction to try even the
scheduled offence. Even if the scheduled offence is taken cognizance of by any other
Court, that Court shall commit the same, on an application by the concerned authority,
to the Special Court which has taken cognizance of the offence of money-laundering.
This answers the first question posed before us.
37.     Coming to the second question arising for our consideration, clause (a) of sub-
section (1) of Section 44 leaves no semblance of any doubt that the offence of money-
laundering is triable only by the Special Court constituted for the area in which the
offence of money-laundering has been committed. To find out the area in which the
offence of money-laundering has been committed, we may have to go back to the
definition in Section 3 of the PMLA.
38.     As we have pointed out earlier, the involvement of a person in any one or more
of certain processes or activities connected with the proceeds of crime, constitutes the
offence of moneylaundering. These processes or activities include, (i) concealment;
(ii) possession; (iii) acquisition; (iv) use; (v) projecting as untainted property; or (vi)
claiming as untainted property.
39.     In other words, a person may (i) acquire proceeds of crime in one place, (ii)
keep the same in his possession in another place, (iii) conceal the same in a third
place, and (iv) use the same in a fourth place. The area in which each one of these
places is located, will be the area in which the offence of moneylaundering has been
committed. To put it differently, the area in which the place of acquisition of the
proceeds of crime is located or the place of keeping it in possession is located or the
place in which it is concealed is located or the place in which it is used is located, will
be the area in which the offence has been committed.
40.     In addition, the definition of the words “proceeds of crime” focuses on “deriving
or obtaining a property” as a result of criminal activity relating to a scheduled offence.
Therefore, the area in which the property is derived or obtained or even held or
concealed, will be the area in which the offence of moneylaundering is committed.
41.     Having seen the legal landscape on the question of jurisdiction, let us now come
back to the facts of the case on hand. It is the case of the petitioner that what was
attached by the Enforcement Directorate under Section 5 of the Act as proceeds of
crime, was the bank account of the petitioner in Navi Mumbai, Maharashtra and that
therefore the offence of moneylaundering, even according to the respondent has been
committed in Maharashtra.
42.     But the said contention overlooks the six different types of processes or
activities mentioned in Explanation (i) under Section 3 of the Act, as connected with
proceeds of crime, namely, concealment, possession, acquisition, or use, etc.
43.     Even according to the petitioner, she ran three campaigns from April 2020 to
September 2021 in an online crowdfunding platform named “Ketto”. From the
pleadings on record, we are not able to make out (i) the number of persons who
provided funds; and (ii) the places where the donors were located.
44.     The bank account of the petitioner in HDFC Bank, Koperkhairane Branch, Navi
Mumbai, Maharashtra, is the ultimate destination, to which all funds reached.
Therefore, Navi Mumbai, Maharashtra is the place where the proceeds of crime were
taken possession of (if they were actually proceeds of crime). Therefore, Navi
Mumbai, Maharashtra is a place where only one of the six different processes or
activities listed in Section 3 has been carried out. The other activity namely acquisition
of the proceeds of crime (if they really are) has taken place in the virtual mode with
people from different parts of the country/world transferring money online. If
acquisition has taken place in the real physical world, the difficulty with respect to the
question of jurisdiction would have been lesser. Since acquisition has taken place in
the virtual world, the places from where online transfers of money took place, are
known only to the petitioner or perhaps their Bankers.
45.     Therefore, the question of territorial jurisdiction in this case requires an enquiry
into a question of fact as to the place where the alleged proceeds of crime were (i)
concealed; or (ii) possessed; or (iii) acquired; or (iv) used. This question of fact will
actually depend upon the evidence that unfolds before the Trial Court. It will be useful
in this regard to extract Paragraph 38 of the decision in Kaushik Chatterjee which
“38. But be that as it may, the upshot of the above discussion is:
38.1. That the issue of jurisdiction of a court to try an “offence” or “offender” as well as the
issue of territorial jurisdiction, depend upon facts established through evidence.
38.2. That if the issue is one of territorial jurisdiction, the same has to be decided with
respect to the various rules enunciated in Sections 177 to 184 of the Code.
38.3. That these questions may have to be raised before the court trying the offence and
such court is bound to consider the same.”
46.     Therefore, we are of the view that the issue of territorial jurisdiction cannot be
decided in a writ petition, especially when there is a serious factual dispute about the
place/places of commission of the offence. Hence, this question should be raised by
the petitioner before the Special Court, since an answer to the same would depend
upon evidence as to the places where any one or more of the processes or activities
mentioned in Section 3 were carried out. Therefore, giving liberty to the petitioner to
raise the issue of territorial jurisdiction before the Trial Court, this writ petition is
dismissed. There will be no order as to costs.
