dated 03.09.2020, which has been issued with regard to
the impounding of his passport.
3.     Learned Senior Advocate Mr.Maulin Raval appearing
for the petitioner has submitted that in fact the entire
exercise        undertaken    by      the      respondent          passport
authorities with regard to the impounding his passport is
misconceived as no criminal offence has been registered
against the petitioner.
3.1. Learned Senior Advocate, upon instructions, further
submitted that as on today the petitioner is not in
receipt of any summons issued by any authority with
regard to the criminal offence.
3.2. Learned Senior Advocate has further submitted that
since the respondent authority is directed to surrender
his passport, the petitioner had approached this Court by
filing   a     writ  petition being        Special  Civil     Application
No.9803 of 2018. He has submitted that by order dated
19.07.2019, the said writ petition was disposed of with a
direction to the petitioner to make a fresh application for
return of his passport before the concerned authorities
and the respondent-authorities were directed to decide
the same in accordance with law.
3.3. Learned Senior Advocate Mr. Raval has submitted
that pursuant to the aforesaid directions issued by this
Court,       the     petitioner   made       an    application           dated
14.08.2019 and pursuant             to the said application, the
petitioner       was asked to fill up an undertaking                       vide
communication          dated    04.11.2019,       in   view         of       the
Notification          No.GSR       570(E)        dated        25.08.1993,
3.4. Learned Senior Advocate has pointed out para No.2
of the undertaking, which mentions for providing the
details with regard to the criminal case.              It is submitted
by him that the petitioner has specifically declared that
there is no criminal case pending against him in any
Court     of     law.  However,     despite    such   declaration            the
passport has not been released.              Finally, it is submitted
that    by      the   impugned     order     dated    03.09.2020,            the
petitioner informed that his passport has been impounded
by invoking the provisions of Section 10(3)(h) of the
3.5. Learned Senior Advocate has submitted that in fact,
the    said      provisions      will   not     apply   in    case        of     the
petitioner and in absence of any such material, the
passport       of    the    petitioner    cannot     be   impounded             and
hence, it is urged that the impugned orders may be set
4.     In response to the aforesaid submissions, learned
advocate Mr. Amin appearing for the respondent, while
placing reliance on the affidavit filed by the petitioner,
has submitted that in view of the specific information
received by the passport authorities that the petitioner is
engaged in some anti-national activities, the Passport
Officer      vide       communications          dated     03.12.2020            had
requested the Superintendent                    of Police, Kachchh and
Superintendent            of Police, Special Branch CID Jaipur,
Rajasthan to provide specific material with regard to
involvement          of    the    petitioner      in   any      anti-national
activities.       He has submitted that no material showing
the     involvement          of   the     petitioner     in     anti-national
activities       has     been    received.      Though,     prior         to     the
issuance of the aforesaid communications, the Passport
Officer, Ahmedabad was informed that the petitioner is
engaged in some anti-national activities.
4.1. Thus, it is submitted that in view of the aforesaid
communications, which were received in the year 2016
from the Police Superintendent, Rajsthan, Jaipur, the
passport of the petitioner has been impounded.
5.     I have heard the learned advocates appearing for
the respective parties. The genesis of the impounding of
the passport of the petitioner lies in the alleged so
called anti-national activities committed by the petitioner.
In order to verify such alleged anti-national activities
committed          by   the  petitioner,    the  Passport          Officer,
Ahmedabad            vide   communication       dated       03.12.2020
addressed to the Superintendent of Police, Kachchh and
Superintendent of Police of Rajasthan had requested to
supply information in this regard. It              was              further
informed that thorough verification should be done in
this matter and the concerned Officer shall be informed,
if any adverse material is found against the petitioner
since the writ petition is filed before this Court. It is an
admitted fact that no materials remotely suggesting the
involvement          of   the   petitioner          in   any      anti-national
activities has been produced before this Court.                                   The
concerned        Officers,   from     whom         such    clarification          was
sought, have also not supplied any relevant information
to the respondent-passport authorities.
7.     There is no material produced by the respondent to
indicate that any criminal offence has been registered
against the petitioner.          In absence of such materials, the
respondents          cannot    impound            the    passport          of      the
petitioner        by    a   mechanical          order    by     invoking           the
provisions of Section 10 (3) (h) of the Passports Act,
1967. It is pertinent to note that initially the case of the
passport authority was that the petitioner is involved in
some      criminal       offences,    however          subsequently,           it     is
alleged that         he is indulged in anti-national activities.
8.     The impugned order dated 03.09.2020 refers to the
provisions of Section 10 (3) (h) of the Passports Act,
1967.     Since      no   material      has      been     produced         by      the
respondent         authorities     that       the    petitioner      has         been
involved       in    any    criminal       offence      despite      a      specific
statement        made     by   him     in      the    writ-petition        in     this
regard, the invocation of the aforesaid provision by the
impugned order dated 03.09.2020 is mis-conceived and
misdirected. Hence, the impugned orders require to be
quashed and set aside. It is interesting to note that the
passport of the petitioner is not impounded by invoking
the provisions of Section 10(3)(c) of                 the Passports Act,
1967, which refers to the impounding of passport, if
holder of the passport is involved in any activities, which
is against the interest          of sovereignty, integrity and the
security      of     India  but  under         Section    10(3)(h)        of     the
Passports        Act,    1967,  which       refers    to   registration            of
criminal offence.
9.     In view of the aforesaid analysis and observations,
the impugned orders are required to be quashed and set
aside.     The       respondents    are       directed    to    release          the
passport of the petitioner bearing No. N5339065 within a
period       of one month, after receipt of the copy of the
writ of this Court.         Rule is made absolute.
