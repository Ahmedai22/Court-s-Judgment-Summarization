Present:    Mr. S.S.Dinarpur, Advocate for the petitioner.
Puran Chand Sharma has filed this petition under Section
482 Cr.P.C to challenge the order dated 13.01.2021 (Annexure P-8),
whereby Chief Judicial Magistrate, Yamuna Nagar in violation of the
order dated 06.11.2020 (Annexure P-7) passed by this Court, refused to
refund the amount of Rs.1,10,000/-, deposited by him in compliance of
the anticipatory bail order dated 25.02.2014 (Annexure P-2) relating to
case FIR No.428 dated 16.09.2012 (Annexure P-1) under Sections 148,
149, 323, 427, 447, 452, 506 and 380 Indian Penal Code, registered at
Learned counsel for the petitioner has argued that upon
implication of petitioner in case FIR No.428 dated 16.09.2012
(Annexure P-1), he apprehended arrest and approached this Court
through CRM-M-5049-2014 under Section 438 Cr.P.C to seek pre
arrest bail, wherein this Court on 25.02.2014 extended him interim
concession and the said order reads as under:-
“Learned counsel for the petitioner contends
that as per the allegations in the FIR, one person is
stated to be armed with sword and given injury on
the shoulders of the complainant but there is no
injury on the person of the complainant with sword.
He also argued that this is a false case. Civil
litigation is pending between the parties and the
petitioner is even ready to deposit Rs.1,10,000/-
which the learned Additional Advocate General,
Haryana states to have been found stolen but had not
mentioned in the FIR.
Petitioner is directed to deposit the above said
amount within seven days before the Trial Court and
will not claim the said amount till the final disposal
of the case.
Meanwhile, in the event of arrest, the petitioner
be released on interim bail subject to his furnishing
personal bonds and surety to the satisfaction of
Arresting/Investigating Officer. However, the
petitioner shall join the investigation on 04.03.2014
at 10.00 a.m. and shall abide by the conditions as
provided under Section 438 (2) Cr.P.C.
Adjourned to 07.04.2014.”
According to Mr. Dinarpur, learned counsel the
petitioner deposited the requisite amount on 03.03.2014 and complied
with the order dated 25.02.2014, therefore, the interim bail order was
finally confirmed by this Court on 07.04.2014 (Annexure P-3).
Learned counsel has drawn the attention of the Court to the order dated
25.02.2020 (Annexure P-6) and submitted that the trial in the subject
FIR ended in acquittal of all the accused including the petitioner,
therefore, he moved an application bearing No.CRM-26961-2020 in
CRM-M-5049-2014 for issuance of directions to Chief Judicial
Magistrate, Yamuna Nagar for release of the amount of Rs.1,10,000/-,
and    the  same     was   accepted      vide   order     dated 06.11.2020
(Annexure P-7), as the state counsel did not oppose the claim of the
Learned counsel has argued that despite the direction
passed by this Court, Chief Judicial Magistrate, Yamuna Nagar
proceeded to decline the prayer through impugned order dated
13.01.2021 and dismissed his application for release of the amount. He
submits that once the trial of the case is over, the condition imposed at
the time of granting the bail to the accused cannot be made binding
upon him, merely because the complainant has preferred an appeal,
wherein admittedly even no notice has been served. He has argued that
the impugned order has been passed by the Chief Judicial Magistrate,
Yamuna Nagar in blatant violation of the order dated 06.11.2020
passed by this Court, therefore, petition be allowed and Chief Judicial
Magistrate, Yamuna Nagar be directed to release the amount.
On 17.02.2021, while noticing the background of this case,
notice of motion was issued to the respondent-State and at the same
time, explanation from Mr. Arvind Kumar, Chief Judicial Magistrate,
Yamuna Nagar at Jagadhari was also called for as the impugned order
was passed in flagrant violation of clear and unambiguous direction
issued by this Court on 06.11.2020. In response, the officer sent his
explanation through communication dated 22.02.2021.
The State has also filed short reply by way of affidavit of
Subhash Chand, HPS, Deputy Superintendent of Police, Yamuna
Learned State counsel has pointed out that though the
direction given by this Court on 06.11.2020 is specific, but the trial
Court has proceeded to decline the petitioner's request by considering
the fact that the complainant has challenged the judgment of acquittal
by filing an appeal, and also noticed that in appeal the accused persons
have not been served. However, it is conceded by the learned State
counsel that the condition imposed by this Court while releasing the
petitioner on pre arrest bail, would come to an end on acquittal of the
accused as their bail bonds and surety bonds stood discharged on
Learned counsel for the parties have been heard and with
their assistance, the case file has been perused carefully.
The record of the case reveals that on 25.02.2014 the
concession of interim pre arrest bail was extended to the petitioner with
a condition to deposit an amount of Rs.1,10,000/-, who was also
prohibited to claim the same till the case is finally decided.
Concededly, till the conclusion of trial, the petitioner never claimed
refund of the amount and after his acquittal, the accused was very
much within his rights to claim refund, which was not opposed by state
counsel at all. Thus, the direction issued by this Court on 06.11.2020 is
crystal clear and did not require any interpretation, much less by the
A perusal of the impugned order further shows that the
Chief Judicial Magistrate, Yamuna Nagar needlessly proceeded to
interpret the order dated 06.11.2020 without any jurisdiction, and
further observed that filing of appeal against the judgment of acquittal
by complainant was not brought to the notice of this Court, therefore,
the amount should not be disbursed to the applicant/accused till further
clarification from the High Court. This reasoning is patently absurd and
illogical as the order of deposit of amount passed on 25.02.2014 was
considered by this Court while issuing the directions on 06.11.2020 for
refund of the amount. Besides, the order passed in bail application and
the condition imposed therein could not have been stretched beyond
the conclusion of trial, therefore, the impugned order dated 13.01.2021
is not sustainable.
Apart from this, the explanation dated 22.02.2021 sent by
Mr. Arvind Kumar, Chief Judicial Magistrate, Yamuna Nagar shows
that the officer felt honour in receiving the show cause notice for
violation of the order passed by the High Court and attempted to
explain that he mistakenly refused to refund the amount as directed by
this Court, and regretted inconvenience caused to this Court, as if, the
officer failed to comply with the order of this Court on administrative
side, e.g.- failure to send requisitioned record of a case, in time. The
expression and reasoning contained in the impugned order do not show
that the disobedience of the direction by this Court was erroneous as
claimed in the explanation, therefore, the same is not worth acceptance.
Thus, in view of the above discussion this Court has no
hesitation in holding that Chief Judicial Magistrate, Yamuna Nagar has
passed the impugned order by giving irrational reasons, which not only
show his dearth of understanding criminal jurisprudence &
fundamental principles of law, but also reflect judicial indiscipline on
his part, which amounts to grave misconduct and warrants
departmental action against him.
Resultantly, the petition is allowed and the impugned order
dated 13.01.2021 (Annexure P-8) is set aside. It is directed that the
amount deposited by the petitioner pursuant to the order dated
25.02.2014 be refunded to him forthwith.
Let a copy of this order be sent to Hon'ble the Chief Justice
for initiating departmental action against Mr. Arvind Kumar, Chief
Judicial Magistrate, Yamuna Nagar at Jagadhari.
