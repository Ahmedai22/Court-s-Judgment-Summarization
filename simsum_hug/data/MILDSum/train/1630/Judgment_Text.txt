This is yet another case of a hapless Muslim divorced
wife battling for two decades for executing a maintenance
decree; this again reminds of what the Privy Council lamented
more than a century & a half ago about the difficulty a decree
holder faces in the execution proceedings in THE GENERAL
(1871-72), VOL.14, PAGE 605, it is worth mentioning:
“These proceedings certainly illustrate what was
said by Mr.Doyne, and what has been often stated
before, that the difficulties of a litigant in India
begin when he has obtained a Decree…”
The Apex Court in its recent decision affirming the judgment
of this court has expressed its concern & aguish against
protraction of execution proceedings and advised all the
courts of the country to ensure their expeditious disposal vide
2.   The brief facts that led to the ex-husband filing of
(i)    Parties are Sunni Muslims; they had contracted
marriage in March 1991; mehr was fixed at Rs.5,000/-;
walima was organized at Madikeri; this marriage was short
lived; wife complained about dowry harassment, etc; she left
for native seeking shelter; the ink of nikahnama had not dried
yet and the petitioner uttered talaq on 25.11.1991; he paid to
the ex-wife     the mehr money; he added another sum of
Rs.900/- for her maintenance during the iddat i.e., ordinarily
for three months post divorce.
(ii)   The un-remarried ex-wife had filed a Civil Suit for
maintenance on 24.08.2002; long thereafter it came to be
registered as     O.S.No.119/2005; the ex-husband filed his
Written Statement resisting the suit on several grounds; he
has uttered talaq; he contracted another marriage; he has
begotten a child too; wife had filed dowry harassment case in
he was acquitted in the dowry harassment case; ex-wife
should     invoke   the  provisions   of  the    Muslim Women
(Protection    of  Rights  on    Divorce)   Act,  1986;  in  no
circumstance, he would pay anything.
(iii)    The issues having been framed, the recording of
evidence began only on 27.10.2010 ie., 8 years after the
institution of suit; the learned I Addl. Principal Judge, Family
Court at Bengaluru handed the judgment & decree after nine
years, i.e., on 12.08.2011; justice delayed is justice buried,
being only a meaningless text book mantra; the operative
portion of the judgment reads as under:
“The suit in O.S.119/2005 is decreed in part.
The plaintiff is entitled to monthly maintenance at
the rate of Rs.3000/- from the date of the suit till
the death of the plaintiff or till she gets remarried or
till the death of the defendant.”
(iv)   The ex-wife had put decree in enforcement by filing
Execution No.155/2011 on 11.11.2011 inter alia by way of
arrest & detention of the ex-husband; that was stoutly
resisted; he again pleaded lack of means to pay the decreetal
amount and decree being a nullity; the court below did not
agree; it had sent him to civil prison on 14.12.2012; however,
he was released on 15.01.2013 on paying Rs.30,000/-. The
ex-husband had filed another application in I.A.No.10 under
Order XXI Rule 37 of C.P.C., 1908 seeking determination of
his financial incapacity;     the said I.A. having been rejected
vide order dated 22.11.2014, the ex-husband has knocked at
the doors of writ court.
3.    I have heard the learned counsel for the parties and
perused the petition papers; I regret to state that the
assistance from the Bar was frugal; however, that would not
relieve the Court of its duty to adjudge the cause; the
following three questions of seminal importance arise for
(i)     whether a Muslim is duty bound to make provision
for his ex-wife beyond iddat despite paying paltry Mehr if she
remains un-remarried and is incapable of maintaining herself ?
(ii)    whether a decree for maintenance like any other
money decree can be resisted on the ground of lack of financial
(iii)   whether a Muslim contracting another marriage
and begetting children from it can resist execution of the
maintenance decree obtained by his ex-wife, on that ground
My answer to the questions no. (i) is in the affirmative
and to the question nos. (ii) and (iii) is in the negative,
(I)   As   to   Muslim     divorced   wife's    right  to
maintenance beyond iddat and its quantification being
(a)   Parties being Muslims by religion are essentially
governed by Mohammedan law; they had contracted marriage
on 16.3.1991 mehr was fixed at Rs. 5000/-; the walima was
organized on 17.3.1991; it was not a long & happy marriage;
it ended in talaq on 25.11.1991; wife had filed criminal cases
for dowry harassment & cruelty; they culminated in acquittal;
husband does not say that it was a "honourable acquittal";
hurriedly espoused another woman and begot a child too,
post haste; the ex-wife not being able to maintain herself,
obtained a maintenance decree but nine precious years of her
life were paid as cost; it shakes anyone's conscience; in fact,
husband's contention in the suit as to lack of financial
capacity and jurisdiction too was rejected by the trial Judge.
(b)    The ex-wife sought to enforce the decree; the ex-
husband was eventually committed to civil prison for a
month; he paid Rs.30,000/- and therefore, was enlarged;
however, the decreetal sum being much more, remained
unpaid; she endeavors to execute the decree for the
remainder; twenty years have passed eluding her the fruits of
the successful legal battle, at least on paper. Husband's
application in I.A.No.10 wherein he had re-agitated inter alia
the issue of financial incapacity as a ground for not obeying
the decree came to be rejected; that happens to be the subject
matter     of  challenge  here;  his   contentions   are  treated
(II) "In Islam, marriage is a civil contract", has shades
(a)    Ex-husband's contention that amongst Muslims,
marriage is only a civil contract, cannot be disputed;
Mahmood, J in the famous case of ABDUL KADIR VS.
"…marriage among Muhammadans is not a
sacrament, but purely a civil contract; and though it
is solemnised generally with recitation of certain
verses from the Kuran, yet the Muhammadan law
does not positively prescribe any service peculiar to
the occasion.”
"Marriage is a contract" has many shades of meaning; it is not
a sacrament unlike a Hindu marriage, is true; whatever be
the epistemology, marriage crowns the parties with status like
husband, wife, in-laws, etc; if children are born, they earn the
promotional status of father & mother, and of grand-parents
too, if the lineage continues; when marriage is dissolved, only
the spousal tie is torn and the status comes to an end;
however, the blood of divorced spouses flows in the veins of
their children and grandsire; added, demise of a spouse
renders the other a widow/widower; succession to estate may
also open.
(b)   All the above shows the kinds of relationship that
the marriage as a social institution brings in, regardless of
religion which the parties belong to and the contractual
elements; to put it succinctly, marriage amongst Muslims
begins with the contract and graduates to the status as it
ordinarily does in any other community; this very status gives
rise to certain justiciable obligations; they are ex contractu; a
muslim marriage is not a sacrament, does not repel certain
rights & obligations arising from its dissolution; such a
marriage dissolved by divorce, per se does not annihilate all
the duties & obligations of parties by lock, stock & barrel; in
law, new obligations too may arise, one of them being the
circumstantial duty of a person to provide sustenance to his
ex-wife who is destituted by divorce.
(III) Scriptural injunction to Muslims for providing
life essentials to their indigent ex-wives:
The view that a pious muslim owes a moral/religious
duty to provide subsistence to his destitute ex-wife gains
support from the following verses of The Holy Quran:
“When you divorce women, and they (are
about to) fulfill the term of their (iddat), either take
them back on equitable terms or set them free on
equitable terms, but do not take back to injure them
(or) to take undue advantage, if anyone does that,
he wrongs his soul...” (Surah Al Bakhra Aiyat
“There is no sin on you, if you divorce women
while you have not touched (had sexual relation
with) them nor appointed them unto their Mehr, but
bestowed on them (as suitable gift) the rich
according to his means and the poor according to
his means, a gift reasonable amount is a duty on
the doers of good” (Surah Al Bakhra Aiyat No.236).
There is also sufficient intrinsic material in the Holy Quran &
Hadith,    which    lays   foundation    to   the   accrual    of a
corresponding right in favour a divorced wife for maintenance;
generally it is conditioned by three cumulative factors viz (i)
mehr amount is insignificant; (ii) she is incapable of paddling
her life boat on her own; & (iii) she has remained un-
(IV)  The    right   of  indigent     Muslim   wife   for
maintenance is not confined to iddat nor limited to mehr
(a)   A Muslim ex-wife has a right to maintenance
subject to satisfying certain conditions, is indisputable; in
Islamic jurisprudence, as a general norm, Mehr i.e., dower is
treated as consideration for marriage; it may be a ‘prompt
dower’ payable before the wife is called upon to enter the
conjugal domicile or it may be a ‘deferred dower’ payable on
the dissolution of marriage vide HAMIRA BIBI VS. ZUBAIDA
BIBI (1916) 43 IA 294; ordinarily, the right of an ex-wife to
maintenance does not extend beyond iddat; I should hasten
to add that Islamic jurisprudence has not treated this as a
Thumb Rule ever, although there is some juristic opinion in
variance; this norm has to be subject to the rider that the
amount paid to the ex-wife, be it in the form of mehr or be it a
sum quantified on the basis of mehr, or otherwise, is not an
inadequate or illusory sum; it is a matter of common
knowledge    that   more  often    than   not,   mehr  is  fixed
inadequately, bride-side lacking equal bargaining power inter
alia because of economic & gender-related factors; this is not
to say that the inadequacy of mehr would affect the validity of
nikah, that being altogether a different matter.
(b)   For how long the right to maintenance enures to a
divorced muslim wife, largely is no longer res integra; subject
to all just exceptions, the duty of a muslim to provide
sustenance    to   his  ex-wife    is  co-extensive   with   her
requirement, the yardstick being the life essentials and not
the luxury; the Hon'ble Supreme Court in DANIAL LATIFI
Vs. UOI, AIR 2001 SC 3958, having construed the provisions
of 1986 Act supra has observed that a muslim is duty bound
to make a reasonable & fair provision for the future of his
divorced wife, and this duty, as of necessity, extends for a
period beyond iddat; the Allahabad High Court in a recent
case between JUBAIR AHMED vs. ISHRAT BANO, (2019)
“…it is to be noticed that the right of
maintenance available to wife from husband is
absolute right and even divorce cannot affect this
right unless the wife is disqualified on account of
remarriage or her sufficient earning…”
(c)    Frugality   of  deferred    dower   &   right    to
The payment of frugal mehr money per se cannot be a
defence availing to an able bodied man for denying the claim
or defying the decree, for maintenance; if an illusory
compensation for the public acquisition of private property is
'no compensation' vide KESAVANANDA (AIR 1973 SC 1461),
the reason & justice tell us that an illusory mehr cannot be
the basis for the quantification of the amount of maintenance
nor for limiting its duration to iddat; the analogy of "illusory
compensation" is logically invocable since the payment of
amount by the husband as mehr on talaq, by its very nature
has compensatory elements; 'de minimis non curat lex': law
does not take cognizance of the insignificant [COWARD VS.
BADLEY (1859) 4 H&N 478]; after all, an illusion is a myth of
reality; illusory things cannot constitute the "building blocks
of jural relations", more particularly the immunity from duty
arising from law, religion & morals.
(d)   Divorce brings a trainload of difficulties to the
women, is obvious; divorced women in general and divorced
Muslim women in particular undergo a lot of hardship; the
tears they shed are hidden in their veils; it is not that the
unscrupulous men do not know all this; an American poet
Maya Angelou (1928-2014) tellingly portrays this in a famous
poem "Equality", a stanza wherein reads as under:
"Take the blinders from your vision,
The contentions that the duty to furnish essentials to the ex-
wife is coterminous with iddat period post talaq and that the
quantum of maintenance amount cannot exceed the size of
mehr money, are difficult to sustain in ‘Law in a Changing
Society’; in the contemporary costly society wherein blood is
cheaper than bread, the tokenistic amount of Rs.5,000/- paid
by the husband to the ex-wife as mehr or its quantification on
the basis of mehr, is militantly unjust and illusory; the
petitioner has paid another paltry sum of Rs.900/- to the
respondent ex-wife as maintenance during iddat i.e., for a
period of about three months, only celebrates the inadequacy
& illusoriness; this amount will not be sufficient to buy a cup
of popcorn a day from the street carter too.
(e)   In matters of this kind, courts need to have Lord
Denning's Teleological Approach (BUCHANAN vs. BABCO,
1977(2) WLR 107) to the interpretation of personal law, even if
it bears religious overtones; or else, it ceases to be living law
of the people and fails to serve its avowed purpose; an
argument to the contrary would perpetuate hegemonic
masculinity over the women that are disadvantaged by the
unscrupulous acts of men; added, that strikes at the root of
'justice as fairness.' or the very "idea of justice"; the approach
of courts should be consistent with the progression of law
achieved precedent by precedent through judicial activism,
despite some clergical resistance thereto; this branch of
Muslim personal law has marched from April to May in SHAH
BANO (1985) 2 SCC 556 and now finds June of its life in
SHAYARA BANO (2017) 9 SCC 1; any adjudication of
maintenance disputes without reference to this progression of
law runs the risk of being tainted as an unfair treatment of
the subject matter.
(V)   Constitution and International Conventions on
(a)   The   UN     General     Assembly     adopted     a
comprehensive Treaty on Womens’ Human Rights on
18.12.1979, namely, “The United Nations Convention on the
Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women”
(CEDAW); the object of this Convention is to abolish the de
facto and de jure discrimination and inequality that are
gender specific; out of 189 countries, India too happens to be
a signatory to this; despite a large number of ratifications,
there are grave indications that discrimination against women
persists and pernicious acts to restrict their rights &
freedoms in all aspects of their lives do continue; it cannot be
denied that the contours of the principle of equality & dignity
and    non-discrimination   enshrined    in  the  constitutions,
legislative instruments and Human Rights Treaty regimes in
the globe only present a fractured reality and a fragile
framework for the Human Rights of women; discrimination
based on gender stereotype, stigma, harmful & patriarchal
cultural norms, and gender based violence which particularly
affect women, have an adverse impact on their ability to gain
access to justice on an equal basis qua men.
(b)   The right to equality & dignity and the right not to
be discriminated, represent twin pillars of the edifice of
Human Rights Jurisprudence; Goal 5 of UNITED NATIONS
SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS, (2015) swears:
"...Ending all discrimination against women
and girls is not only a basic human right, it's crucial
for sustainable future; it's proven that empowering
women and girls, helps economic growth and
It hardly needs to be stated that as a constitutional
imperative    [Article  51(c)], the   International    Treaties &
Conventions animate our domestic law, be it legislation,
precedent, custom or contract vide VISHAKA Vs. STATE OF
RAJASTHAN, (1997) 6 SCC 241; the human values that
animate our constitutional regime coupled with several
International Treaties/Conventions aimed at protecting life,
liberty & dignity of women, give rise to 'title facts' from which
the right to maintenance meaningful to the hapless women in
general and divorced women in particular.
(c)    'Dignity is of unconditional and incomparable worth
that admits of no equivalent' said Immanuel Kant (1724-
1804); destitution diminishes the dignity and worth of an
individual; "dignity of the individual" as a universal "human
value"    finds  an    exalted  place  in   several International
Conventions and Treaties, few of which are referred to above;
as an inalienable human value, it has a preambular
placement in our Constitution; it also figures at the sub-
constitutional level i.e., in Parliamentary statutes like 1986
Act, supra; it lurks in Shah Bano, in Shayara Bano and in
their genre; human dignity as a framework right of
constitutional recognition harbors a bundle of rights which
supports the right of divorced women for sustenance; this
age-old right in Islam is called nafaqah; it means all those
things such as food, clothes, shelter, etc. which are necessary
to support life ("The Hedaya" by Charles Hamilton, 1957 Edn);
in a sense this right is a 'daughter-right of human dignity', to
borrow the terminology of a great Israeli Judge of yester
(VI)  Apex     Court,    social  context     approach   and
GODSE, AIR 2014 SC 689, it is observed:
“18. …Courts have to adopt different approaches in
“social justice adjudication”, which is also known
as “social context adjudication” as mere
“adversarial approach” may not be very
appropriate. There are number of social justice
legislations giving special protection and benefits to
vulnerable groups in the society. Prof. Madhava
Menon describes it eloquently: 'social context
judging” is essentially the application of equality
jurisprudence as evolved by Parliament and the
Supreme Court in myriad situations presented
before courts where unequal parties are pitted in
adversarial proceedings and where courts are
called upon to dispense equal justice. Apart from
the socio-economic inequalities accentuating the
disabilities of the poor in an unequal fight, the
adversarial process itself operates to the
disadvantage of the weaker party. In such a
situation, the judge has to be not only sensitive to
the inequalities of parties involved but also
positively inclined to the weaker party...'
19. Provision of maintenance would definitely fall
in this category which aims at empowering the
destitute and achieving social justice or equality
and dignity of the individual. While dealing with
cases under this provision, drift in the approach
from “adversarial” litigation to social context
adjudication is the need of the hour.”
(b)   DANIAL      LATIFI    supra    was    rendered  by  a
Constitution Bench of the Apex Court two decades ago; what
is stated at Paragraph No.5 of this decision, is profitable to
“…Our society is male dominated both economically
and socially and women are assigned, invariably, a
dependant role, irrespective of the class of society
to which she belongs. A woman on her marriage
very often, though highly educated, gives up her all
other avocations and entirely devotes herself to the
welfare of the family, in particular she shares with
her husband, her emotions, sentiments, mind and
body, and her investment in the marriage is her
entire life a sacramental sacrifice of her individual
self and is far too enormous to be measured in
terms of money. When a relationship of this nature
breaks up, in what manner we could compensate
her so far as emotional fracture or loss of
investment is concerned, there can be no answer. It
is a small solace to say that such a woman should
be compensated in terms of money towards her
livelihood and such a relief which partakes basic
human rights to secure gender and social justice is
universally recognised by persons belonging to all
religions and it is difficult to perceive that Muslim
law intends to provide a different kind of
responsibility by passing on the same to those
unconnected with the matrimonial life such as the
heirs who were likely to inherit the property from
her or the wakf boards. Such an approach appears
to us to be a kind of distortion of the social facts.
Solutions to such societal problems of universal
magnitude pertaining to horizons of basic human
rights, culture, dignity and decency of life and
dictates of necessity in the pursuit of social justice
should be invariably left to be decided on
considerations other than religion or religious faith
or beliefs or national, sectarian, racial or communal
constraints. ...”
(c)    In the recent case i.e., RANA NAHID @ RESHMA
VS. SHAHIDUL HAQ CHISTI in Crl.A.No.192/2011 decided
on 18.06.2020, the court observed as under:
“29. The right to equality, irrespective of religion,
is a basic human right, recognized, reaffirmed and
reiterated in the Universal Declaration of Human
Rights adopted by the United Nations on
December 10, 1948. Article 2 of the declaration
“Article 2 : Everyone is entitled to all the rights
and freedoms set forth in the declaration,
without distinction of any kind, such as race,
colour, sex, language, religion, political or other
opinion, national or social origin, property, birth
or other status.”
30. The International Covenant for Civil and
Political Rights (ICCPR) obligates the state parties to
ensure equal right of women to enjoyment of all
rights mentioned in each of the covenants. This
right is irrespective of religion…”.
31. The Convention on the Elimination of All Forms
of Discrimination against Women 1979, commonly
referred to as CEDAW, recognizes amongst others,
the right of women to equality irrespective of
religion, as a basic human right. Article 2 of
CEDAW exhorts State Parties to ensure adoption of
a woman friendly legal system and woman friendly
policies and practices.
32. As a signatory to the CEDAW, India is
committed to adopt a woman friendly legal system
and woman friendly policies and practices. The
1986 Act for Muslim Women, being a post CEDAW
law, this Court is duty bound to interpret the
provisions of the said Act substantively, liberally,
and purposefully, in such a manner as would
benefit women of the Muslim community.
33. Under the Indian Constitution, the right to
equality is a fundamental right. All persons are
equal before the law and are entitled to equal
protection of the laws, be it substantive law or
34. The competing and conflicting principles of
religious freedom of citizens and gender equality for
women, has posed a major challenge to the
judiciary in India...”
(d)    The NAVTEJ SINGH JOHAR'S case, (2018) 10
SCC 1 has recognized the Doctrine of non-retrogression of
rights; in our realm, several human rights have been
progressively realized over the years through the process of
socio-economic development accelerated by legislative and
judicial process; in the light of Article 38 of the Constitution,
the judicial, quasi-judicial and administrative functions of the
State aimed at furthering social welfare has to be consistent
with the concerns which this new doctrine voices; a survey of
law relating to rights of women in general and of divorced
women in particular in all civilized jurisdictions, is marked by
a progressive trend protective of the vulnerable;         in the
backdrop of all this, if the above question (i) is answered in
the   negative,    it  would    only   take   the   "maintenance
jurisprudence" in retrogression imperiling the interest of
divorced Muslim women; a negative answer to the question
virtually amounts to setting the clock back at least by a few
centuries turning a Nelson's Eye to all the progress that the
civilized world has made, hitherto.
(VII) As to ex-husband's plea of pecuniary incapacity
as    a    justification   for  disobeying     the   decree   for
(a)    The counsel for the ex-husband contends that his
client    has    no   financial capacity   and    therefore, the
maintenance decree cannot be enforced against him; in
support of this, he places a huge reliance on JOLLY GEORGE
VERGHESE VS. BANK OF COCHIN, AIR 1980 SC 470; this
contention of the petitioner is difficult to agree with and
reasons for that are not far to seek; firstly, the subject matter
of Jolly George was not the enforcement of maintenance
decree; there, the bank was trying to execute a money decree
that was founded on a debt; secondly, Article 21 of the
Constitution of India was invoked since the bank was
inarticulately treated as an instrumentality of a State; this
becomes clear by the Bench's reference to Maneka Gandhi
(AIR 1978 SC 597) and Sunil Batra [(1978) 4 SCC 409]; the
decree in question is not a money decree, pure & simple and
the decree holder is not a 'money lender'; it is a hapless
divorced   woman      who  has    secured    a  decree   for  her
maintenance after years of struggle; she is relentlessly
battling for its enforcement; it is a distinct case involving the
jural correlatives resting on the shoulders of ex-spouses by
virtue of Talaq.
(b)   It hardly needs to be stated that a decision is an
authority for the proposition which is laid down in a given
fact matrix and not for all that which logically follows from
what has been so laid down: Lord Halsbury in Quinn Vs.
Leathem, (1901) A.C.495; invoking the ratio in Jolly George,
virtually amounts to approximating a maintenance decree
founded on personal law to a money decree structured on
loan contract; thus, the substratum of the one differs from
that of the other, although the procedure and the machinery
adopted for their enforcement are same; therefore, they are
poles asunder; a contra argument amounts to treating the
un-equals as equals and that offends the rule of equality
enshrined    in   Article 14;  this   apart,   the  maintenance
jurisprudence as developed by legislative & judicial process in
this country shows that this right to sustenance is not
founded on contract; courts have repelled the argument of
financial incapacity while awarding maintenance when the
husband     has   an   able   body;  therefore,  the   pecuniary
incapacity of the judgment debtor that ordinarily avails as a
ground for resisting the execution of a money decree does not
come to the rescue of the petitioner.
(VIII) As to ex-husband's plea of contracting another
marriage     and   begetting   child  as a    justification for
disobeying the decree for maintenance:
(a)    The contention of counsel for the petitioner that
his client has contracted another marriage and further,
begotten a child from it, hardly provides a justification for not
obeying the maintenance decree that is secured by his ex-
wife; a Muslim hurriedly contracting another marriage after
pronouncing talaq upon his first wife, cannot be heard to say
that he has to maintain the new spouse and the child
begotten from her as a ground for not discharging the
maintenance      decree;   he   ought   to   have   known     his
responsibility towards the ex-wife who does not have anything
to fall back upon; the said responsibility arose from his own
act of talaq and prior to espousing another woman; the
responsibility & duty owed by a person to his ex-wife are not
destroyed by his contracting another marriage; an argument
to the contrary would amount to placing premium on the
irresponsibility of a husband who divorces the existing wife
and soon espouses another; countenancing the contention of
the kind virtually amounts to permitting a person to take the
advantage of his own wrong; added this contention is
repugnant to law, morality & ethics; if such a contention is
countenanced, that would only encourage talaq which the law
In the above circumstances, this Writ Petition being
devoid of merits, is liable to be dismissed and accordingly, it
is, with a cost of Rs.25,000/-; the learned judge of Court
below is requested to accomplish the execution on a war
footing and report compliance to the Registrar General of this
Court within three months.
