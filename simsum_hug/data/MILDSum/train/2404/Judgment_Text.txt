2    These appeals arise from a judgment of a Division Bench of the High Court of
Madhya Pradesh dated 1 September 2020 in Writ Appeal No 812 of 2020 and a
judgment of a Single Judge dated 20 February 2020 in Writ Petition No 2903 of
2010. The Division Bench has dismissed the Writ Appeal against the judgment
of the Single Judge, setting aside the termination of the respondent and directing
reinstatement with all consequential benefits and back wages from the date of
termination until reinstatement.
3    The respondent was appointed as a casual employee by the Nagar Panchayat,
Kymore, the appellant before this Court, in 1982. The respondent was allotted
the work of issuing ration cards for which he was to collect money and deposit it
with the appellant. After the issuance of a show cause notice, the services of the
respondent were terminated on 4 June 1990.           The respondent instituted a
petition under Article 226 of the Constitution, Writ Petition No 3009 of 1991, to
challenge his termination from service. The petition was dismissed by the High
Court on 6 January 1994. The order dismissing the petition attained finality.
4 On 3 December 2008, a communication was issued by the Regional Deputy
Director Insurance and Local Finance Audit to the Chief Nagar Palika Officer
holding that a cashier had been found responsible and that the amount should
be recovered and be deposited in the Panchayat treasury.          Based on the
communication, the respondent instituted a petition under Article 226 of the
Constitution, being Writ Petition 10285 of 2009, claiming reinstatement in
service.  The petition was disposed of on 6 November 2009 by directing the
appellant to dispose of the representation of the respondent within three
months. On 9 February 2010, the representation was disposed of by a speaking
order and the claim for reinstatement was rejected.
5 A fresh writ petition was then instituted by the respondent, being Writ Petition
(C) No 2903 of 2010, which resulted in the order of the Single Judge dated 20
February 2020. The Single Judge granted reinstatement with full back wages and
consequential benefits. The order of the Single Judge has been upheld in appeal
by the Division Bench by its judgment dated 1 September 2020.
6 Mr Manoj Kumar Sahu, counsel appearing on behalf of the appellant, submits
that the validity of the termination of the services of the respondent attained
finality when the writ petition challenging the termination was dismissed on 6
January 1994. Hence it has been submitted that it was not open to the
respondent to institute a fresh writ petition in 2009, nearly 15 years thereafter
on the basis of the communication dated 3 December 2008 of the Regional
Deputy Director Insurance and Local Finance Audit. In this backdrop, it has been
submitted that the respondent was only a casual employee. The Single Judge, it
has been submitted, erred in directing full back wages with consequential
benefits.
7 On the other hand, Mr Vijay Kumar, senior counsel appearing on behalf of the
respondent, submitted that it was in 2008 when the communication was
addressed by the Regional Deputy Director that it came to light that it was not
the respondent but some other employees who were responsible. Hence, it has
been submitted that the High Court correctly entertained the writ petition
initially in 2009 and thereafter in 2010 since the termination of the respondent
was found to be invalid.
8 The respondent was admittedly a casual employee who had worked from 1982
to 1990. The termination of the services, by an order dated 4 June 1990, was
admittedly the subject matter of a challenge before the High Court in exercise of
its jurisdiction under Article 226 of the Constitution. The petition was dismissed
on 6 January 1994.       The order of termination was upheld and the dispute
attained finality.   On the basis of a communication of the Regional Deputy
Director of 3 December 2008, the respondent instituted a fresh petition in 2009,
which was disposed of on 6 November 2009 by directing the appellant to dispose
of the representation of the respondent within three months. The representation
was rejected by the Chief Nagar Palika Officer. The High Court in the fresh writ
petition instituted by the respondent enquired into the validity of the termination
and ordered reinstatement with back wages. The earlier order of the High Court
dated 6 January 1994, by which the writ petition challenging the termination was
dismissed, continues to operate between the parties. The High Court ought not
to have entertained a second round of proceedings instituted nearly fifteen
years after the challenge to the order of termination attained finality by the
dismissal of the writ petition. That order would operate as res judicata between
the parties. Both the Single Judge and the Division Bench, in appeal, have erred
for the simple reason that once the termination was placed in contest and had
been upheld by the dismissal of the writ petition in 1994, a stale of action could
not have been revived, first, by a direction to dispose of the representation and,
second, in a subsequent writ petition by directing reinstatement with back
wages. The impugned order cannot co-exist with the earlier order upholding the
termination.
9    For the above reasons, the impugned order of the High Court is unsustainable.
We accordingly allow the appeals and set aside the impugned judgment and
order of the High Court dated 1 September 2020 in Writ Appeal No 812 of 2020.
As a consequence of setting aside of the judgment of the Division Bench, the
writ petition filed by the respondent under Article 226, being Writ Petition No
2903 of 2010 shall stand dismissed. In the circumstances of the case, however,
there shall be no order as to costs.
10   Pending application, if any, stands disposed of.
