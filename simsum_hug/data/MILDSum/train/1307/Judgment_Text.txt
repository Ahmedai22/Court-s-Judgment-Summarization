3.           C.R.   No.   36   of  2021   is  registered    at      the
instance of Abhinav Mohanbhai Delkar, who is one of the
Respondent      in   these   Petitions    and  son  of  Mohanbhai
Sanjibhai        Delkar     (hereinafter      referred     to          as
“deceased”).       It  is   stated    in  the  first  information
report (hereinafter referred to as “FIR”) that deceased
was a prominent tribal leader and was representing area
/ constituency, namely, Dadra and Nagar Haveli since
1989 as Member of Parliament. On 21st February, 2021,
deceased      along   with   driver    Ashok  Patel  and    private

bodyguard Nandu Wankhede reached Mumbai for attending
some Court matter. The deceased lodged in Sea Green
deceased committed suicide by hanging in Room No. 512
and this information was intimated to Abhinav Delkar,
son          of   deceased,    through     driver       Ashok      Patel.
Immediately in the evening Respondent - Abhinav Delkar
reached Mumbai and returned back to Silvasa with dead
body of deceased. On 01st March, 2021, Abhinav Delkar
again         reached  Mumbai    and   made   inquiry     with     police
authorities         attached   to   Marine   Drive     Police    Station
about the suicide of his father and it was informed to
him        by   investigating    officer    that    deceased     left          a
suicide         note  as  well    the   minutes     of   Parliamentary
Privilege Committee (hereinafter referred to as “said
committee”). As Abhinav Delkar was to perform certain
religious         rituals  and   as   he  was   not    in  fit     mental
condition, his statement was not recorded on 01st March,
2021. After completing the religious rituals Abhinav
Delkar again reached Mumbai and his statement was then
recorded on 09th March, 2021 and the same is treated as

4.               We may refer to FIR again in detail at later
part of this judgment, at this stage, we may state that
in       the     said    FIR   it    is   stated   that    deceased        was
subjected            to    an     ill-treatment,       harassment          and
defamation at the instance of certain persons. It is
also         stated    in  the   FIR    that  this   ill-treatment         and
harassment was under the orders of Mr. Praful Khoda
Patel,          Administrator,       Dadra   and    Nagar    Haveli.          As
deceased          was   unable    to   bear   this   ill-treatment         and
harassment,            he    committed     suicide.     Thus,     it       was
submitted           in  the   FIR   that   all  these    Petitioners          by
hatching          a   conspiracy created such        an atmosphere            of
pressure and depression which led deceased to end his
life by committing suicide.
5.               Now the persons against whom the grievance is
raised         are     either   Government     Officials     or    private
individuals.            By   following     tabular    chart,    a      ready
reference is made to them and their respective Writ

6.              It is stated in the FIR that fist informant is
residing         at Delkar   House,   Silvasa,  Dadra    and      Nagar
Haveli since his birth along with his family members,
namely,        his  mother  Kalaben.    First informant     is      also
having         sister,   namely,    Divita  whose    marriage         was
solemnized in the year 2017 and she is residing at her
matrimonial home. It is further stated that his father
i.e., deceased was representing Dadra and Nagar Haveli
since 2019 as an independent Member of Parliament and
he belongs to scheduled tribe community (Dhodia Patel).
He was a prominent leader of tribal and devoted his
entire life for up-liftment of social development in
general and up-liftment of the tribal in particular.
Umesh Malani                                               Page 11   of 101
Deceased became Member of Parliament first time in the
year 1989 and since then he was continuously taking
steps for the development of the area and in the year
2019          it   was    his     7th  successful     term    as        the
representative          of   people   of  Dadra   and   Nagar     Haveli
constituency. It is further stated that since 1 year
his          father    was    under    tremendous    pressure.          The
administration            of    Dadra    and   Nagar     Haveli         was
continuously harassing and ill-treating him. The motive
behind this harassment and ill-treatment was to take
control over the college being run by deceased and to
prevent deceased from contesting next elections. The
officials in the Administration were acting under the
dictates         of   the  Administrator,    namely,    Praful      Khoda
Patel. Under the orders of Administrator, Officers in
the          administration      were   targeting    deceased.          The
following are the certain dates and events :
I.       Deceased raised his voice against ill-acts of
the Administrator in parliament as well as to
various foras. This issue was largely publicize
in media and because of these officers in the
local   administration      as   well    the      police
officers were enraged against deceased and with
an vindictive approach these officials in the
Umesh Malani                                                 Page 12   of 101
administration     either     personally     or     through
their   henchmen       ill-treating      and    harassing
deceased.    Baseless       complaints      were        filed
against deceased. As deceased was belonging to
Scheduled   Tribe    category,    was   purposely         ill-
treated   in    the    public    functions.        Then          a
reference   is   made    in  the   FIR   to   particular
instances   wherein     deceased    was   subjected            to
ill-treatment / disrespect in public life.
II.   2nd August is celebrated as liberation day of
Dadra and Nagar Haveli. A function was arranged
on that day at Silvasa. The Administrator is
the Chief Guest of the function whereas the
Member of Parliament is the Guest of Honour. As
per  the   long    standing    convention,      which          is
followed nearly 66 years, the Administrator and
the Member of Parliament was to deliver their
respective speeches, but on 02nd August, 2020,
the   Collector    was    the   Chief    Guest      of      the
function and he only delivered the speech. Name
of  deceased    was    removed   (from    the     list         of
dignitaries).     Deceased     wanted    to   deliver            a
speech on the occasion, but, he was refrained
from   delivering     the    speech.    Deceased          made
complaint   about     this    incident    to    the       said
committee as well as to the Hon’ble Speaker,
Lok Sabha. On 02nd September, 2020 the Resident
Deputy Collector made a derogatory reference to
deceased in his letter.
III.On     a   scheduled     visit    dated    17th   and        18th
September, 2020 of Shri. Nityanand Rai, Home
Minister for State, Government of India and as
per    the  protocol     deceased    was   required           to
invite in the scheduled function, but, no such
invitation was extended to deceased in spite of
name of deceased appearing on the foundation
stone led on that day. Thus, purposely deceased
was    kept  away    from    said   function,      on      the
contrary, a false news was spread that deceased
purposely remained absent for the program and
by   spreading    such    false    news   an   erroneous
impression about the deceased was created.
IV.   Deceased    was   to    attend    a   hearing      in      the
proceeding     which    was   before    quasi    judicial
authority i.e., Deputy Collector. Deceased by
giving an letter of authority to Mr. Indrajeet
Parmar asked him to attend the hearing as his
representative on the scheduled hearing dated
07th    January,    2021     before     Apurva       Sharma
(Resident     Deputy     Collector).     In   spite           of
knowing that Mr. Indrajeet Parmar was attending
the    hearing   on   behalf    of   deceased,       Apurva
Sharma with an intention to prevent Mr. Parmar
to     represent    in     the    hearing,     purposely
prevented    Mr.   Parmar    to   participate      in      the
proceeding     and    made    a   false    and     illegal
complaint against Mr. Parmar to police station
and    further   informed     police    authorities           to
Umesh Malani                                                 Page 14   of 101
initiate action against Mr. Parmar.
V.    Under    the    orders    of    Sharad    Darade            -
Superintendent of Police, Manoj Patel - Police
Inspector   started   re-investigation    of    an     old
case i.e., Criminal Case No. 137 of 2003 and
this as an attempt to trap deceased in a false
case.
VI.   One   of  the   close   associate   of   Mr.     Patel,
Fatehsinh Chauhan prepared false and defamatory
videos of deceased and circulated these clips
on social media platforms. This was again a
purposeful act of defaming deceased as such,
deceased    issued   legal   notice   through        Adv.
VII. Mr.   Dilip    Patel,  Talathi   made   a  false        and
baseless   complaint    against   deceased     in      the
office of Administrator on 18th February, 2021
and though majority of the objections raised in
the complaint were false and baseless, but only
to harass deceased, this false complaint was
made. Then a statement made about deceased who
was an elected Member of Parliament and was
also member of Standing Committee, Lok Sabha
was    purposely    and   with   an    ill-intention
subjected   to   defamation  and  ill-treatment           by
committing breach of protocol and officials in
the administration hatched conspiracy under the
order of the Administrator.
7.            Then it is further reiterated that this was
done with designed motive with following objects:
i.    The administration either not assisting or not
hearing deceased.
ii.   By  preventing    deceased     in  official    functions
and   public    platforms,      so   there    would           be
decrease in the rapport between deceased and
public  at large     and    this   would   lead     to     his
defeat in the elections.
iii. By these acts, deceased would be subjected to
lowering   down    his   image    in  public     eye       and
either he may not contest the election or if he
contest the elections he would be defeated.
iv.   Then a reference is made to complaints made by
deceased   to  various     authorities.     Then      it      is
further stated in the FIR that deceased formed
a trust and under the said trust, one college,
namely, SSR College was being run. There is
heavy demand for admissions in this college but
the Administrator wanted to take college under
his control but present price of the property
i.e., land of the college is nearly Rs. 100
crore. The Administrator was making continuous
attempts to take control of the said college
and  also   was   making    attempts    to   reach       this
object   with   help    of    the   officials      in      the
administration.        Administrator        was          also
insisting upon for accommodating 8 trustees out
Umesh Malani                                                 Page 16   of 101
of 11 trustees of his choice and threats were
extended that if 8 trustees of the choice of
trustees are not accommodated deceased would be
implicated in false cases.
v.    An arrest of Mr. Parmar, close associate of
deceased, was effected by implicating him in
false  offence.   When    Abhinav   Delkar    informed
deceased    to   take      recourse     against         the
Administrator   by    following     legal   remedies,
deceased refused to made any complaint as per
the suggestion of Abhinav Delkar on the ground
that  if such   complaint    is made     or if      legal
remedies  exhausted    or   if   he  goes  to     media,
there may be further ill-treatment not only to
deceased   but   also    to    his   family     members
including physical injuries would be caused and
as such, deceased lodged no report as per the
suggestions of Abhinav Delkar.
vi.   It is further stated in the FIR that deceased
had clean image and except certain political
agitations,    there     is    no   other     criminal
antecedents   against    deceased.    It  is    further
stated in the FIR that deceased appeared before
the said committee and made it clear that if
the harassment is not stopped then there is no
other  option   left    with    him  but   to     commit
suicide. In spite of this, there was no change
in   the   behaviour      of    officials     in        the
administration.    It   is    further    stated       that
Umesh Malani                                              Page 17   of 101
deceased faced many adverse situations in life
boldly but because of the said ill-treatment he
was under depression and was constantly stating
to his mother to take care and ultimately he
committed suicide. It is further stated in the
FIR that deceased was apprehensive about if he
commits suicide at Silvasa there would not be a
proper   investigation   as   such,  he   purposely
committed suicide at Mumbai. Then FIR concludes
reiterating pressure of Administrator and other
officials    in   the   administration.     Then           a
reference is again made about the demand of Rs.
25 crore and control over the college.
8.             Now the Petitioners who have approached this
Court by their respective Petitions seeking quashment
of FIR, hereinafter, we may deal with the individual
Petitioners        qua   their   role   /   allegations     on      the
backdrop of FIR.
9.             Learned Counsel appearing for the respective
Petitioners         advanced   their   submissions   and      common
grounds raised by them are as follows:
I.    Taking the FIR as it stands would only reflect
that   deceased  himself   admitted   that     he      was
active   in  social   and   political  life      for        a
considerable long period. It is further admitted
that deceased had faced many adversities in his
Umesh Malani                                             Page 18   of 101
life    and   was   bold   enough    to   face       these
adversities and proceed further in his active
political career.
II. It was only the assumption and presumption of
deceased    that  officers   in  the   administration
were     acting    under    the    orders     of         the
Administrator and the private individuals were
having     the    close    association      with         the
Administrator    and  under   the   dictates     of      the
Administrator     the   private    individuals         were
acting vindictively against the deceased.
III.It was also vehemently submitted by the learned
Counsel appearing for the Petitioners that the
copy of the suicide note is not made available
to the Petitioners and it is only referred in
the FIR and as this very material piece itself
is undisclosed and withhold and the Petitioners
are left only to guess work.
IV. In so far as the incidents quoted in the FIR is
concerned,    it  is  submitted   that   there     is       no
close proximity of these incidents and the act
of committing suicide by deceased. On one hand,
it   is   specifically   stated   in   the   FIR       that
deceased was active in political and social life
for   considerable   long  period   and   was     a    bold
person and on the other hand, by referring to
such   stray   incidents  that  too   in   respect          of
certain individuals a conclusion cannot be drawn
Umesh Malani                                               Page 19   of 101
that all the Petitioners i.e., certain private
individuals and officers in the Administration
hatched conspiracy and by these stray incidents
such       a   situation    is    created    that    deceased
committed        suicide.   Thus,    mere   assumption         and
presumption are not sufficient enough to attract
the provisions of Indian Penal Code.
V.    It      is    also     submitted     by   learned      Counsel
appearing for Petitioners that the Hon’ble Apex
Court      in   the   matter   of  State    of  Haryana        and
Others Vs. Bhajan Lal and Others1, had framed
certain guidelines for exercising the powers of
this      Court    under  Section    482   of  the   Code         of
Criminal        Procedure    and    case    of   Petitioners
squarely falls in these guidelines.
VI. It is also submitted that FIR is silent on the
aspect       as   to  whether   there    was   any   personal
animus of the Petitioners with deceased and it
is only stated in the FIR that the Petitioners
were       acting     under    the    directions      of       the
Administrator. Thus, if the FIR is silent on the
aspect of the enmity or grudge being carried by
the     Petitioners      against    the   deceased     a     mere
general         and    baseless     statement     that         the
Petitioners          joined     together      and      hatched
conspiracy          under    the     directions      of        the
Administrator and as such, have committed the
offence under IPC or Atrocities Act is wholly
10.            Now  we   may  deal     with  the   submissions           of
learned Counsel appearing for respective Petitioners.
11.            Mr.   Shirish  Gupte,     learned   Senior     Counsel
appearing        for    Petitioner     –   Fatehsinh    Mohansinhji
Chauhan in Writ Petition No. 1653 of 2021, submitted
that the Petitioner is active in social and political
life since long. He was member of the Pradesh Council
and was councilor to the then Administrator of Dadra
and        Nagar  Haveli  for   the   period   1989-1993.     He      was
leader of opposition and member in Silvassa Municipal
Council from 2016-2020. Petitioner is also the Chairman
of       charitable    trust   and    this   trust   runs     various
education institutions imparting education from primary
to      graduation    level.   It   is   submitted   by  Mr.      Gupte
appearing for Petitioner that the Petitioner himself
introduced deceased in the active politics and when the
Petitioner was president of unit of political party, he
appointed         deceased    as     Secretary    of    the       unit.
Subsequently,          due    to      ideological      differences,
Petitioner separated from deceased but this was only an
ideological difference and Petitioner never carried a
Umesh Malani                                               Page 21   of 101
personal      grudge  against  deceased.  Mr.  Gupte    further
submitted that on personal front Petitioner constantly
maintained good relations with deceased and his family
members. Mr. Gupte further submitted that when deceased
was elected as Member of Parliament and had attended
meeting of Silvassa Municipal Council on 17th December,
2019, the Petitioner was elected as Councilor at that
time and on that occasion, Petitioner extended a warm
welcome      to   deceased.   Thus,   Mr.  Gupte   vehemently
submitted that mere difference in ideologies cannot be
a     reason   to  draw  a  conclusion  that  Petitioner        was
carrying a grudge and ill-motive against deceased.
12.          Mr.  Gupte  further  submitted  that  Petitioner
himself was subjected to certain actions initiated by
administration and these actions were in the nature of
complaint and certain revenue proceedings. Petitioner
immediately availed the legal remedies against these
actions. It may not be necessary to refer in detail
about the legal remedies exhausted by the Petitioner,
suffice it to say, that the Petitioner had approached
this Court also and was protected by the orders of this
Court. A detailed reference is made in the Petition
Umesh Malani                                         Page 22   of 101
about        the    other  actions    initiated   by   the    Revenue
Authorities and the remedies availed by the Petitioner.
Mr. Gupte submitted that these incidents are of the
year 2016 to 2018. Thus, the submission is, when the
Petitioner         himself   was   subjected   to  certain    actions
initiated by the officials in the administration and
the Petitioner challenging these actions by availing
legal remedies, there was no reason for the Petitioner
to     join     officials in     the  administration   leave aside
hatching any conspiracy against deceased.
13.             Mr. Gupte submitted that in so far as certain
incidents referred to in the FIR and more particularly
circulating           certain   news    items    and   videos         are
concerned, deceased himself had issued legal notice of
defamation         as   such,   when   the   deceased   was     boldly
availing the appropriate legal remedies against alleged
acts of the officials in the administration, it cannot
be said that the deceased was under pressure of the
officials. Mr. Gupte further submitted that attracting
certain provisions against the Petitioner under IPC as
well         as    under    the    Atrocities    Act,   is      wholly
unsustainable on the face of the contents of the FIR.
Umesh Malani                                               Page 23   of 101
Mr. Gupte further submitted that for attracting Section
306        of   IPC   there    are  three   pre-requisites,       namely,
intention, abetment and a positive act (of abetment).
On the backdrop of his detailed submissions, which are
quoted above, Mr. Gupte, further submitted that none of
these         pre-requisites      is   complied    with   against         the
14.             Mr.    Gupte    further   submitted     that    contents
stated         in   the   FIR   falls   too   short   to   attract        the
provisions under Sections 506, 389 read with Section
120(B)         of    IPC.    Mr.   Gupte   further    submitted         that
mechanically          attracting     the  provisions    of   Atrocities
Act against the Petitioner, is a very serious flaw and
without          their     being    any   requisite      material         the
Respondent Authority ought not to have attracted these
provisions against the Petitioner. On this count also
the        case   of    Petitioner    squarely    covered    under        the
guidelines in the matter of                 Bhajan Lal (supra). Mr.
Gupte         further     submitted     that    for   attracting          the
provisions of Atrocities Act a reference is made to
incidents wherein deceased was not invited to public
function. Mr. Gupte further submitted that all the acts
Umesh Malani                                                   Page 24   of 101
related to the said public function such as extending
invitation to the dignitaries, maintenance of protocol,
permission        for  delivering   the  speeches   in  the       said
function were to be performed by the administration.
The Petitioner had absolutely no role to play in any of
these acts. It is not even remotely stated in the FIR
that the Petitioner was to perform any of the act or
had any role in these acts to play in such a situation
the        attraction  of  provisions    under  Atrocities        Act,
is wholly unsustainable. Mr. Gupte further submitted
that firstly the Petitioner had no role to play in the
official functions and secondly, the Petitioner had no
control over the speeches of the individual persons in
that particular function as such, the attractions of
the provisions under Atrocities Act again is a serious
flaw         and subjecting   the   Petitioner   to   a   criminal
prosecution pursuant to the FIR is nothing but an abuse
of process of law and this is a fit case where this
Court can exercise its powers under Section 482 of Code
of      Criminal    Procedure,   1973   (for  short   “CrPC”)          to
protect the Petitioner from such an abuse of process of
Umesh Malani                                             Page 25   of 101
15.              In     support          of     his       submissions,           Mr.      Gupte,
learned Senior Counsel appearing for Petitioner placed
heavy         reliance         on     following             judgments:          Madan       Mohan
Singh Vs. State of Gujarat and Another2, Gangula Mohan
Reddy Vs. State of Andhra Pradesh3, Mahendra Singh and
Another Vs. State of M.P4, Geo Varghese Vs. The State of
Rajasthan          and      Anr5,       &     State       Vs.       Nalini      and    Others6.
Thus, learned Counsel prayed for allowing the Petition.
16.              Mr.      Rajiv         Chavan,           learned           Senior      Counsel
appearing for Petitioner – Manasvi Jain, Sub-Divisional
Police Officer in Writ Petition No. 1813 of 2021, by
referring to              the      FIR      submitted           that        the  allegations
against the Petitioner is only by way of a reference in
the concluding part of the FIR and it is stated that
the       Petitioner          along        with other              officials hatched a
conspiracy against deceased and caused harassment and
there         is   a    allegation             of     demand         of     the   amount        and
lodgment of false cases. Mr. Chavan further submitted
that         in   the      affidavit-in-reply                     filed       on   behalf          of
Respondent No. 2 in the Petition i.e., Abhinav Delkar,
5   Criminal Appeal No. 1164 of 2021 (arising out of SLP (Crl) No. 4512 of 2019
the first informant, an incorrect statement is made. It
is also stated that the Petitioner was involved in the
alleged      eviction  of  SSR  College.  Mr.   Chavan    further
submitted that the Petitioner neither has passed any
eviction order as she was Sub-Divisional Police Officer
at the relevant time nor was a participant in any squad
for eviction drive.
17.          Mr.   Chavan  further   submitted   that     in      the
affidavit-in-reply, Respondent No. 2 made an incorrect
statement. It is stated that Petitioner being a Sub-
Divisional Police Officer was present in the official
function of Liberation Day, by whose name deceased was
threatened      by   Mr.  Apurva  Sharma  –   Resident      Deputy
Collector       in   said   function.   Mr.   Chavan      further
submitted      that   this  statement   only   refers     to      the
presence of Petitioner in the official function in the
capacity of Sub-Divisional Police Officer. Mr. Chavan
then submitted that the other part of the statement
related to Mr. Apurva Sharma and the threats extended
by him. Mr. Chavan further submitted that a reference
is made to the eviction proceedings were of year 2020
as such, there was no proximity of time nor essential
Umesh Malani                                           Page 27   of 101
ingredients of Section 306 of IPC are established nor
there is any material against the Petitioner to attract
the provisions of Atrocities Act.
18.             Mr.    Chavan   further  submitted  that  being          an
officer occupying the position as Sub-Divisional Police
Officer, the Petitioner attended the official function
and        this    act    cannot  call  for   any  criminal     action
against the Petitioner firstly; if certain threats are
given by some other person how Petitioner can be held
responsible           for   an  act  of  third  party  or   a     third
person. Thus, Mr. Chavan submitted that any prosecution
pursuant to FIR against the Petitioner is nothing but
an abuse of process of law and this Court can exercise
its powers under Section 482 of CrPC to protect the
Petitioner from such an abuse of process of law. In
support of his submissions, Mr. Chavan, learned Senior
Counsel relied on following judgments: Netai Dutta Vs.
State        of    W.B.7,   Ude  Singh  and  Others  Vs.  State          of
Haryana8, & Gurucharan Singh Vs. State of Punjab9. Thus,
learned         Counsel     appearing  for  Petitioner  prayed        for
allowing the Petition.
19.             Writ Petition No. 1806 of 2021 is filed at the
instance of Sharad Darade. As the contents of the FIR
are already referred by us in detail, we may only state
here that in so far as the Petitioner – Sharad Darade
is concerned, in the FIR a reference is made in a later
part wherein certain instances are quoted under Caption
“ekÖ;k ofMykapk viekfur dsY;kps lkoZtfud thoukrhy izlax [kkyhyizek.ks vkgsr ”
(loosely translated as the incidences wherein my father
was       humiliated      in  public  life).   Then    it   is    further
stated          in    the    FIR   that   under    the      orders           of
Superintendent            of   Police   –   Sharad     Darade       Police
Inspector Manoj Patel started re-investigation of an
old       case    no.   137/2003 registered     at   Silvassa       Police
Station and an attempt was made to falsely implicate
deceased in said case).
20.             Mr. Thakare, learned Senior Counsel appearing
for         Petitioner     submitted   that   Petitioner      –     Sharad
Darade was officiating his duty as Superintendent of
Police in Dadra and Nagar Haveli from 08th July, 2017
till 11th January, 2021. Deceased committed suicide on
21st February, 2021. In the entire service period of
Petitioner at Dadra and Nagar Haveli from 08 th July,
Umesh Malani                                                   Page 29   of 101
2017 to 21st January, 2021 neither any single FIR nor
criminal          case   or  notice   in any   criminal  matter        was
issued          to   deceased.  By   referring   to  the  additional
documents placed on record, Mr. Thakare submitted that
in      so      far   as  cases   which   were   registered    against
deceased are concerned, the charge-sheets were already
filed          therein.    Mr.  Thakare    further   submitted       that
though in the FIR a reference is made to criminal case
no. 137 of 2003, as per the record it was the C.R. No.
147          of    2014   wherein    certain   specific    role        was
attributed           to  deceased   and  as   there  was  also       some
material against the deceased prayer for further re-
investigation was made to the Court. Prayer for re-
investigation was opposed by original complaint. Mr.
Thakare further submitted that Petition arising out of
the said matter namely, LD/VC/OCR/46 of 2020 was before
this Court and learned Single Judge vide order dated
19th May, 2020, passed following order:
Heard Mr. Marwadi learned Counsel for the
petitioner and Mr. Venegavkar, advocate for
Union Territory. Mr. Venegavkar seeks time
to file reply. Time granted.
Mr. Thakare further submitted that the said
crime         was   investigated     by  a  different   investigating
officer and not by the Petitioner nor Petitioner was
supervising the investigation and under the orders of
this Court, the investigation in the said crime was
permitted to continue. Thus, Mr. Thakare submitted that
the allegation against the Petitioner in the FIR, on
face         of   it,  are   untrue   and  wholly    contrary     to     the
record.          Mr.   Thakare    further   submitted    that    certain
additional allegations against the Petitioner comes on
record          only   by  way   of   affidavit-in-reply     filed          on
behalf          of   original    informant.    Mr.   Thakare     further
submitted           that   by    way    of   affidavit-in-reply          the
informant is trying to built entirely a new case and an
additional material is tried to be sub-planted which is
admittedly           not   part    of   FIR.   Mr.   Thakare     further
submitted that firstly, in so far as the allegation in
the        FIR     against   the    Petitioner    is  concerned,         the
allegation is vague; secondly, no role was played by
the        Petitioner     in   reference    to   crime   no.   147/2014
wherein re-investigation was sought for; thirdly, re-
investigation was continued under the orders of this
Court; fourthly, the allegation against the Petitioner
Umesh Malani                                                  Page 31   of 101
subsequently          is  sub-planted    by   way  of  affidavit-in-
reply and even these allegations are untrue and not in
consonance with the record.
21.             Mr. Thakare, thus, submitted that initiation
of prosecution or continuity of prosecution against the
Petitioner is nothing but an abuse of process of law
and        this   Court   by   exercising   inherent   powers       under
Section 482 of CrPC shall protect the Petitioner by
preventing the abuse of process of law. Mr. Thakare
further        submitted     that   in  the  affidavit-in-reply            an
allegation         is   made   against   the   Petitioner   that        the
Petitioner          may   influence    the   investigation      in      the
present crime and as the Petitioner is now transferred
from Dadra and Nagar Haveli, even this allegation and
apprehension is ill-founded. Mr. Thakare submitted that
even considering the contents of the FIR, on face of
it,       falls    too   short   to  attract   Section   306     of     IPC
against the Petitioner.
22.             In support of his submissions, Mr. Thakare,
learned        Senior    Counsel    appearing   for  the  Petitioner
placed        heavy    reliance    on  following    judgment:       Pawan
Umesh Malani                                                 Page 32   of 101
Kumar Vs. State of H.P10 & Asharfi Vs. State of Uttar
Pradesh11.           Thus,          learned    Counsel      appearing         for
Petitioner prayed for allowing the Petition.
For ready reference, we may quote paragraph 34
of the judgment in the matter of Pawan Kumar (supra),
34.       The word “instigate” literally means
to goad, urge forward, provoke, incite or
encourage to do an act. A person is said to
instigate another person when he actively
suggests or stimulates him to an act by
means      or     language,     direct    or   indirect,
whether        it     takes   the   form    of   express
solicitation or the hints, insinuation or
encouragement.            Instigation     may    be     in
(express)         words    or  may   be   by   (implied)
conduct.
23.             Mr.     Badheka,        learned  Counsel     appearing        for
Petitioner – Manoj Patel, Police Inspector submitted
that         Petitioner        himself     belongs   to   the  category          of
scheduled tribe, as such, the allegation and attempt to
attract provisions of Atrocities Act is ill-founded.
Mr. Badheka submitted that though reference in the FIR
made to C.R. No. 137/2003, in affidavit-in-reply filed
10 Criminal Appeal No. 775 of 2017.
by the informant it is stated that in C.R. No. 147/2014
he stated that it was criminal case of year 2014. Mr.
Badheka for the Petitioner vehemently submitted that
Petitioner          was   officiating  as  Station   House    Officer
only for a period of two months i.e., 21 st March, 2020
till 28th May, 2020. Mr. Badheka further submitted that
the said criminal case of year 2014 was never entrusted
to the Petitioner for investigation. Investigation was
carried out by certain other officer and the charge-
sheet was filed in the competent Court. Mr. Badheka for
the Petitioner submitted that the informant is trying
to       advance      his   case   by  some  additional     material
referred to in the affidavit-in-reply which is not the
part of the FIR and such an attempt is impermissible.
Mr.          Badheka    further   submitted   that    as   per        the
guidelines of the Hon’ble the Apex Court in the matter
of Bhajan Lal (supra), this Court while exercising its
power under Section 482 of CrPC can satisfy itself for
exercising powers on bear contents of the FIR.
24.              Mr.   Badheka   appearing   for   the   Petitioner
vehemently submitted that in the contents of FIR there
is         absolutely      no   material   about    provisions           of
Umesh Malani                                               Page 34   of 101
Atrocities Act and an attempt is made to fill up this
lacuna by making allegations in the affidavit-in-reply.
Mr. Badheka further submitted that there is substantial
change in the stand of informant i.e., Respondent No.
2. Mr. Badheka further submitted that in the contents
of the FIR an allegation is made that the Petitioner
was        acting    under   the   dictates   or  influence     of      his
superior officer i.e., Sharad Darade – Superintendent
of Police and then in the reply filed in this Court the
informant          submitted    that   the   Petitioner   was     acting
under the dictates of the Administrator. Mr. Badheka
then reiterated that the statements made in the reply
that         the   Petitioner    was  investigating    the   crime         is
wholly         untrue.    Mr.   Badheka    further   submitted        that
without admitting even assuming that certain act was
done by the Petitioner it was an official act while
discharging           duty   as    a  police    officer    under        the
directions           of    his    superior    officer    and      either
discharging official duty and following and complying
the directions of the superior officer cannot be as an
offence          leave  aside    any  of   the  offence   of    IPC        or
Atrocities Act as alleged in the FIR. Mr. Badheka, in
support of his submissions, placed heavy reliance on
Umesh Malani                                                  Page 35  of 101
following judgment: Dilip Ramrao Shirsao (supra). Thus,
learned Counsel prayed that Petition may be allowed.
25.            Mr. Rahul Walia appearing for the Petitioner –
Rohit Yadav submitted that Petitioner was working as
Law Secretary, Union Territory. Reference is made to
the Petitioner only at the concluding part of the FIR
that too in a general statement that the Petitioner
along        with   other  officials   in   the  Administration
hatched         conspiracy   under   the   directions    of       the
Administrator         harass  and   ill-treated   the   deceased
knowing well that deceased belongs to scheduled tribe
and then demanded an amount of Rs. 25 crore from him
and lodged a false cases and exerted threats to prevent
deceased         from   contesting   elections    and   harassed
deceased so as to control his education institutions /
college and by such mental harassment led deceased to
commit       suicide.   It  is vehemently   submitted  that       the
Petitioner being a meritorious candidate was selected
as Judicial Magistrate First Class. With his hard work
and       merit,   Petitioner  stood  third  in  the  merit       and
subsequently, he was granted jumping promotion. Learned
Counsel further submitted that presently Petitioner is
Umesh Malani                                            Page 36  of 101
discharging          his   duties   at   Amravati     as  Senior      Civil
Judge. Thus, the entire service career of Petitioner is
clear          and    unblemished.      Learned      Counsel      further
submitted that Respondent No. 2 – first informant in
his affidavit-in-reply had added an additional material
against Petitioner in the form of one alleged meeting.
Learned Counsel further submitted that except a general
statement         that   there   was   a   meeting    attended     by     the
Petitioner          no   other    details     are   provided     in       the
affidavit-in-reply            such   as,    when    the    meeting        was
conducted, where the meeting was conducted, who were
the participants in the meeting, whether the meeting
was        arranged    by   the  officer     in   the   administration,
whether         it    was   arranged     by   some    superior      police
official, no such details are provided.
26.             Learned    Counsel   further     submitted    that      even
for        the   sake   of   argument    it   is   assumed   that       some
official meeting was conducted by the Administration,
then in that case Petitioner who was a Law Secretary at
the relevant time was duty bound to attend the meeting
if     it     was  relating     to  certain     legal   issues.     Merely
attending the meeting being a Law Secretary by itself
Umesh Malani                                                    Page 37  of 101
cannot         be   an   offence.   Learned   Counsel   invited        our
attention          to   the   documents  placed    on  record      under
caption “duties of law officer” submitted that as per
the clause (I) (a), the Law Secretary who is judicial
officer officiating in the Dadra and Nagar Haveli on
deputation is duty bound to attend such meeting. It is
then         submitted     that   a  reference    is  made     in      the
affidavit-in-reply which is filed in July, 2021 i.e.,
after four months of lodgment of FIR as well as after
filing the Petition by the Petitioner to a matter where
aspect          of    re-investigation    is    submitted.     Learned
Counsel also submitted that in so far as that aspect of
the matter is concerned there was no role to be played
by the Petitioner in the course of investigation and
re-investigation            was  continued   by   the  investigating
officer under the orders of this Court. As such, in
that view of the matter also, the Petitioner had no
role to play.
27.              Learned Counsel appearing for the Petitioner
submitted that the caste certificate issued in favour
of the Petitioner is placed on record and considering
the sterling quality of this document this Court can
Umesh Malani                                                Page 38   of 101
accept the caste certificate for consideration without
insisting         for  any   further   scrutiny.    Learned     Counsel
placed reliance on the judgment of State of Orissa Vs.
Learned    Counsel    then   submitted    that     he       is
adopting legal submissions of learned Counsel appearing
for other Petitioners. Thus, learned Counsel prayed for
allowing the Petition.
28.            Mr.    Amit     Desai,    learned    Senior      Counsel
appearing for the Petitioner – Sandeep K. Singh in Writ
Petition         No.   1538    of  2021   submitted    that     at      the
relevant time Petitioner was working as Collector. As
per       the   contents    of   the  FIR,   apart  from   a    general
statement that officer of the administration were ill-
treating        and   harassing    deceased   under the orders             of
Administrator, no specific statement is in the form of
reference to an particular incident. The incident is of
2nd      August,    2020.    It   is  stated   that   2nd  August          is
celebrated as a liberation day in the area of Dadra &
Nagar Haveli, Union Territory and the liberation day
celebration function is scheduled at Silvassa. As per
the long standing convention for nearly 66 years, the
Administrator is the Chief Guest of the function and
the Member of Parliament is the Guest of Honour. As per
the tradition, both these dignitaries address gathering
i.e., they deliver their speeches. It is stated in the
FIR that on 2nd August, 2020, Collector himself became
the Chief Guest of function and delivered the speech.
It is further stated in the FIR that name of deceased
was removed from the list of guests and in spite of
deceased        was  willing to  address  the  gathering        such
opportunity was not given. Then deceased made complaint
about        this   incident  to   the  Parliament    Privilege
Committee. Then it is stated in the FIR that due to
said act of officers of administration and the police
officers created an impression in the minds of general
public        firstly   that the  administration   is     neither
paying any heed nor helping to deceased; secondly, with
such act whereby the attendance of deceased is avoided,
it would result in decreasing his contact with public
at large and this would lead to his defeat in election;
thirdly, deceased who had a very humble beginning and
was belonging to scheduled tribe category and with his
hard work he got elected for 7 times, by such acts
image of deceased would be lowered down in the public
Umesh Malani                                           Page 40   of 101
at large and either he may not contest the election or
he contest the election he would be defeated.
29.           Mr. Desai further submitted that the contents
in the FIR in so far as the Petitioner is concerned,
are only in the nature of assumption and presumption on
an impression carried by deceased. Mr. Desai vehemently
submitted       that   in  so  far   as   reference    made     to     the
particular incident is concerned, said incident is of
2nd August, 2020. Mr. Desai then submitted that in the
year 2020 entire world was facing a disastrous pandemic
i.e., Covid 19 and India was not exception to it. Mr.
Desai further submitted that various guidelines were
issued       by   the    Central    Government     and   the       State
Government to deal with Covid 19 pandemic. Mr. Desai
also submitted that in all the guidelines and standard
operation       procedures    the  focus    was   on  avoiding         the
gathering       and   the  crowd   in   public   places   so      as      to
control Covid 19 pandemic. Mr. Desai then invited our
attention to an order issued by the Central Government
dated 29th July, 2020. Copy of the same is placed on
record at Page 155 of the Petition. Along with this
order,       the    Ministry    of   Home    Affairs    issued         the
Umesh Malani                                                Page 41   of 101
guidelines          under   caption   “Guidelines   for   phased        re-
Pursuant    to  the   guidelines    issued     by      the
Central Government, the State Authorities as well as
Administration           of   Union   Territories    issued     various
orders and guidelines. Accordingly, the Union Territory
Administration of Dadra & Nagar Haveli and Daman Diu,
State         Disaster    Management    Authority   also   issued          an
order dated 31st July, 2020. Copy of the same is also
placed on record at page 163.
30.              Our    attention     was   also    invited       to         a
communication            under    caption    “New    Guidelines            of
Containment of Covid 19 in the Union Territory of Dadra
Nagar Haveli and Daman and Diu w.e.f. 1st August, 2020.
Copy of the same is placed on record at Page 165 of the
Petition.           Mr.   Desai   appearing    for    Petitioner           by
inviting our attention to the order dated 31 st July,
2020         and   particularly    to   later  part    in  the      order
submitted that pursuant to this limited attendance in
public functions was one of such steps. Relevant part
of the order reads thus:
Now therefore, in continuation of this

Administration’s     earlier    orders,    quoted
above in the preamble and in pursuance of
guidelines    issued  by   the   MHA,   GoI  vide
Order   dated   29th  July,    2020,   the   U.T.
Administration of Dadra & Nagar Haveli and
Daman   &   Diu   by  virtue    of   the   powers
conferred under The Epidemic Diseases Act,
1897 and the Disaster Management Act 2005,
hereby    extends    the    lockdown     in    the
containment    zones,   so    declared    by  the
District   Administration    upto   31st  August,
2020 and to re-open more activities in a
calibrated    manner   in   areas   outside   the
Containment Zones in the entire Territorial
jurisdiction of the U.T. During the above
period,     the    annexed     GUIDELINES      and
DIRECTIVES along with the SOPs which were
issued earlier for all permitted activities
shall continue to be implemented strictly.
31.            Mr. Desai further submitted that at the same
time, the Administration also took care to extend the
invitation of the liberation day to various dignitaries
and such invitation was extended to deceased also. Copy
of the said invitation is also placed on record. Mr.
Desai further submitted that the statement made in the
FIR that on account of the liberation day only the
Collector        delivered   a  speech   is   also  not   true.       Mr.
Umesh Malani                                                Page 43  of 101
Desai further submitted that liberation day function
was attended by the elected Member of Parliament for
Daman and Diu namely, Lalu Patel, Director General of
Police – Vikramjeet Singh and other dignitaries i.e.,
representative         of people   and   freedom  fighters.        Mr.
Desai then invited our attention to the copy of news
items published in the news papers placed on record at
page 176 and 177. Thus, Mr. Desai submitted that the
statement made in the FIR are not in consonance with
the record and it is only an impression carried by the
deceased.       Mr.   Desai  further  submitted   that  in         FIR
reference is made to another incident i.e., visit of
Minister – Nityanand Rai to Dadra & Nagar Haveli on 17 th
and 18th December. It is stated in the FIR that name of
deceased       was    purposely   removed   from   the  list          of
invitees. It is also stated in the FIR that deceased
was not invited timely and protocol was not followed
and        it was   falsely   spread  in   general  public       that
deceased purposely remained absent in the function with
this false statement attempt was made to lower down the
image of deceased in the public.
32.           Mr. Desai by     inviting our attention to the
Umesh Malani                                            Page 44   of 101
photographs placed on record in the rejoinder affidavit
submitted that it can be seen that all the dignitaries
were         attending    the  function    on  the   liberation         day
including deceased. Mr. Desai also submitted that apart
from these photographs, there is an entire CCTV footage
of the function available with the office of Collector
and the CCTV footage clearly show that the function was
celebrated as per protocol and all the courtesies were
extended         to   deceased.   Mr.   Desai  also   stated     in     the
rejoinder affidavit that this issue was raised by the
deceased         before    said   committee   and   explanation         was
called from Administration and the entire material was
submitted for perusal of the Privilege Committee. Mr.
Desai stated in the rejoinder affidavit that the said
committee           after    going    through    the    footage         and
Administration          have   not   further  investigated       in     the
33.             Mr. Desai for Petitioner submitted that the
Respondent No. 2 in his affidavit-in-reply submitted
that         invitation    for   the   function   of   Minister         was
belatedly extended to the deceased and there was breach
of protocol and certain material is added in the reply
Umesh Malani                                                 Page 45   of 101
which is not part of the FIR. For ready reference, we
may quote particular contentions in the affidavit-in-
11.    I say that despite the fact that the
Minister    was   scheduled    to    arrive     at
Silvassa on 17-12-2020 at 7.45pm, an e-mail
invitation regarding the official visit of
Minister   was  deliberately    sent   to   Shri.
Mohan Delkar on 17-12-2020 at 07.53 PM,
with clear intention to prevent Shri. Mohan
Delkar from attending official function. I
say  and   submit   that   sending    an   e-mail
invitation to Shri. Mohan Delkar after the
scheduled arrival of Minister clearly sows
the   malafide    intention     of    the    U.T.
Administration    Officials     including     the
Petitioner herein due to which the rights
of Shri. Mohan Delkar have been affected
being MMP. I say that as per the protocol,
“Point (V) Members of Parliament of the
area should invariably be invited to public
functions organised by Government Office.
Then invitation cards and media events, if
organised   for  the   function   held   in   the
constituency, may include the names of the
Members   of   that   constituency     who   have
confirmed participation in these function.
Point (VI) where any meeting convened by
Government is to be attended by Member of
Umesh Malani                                               Page 46   of 101
Parliament, special care should be taken to
see that notice is given to them in good
time regarding the date, time venue etc. of
the meeting. It should also be ensure that
there is no slip in any matter of detail,
however    minor   it   may   be.   It    should
especially be ensure that: a) intimations
regarding public meeting/functions are sent
through speedier communication devices to
the M.Ps, so that they reach them well in
time, and b) that receipt of intimation by
the     M.P.     is    confirmed      by     the
officer/official    concerned.   Moreover,   the
Office    Memorandum    categorically     states
that, “any violation of relevant Conduct
Rules in this regard, which violation is
established after due enquiry will render
the Government servant concerned liable for
appropriate punishment as per rule”. I say
that   the   Petitioner   and   other    Accused
played an active role in tarnishing the
self-esteem and self-respect of the victim
and destroyed his confidence so that he
would not contest the next elections.
34.            Mr. Desai further submitted that the function
of inauguration program of Nand Ghar and handing over
of three electric buses was scheduled on 18 th December,
2020 at 10.15 am and the Minister was to reach Dadra
Umesh Malani                                              Page 47   of 101
Nagar         Haveli   and   Daman    on    17th   December,        2020.
Accordingly, an email was forwarded to deceased on his
Gmail account address on December 17, 2020 at 07.53 pm.
Thus, Mr. Desai submitted that an advance intimation
was duly forwarded to deceased by following protocol
scrupulously. Mr. Desai further submitted that it is
stated in reply on behalf of Respondent No. 2 that the
communication was forwarded on an email address of an
account         which  was   not   operational,      and   there        was
another         email   account   which    was    operated     by       the
deceased. Mr. Desai further submitted that the official
email account known to the office of the Petitioner,
the       email was forwarded      and   operating another email
account and if the same is not made officially known
for correspondence, putting blames on the Petitioner is
not only unsustainable, is stretching the allegations
too far.
35.             In  so   far  as    the   visit     of   Minister          is
concerned, the copy of the tour program is annexed to
the        rejoinder   affidavit   of   the   Petitioner.       It      was
submitted         that  even   as  per   the     scheduled    program,
Minister was to reach Silvassa for only night stay at
Umesh Malani                                                 Page 48   of 101
about 07.45 pm and was to attend the function at 18 th
December, 2020 at 09.45 hours. Thus, email forwarded to
the        deceased    Member    of  Parliament    on  his    official
account         on   17th  December,    2020  at   07.56   pm     was        a
communication well in advance and it cannot be said
that the communication was forwarded to the deceased
belatedly so as to avoid his presence for the official
36.             Mr. Desai appearing for the Petitioner invited
our       attention     to   the  documents   placed   on  record          in
rejoinder affidavit to submit that the Petitioner and
the         Administration     was   extending   all   the    protocol
formalities          such    as,   invitation    to   the   deceased,
arrangements          of   vehicles    when  the   deceased     was        an
elected         Member    of   Parliament   and   attending     certain
meeting. Our attention was also invited to the orders
issued to the subordinate officers for making proper
arrangements and for following the protocol in respect
of deceased.
37.             Mr. Desai further submitted that in the FIR an
allegation is made against the Administrator that an
associate         of   deceased,    namely,  Indrajeet    Parmar        was
Umesh Malani                                                 Page 49   of 101
falsely           implicated     in   the    offence    and   by        this
explanation the Administration wanted to give a signal
to      deceased.       It   is  stated   in   the  FIR   that     he     had
disclosed this fact to his family members and when the
first          informant    suggested   his   father   to   take      legal
recourse          against    the   Administration,    deceased      stated
that in case either he takes legal recourse or goes to
media, the Administrator may go to any extent that too
he may commit a threatening act to the deceased or his
family members.
38.              Mr. Desai further submitted that on receiving
proposal           Petitioner     being   District    Magistrate          and
Detention            Authority      under     PASA    Act     initiated
proceedings           against    Indrajeet    Parmar   and   one      Rahul
Sahani. Mr. Desai then submitted that the action of the
Petitioner           was    subjected    to    Advisory    Board.         The
Advisory          Board    comprising    of   Hon’ble   Retired       Chief
Justice and two eminent lawyers, approved the order of
detention and ultimately the State Government passed a
detention order.
39.              Mr. Desai further submitted that in so far as
the          educational     institution     of   the   Petitioner           is
Umesh Malani                                                   Page 50   of 101
concerned, certain proceedings were initiated and the
deceased taking recourse to legal remedies and there
was        also   a  proceedings    in   subordinate   Courts,          an
arbitration proceeding and also in this Court. Thus,
Mr. Desai submitted that action whatsoever initiated by
the        Petitioner   was   pursuant  to   jurisdiction     of     his
official        duty,    actions   were   subjected   to   judicial
scrutiny,        in   the   judicial   scrutiny   nothing    adverse
against the Petitioner is observed. Mr. Desai further
submitted that the statements in the FIR are only in
the        form  of   mere   assumptions   and   impression      being
carried by the deceased and the official record is not
at         all   supporting     these   allegations    and       these
allegations are baseless. Mr. Desai also submitted that
on face of such material a criminal prosecution against
the        Petitioner   who   is  responsible    officer   and       had
discharged his duty by adhering to the provisions of
law and by maintaining due protocol is nothing but an
abuses of process of law and Petitioner needs to be
protected and this is a fit case to exercise inherent
powers of this Court. It was also submitted that even
on the point of proximity between the suicide committed
by the deceased and the incident alleged in the FIR
Umesh Malani                                              Page 51   of 101
either        the    offence     under    IPC   or   the   offence      under
Atrocities           Act      cannot    be    attracted     against         the
Mr. Desai further submitted that even assuming
certain acts were committed by the Petitioner, these
were acts done in its official capacity and protection
is available under Section 79 of IPC.
40.             Mr.    Desai,     in   support    of   his   submissions,
relied        on following        judgments:     Geo  Varghese     Vs.      The
State of Rajasthan and Anr (supra), Dilip S/o Ramrao
Shirsao and Others Vs. State of Maharashtra and Anr 13,
Gulab Vs. State of Maharashtra and Others14, Madan Mohan
Singh         Vs.     State     of    Gujarat     and    Others15,      Arnab
Manoranjan           Goswami      Vs.    state    of   Maharashtra          and
Others16.         Thus,      learned    Counsel     appearing    for        the
Petitioner prayed for allowing the Petition.
41.             Mr. Thool, learned Counsel appearing for the
Petitioner – Dilip Patel in Writ Petition No. 1811 of
2021, who is at the relevant time serving as Talathi in
Daman, submitted that as per the contents of the FIR
apart          from   a   general   statement   that   the      entire
administration was ill-treating and harassing deceased
at        the     instance    of   Administrator,    a  particular
statement against Petitioner is under caption that the
incidence whereby deceased was subjected to harassment
and ill-treatment. It is stated in the FIR that on 18 th
February,           2021   Petitioner   submitted   a   false         and
baseless complaint in the office of Administrator. It
is further stated in FIR that this complaint was false.
Mr.          Thool   vehemently   submitted   that   firstly,         the
complaint in so far as the Petitioner is concerned, is
clearly a vague; secondly, even assuming and admitting
there was some complaint submitted in the office of
Administrator           the  said   complaint  in   respect       of       a
proceeding before the Revenue Authority to which the
wife of the Petitioner was a party and wherein notice
was served on the wife of Petitioner through Tahsildar
of Silvassa, Circle 1. Thus, the submission is, the
contents of the FIR, on face of it, contrary to the
record and with such a vague and unsustainable material
no offence can be made out against the Petitioner &
asking the Petitioner to undergo criminal proceeding is
clearly          an   abuse   of   process  of   law.   Mr.       Thool
Umesh Malani                                               Page 53   of 101
vehemently          submitted    that    the  case     of   Petitioner
squarely covers in the guidelines of judgment in the
matter of Bhajan Lal (supra).
42.             Mr. Thool, learned Counsel appearing for the
Petitioner         submitted    that   in   the  affidavit-in-reply
filed        on   behalf    of  Respondent    No.   2    only    general
statement that the officers in the Administration are
acting under the directions of the Administrator and
ill-treating and harassing deceased is appearing. Mr.
Thool further submitted that a reference is made in the
reply to a criminal case pending before the learned
JMFC,        Silvassa     against    the   Petitioner.      Mr.      Thool
further submitted that as the said criminal case is
nothing to do with the present matter, the allegation
in       the    affidavit-in-reply      that   the    Petitioner         had
suppressed           material    from    this   Court,     cannot           be
accepted. Further the allegation that as the Petitioner
is occupying the office of Talathi and he would be in a
position          to    influence    witnesses     or    tamper        with
evidence, also cannot be accepted without their being
any material against the Petitioner.
43.             Mr.    Thool   further    submitted     that    in       the
Umesh Malani                                                  Page 54   of 101
affidavit-in-reply filed on behalf of Respondent No. 2
only         general    statement   is  made   that   there      is       a
voluminous          material   collected   during  the  course          of
investigation which would indicate prima facie that a
conspiracy          was  hatched.   Mr.  Thool  further  submitted
that though it is stated in the affidavit-in-reply that
voluminous material is collected during the course of
investigation, there is no slightest reference of any
positive act being committed by the Petitioner or any
part being played by the Petitioner in the course of
alleged conspiracy being hatched. Mr. Thool vehemently
submitted that the Petitioner himself belongs to Dedhia
community which is a scheduled tribe community, thus,
in such a situation offfence under Atrocities Act are
not attracted against the Petitioner.
44.             Mr. Thool appearing for Petitioner, in support
of       his    submissions,     placed   reliance   on  following
judgments: Hitesh Verma Vs. State of Uttarakhand and
Another17,        Manik    Taneja  Vs.  State   of  Karnataka        and

Thus, Mr. Thool appearing for the Petitioner
prayed for quashing FIR qua the Petitioner by allowing
45.             Mr. Nankani, learned Senior Counsel appearing
for Petitioner – Apurva Sharma in Writ Petition No.
1808         of  2021      submitted   that    at  the  relevant       time
Petitioner was working as Resident Deputy Collector and
as per the hierarchy of the Administration, he was a
junior officer to the District Collector. Mr. Nankani
then         submitted       that  apart   from   general  allegations
against the Petitioner certain incidences are quoted to
submit that deceased was subjected to an harassment and
ill-treatment at the hands of Petitioner. A reference
is made to the liberation day celebration. Mr. Nankani
further submitted that though it is alleged that there
was an long standing convention that while celebrating
the       liberation    day   the  Member  of   Parliament      was       to
address         gathering   and   deliver   speech,    but,    due        to
peculiar circumstance, namely, Covid 19 pandemic there
was certain restrictions. Mr. Nankani then referred to
certain         guidelines   and  these   guidelines    are    already
referred by us while dealing with the submissions of
learned         Senior  Counsel   Mr.  Amit   Deasi appearing          for
Petitioner –           Sandeep K. Singh in Writ Petition No.
1538 of 2021. It may not be necessary for us to repeat
these guidelines.
46.             Mr.   Nankani    then   submitted    that     in       the
affidavit-in-reply certain additional ground is raised
and admittedly the same is not reflecting in FIR. Mr.
Nankani further submitted that even additional ground
is raised to suggest that deceased was subjected to an
ill-treatment by this act, itself is not sustainable.
Mr. Nankani further submitted that copy of notice dated
02/09/2020 for hearing is placed on record annexed to
the        affidavit-in-reply     at  page   120.   In   the     notice
addressee is shown as Shri. Mohan S. Delkar, Member of
Parliament,         Dadra and Nagar     Haveli.   It   is submitted
that         while   making   reference   to   deceased    the       word
Umesh Malani                                                Page 57   of 101
Honorable is not used and this was done to lower down
the        image  of   deceased.  Mr.   Nankani   appearing        for
Petitioner vehemently submitted that this notice was
part of a general public notice seeking suggestions and
objections. It is further submitted that this being a
general notice, proforma are prepared and forwarded.
Learned Counsel further submitted that staff attached
to       the   office   of   Petitioner   completed   the      other
formalities, such as, adding name of the addressee in
the proforma notice. Mr. Nankani further submitted that
Petitioner was not personally writing down the name of
addressee in proforma notice. It is also submitted by
learned Counsel for Petitioner that the addressee is
shown as Mohan S. Delkar, Member of Parliament as such,
it cannot be said that there was no intention either
from the administration in general             or Petitioner in
particular to lower down the image of deceased and the
allegation added in the reply is only assumption and
presumption of the first informant without their being
any legal basis to it.
47.            Then  a  reference   is  made  to  visit    of      the
Hon’ble Home Minister for the State. This aspect is
Umesh Malani                                            Page 58   of 101
also         referred    to  by    us   while   referring     to       the
submissions of learned Senior Counsel Mr. Desai. At the
cost of repetition, we may only say that the submission
of      learned     Counsel   is   the  official    program    of      the
Hon’ble         Minister   was   scheduled   on   18th  December.         An
invitation via email was forwarded to the deceased on
official email on 17th December. Then there is another
reference to a grievance that an opportunity of hearing
was not granted to deceased. It is submitted that this
was hearing before one National Council. The notice of
the meeting was sent to representative of deceased as
well as to deceased also. On the first date of hearing,
the representative of deceased one Mr. Parmar attended
hearing.         Petitioner    under   bona   fide   belief    refused
hearing         to  the   representative.     Mr.   Nankani    further
submitted         that   it  was   a  bona   fide   mistake    of      the
Petitioner and Petitioner then rectified the error by
permitting hearing to the representative of deceased
i.e., Mr. Parmar. Mr. Nankani further submitted that
when         in   the   next    hearing    the   representative           of
Petitioner was granted hearing, the allegation that no
opportunity           of    hearing      was    granted     to         the
representative         of the Petitioner       holds   no water,          as
Umesh Malani                                                 Page 59  of 101
such,        the   contents    of   the   FIR   to  that   effect          is
48.            In so far as the allegations that officers in
the        administration    and   the   Petitioner   in   particular
failed to extend necessary protocol to deceased is also
contrary to record. The Counsel for Petitioner invited
our        attention   to   the   material    placed   on  record          to
submit        that   all   the  necessary     courtesies   under        the
protocol         were    extended     to   deceased.    It   is       also
submitted that there is no denial to these submissions.
49.            Mr. Nankani further submitted that the acts
committed by the Petitioner were in discharge of his
official duty and as such, neither any offence under
IPC nor the offence under Atrocities Act are attracted
against        the   Petitioner.     It  is   further   submitted          by
learned Counsel appearing for Petitioner that though
certain additional material in the form of minutes of
proceedings before said committee are placed on record
in       the    affidavit-in-reply,       this   is   an   additional
material which is not part of the FIR. It is further
submitted         that   even   taking    into   consideration        this
material it reveals that deceased had approached said
Umesh Malani                                                 Page 60   of 101
committee        and  detailed   hearing    took   place.     It       is
further submitted that neither the contents of the FIR
nor the additional material indicates that deceased was
depressed, on the contrary, it is stated in the FIR
that deceased was active in social and political life
for years together. He was a bold person. He had faced
many difficulties and adversities in his life. He had
contested        elections   for   more  than    7  times.      Thus,
submission of learned Counsel is, all these material
falls too short to draw a conclusion that the deceased
was under distress or depression. Learned Counsel then
submitted that he is adopting the arguments advanced by
learned Senior Counsel Mr. Desai in so far as point of
proximity is concerned.
50.            Mr. Nankani further submitted that none of the
element        for  attracting   Section   306   of  IPC    appears
either in the FIR or even in the additional material
placed before this Court along with affidavit-in-reply.
Thus, learned Counsel submitted that this is a fit case
for        exercising  inherent   powers  of   this  Court      under
Section 482 of CrPC so as to prevent abuse of process
of law. Mr. Nankani, in support of his submissions,
Umesh Malani                                              Page 61  of 101
placed heavy reliance on following judgments: Pramod
Shriram Telgote Vs. State of Maharashtra23 & M. Arjunan
Vs. State24. Thus, learned Counsel prayed for allowing
51.              Mr. Mahesh Jethmalani, learned Senior Counsel
appearing            for   Petitioner    –   Praful    Khoda      Patel,
Administrator vehemently submitted that except general
statement that too at the concluding part of the FIR,
there is absolutely no material either in the FIR or in
the reply to connect the Petitioner even remotely for
the       act     of   committing   suicide  by  the  deceased.         Mr.
Jethmalani further submitted that firstly it is stated
in the FIR that the Petitioner wanted to take control
over         the   education    institution   of  the   deceased        and
secondly, wanted to prevent deceased from contesting
elections. Learned Counsel submitted that even assuming
these two alleged acts of the Petitioner these acts are
not        leading      to  the   commission   of   suicide     by      the
deceased. Therefore, it cannot be said that there was
either any intention or any motive of the Petitioner so
as        to     attract    Section    306  of    IPC   against         the
Petitioner. Mr. Jethmalani further submitted that in so
far         as   certain     incidents    quoted   in   the    FIR       are
concerned, in none of these incidents the Petitioner
had to play any role personally or officially. These
incidents referred to in the FIR and the allegations
are          against     the   other   Petitioners     as   such,        the
Petitioner           cannot    be   held   responsible    for    certain
personal acts committed by other officials and there is
absolutely            no    supporting    material     even    remotely
referred          to   in  the   FIR,  the   allegation   against        the
Petitioner          that    under the directions      of  the    present
Petitioner other officials were acting and harassing
the deceased, is only a vague and baseless allegations.
52.              Mr. Jethmalani invited our attention to the
FIR        and    submitted     that  the   first   informant      itself
stated in the FIR that deceased submitted letter to the
petitioner on 13th January, 2021 and 14th January, 2021
against other officials in the administration. Copies
of these letters were forwarded to the said committee.
Learned Counsel then submitted that in none of these
letters not a single allegation is raised against the
Petitioner.           Mr.   Jethmalani   submitted    that   the     first
Umesh Malani                                                   Page 63  of 101
informant himself stated that when the deceased had a
talk with his family members about the alleged ill-
treatment the family members and particularly the first
respondent suggested the deceased either to go to media
or to take appropriate legal steps but in spite of
these suggestions deceased neither made any disclosure
in media nor submitted any complaint at the relevant
time (R;kauh vkeP;k lY;kizek.ks rdzkj dsyh ukgh).
53.           Mr.    Jethmalani       submitted      that   firstly        the
material placed in the affidavit-in-reply in the form
of      proceedings     of   said     committee      is   an  additional
material;        secondly,     even     after      going   through       this
material        it    cannot    be     said     that    Petitioner         had
committed any such act leading to the commission of
suicide       and   in   the    said     committee     allegations         are
reiterated        on   two   counts      namely,     control   over        the
education        institute      and      preventing      deceased        from
contesting        election.     Thus,      Mr.    Jethmalani   submitted
that FIR, on the face of it, falls too short to attract
the provisions of FIR or Atrocities Act. The continuity
of proceedings against the Petitioner who himself is
active       in   social    life      and    discharging     his     duties
Umesh Malani                                                    Page 64   of 101
unblemishly, an initiation and continuity of proceeding
against the Petitioner is an abuses of process of law
and this is a fit case wherein this Court can exercise
his inherent powers under Section 482 of CrPC.
54.            In support of his submissions, Mr. Jethmalani
placed        heavy  reliance    on   following   judgments:       Madan
Mohan Singh Vs. State of Gujarat and Another (supra),
State of Kerala and Others Vs. S. Unnikrishnan Nair and
Others,        Gulab   Vs.   State   of   Maharashtra    and     Others
(supra),         Masumsha   Hasanasha    Musalman    Vs.   State          of
Maharashtra25,        &   Dinesh    alias   Buddha   Vs.   State          of
Rajasthan26. Thus, learned Counsel prayed that Petition
may be allowed.
55.            Mr.    Rafiq    Dada,    learned    Senior      Counsel
appearing as Special Public Prosecutor for Respondent –
State vehemently submitted that by lodging the FIR son
of deceased has set the investigating agency in motion.
It is specifically stated in the FIR that though there
are various persons in the administration and the and
the Administrator being the head of the Administration,
these        persons    /  officers     were   working    under        the
Administrator. It is also stated in the FIR that a
conspiracy        was   hatched    under  the   directions     of     the
Administrator         and   pursuant    to   the  conspiracy,         the
Petitioners before this Court constantly harassed and
ill-treated deceased. Mr. Dada further submitted that
by       giving   details    about    the   various   incidents          as
referred to in the FIR and though these are different
incidents,        a   common    thread   in  all   these  incidents
leading        to  an  act   of   humiliation   and  harassment          of
56.            Mr. Dada further submitted that it is observed
in various judgments of this Court and Hon’ble the Apex
Court that the FIR is not an encyclopedia as such, the
investigating agency on lodgment of FIR conducted the
investigation and then further material is collected in
the        investigation   or    unearth   in  the   investigation.
Learned Counsel further submitted that when deceased
found that under the directions of the Administrator
the Petitioners are harassing him and it would be of no
use either approaching the media or by availing other
remedies. Deceased had approached the said committee.
The statements in the FIR get support from the minutes
Umesh Malani                                               Page 66   of 101
and the proceedings before the said committee on 11th
February, 2021 and deceased Committed suicide on 22 nd
February, 2021, as such, there is a close proximity in
the acts of ill-treatment which was disclosed before
the said committee and the act of commission of suicide
by deceased.
57.           Mr.   Dada  made    available   material  collected
during       the   course  of   investigation   in  the   form         of
statement of witnesses recorded by the investigating
agency. It is submitted that in these statements the
witnesses        supports   the   case  of   deceased.  Mr.       Dada
further        submitted    that    as  the   investigation         was
initiated as there were certain interim orders passed
by this Court, the investigation could not get further
pace. Learned Counsel further submitted that deceased
was a prominent leader in the region of Union Territory
of      Dadra   and   Nagar   Haveli.  He   was  a  member       of      a
scheduled tribe community. He had been elected for more
than 7 times and this shows that he was a respectable
leader of the area. It is further submitted that the
acts and the incidents stated in the FIR are clearly
indicative of an ill-treatment and harassment caused to
Umesh Malani                                             Page 67   of 101
deceased         at   the   hands   of  Petitioner   and   in     such        a
situation          the    investigating     agency   shall    have          an
opportunity of carrying out the investigation further
and to bring the truth before the competent Court.
58.             Mr. Dada further submitted that there is no
dispute on the principle that this Court by exercising
its powers under Section 482 CrPC can prevent the abuse
of process of law and quash the FIR but the question is
whether         the   case    of   the  Petitioners    falls     in      the
settled guidelines ?. Mr. Dada further submitted that
as certain specific incidents are referred to in the
FIR, there is also reference about the role played by
each         of   the   Petitioners     in   the   FIR   and     as      the
investigation is in progress this is not a fit case
wherein         this    Court    can   exercise   its   powers       under
Section 482 CrPC, as such, the Petitions be dismissed.
59.             Mr. Dada then referred to certain contents of
the affidavit-in-reply filed on behalf of Respondent
No. 2. Mr. Dada submitted that when deceased approached
before the said committee sought the response from the
Officers         i.e.,    some   of  the   Petitioners    before       this
Court. Mr. Dada also invited our attention to a letters
Umesh Malani                                                  Page 68   of 101
addressed            by    deceased     to    various    responsible
authorities          such   as,   Hon’ble  Speaker, Lok Sabha          and
Hon’ble         Home    Minister.   Mr.  Dada  then  submitted       that
before the said committee deceased reiterated that he
is very must disturbed and only two options are left
with         him   i.e.,   either   to  tender   resignation     or       to
commit suicide. Mr. Dada also by inviting our attention
to      the      proceeding    of   the  said  committee   that        the
Chairperson of the said committee informed deceased not
to take any extreme steps.
60.              Mr. Dada, in support of his submissions placed
heavy reliance on following judgments: P. Chidambaram
Vs.        Directorate     of  Enforcement27,   Satvinder  Kaur        Vs.
State (Govt. of NCT of Delhi) & Another 28, S. M. Datta
Vs. State of Gujarat and Another29, State of Punjab and
Others Vs. Inder Mohan Chopra and Others 30, Neeharika
Infrastructure Pvt. Ltd Vs. State of Maharashtra and
Others31, Munshiram Vs. State of Rajasthan and Another32,
Narayan Malhari Thorad Vs. Vinayak Deorao Bhagat and
Another33,          Rajeev    Kourav   Vs.   Baisahab   and  Others34,
Chitresh Kumar Chopra Vs. State (Government of NCT of
Delhi)35,         Mahendra     K.C.   Vs.  State  of   Karnataka        and
Another36, Sanju alias Sanjay Singh Sengar Vs. State of
M.P.37, & Ashrafi Vs. State of Uttar Pradesh38.
61.             Mr. Dada also submitted before this Court that
though the Counsel for Petitioner placed reliance on
the judgment in the matter of Madan Mohan (supra), is
not applicable to the present matter. Mr. Dada also
submitted          that     though   reliance   was   placed    on      the
judgment in the matter of Gurucharan Singh (supra), the
decision of the Court was after conducting the full
trial. The order of conviction was challenged in High
Court and then the order of High Court was subjected to
an appeal before the Hon’ble the Apex Court. Thus, Mr.
Dada prayed that Petitions may be dismissed.
62.             Mr.     Manoj    Mohite,   learned   Senior     Counsel
appearing for Respondent – State submitted before this
Court that though commission of suicide is a final act,
the        process  of   abetment   to   suicide   is   a    complex
process. Mr. Mohite further submitted that there are
certain         causes    for   commission     of   suicide          and
consideration of these causes can be set as a dynamics
of suicide. Mr. Mohite further submitted that it can be
stated        that   broadly    there   are   two    reasons         for
commission of suicide i.e., first internal or personal
reason and second, external factors. Mr. Mohite further
submitted that effect of these two factors depends upon
the sensitivity of a person. Mr. Mohite then submitted
that considering these facts different parameters are
required to be applied in the case of suicide. Mr.
Mohite further submitted that in the present case the
external factors, namely, ill-treatment and harassment
of the Petitioners and series of such incidents along
with the internal factor, namely, the deceased was so
depressed that no other option left to him as such he
committed        suicide.   Mr.  Mohite,   thus,  submitted        that
considering        these   aspect  of  the   matter   as   well         as
considering the fact that the investigation is still in
progress this is not a fit case for exercising powers
under Section 482 of CrPC by this Court.
Umesh Malani                                              Page 71   of 101
63.              Mr. Mohite by placing heavy reliance on the
judgment of Praveen Pradhan Vs. State of Uttaranchal
and           Another39,     submitted    that     considering           the
phraseology           of   section   107  of   IPC    the   requisite,
namely, abetment and conspiracy are reflected in the
FIR.         Mr.   Mohite   submitted   that  the    first   informant
refers to various incidents to show how the conspiracy
was          hatched    by   the   Petitioner.    Mr.    Mohite        then
submitted           that    in   the   present    matter    there           is
application of Section 120 (B) of IPC and the deceased
before the said committee reiterated the details. Mr.
Mohite          also   submitted   that  the  investigation        is       in
progress and same needs to be carried out. Mr. Mohite
further submitted that at this stage, this Court can
only see the prima facie material and Court may not
undertake the exercise of assessing or ascertaining the
veracity of the allegations. If the FIR discloses the
cognizable offence in depth scrutiny is not expected by
64.              Mr.   Mohite,   in  support   of   his   submissions,
relied on following judgments: Pawan Kumar Vs. State of
Himachal Pradesh (supra), State of Kerala and Others
Vs. S. Unnikrishnan and Others (supra), Netai Dutta Vs.
State of W.B.(supra), Kaptan Singh Vs. State of Uttar
Pradesh and Others40, & Neeharika Infrastructure Pvt.
Ltd          (supra).    Thus,    learned    Counsel     prayed        that
Petitions may be dismissed.
65.              Mr.   Ashok  Mundargi,    learned    Senior     Counsel
appearing           for  Respondent    No.    2   –   Abhinav      Delkar
submitted          that   though   the   FIR    makes   reference           to
different persons and their individual acts, these acts
will have to be treated as a joint and systematic act
for a particular object and that object was to ill-
treat and harass deceased constantly on one count or
other or by one way or other that deceased is depressed
and takes an extreme step. Mr. Mundargi also submitted
that         the   contents    of  FIR   clearly    shows    that        the
deceased was under a tremendous pressure. Mr. Mundargi
also submitted that deceased put forth his grievance
before         the   said  committee    also    and  the   proceedings
before          the   said   committee    were    conducted     on       12 th
February, 2021 and deceased committed suicide on 22 nd
February, 2021 as it raised a close proximity between
this         two   events.   Mr.   Mundargi,     in  support     of      his
submissions, relied on judgment in the matter of State
of Orissa and Another Vs. Saroj Kumar Sahoo 41. Thus,
learned Counsel prayed that Petitions may be dismissed.
66.               Mr. Ponda, learned Senior Counsel appearing
for Respondent supports the submissions of Mr. Dada,
Mr. Mohite and relied on in unreported judgment in the
matter of Jagmohan Singh Vs. Vimlesh Kumar and Others 42
dated 05th May, 2022. Mr. Ponda also submitted written
submissions and substance of his argument as well as
written submission is that there is sufficient material
in      the    FIR      and      this   Court   may  not   undertake        the
exercise         of      a     detailed     scrutiny   of   the   material
collected so far at this stage and as such this is not
a fit case for exercising the powers under Section 482
67.            Mr. Venegaonkar, learned Counsel appearing for
Respondent          No.       3    –  Union   Territory   submitted       that
officers at the relevant time now posted at different
places and if trial is permitted to proceed they will
have to attend Dadra and Nagar Haveli. Mr. Venegaonkar
further        submitted           that  the    acts  committed     by      the
42 Criminal Appeal No. 741 of 2022
Umesh Malani                                                     Page 74   of 101
Petitioners are done in their official capacity.
68.              Mr. Dada, in his usual fairness handed over a
compilation of documents collected by the investigating
agency during the course of investigation. Mr. Dada,
also made available a document under caption “ ejhu MªkbZOg
iksyhl Bk.ks] xq-j- dza- 36@21 pk izxrh vgoky ”, meaning thereby,
progress          report   of  the   investigation   conducted          by
Marine Drive Police Station in Crime No. 36/21. It may
be stated here that the suicide note referred to in the
FIR is in Gujarati language and a English translation
along with certificate of one Assistant Professor and
Head         of   Department  of   English,   is  also  placed          on
record. We deem it appropriate not to disclose the name
of the concerned person, we may only state that what is
stated in the certificate as under:
“I   am  proficient  in   English  as  well   as
Gujarati Language. I have put my signatures
on on all twelve translated pages. I have
done   this  translation   on  the  request    of
Commissioner of Police, Colaba Division on
27th February, 2021 and I have been paid
Rupees --- as my professional charges for
translation”.
69.            After perusal of material placed on record and
on      hearing     learned  Counsel   appearing     for   respective
parties,         we   are   of   the   opinion,     that    there          is
considerable          merit   in  the    submissions     of     learned
Counsel appearing for Petitioners.
70.            As   we  have   made  detailed    reference       to     the
contents of the FIR, it may not be necessary for us to
repeat these contents.
71.            The Counsel for Petitioners were justified in
submitting before this Court firstly that deceased was
in      social    and   political   life    for  considerable         long
period and it is specifically stated in the FIR that
deceased faced many adversities in the life boldly. A
reference is made to the incidents are mostly of the
public functions. It was only the impression carried
out         by  the   deceased   that    he   was   ill-treated            or
humiliated,          on  the   contrary,     there    is   sufficient
material        placed   on  record   to   show   that   in   view         of
peculiar circumstances namely, Covid 19 pandemic, these
public         functions    were    celebrated     by    taking         the
precautionary measures under the various directives and
Umesh Malani                                                 Page 76   of 101
SOPs. It was an admitted fact that in these peculiar
times the attempts were being made to avoid the large
gatherings in public places so as to prevent the spread
72.             The material placed on record clearly shows
that         in  another   function   the    deceased    was   properly
welcomed. Now in so far as other incidents, namely, the
visit of Hon’ble Home Minister for State to Silvassa,
and        no   proper   protocol   was   offered    to   deceased          is
concerned,          it  can    be  said    that    it   was   only          an
impression carried by the deceased whereas the material
placed on record shows that the deceased was informed
about the visit of the Hon’ble Minister for State well
within time on his official email address.
Though    it    is   vehemently      submitted         that
particular          email    address    was    not    functional         and
deceased         was   using   another    email   address,     but       the
communication          forwarded   to    the   deceased    is    on      his
official email account. The officers were not expected
to know that how many email accounts are operated by a
particular person and out of these email accounts, how
many accounts are functional. Petitioner and officers
Umesh Malani                                                  Page 77   of 101
concerned          communicated    details     on   an   official      email
account, no blame can be put on the Petitioner and
officers          for    not   forwarding      the    communication           on
another email account of deceased.
73.              In the reply it is submitted that the deceased
was not referred to as “Honorable” and this was an act
of      humiliation.        Again   there    is   sufficient     material
placed          on    record    to    show    that     this   particular
communication was in respect of a public notice and in
the       notice,     which was communicated          to the deceased,
reference          to   deceased    was   “Shri.     Mohan   S.    Delkar,
Member         of    Parliament”.     This    reference     now    clearly
suggests          that   deceased    was   addressed     with   a    prefix
“Shri” which certainly shows respect to a person. These
notices were proforma notices issued by the office of
the Petitioner and one cannot jump to the conclusion
that         this   act   was   a  purposeful     humiliation      of      the
74.              There    is   also    considerable      merit    in       the
submissions           of   learned     Counsel     appearing     for       the
Petitioners that admittedly deceased attended the said
committee and detailed hearings were conducted by said
Umesh Malani                                                     Page 78  of 101
75.              Perusal of translation of suicide note shows
that         the   grievance    about    the  Administrator    and       the
Officers in the administration by hatching a conspiracy
ill-treated and harassed deceased is reiterated. Then
there is a reference to certain talks with some private
persons           to     whom     deceased     expressed    the        very
apprehension that the Administrator may implicate him
in some false cases and see that he is behind bars.
Then there is a short note to the wife of deceased by
deceased, and a short note to his sons.
76.              It   is   admitted    fact   that   neither   copy         of
suicide note nor translated version of the said suicide
note         is   provided    to   Petitioners,    thus,  Counsel        for
Petitioners           submitted     that   as  the   contents    of      the
suicide         note    are   not   made  known   to  them,   they       are
unable to make any submissions on the suicide note.
Learned Counsel appearing for Petitioners were
justified           in   making     this   submissions.    Though,          we
refrain to critically analyze the said suicide note, it
can safely be said that the majority of the grievance
in the suicide note are reflected in the FIR. It is
Umesh Malani                                                   Page 79  of 101
also         stated  in   the   suicide   note     that   deceased        had
addressed the communications to higher dignitaries such
and the Hon’ble Home Minister, GoI.
77.             It is stated in the report that on receipt of
the information that deceased committed suicide on 22nd
February,         2021   in  Room   No.   512    of   Sea   Green     South
Marine         Drive, Mumbai, Accidental         Death    no.  5/21       was
registered under Section 174 of CrPC and preliminary
inquiry         was   conducted.    On   09th   March,    2021    son        of
deceased          attended    the   police     station     for    lodging
report.         His  statement    was   recorded     and   accordingly,
Crime No. 36/2021 was registered for the aforementioned
offences. Then it is stated that a special team for
investigation was constituted under the orders of the
State Government. The Assistant Commissioner of Police
was head of the team and other members of the team were
to assist the head of the team. It is stated that the
material collected during the course of investigation
is       exchange     of   communication      by    deceased,     certain
documents referred to in the FIR in respect of certain
Court proceedings or quasi judicial proceedings, a self
Umesh Malani                                                    Page 80  of 101
video prepared by the deceased, etc. It is stated that
by       drawing    necessary  panchnama    the    documents        were
collected and the video clips were also stored in a pen
drive by drawing necessary panchnama. Then reference is
made         to    certain    statements     recorded      by         the
investigating officer.
78.            It is then stated in the report that deceased
was under mental pressure. It is further stated in the
report that the investigation is now stopped at this
stage         and    for   further    investigation       custodial
interrogation of the Petitioners is necessary. We may
state that by way of an interim order, Petitioners were
protected and the investigating agency was permitted to
record the statement of Petitioners. It is stated in
the        report   that  the   Petitioners    who   have     hatched
conspiracy under the orders of the Administrator and
the Administrator had two fold object against deceased.
Firstly to take control of the educational institutions
particularly,         college   being  run    by    the  trust           of
deceased        and  secondly,   to prevent the deceased            from
contesting elections. In so far the second object is
concerned, it is admitted fact that the deceased in an
Umesh Malani                                               Page 81   of 101
earlier election contested election as a candidate of
political party           and   he   was  elected   subsequently,           he
contested election as an independent member and he was
again elected.
Thus,    learned     Counsel    appearing     for        the
Petitioners submitted that when it is an admitted fact
that         deceased   contested     election   as   an  independent
member and was elected, it clearly show that there was
no substance in the allegation in so far as the second
object is concerned. It is then submitted by learned
Counsel for Petitioners in so far as first object is
concerned,         even     for    that   object    only    with       bare
allegations, there is absolutely no other material to
show any positive and active role played by any of the
Petitioners either personally to take control of the
college being run under the trust of the deceased or
assisting the Administrator by any direct or indirect
way        so   as  to  facilitate      the  Administrator     to      take
control over the college. In such a situation, if both
these alleged objects are not substantially established
and it is only in the form of certain allegations and
an       impression      of   the    deceased,   then    on   such          an
unacceptable          and    unsustainable    material    asking         the
Umesh Malani                                                  Page 82   of 101
Petitioners            to    undergo   the     rigors     of    criminal
prosecution, is nothing but an abuse of process of law.
79.              Mr. Dada and Mr. Mohite vehemently submitted
that          as    the    investigation      is    in    process         and
investigating authority be permitted to complete the
investigation,           it is    further   submitted    that   at      this
stage it may not be apt to allow the Petitions. It is
also         submitted     that    let   the   investigating        agency
complete the task of investigation.
In support of this submissions, reliance was
placed on the various judgments. Though there cannot be
any dispute on the proposition of law reflected in the
judgments,          we   are   of  the  opinion,    that   the    learned
Counsel appearing for the Petitioners were justified in
submitting before this Court these judgments are not
applicable in view of the facts of the present case.
80.              It is a consistent view of the Hon’ble the
Apex Court as well as this Court that for consideration
of the matter while exercising powers of this Court
under Section 482 CrPC, this Court is not expected to
undertake           the    exercise    of    detailed     scrutiny           or
assessment            of    the    material      collected     in         the
Umesh Malani                                                   Page 83   of 101
investigation, and it is expected from this Court to go
through the contents of the FIR and material along with
it.        As   such,    we  have   only   made   reference    to      the
material collected during the course of investigation
and refrain ourselves from any scrutiny or assessment
of this material of the investigation.
81.             There    is   also   considerable    merit    in       the
submissions         of     learned   Counsel    appearing   for        the
Petitioners that the contents of FIR falls too short
for attraction of 120 (B) of IPC. So as to attract
Section 120 (B), there must be positive material to
show that the Petitioners came together for hatching a
conspiracy and effect was given to that conspiracy. In
the present case except bare words that the Petitioners
were acting under the directions of Administrator there
is not a single incident to show that these Petitioners
came         together   and   acted   under  the   dictates    of      the
82.             In so far as the attraction of Atrocities Act
is concerned, even the contents of the FIR falls too
short for attracting the provisions of Atrocities Act.
It      is     only   an   allegation    in  the   report  that        the
Umesh Malani                                                Page 84   of 101
deceased was belonging to scheduled tribe community and
this fact was known to the Petitioners and Petitioners
have harassed and ill-treated deceased. Now in support
of        these    allegations,    reference     is    made    to       the
incidents i.e., function of liberation day and visit of
At the cost of repetition, we may state that
firstly there was sufficient material placed on record
to show that the particular function of liberation day
was        performed    under  the   directions     of   GoI    on      the
backdrop        of   pandemic   situation.     The  dignitaries         who
have attended the function were welcomed. We have also
made a detailed reference to the grievance in so far as
deceased wherein the word Hon’ble missing.
83.            There    is   also   considerable      merit    in       the
submissions           of    learned     Counsel      appearing          for
Petitioners that in so far as attraction of Section 306
of IPC, the pre-requisite is abetment. There must be
material        of   a  positive   act,   as   a  pre-requisite         for
satisfying the word abetment, the contents of FIR and
reference made to incidents falls too short to show any
positive        act   committed   by  the    Petitioners    so     as      to
Umesh Malani                                                 Page 85   of 101
satisfy the term abetment which is a pre-requisite of
Section 306 of IPC. It may not be out of place to quote
the observations of the Hon’ble the Apex Court while
dealing with Section 306 of IPC in the matter of Madan
Mohan Singh (supra) as under:
10.    We    are   convinced     that   there    is
absolutely nothing in this suicide note or
the   FIR   which   would    even   distantly    be
viewed    as   an   offence    much   less   under
Section    306,    IPC.   We    could   not   find
anything in the FIR or in the so-called
suicide note which could be suggested as
abetment to commit suicide. In such matters
there   must    be   an  allegation     that   the
accused    had   instigated    the   deceased     to
commit   suicide    or  secondly,    had   engaged
with some other person in a conspiracy and
lastly, that the accused had in any way
aided any act or illegal omission to bring
about the suicide.
11.    In   spite   of  our   best   efforts   and
microscopic examination of the suicide note
and the FIR, all that we find is that the
suicide note is a rhetoric document in the
nature of a departmental complaint. It also
suggests some mental imbalance on the part
of the deceased which he himself describes
Umesh Malani                                                Page 86   of 101
as  depression.    In  the  so-called    suicide
note, it cannot be said that the accused
ever intended that the driver under him
should commit suicide or should end his
life and did anything in that behalf. Even
if it is accepted that the accused changed
the duty of the driver or that the accused
asked him not to take the keys of the car
and to keep the keys of the car in the
office itself, it does not mean that the
accused intended or knew that the driver
should commit suicide because of this.
12.    In   order  to  bring   out   an  offence
under Section 306, IPC specific abetment as
contemplated by Section 107, IPC on the
part of the accused with an intention to
bring   out   the  suicide  of   the   concerned
person   as  a  result   of  that  abetment    is
required. The intention of the accused to
aid or to instigate or to abet the deceased
to  commit    suicide   is  a   must   for  this
particular offence under Section 306, IPC.
We are of the clear opinion that there is
no question of there being any material for
offence under Section 306, IPC either in
the FIR or in the so-called suicide note.
13.    It is absurd to even think that a
superior officer like the appellant would
intend to bring about suicide of his driver
Umesh Malani                                              Page 87   of 101
and, therefore, abet the offence. In fact,
there is no nexus between the so called
suicide (if at all it is one for which also
there is no material on record) and any of
the   alleged    acts   on    the   part    of    the
appellant. There is no proximity either. In
the   prosecution    under   Section    306,    IPC,
much more material is required. The Courts
have to be extremely careful as the main
person     is   not    available      for    cross-
examination      by    the     appellant/accused.
Unless,     therefore,     there     is   specific
allegation and material of definite nature
(not   imaginary    or   inferential     one),       it
would      be     hazardous      to     ask       the
appellant/accused     to   face    the   trial.        A
criminal trial is not exactly a pleasant
experience. The person like the appellant
in   present    case   who    is   serving     in      a
responsible    post    would    certainly    suffer
great     prejudice,     were      he    to     face
prosecution     on    absurd     allegations         of
irrelevant      nature.      In     the     similar
circumstances, as reported in Netai Dutta
Vs. State of W.B. [2005 (2) SCC 659], this
Court had quashed the proceedings initiated
against the accused.
14.     As regards the suicide note, which
is a document of about 15 pages, all that
Umesh Malani                                                   Page 88   of 101
expressed by the driver who felt that his
boss (the accused) had wronged him. The
suicide note and the FIR do not impress us
at   all.   They    cannot     be   depicted     as
expressing anything intentional on the part
of  the   accused   that   the    deceased  might
commit  suicide.    If  the    prosecutions   are
allowed to continue on such basis, it will
be  difficult   for   every    superior   officer
even to work.
Similarly, the Hon’ble the Apex Court in the
matter        State  of   Kerala    Vs.   S.    Unnikrishnana       Nair
(supra), observed as follows:
9. To appreciate the rivalised submissions
in  the   obtaining   factual     matrix,  it   is
necessary   to   understand     the   concept    of
abatement as enshrined in Section 107 IPC.
The said provision reads as follows:-
“107. Abetment of a thing. -           A person
abets the doing of a thing, who –
First – Instigates any person to do that
Secondly – Engages with one or more other
person or persons in any conspiracy for the
doing of that thing, if an act or illegal
omission takes place in pursuance of that
Umesh Malani                                               Page 89   of 101
conspiracy, and in order to the doing of
Thirdly – Intentionally aids, by any act
or  illegal   omission,    the  doing  of   that
thing.
Explanation 1. – A person who, by wilful
misrepresentation, or by wilful concealment
of a material fact which he is bound to
disclose, voluntarily causes or procures,
or attempts to cause or procure, a thing to
be done, is said to instigate the doing of
that thing.
Explanation 2 – Whoever, either prior to
or at the time of commission of an act,
does anything in order to facilitate the
commission    of    that   act,   and   thereby
facilitates the commission thereof, is said
to aid the doing of that act.”
16. We have quoted in extenso from the said
judgment   and   we   have   no  hesitation    in
stating that the suicide note therein was
quite different, and the Court did think it
appropriate    to    quash    the   proceedings
because  of  the    tenor  and  nature  of   the
suicide note. Thus, the said decision is
distinguishable    regard   being  had  to   the
factual score exposited therein.
17. Coming to the case at hand, as we have
Umesh Malani                                              Page 90   of 101
stated  earlier,     the   suicide     note   really
does not state about any continuous conduct
of harassment and, in any case, the facts
and circumstances are quite different. In
such a situation, we are disposed to think
that   the   High    Court     is    justified       in
quashing   the    proceeding,      for   it   is    an
accepted   position     in  law    that    where    no
prima facie case is made out against the
accused, then the High Court is obliged in
law  to   exercise     the   jurisdiction       under
Section   482   of   the   Code    and   quash    the
proceedings.     [See    V.P.     Shrivastava       v.
18. Before parting with the case, we are
impelled   to   say   something.      Mr.   Bhushan,
learned     counsel      appearing        for     the
respondent    No.    1   &   2    has    drawn    our
attention to a facet of earlier judgment of
the   High    Court    wherein      it    has    been
mentioned that at one time the deceased was
pressurised by some superior officers. We
have independently considered the material
brought   on   record     and   arrived      at   our
conclusion. But, regard being had to the
suicide note and other concomitant facts
that have been unfurled, we are compelled
to  recapitulate     the   saying     that   suicide
reflects a “species of fear”. It is a sense
Umesh Malani                                                   Page 91   of 101
of defeat that corrodes the inner soul and
destroys the will power and forces one to
abandon one’s own responsibility. To think
of self-annihilation because of something
which  is  disagreeable  or   intolerable    or
unbearable, especially in a situation where
one is required to perform public duty, has
to be regarded as a non-valiant attitude
that is scared of the immediate calamity or
self-perceived consequence. We may hasten
to add that our submission has nothing to
do when a case under Section 306 IPC is
registered in aid of Section 113A of the
84.            Learned Counsel appearing for the Petitioners
were also justified in placing heavy reliance on the
judgment of Dilip Shirsao (supra). It may not be out of
place to reproduce observations as under:
13.  The  Apex Court  in   Sanju  @  Sanjay
Sengar's   case   considered    the   earlier
judgments in paragraphs 9 to 12 of the said
judgment. It would be appropriate to refer
"9. In Swamy Prahaladdas v. State of M.P.,
1995 Supp. (3) SCC 438, the appellant was
charged for an offence under Section 306
I.P.C. on the ground that the appellant
Umesh Malani                                           Page 92   of 101
during the quarrel is said to have remarked
the deceased 'to go and die'. This Court
was of the view that mere words uttered by
the accused to the deceased 'to go and die'
were   not   even   prima   facie   enough     to
instigate the deceased to commit suicide.
10. In Mahendra Singh v. State of M.P.,
1995 Supp.(3) SCC 731, the appellant was
charged for an offence under Section 306
I.P.C   basically    based   upon   the   dying
declaration of the deceased, which reads as
"My mother-in-law and husband and sister-
in-law   (husband's   elder   brother's   wife)
harassed me. They beat me and abused me. My
husband Mahendra wants to marry a second
time. He has illicit connections with my
sister-in-law. Because of those reasons and
being harassed I want to die by burning."
11. This Court, considering the definition
of  'abetment'   under   Section  107   I.P.C.,
found that the charge and conviction of the
appellant for an offence under Section 306
is not sustainable merely on the allegation
of harassment to the deceased. This Court
further    held    that    neither    of    the
ingredients of abetment are attracted on
the statement of the deceased.
Chhattisgarh (2001) 9 SCC 618, this Court
while considering the charge framed and the
conviction for an offence under Section 306
I.P.C. on the basis of dying declaration
recorded  by   an   Executive   Magistrate,     in
which she had stated that previously there
had been quarrel between the deceased and
her husband and on the day of occurrence
she had a quarrel with her husband who had
said that she could go wherever she wanted
to go and that thereafter she had poured
kerosene   on   herself   and   had  set   fire.
Acquitting the accused this Court said :
"A word uttered in a fit of anger or
emotion without intending the consequences
to actually follow cannot be said to be
instigation. If it transpires to the court
that  a   victim     committing    suicide   was
hypersensitive     to    ordinary    petulance,
discord  and   difference    in  domestic   life
quite common to the society to which the
victim belonged and such petulance, discord
and difference were not expected to induce
a similarly circumstanced individual in a
given   society    to   commit    suicide,   the
conscience   of   the   court   should  not    be
satisfied for basing a finding that the
accused charged for abetting the offence of
Umesh Malani                                              Page 94   of 101
suicide should be found guilty."
21. Perusal of the said suicide note would
not reveal as to on what date the deceased
has written the suicide note. However, even
taking the allegations to be true at its
face value, the question would be as to
whether   is    it   sufficient     to   book   the
persons  like    applicants     for   the  offence
punishable under Section 306 of the Indian
Penal   Code.      Perusal     of    the   various
statements     recorded     of     the   employees
working under the deceased would show that
the deceased had never made any complaint
with regard to any of the applicants. No
doubt  that   there    is  a   statement    of  one
Judicial     Officer,     who      had    friendly
relations    with    the   deceased,     that   the
deceased was disturbed on account of he
being transferred to Darwha and not being
permitted to do up and down from Darwha and
on account of certain event that happened
in the workshop. The question would be as
to  whether    the   fact   of   a   person   being
disturbed on account of official act done
by a superior would be sufficient to book
such a superior officer for the offence
punishable under Section 306 of the Indian
Penal Code or not. We find that the issue
is squarely answered by the Apex Court in
Umesh Malani                                                 Page 95   of 101
Madan   Mohan    Singh's     case   cited    supra.
(Emphasis supplied).
22. As has been held by Their Lordships of
the Apex Court that for permitting a trial
to  proceed    against    the   accused    for  the
offence punishable under Section 306 of the
Indian Penal Code, it is necessary for the
prosecution     to    at    least    prima    facie
establish that the accused had an intention
to aid or instigate or abet the deceased to
commit    suicide.      In    the     absence     of
availability of such material, the accused
cannot be compelled to face trial for the
offence punishable under Section 306 of the
Indian   Penal   Code.   As   has  been    held   by
Their   Lordships    of   the   Apex   Court   that
abetment     involves      mental     process      of
instigating     a   person     or   intentionally
aiding a person in doing of a thing and
without a positive act on the part of the
accused in aiding or instigating or abeting
the deceased to commit suicide, the said
persons cannot be compelled to face the
trial. Unless there is clear mens rea to
commit an offence or active act or direct
act,   which   led   the    deceased    to   commit
suicide    seeing    no    option    or   the   act
intending to push the deceased into such a
position,   the    trial   against    the   accused
Umesh Malani                                                 Page 96   of 101
under Section 306 of the Indian Penal Code,
in our considered view, would be an abuse
of process of law.
23. No doubt that the judiciary has lost
one  of   its   officers    in    an   unfortunate
incident. However, as held by the Hon'ble
Supreme Court, the response of a person to
a situation may differ from a person to
person. A person, who is sensitive, may be
hurt if the things do not happen as per his
wish and may unfortunately commit an act,
which leads to his death. No doubt, our all
sympathies    are   with   the    family   of  the
Judicial   Officer,    who   lost    his  life   in
prime age. However, can that be said to be
sufficient to prosecute the other Judicial
Officers,    for   no   fault    of    theirs.    As
already    discussed      hereinabove,      except
applicant no.1, there is not even whisper
in the affidavit of the non-applicant no.2
insofar    as    the   other     applicants    are
concerned. Even the allegations against the
applicant no.1 are with regard to discharge
of  his  official     duties.    As   pointed  out
hereinabove, it cannot also be a case of
harassment inasmuch as the deceased was the
junior most Judicial Officer in the cadre
of   Civil     Judge    Senior     Division    and
transferring     him   out    of    the   District
Umesh Malani                                                Page 97   of 101
headquarters to another place in the same
district, cannot be said to be an act by
the applicant no.1 causing harassment to
the  deceased.  If   the    deceased   had   any
grievance  against   his   superiors,    it  was
always open for him to approach the learned
Guardian Judge of the District or Registry
of this Court.
85.            Learned Counsel appearing for Petitioners were
also justified in submitting before this Court the case
of Petitioners squarely covers under the guidelines in
the matter of Bhajan Lal (supra). It may be useful for
our purposes to refer to these guidelines as under:
(1) Where the allegations made in the First
Information Report or the complaint, even
if they are taken at their face value and
accepted in their entirety do not prima
facie constitute any offence or make out a
case    against     the      accused.(Emphasis
supplied).
(2)  Where  the  allegations     in  the   First
Information Report and other materials, if
any,   accompanying    the    F.I.R.   do    not
disclose a cognizable offence, justifying
an investigation by police officers under
Section 156(1) of the Code except under an
order of a Magistrate within the purview of
Umesh Malani                                              Page 98   of 101
(3)   Where   the    uncontroverted     allegations
made   in  the    FIR    or   'complaint   and   the
evidence collected in support of the same
do   not  disclose      the    commission   of   any
offence and make out a case against the
accused.
(4) Where the allegations in the FIR do not
constitute      a     cognizable     offence     but
constitute only a non-cognizable offence,
no investigation is permitted by a police
officer without an order of a Magistrate as
contemplated under Section 155(2) of the
(5) Where the allegations made in the FIR
or complaint are so absurd and inherently
improbable on the basis of which no prudent
person can ever reach a just conclusion
that    there     is    sufficient     ground    for
proceeding against the accused.
(6) Where there is an express legal bar
engrafted in any of the provisions of the
Code or the concerned Act (under which a
criminal proceeding is instituted) to the
institution       and     continuance      of    the
proceedings      and/or     where    there    is      a
specific    provision      in   the  Code   or   the
concerned      Act,      providing      efficacious
Umesh Malani                                                  Page 99   of 101
redress for the grievance of the aggrieved
party.
(7)    Where    a   criminal     proceeding      is
manifestly attended with mala fide and/or
where     the   proceeding     is    maliciously
instituted    with   an  ulterior    motive   for
wreaking vengeance on the accused and with
a view to spite him due to private and
personal grudge.”
86.             Considering all these aspects, we find merit
in the submissions of learned Counsel appearing for the
Petitioners and in our opinion, these are the fit cases
so      as     to  exercise   the   powers   of  this   Court      under
Section 482 of CrPC to prevent an abuse of process of
87.             Accordingly,    Writ  Petitions    are  allowed        and
the FIR bearing C.R. No. 36 of 2021 dated 09th March,
2021, registered at the instance of Respondent No. 2 –
Abhinav Delkar with Marine Drive Police Station, Mumbai
for the offences punishable under Sections 306, 506,
389,         120-B   of   Indian   Penal   Code,   1860   read       with
Sections 3 (1)(N), 3(1)(P), 3(2)(ii), 3(2)(Va) of the
Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of

Atrocities) Act, 1989, is quashed and set aside qua
Petitioners herein only. Rule made absolute in above
88.          In view of disposal of Writ Petitions, pending
applications,       if    any,  does    not   survive         for
consideration and the same are accordingly disposed of.
89.           The sealed packets containing suicide note in
Gujarati      along  with  its translation  were  taken          on
record vide order dated 27th June, 2022 and which were
marked as ‘X’ and ‘X1’ for identification. In view of
the disposal of the Writ Petitions, the Investigating
Agency shall approach the Registrar (Judicial-I) and
obtain those two sealed packets.
