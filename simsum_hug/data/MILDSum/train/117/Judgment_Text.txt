Special Government Pleader for R1 to R3, R5 & R7
Mr.P.Gunasekaran for R4
The order of rejection, dated 12.07.2016, passed by the fifth
respondent and the consequential order dated 10.05.2019, passed by the
seventh respondent, rejecting the claim of the petitioner for reckoning the
period of services rendered by him as Junior Drafting Officer in Tamil Nadu
Water Supply and Drainage Board (for brevity “TWAD Board”) are under
challenge in this writ petition.
2. The petitioner is working as Assistant Executive Engineer in
Rural Development and Panchayat Raj Department.                   He joined in the
W.P.(MD) No.12810 of 2019
Department on 24.11.2007 as Assistant Engineer through Tamil Nadu Public
Service Commission and his services were regularized and at present, he is
working as Assistant Executive Engineer.
3. The petitioner states that he served as Junior Drafting Officer
in TWAD Board from 05.05.1993 to 23.11.2007. The petitioner, while working
as Junior Drafting Officer in TWAD Board, appeared in the selection process
for recruitment to the post of Assistant Engineer conducted by the Tamil Nadu
Public Service Commission.           It is specifically stated that the petitioner
obtained permission from TWAD Board to participate in the selection process.
The petitioner was subsequently selected and appointed as Assistant Engineer
in the Rural Development and Panchayat Raj Department and thereafter, he
resigned the post of Junior Drafting Officer and got relieved himself from
TWAD Board and joined in the Rural Development and Panchayat Raj
Department as Assistant Engineer.
4. The grievance of the petitioner is that the services rendered by
him as Junior Drafting Officer in TWAD Board from 05.05.1993 to 23.11.2007
has not been taken into consideration by the respondents for reckoning the
qualifying service period for grant of pensionary benefits.              The petitioner
W.P.(MD) No.12810 of 2019
submitted an application for the said grievance and it was rejected by the fifth
respondent stating that he resigned the post of Junior Drafting Officer in
TWAD Board and further, the account for provident fund was separately
maintained by TWAD Board and Rural Development and Panchayat Raj
Department and therefore, the request of the petitioner cannot be considered.
5. It is relevant to refer Tamil Nadu Pension Rules, 1978 (for
brevity “the Rules) in this regard. Rule 23 of the Rules stipulates forfeiture on
service on resignation.        Sub-Rule (1) to Rule 23 states resignation from a
service or post entails forfeiture of past service. Provided that a resignation
shall not entail forfeiture of past service if it has been submitted to take up
with        proper  permission,   another   appointment,    whether     temporary or
permanent, under the Government where service qualifies.
6. As far as TWAD Board is concerned, the petitioner obtained
proper permission from the Competent Authority and such permission was
accorded vide proceedings dated 05.01.2007.          After selection, the petitioner
resigned his post in TWAD Board and joined in the Rural Development and
Panchayat Raj Department. When permission has been properly granted by
TWAD Board and pursuant to the said permission, the petitioner resigned his
W.P.(MD) No.12810 of 2019
post in TWAD Board and thereafter, joined in the Rural Development and
Panchayat Raj Department, proviso to Rule 23(1) of the Rules would be
applicable. The proviso to Rule 23(1) of the Rules in clear terms stipulates
that resignation shall not entail forfeiture of past service if it has been
submitted to take up with proper permission, another appointment, whether
temporary or permanent, under the Government where service qualifies.
7. In the present case, the petitioner obtained proper permission
from the Executive Engineer of TWAD Board vide proceedings dated
05.01.2007.         Once permission is granted, the resignation become its
consequential and cannot be considered as an independent resignation so as
to invoke the forfeiture clause.     The subjective satisfaction of the Authority
concerned in this regard is relevant for the purpose of conferring a right to the
employee. Once a resignation is independent, without reference to any such
permission granted by the Competent Authority, then such resignation
amounts to forfeiture of services under Rule 23 of the Rules. However, if the
Competent Authority has granted permission under the Rules and pursuant to
the permission, the employee joined in the new post by resigning his post,
such resignation is to be construed as continuation of permission, which is
complied with for the purpose of relieving from the particular post and such
W.P.(MD) No.12810 of 2019
resignation will not disentitle an employee from getting the benefit of counting
the period of services under the proviso to Rule 23(1) of the Rules.         In the
absence of any such distinction, the very purpose of obtaining and granting
permission will be defeated. TWAD Board was very much aware of the fact
that the petitioner obtained permission and participated in the process of
selection. Therefore, the resignation of the petitioner cannot be considered as
an independent resignation and it is to be considered as consequential to the
permission granted by TWAD Board, which would not attract forfeiture of
services under Rule 23, but falls under proviso to Rule 23(1) of the Rules.
8. The learned counsel for the petitioner further brought to the
notice of this Court that in similar circumstances, the Government has
granted the benefit of reckoning the period of past service as qualifying service
period in favour of one Mr.Vetriveeran under G.O.(Ms) No.144, Rural
Development and Panchayat Raj (E3) Department, dated 10.12.2021.
9. This Court is of the considered opinion that once the petitioner
established that he secured appointment through Tamil Nadu Public Service
Commission and joined in Rural Development and Panchayat Raj Department
and he participated in the process of selection only after obtaining proper
W.P.(MD) No.12810 of 2019
permission from TWAD Board and consequently, resigned the post in
continuation of permission granted, then there is no reason to deny the benefit
of reckoning the period of past service rendered by him in TWAD Board as
qualifying service period.
10. Accordingly, the writ petition is allowed and the order, dated
12.07.2016, passed by the fifth respondent and the consequential order dated
10.05.2019,       passed  by   the  seventh    respondent,     are  quashed.       The
respondents are directed to reckon the period of service rendered by the
petitioner as Junior Drafting Officer in TWAD Board from 05.05.1993 to
23.11.2007 as qualifying service period for the purpose of calculation of
pensionary benefits and pass appropriate orders to that effect.             It is made
clear that the amount already received by the petitioner from TWAD Board
towards terminal benefits or otherwise is to be adjusted, while settling the
eligible amount to the petitioner.         No costs.      Consequently, connected
miscellaneous petitions are closed.
