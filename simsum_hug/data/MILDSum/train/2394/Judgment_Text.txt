1.     The present Writ Petition under Article 226 of the Constitution
of India read with Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure,
1973 (“Cr.P.C.”) has been filed by petitioner for issuance of writ in
the nature of Certiorari for quashing of the order dated 03.11.2022
passed by the respondent rejecting the application of the petitioner
seeking parole and also for issuance of writ in the nature of
Mandamus, directing the respondent to release the petitioner on
parole for a period of four (04) weeks on the ground of filing Special
Leave Petition (“SLP”) before the Hon’ble Supreme Court of India
against the judgment dated 04.07.2022 passed by this Court in
Criminal Appeal No. 391/2021 whereby the conviction and order on
sentence was passed by learned Additional Sessions Judge, Saket
2.     In the present case, the petitioner was arrested in FIR bearing
No. 60/2014 registered at Police station Ambedkar Nagar, Delhi and
vide judgment dated 05.12.2019, he was convicted under Sections
363/376(2) of Indian Penal Code, 1860 read with Section 6 of
POCSO Act by learned ASJ-05, Special Court (POCSO), Saket
Court, New Delhi and vide order on sentence dated 19.12.2019, the
petitioner was sentenced to undergo rigorous imprisonment for ten
years alongwith fine of Rs.5,000/- and in default, further rigorous
imprisonment for 30 days under Section 376(2) of IPC, and to
undergo rigorous imprisonment for seven years and fine of Rs.5,000/-
and in default, further rigorous imprisonment for 30 days.
3.     Learned Counsel for the petitioner states that the petitioner is
presently confined in Central Jail No. 14, Mandoli, New Delhi and
has already undergone incarceration of about 8 years and 6 months
(excluding remission) out of R.I. for ten (10) years and fine. It is
stated by learned counsel for the petitioner that petitioner desires to
file an SLP for which he has sought parole. It is further stated that an
application dated 23.09.2022 was filed before the Home Department,
Government of NCT of Delhi and the same was dismissed by
respondent vide letter dated 03.11.2022, observing that there were no
special circumstances that existed for grant of parole and the convict
could file SLP from the jail itself where free legal aid is available to
all prisoners.
4.      On the other hand, learned APP for the State submits that
considering his conduct in the jail as per Rules, parole cannot be
granted to the petitioner.
5.      Attention of this Court has been drawn by learned APP for the
State to the fact that the present applicant is not entitled to parole in
view of Rule 1210 sub rule (II) and Rule 1211 of Delhi Prison Rule,
2018. It is stated that as per the nominal roll, the present applicant has
been awarded multiple punishments on 09.10.2021, 15.02.2022 and
07.06.2022. He therefore states that there is no illegality in the order
passed by the competent authority i.e. Deputy Secretary, Home, NCT
of Delhi and, therefore, the petition be rejected.
6.      It would be useful to reproduce Rule 1211 for ready reference,
“ 1211. In the following cases, parole shall not be granted,
except, if in the discretion of the competent authority special
circumstances exist for grant of parole;
VII. If the prisoner is convicted under POCSO.”
7.      The bar in the said rule is not absolute since the competent
authority has the discretion, even in such cases, to grant parole,
provided there exist special circumstances. Though the special
circumstances were to be considered by the competent authority, the
impugned order does not refer to the special circumstances and that
they were found insufficient for grant of parole, rather it only
mentions that the SLP can be filed from the jail itself and that the
conduct of the applicant was not satisfactory.
8.     In this Court’s opinion, the right of a citizen to avail a legal
remedy in the final court of country, which may often be the last
ray of hope, cannot be denied on such ground.
9.     As per Rule 1211 of Delhi Prison Rule, 2018, it clearly
mentions that parole in the circumstances mentioned in the said
Rule can be granted in the discretion of the competent authority
if special circumstances exist for grant of parole. The ground
taken by the petitioner for grant of parole in the present case is
filing of SLP against the judgment of the High Court in Criminal
Appeal No. 391/2020 which was decided on 04.07.2022 whereby
the judgment of conviction dated 05.12.2019 and order on
sentence dated 19.12.2019 were upheld. It is the right of a citizen
to effectively pursue his legal remedy in the last court of justice in
the county by filing SLP through a counsel of his own choice
which is a valuable right. This cannot be withheld merely on the
basis of his past conduct or on the ground that free legal aid is
available and that SLP can be filed from the jail itself. Needless to
say, availing his legal remedy in the Apex Court of the country is
the right of the petitioner and this Court is not inclined to
withdraw the same.
10.    While passing this order, this Court also remains conscious
of the fact that the present accused/applicant has remained in
judicial custody since the day of arrest i.e. 11.05.2014 and is
continuously in the jail for around eight years and six months,
excluding remission.
11.     In this view of the matter, the present petition is allowed. The
petitioner is granted parole for a period of four weeks, subject to the
following conditions:-
i. The petitioner shall furnish a personal bond in the sum of
Rs.20,000/- with one surety of the like amount, who shall
be a family member of the petitioner, to the satisfaction of
the trial court.
ii. The petitioner shall report to the SHO of the local area,
once a week on every Sunday at 10:00 AM and shall not
leave the National Capital Territory of Delhi during the
period of parole.
iii.  The petitioner shall furnish a telephone number to the Jail
Superintendent on which he can he contacted, if required.
After his release, he shall also inform his telephone number
to the SHO of the police station concerned.
iv. Immediately upon the expiry of period of parole, the
petitioner shall surrender before the Jail Superintendent.
v.   The petitioner shall furnish a copy of the SLP filed in the
Supreme Court to the Superintendent Jail at the time of
surrendering. A copy of the SLP shall also be placed on
record in court.
vi. The period of parole shall be counted from the day when
the petitioner is released from jail.
12.    In the above terms, the present writ petition alongwith pending
application stands disposed of.
13.    A copy of this order be sent by the Registry to the Jail
