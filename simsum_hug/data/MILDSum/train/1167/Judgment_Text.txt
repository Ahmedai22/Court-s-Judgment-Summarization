FAO 36/2021 & connected matters                                              Page 4 of 19
Court. Mr. Rakesh Tikkoo, ld. Senior Counsel, appearing on behalf of Mr.
Lokesh Bhardwaj, submits that Mr. Lokesh Bhardwaj is an advocate whose
family is also part of the baridaars of the Kalkaji Mandir. He submits that
he does not have a copy of the ld. Administrator’s report.

Unauthorized encroachment by the shopkeepers and removal of
encroachments and unauthorized construction
7.     Vide the last order, this Court had clearly held that none of the
shopkeepers, who are in illegal occupation of Mandir premises, can remain
in possession. The shopkeepers or their families also cannot reside in the
Mandir complex. The same is impermissible and is nothing but unauthorized
encroachment and trespass into the Mandir's premises. Accordingly, the
“14.       Accordingly, the ld. Administrator, with the
cooperation of the Delhi Police and the SDMC, is
permitted to take action for removal of all the
unauthorized encroachers including their residences
within the Kalkaji Mandir premises. For the said
purpose, if any of the shopkeepers and illegal residents
in the Mandir premises are entitled to alternate
accommodation, the DUSIB may consider their request
and provide alternate premises on humanitarian
grounds. However, it is made clear that the pendency
FAO 36/2021 & connected matters                                                 Page 5 of 19
of any application for alternate accommodation before
DUSIB shall not come in the way of the removal of
encroachers and trespassers from the Mandir
premises.”
8.     Today, Ms. Samapika Biswal, ld. Counsel appearing on behalf of the
ld. Administrator submits that the direction is being complied with and as a
result, encroachments by 31 shopkeepers have been already removed from
the Mandir premises.
9.     In respect of this issue, impleadment applications bearing CM Appl.
No. 43944/2021 has been filed by 68 shopkeepers who claim to be the
occupants of the shops at the Kalkaji Mandir premises. Mr. Nitin Jain, ld.
Counsel has tendered appearance on their behalf. Apart from this, Mr.
Deepak Diwan, ld. Counsel has also tendered appearance on behalf of 33
shopkeepers, and Mr. Shashi Bhushan, ld. Counsel, has appeared for 4
shopkeepers, who claim to have their shops within the Kalkaji Mandir

clients who are four shopkeepers, three of whom also have their families
residing in the Dharamshala which is within the premises of the Kalkaji
Mandir. He submits that insofar as three shopkeepers - namely Ms.
Saraswati, Mr. Vinod Kumar Sharma and Mr. Gyan Sunder Sharma are
concerned, they are in occupation of the said premises since 20 to 30 years.
He accordingly prays that, on humanitarian grounds, they may be given time
to vacate the occupation of the said premises. Insofar the fourth shopkeeper,
who he represents, namely Mr. Hemant Raj Bhasin is concerned, he is in
occupation of one shop only and does not reside in the premises.
FAO 36/2021 & connected matters                                               Page 6 of 19
11.    On a query as to whether his clients, who are currently in occupation
and even in residence of the Mandir premises, would be willing to give an
undertaking, within two days, as to vacate the Mandir premises, Mr. Jain, ld.
Counsel, representing the 68 shopkeepers and their families, who have filed
CM Appl. No. 43944/2021, submits that he would like to take instructions
from his clients in respect of the same. A similar request is made by Mr.
Deepak Diwan, ld. Counsel appearing for another 33 shopkeepers.
12.    Mr. Bhardwaj, ld. Counsel appearing for a few of the baridaars
submits that several of the shopkeepers against whom decrees have been
passed by Trial Court are not even allowing enforcement of the said decrees.
Most of the shopkeepers are also not paying any tehbazari.
13.    This Court is of the opinion that insofar as the shopkeepers who have
made their residences and are in unauthorised occupation of shops, are
concerned, all the residents of the shops and within the Mandir premises
including the Dharamshala have to be vacated. It is also made clear that for
vacation of the shops and of unauthorized occupants from the Mandir
premises, the ld. Administrator shall continue to take action as per the
previous orders of this Court, with effect from 10th December, 2021
onwards. In the meantime, insofar as the three shopkeepers namely- Ms.
Saraswati, Mr. Vinod Kumar Sharma and Mr. Gyan Sunder Sharma,
represented by Mr. Bhushan, are concerned, considering that Mr. Bhushan
has submitted that they are willing to give undertakings to the court that they
will vacate their residences in the Dharamshala premises, they are given
time till 25th December, 2021 to vacate the said premises and the spaces
unauthorizedly occupied in the Dharamshala. The undertaking to this effect
shall be presented to the Court on 9th December, 2021 at 2:30 P.M. for
FAO 36/2021 & connected matters                                                Page 7 of 19
further orders.
14.    Mr. Jain and Mr. Diwan to also seek instructions from their clients by
the said date, and file their undertakings, if agreeable, as to whether the said
shopkeepers are willing to vacate the said premises.
15.    This court intends to request the architect who was appointed vide
order dated 27th September 2021 - Mr. Gurmeet Singh Chauhan, to inspect
and survey the entire premises of the Kalkaji Mandir and suggest an
alternate place where shops can be temporarily be run till the final plan for
the re-development of the Mandir is approved by this Court. For the said
purpose, if the shopkeepers file their undertakings before this court, an
option could be given, on the basis of the highest bid which may be received
as per the public notice floated by the Administrator on 12 th November,
2021, to all the shopkeepers who have had their shops for a long period in
the Kalkaji Mandir premises to run shops, subject to payment of
tehbazari/licence fee in accordance with the terms and conditions
prescribed. If the shopkeepers file their undertakings to the effect that they
would not occupy or reside in the Mandir premises, in terms mentioned
above, this Court could consider their undertakings and pass directions in
respect thereof on the next date of hearing.
16.    Finally, insofar as the shopkeepers, whose unauthorised residences
within the Mandir premises are to be vacated, are concerned, they are
permitted to approach the Delhi Urban Shelter Improvement Board (DUSIB)
and DDA immediately, for alternate premises if they are eligible in
accordance with law. If DUSIB has a process of providing रै न बसेरा (Night
shelter) they are permitted to avail of the same in accordance with law as
FAO 36/2021 & connected matters                                                 Page 8 of 19
well. Insofar as the SDMC and the DDA are concerned, it is made clear that
all the encroachments and persons who are in the unauthorised occupation,
whether in the shops or residences, have to be removed from the Kalkaji
Mandir and requisite cooperation shall be extended by the officials
concerned, to the ld. Administrator for the said purpose.
17.    Vide the last order dated 15th November 2021, the following
directions were passed in respect of the Delhi Jal Board:
“28.       The ld. Administrator has informed the Court
that there are three Piyaos in the Mandir premises.
However, regular water is not being made available by
the Delhi Jal Board, or any of the baridaars, or even
the Shri Kalkaji Mandir Prabandhak Sudhar
29.        Accordingly, it is directed that the Delhi Jal
Board shall send a team to the Kalkaji Mandir day
after tomorrow, to inspect and to take immediate steps
for laying down a temporary pipeline for uninterrupted
supply of drinking water to the devotees in the Mandir,
as also for running water supply to the toilet
complexes.
30.        The official from the Delhi Jal Board- Mr.
Ashok Kumar, Executive Engineer, M-41, is also
directed to coordinate with the ld. Administrator for
the installation of filtration equipment to the Piyaos, so
that uninterrupted drinking water is available to the
devotees.
31.        In respect thereof, a status report shall be
filed by the Delhi Jal Board before this Court,
confirming the uninterrupted availability of potable
water, by the next date of hearing.”
18.    Pursuant to this order, a status report has been filed on behalf of the
FAO 36/2021 & connected matters                                                   Page 9 of 19
Delhi Jal Board, informing the court that two tenders and work orders are in
the process of being issued for laying of water lines and sewer lines.
19.    Ms. Bharti, ld. Counsel for the Delhi Jal Board submits that currently
the construction work in Delhi-NCR region is stopped, and as soon as the
same recommences the work in respect of the directions given in the last
order, would be undertaken and a further status report would be filed.
20.    Finally, insofar as the sewer lines which were laid pursuant to the
orders of the Supreme Court in SLP(C) No. 32452-453/ 2013 are concerned,
since those sewer lines are stated to be blocked and are not in a serviceable
condition, the same shall be cleaned and it shall be ensured by the Delhi Jal
Board that the said sewer lines are opened and are put into proper functional
use for the purpose of the Mandir.
Suits transferred and issues in respect thereof
21.    Vide order dated 27th September 2021, various suits pertaining to the
Kalkaji Mandir were transferred to be consolidated before this Court. All

Upon receipt, Registry to number the above mentioned cases in their
respective categories.
23.    Insofar as the category B cases are concerned, list all these cases on
9th December, 2021 at 2:30 PM. All issues concerning the shopkeepers,

25.    Finally, list the case mentioned in Category C on 22nd February,
26.    The present review application has been filed by Sh. Kush Bhardwaj,
ld. Counsel for Sh. Naval Bhardwaj, who is one of the baridaars at the
Kalkaji Mandir. The Review Applicant is described as the Petitioner in the
said application. It is firstly also clarified that Mr. Kush Bhardwaj, ld.
Counsel who is appearing, is himself a baridaar, who had made submissions
before this court which were recorded in the order dated 27th September,
27.    As per the submissions made today, the Review Applicant claims that
FAO 36/2021 & connected matters                                              Page 14 of 19
he belongs to Thulla Bahadur group and is one of the pujaris who has
inherited the right to conduct the puja sewa. The grounds that have been
urged for seeking review of the order dated 27th September 2021 are:
i. That the court has exceeded its jurisdiction by going into other
issues concerning the Mandir while entertaining the First Appeal
against the order of the Trial Court under Order 39 Rule 1 and 2.
ii. 700 pujaris who have stakes in the Kalkaji Mandir have not been
made parties in the present proceedings.
iii. It is not permissible for the Court to go beyond the pleadings
urged in the FAO.
iv. The earlier orders passed in respect of the Kalkaji Mandir dated
10th May 1877 in Suit No. 85/1877, by the Extra Assistant
Commissioner in Maharamnath Chela of Sawant Nath, Nihaag
Jogi v. Umrao @ Lalji and ors., as well as the settlement
agreement dated 15th July 1843, have not been considered by the
court.
28.    Mr. Bhardwaj relies upon the following judgments in support of the
i.      Bachhaj Nahar v. Nilima Mandal and Ors. AIR 2009 SC 110
ii.     Smt. Chander Kali Bail and ors. Jagdish Singh Thakur and
iii.    Dr. Subramanium Swamy v. State of Tamil Nadu and Ors.
iv.     Sri Channakeshwavaswamy Temple and Anr. v. The
Commissioner for Hindu Religious and Endowments

Court of Karnataka, decided on 20th May 2020)
29.    It is submitted by the other members of the Thulla Bahadur, who are
represented in this court by Mr. Nagpal and Ms, Mann, that they do not
concur with the submissions being made by Mr. Kush Bhardwaj, ld.
30.    This Court has perused the Review application, and has also perused
the judgments which have been placed by ld. Counsel for the Applicant. As
contained in the order dated 27th September, 2021 and the previous orders
passed therein, Shree Kalkaji Mandir is a Mandir of great historical
importance to Delhi, and has been a subject matter of at least 60 to 70
proceedings which were pending before various district courts and several
courts in Delhi. As per order dated 27th September 2021, all these cases have
now been transferred to this Court in exercise of powers under Section 24
31.    In FAO 36/2021, the issues raised are in respect of the rights of
women to conduct puja sewa, as also the manner in which the offerings,
donations, etc are to be collected by the various baridaars at the Kalkaji
Mandir. A decision on this issue would have a significant impact on all the
proceedings which were pending in various district courts. Accordingly, this
Court, exercising its powers under Section 24 of CPC, had vide order dated
27th September 2021, directed transfer all matters pending before the lower
courts, in respect of the Kalkaji Mandir, before this court, to hear all parties
who are stakeholders in the Kalkaji Mandir, consolidate the issues and
resolve them in a quick and efficient manner.
32.    The issues raised in FAO 36/2021 which are being dealt with by the
court, are issues with ramifications spanning across the various stakeholders
FAO 36/2021 & connected matters                                              Page 16 of 19
in the Mandir. Thus, this court holds that the ground for review that this
court has exceeded its jurisdiction is completely untenable. In any case, the
order dated 27th September 2021, is not only in the context of the FAO, but
has also been passed exercising jurisdiction under Articles 226 and 227 of
the Constitution of India in CM(M) 323/2021.
33.    Insofar as hearing being given to all the pujaris of the Mandir are
concerned, as recorded in the judgment dated 27th September, 2021, there
are various groups which are conducting puja sewa and collecting the
donations and offerings in the Mandir. All these groups were clearly
represented before this court by various Counsels, whose submissions have
been recorded from time to time during the hearings, as reflected in the
order dated 27th September 2021.
34.    In matters of this nature, where each and every group has hundreds of
individual stakeholders, it is practically impossible to hear each and every
pujari or each and every member of their family. Broadly all the groups and
baridaars have been heard on several dates prior to the passing of order
dated 27th September 2021, including Mr. Kush Bhardwaj and his client Mr.
Naval Bhardwaj, whose submissions were clearly recorded in the said order.
35.    Insofar as the earlier orders relating to Suit No. 85/1877, and
Settlement Agreement of 1843 are concerned, all these orders were
considered in the judgment passed by the ld. Sub- Judge, Delhi dated 1st
February, 1974, where the shares of the various groups were decided. This
order of the ld. Sub-Judge, dated 1st February 1974, has been fully
considered by this court in its order dated 27th September, 2021. In any
event, it is made clear that before finally disposing of these matters, all the
requisite orders historically passed by various forums in respect of the

Kalkaji Mandir would be considered by this Court.
36.    Finally, insofar as the submission of Mr. Bhardwaj that the
appointment of an Administrator can be only for a limited period is
concerned, the gross mismanagement that was happening in the Mandir and
the complete unauthorized encroachment and the whimsical manner in
which the tehbazari were being given had created a matter of immense
concern, especially, in light of the fact that hundreds and thousands of
devotees visit the Mandir every day. Moreover, there is no unity among the
various baridaars. Each group has various sub-groups and all individuals
speak in different voices. There is enormous in-fighting amongst the
stakeholders which is reflected in various proceedings that were pending in
different courts. Some cases have been filed for each and every bari and the
said baris are being auctioned, on a commercial basis. The spiritual sanctity
of the Mandir is completely eroded by all the stakeholders, unauthorised
occupants, encroachments by shopkeepers, lack of cleanliness and hygiene,
lack of basic amenities to devotees. It was under these circumstances that
before this Court, the baridaars, as noted in the order dated 27th September
2021, clearly arrived at a consensus that there was a need to appoint an
Administrator to look after the administration of the Kalkaji Mandir.
37.    It is under these circumstances that this Court has appointed a Retired
Judge as the ld. Administrator vide order dated 27 th September 2021. The
Administrator would, hopefully not be required to act for an indefinite
period. However, he would have to render his assistance until the
encroachments and unauthorized constructions have been removed, the
process of collection of donations and offerings are streamlined, and some
broad progress takes place in respect of the redevelopment of the Mandir as

also the provision of civic amenities for the devotees.
38.    Accordingly, the Applicant has failed to demonstrate any grounds of
review and the review application is clearly devoid of any merit.
39.    Review application is accordingly dismissed with no order as to costs.
