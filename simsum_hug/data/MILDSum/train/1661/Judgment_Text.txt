This  Criminal   Original    Petition     is     directed
against the order passed in Cr.M.P.No.1935 of 2021,
dated 21.10.2021 on the file of the learned Principal
Sessions Judge for EC and NDPS Act cases, Madurai,
dismissing the petition filed under Section 167(2) of
Code of Civil Procedure, seeking statutory bail.
2.The respondent police has registered a case in
Crime         No.156   of  2021   against  the    petitioner          for
allegedly          possessing   of   22  kgs   of    Ganga,       under
Sections 8(c) r/w 20(b) (ii) (c) of NDPS Act.
3.It is not in dispute that the petitioner was
arrested on 19.04.2021 and was remanded to judicial
custody on 20.04.2021. The petitioner has filed a
petition under Section 167(2) Cr.P.C, seeking default
bail alleging that the respondent police has failed
to file the charge sheet within a period of 180 days
envisaged          under  Section    36(A)  of   NDPS       Act.      The
petitioner has filed the said petition for statutory
bail         on  18.10.2021.  Admittedly    the   respondent          has
CRL OP(MD). No.18273 of 2021
also filed the charge sheet on 18.10.2021. As evident
from the order of the learned trial Judge, petition
filed         under    Section   167(2)   Cr.P.C,     was     returned,
directing           the   counsel   on   record   to    produce         the
relevant decisions, in view of the judgment of this
Court passed in Crl.OP(MD)Nos.5104, 5843, 10854 and
10902 of 2021.
4.It is further evident that the petition was
re-presented           and   the  same   was   taken     on    file       on
20.10.2021. The learned trial Judge, after hearing
both the learned counsel for the petitioner as well
the learned Special Public Prosecutor appearing for
the respondent, has passed the impugned order dated
21.10.2021, dismissing the said petition. Aggrieved
by        the    order   of  dismissal,    the  accused       has     come
forward with the present petition.
5.At   the  outset,   as   rightly  contended        by     the
learned counsel for the petitioner, the trial Court
in its order has dealt with the merits of the case
and came to the conclusion that the petitioner cannot
be enlarged on statutory bail. It is necessary to
CRL OP(MD). No.18273 of 2021
refer the relevant paragraph of the order passed by
the trial Court here under :
“Considering   the   seriousness,     gravity       of     the
offence, serious objections on prosecution side and
huge quantity of the contraband, this Court is not
inclined to grant statutory bail to the petitioner
and          therefore,   this    petition    is   liable        to      be
dismissed.”
6.The   Bail     Court,    while     considering           the
application          under   Section   167(2)    Cr.P.C,      is     duty
bound to decide the application forthwith without any
unnecessary            delay,      after     getting         necessary
information from the concerned Public Prosecutor and
to consider as to whether the ingredients necessary
for          releasing   the   accused   on    default      bail       are
existing and that if the Court is satisfied with the
existence of such ingredients, then the Court has to
release the accused on bail forthwith.
7.Moreover, the Bail Court, while dealing with
the petition for statutory bail, is having no power
or jurisdiction to go into the merits of the case and
CRL OP(MD). No.18273 of 2021
to see as to whether the ingredients necessary for
granting regular bail are available or not.
8.In the case on hand, as already pointed out,
the          learned    trial    Judge   after     receiving          the
application          on    18.10.2021,   returned    the     petition
twice and took the petition on file on 20.10.2021 and
thereafter, had proceeded to discuss about the merits
of         the   case   and   at   last,   concluded       that       the
petitioner is not entitled to get statutory bail.
9.The learned counsel for the petitioner would
submit         that   whether   the   accused   is   entitled         for
statutory bail, when the charge sheet is filed after
filing         of  the   bail  application,    has   already        been
answered by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case in
M.Ravindran Vs. State of Tamil Nadu reported in 2021
1 SCC (Cri) 876, that though the respondent Police
has filed the charge sheet on 18.10.2021 itself, the
trial Court has failed to ascertain the time as to
when the charge sheet was filed into the Court and
that the trial Court without ascertaining the time,
by         simply   observing    that   the   final    report         was
CRL OP(MD). No.18273 of 2021
prepared and kept ready on 31.08.2021 itself and the
same was filed on 18.10.2021, has decided against the
petitioner.
10.The   learned   Additional   Public      Prosecutor
appearing for the respondent would submit that the
respondent has filed the charge sheet at about 10.30
am on 18.10.2021 before the E-filing counter attached
to the Madurai District Court, that due to Dassara
Holidays           from   14.10.2021    to    17.10.2021,            the
prosecution with no other option has laid the charge
sheet on 18.10.2021 i.e., immediately on the next
working day and that the learned trial Judge, after
taking into all the aspects, has rightly dismissed
the petition.
11.In  the  case  on  hand,   two  questions/issues
(i) Whether the indefeasible right accrued to
the petitioner/accused under Section 167(2) Cr.P.C
can be defeated by filing charge sheet simultaneously
or subsequently on the same day, by the prosecution?
CRL OP(MD). No.18273 of 2021
(ii)  Whether    the  provisions    of   Section       10     of
General Clauses Act can be invoked, while computing
the period of 60 days or 90 days as envisaged by
Section 167(2) Cr.P.C or 180 days as envisaged by
Section 36(A) (4) of NDPS Act r/w Section 167(2)
12.Before entering into further discussion, it
is necessary to refer Section 167(2) Cr.P.C and the
corresponding Section 36(A) (4) of NDPS Act;
“The   Magistrate    to    whom    an    accused
person is forwarded under this section may,
whether he has or has not jurisdiction to try
the case, from time to time, authorise the
detention of the accused in such custody as
such Magistrate thinks fit, for a term not
exceeding fifteen days in the whole; and if
he has no jurisdiction to try the case or
commit it for trial, and considers further
detention      unnecessary,    he    may    order       the
accused     to   be   forwarded    to   a   Magistrate
having such jurisdiction.”
(a) the Magistrate may authorise the
detention     of    the    accused      person,
CRL OP(MD). No.18273 of 2021
otherwise   than   in    the   custody     of   the
police,   beyond    the   period     of   fifteen
days; if he is satisfied that adequate
grounds   exist    for    doing    so,    but      no
Magistrate shall authorise the detention
of the accused person in custody under
this   paragraph     for     a    total     period
investigation relates to an offence
punishable with death, imprisonment
for life or imprisonment for a term
investigation relates to any other
offence, and, on the expiry of the
said period of ninety days, or sixty
days,   as   the    case     may   be,     the
accused person shall be released on
bail if he is prepared to and does
furnish    bail,     and     every    person
released   on   bail    under    this    sub-
section   shall   be   deemed    to    be   so
released    under    the    provisions      of
Chapter XXXIII for the purposes of
(b)no    Magistrate       shall      authorise
detention   in    any    custody     under     this
section unless the accused is produced
CRL OP(MD). No.18273 of 2021
(c)   no   Magistrate    of   the    Second
class, not specifically empowered in this
behalf by the High Court, shall authorise
detention in the custody of the police”
Section 36(A) (4) of NDPS Act :
“(4) In respect of persons accused of an
offence      punishable     under   section      19      or
section 24 or section 27 A or for offences
involving commercial quantity the references
in sub-section (2) of section 167 of the Code
of    Criminal    Procedure,    1973   (2   of    1974),
thereof to "ninety days", where they occur,
shall     be   construed    as   reference     to     "one
Provided     that,    if  it   is  not   possible        to
complete     the   investigation    within    the     said
period of one hundred and eighty days, the
Special Court may extend the said period up
to    one   year   on  the   report   of   the    Public
Prosecutor      indicating    the  progress     of      the
investigation      and   the  specific    reasons       for
the detention of the accused beyond the said
period of one hundred and eighty days.”
13.Section 167(2) Cr.P.C., contemplates that if
the charge sheet is not laid within the period of 60
days or 90 days as the case may be, the accused is
CRL OP(MD). No.18273 of 2021
entitled to get default bail. Section 36(A) (4) of
NDPS          Act  prescribes a  period   of   180     days       for
investigating         certain offences  under   the     NDPS      Act
instead of 90 days as provided under Section 167(2)
14.The proviso to Section 36(A)(4) of NDPS Act
permits the Special Court to extend the time from 180
days upto one year, if the Public Prosecutor submits
a report indicating the progress of investigation and
giving specific reasons for requiring the detention
of the accused beyond the prescribed period of 180
days.
15.There is a misconception that in cases where
the bail petition under Section 167(2) Cr.P.C and the
charge sheet are being filed on the same day, then
the time at which, bail petition or the charge sheet
is filed, is the deciding factor and that if the
charge sheet is filed earlier to the bail petition,
then the accused is not entitled to get the statutory
bail or in case, if the bail petition is filed before
laying of charge sheet, then the bail application has
CRL OP(MD). No.18273 of 2021
to be allowed. The accused is entitled to file his
application for default bail only after the expiry of
60 days or 90 days or 180 days as the case may be and
that his right to avail the statutory bail accures
only on the next day i.e., on 61st, 91st or 181st day,
as the case may be, but the investigating agency has
to file the charge sheet before the expiry of 60
days, 90 days or 180 days as the case may be, if they
require          the   detention   of   the   accused     beyond        the
prescribed period of 60 or 90 or 180 days.
16.The   Hon'ble   Supreme    Court   in   Rakesh       Kumar
Paul Vs. State of Assam reported in (2017) 15 SCC 67,
has held that, “as a cautionary measure, the counsel
for the accused as well as the Magistrate ought to
inform          the   accused   of    the   availability         of     the
indefeasible           right   under   Section    167(2)       once       it
accrues to him, without any delay. This is especially
where the accused is from an underprivileged section
of         society    and   is   unlikely    to   have     access         to
information about his legal rights. Such knowledge-
sharing          by   Magistrates    will   thwart     any     dilatory
tactics by the prosecution and also ensure that the
CRL OP(MD). No.18273 of 2021
obligations          spelled   out   under Article     21     of     the
Constitution and the statement of objects and Reasons
of the Cr.P.C are upheld.”
17.If the charge sheet is filed on 61st or 91st or
181st day, as the case may be, even prior to the
filing of the bail petition on the same day, the said
filing of the charge sheet will not defeat the right
already         accrued   to   the   accused  and    if     such       an
interpretation is not given, then that will lead to a
proposition that the investigating agency can file a
charge sheet even on 61st or 91st or 181st day as the
case may be, as of right and detain the accused in
judicial custody.
18.  Let   us   visualize    a  situation.        If     the
prosecution files charge sheet in the morning session
on 61st or 91st or 181st day, as the case may be,
before the Registry or E-filing Section of that Court
concerned, then the accused is produced before the
concerned          Court   in    the   afternoon    session          for
extension of remand and if the Magistrate informs
about his right to apply for statutory bail as per
CRL OP(MD). No.18273 of 2021
directions of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Rakesh
Kumar Paul's case and the accused files a petition
for bail under Section 167(2) Cr.P.C, can it be said
that since the prosecution has filed the charge sheet
earlier         to  the  filing  of  the  bail    petition,         the
indefeasible           right    to   statutory       bail         gets
19.A Full Bench of the Hon'ble Apex Court in
M.Ravindran Vs. The Intelligence Officer, Director of
Revenue         Intelligence  reported   in 2021     2    SCC     485,
“14.2 It must also be added and it is
well settled that issuance of notice to
the State on the application for default
bail filed under the Proviso to Section
167(2)    is   only    so   that    the       Public
Prosecutor can satisfy the Court that the
prosecution has already obtained an order
of extension of time from the Court; or
that   the challan    has been   filed in          the
designated Court before the expiry of the
prescribed period; or that the prescribed
period    has   actually   not   expired.          The
prosecution can accordingly urge the Court
CRL OP(MD). No.18273 of 2021
to  refuse   granting   bail   on   the     alleged
ground of default. Such issuance of notice
would avoid the possibility of the accused
obtaining   default   bail  by   deliberate           or
inadvertent    suppression of    certain facts
and   also  guard   against   multiplicity            of
proceedings.”(emphasis supplied)
20.In the same judgement, the Hon'ble Supreme
Court after referring its earlier judgements in
(i) Dr. Bipin Shantilal Panchal vs State Of
Maharashtra (1996) 1 SCC 722; and
(iii)  Sanjay   Dutt  vs  State    Through         C.B.I.
(1994) 5 SCC 410; has held that the accused must
apply for default bail the moment the right under
Section          167(2)   Cr.P.C  accrues    to    him      and     the
relevant passages are extracted hereunder:
15.1    Similarly,      in     Dr.         Bipin
Shantilal     Panchal    (supra),       it        was
admitted that the accused had not filed
an application for bail at the time the
right   under   Section   167(2),      CrPC       had
CRL OP(MD). No.18273 of 2021
accrued    to   him.    The    chargesheet          had
already    been   filed    by    the     time       the
accused   sought   to   avail    of   his     right.
Incidentally, the same three Judge Bench
which   had    delivered     the     opinion          in
Mohamed Iqbal Madar Sheikh (supra), and
which    was     part     of     the       original
Constitution      Bench     in     Sanjay         Dutt
(supra), rendered judgment as follows:
“4…But it is an admitted position
that   the   charge   sheet     has    been
filed   on   23-5-1994    and    now    the
appellant    is  in   custody      on   the
basis of orders of remand passed
under the other provisions of the
Code. Whether the accused who was
entitled to be released on bail
under proviso to sub section (2)
of Section 167 of the Code, not
having    made  an   application       when
such    right    had     accrued,       can
exercise    that   right    at   a   later
stage of the proceeding, has been
examined by a Constitution Bench
Sanjay Dutt v. State through CBI…
…Therefore, if an accused person
fails to exercise his right to be
CRL OP(MD). No.18273 of 2021
released on bail for the failure
of    the   prosecution      to   file    the
charge     sheet   within     the   maximum
time    allowed     by   law,    he   cannot
indefeasible right to exercise it
at    any   time   notwithstanding        the
fact     that   in    the    meantime     the
charge sheet is filed. But on the
other     hand   if   he    exercises     the
right within the time allowed by
law and is released on bail under
such circumstances, he cannot be
rearrested on the mere filing of
the charge sheet, as pointed out
in Aslam Babalal Desai v. State
of        Maharashtra.”           (emphasis
The      above      mentioned        discussion
clearly    corroborates      our   view,     and      the
view    taken    by   the     majority      in      Uday
Mohanlal    Acharya,     that    the   decision         in
Sanjay     Dutt     only     lays     down       as       a
precautionary principle that the accused
must apply for default bail the moment
the right under Section 167(2) accrues to
him.   If   he   fails    to   do   so,   he    cannot
CRL OP(MD). No.18273 of 2021
claim the right at a subsequent stage of
the proceedings after the prosecution has
filed a charge sheet.
The words “not having made an application
when such right had accrued, can exercise
that  right  at  a  later    stage”     clearly
indicate that the accused is deemed to
have exercised his right to bail once he
makes an application for the same.”
21.In  Bikramjit  Singh   Vs.  State     of      Punjab
reported in 2020 SCC Online SC 824, the Hon'ble
Apex Court has observed thus :
“A conspectus of the aforesaid decisions
would show that so long as an application
for   grant  of  default   bail   is    made       on
expiry of the period of 90 days (which
application need not even be in writing)
before a charge sheet is filed, the right
to default bail becomes complete. It is of
no   moment  that  the    Criminal    Court        in
question either does not dispose of such
application   before  the   charge     sheet       is
filed   or  disposes   of   such   application
wrongly before such charge sheet is filed.
So long as an application has been made
CRL OP(MD). No.18273 of 2021
for default bail on expiry of the stated
period before time is further extended to
the maximum period of 180 days, default
bail, being an indefeasible right of the
accused under the first proviso to Section
167(2), kicks in and must be granted.”
22.In M.Ravindran's case, the Hon'ble Apex Court
has         held  that    in   case   of  any  ambiguity        in     the
construction          of   a   penal   statue,  the    Courts        must
favour          the    interpretation     which    leans        towards
protecting          the   rights    of  the  accused,      given       the
ubiquitous          power   disparity    between   the    individual
accused         and   the   State   machinery  and    the      same      is
applicable not only in the case of substantive penal
statutes but also in the case of procedures providing
for the curtailment of the liberty of the accused.
23.It is pertinent to mention that the Hon'ble
Supreme Court in              M.Ravindran's case, cited supra,
has held that the Constitution Bench decision in
Sanjay Dutt's case cannot be interpreted so as to
mean that even where the accused has promptly
CRL OP(MD). No.18273 of 2021
exercised           his   right   under    Section      167(2)        and
indicated his willingness to furnish bail, he can
be denied bail on account of delay in deciding
his          application    or  erroneous     rejection         of    the
same. Nor can he be kept detained in custody on
account           of   subterfuge    of   the    prosecution             in
filing a police report or additional complaint on
the same day that the bail application is filed.
24.Considering the above, the moot point that
arises is as to what is the time available for the
accused to apply statutory bail, after the expiry of
the period prescribed for filing the final report by
the investigating agency.
25.As   already  pointed    out,   the    investigating
agency         is   duty  bound  to   file   their    final       report
before expiry of 60 or 90 or 180 days, as the case
may be, and on the next day i.e, 61st or 91st or 181st
day only, the right to apply for statutory bail gets
accrued          to   the  accused  and    there    must      be     some
reasonable time limit enabling him to apply for the
CRL OP(MD). No.18273 of 2021
default bail. In Tamil Nadu, all the Courts shall
ordinarily         sit   at  10.30.am.  If  the    investigating
agency files the charge sheet by 10.30 am, on the
next day, after the expiry of the period prescribed
under Section 167(2) Cr.P.C, can we say that the
accused has lost his right of filing the petition for
default bail subsequently, on the same day. In my
considered view, the accused can exercise his right
to apply the default bail on the whoe day, on which,
the indefeasible right to apply the statutory bail
accrues to him.
26.In the case on hand, admittedly both the bail
petition as well as the charge sheet were filed on
18.10.2021.         As   rightly  contended    by    the     learned
counsel for the petitioner, the period of 180 days
got         expired  before   18.10.2021   and    as   such,        the
respondent police has failed to file the charge sheet
within the prescribed period of 180 days. But on the
other         hand,  the   petitioner  only  after      expiry        of
prescribed period of 180 days has filed the petition
by        invoking   his   indefeasible  right    under      Section
36(A)(4) of NDPS Act r/w Section 167(2) of Cr.P.C.
CRL OP(MD). No.18273 of 2021
Hence, the observation of the learned trial Judge
that she had verified with the concerned staffs of
E-filing Section as to the time, at which the charge
sheet was filed and that since the concerned staffs
had informed that there was no practice to enter the
time          at  which,  the  petitions  or   cases     are     being
filed,           pales    into   insignificance.      Since          the
prosecution has laid the charge sheet, after expiry
of period prescribed, the time of filing the charge
sheet cannot be considered as a relevant criteria for
deciding the statutory bail.
27.The   Hon'ble  Supreme  Court  in    M.Ravindran's
case, cited supra, while considering the points as to
whether          the   indefeasible   right  accruing         to     the
accused under Section 167(2) Cr.P.C gets extinguished
by subsequent filing of an additional complaint by
the         investigating    agency,  after  referring        to     the
various decisions on the subject, has concluded as
“18. Therefore, in conclusion:
18.1   Once    the   accused     files         an
application for bail under the Proviso to
CRL OP(MD). No.18273 of 2021
Section    167(2)     he    is   deemed      to      have
‘availed of’ or enforced his right to be
released on default bail, accruing after
expiry of the stipulated time limit for
investigation.       Thus,      if     the     accused
applies       for      bail      under         Section
167(2)Cr.P.C read with Section 36 A, NDPS
Act   upon    expiry     of    180    days     or      the
extended period, as the case may be, the
Court must release him on bail forthwith
without     any    unnecessary         delay       after
getting   necessary       information       from       the
public   prosecutor,       as   mentioned        supra.
Such   prompt     action      will    restrict         the
prosecution        from        frustrating             the
legislative       mandate      to     release          the
accused on bail in case of default by the
investigative agency.
18.2   The    right     to   be    released        on
default      bail      continues        to       remain
enforceable     if   the   accused      has    applied
for such     bail, notwithstanding           pendency
of  the   bail    application;       or   subsequent
filing of the charge sheet or a report
seeking     extension        of    time       by       the
prosecution before the Court; or filing
of    the      charge      sheet       during          the
interregnum       when      challenge        to        the
CRL OP(MD). No.18273 of 2021
rejection     of   the  bail  application           is
pending before a higher Court.
18.3 However, where the accused fails
to apply for default bail when the right
accrues to him, and subsequently a charge
sheet, additional complaint or a report
seeking   extension    of  time  is    preferred
before    the    Magistrate,   the    right        to
default bail would be extinguished. The
Magistrate would be at liberty to take
cognizance of the case or grant further
time for completion of the investigation,
as the case may be, though the accused
may still be released on bail under other
provisions of the Cr.P.C.
18.4   Notwithstanding     the    order       of
default    bail   passed   by  the   Court,        by
virtue    of    Explanation   I    to     Section
167(2), the actual release of the accused
from    custody     is   contingent      on       the
directions passed by the competent Court
granting bail. If the accused fails to
furnish bail and/or comply with the terms
and conditions of the bail order within
the   time   stipulated   by  the   Court,        his
continued detention in custody is valid.”
CRL OP(MD). No.18273 of 2021
28.Considering    the   above,  this     Court      has      no
hesitation          to   hold  that   since  the   petitioner          has
availed          of   his   indefeasible    right     to      bail       on
18.10.2021 and offered to abide by the terms and
conditions          to   be  imposed,   the  subsequent        or    even
simultaneous           filing  of   the  charge   sheet      does      not
disentitle the petitioner from claiming the default
bail.
29.As already pointed out, the next contention
of the prosecution is that since the Courts were
closed for Dassara Holidays for the period between
14.10.2021 and 17.10.2021, the charge sheet has been
laid on the very next working day i.e., on 18.10.2021
and as per Section 10 of the General Clauses Act, the
prosecution is certainly entitled to file the charge
sheet on the next working day, since the date on
which, the period prescribed for filing the charge
sheet expires on a holiday. Hence, it is necessary to
refer Section 10 of the General Clauses Act.
CRL OP(MD). No.18273 of 2021
Section 10 the General Clauses Act of
Where,    by    any   Central       Act        or
Regulation   made    after  the   commencement
of this Act, any act or proceeding is
directed or allowed to be done or taken
in any Court or office on a certain day
or within a prescribed period, then, if
the Court or office is closed on that
day or the last day of the prescribed
period, the act or proceeding shall be
considered as done or taken in due time
if it is done or taken on the next day
afterwards on which the Court or office
Provided     that    nothing      in       this
section    shall   apply    to   any      act       or
proceeding      to     which     the        Indian
Limitation    Act,    1877    (XVI    of      1877)
applies.”
30.Section   10   of   the   General      Clauses         Act
contemplates         that   a  person  for   whom    a    period        is
prescribed for the performance of an act in a Court
or Office, and that the period expires on a holiday,
CRL OP(MD). No.18273 of 2021
then the person is entitled to do the said act on the
next working day.
31.An interesting question arise as to whether
Section 10 of General Clauses Act is applicable to
the investigating agency for filing the charge sheet,
if        the    period  contemplated   under    Section        167(2)
Cr.P.C expires on a holiday.
32.A single Judge of Bombay High Court in State
Of Maharashtra vs Sharad B. Sarda                     reported in
1983 (1) BomCR 578, has discussed the above point
elaborately and came to the conclusion that Section
10 of General Clauses Act has no application in such
cases          and   the  relevant   passages     are      extracted
“13. The point to be decided, is as
to whether the provisions of section 10
of   the General   Clauses Act,       1897 are
attracted   by the    facts of     this case.
Mr. Hudlikar contended that 90 the day
of   detention of   the accused       falls on
Sunday i.e. on September 12, 1982, so
on   the  next  opening   of  the     courts        a
CRL OP(MD). No.18273 of 2021
charged sheet is filed on September 13,
1982   and    therefore,     the   proceeding
shall be considered as done or taken in
due time, on the next day after wards
on which the Court is opened. Section
10  of  General    Clauses    Act   lays      down
that   whereby      any   Central      Act        or
regulation made after the commencement
of this act, any act or proceedings is
directed or allowed to be done or taken
in any Court or office on a certain day
or  within a    prescribe period       then if
the Court or office is closed on that
day or the last day of the prescribed
period the Act or the proceeding shall
be considered as done or taken in due
time. According to Mr. Hudlikar, filing
of  the charge     sheet on    September 13,
1982 on opening of the Court on that
day  was   saved    by  section   10     of     the
General   Clauses Act.     It is    true that
the Court was closed on September 1982.
The question is as to whether under the
Code any time has been prescribed for
filing of a charge-sheet. Mr. Hudlikar
fairly    conceded     that   there      is       no
prescribed period mentioned in the Code
to   file   a    charge    sheet.     What        is
CRL OP(MD). No.18273 of 2021
required     under     section      10     of      the
General Clauses Act is that any act or
proceeding     directed    or    allowed     to      be
done or taken in any Court on a certain
day   or  within     prescribed     period       then
the   Act   or   the   proceedings       shall       be
considered as done or taken in due time
if it is done or taken on the next day
afterwards      on    which     the    Court         is
opened. As stated above no certain day
was fixed by the order of the Court or
any period prescribed for filing of the
charge-sheet.       The    prosecution         could
have   filed    the    charge     sheet     earlier
than September 12, 1982. Except filing
of  the   charge-sheet       on   September        13,
1982 nothing has been done as directed
or   allowed     to   be   done     and    it      is,
therefore,      that     the     provisions          of
section 10 of the General Clauses Act
will    not    apply.     An    absolute       right
accrued to the accused on the expiry of
90 days and it cannot be defeated by
merely   filing     of  the    charge-sheet          on
September 13, 1982. The right is
State Of Maharashtra vs Sharad B. Sarda
on 29 November, 1982 accrued the moment
90 days are over, whether that 90th day
CRL OP(MD). No.18273 of 2021
falls on a holiday or not. The accused
continued     to    be    in    custody          and
therefore,    the   provisions     of     section
167(2) lays down that he can be in the
custody only for a period of 90 days or
60 days, as the case may be. As stated
above   the    right   is   accrued      to      the
accused   and    it  is   the   duty     of      the
Magistrate to inform the accused that
he is entitled to be released on bail
and this absolute right of the accused
cannot   be   allowed   to   be   defeated         by
resorting to the provisions of section
10 of the General Clauses Act. Thus, in
this view of the matter it must be held
that section 10 of the General Clauses
Act does not apply to this case.”
33.But subsequently, a Division Bench of Orissa
High Court in N.Sureya Reddy and another Vs. State of
Orissa reported in 1985 (1) OLR 105, has held that
section 10 of the General Clauses Act can be invoked
by investigating agency for the purpose of laying the
final         reports.   Subsequently,   a   Division       Bench       of
Delhi high Court in Powell Nwawa Ogechi vs. The State
(Delhi         Administration)   reported   in   ILR    1986      Delhi
CRL OP(MD). No.18273 of 2021
181, after referring the decisions of the Bombay and
Orissa High Courts, has agreed with the view taken by
the Bombay High Court and the relevant passages are
“(11) A bare reading of the aforesaid
provision of the Code would go to show that
this provision merely confers power on the
Magistrate to commit to custody an accused
person and there is limitation of 90 days
and  60  days,   as   the   case   may    be.     This
provision of the Code falls under Chap. XII
of the Code relating to information to the
police and their powers to investigate. It
is thus clear that this is a power which is
only   exercisable    during     the    course        of
investigation    of   a   case.   The     power       to
commit an accused person to custody after
investigation is over and after the charge-
sheet  is   presented    before   the    Court,       is
derived   from  Section     309,   Cr.    P.C.      Any
further remand to judicial custody beyond
90  days  and  60   days   without    the    charge-
sheet being presented before the Court will
be without the authority of law.
(12) Sub-section (2) of Section 167 of the
Code  nowhere   prescribes     a   period     within
which  the   police   is   required    to    present
CRL OP(MD). No.18273 of 2021
charge-sheet before the court nor does it
envisage the performance of an act by an
accused person within a particular period
before a Court or office. In fact, nowhere
in  the  Code   a   period    is   prescribed        for
investigation    to   produce    the   charge-sheet
before    a   Court      of    law.     Since        the
Legislature     in     its     wisdom      has       not
prescribed    a   period      within     which       the
investigation    has   to   present    charge-sheet
against an accused person before a Court,
it would be wrong to say that the provision
of Section 167(2) of Code had prescribed
the    limit     by     implication.        If       the
Legislature had aimed it to be so, there
was nothing to prevent it from saying so
explicitly.   By    invoking     the   doctrine        of
implication we will be importing something
in the provision which the Legislature has
deliberately refrained to do. It will not
only  have   the    effect    of   distorting        the
provision    but     will     also     defeat        the
legislative intent.
(13) In N. Sureya Reddy's case (1985 Cri LJ
939)  (supra)   a   Division     Bench    of   Orissa
High Court has ruled that Section 10 of the
General  Clauses     Act   is   attracted     if     the
charge-sheet    against     the    accused     person
could not be presented on the 60th or 90th
CRL OP(MD). No.18273 of 2021
day   for   the    reason     of   being    a   public
holiday and this is so ruled on the ground
that   by  implication       Section    167(2)      does
prescribe    a    period    for    presentation         of
charge-sheet      before     a   Court.      We     have
carefully   considered      this    proposition       but
we   respectfully      do   not    agree    with      the
aforesaid    view     for    the    reasons     stated
above.
(14)A    contrary      view    to    the    aforesaid
authority, with which we agree, has been
taken by the High Court of Bombay in State
of Maharashtra v. Sharad B. Sarda (1983 (2)
Cri LC 18) wherein it was held that in a
case   such    as   this,     Section    10    of     the
General Clauses Act has no application as
the Code does not prescribe any time limit
for   presentation      of   charge-sheet      by     the
investigation.      The   learned     Judge    further
ruled that after the expiry of time of 90
or  60   days,     the   right    accruing     to     the
accused is absolute. One of our own Judges
in   Criminal     Misc.    (Main)    504    of     1985,
Bhagwat Singh v. State, has had an occasion
to    consider     the     proposition      regarding
application      of    Section     10   of     General
Clauses Act and has opined that it has no
application     and   the   accused    person      after
the expiry of 90 days or 60 days as the
case may be, is entitled to be released on
CRL OP(MD). No.18273 of 2021
bail. We are in respectful agreement with
the view taken in the aforesaid cases i.e.
by the learned Judge of Bombay High Court
and by the learned Judge of our own High
34.As rightly observed by the Delhi High Court,
Section 10 of General Clauses Act presupposes that
there must be a positive act to be performed, in
existence and for the performance of which, there is
in existence a period prescribed by law.
35. It is pertinent to mention that the Code of
Criminal Procedure does not prescribe any particular
period for laying the charge sheet and the Section
167(2) of Cr.P.C does not prescribe any period of
limitation          even  by  implication.  The    investigating
agency          is  certainly  entitled  to  file     the      charge
sheet, even after expiry of 60 or 90 or 180 days, as
the case may be, but they will not have any right to
seek extension of remand beyond the period prescribed
under Section 167(2) Cr.P.C.
CRL OP(MD). No.18273 of 2021
36.Considering the judgements of Delhi, Orissa
and         Bombay   High  Courts and  the   reasonings         given
therein, this Court is in entire agreement with the
view expressed by the Bombay High Court, which was
accepted by the Delhi High Court. Hence, this Court
has no hesitation to hold that Section 10 of the
General Clauses Act has no application at all and the
same cannot be invoked by the investigating agency
for laying the final report, after the expiry of the
prescribed period.
37.The Hon'ble Supreme Court, after taking suo
motu cognizance of the situation arising out of the
challenge faced by the County on account of Covid-19
virus, has passed an order in suo motu in W.P.(C).
No.3 of 2020, dated 23.03.2020, extending the period
of limitation with effect from 15.03.2020 for filing
the          petitions/applications/suits/appeals      and      other
proceedings,          which  were  indicated   in    that       order
itself. After passing of the above order, a question
arose as to whether the investigating agency can take
advantage of the said order extending time for filing
CRL OP(MD). No.18273 of 2021
charge          sheet,    after   the  period    prescribed         under
38.A Full Bench of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in
S.Kasi Vs. State through the Inspector of Police,
reported in 2020 SCC Online SC 529 has observed that
“ the indefeasible right to default bail under
Section 167(2) is an integral part of the right
to personal liberty under Article 21, and the
said          right    to   bail   cannot   be    suspended          even
during           a  pandemic    situation     as    is    prevailing
currently. It was emphasized that the right of
the accused to be set at liberty takes precedence
over          the   right   of   the  State    to    carry       on    the
investigation and submit a chargesheet.”
39.The     Hon'ble     Apex    Court      has       further
concluded that neither their order, dated 23.03.2020
can be held to have eclipses the time prescribed
under          Section  167(2)    Cr.P.C  nor   the    restrictions,
which have been imposed during the lockdown announced
CRL OP(MD). No.18273 of 2021
by the Government shall operate as any restriction on
the rights of an accused, as protected by Section
167(2) Cr.P.C regarding his indefeasible right to get
a default bail on non submission of charge sheet
within the time prescribed.
40.The   Hon'ble   Apex   Court    has   referred,          its
earlier judgments, for highlighting the purpose and
object of Section 167 Cr.P.C in
(i)   Uday    Mohanlal    Acharcya     Vs.       State        of
(ii) Rakesh Kumar Paul Vs. State of Assam
(iii) Achpal @ Ramswaroop and another Vs. State
of Rajastan 2019 14 SCC 599, and held as follows;
“14.The    Scheme   of    Code   of     Criminal
Procedure as noticed above clearly delineates
that provisions of Section 167 of Code of
Criminal Procedure gives due regard to the
personal    liberty    of    a   person.      Without
submission of charge sheet within 60 days or
90  days  as   may  be  applicable,     an    accused
cannot   be   detained    by    the   Police.        The
provision    gives   due    recognition       to     the
personal liberty.”

41.Considering   the   above,   this    Court      has      no
hesitation to hold that the learned trial Judge has
not dealt with the application filed under Section
167(2) Cr.P.C in proper legal perspective, but by
considering          the  merits   of  the  case    dismissed         the
petition and as such, the impugned order is not good
in law and the same is liable to be set aside.
42.In   the    result,    this   Criminal        Original

of the learned Principal Sessions Judge for EC and
NDPS Act cases, Madurai, is set aside. The petitioner
is ordered to be released on bail on his executing a
bond for a sum of Rs.25,000/- (Rupees Twenty Five
Thousand only) with two sureties each for a like sum
to the satisfaction of the learned Principal Sessions
Judge for EC and NDPS Act cases, Madurai.
i) the sureties shall affix their photographs

iii)the    petitioner   shall    not    tamper         with
evidence or witness.
iv)  the   petitioner  shall   not   abscond        during
trial.
v)On breach of any of the aforesaid conditions,
the         learned   Magistrate/Trial  Court    is   entitled         to
take         appropriate    action against   the   petitioner          in
accordance with law as if the conditions have been
imposed and the petitioner released on bail by the
learned Magistrate/Trial Court himself as laid down
by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in P.K.Shaji vs. State
of Kerala [(2005)AIR SCW 5560].
vi) If the accused thereafter absconds, a fresh
FIR can be registered under Section 229A IPC.
