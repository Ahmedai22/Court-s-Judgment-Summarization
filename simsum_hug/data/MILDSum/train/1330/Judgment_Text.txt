1.      This hearing has been done through hybrid mode.
2.      In this matter on 10th February, 2023, a short affidavit was directed to
be filed by the Respondent within one week. The same is stated to have
been filed on 24th February, 2023 by Mr. Digpaul, ld. CGSC vide diary
number 341041. However, the same is not on record.
3.      It is noticed that in a large number of matters, the affidavit/other
pleadings are filed by the parties. However, on the date when the matters are
listed, for whatever reasons including the delay, the Registry does not put
the same on record.        It is directed that in order to avoid unnecessary

the Court can pass appropriate orders.
4.      The present petition has been preferred by the Petitioner - Spread
Infotech Consultants Pvt. Ltd. seeking directions to the Respondents to
allow benefit of Companies Fresh Start Scheme (CFSS) in respect of
overdue filings to the Petitioner who could not avail the benefit of filing
under CFSS-2020 by 31st December, 2020.
5.      The Petitioner company was incorporated on 3rd September, 2003
and filed its balance sheet for the year 2003-04. Admittedly, with effect
from the year 2004-05, no balance sheets and documents were filed by the
Petitioner. In view thereof, the Respondent No.2 – Registrar of Companies,
NCT of Delhi & Haryana ( hereinafter, “ROC”) struck off the name of the
Petitioner company under Section 248 (1) of the Companies Act, 2013 read
with Rule 7 of the Companies (Removal of Names of Companies from the
Register of Companies) Rules, 2016. The striking off of the company took
place on 13th June, 2017.
6.      The Petitioner was one of many companies, which was struck off due
to non-filing of requisite documents and the DIN/DIRs of the directors were
suspended.
7.      Thereafter, steps were taken for the restoration of the company. The
Petitioner company was restored vide order dated 27th February, 2019
passed by the NCLT. The operative portion of the said order reads as under:
“13. Accordingly, this appeal is allowed. The
Public Notice of Registrar of Companies striking
the name of the company is set aside. The
restoration of the company's name to the Register
of Registrar, of Companies is ordered subject to its
filing of all outstanding documents with proper
filing fees along with additional fees required
W.P.(C) 4578/2021                                                    Page 2 of 7
under law and completion of all formalities,
including payment of any late fee or any other
charges which are leviable by the respondent for
the late filing of statutory returns, and also subject
to payment of cost of Rs.25,000/· to be paid to
Prime Minister's Relief Fund. The name of the
Appellant Company shall then, as a consequence,
stand restored to the Register of the Registrar of
Companies, as if the name of the company had not
been struck off in accordance with Section 248(1)
of the Companies Act, 20.13. ”
8.      Since inception, the Petitioner had two directors namely Ms. Chandra
Prabha and Mr. Ravinder Singh Chauhan. Since the DIN/DIR of Mr.
Ravinder Singh Chauhan was deactivated/suspended, a writ petition was
filed before this Court seeking restoration of the same. The said writ petition
being W.P.(C) 6886/2020 titled Ravinder Singh Chauhan v. Ministry of
Corporate Affairs & Anr. was disposed of vide order dated 24th September,
2020 in the following terms:
“The learned counsel for the petitioner submits
that the case of the petitioner is covered by the
judgment dated 04.11.2019 of this Court passed in
W.P.(C) 908812018, titled Mukut Pathak & Ors.
v. Union of India & Anr.
The learned counsel for the respondents,
however, submits that the petition is liable to be
dismissed on the ground of delay and laches.
I do not find any merit in the objection
raised by the learned counsel for the respondents.
A Coordinate Bench of this Court, in its judgment
dated 02.09.2020 passed in WP(C) 549012020,
titled Sandeep Agarwal & Anr. v. Union of India
& Anr., has already rejected such submission.
In view of the above, the present petition is
disposed of in terms of the ahovementioned
W.P.(C) 4578/2021                                                       Page 3 of 7
judgment of this Court in W.P.(C) 908812018,
titled Mukut Pathak & Ors. v. Union of India &
9.      Accordingly, the DIN of the Mr. Ravinder Singh Chauhan was to be
restored by the ROC. The Petitioner filed an application for restoration of
the same on 23rd October, 2020. In the meantime, the CFSS was announced
by the Ministry of Corporate Affairs on 30th March, 2020. The said scheme
was in operation between 1st April, 2020 till 30th September, 2020. Vide
order dated 28th September, 2020 passed by the Ministry of Corporate
Affairs, the said scheme was extended till 31st December, 2020 The said
extension order reads as under:
“Subject: Extension of Companies Fresh Start
In continuation to this Ministry's General
Circular No.12/2020 dated 30.03.2020, in view of
the large scale disruption caused by the COVID-
19 Pandemic and after due examination, it has
been decided to extend aforesaid
scheme till 31st December. 2020. All other
requirements provided in the said circular shall
remain unchanged.
2.     This issues with the approval of the
competent authority”
As per the scheme, as a one-time opportunity defaulting company could
submit all the documents by paying a nominal fee in accordance with the
Companies (Registration Offices and Fee) Rules, 2014.
10.     The DIN of Mr. Ravinder Singh Chauhan was finally restored on 6th
January, 2021, after the last date of the CFSS Scheme viz., on 31st
December, 2020. Thus, the Petitioner prays that since there was a delay in
W.P.(C) 4578/2021                                                  Page 4 of 7
the restoration of the DIN, by the ROC, which led to the Petitioner not being
able to avail the CFSS. The filing of the documents could not be done during
the currency of the CFSS. Thus, vide the present petition the Petitioner prays
that the benefit of CFSS ought to be allowed for the Petitioner and delay in
filing ought to be condoned.
11.     Ld. counsel for the Petitioner has vehemently argued that various
compliances were undertaken by the Petitioner, after the company was
restored by filing of the documents relating to the years 2004-05 and 2005-
06. However, insofar as the subsequent years i.e. 2006 onwards are
concerned, since the DIN of the second director Mr. Ravinder Singh
Chauhan was not restored, the filing of the balance sheets could not be done
as the DIN was required of both directors. The delay in restoring the DIN is
purely a delay by the ROC. Further, the Petitioner cannot be deprived of the
12.     On the other hand, ld. Counsel for the Respondents submits that the
Petitioner company had two directors namely Mrs. Chandra Prabha and Mr.
Ravinder Singh Chauhan till the year 2020. Thereafter, with effect from
2021, a third director i.e. Mr. Virender Singh Chauhan was also added. Ld.
Counsel submits that the issue, in the present case is that the Petitioner was
in default for several years and had not filed the documents. Various other
documents including form DIR 12 etc. were submitted with digital signature
of Mrs. Chandra Prabha, however, for whatever reasons, the balance sheet
was not submitted. He further submits that the compliances in respect of
2004-05 and 2005-06 were undertaken by the company on 14th September,
2020 but for remaining years, the compliances were not undertaken. Finally,
it is submitted that the CFSS is a scheme, which came to an end on 31st
W.P.(C) 4578/2021                                                      Page 5 of 7
December, 2020 and the benefits, if extended in this manner to companies,
which do not comply and file the documents within the CFSS, would result
in extension of benefits to various defaulting companies, which was not
contemplated under the scheme.
13.     The Court has considered the matter.
14.     The first and the foremost fact that deserves to be highlighted is that
after the Petitioner company was incorporated in the year 2003, only one
Balance Sheet/ Annual Return was filed. There is no explanation whatsoever
for non-filing of the documents and the balance sheets for more than a
decade by the company. This led to the company being struck off and
disqualification of the directors in 2017. The Petitioner has chosen to get
the company restored only in 2019 and the DIN restored in September, 2020
after filing of a writ petition. If there was any delay in processing of the
DIN restoration pursuant to the orders, which were passed by this Court in
W.P.(C) 6886/2020 titled Ravinder Singh Chauhan                 v. Ministry of
Corporate Affairs & Anr., the Petitioner ought to have availed of its
remedies in accordance with law to ensure restoration of the DIN during the
subsistence of CFSS. The Petitioner cannot be seen as being recalcitrant in
its filing of documents and forms and choose to seek extension of benefits of
CFSS, which is merely an alleviating measure. The said Scheme starts by
saying that the alleviating measure has been introduced by the government
primarily in view of the COVID-19 pandemic and was extended in view of
the same.
15.     The Petitioner has been a consistent defaulter in filing the documents
and forms including the balance sheets for over several years. Thus, the
CFSS cannot be extended in this manner beyond the date of operation
W.P.(C) 4578/2021                                                      Page 6 of 7
inasmuch as there were a large number of companies, which were
disqualified and if benefit under CFSS is extended to such companies
beyond the date, the said scheme would be completely unworkable. The
Petitioner was quite conscious of the fact that it had to file its documents and
balance sheets in time, but has chosen not to do so. Thus, the long delay by
the Petitioner cannot be completely sought to be condoned by the two or
three months delay in restoring the DIN by the ROC.
16.     The Petitioner was conscious of the deadlines under the CFSS and
ought to have taken its remedies, but has chosen not to do so. In view of the
same, this would not be a case of an extension the benefit of the CFSS
scheme to the Petitioner.
17.     In the facts and circumstances of this case, considering that the DIN
was restored only after the order was passed by the Court in W.P.(C)
6886/2020, the documents and forms shall be permitted to be submitted by
the Petitioner along with requisite fee in accordance with the Companies Act
and Rules. In the unique facts of the present case, however, there shall be
no prosecution for delay in filing of documents.
18.     The petition, along with all pending applications, is disposed of in the
above terms.
