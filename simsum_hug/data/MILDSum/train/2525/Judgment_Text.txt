Director General (Prisons), New Delhi. The present application has been preferred by the
Director General (Prisons), New Delhi seeking appropriate directions for surrender of
prisons/inmates who had been released on Emergency Parole or Interim Bail pursuant to
the recommendation of the High-Powered Committee, in compliance with the orders dated

No.01/2020, as the COVID-19 situation has now normalized.
3.1     It is not in dispute and cannot be disputed that all those undertrial prisoners/convicts
were released on interim bail/emergency parole taking into consideration the
overcrowding in the prisons and to prevent the spread of COVID-19 virus among prisoners
in over-crowded prisons. All those undertrial prisoners/convicts therefore were not
released on merits but were released on the aforesaid ground alone. Therefore, now when
the COVID-19 situation has now been normalized, all those prisoners/inmates/undertrial
prisoners/convicts who are/were released on emergency parole/interim bail have to
surrender before the concerned prison authorities. As such a similar order has been
passed by this Court in the order dated 03.06.2022 while dismissing IAs No.80311, 80314
& 80316 of 2022 in Suo Moto Writ Petition (Civil) No.01/2020 and SLP (Crl.) Nos. 5507-
5508 of 2022 and 5516 of 2022 by which while dismissing the IAs/SLPs this Court has
granted further 15 days’ time to those applicants/petitioners/prisoners to surrender before
the prison authorities.
3.2     At this stage it is required to be noted that so far as some other States are
concerned, all those prisoners/inmates who were released on interim bail/emergency
parole pursuant to the recommendation of the High-Powered Committee constituted in
compliance with the orders passed by this Court passed in Suo Moto Writ Petition
No.01/2020 have been recalled.
4.      In view of the above, we allow the present application with an observation and
direction that all those under trials/convicts who have been released on Emergency
Parole/Interim Bail pursuant to the recommendation of the High-Powered Committee, in
compliance of the Orders dated 23.03.2020, 07.05.2021 and 16.07.2021 passed by this
Court in Suo Moto Writ Petition No.01/2020 have to surrender before the concerned prison
authorities within 15 days.
The present order be intimated to the concerned Accused/inmates by the concerned
jail authorities that they have now to surrender within the period of 15 days. However, it is
observed that thereafter after the concerned prisoners/inmates surrender before the
concerned prison authorities it will be open for the concerned undertrials to pray for bail
before the competent court and their applications be considered in accordance with law
and on its own merits. Similarly, after the surrender by the concerned convicts who are
released on Emergency Parole it will be open for them if so advised to pray for suspension
of sentence before the concerned Court in their appeals which might have been pending
which also may be considered in accordance with law and/or on merits.
With this the present application stands disposed of.
