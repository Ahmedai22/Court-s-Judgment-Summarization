1       The Union of India and officials of the Border Security Force1 are in appeal
against a judgment of a Division Bench of the Calcutta High Court dated 18
December 2018 which quashed disciplinary proceedings against the respondent and
reinstated him to his initial position in the BSF.
2       In April 2006, at the time of the alleged misconduct, the respondent was a
Head Constable in the BSF and was deployed to the Seventy-second Battalion. On
2 May 2006, the Commandant directed the Deputy Commandant to prepare a
record of evidence2 against the respondent for an offence constituting ―disgraceful
conduct‖ under Section 24(a) of the Border Security Force Act 1968 3. The specific
allegation, as set out in the order, was as follows:
In that he, between 0200 Hrs to 0600 Hrs on 16.04.2006 while on
Naka duty under BOP Sahab Khan committed sodomy on the
person of No. [xyz] Const [xyz] of the sam(e) Battalion.‖
3       The incident in question is alleged to have taken place on the night
intervening 16 and 17 April 2006. The complainant, a Constable in the BSF, was on
Naka duty between 02:00 to 06:00 hours when the respondent is alleged to have
committed an act of sexual assault on him. The complainant submitted a written
complaint on 19 April 2006. Under the BSF Act 1968, such conduct is liable to be
prosecuted under Section 24(a) which reads as follows:
―24. Certain forms of disgraceful conduct.—Any person
subject to this Act who commits any of the following offences,
(a) is guilty of any disgraceful conduct of a cruel, indecent or
shall, on conviction by a Security Force Court, be liable to suffer
imprisonment for a term which may extend to seven years or
such less punishment as is in this Act mentioned.‖
4        The RoE was prepared by the Deputy Commandant and submitted to the
Commandant. On 10 June 2006, the Commandant noted that on a scrutiny of the
RoE proceedings, it was found that there was an inconsistency in the statements of
the witnesses as regards the date on which the incident had occurred. Hence, on 10
June 2006, the Commandant called for the preparation of an additional RoE.
Following the receipt of the additional RoE, the Commandant issued an order to
convene a Summary Security Force Court4 to try the respondent. In the course of
the evidence which was recorded pursuant to the direction of the Commandant
seeking an additional RoE, the complainant stated that the incident took place on 17
April 2006. The respondent was provided with copies of the RoE, additional RoE
and the charge sheet on 3 August 2006.
5         On 7 August 2006, the SSFC convened at the Headquarters of the seventy-
second Battalion of the BSF, at Narayanpur, Malda (West Bengal) for enquiring into
the charge under Section 24(a) the BSF Act 1968. The respondent pleaded not
guilty to the charge. Four prosecution witnesses were examined and the respondent
was furnished with an opportunity to cross-examine them and to call for defence
witnesses. The SSFC found the respondent guilty of the charge and demoted him to
the rank of a Constable as a punishment.
6         On 6 September 2006, the respondent filed a statutory petition under Section
1175 of the BSF Act 1968 before the Director-General of the BSF to challenge the
conviction recorded by the SSFC on 7 August 2006. The statutory petition was
heard by the appellate authority – the Director-General of BSF and was disposed of
by an order dated 18 October 2006. While the charge against the respondent was
found to have been established, the punishment of reduction to the rank of
Constable was commuted, having regard to the fact that the respondent had over 22
years of unblemished service with 21 rewards to his credit. The respondent was
informed that the Director-General of the BSF had commuted the sentence of
reduction to the rank of Constable by substituting it with the following:
―117. Remedy against order, finding or sentence of Security Force Court.—(1) Any person subject to this Act
who considers himself aggrieved by any order passed by any Security Force Court may present a petition to the
officer or authority empowered to confirm any finding or sentence of such Security Force Court, and the confirming
authority may take such steps as may be considered necessary to satisfy itself as to the correctness, legality or
propriety of the order passed or as to the regularity of any proceeding to which the order relates.
(2) Any person subject to this Act who considers himself aggrieved by a finding or sentence of any Security Force
Court which has been confirmed, may present a petition to the Central Government, the Director-General, or any
prescribed officer superior in command to the one who confirmed such finding or sentence, and the Central
Government, the Director-General, or the prescribed officer, as the case may be, may pass such order thereon as it
―(i) ‗To forfeit 05 years services for the purpose of promotion‘;
(ii) ‗To forfeit 07 years past service for the purpose of pension‘;
7        The respondent moved the High Court at Calcutta under Article 226 of the
Constitution. A Single Judge of the High Court, by an order dated 7 May 2009, set
aside the order of punishment on the ground that:
(i)     The original RoE was insufficient to prove the charge; and
(ii)    The order of the Commandant for preparing an additional RoE was
beyond jurisdiction.
8        The judgment of the Single Judge has been upheld by the impugned
judgment of the Division Bench of the High Court on 18 October 2018 on the ground
(i)     The Commandant did not have jurisdiction to direct the preparation
of an additional RoE under Rule 51 of the Border Security Force
Rules 19696 as it stood at the relevant time; and
(ii)    No reasons were furnished by the SSFC or the Appellate Authority -
Director General of BSF - for holding the respondent guilty.
9     Ms Madhavi Divan, Additional Solicitor General appearing on behalf of the
appellants has urged the following submissions:
(i)   The High Court has taken a hyper-technical view of the matter and has failed
to appreciate that the provisions of the BSF Act 1968 and BSF Rules 1969
are robust enough to cover the present case;
(ii)  The Commandant directed the preparation of an additional RoE by his order
dated 10 June 2006. It is evident from a reading of the original RoE and
additional RoE that this is not a case of ―insufficient evidence‖ as envisaged
under Rule 59 of the BSF Rules 1969, but a case of "clarificatory evidence";
(iii) In a minor inaccuracy, the complainant had stated that the incident took place
on 16 April 2006 when he was detailed to Naka duty, whereas the incident
actually took place on the intervening night of 16 April 2006 and 17 April
2006. It was this inaccuracy which was sought to be corrected in the
(iv)  There is no provision under the statute or under the rules prohibiting the
Commandant from directing the recording of additional evidence;
(v)   In 2011, Rule 51 was amended by the insertion of clause (2) under which an
express power has been conferred on the Commandant to direct the
recording of further evidence. This provision is clarificatory in nature;
(vi)  In any event, Rule 6 is wide enough to cover any alleged limitation in Rule 51.
―6. Case unprovided for. - In regard to any matter not specifically
provided for in these rules, it shall be lawful for the competent
authority to do such thing or take such action as may be just and
(vii)      The conclusion of the High Court that the Commandant did not possess the
authority to order the recording of additional evidence and that he had
usurped the power of the superior authority under Rule 59, is perverse; and
(viii)     Neither the provisions of Rule 149 nor those of Section 117(2) require the
SSFC or the Director-General to give reasons in support of their decision.
This principle is settled by the judgment of this Court in Union of India v.
10         On the other hand, Mr Rabin Majumder appearing on behalf of the
respondent has urged the following submissions:
(i)      Rule 6 of the BSF Rules 1969 applies only to a matter which is not
specifically provided in the Rules. On the contrary, Rule 51 specifically
enunciates the power of the Commandant. In the absence of specific
conferment of power to order the preparation of an additional RoE at the
material time, the Commandant had no power to do so;
(ii)     The power to record further evidence is conferred only on a superior
(iii)    Where a Commandant decides under Rule 51(2)(iv) to apply to a
competent officer to convene a court for the trial of a person, only such
officer or authority can exercise any of the powers provided in Rule 59
which includes returning the case for recording further evidence, if the
(iv) As a result of the order of the Commandant, the evidence of the same
witnesses was recorded twice over and without the authority of law. In the
process of doing so, the Commandant usurped the power of the superior
officer or authority who exercises specific powers under Rule 59;
(v)  The SSFC has not recorded any reason to support the conclusion that the
(vi) The facts of the case would indicate that:
(a) The RoE prepared by the officer detailed by the Commandant by his
order dated 2 May 2006 was insufficient to prove the charge;
(b) The preparation of the additional RoE was ordered to furnish the
prosecution witnesses who had already been examined, cross-
examined and re-examined – with a second chance to prove the
(c) The authority which decided the statutory petition under Section 117
has not found that the RoE prepared in accordance with the order of
the Commandant dated 2 May 2006 was insufficient to prove the
(vii)   The decision of the SSFC is vitiated by incurable illegality, since the order
passed on the basis of additional RoE prepared in terms of Commandant‘s
order dated 10 June 2006 was without jurisdiction;
(viii)  The Division Bench of the High Court was justified in holding that the
SSFC is required to furnish a modicum of reasons in support of its
conclusion of guilt, and some application of mind must be demonstrated.
Rule 151 requires reasons to be furnished for awarding the sentence when
a finding of guilt is returned. A range of sentences has been prescribed
and reasons to support the order of a particular sentence is necessary;
(ix)    The High Court was justified in holding that the finding of guilt cannot be
based on an ipse dixit order of the superior officers. Unless the ultimate
decision is informed by reason, it will fall foul of Article 14 of the
11      The rival submissions will now be analysed.
12      Essentially, down to its core, the controversy in the present case turns upon
two aspects: firstly, whether the Commandant prior to the amendment of Rule 51 in
2011 had jurisdiction to direct the preparation of an additional RoE; and secondly,
whether the finding of guilt which has been recorded by the SSFC stands vitiated in
the absence of reasons. Now, before we analyse the first of the above two facets, it
becomes necessary to understand the circumstances in which the Commandant
directed the Assistant Commandant to prepare an additional RoE on 10 June 2006.
13     On 2 May 2006, the Deputy Commandant of the Seventy-second Battalion
was detailed to prepare a RoE on the allegation that the respondent had committed
an offence under Section 24(a) of the BSF Act 1968. The allegation was that when
he was on Naka duty from 02:00 hours to 06:00 hours on 16 April 2006, the
respondent had committed an act of sexual assault on a Constable. In the course of
preparing the RoE, the complainant, examined as PW1, reported that:
―I joined 72 BN BSF on 19 Feb 2006 and further posted to B-Coy
of Unit B-Coy is deployed in Sahebkhale Sub-Sector. I went to
BOP Sahebkhali on 03 April 06 and afterward had been
performing duty in BOP Sahebkhali. I was on Naka/Patrolling
duty from 0200Hrs to 0600 Hrs on 16 April 06 alongwith
No.84001083 HC Mudrika Singh. At 0400Hrs on 16 April 06 while
both of us were sitting on OP Machan (OP No.2) HC Mudrika
Singh caught my Penis. HC Mudrika Singh bounded me to
undergo sex with him by force. Which incident I reported to Coy
Commder on same day at 0800 hrs. But I did not do sex with
Besides the complainant, the evidence included the statement of PW2, who
produced an extract of the General Duty Register on 17 April 2006. PW2 deposed
that the respondent and the complainant left for patrolling at 01:50 hours on 17 April
2006 and returned at 06:25 hours on 17 April 2006.
14     PW2‘s evidence demonstrates that there was an evident error in PW1‘s
reference to 16 April 2006. The incident took place in the night which intervened 16
and 17 April 2006, i.e., in the early hours of 17 April 2006. It was in this backdrop,
that on 10 June 2006, the Commandant ordered the Assistant Commandment to
prepare an additional RoE so as to clarify the date on which the incident had
occurred. Significantly, after the SSFC‘s order dated 7 August 2006 by which the
respondent‘s rank was reduced to that of a Constable, in the course of his statutory
―That I was charged with false allegation that at about 4.00 hrs on
17th April, 2006 while on Nake duty in AOR of BOP Sahebkhali I
caught hold of the Penis of No. [xyz] constable [xyz] of the same
―That I categorically say that because constable [xyz] was lying or
Machan on 17.4.2006 at about 04.50 hrs. and was sleeping I
awoke him and told him to keep watch upon the weapons and
sets otherwise there can be stolen and I further told him that if he
sleeps during duty hours then I would report (sic) him to the (sic)
Commandant. I say that because I gave the warning to [xyz] for
his negligence in duty he made false allegation against me for
The above extract would make it abundantly clear that there was no ambiguity,
insofar as the respondent is concerned that the alleged conduct with which he was
charged, had taken place in the early hours of 17 April 2006. As a matter of fact, the
defence of the respondent also pertains to the same incident on 17 April 2006 and
the respondent contended that the complainant had levelled a false allegation upon
being found to be sleeping while on duty.
15      In this backdrop, it becomes necessary to emphasize that the additional RoE
which was ordered by the Commandant was essentially in the nature of a
clarification having regard to the discrepancy about the date of the incident namely,
whether it was on 16 or 17 April 2006. This was evidently because the incident took
place on the intervening night of 16 and 17 April. As noted above, the respondent
himself has in the course of his statutory petition, sought to highlight the events
which had transpired in the early hours of 17 April 2006 when he was on duty. After
settling the issue of insufficiency of evidence, we advert to the two questions of law
that have been raised in the appeal: (i) whether the Commandant has the jurisdiction
to direct preparation of an additional RoE; and (ii) whether the SSFC is under an
obligation to record reasons under Rule 159 of the BSF Rules 1969 when it
determines the guilt of an accused.
16     The unamended Rule 51 of the BSF Rules 1969 provided as follows:
―51. Disposal of case against an enrolled person by
Commandant after record or abstract of evidence.-
(1) Where an officer has been detailed to prepare the record of
evidence or to make an abstract thereof, he shall forward the
same to the Commandant.
(2) The Commandant may, after going through the record or
abstract of evidence including additional evidence:
(ii) rehear the charge and award one of the summary
(iii) try the accused by a Summary Security Force Court where
(iv) apply to a competent officer or authority to convene a
Under sub-rule (1) of Rule 51, an officer who is detailed to prepare the RoE has to
forward it to the Commandant8. Thereafter under Rule 51 (2), the Commandant may,
after going through the record, proceed with any of the course of actions detailed in
(i) to (iv), which includes trying the accused by an SSFC. The High Court has
noticed that as a result of the amendment in 20119, what is previously included in
Rule 51(2) has been, in substance, incorporated in Rule 51(3) of the amended BSF
Rules 1969. A new sub-rule (2) has been introduced which reads as follows:
"(2) if the Commandant considers the evidence recorded
insufficient but considers that further evidence may be available,
he may remand the case for recording additional evidence."
The amended Rule 51 of the BSF Rules 1969 thus provides for the following:
―51. Disposal of case against enrolled person by Commandant
(1) Where an officer has been detailed to prepare the record of
evidence or to make an abstract thereof, he shall forward the
same to the Commandant.
(2) If the Commandant considers the evidence recorded
insufficient but considers that further evidence may be available,
he may remand the case for recording additional evidence.
(3) The Commandant may, after going through the record or
abstract of evidence including additional evidence, if any:—
(i) dismiss the charge after recording the reasons thereof[sic]; or
(ii) rehear the charge and award summary punishments; or
(iii) try the accused by a Summary Security Force Court where he
Section 2(1)(f) of the BSF Act 1968 defines it thus: ―2. (1)(f) ‗Commandant‘, when used in any provision of this Act
with reference to any unit of the Force, means the officer whose duty it is under the rules to discharge with respect to
that unit, the functions of a Commandant in regard to matters of the description referred to in that provision‖
Provided that the Commandant while convening a Court may
(iv) apply to a competent officer or authority to convene a Court
17      The High Court inferred that ―the incorporation of the amendment
demonstrates that at the relevant point of time, the Commandant did not have the
power to direct additional evidence to be recorded‖. Yet, the High Court also
observed that the 2011 amendment to the BSF Rules 1969 could be of a
―At the same time, the amendment can be regarded to be
clarificatory in nature, in the sense that it was not required to be
specifically provided but was inherent to the general authority of
the Commandant; and the amendment has been brought by way
of abundant caution and to clarify the powers of the Commandant
instead of conferring any new authority unto such officer.‖
However, the High Court declined to inquire further into this line of interpretation on
the ground that ―there is no submission which has been put forth by either side to
throw any light on the relevant provision‖. On this ground, the Division Bench held
that the view of the Single Judge ―appears to be a possible view‖ and does not call
for interference. The legal position needs to be analysed.
18      Rule 48 of the BSF Rules 1969 provides for the preparation of a record of
―48. Record of evidence.- (1) The officer ordering the record
of evidence may either prepare the record of evidence
himself or detail another officer to do so.
(2) The witnesses shall give their evidence in the presence of the
accused and the accused shall have right to cross-examine all
Provided that where statement of any witness at a court of inquiry
is available, examination of such a witness may be dispensed
with and the original copy of the said statement may be taken on
record. A copy thereof shall be given to the accused and he shall
have the right to cross-examine if he was not afforded an
opportunity to cross -examine the witness at the Court of Inquiry.
(3) After all the witnesses against the accused have been
examined, he shall be cautioned in the following terms; ―You may
make a statement if you wish to do so, you are not bound to
make one and whatever you state shall be taken down in writing
and may be used in evidence.‖ After having been cautioned in
the aforesaid manner whatever the accused states shall be taken
down in writing.
(4) The accused may call witnesses in defence and the
officer recording the evidence may ask any question that
may be necessary to clarify the evidence given by such
(5) All witnesses shall give evidence on oath or affirmation:
Provided that, no oath or affirmation shall be given to the
accused nor shall he be cross-examined.
(6) (a) The statements given by witnesses shall ordinarily be
recorded in narrative form and the officer recording the evidence
may, at the request of the accused, permit any portion of the
evidence to be recorded in the form of question and answer.
(b) Witnesses shall sign their statements after the same have
been read over and explained to them.
(6A) The provisions of section 89 of the Act shall apply for
procuring the attendance of the witnesses before the officer
preparing the Record of Evidence.
(7) Where a witness cannot be compelled to attend or is not
available or his attendance cannot be procured without an undue
expenditure of time or money and after the officer recording the
evidence has given a certificate in this behalf, a written statement
signed by such witness may be read to the accused and included
in the record of evidence.
(8) After the recording of evidence is completed the officer
recording the evidence shall give a certificate in following form :-
―Certified that the record of evidence ordered by...
..Commandant... .....................................................was made in
the presence and hearing of the accused and the provisions of
rule 48 have been complied with‖.
19      Rule 48 of the BSF Rules 1969 clarifies that an officer ordering the RoE may
either prepare it himself or detail any officer to do so. The witnesses have to give
their evidence in the presence of the accused who has a right to cross-examine
them. The accused may call witnesses in defence. An officer recording the evidence
is empowered under sub-rule (4) of Rule 48 to ask a question that may be
necessary to clarify the evidence given by a witness. It is on the basis of the RoE (or
the abstract of evidence, as the case may be) that the Commandant is empowered
to take the actions which are referred to in the unamended sub-rule (2) of Rule 51,
as it then stood. Under Rule 51(2) which was applicable then, the Commandant was
empowered to dismiss the charge; re-hear the charge and award one of the
summary punishments; try the accused by SSFC; or apply to a competent officer or
authority to convene a court for the trial of the accused.
20      The unamended sub-rule (2) of Rule 51, as was applicable to the facts of the
present case, cannot be construed to impose a prohibition on the Commandant to
seek clarification, and for that purpose of ordering an additional RoE, to facilitate or
aid the further processing of the case. Rule 51(2) does not contain any such
prohibition. On the contrary, sub-rule(1) to Rule 48 indicates that the officer ordering
the RoE may either prepare an RoE himself or detail another officer to do so. Sub-
rule(4) to Rule 48 empowers the officer to ask any question that may be necessary
to clarify the evidence. If such a power is conferred upon the officer ordering the
RoE while preparing the RoE himself, it would follow by necessary implication, that
such a power is available to the Commandant even when the RoE is ordered to be
prepared by another officer. The purpose of seeking such a clarification is to
facilitate the emergence of the truth as regards the genesis of an incident which is
the subject matter of the enquiry. The mere fact that a specific provision empowering
the Commandant to call for further evidence was introduced in 2011 cannot result in
the conclusion that absent such a power being expressly incorporated, the power
did not vest in the Commandant.
21       An amendment to a statute or to statutory rules may often be clarificatory in
nature. It is clarificatory in the sense that it expressly recognizes a power that
already vests in the authority. In those circumstances, when an amendment is purely
clarificatory or declaratory in nature, it is deemed to operate retrospectively. 10 For
instance, a Constitution Bench in Shyam Sunder v. Ram Kumar 11 held that an
amending act or a declaratory act need not explicitly mention its declaratory nature
to be operative retrospectively. Speaking on behalf of the Constitution Bench,
―39. Lastly, it was contended on behalf of the appellants that the
amending Act whereby new Section 15 of the Act has been
substituted is declaratory and, therefore, has retroactive
G P Singh, PRINCIPLES OF STATUTORY Interpretation (13 edn, 2012); Commissioner of Income Tax v. Vatika
Township, (2015) 1 SCC 1, para 32 (Constitution Bench); Ghanshyam Mishra and Sons v. Edelweiss Asset
operation. Ordinarily when an enactment declares the previous
law, it requires to be given retroactive effect. The function of a
declaratory statute is to supply an omission or to explain a
previous statute and when such an Act is passed, it comes
into effect when the previous enactment was passed. The
legislative power to enact law includes the power to declare what
was the previous law and when such a declaratory Act is passed,
invariably it has been held to be retrospective. Mere absence of
use of the word “declaration” in an Act explaining what was
the law before may not appear to be a declaratory Act but if
the court finds an Act as declaratory or explanatory, it has to
be construed as retrospective. Conversely where a statute
uses the word ―declaratory‖, the words so used may not be
sufficient to hold that the statute is a declaratory Act as words
may be used in order to bring into effect new law.‖
In Zile Singh v. State of Haryana12, Chief Justice R C Lahoti, speaking for a three-
judge bench elaborated on the principle of retrospective operation applicable to
―13…. Unless there are words in the statute sufficient to show the
intention of the legislature to affect existing rights, it is deemed to
be prospective only — ―nova constitutio futuris formam imponere
debet non praeteritis‖ — a new law ought to regulate what is to
follow, not the past. (See Principles of Statutory Interpretation
by Justice G.P. Singh, 9th Edn., 2004 at p. 438.) It is not
necessary that an express provision be made to make a
statute      retrospective     and     the    presumption        against
retrospectivity may be rebutted by necessary implication
especially in a case where the new law is made to cure an
acknowledged evil for the benefit of the community as a whole
(ibid., p. 440).
14. The presumption against retrospective operation is not
applicable to declaratory statutes…. In determining, therefore,
the nature of the Act, regard must be had to the substance rather
than to the form. If a new Act is “to explain” an earlier Act, it
would be without object unless construed retrospectively.
An explanatory Act is generally passed to supply an obvious
omission or to clear up doubts as to the meaning of the previous
Act. It is well settled that if a statute is curative or merely
declaratory of the previous law retrospective operation is
generally intended…. An amending Act may be purely
declaratory to clear a meaning of a provision of the principal Act
which was already implicit. A clarificatory amendment of this
nature will have retrospective effect (ibid., pp. 468-69).
16. Where a statute is passed for the purpose of supplying
an obvious omission in a former statute or to “explain” a
former statute, the subsequent statute has relation back to
the time when the prior Act was passed. The rule against
retrospectivity is inapplicable to such legislations as are
22      This Court has often recognized amendments to service rules as clarificatory
in nature, thereby having a retrospective operation13. In our view, the power to order
additional RoE is incidental to realize the purpose of Rules 48 and 51. In any event,
residual powers under Rule 6 would protect this action. Since the express power to
direct additional RoE under Rule 51 was incidental to the exercise of the existing
powers, the amendment to Rule 51 which was brought in 2011 must be construed to
be clarificatory. In fact, the High Court proceeded on this line of analysis by
observing that the amendment is clarificatory. However, it chose to not take it to its
logical conclusion on the tenuous ground that no submission had been put forth by
either side to throw light on the relevant provision.
23       In our view, and for the reasons that we have indicated, the fact that the
incident took place in the present case prior to the date of the amendment, i.e., 25
November 2011, would make no difference once the amendment, in the true sense
S B Bhattacharjee v. S D Majumdar, (2007) 10 SCC 513 (two-judge Bench); O P Lather v. Satish Kumar
of the expression, is construed to be clarificatory in nature. Against this backdrop,
the Commandant was acting within his jurisdiction in ordering an additional RoE to
clarify the date of the incident. As we have seen earlier, strictly speaking, this is not
a case of insufficient evidence. During the course of the RoE, the respondent
himself stood by the complainant‘s version of the date and time on which the alleged
incident took place, which was the night when the respondent was detailed to Naka
duty as Head Constable. The only issue for which additional RoE was warranted
was in regard to the confusion in regard to the precise date on which the incident
took place, considering the confusion caused by the incident having occurred on the
intervening night of 16 and 17 April 2006. Save and except for this, the RoE which
was prepared initially was comprehensive in nature and contained all necessary
details of the incident, which were sufficient to sustain the final conclusion.
24      The submission of the respondent that the Commandant has usurped the
power of a superior officer or authority under Rule 59 is patently incorrect. Rule 59
provides for the action which has to be taken by a superior authority on receiving the
application for convening a court. In that context, Rule 59(1) provides as follows:
―59. Action by a Superior Authority on receiving an
application for convening a court.- (1) As soon as a superior
officer receives an application for convening a court, he shall
scrutinise the charge and the evidence against the accused,
where necessary in consultation with the Chief Law Officer or a
(i)      shall direct the Commandant to dismiss the charge where
the evidence against the accused is insufficient and further
evidence is not likely to be available and may direct him to do so
if he considers it inadvisable to proceed with the trial; or
(ii)     may return the case to Commandant for being tried by a
Summary Security Force Court or being dealt with summarily if
he considers that the same can be adequately so tried or dealt
(iii) may return the case for recording further evidence, if he
considers the evidence recorded insufficient but considers that
(iv)     may dispose of the case administratively under chapter
IV of these rules if competent to do so, or refer it to the
competent authority for disposal, where he is of the opinion that
the charge against a person is serious but the trial by Security
Force Court is inexpedient or not reasonably practicable for the
(v)      may, after recording the reasons, dispose of the case
administratively under chapter XIV A of these rules if competent
to do so, or refer it to the competent authority for disposal, where
he is of the opinion that the charge against the officer or the
subordinate officer, as the case may be, does not deserve to be
dismissed but also not so serious as to warrant trial by a Security
(2)      (a)     In any other case he may either himself convene
a Court or if he considers that a higher type of Court should be
convened and he is not empowered to convene such a Court,
forward the case to a higher authority with recommendation that
such Court may be convened.
(b)      The higher authority on receiving the case may exercise
any of the powers given in sub-rule (1) of this rule:
Provided that a superior officer or higher authority before
convening a General Security Force Court or a Petty Security
Force Court shall take the advice of the Chief Law Officer or a
Law officer.
Provided further that the superior authority or higher authority
while convening a Court may reframe the charge sheet on which
Clause (iii) of sub-rule (1) of Rule 59 indicates that one of the courses of action open
to the superior authority is to return the case for recording evidence if the evidentiary
record is considered to be insufficient but the superior authority considers that
further evidence may be available. The provisions of Rule 59(1)(iii) cannot be
stretched to mean that absent the conferment of a specific or express power to the
Commandant in similar terms, the Commandant had no jurisdiction to seek
clarification or order an additional RoE. The power of the Commandant to do so is
implicit, as noticed earlier in Rules 48 and 51, read with Rule 6. Hence, it cannot be
postulated that by ordering an additional RoE, the Commandant had usurped the
power of a superior authority or acted contrary to the jurisdiction conferred upon him.
25      The second ground on which the Division Bench of the High Court held the
findings of the SSFC to be vitiated is that under Rule 148, the SSFC was required to
furnish at least ―a modicum of reasons‖. Rules 148 and 149 provide as follows:
―148. Verdict.- The Court shall after the evidence for prosecution
and defence has been heard, give its opinion as to whether the
accused is guilty or not guilty of the charge or charges.
149. Finding.- (1) The finding on every charge upon which
the accused is arraigned shall be recorded and except as
mentioned in these rules shall be recorded simply as a
finding of “Guilty” or of “Not Guilty”.
(2) When the Court is of opinion as regards any charge that the
facts proved do not disclose the offence charged or any offence
of which he might under the Act legally be found guilty on the
charge as laid, the Court shall find the accused ―Not Guilty‖ of
that charge.
(3) When the Court is of opinion as regards any charge that the
facts found to be proved in evidence differ materially from the
facts alleged in the statement of particulars in the charge, but are
nevertheless sufficient to prove the offence stated in the charge,
and that the difference is not so material as to have prejudiced
the accused in his defence, it may, instead of a finding of ―Not
Guilty‖ record a special finding.
(4) The special finding may find the accused guilty on a charge
subject to the statement of exceptions or variations specified
therein.
(5) The Court shall not find the accused guilty on more than one
of two or more charges laid in the alternative, even if conviction
upon one charge necessarily connotes guilt upon the alternative
The provisions of Rule 149 of the BSF Rules 1969 came up for interpretation before
a two-judge Bench of this Court in Union of India v. Dinesh Kumar14. This Court
was considering over sixty-two appeals from members of the BSF on the sole
ground that orders of the SSFC were illegal since they did not state the reasons for
arriving at their conclusion. Speaking on behalf of this Court, Justice V S Sirpurkar
framed the issues for consideration as follows:
“3. The common questions that falls for consideration in all these
Whether the Summary Security Force Court (SSFC) is required
Whether the appellate authority under Section 117(2) is required
to give reasons while considering the correctness, legality or
The Court noted that under the scheme of the BSF Act 1968, Section 64 provides
for three kinds of courts, namely: (a) General Security Force Courts; (b) Petty
Security Force Courts; and (c) Summary Security Force Courts. Under Section 74(4)
the SFCC may pass any sentence except the sentence of death or imprisonment for
a term exceeding the time limits specified in sub-Section (5), which indicated that the
SSFC had the jurisdiction to try all offences, but had limited powers with respect to
the sentence15. This Court observed that Rule 149 forms a part of Chapter XI of the
BSF Rules 1969 which deals with the procedure for the SSFC. In contradistinction,
Chapter IX of the Rules deals with the procedure for all Security Force Courts.
Chapter IX includes the amended Rule 99(1), which mandates the recording of
reasons. After the amendment in 2003, the amended Rule 99(1) reads as follows:
―99. Record and announcement of finding.—(1) The finding on
every charge upon which the accused is arraigned shall be
recorded and except as provided in these Rules, shall be
recorded simply as a finding of ‗Guilty‘ or of ‗Not Guilty‘. After
recording the finding on each charge, the Court shall give
brief reasons in support thereof. The Law Officer or, if there is
none, the Presiding Officer shall record or cause to be recorded
such brief reasons in the proceedings. The above record shall be
signed and dated by the Presiding Officer and the Law Officer, if
Therefore, under Rule 99(1), it became necessary for the SSFC
to give brief reasons in support of the findings, where the
Noting the lack of an amendment to Rule 149, this Court held:
―17. It is needless to mention that Rule 99 will not apply to
SSFC. The procedure for the SSFC is provided in Chapter XI
(Rules 133 to Rule 161), which alone is relevant here. It must
be noted here that though Rule 99 was amended requiring
authority of General Security Force Court or Petty Security
Force Court to give reasons in support of their findings, no
such amendment was made to Rule 149 which is applicable
in the case of the SSFC. Shri Malhotra, learned Additional
Solicitor General, therefore, rightly argued that since Rule 149
was left intact in contradistinction to Rule 99, the authorities of
the SSFC were not required to give reasons in support of their
findings in all these cases and the High Court has gravely erred
in setting aside the orders of authorities on that count alone.‖
While arriving at the above conclusion in Dinesh Kumar (supra), the Court also
placed reliance on the decision of a Constitution Bench in S N Mukherjee v. Union
26       The Constitution Bench in S N Mukherjee (supra) had affirmed and followed
the decision of a Constitution Bench of this Court in Som Datt Datta v. Union of
India17 which had considered the duty of furnishing reasons on the Chief of Army
Staff and the Union Government when confirming the proceedings of a Court-martial
under the Army Act, 1950. The Court, in Som Datt Datta (supra), held that the
requirement of furnishing reasons does not apply in every case concerning a finding
by a statutory tribunal. Justice V Ramaswami (I), speaking on behalf of the
―9. In the present case it is manifest that there is no express
obligation imposed by Section 164 or by Section 165 of the Army
Act on the confirming authority or upon the Central Government
to give reasons in support of its decision to confirm the
proceedings of the Court Martial. Mr Dutta has been unable to
point out any other section of the Act or any of the Rule made
therein from which necessary implication can be drawn that such
a duty is cast upon the Central Government or upon the
confirming authority. Apart from any requirement imposed by the
statute or statutory rule either expressly or by necessary
implication, we are unable to accept the contention of Mr Dutta
that there is any general principle or any rule of natural justice
that a statutory tribunal should always and in every case give
reasons in support of its decision.
As already stated, there is no express obligation imposed in the
present case either by Section 164 or by Section 165 of the
Indian Army Act on the confirming authority or on the Central
Government to give reasons for its decision. We have also not
been shown any other section of the Army Act or any other
statutory rule from which the necessary implication can be drawn
that such a duty is cast upon the Central Government or upon the
confirming authority. We, therefore, reject the argument of the
petitioner that the order of the Chief of the Army Staff, dated May
26, 1967 confirming the finding of the Court Martial under Section
164 of the Army Act or the order of the Central Government
dismissing the appeal under Section 165 of the Army Act are in
27     Following the decision in Som Datt Datta (supra), the Constitution Bench in S
N Mukherjee (supra) considered the provisions of the Army Act and concluded that
none of the provisions, either expressly or by necessary implication, confer a duty on
the aforesaid authorities to furnish reasons. Justice S C Agrawal, speaking on behalf
of the Constitution Bench, analysed the provisions of the Army Act 1950 on the anvil
―36. Reasons, when recorded by an administrative authority in an
order passed by it while exercising quasi-judicial functions, would
no doubt facilitate the exercise of its jurisdiction by the appellate
or supervisory authority. But the other considerations, referred to
above, which have also weighed with this Court in holding that an
administrative authority must record reasons for its decision, are
of no less significance. These considerations show that the
recording of reasons by an administrative authority serves a
salutary purpose, namely, it excludes chances of arbitrariness
and ensures a degree of fairness in the process of decision-
making. The said purpose would apply equally to all decisions
and its application cannot be confined to decisions which are
subject to appeal, revision or judicial review. In our opinion,
therefore, the requirement that reasons be recorded should
govern the decisions of an administrative authority exercising
quasi-judicial functions irrespective of the fact whether the
decision is subject to appeal, revision or judicial review. It may,
however, be added that it is not required that the reasons should
be as elaborate as in the decision of a court of law. The extent
and nature of the reasons would depend on particular facts and
circumstances. What is necessary is that the reasons are clear
and explicit so as to indicate that the authority has given due
consideration to the points in controversy. The need for recording
of reasons is greater in a case where the order is passed at the
original stage. The appellate or revisional authority, if it affirms
such an order, need not give separate reasons if the appellate or
revisional authority agrees with the reasons contained in the
order under challenge.
39. The object underlying the rules of natural justice ―is to prevent
miscarriage of justice‖ and secure ―fair play in action‖. As pointed
out earlier the requirement about recording of reasons for its
decision by an administrative authority exercising quasi-judicial
functions achieves this object by excluding chances of
arbitrariness and ensuring a degree of fairness in the process of
decision-making. Keeping in view the expanding horizon of the
principles of natural justice, we are of the opinion, that the
requirement to record reason can be regarded as one of the
principles of natural justice which govern exercise of power by
administrative authorities. The rules of natural justice are not
embodied rules. The extent of their application depends upon the
particular statutory framework whereunder jurisdiction has been
conferred on the administrative authority. With regard to the
exercise of a particular power by an administrative authority
including exercise of judicial or quasi-judicial functions the
legislature, while conferring the said power, may feel that it would
not be in the larger public interest that the reasons for the order
passed by the administrative authority be recorded in the order
and be communicated to the aggrieved party and it may dispense
with such a requirement. It may do so by making an express
provision to that effect as those contained in the Administrative
Procedure Act, 1946 of U.S.A. and the Administrative Decisions
(Judicial Review) Act, 1977 of Australia whereby the orders
passed by certain specified authorities are excluded from the
ambit of the enactment. Such an exclusion can also arise by
necessary implication from the nature of the subject matter, the
scheme and the provisions of the enactment. The public interest
underly-ing such a provision would outweigh the salutary purpose
served by the requirement to record the reasons. The said
requirement cannot, therefore, be insisted upon in such a case.‖
The Court conducted a detailed analysis of the provisions of the Army Act 1950 and
held there was no requirement of furnishing reasons for the Chief of Army Staff or
the Union Government when it confirmed proceedings of court-martial:
44. From the provisions referred to above it is evident that the
judge-advocate plays an important role during the course of trial
at a general court martial and he is enjoined to maintain an
impartial position. The court martial records its findings after the
judge-advocate has summed up the evidence and has given his
opinion upon the legal bearing of the case. The members of the
court have to express their opinion as to the finding by word of
mouth on each charge separately and the finding on each charge
is to be recorded simply as a finding of ―guilty‖ or of ―not guilty‖. It
is also required that the sentence should be announced forthwith
in open court. Moreover Rule 66(1) requires reasons to be
recorded for its recommendation in cases where the court makes
a recommendation to mercy. There is no such requirement in
other provisions relating to recording of findings and sentence.
Rule 66(1) proceeds on the basis that there is no such
requirement because if such a requirement was there it would not
have been necessary to make a specific provision for recording
of reasons for the recommendation to mercy. The said provisions
thus negative a requirement to give reasons for its finding and
sentence by the court martial and reasons are required to be
recorded only in cases where the court martial makes a
recommendation to mercy. In our opinion, therefore, at the stage
of recording of findings and sentence the court martial is not
required to record its reasons and at that stage reasons are only
required for the recommendation to mercy if the court martial
Accordingly, on an analysis of the scope and statutory purpose of the Army Act,
1950, the Constitution Bench in S N Mukherjee (supra) concluded that there was no
requirement of furnishing reasons.
28    After adverting to the principles enunciated by the Constitution Bench in S N
Mukherjee (supra) and Som Datt Datta (supra), this Court in Dinesh Kumar
(supra) in the context of Rule 149 of the BSF Rules 1969, held:
“23. In this backdrop, it is clear that the provisions for the SSFC
and the appellate authority are pari materia, more particularly in
case of Rule 149 and Section 117(2) of the Act, with the
provisions which were considered in both the above authorities.
Therefore, there cannot be any escape from the conclusion
that as held by the Constitution Bench, the reasons would
not be required to be given by the SSFC under Rule 149 or
by the appellate authority under Section 117(2) of the Act.
This position is all the more obtained in case of SSFC,
particularly, as the legislature has chosen not to amend Rule
149, though it has specifically amended Rule 99 w.e.f. 9-7-
2003. It was pointed out that in spite of this, some other view was
taken by the Delhi High Court in Nirmal Lakra v. Union of
India [(2003) 102 DLT 415] . However, it need not detain us,
since Rule 149 did not fall for consideration in that case. Even
otherwise, we would be bound by law declared by the
Constitution Bench in S.N. Mukherjee v. Union of India [(1990) 4
29    The decision in Dinesh Kumar (supra) which is based upon the view of the
Constitution Bench in S N Mukherjee (supra) and Som Datt Dutta (supra) provides
a clear answer and negates the finding of the High Court on the mandate of
recording reasons by the SSFC when delivering its finding under Rule 149. Rule 149
does not either expressly or by necessary implication impose a mandate on the
SSFC to record reasons when it renders its findings of guilt on a case referred to it.
30     In the above circumstances, the High Court was in error on both the grounds
which have weighed in its ultimate decision. There was no error of jurisdiction on the
part of the Commandant in seeking clarification in regard to the date of the incident
by calling for an additional RoE. As we have noted, the respondent was not
prejudiced since he understood the allegations against him as pertaining to the
events which transpired on the night when he was on duty, intervening 16 and 17
April 2006, and more specifically in the early hours of 17 April 2006.
31      On the second aspect, the decision of the High Court has failed to notice the
judgment of this Court in Dinesh Kumar (supra) [which in turn is based on
paragraph 40 of the principles enunciated by the Constitution Bench in S N
Mukherjee (supra)]. The charge against the respondent was found to have been
duly substantiated by evidence on the record. While dealing with the respondent‘s
statutory petition under Section 117, the Director-General of BSF, reduced the
quantum of sentence. He was empowered to do so in accordance with the
provisions of Section 48 of the BSF Act 1968. Section 48 provides as follows:
―48. Punishments awardable by Security Force Courts.— 1)
Punishments may be inflicted in respect of offences committed by
persons subject to this Act and convicted by Security Force
Courts according to the scale following, that is to say,— (a)
death; (b) imprisonment which may be for the term of life or any
other lesser term but excluding imprisonment for a term not
exceeding three months in Force custody; (c) dismissal from the
service; (d) imprisonment for a term not exceeding three months
in Force custody; (e) reduction to the ranks or to a lower rank or
grade or place in the list of their rank in the case of an under-
officer; (f) forfeiture of seniority of rank and forfeiture of all or any
part of the service for the purpose of promotion; (g) forfeiture of
service for the purpose of increased pay, pension or any other
prescribed purpose; (h) fine, in respect of civil offences; (i) severe
reprimand or reprimand except in the case of persons below the
rank of an under-officer; (j) forfeiture of pay and allowances for a
period not exceeding three months for an offence committed on
active duty; (k) forfeiture in the case of person sentenced to
dismissal from the service of all arrears of pay and allowances
and other public money due to him at the time of such dismissal;
(l) stoppage of pay and allowances until any proved loss or
damage occasioned by the offence for which he is convicted is
made good. (2) Each of the punishments specified in sub-section
(1) shall be deemed to be inferior in degree to every punishment
Thus, the punishment which has been imposed on the respondent is in compliance
with clauses (a) to (g) of Section 48(1). For the above reasons, we are of the view
that the appeal should be allowed.
32     Before we conclude our analysis, we would also like to highlight a rising trend
of invalidation of proceedings inquiring into sexual misconduct, on hyper-technical
interpretations of the applicable service rules. For instance, the Sexual Harassment
of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition, and Redressal) Act 2013 penalizes
several misconducts of a sexual nature and imposes a mandate on all public and
private organizations to create adequate mechanisms for redressal. However, the
existence of transformative legislation may not come to the aid of persons aggrieved
of sexual harassment if the appellate mechanisms turn the process into a
punishment. It is important that courts uphold the spirit of the right against sexual
harassment, which is vested in all persons as a part of their right to life and right to
dignity under Article 21 of the Constitution. It is also important to be mindful of the
power dynamics that are mired in sexual harassment at the workplace. There are
several considerations and deterrents that a subordinate aggrieved of sexual
harassment has to face when they consider reporting sexual misconduct of their
superior. In the present case, the complainant was a constable complaining against
the respondent who was the head constable – his superior. Without commenting on
the merits of the case, it is evident that the discrepancy regarding the date of
occurrence was of a minor nature since the event occurred soon after midnight and
on the next day. Deeming such a trivial aspect to be of monumental relevance, while
invalidating the entirety of the disciplinary proceedings against the respondent and
reinstating him to his position renders the complainant‘s remedy at nought. The
history of legal proceedings such as these is a major factor that contributes to the
deterrence that civil and criminal mechanisms pose to persons aggrieved of sexual
harassment. The High Court, in this case, was not only incorrect in its interpretation
of the jurisdiction of the Commandant and the obligation of the SSFC to furnish
reasons under the BSF Act 1968 and Rules therein, but also demonstrated a callous
attitude to the gravamen of the proceedings. We implore courts to interpret service
rules and statutory regulations governing the prevention of sexual harassment at the
workplace in a manner that metes out procedural and substantive justice to all the
33     The appeal is accordingly allowed and the impugned judgment and order of
the Division Bench of the Calcutta High Court of 18 December 2018 and of the
Single Judge of the Calcutta High Court on 7 May 2009 are set aside. In
consequence, the writ petition filed by the respondent shall stand dismissed.
34    The appeal is disposed of in the above terms.
35    Pending application(s), if any, shall stand disposed of.
