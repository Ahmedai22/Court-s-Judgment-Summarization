1.          This Special Leave Petition, under Article 136 of the Constitution of
India, filed by the Petitioner, hereinafter referred to as the UPPTCL, is
against a final Judgment and Order dated 24 th February 2020 passed by
the High Court of Judicature at Allahabad (Lucknow Bench), allowing the

Construction Workers’ Welfare Cess Act, 1996, hereinafter referred to as
the “Cess Act”, read with Rules 3 and Rule 4 (1), (2) (3) and (4) of the
Building and Other Construction Workers Welfare Cess Rules, 1998,
hereinafter referred to as the “Cess Rules” and also Section 2 (1)(d), (g)
and (i) of the Building and Other Construction Workers (Regulation of
Employment and Condition of Service) Act, 1996, hereinafter referred to
as the “BOCW Act”.
2.     The BOCW Act has been enacted to regulate the employment and
conditions of service of building and other construction workers and to
provide for their safety, health and welfare measures and for other
matters connected therewith or incidental thereto. As per the Statement
of Objects and Reasons for the BOCW Act, “ it is estimated that about 8.5
million workers in the country are engaged in building and other
construction works. Building and other construction workers are one of the
most numerous and vulnerable segments of the unorganised labour in
India. The building and other construction works are characterised by
their inherent risk to the life and limb of the workers. The work is also
characterised by its casual nature, temporary relationship between
employer and employee, uncertain working hours, lack of basic amenities
and inadequacy of welfare facilities.”
3.     The Statement of Objects and Reasons further state “ in view of the
circumstances explained above, it has been considered necessary to
constitute Welfare Boards in every State so as to provide and monitor
social security schemes and welfare measures for the benefit of building
and other construction workers. For the said purpose, it has been
considered appropriate to bring in a comprehensive legislation by suitably
amplifying the provisions of the Building and Other Construction Workers
(Regulation of Employment and Conditions of Service) Bill, 1988 which
was introduced in the Rajya Sabha on the 5th December, 1988. It has also
been considered necessary to levy a cess on the cost of construction
incurred by the employers on the building and other construction works
for ensuring sufficient funds for the Welfare Boards to undertake the social
security schemes and welfare measures.”
4.    As stated in its Statement of Objects and Reasons, the BOCW Act,
iner alia, provides for the following matters:-
“i) provision to cover every establishment which employs or had
employed on any day of the preceding twelve months, fifty or more
workers in any building or other construction work;
(v) registration of establishments employing construction workers,
(vi) registration of building workers as beneficiaries under the said
Ordinance and provision for their identity cards, etc.;
(vii) constitution of Welfare Boards by the State Governments and
registration of beneficiaries under the Fund;
(viii) provide for financing and augmenting resources of the Welfare Board
(ix) fixing hours for normal working day, weekly paid rest day, wages for
over time, provision of basic welfare: amenities like drinking water,
latrines and urinals, creches, first aid, canteens, etc., for the building
(x) provision for temporary living accommodation to all building workers
(xi) making adequate provisions for safety and health measures for
construction workers including appointment of safety committees and
safety officers and compulsory notification of accidents.”
5.     The Statement of Objects and Reasons reveals that the necessity to
enact BOCW Act arose from the necessity to levy cess on the cost of
construction incurred by the employers on a building and on other
construction works, in order to generate funds for the Welfare Boards to
enable such Welfare Boards to undertake social security schemes and
welfare measures for building and construction workers.
6.     Section 2(1)(d) of the BOCW Act defines “building or other
construction   work”  to   mean   the   construction,  alteration, repairs,
maintenance or demolition of or, in relation to, buildings, streets, roads,
railways, tramways, airfields, irrigation, drainage, embankment and
navigation works, flood control works (including storm water drainage
works), generation, transmission and distribution of power, water works
(including channels for distribution of water), oil and gas installations,
electric lines, wireless, radio; television, telephone, telegraph and
overseas communication dams, canals, reservoirs, watercourses, tunnels,
bridges,   viaducts,  aquaducts,    pipelines,  towers,   cooling   towers,
transmission towers and such other work as may be specified in this
behalf by the appropriate Government, by notification, but does not
include any building or other construction work to which the provisions of
the Factories Act, 1948 (63 of 1948), or the Mines Act, 1952 (35 of 1952),
apply.
7.     Under Section 2(1)(e) of the BOCW Act ‘building worker’ means a
person who is employed to do any skilled, semiskilled or unskilled manual,
supervisory, technical or clerical work for hire or reward, whether the
terms of employment be express or implied, in connection with any
building or other construction work but does not include any such

exceeding one thousand six hundred rupees per mensem or
exercises, either by the nature of the duties attached to the office or
by reason of the powers vested in him, functions mainly of a
managerial nature.
8.     Clause (b) of Section 2(1) of the BOCW Act defines ‘beneficiary’ to
mean building workers, registered under Section 12 of the said Act.
‘Contractor’, ‘employer’ and ‘establishment’ respectively have been
defined in Sections 2(1)(g), 2(1)(i) and 2(1)(j) of the BOCW Act set out

19.   The Respondent No.1, M/s CG Power and Industrial Solutions Limited
(formerly known as M/S Crompton Greaves Limited) entered into a
Framework Agreement with UPPTCL for construction of 765/400 KV
Substations, at Unnao, Uttar Pradesh.
20.   By a letter No. 130/ESD-765/2/CGL dated 5 th March 2010, the
Superintending Engineer, UPPTCL, Unnao placed a detailed order on the
Respondent No.1 for construction of 765/400 kV Substation at Unnao on
single source responsibility turn-key basis.          The    scope of the work as
1.1        The scope of this contract, hereinafter called “FIRST CONTRACT”,
covers all works related to design, engineering, manufacturing, testing at
works, supply of all required equipment and material with accessories and
auxiliaries, as detailed in Schedule of Quantities & Prices (Annexure-IV) to
sub-station site. The scope shall also include supply of any other item
necessary for completing the scope of work without any extra cost, if not
specified in above Schedule.
1.2        The “SECOND CONTRACT” shall cover unloading, handling at
site, erection, testing and commissioning of all the equipment and
material to be supplied by the contractor under first contract and any
other work require to complete the scope for commissioning and handing
over the entire sub-station.
1.3 the “THIRD CONTRACT” shall cover all civil works including material to
complete the scope for commissioning and hading over of the entire sub-
station.
1.4        The proposed sub-station shall be constructed as per scope of
work (Doc. No.017806-47ES-0100) under the technical specification
(Volume-II) and the specification drawings enclosed with the REP
document.
1.5        The proposed sub-station will be comprised of following works:
1.5.1      765kV switchyard (one & a half breaker scheme)
a) Two (2), 765kV feeder bays along-with 1x330MVAR shunt reactor in
b) Two (2), 765kV bays for 2x1000MVA Tranformer Bank
c) One (1), 765kV bay for 189MVAR Bus Reactor Bank
1.5.2      400kV switchyard is to be modified to accommodate Two (2),
400kV bays of 2x1000MVA, 765/400kV Transformer Bank in Double Main &
Transformer Bus arrangement.
1.5.3      Electrical / Mechanical Auxiliaries & other Major Misc. works
d) Lighting system for complete switchyard, buildings, streets and stores
e) SDH communication system & PLCC communication
f) AC & DC Auxiliary Power supply system including Batteries, Battery
h) Any other work necessary for completion of sub-station”
Sub-para 5 of the said letter under the sub-heading “Nature of
Contract” clearly provided that the work for the 765kV sub-stations on
single source responsibility, turn-key basis shall be awarded through
FIRST CONTRACT               “Supply and Delivery of Equipment & Material”
SECOND CONTRACT              “Handling, Erection, Testing and Commissioning Works”
FOURTH CONTRACT              “Three years O & M”
21.   In terms of the said Framework Agreement, the work was split, and
covered by four separate contracts.           The first contract was for design,
engineering, manufacture, testing at works and supply of all required
equipment and materials with accessories and auxiliaries, as detailed in
the said contract; the second contract covered erection,                  testing and
commissioning at site including unloading, handling etc.;                    the third
contract covered all civil works including materials for commissioning and
handing over of the Substations and the fourth contract covered
operations and maintenance for three years.
22.    In sub-clause 5 of the said Frame Work Agreement, under the head
“Nature of Contract”, it was clearly stated that the first and second contract shall
cover all works other than civil works required to be completed.           The first
contract covered supply and delivery of all equipment and materials as per
schedule of prices as contained in the concerned contract and any other item
required to complete the scope of work for completion of sub-station including
their performance and guarantees; the second contract covered unloading,
handling at site, erection, testing and commissioning of all the equipment and
material supplied by the contractor under the first contract and any other work
required to complete the scope for commissioning and handing over of the entire
sub-station.    The third contract would cover all civil works including required
materials under its scope.
23.    Four separate contracts were executed by and between UPPTCL and the
Respondent No.1.      There can be no doubt that cess under the Cess
Act is payable in respect of the Third Contract, which covers all
civil works. The first and second contracts, which cover all works
other than civil works, and do not involve any construction, do
not attract cess under the Cess Act.
24.    The penultimate paragraph of Clause 5 of the said Frame Work Agreement
The Contractor shall be fully responsible for the works to be executed
under first three (3) Contracts and any breach or occurrence or default
under one Contract shall automatically be deemed as a breach or
occurrence or default of other Contracts, giving the Engineer absolute
right to take appropriate action under any/all the Contracts including right
to recover damages from any/all the Contracts or terminate any/all the
Contracts. Any such breach or default or occurrence in any of the
Contracts shall not relieve the Contractor of any of his
responsibility/obligation under the other Contracts and no time extension
shall be given to the Contractor on these grounds.                      The
equipment/material to be supplied by the Contractor under the first
Contract when installed and commissioned under the second Contract
shall give satisfactory performance in accordance with provisions of the
Contract. The signing of three (3) separate Contracts shall in no way
dilute the insurance responsibility and obligations of the Contractor.”
25.    The total value of (i) the First Contract (Supply) was 2750933042.00
(Two Hundred and Seventy Five Crores Nine Lakhs, Thirty Three Thousand
and Forty Two), (ii) the Second Contract (Erection) was Rs.40129510.00
(Four Crores One Lakh, Twenty Nine Thousand Five Hundred and Ten), (iii)
the Third contract (Civil) was Rs. 193808465.00 (Nineteen Crores Thirty
Eight Lakhs Eight Thousand Four Hundred and Sixty Five) and (iv) the
Fourth contract (Operations and Maintenance) was Rs.35737200.00
(Three Crores, Fifty Seven Lakhs Thirty Seven Thousand and Two
26.    In this context, it would be appropriate to refer to Clause 6 of the letter
dated 5th March 2010, extracted hereinbelow:-
The sum of Contract values of first, second, third and fourth Contracts for
765/400kV sub-station at Unnao shall be the aggregate Contract value.

(Rupees three hundred two crore six lac eight thousand two hundred seventeen only)
27.    Clause 13 provided that the contract would be governed by the conditions
(a) Special Conditions of Contract (Annexure-II)
(b) General Conditions for supply of Plant & the Execution of work
(c) (i) Technical specification as per volume II, III & IV,
(d) Technical Data Schedule (Guarantee technical particulars, as per

30.  Pursuant to the said First Contract (Supply Contract) the Respondent
submitted two performance bank guarantees on 30 th August 2012, that is
bank guarantee No. 2012/272 issued by Corporation Bank, Mumbai for an
amount of Rs.6092783.00 and bank guarantee No.2012/273 also drawn on
the  Corporation    Bank,     Mumbai     for    an   amount      of   Rs.71068130/-.
Respondent No.1 duly performed the first contract under the framework
agreement that is the contract for supply of equipment along with
accessories and auxiliaries and other related materials and the bills raised
were duly cleared.
31.    Subsequently, there was an audit inspection of the 765 KV
Transmission Division, Unnao for the period from April 2012 to April 2016.
The audit inspection was conducted by the Audit Officer under the Senior
Accountant General during the period from 4th June 2016 to 9th June 2016.
32.   In the Audit Report, the Accountant General pointed out the lapse on
the part of UPPTCL, in not deducting labour cess from the bills of the
contractor, that is Respondent No.1, in respect inter alia of the First
Conract, observing that every employer was required to levy and collect
cess at a rate not exceeding 2% and not less than 1% of the cost of
construction incurred by an employer and to deposit the same with the
Building and Other Construction Workers Welfare Board.
33.   By a letter No.184 dated 2nd September 2016, the Executive
Engineer of the Petitioner, informed the Respondent No.1 of the objection
raised in the Audit Inspection Report regarding non deposit of Labour Cess
on the First Contract. It was contended that 1% Labour Cess was to be
collected from the contractor on the project cost, which would include
supply of equipment and materials as well as erection work.            The
Respondent No.1 was also informed that simple interest was chargeable
on Labour Cess at the rate of 2% per month.
34. By a letter dated 14th September 2016, the Respondent objected to
the imposition of Labour Cess computed at 1% of the total cost of
construction, stating that for the purposes of the first contract, the
company was not covered under the definition of contractor under the
Act.   Thereafter, by a letter dated 27 th September 2016, the UPPTCL
advised the Respondent No.1 to seek opinion of the Labour Commissioner
on the applicability of Labour Cess.
35.    By a letter dated 14th November 2016, the Respondent No.1 sought
the opinion of the Labour Commissioner on the applicability of Labour
Cess on the cost of supply of equipment and materials, contending that
Labour Cess was not payable under the Cess Act or the BOCW Act on
supply of equipment and materials.
36.    The Respondents also made representations to the UPPTCL for
setting aside the demand for cess alleged to be outstanding, on the
ground that the first contract was exempted from cess under the BOCW
Act and the Cess Act 1996.
37.    UPPTCL did not release the Performance Bank Guarantee of Rs.7
crore odd furnished by the Respondent No.1, to secure recovery of an
amount of Rs.2.6 crores towards cess.           Later, the Respondent No.1
extended the validity of the bank guarantee until 30 th November, 2018,
and further extended the bank guarantee till February 2019.
38.    In  the   meanwhile,   by   a   letter  dated    1st  June  2018,   the
Superintending     Engineer,   UPPTCL    informed     the   Respondent    No.2
Corporation Bank that consequent upon successful performance of the
transformer and isolators supplied by the Respondent No.1, the bank
guarantees against the first (supply) contract were partly discharged as
detailed in the said letter.   The   Bank     was  instructed   to  retain  an
amount of Rs.2,60,68,814/- from BG No. 2012/2 dated 30.8.2012 of
Rs.7,10,68,130/- and issue an amended Bank Guarantee extending its
validity.
39.   By a letter dated 29th December 2018, the Superintendent Engineer
of the UPPTCL requested the Executive Engineer, Unnao to recover labour
cess for the supply part of the composite contract from the pending bills
of the Respondent No.1 and, in case any amount still remained
outstanding, to deduct such amount by encashment of the Performance
Bank Guarantee for Rs.2,60,68,814/- held to secure the payment of labour
cess.
40.   On or about 3rd January 2019, the Respondent filed a Writ Petition
M/B No.125 of 2019 before the Lucknow Bench of the Allahabad High
Court, challenging the said communications. In or about February 2019,
while the writ petition was pending, the Executive Engineer, Unnao
purported to deposit Rs.38,38,104/-        with the Building and other
Construction Workers Welfare Board (BOCWWB) as part payment towards
labour cess.
41.    By an interim order dated 7th January 2020, the Hon’ble High Court
restrained the UPPTCL from encashing the bank guarantee. The question
of law as to whether cess would be payable in respect of supply of
equipment by the Respondent no.1 to UPPTCL was kept open.
42.   UPPTCL filed a Counter Statement to the writ petition and the
Respondent filed a Rejoinder thereto contending that the provisions of the
BOCW Act were not applicable to the Supply Contract and levy and
deduction of labour cess in respect of the Supply Contract, was not
permissible in law.      UPPTCL did not take any objection to the
maintainability of the writ petition on the ground of existence of an
alternative remedy, as is evident from its Counter Statement/Affidavit filed
in the High Court.
43.   By the impugned order dated 24 th February 2020, the High Court set
aside the letters dated 2nd September, 2016 and 29th December, 2018
sent by the Petitioner to the Respondent demanding outstanding labour
cess amounting to Rs.2,60,68,814/- computed at the rate of 1% of the
contract value.
44.   The High Court accepted the submission of the Respondent No.1
that   in   the  absence     of  levy   and   assessment   under     the
Cess Act 1996 and the Rules made thereunder, the letters of the UPPTCL
were not sustainable in law. Cess could only be recovered in the manner
stipulated in the Cess Act and the Rules framed thereunder.       The High
Court observed that if cess were leviable under the Cess Act, it would be
necessary for the concerned authorities to undertake the exercise of
assessment and levy of cess under the Cess Act of 1996 as amended,
before the same could be realized from a contractor.      The High Court
found that in the absence of any order for levy and assessment under the
Cess Act of 1996 recovery could not be made pursuant to an audit
objection of CAG.
45.   There does not appear to be any provision in the first contract,
second contract, third contract, or fourth contract or in the Special
Conditions of Contract or the General Conditions for Supply of Plant and
the Execution of work     which enables UPPTCL to withhold any amount
from the bills raised by the Respondent No.1 on UPPTCL towards any
taxes, cess or any other statutory dues of the contractor.             Nor has the
UPPTCL adverted to any specific provision of the contract which enables
UPPTCL to do so.      Clause 8.1 of the Special Conditions of Contract relied
upon by UPPTCL reads that the prices of imported items, if any, shall be
inclusive of all taxes, duties, licence fees, import/customs duties etc.
legally payable. Any such taxes, duties levies shall be on Contractor’s
account and no separate claim on the Account shall be entertained by the
purchaser.     This clause does not authorize UPPTCL to deduct taxes etc.
from bills.
46.   Clauses 24, 25 and 26 of the General Conditions for Supply of Plant
and Execution of Works to the UPPTCL provide as follows:-
“24.Deduction from Contract Price :-            All costs, damages or
expenses, which the Purchaser may have paid, for which under the
Contract, the Contractor is liable, may be deducted by the purchaser from
any money due or which may become due by him to the Contractor under
Contract or may be recovered by suit or otherwise from the Contractor.
Any sum of money due and payable to the Contractor (including
security deposit returnable to him) under this Contract may be
appropriated by the Purchaser and set off against any claim of the
Purchaser for the payment of a sum of money arising out of or under any
contract made by the Contractor, with the Purchaser.
25.       Terms and Payment:- 21 (1) subject to deduction which the
Purchaser may be authorized to make under the Contract or subject to
any additions or deductions provided for under Clause 12, the Contractor
(a)Eight percent of the F.O.R. Contract Value of the plant in rupees on
receipt by the Purchaser of the Contractor’s invoice giving the number
and date of railway receipt covering the dispatch of the plant from the
Indian Port and of the advise note giving case number and contents,
together with a certificate by the Contractor to the effect that the plant
detailed in the said advise note has actually been dispatched under the
said railway receipt and that the Contract value of the said plaint so
dispatched is not less than the amount entered in the invoice.
(b)Ten percent of the F.O.R. Contract value of the plant on satisfactory
completion of test an taking over of the plant.
(c) Ten percent of the F.O.R. Contract value of the plant at the end of
Twelve months from the date of taking over.
(d)For the erection of the plant and proportion of the progress of the work
on the receipt by the Purchaser of monthly invoices submitted by the
Contract supported by the certificates of the Engineer.
If at the time at which either of the instalments due under sub-clause
(b) and (c) of Clause (1) hereof become payable there are minor defects in
the plant which are not of such importance as to affect the full
commercial use of the plant then the Purchaser shall be entitled to retain
only such part of the instalment then due as represents the cost of
making good such minor defects and any sum so retained shall, subject to
the provisions of Clause 36, become due upon such minor defects being
made good.
If the Purchaser desires that the plant or any portion thereof should not
be dispatched by the Contractor when it is due for dispatch, the
Contractor shall store such plant or portion at his works and be
‘responsible’ for all risk. For such storage the Purchaser shall pay to the
Contractor at a rate to be mutually agreed upon between the parties, but
not exceeding 5s (five Shillings) per ton per week payable quarterly, plus
interest at one percent per annum above the current rate of the State
Bank of India on 80% of the Contract value of the plant or portion thereof
so stored, for the period from the date on which the said plant or portion
becomes, due and is ready for shipment upto the date on which it is
actually shipped.
(A)         In the event of the Supplier/Contractor/Company not being able
to supply the materials or to carry out works in accordance with the terms
of this Contract, the Government/Purchaser/Owner shall have the right to
recover any sum advanced in accordance with the Clause 25 from the
Supplier/Contractor/Company and from his/its assets.
26.         Provisional Sums :-        In any case where the Contract price
includes a provisional sum to be provided by the Contractor for meeting
the expenses of extra work or for work to be done or materials to be
supplied by a sub-Contractor, such sum shall be expended or used, either
wholly or in part, or be not used at the discretion of the Engineer and
entirely as he may decide and direct. If no part or only a part thereof be
used, then the whole or the part not used, as the case may be, shall be
deducted from the Contract price. If the sum used is more than such
provision, the Contractor shall pay the excess. In the case of the
materials supplied or work done by a sub-Contractor, the total of the net
sum paid to the sub-Contractor on account of such materials or work and
a sum equal to 10 % of such net sum allowed as Contractor’s profit shall
be deemed to be sum used. None of the works or articles to which sum
of money refers shall be done or purchased without the written order of
the Engineer. The Contractor shall allow the sub-Contractors every facility
for the supply of materials or execution, of their several works
simultaneously with his own, and shall, within fourteen days after the
Engineer has requested him in writing to do so, pay the dues of such sub-
Contractors on account of such materials or work: PROVIDED ALWAYS
that the Contractor shall have no responsibility with regard to such works
or articles unless he shall have previously approved the sub-Contractor
and\or the material or plant to be supplied.”
47.    It is nobody’s case that Respondent No.1 has committed any breach
or default in performance of the First Contract, that is, the Supply
Contract, rendering it liable for any damages, costs or expenses.                 The
Respondent No.1 duly discharged its obligations under the First Contract
(Supply Contract) to the satisfaction of UPPTCL, and accordingly all
payments due to it were cleared. The Performance Guarantees furnished
by the Respondent No.1 were also partially discharged except to the
extent of covering cess on the First (Supply) contract. This is apparent
from the communication of the UPPTCL dated 1st June 2018 to the Bank
(Respondent No.2), referred to above.
48.    As observed above, Clause 8 of the Special Conditions of the
Contract merely says that duties, taxes, fees etc. as are legally applicable,
shall be paid at actuals by the contractor. This clause does not enable
UPPTCL to withhold payments or to realize cess by revocation of a
49.    In Dewan Chand Builders and Contractors vs. Union of India
reported in (2012) 1 SCC 101, this Court examined the object of the BOCW
Act of welfare of workers engaged in building and construction work, and
“The background in which the BOCW Act was enacted, is set out in the
Statement of Objects and Reasons appended to the Bill preceding its
enactment. To better appreciate the legislative intent, it would be instructive
to refer to the following extract from the Statement of Objects and Reasons:
It is estimated that about 8.5. Million workers in the country are engaged
in building and other construction works. Building and other construction
workers are one of the most numerous and vulnerable segments of the
unorganized labour in India. The building and other construction works are
characterized by their inherent risk to the life and limb of the workers. The
work is also characterized by its casual nature, temporary relationship
between employer and employee, uncertain working hours, lack of basic
amenities and inadequacy of welfare facilities. In the absence of adequate
statutory provisions, the requisite information regarding the number and
nature of accidents is also not forthcoming. In the absence of such
information, it is difficult to fix responsibility or to take any corrective
action.
Although the provisions of certain Central Acts are applicable to the
building and other construction workers yet a need has been felt for a
comprehensive Central Legislation for regulating their safety, health,
5. A fairly long preamble to the BOCW Act is again indicative of its purpose. It
"An Act to regulate the employment and conditions of service of building
and other construction workers and to provide for their safety, health and
welfare measures and for other matters connected therewith or incidental
7. The Statement of Objects and Reasons to the BOCW Act explained that it had
been considered ‘necessary to levy a Cess on the cost of construction incurred
by the employers on the building and other construction works for ensuring
sufficient funds for tthe Welfare Boards to undertake the social security
Schemes and welfare measures.’ Simultaneously with the enactment of the
BOCW Act, the Parliament enacted the Cess Act. The Statement of Objects and
Reasons to the Cess Act noted that the intention was to ‘provide for the levy
and collection of a Cess on the cost of construction incurred by the employers
for augmenting the resources of the Building and Other Construction Workers'
Welfare Boards constituted by the State Governments under the Building and
Other Construction Workers (Regulation of Employment and Conditions of
8. It is manifest from the overarching schemes of the BOCW Act, the Cess Act,
the Rules made thereunder that their sole object is to regulate the employment
and conditions of service of building and other construction workers,
traditionally exploited sections in the society and to provide for their safety,
health and other welfare measures. The BOCW Act and the Cess Act break new
ground in that, the liability to pay Cess falls not only on the owner of a building
or establishment, but under Section 2(i)(iii) of the BOCW Act ‘in relation to a
building or other construction work carried on by or through a contractor, or by
the employment of building workers supplied by a contractor, the contractor.’
The extension of the liability on to the contractor is with a view to ensure that,
if for any reason it is not possible to collect Cess from the owner of the building
at a stage subsequent to the completion of the construction, it can be
recovered from the contractor. The Cess Act and the Cess Rules ensure that
the Cess is collected at source from the bills of the contractors to whom
payments are made by the owner. In short, the burden of Cess is passed on
from the owner to the contractor.
50.    In Lanco Anpara Power Limited v. State of Uttar Pradesh and
Ors. Repored in (2016) 10 SCC 329, this Court held:-
“37. We now advert to the core issue touching upon the
construction of Section 2(1)(d) of the BOCW Act. The argument of
the appellants is that language thereof is unambiguous and literal
construction is to be accorded to find the legislative intent. To our
mind, this submission is of no avail. Section 2(1)(d) of the BOCW Act
dealing with the building or construction work is in three parts. In the
first part, different activities are mentioned which are to be covered
by the said expression, namely, construction, alterations, repairs,
maintenance or demolition. Second part of the definition is aimed at
those buildings or works in relation to which the aforesaid activities
are carried out. The third part of the definition contains exclusion
clause by stipulating that it does not include “any building or other
construction work to which the provisions of the Factories Act, 1948
(63 of 1948), or the Mines Act, 1952 (35 of 1952), applies”. Thus,
first part of the definition contains the nature of activity; second part
contains the subject-matter in relation to which the activity is carried
out and the third part excludes those building or other construction
work to which the provisions of the Factories Act or the Mines Act
apply.”
51.    The clear statutory scheme of the BOCW Act excludes a supply
contract from within its ambit.           On behalf of the Respondent No.1, it is
pointed out that several public authorities and corporations, such as the
Delhi    Metro     Rail   Corporation       and     Karnataka    Power      Transmission
Corporation Limited, have issued instructions that no cess under the
BOCW Act is leviable on a contract for supply of goods. Copies of the
KPTCL circulars dated 22.8.2012 and 28.8.2012 to this effect are annexed
to the Rejoinder of the Respondent no.1 in the High Court.
52.   Under Section 2(g) of the BOCW Act the term ‘Contractor’ means a
person who undertakes to produce a given result for any establishment,
other than a mere supply of goods or articles of manufacture, by the
employment of building workers or who supplies building workers for any
work of the establishment and includes a sub-contractor. The Respondent
No.1 is apparently not a contractor, within the meaning of Section 2(1)(g)
of the BOCW Act in respect of the first, second and fourth contracts. Nor
is the Respondent No.1 employer within the meaning of Section 2(1)(i) of
the BOCW Act.      Section 2(1)(i) of the BOCW Act defines ‘employer’ to
include the contractor in relation to a building and other construction work
carried on by or through a contractor or by employment of building
workers supplied by a contractor.        The Respondent No.1 neither falls
within the definition of ‘contractor in Section 2(1)(g) nor 2(1)(i)(iii) of the
BOCW Act.     Apparently, the Respondent No.1 is not liable to cess in
respect of the First, Second and Fourth contracts.
53.   Cess under the Cess Act read with BOCW Act is leviable in respect of
building and other construction works. The condition precedent for
imposition of cess under the Cess Act is the construction, repair,
demolition or maintenance of and/or in relation to a building or any other
work of construction, transmission towers,         in relation inter alia to
generation, transmission and distribution of power, electric lines, pipelines
etc.   Mere installation and/or erection of pipelines, equipments for
generation or transmission or distribution of power, electric wires,
transmission towers etc. which do not involve construction work are not
amenable to Cess under the Cess Act.           Accordingly no intimation or
information was given or any return filed with the Assessing Officer under
the Cess Act or the Inspector under the BOCW Act in respect of the First
and Second Contracts, either by UPPTCL or by the Respondent No.1.
54.    A contractor who enters into a pure Supply Contract is statutorily
exempted from levy under the BOCW Act. The Contract in question is a
Supply Contract as would be evident from Clause 8.7 of the Special
“The contract shall be a ‘Divisible Contract’ with single point
responsibility, hence no works Contract tax shall be payable and
the Purchaser shall not bear any liability on this account.”
55.    Mr. Ramesh Singh appearing on behalf of the Respondent No.1
submitted and rightly, that the four contracts had been treated as a
singular contract solely for the purposes of responsibility for timely
execution. For all other intents and purposes, including levy of any tax or
fees, the contract for supply was understood by the parties as a separate
and distinct contract.
56.    Mr. Singh pointed out that as per the terms of payment under
Clause 9.1 of the Special Conditions of Contract, the Schedule of
Payments were separate for the supply and delivery of equipment and
materials, totaling to Rs.275,09,33,042.00 as against the total value of the
contract which is Rs.302,06,08,217.00.
57.    Mr. Singh argued that the terms and clauses of the contract made it
amply clear that the first contract was for supply and delivery of
equipment and materials.        It was a pure supply contract, separate and
distinct from civil works contract. The UPPTCL itself understood the Cess
Act as not applicable to the Supply Contract and accordingly did not
deduct cess from the invoices/bills of the Respondent.
58.   As argued by Mr. Singh, the judgment of this Court in Lanco
Anpara Power Limited v. State of Uttar Pradesh and Other reported
in (2016) 10 SCC 329 cited on behalf of UPPTCL is of no assistance to
UPPTCL since the issues of whether cess under the Cess Act was leviable
on a Supply Contract or whether the cost of construction under Section 3
of the Cess Act read with Rule 3 of the Cess Rules included the cost of
supply of equipment were not adjudicated in the aforesaid case.
59.   There can be no comparison between realization of disputed cess by
withholding the bills raised by the Respondent No.1 or by invocation of a
bank guarantee furnished by the Respondent No.1 after release of
payment to the Respondent No.1, and deduction of Income Tax at source
which is a statutory obligation of any person making a payment which
constitutes ‘income’ under Section 192 of the Income Tax Act, 1961.
60.   As observed above, UPPTCL demanded and partly realized cess on
the supply Contract, solely on the basis of report of the CAG.      In our
considered view, in the absence of any adjudication, it was impermissible
for UPPTCL to issue the impugned communication to realize cess solely on
the basis of the report of the CAG.
61.   In Centre of Public Litigation v. Union of India reported in
(2012) 3 SCC 1, this Court held that when CAG report was subject to
scrutiny of the Public Accounts Committee and the Joint Parliamentary
Committee, it would not be proper to refer to to findings and conclusions
contained therein.    In this context, reference may also be made to the
decision of this Court in Arun Kumar Agrawal v. Union of India and
Others reported in (2013) 7SCC 1, where this Court held:-
“56. CAG may be right in pointing out that public monies are to be
applied for the purposes prescribed by Parliament and that
extravagance and waste are minimised and that sound financial
practices are encouraged in estimating and contracting, and in
administration generally.
67. The question that is germane for consideration in this case is
whether this Court can grant reliefs by merely placing reliance on
the CAG's Report. The CAG's Report is always subject to
parliamentary debates and it is possible that PAC can accept the
ministry's objection to the CAG Report or reject the report of the
CAG. The CAG, indisputably is an independent constitutional
functionary, however, it is for Parliament to decide whether after
receiving the report i.e. PAC to make its comments on the CAG's
62.   In Pathan Mohammed Suleman Rehmatkhan v. State of
Gujarat and Others reported in (2014) 4 SCC 156, this Court held:-
“9. We heard Shri Y.N. Oza, the learned counsel for the petitioner
and perused the records, as well as counter-affidavit and reply-
affidavit filed by the parties before the Gujarat High Court. The
entire case of the petitioner is based on the CAG report. The
applicability and the binding characteristics of such report were
considered by the High Court. In Arun Kumar Agrawal case [Arun
Kumar Agrawal v. Union of India, (2013) 7 SCC 1] this Court held as
“68. We may, however, point out that since the report is from a
constitutional functionary, it commands respect and cannot be
brushed aside as such, but it is equally important to examine the
comments what respective Ministries have to offer on the CAG's
report. The Ministry can always point out, if there is any mistake in
the CAG's report or the CAG has inappropriately appreciated the
various issues.”
10. The CAG is a key figure in the system of parliamentary
control of finance and is empowered to delve into the economy,
efficiency and effectiveness with which the departmental authorities
or other bodies had used their resources in discharging their
functions. The CAG is also the final audit authority and is a part of
the machinery through which the legislature enforces the regulatory
and economy in the administration of public finance, as has been
rightly pointed out by the High Court. But we cannot lose sight of
the fact that it is the Government which administers and runs the
State, which is accountable to the people. The State's welfare,
progress, requirements and needs of the people are better
answered by the State, also as to how the resources are to be
utilised for achieving various objectives. If every decision taken by
the State is tested by a microscopic and a suspicious eye, the
administration will come to a standstill and the decision-makers will
lose all their initiative and enthusiasm. At hindsight, it is easy to
comment upon or criticise the action of the decision-maker.
Sometimes, decisions taken by the State or its administrative
authorities may go wrong and sometimes they may achieve the
desired results. Criticisms are always welcome in a parliamentary
democracy, but a decision taken in good faith, with good intentions,
without any extraneous considerations, cannot be belittled, even if
that decision was ultimately proved to be wrong.
12. Reference in this regard may also be made to the judgment
of this Court in Centre for Public Interest Litigation v. Union of
India [(2012) 3 SCC 1 : AIR 2012 SC 3725] , wherein it was held that
when the CAG report is subject to scrutiny by the Public Accounts
Committee and the Joint Parliamentary Committee, it would not be
proper to refer to the findings and conclusions contained therein.
The Court even went on to say that it is not necessary to advert to
the reasoning and suggestions made, as well.”
63.   In this Case, there is apparently no dispute, difference or
controversy between UPPTCL and the Respondent No.1 as to the true
construction, meaning or intent of any part of the conditions of contract or
to the manner of execution or the quality or description or payment for
the same.      Nor is there any dispute as to the true meaning, intent,
interpretation,     construction    or   effect   of  the    clauses   of   contract,
specifications or drawings or any of them. UPPTCL has changed its stand
only after the CAG report.         Cess in respect of of the First Contract has
been deducted only in view of the audit objection raised by the Office of
Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG).
64.    The initial stand of UPPTCL will appear from the relevant portion of
“Management stated in its reply that the labour cess from
supply bills has not been deducted because there was not
involvement of labour in supply of material whereas labour cess
has been deducted from the erection bill. Reply is not tenable
as labour cess will be deducted from the cost of construction
wherein supply of material and erection of work were also
included.
65.   It is true that the General Conditions contain an Arbitration Clause
“Arbitration :- If any dispute, difference or controversy shall at any
time arise between the Contractor on the one hand and the U.P.
Power Transmission Corporation Limited and the Engineer of the
contract on the other hand, the contract, or as to the true
construction meaning and intent of any part or condition of, the
same or as to the manner of execution or as to the quality or
description of, or payment for the same, or as to the true intent,
meaning, interpretation, construction or effect of the clauses of
Contract, specifications or drawings or any of them, or as to
anything to be done, committed or suffered in pursuance of the
contract, or specification or as to the mode of carrying the contract
into effect, or as to the breach of alleged breach of the contract, or
as to any claims on account of such breach or alleged breach or as
to obviating or compensating for the commission of any such
breach, or as to any other matter or thing whatsoever connected
with or arising out of the contract and whether before or during the
progress of after the completion of the contract, such question
difference of dispute shall be referred for adjudication to the
Chairman, U.P. Power Transmission Corporation Limited or to any
other person nominated by him in this behalf and his decision in
writing shall be final, binding and conclusive. This submission shall
be deemed to a submission on arbitration within the meaning of the
Indian Arbitration Act, 1940 or any statutory modification thereof
The Arbitrator may from time to time with consent of the parties
enlarge the time for making and publishing the award.
Upon every or any such reference, the cost of an incidental to the
reference and award respectively shall be in the discretion of the
arbitrator, who shall be competent to determine the amount thereof
or direct the same to be taxed as between solicitor and clients or as
between party and party and to direct by whom and to whom and in
what manner the same shall be borne and paid.
Work under the contract shall, if reasonably, possible, continued
during the Arbitration proceedings and no payments due to payable
by the UPPTCL shall be withheld on account of such proceeding. In
case refusal/neglect by such nominee Chairman, UPPTCL may
nominate another person in his place.”
66.    Even though there is an arbitration clause, the Petitioner herein has
not opposed the writ petition on the ground of existence of an arbitration
clause. There is no whisper of any arbitration agreement in the Counter
Affidavit filed by UPPTCL to the writ petition in the High Court.              In any
case, the existence of an arbitration clause does not debar the court from
entertaining a writ petition.
67.    It is well settled that availability of an alternative remedy does not
prohibit the High Court from entertaining a writ petition in an appropriate
case. The High Court may entertain a writ petition, notwithstanding the
availability of an alternative remedy, particularly (1) where the writ
petition seeks enforcement of a fundamental right; (ii) where there is
failure of principles of natural justice or (iii) where the impugned orders or
proceedings are wholly without jurisdiction or (iv) the vires of an Act is
under challenge. Reference may be made to Whirlpool Corporation v.
Registrar of Trade Marks, Mumbai and Ors. reported in AIR 1999 SC
22 and Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation and Ors. V.
Gayatri Construction Company and Ors, reported in (2008) 8 SCC
172, cited on behalf of Respondent No.1.
68.    In Harbanslal Sahnia and Ors. v. Indian Oil Corporation Ltd.
reported in (2003) 2 SCC 107, this Court allowed the appeal from an order
of the High Court dismissing a writ petition and set aside the impugned
judgment of the High Court as also the impugned order of the Indian Oil
Corporation terminating the dealership of the Appellants, notwithstanding
the fact that the dealership agreement contained an arbitration clause.
69.    It is now well settled by a plethora of decisions of this Court that
relief under Article 226 of the Constitution of India may be granted in a
case arising out of contract.    However, the writ jurisdiction under Article
226, being discretionary, the High Courts usually refrain from entertaining
a writ petition which involves adjudication of disputed questions of fact
which may require analysis of evidence of witnesses. Monetary relief can
also be granted in a writ petition.
70.    In this case, the action of UPPTCL in forcibly extracting building cess
from the Respondent No.1 in respect of the first contract, solely on the
basis of the CAG report, is in excess of power conferred on UPPTCL by law
or in terms of the contract.      In other words, UPPTCL has no power and
authority and or jurisdiction to realize labour cess under the Cess Act in
respect of the first contract by withholding dues in respect of other
contracts and/or invoking a performance guarantee.             There is no legal
infirmity in the finding of the High Court that UPPTCL acted in excess of
power by its acts impugned, when there was admittedly no assessment or
levy of cess under the Cess Act.
71.    Even otherwise, the Cess Act and/or statutory rules framed
thereunder prescribe the mode and manner of recovery of outstanding
cess under the Cess Act. It is well settled that when statute requires a
thing to be done in a particular manner, it is to be done in that manner
alone.    UPPTCL could not have taken recourse to the methods adopted by
it. The impugned communications have rightly been set aside.
72.     In our considered opinion, the judgment and order of the High Court
impugned does not call for inference under Article 136 of the Constitution
of India. The Special Leave Petition is, therefore, dismissed.
