S ON I.A. Nos.15 & 16 of 2021. A
brief narration of the facts that led to filing
of these two applications is pertinent.
Petitioner-Bar Association has filed this
writ petition; it challenges the Government
Order dated 04.09.2021 whereby an
Administrator was appointed to manage
the affairs of the Association; an interim
order of stay came be granted;
subsequently this Court after giving a
wider audience to the Bar handed an
interim order on 20.09.2021 constituted a
comprising of very tall members of the Bar
for conducting the elections on or before
22.12.2021; petitionerâ€™s challenge to this
order in Writ Appeal is stated to have been
negatived by the Division Bench of this
Court, with marginal modification; be that
as it may. 2. The HPC expeditiously held
meetings on the 7th, 8th & 13th days of
October, 2021 and discussed the matter
for undertaking certain essential works
preparatory to the contemplated election;
one of them relates to the preparation of
Provisional Voters List followed by the
Final Voters List; it encountered some
difficulty in its endeavor to accomplish the
holding of election within the period
prescribed by this Court, in view of Bye
Law Nos.33(d) to 33(f) of the
Association; these provisions prescribe
certain time lines for the preparation of
Electoral Rolls, which if adhered to would
render the holding of election within the
prescribed period almost impossible; the
Committee also expresses some
apprehension as to voting rights of certain
members who happen to be members of
other similar Bar Associations, as well; in
the said circumstances these two

applications are moved seeking
clarifications/directions at the hands of this
Court. 3. I have heard learned Sr.
Advocate Mr. Uday Holla graciously
representing the HPC and Mr. D.R.Ravi
Shankar appearing for the petitioner-
Association; I have also heard M/s.
Shetty & H.C.Shivaramu; I have perused
the case papers, the Bye Laws & the
rulings cited at the Bar; I am of a
considered view that the HPC is more than
justified in moving the subject applications,
for the following reasons: (a) The subject
Bye Laws prescribe a timeline for the
preparation of Electoral Rolls which are
essential for conducting the election; if this
prescription is to be literally observed, it is
not possible to conduct the elections on or
before 22.12.2021, as fixed by this Court
vide order dated 20.09.2021 and as
affirmed by the Division Bench in the Writ
Appeal preferred by the petitioner-
Association; as a norm, the elected
representatives cannot continue in the
office beyond their prescribed tenure,
which expired in January 2021; however,
the regular elections could not be
conducted because of COVID-19
Pandemic and the associated restrictions;
this happened in several Bar Associations
in the country. (b) The present Managing
Committee whose tenure has long
expired, has been continued in the office
by way of ad hoc arrangement because of
an extraordinary situation that arose from
COVID-19 Pandemic; this is not permitted
in the Bye Laws that operate in normal
situations, is true; the rigor of the Bye
Laws needs to be relaxed for the very
same reason so that the elections can be
conducted within the period prescribed by
this Court and affirmed by the Division
Bench; an extraordinary situation warrants
31/10/2021, 10:51                                     High Court of Karnataka Official Web Site
an extraordinary measure, as of necessity;
therefore, relaxation sought for by the
HPC to the relevant provisions of the Bye
Laws needs to be and is accorded; in fact,
there is a broad consensus at the Bar in
this regard. (c) There has been broadly a
kind of unanimity between the parties that
the elections need to be conducted on or
before 22.12.2021, a date fixed by this
Court after eliciting the views of cross
sections of the Bar; as already mentioned
above, the order fixing the date having
been substantially affirmed in Writ Appeal
has merged into the Division Bench
judgment; therefore consistent with the
intended accomplishment of the election
within the fixed period, the subject Bye
Laws would yield to a purposive
construction and consequently, the
prescription of timelines of actions
thereunder shall be treated as directory
and as admitting variation in the discretion
of the HPC in the special circumstances;
in fact, this was an inarticulate premise of
the order dated 20.09.2021 of this Court
and of its affirmation in Writ Appeal too; a
view in variance cannot be sustained
without violating the said orders and the
premise on which they are built; it hardly
needs to be stated that the HPC is clothed
with the powers of the Election
Commission to conduct election within the
prescribed period and such powers would
include as of necessity the power to relax
the rigors of timelines. (d) The Bye Laws
of the Association provide for the
membership subject to certain conditions
prescribed therein being complied with;
arguably dual membership, i.e., an
advocate being a member in more than
one Bar Association is not absolutely
barred, although it is restricted and
regulated; the right to vote being a
corollary of the membership, cannot be
31/10/2021, 10:51                                     High Court of Karnataka Official Web Site
taken away except on the grounds
mentioned in Bye Law 35, subject to all
just exceptions; in other words such a
valuable right cannot be denied only on
the ground that an advocate has secured
membership to some other Bar
Association as well; there is no much
scope for an argument to the contrary; (e)

an argument to the contrary. (f) The above
having been said, it needs to be
mentioned that this Court too shares the
view that it is high time to restrict the
voting rights only to the practitioners of law
in Bengaluru Courts or to the advocates
ordinarily residing within the jurisdictional
limits of Bruhat Bengaluru Maha Palike &
however, this is a policy matter which now
cannot be debated before the Court in a
case of the kind, more particularly
because of the embargo enacted in Bye
Law 10(8); this provision arguably
interdicts amendment inter alia to the
provisions of membership and allied
matters after the cut off period, as rightly
contended by Mr. D.R.Ravishankar. (g) Mr.
Uday Holla, learned Sr. Advocate is more
than justified in contending that if the issue
31/10/2021, 10:51                                     High Court of Karnataka Official Web Site
of dual membership associated with voting
rights is taken up for consideration, the
High Power Committee would not be able
to accomplish the holding of elections
within the period prescribed by this Court;
he is also right in telling that the said
matter touches the policy and therefore
the HPC has no mandate even otherwise
to treat it; the Apex Court in
K.SHANTARAJ & ANOTHER vs.
37 has faltered the action of the
administrator in enrolling new members to
the Society in contravention of the extant
Bye Laws there; it is observed therein that
the administrator has only power to
organize election process inter alia in
accordance with the Bye Laws of the
Society; these observations support the
stand taken by the HPC in the subject
applications. With the above observations,
these applications are disposed off,
placing on record a deep appreciation for
the Members of the HPC for sparing their
valuable time for the cause of the Bar
Association. Call this matter for further
hearing on 26.11.2021.
