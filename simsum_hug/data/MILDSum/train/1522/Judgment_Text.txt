2.     Heard Shri Somendra Singh, learned counsel for petitioners
in Writ A No.7783 & 8001 of 2022, Shri Abhishek Kumar
Kushwaha, learned counsel for petitioner in Writ A No.8619 of
2022, Shri Vikram Bahadur Singh, learned Standing Counsel and
Shri Lal Dev Chaurasiya, Advocate holding brief of Shri Avneesh
Tripathi, learned counsel for respondents no.2 and 3.
3.     Learned counsel for parties are in agreement that this writ
petition involves interpretation of legal provision as well as
clauses of advertisement of recruitment process, therefore, writ
petitions could be decided without exchange of pleadings.
4.     All the petitioners are candidates of recruitment process for
the post of Assistant Prosecution Officer Exam - 2022 (Advt. No.
A-3/E-1/2022, dated 21.4.2022).
5.     Shri Somendra Singh, learned counsel for petitioners
submitted that no recruitment process for Prosecuting Officers
could be conducted after 2018 and after four years now in 2022,
present recruitment process is commenced. During 4 years, many
candidates have became over aged and by fixing cut off date for
maximum age of 40 years to be 1.7.2022, respondents have
declined petitioner's legitimate right to participate in the
examination and cut off date for maximum age ought to be
1.7.2021 and in this regard, learned counsel relied upon definition
of 'Year of Recruitment' (Rule 3(I) of U.P. Prosecuting Officers
WRIT - A No. - 7783 of 2022
Service Rules, 1991 (hereinafter referred to as 'the Rules, 1991’)
which states that "means a period of twelve months commencing
from the first day of July of a calendar year".
6.    'Age' is defined in Rule 10 of the Rules, 1991 that :-
“10. Age - A candidate for direct recruitment must have
attained the age of twenty one years and must not have
attained the age of more than thirty-five years on the first day
of July of the calendar year in which vacancies for direct
recruitment are advertised by the Commission:
Provided that the upper age limit in the case of candidates
belonging to the Scheduled Castes, Scheduled tribes and
such other categories as may be notified by the Government
from time to time shall be greater by such number of yeas as
may be specified."
7.    Clause 11 of Advertisement is also mentioned hereinafter :-
(i) Candidates must have attained the age of 21 years and
must not have crossed the age of 40 years on July 1, 2022
i.e. they must have not been born earlier than 2nd July, 1982
and not later than July 1, 2001. For PH candidates, the
maximum age limit is 55 years i.e. they must have not been
born before 02 July, 1967,
(a) Upper age limit shall be greater by five years for
candidates     belonging  to   Scheduled    Castes    of   U.P.,
Scheduled Tribes of U.P., Other Backward Classes of U.P.,
Skilled players of up classified Games, State Govt.
employees of U.P. including the teachers/Staff of Basic
Shiksha Parishad of U.P. and teachers/Staff of the Govt.
Aided Madhyamik Vidyalayas of U.P. i.e. they must have not
WRIT - A No. - 7783 of 2022
(b) Upper age limit shall also be greater by 3 years + period
of service rendered in army for the emergency commissioned
officers/short     service    commission     officers/Ex-Army
personnels of U.P.
(c) Upper age limit shall be greater by 15 year's for P.H.
candidates of U.P."
8.     Learned      counsel      further    submitted     that     date    of
Advertisement was 21.5.2022, therefore, year of recruitment
ought to be 1.7.2021 to 1.7.2022 and accordingly cut off date for
maximum age ought to be 1.7.2021 and not 1.7.2022. In the
present recruitment vacancies of year 2018-19, 2019-20 are
included and considering petitioners' legal exceptions, writ petition
be allowed.
9.     Shri Abhishek Kumar Kushwaha, learned counsel for other
petitioners submitted that due to Covid-19 Pandemic, examination
was not conducted for almost four years and considering extra
ordinary circumstances, petitioners who are eligible if the cut off
date for 'age' is fixed 1.7.2022 be permitted to appear in
examination and in this regard, he relied upon paragraph 18 and
19 of judgment passed by the Supreme Court in High Court of
Delhi vs. Devina Sharma; (2022) 4 SCC 643, which are
mentioned hereinafter :-
“18 The time schedule for conducting the recruitment process
to the judicial service has been stipulated by the judgment of
this Court in Malik Mazhar Sultan (3) vs Uttar Pradesh Public
Service Commission 6. The object and purpose of the
directions of this Court has been to ensure that the 6 (2008)
17 SCC 703 CA 2016/2022 recruitment process for the
judicial service is conducted on schedule every year, subject
WRIT - A No. - 7783 of 2022
to the rules of each High Court. The High Court of Delhi held
its last examination for recruitment to DJS in 2019.
Admittedly, no examination has been held in 2020 or in 2021.
The examination for 2020 could not be conducted since the
process for 2019 was still to be completed. The examination
for 2020 could not be held due to the onset of the Covid-19
pandemic. In this backdrop, since the examination was not
conducted for two recruitment years, the High Court has after
considering the issue stated before this Court through the
learned senior counsel that as a one-time measure, this
Court may accept the suggestion that candidates who would
have qualified for the examinations were they to be held on
schedule for recruitment years 2020 and 2021 in terms of the
rules as they then stood, may be permitted to appear for the
ensuing examinations.
19 Having regard to the fact that the recruitment examination
for DJS has been last held in 2019 and two recruitment years
have elapsed in the meantime, we are of the view that the
suggestion of the High Court should be accepted for this
year. The consequence of the acceptance of the suggestion
by this Court, would be that candidates who would have
fulfilled the upper age limit of 32 years, for the recruitment
years 2020 and 2021 would be eligible to participate in the
examination for the ensuing recruitment year 2022. The age
bar which they would now encounter is not of their own
volition. The real element of hardship faced by such
candidates has been remedied by the CA 2016/2022 High
Court and there is no reason for this court not to accept the
suggestion. The examination cannot however, be postponed
indefinitely nor can the candidates who have applied be left in
a state of uncertainty. The existing candidates can have no
grievance by the widening of the competition. In order to
facilitate this exercise, we accept the suggestion of the High
Court that the last date for the receipt of application forms
shall be extended to 3 April 2022 and the examination shall
WRIT - A No. - 7783 of 2022
be held on 24 April 2022. We direct that no impediment shall
be caused in the conduct of the examination and no court
shall issue any order of stay at variance with or contrary to
the above directions of this Court."
10.   Shri Lal Dev Chaurasiya, learned counsel for respondent
no.2 submits that advertisement was issued on the direction of
State, therefore, respondent no 2 has no submission on merit,
however, Advertisement was issued on 21.4.2022, therefore,
recruitment year would be 2022-23 and reckoning of date would
be 1 July, 2022, as such, cut off date is rightly fixed.
11.   Shri Vikram Bahadur Yadav, learned Standing Counsel
submitted that first date of July calendar year would be relevant
for the calendar year of recruitment which is 2022-23, therefore,
relevant date would be 1 July, 2022 and not 1 July, 2021 and has
relied upon paragraphs no.48, 68 and 77 of the judgment passed
by a co-ordinate Bench of this Court in the case of Sushil Kumar
Singh and 127 others vs. State of U.P. and othes (Writ A No.4924
of 2021, decided on 24.8.2021) that :-
“48. Petitioners assume that age relaxation would be a natural
consequence of non-holding of recruitment, annually, in terms of
the undertaking given to the Court, and the writ petition is
primarily based on such an assumption, which is wholly
misplaced.
68. Distinction has been drawn between substantive legitimate
expectation and procedural legitimate expectation. In order to
make out a case for substantive legitimate expectation, it will
have to be shown that change in policy is not on account of
changed circumstances or in public interest and that the action
WRIT - A No. - 7783 of 2022
is otherwise arbitrary and unreasonable. In the facts of the
present case it has already been found that State had not acted
arbitrarily and justification exists for not holding annual
recruitment    on  the   post  of   Sub-Inspector   despite  the
undertaking given by State of U.P. before Supreme Court.
77. The State Government has already made Rules of 2015 in
exercise of powers under Clause (c) of Sub-section (2) read
with Sub-section (3) and Section 2 of the Police Act, 1861 which
specifies the age of recruitment and is otherwise not under
challenge. The Writ Court, therefore, cannot issue any
mandamus to the State to relax the upper age limit provided in
Rule 10 in the manner it is prayed by the petitioners. A writ of
mandamus can be issued only when there is in existence a
legal right with corresponding legal duty. Prayer so made has,
therefore, to be rejected. No provision otherwise exists in the
Police Act, 1861 or the Rules of 2015 which empowers the State
to relax the maximum age of recruitment specified in Rule 10."
12.    The advertisement for 2018-19 for A.P.O. was issued on
28.12.2018 and reckoning date was 1 July, 2018, therefore,
relevant is year of recruitment and accordingly, date is fixed.
13.    Heard the counsel for parties, perused the pleadings as well
as written submissions.
14.    Covid-19 pandemic has stalted and affected not only day to
day life of a human being but has affected State's normal working
and an example of it is the recruitment process in question which
is scheduled after four years. Resultantly, petitioners became over
aged according to cut off date i.e. they have crossed the age of 40
years before July 1, 2022 i.e. they are born earlier than 2 nd July.
15.    In the recruitment process, candidate between 21 years to
WRIT - A No. - 7783 of 2022
40 years are eligible to participate and there is no limit of
attempts, therefore, petitioners were eligible to participate in
recruitment held prior to recruitment held in 2018, therefore, the
argument that they have been denied the right of legal
expectation has no force. Considering it was beyond control of the
State, therefore, State cannot be faulted for not conducting
recruitment examination during Covid-19 pandemic.
16.   ‘Year of Recruitment’ means a period of twelve months
commencing for first day of July of a Calendar year(See Rule 3(1)
of the Rules, 1991). 'Age' means that a candidate must not have
attained the age of more than forty years on the first day of July of
Calendar year in which vacancies for direct recruitment are
advertised by the Commission (See Rule 10 of the Rules, 1991).
17.   Assistant  Prosecution    Officer  examination     2018    was
advertised by Advertisement dated 28.12.2018 and cut off date for
maximum age was forced to July 1, 2018 whereas for Assistant
Prosecution Office examination, 2022 (Advertisement dated
21.4.2022), cut off date for maximum age is fixed i.e. 1.7.2022.
The relevant cut off date is fixed according to year of
18.   In Devina Sharma (Supra), age was relaxed on basis of
submission of the recruitment body, therefore, it cannot be treated
to be a precedent. In the present case, State has fixed the cut off
date and being a policy matter not be disturbed or interfered not
being to be 1.7.2022, which has followed earlier pattern arbitrarily.
Similarly reckoning date is fixed according to year to recruitment
and year of advertisement such as in recruitment process for Uttar
Pradesh Police Constable and Head Constable (Advertisement
dated 14.1.2018) and the reckoning date was 1 July, 2008.
WRIT - A No. - 7783 of 2022
19.    It is settled proposition that due to inaction on the part of the
State Government in not filing the posts year-wise. The
candidates cannot get a right to participate in the selection
process being over aged and that no body can claim as a matter
of right that recruitment on any post should be made every year.
State has taken a decision which cannot be interfered except it is
arbitrary which the petitioners have failed to make out a
substantial case.
20.    In the present case, there is no challenge to clauses of
advertisement and reckoning date is fixed in accordance with
Rules considering date of advertisement year of recruitment
considering date of Advertisement to be 21.4.2022, reckoning
date is fixed to be 1.7.2022.
21.    Rule 10 of the Rules, 1999 provides reckoning date for age
will be first day of July of the Calendar Year in which vacancies for
direct recruitment are advertised by the Commission. In the
present      case,    Commission has advertised              on   21.4.2022,
therefore, calendar year would be 1 January, 2022 to 31 July,
2000 and accordingly date would be first day of July of Calendar
year i.e. 1.7.2022. Commission and State have followed the
provisions correctly. Fixing of date cannot be said to be arbitrary.
Petitioners have failed to make out a case for interference.
22.    It will be relevant to quote paragraphs 8, 10 and 11 from the
judgment passed by a co-ordinate Bench of this Court in Vijay
Kumar Singh vs. State of U.P. and others; 2022 (7) ADJ 677 (LB)
while dealing the similar issue held that :-
Further, Rule 6 of U.P. Recruitment to Services (Age Limit)
WRIT - A No. - 7783 of 2022
"Rule 6-Computation of Age.-Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in any service rules, for the services and
posts, whether within or outside the purview of the Public
Service Commission, a candidate must have attained the
minimum age and must not have attained the maximum age,
as prescribed from time to time, on the first day of July of the
calendar year in which vacancies for direct recruitment are
advertised by the Public Service Commission or any other
recruiting authority, or as the case may be, such vacancies are
intimated to the Employment Exchange.
Provided that nothing in this rule shall apply to a case where
such advertisement or intimation has been made before the
commencement of the Uttar Pradesh Recruitment to Services
10. Leared counsel for the petitioner has also placed before
this Court a report of the Calendar Reform Committee of
Government of India, submitted on 10.11.1955. Learned counsel
for the petitioner submits that in the said report the committee
referred to number of calendars in use in India and did not find
favour with the English calendar for use in India and
recommended use of Indian calendar. Therefore, the term
calendar year as used in Rule-10 should not be read as British
calendar but should be treated to be Indian Calendar. Learned
counsel for petitioner further relied upon the judgments of
Supreme Court passed in case of 'Malik Mazar Sultan Vs. U.P.
Public Service Commission' reported in [2006 (9) SCC 507] and
‘Chairman Indore Vikas Pradhikaran Vs. Pure Industrial Coke and
Chemicals Limited' reported in [2007 (8) SCC 705].
11. I have perused the report of the committee.The said report is
only recommendatory in nature. There is nothing to show that the
same was ever accepted and enforced, at any point of time.
There is nothing to show that while drafting or enforcing the
applicable rules, the State Government ever relied upon the said
WRIT - A No. - 7783 of 2022
report or referred to any Indian calendar.The use of the month of
July in rules itself shows that rules refer to the British calendar
and not to an Indian calendar.Therefore, the term 'calendar year'
in which the vacancies are advertised is the year from the 1st of
January to 31st December and,it is the first day of July of the said
calendar year on which the person should not have attained the
age of more than 40 years.The same in the present case is 2022
as the vacancies were advertised on 05.01.2022.”
23.   In view of above discussion and considering the judgment
Vijay Kumar Singh (Supra), I do not find any illegality and
irregularity in fixing of reckoning date in terms of date of
advertisement i.e. 1.7.2022. Accordingly, the present writ petition
is dismissed.
