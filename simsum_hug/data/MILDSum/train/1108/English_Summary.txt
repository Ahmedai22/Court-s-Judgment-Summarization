As per the Medical Termination of Pregnancy (Amendment) Rules, 2021, the following categories of women shall be considered eligible for termination of pregnancy under clause (b) of subsection (2) Section 3 of the Act, for a period of up to twenty-four weeks, namely:-

Further, the new rules make the formation of a state-level medical board mandatory, to decide if a pregnancy could be terminated after 24 weeks in cases of foetal malformation. It would be mandatory for it to provide its opinion on the termination of pregnancy within three days of receiving the request for medical termination of pregnancy.
Earlier, abortion was possible with the opinion of one doctor in affirmation if it is done within 12 weeks of conception, and 2 doctors, if abortion had to take place between 12 and 20 weeks.
Further, the rules make it mandatory for the Board to ensure that the termination procedure, when advised by the Medical Board, is carried out with all safety precautions along with appropriate counselling within five days of the receipt of the request for medical termination of pregnancy
