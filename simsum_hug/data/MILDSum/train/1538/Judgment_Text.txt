1.      The petitioner (hereafter ‘the assessee’) has filed the
present petition under Article 226 / 227 of the Constitution of India
impugning a notice dated 31.03.2021 (hereafter ‘the impugned
notice’) under Section 148 of the Income Tax Act, 1961 (hereafter
‘the Act’). By the impugned notice, the assessee was called upon
to file the return of income for the relevant assessment year within
a period of thirty days from the said date, on the ground that his
income chargeable to tax, for the Assessment Year 2016-17, has
escaped assessment within the meaning of Section 147 of the Act.
2.      The Assessing Officer (hereafter ‘the AO’) believed that a
part of the assessee’s income, by way of capital gains resulting
from the sale of property at Vasant Vihar, had escaped assessment.
By:Dushyant Rawal       W.P.(C) No.13918/2022                                         Page 1 of 19
It is the assessee’s case that his return of income duly disclosed the
transaction regarding sale of property and the computation of
capital gains resulting from the said transaction. The assessee’s
return was picked up for scrutiny and his income was assessed
under Section 143(3) of Act. The AO did not accept the assessee’s
computation and recomputed the capital gains. The assessee, thus,
claims that the impugned notice, in effect, seeks to re-examine the
assessment, which is impermissible.
3.      The only question that arises for consideration in this
petition is whether the issue of the impugned notice is occasioned
by a possible change of opinion and seeks to review the assessment
order.
4.      The controversy in the present case relates to the assessment
of income by way of long-term capital gains arising from sale of
immovable property bearing no. A-53, Vasant Marg, Vasant
to the assessee, the Property belonged to his parents in equal share.
He acquired the Property by virtue of a will dated 17.06.1999
(hereafter ‘the Will’) executed by his father, late Sh. B.S. Ramdas
Kapoor and by virtue of a Gift Deed dated 10.02.2006 (hereafter
‘the Gift Deed’) executed by his mother Mrs. Achla Kapoor. The
assessee sold the said Property at a consideration of
₹60,00,00,000/- (Rupees Sixty Crores Only) and it was conveyed
to the Vendee by a Sale Deed executed on 28.04.2015.
5.      One of the sisters of the assessee instituted a suit in this
Court [being CS(OS) No.1176/2007 captioned Mrs. Meera
Dhingra v. Mr. Deepak Kapoor & Ors.], claiming share in the
assets (including the Property), which the assessee claimed were
By:Dushyant Rawal       W.P.(C) No.13918/2022                                       Page 2 of 19
inherited/received from his parents by virtue of the Will and the
Gift Deed. In the said proceedings, this Court passed certain
orders directing status quo in respect of the suit assets (including
the Property).
6.      The assessee and his siblings settled their disputes in terms
of a settlement deed, whereunder the assessee agreed to pay each
of his three siblings a sum of ₹6,40,00,000/- (Rupees Six Crores
Forty Lacs Only) and they agreed not to contest the Will and the
7.      The aforementioned suit was decreed in terms of the said
settlement by an order dated 25.02.2015 passed by this Court.
8.      The assessee filed his return of income for the Assessment
Year 2016-17 on 30.06.2016, declaring a total income of
Seventy-one Thousand Four Hundred and Nineteen Only). The
same included a sum of ₹25,86,67,241/- as capital gains arising
from the sale of the Property.
9.      In the computation of income filed along with the return, the
assessee claimed ₹11,06,66,759/- as costs of acquisition of the
Property, being the fair market value as on 01.04.1981, enhanced
on the basis of Inflation Index published by the Income Tax
Authorities for the said purpose. The assessee also claimed a sum
of ₹19,20,00,000/- paid to his three sisters in terms of the
settlement as decreed, as expenditure incurred wholly and
exclusively in connection with the Property. In addition, the
assessee also claimed brokerage and other charges amounting to

10.     The assessee’s return was picked up for scrutiny and the AO
issued a notice dated 06.07.2017, under Section 143(2) of the Act,
inter alia, stating that the following two issues have been
identified for examination:
“i.   Whether receipt of foreign remittance has been
correctly offered for tax.
ii.   Whether capital gains / loss is genuine and has
been correctly shown in the return of income.”
11.     Subsequently, on 06.09.2018, the AO issued another notice
under Section 142(1) of the Act seeking further information, inter
alia, regarding long-term capital gains (Schedule CG of ITR).
This was followed by another notice dated 03.12.2018 under
Section 142(1) of the Act, inter alia, calling upon the assessee to
provide the following information:
“1. Please provide the copy of valuation report
showing the value (land cost, cost of
construction and cost improvement) which
was taken by you as on 01/04/1981 for the
purpose of computation of capital gain.
2.    Please provide the documentary evidence (in
support of land cost, cost of construction and
cost improvement) submitted by you before
the registered valuer, who has under taken
the valuation of the property.”
12.     The assessee responded to the aforesaid notice by a letter
dated 12.09.2018, enclosing therewith the various documents
including the Will dated 17.06.1999; the Gift Deed dated
10.02.2006; the order dated 25.02.2015 passed by this Court in
CS(OS) No.1176/2007; Agreement to Sell dated 28.04.2015;
calculation of capital gains; and Certificate under Section 197 of
the Act.

13.     During the course of the assessment proceedings, the
assessee filed a letter dated 07.12.2018 enclosing therewith copy
of the Valuation Report regarding the fair market value of the
Property as on 01.04.1981. The assessee also set out the details of
the expenses incurred in connection with the transfer of the
Property. The relevant extract of the said letter is set out below:
“Expenses incurred in connection with Transfer:-
The assessee has claimed following expenses incurred in
connection with transfer:
Court order for for perfecting the   Rs.19,20,00,000/-
title and be the absolute owner of
b. Legal expenses for above purposes    Rs.2,74,30,000/-
c. Brokerage on sale                    Rs.1,12,36,000/-
With regard to the amounts paid to sisters, the assessee
submits that the property was succeeded by Mr. Deepak
Kapoor after the death of his father under will dated
17.06.1999 and also via gift deed dated 10.02.2006 from
his mother. For selling the property, in 2007, the assessee
filed petition u/s 276 of the Indian Succession Act for
grant of Probate of will dated 17.06.1999 executed by his
father before the Hon’ble Court of District Judge, Delhi.
One of the sister of assessee namely Mrs. Neelam Amin
duly filed ‘No Objection’ in relation to the execution of
the will.
However, one sister namely Mrs. Meera Dhingra filed a
suit for declaration, partition, possession etc. before the
Hon’ble High Court of Delhi against assessee in respect
of the assets left behind by the parents of assessee which
is also supported by two other sisters of the assessee
namely Mrs. Vijay Girdhar and Mrs. Deepika Batra who
also staked to a share in property which is subject matter
for the year under consideration. Thus the WILL was
under challenge.
As a result of the above claim of the sisters, the Hon’ble
High Court passed order of injunction restraining the sale
By:Dushyant Rawal       W.P.(C) No.13918/2022                                       Page 5 of 19
of said property on 12.07.2007 and 08.04.2009. Copy of
the orders has already been filed by assessee. As a result
of the above injunction, the assessee could not sold its
property.
The assessee was following through his advocates
however could not get the order removing injunction.
Ultimately in year 2014, the above said case was
amicably settled / compromised between the assessee and
his sisters wherein the sisters agreed to make the assessee
absolute and exclusive owner of the said property against
a consideration of Rs.6.40 cr. to each for three sisters
namely Mrs. Meera Dhingra, Mrs. Vijay Girdhar and
As a result of the above settlement, the Hon’ble Delhi
High Court on 07.11.2014 passed order in which the
injunction was vacated by the Court and the assessee was
permitted to enter into an agreement to sell with any
prospective buyer as a condition that assessee has to pay
/ deposit before Court, the total sum of Rs.19.20 crs.
payable to three sisters on or before 28.02.2015.
After the above Court order, the assessee entered into an
agreement to sale with M/s Hind Samachar Ltd. for a
consideration of Rs.60 crs. Out of the said consideration,
the buyer i.e. M/s Hind Samachar Ltd. deposited three
demand drafts for Rs.6.40 crs. each in favour of three
sisters before the Court. Copy of letter from buyer, M/s
The Hind Samachar Limited in enclosed.
With regard to the above proceedings, the assessee has
incurred legal expenses to get the property title free from
all injunctions and claims and encumbrances after which
only the assessee was able to sell the property that too
after a long gap of 8 years i.e. from 2007 to 2015. The
sale deed in the recital has elaborately mentioned the
above said facts. Further the assessee has paid brokerage
/ commission to the broker for services rendered in
connection with arranging / managing the sale
transactions. Copy of relevant payment details are
enclosed.
In the return of income, the assessee has shown total sale
consideration of Rs.60 crs. and claimed the above amount
By:Dushyant Rawal       W.P.(C) No.13918/2022                                       Page 6 of 19
as expenses incurred wholly and exclusively in
connection with transfer for perfecting the title and be the
absolute owner of this property. The amounts paid are
wholly and exclusively related to the transfer of the
property and should be allowed as expenditure u/s 48 of
the Income Tax Act while calculating the capital gains.
Based on the above facts submitted by the assessee, it was
not possible for the assessee to sell the property without
payments of above sum as per the direction of the
Hon’ble Delhi High Court. Therefore the same should be
allowed as expenses incurred in wholly and exclusively
in connection with transfer u/s 48 of the Income Tax
14.     The assessee also referred to various decisions in support of
his contention that he was entitled to claim deduction in respect of
amounts spent to rectify the defects in the title of the Property or
to remove encumbrances. The assessee claimed that the amount
paid by him to his siblings pursuant to the settlement as well as
legal expenses incurred to contest the proceedings were liable to
be deducted in computing the long-term capital gains chargeable to tax.
15.     On examination of the statements filed by the assessee, the
AO issued a Show Cause Notice dated 21.12.2018 as the AO was
of the view that the benefit of indexation would be available only
in respect of the assessee’s share of the Property and not on the
amount of ₹19,20,00,000/-, which was paid by the assessee to his
sisters in terms of their inter-se settlement.
16.     The assessee responded to the said show cause notice and
contested the AO’s stand that he was not entitled to the benefit of
indexation in determining the costs of acquisition of the Property.
The AO found that the valuation of the Property as on 01.04.1981
was arbitrary and also obtained copies of the sale deed in respect
of another property in Vasant Vihar, New Delhi, which was sold
By:Dushyant Rawal       W.P.(C) No.13918/2022                                       Page 7 of 19
in the year 1981-82. The AO did not accept the assessee’s stand
that he was entitled to the benefit of indexation in respect of the
entire property. According to him, the benefit of indexation was
allowable only on 68% value of the Property.                   The AO,
accordingly, assessed that the capital gains were higher by
₹9,83,81,624/- as compared to the income declared by the
assessee. Thus, the AO assessed the income chargeable to tax by
making addition of ₹9,83,81,624/-. The operative part of the
assessment order dated 30.12.2018 reads as under:
“5.5. With the above remarks the capital gain is
computed as under:
Less     Indexed cost of acquisition 1,22,85,135/-
1/3rd share (land 1136460 x
Less:    Expenditure      wholly     & 23,06,66,000/-
exclusively in connection with
Less     Declare in ITR                  25,86,67,241
Penalty proceedings u/s 271(1)(c) of the I.T. Act, 1961 is
initiated separately for furnishing inaccurate particulars of
income.”
17.     The assessee appealed the assessment order before the
18.     By an order dated 26.07.2019, the CIT (Appeal) partly
allowed the said appeal. It accepted that the assessee was entitled
to indexation benefit for the entire property, however, it did not
accept the assessee’s valuation as to the fair market value of the
Property as on 01.04.1981.
By:Dushyant Rawal       W.P.(C) No.13918/2022                                         Page 8 of 19
19.     The assessee received the impugned notice dated
31.03.2021 and responded to the same by a letter dated 21.04.2021
stating that his return of income as originally filed be treated as his
return pursuant to the impugned notice. He also sought reasons
for seeking reopening of the said assessment.            After a few
reminders, the AO provided the reasons for seeking re-opening of
the assessment. The said reasons indicate that the AO seeks to
recompute the capital gains at ₹65,72,78,865/- by making a further
addition of ₹30,02,30,000/- which, according to the AO, is income
that has escaped assessment.
20.     Mr. Kaushik, learned counsel appearing for the assessee,
has referred to the various decisions in support of his contention
that re-opening of assessment was not permissible merely on the
ground of change of opinion.
21.     Mr. Kumar, learned counsel appearing for the respondent,
contended that the notice for seeking re-assessment has been
issued on the basis of audit objections. He contends that the same
constitutes tangible material on the basis of which assessments can
be re-opened. He referred to the decision of the Supreme Court in
Commissioner of Income Tax v. P.V.S. Beedies Pvt. Ltd.: 237
ITR 13 SC and contended that an assessment could be reopened
on the basis of any factual information given by the internal
auditors. He submitted that in the present case, the auditor had
pointed out that the income had escaped assessment as the legal
expenses incurred by the assessee in contesting the suit filed by
one of his sisters was not justifiable and should not have been
allowed. He further contended that the amount of ₹19,20,00,000/-
By:Dushyant Rawal       W.P.(C) No.13918/2022                                       Page 9 of 19
paid by the assessee to his sisters could not be claimed as expenses
as the said payments were neither in the nature of costs for
acquisition / improvement nor could be considered as transfer
expenses. He also stated that since the circle rate of the Property
was ₹68,08,00,000/-, the same was required to be taken as sale
consideration in terms of Section 50C of the Act.
22.     At the outset, it is relevant to note that the proposed addition
of ₹30,02,30,000/- is, mainly, on two counts. First, that the circle
rate of the Property is ₹68,08,00,000/- and therefore, the said
amount was required to be taken as sale consideration; and second,
that the expenses claimed are not justifiable.
23.     The issue regarding computation of capital gains arising
from the sale of the Property was identified by the AO for a
detailed examination. The notice dated 06.07.2017, issued under
Section 143(2) of the Act, expressly stated that one of the two
issues identified for examination was whether the capital
gains/loss is genuine and had been correctly shown in the return of
income. By a subsequent notice dated 03.12.2018, the assessee
was called upon to, inter alia, provide details in respect of “Large
long term capital gains [Schedule CG of ITR]”. The assessee
responded to the notices. He explained that the Property was a
family property purchased by his father in the year 1969. He had
acquired the same through his parents. There was some dispute
among the family members regarding his acquisition of the said
Property by the Will executed by his father and the Gift Deed
executed by his mother. In view of the dispute, the Delhi High
Court had restrained sale of the Property. The said dispute was
subsequently resolved. In terms of the settlement, the assessee was
By:Dushyant Rawal       W.P.(C) No.13918/2022                                         Page 10 of 19
required to pay ₹6.4 crores to each of his three sisters. He had,
inter alia, submitted as under:
“The property was subject matter of dispute and
there was restraint from selling the property imposed
by Hon’ble Delhi High Court by an injunction order.
This being the set back the property could fetch was
Rs. 60 crs. from a willing buyer which is considered
as the fair market value of the property.”
24.     The copy of the Agreement to Sell dated 28.04.2015 as well
as the Conveyance Deed was also provided to the AO in response
to his demand for the documentary evidence. The Sale Deed
clearly indicated that the value of the Property at the circle rate
was ₹68,08,00,000/- (Rupees sixty-eight crores and eight lacs
only). Although, the assessment order does not refer to the fact that
the value of the Property as per the circle rate was higher than the
consideration received, it is apparent that the AO had examined
the computation of capital gains, including the question as to the
fair market value of the Property. The assessee had explained
why, according to him, ₹60 crores were required to be considered
the fair market value. It is apparent that the AO had accepted the
said explanation as he did not raise any further query regarding the
same. However, the AO was not satisfied with the cost of
acquisition of the Property and had undertaken a detailed
investigation in that regard including by retrieving information
from the Delhi archives.
25.     Given the nature of enquiry, it is difficult to accept that the
AO had not considered the question of the fair market value.
26.     The cost of assets and expenses in connection with transfer
of the Property and for perfecting title were also subject matter of
a detailed scrutiny during the assessment proceedings.              The
By:Dushyant Rawal       W.P.(C) No.13918/2022                                       Page 11 of 19
assessee was specifically called upon to furnish the documentary
evidence in support of cost of land, cost of construction and cost
of improvement. The assessee had responded to the same by
providing details and the manner in which costs of acquisition had
been computed. He had also claimed the amount of
₹19,20,00,000/- paid by him to his sisters as expenses for
perfecting the title and in connection with the transfer of the said
Property.      In addition, he had also deducted an amount of
₹2,74,30,000/-, being the legal expenses incurred in connection
with the suit instituted by his sisters.
27.      The AO had examined the statements and elaborately dealt
with the question whether indexation was available in respect of
the amount of ₹19,20,00,000/- paid by the assessee to his sisters.
The AO had recomputed the capital gains by making an addition
of an amount of ₹9,83,81,624/- by reducing the costs of acquisition
as claimed by the assessee. The question whether the AO was
correct in accepting that the amount of ₹19,20,00,000/- paid by the
assessee was required to be deducted from the total consideration
received from the vendee, is not material. The principal question
is whether the AO had examined the computation of income by
way of long-term capital gains. Undisputedly, he had.
28.     The assessment cannot be reopened only for the reason that
the AO has changed his view on the question of the fair market
value or whether the amount paid by the assessee to his sisters was
deductible from the total consideration.
29.     In CIT v. Kelvinator of India Ltd.: (2002) 256 ITR 1, a Full
Bench of this Court had held as under:
“14. The scope and effect of the newly substituted
section 147 with effect from April 1, 1989, by the
By:Dushyant Rawal       W.P.(C) No.13918/2022                                    Page 12 of 19
Direct Tax Laws (Amendment) Act, 1987, as
subsequently amended by the Direct Tax Laws
(Amendment) Act, 1989, with effect from April 1,
1989, as also of sections 148 to 152 have been
elaborated in the departmental Circular No. 549,
dated October 31, 1989…..
36. From a perusal of clause 7.2 of the said circular
it would appear that in no uncertain terms it was
stated as to under what circumstances the
amendments had been carried out, i.e., only with a
view to allay fears that the omission of the
expression “reason to believe” from section 147
would give arbitrary powers to the Assessing
Officer to reopen past assessments on mere change
of opinion.
37. It is, therefore, evident that even according to
the Central Board of Direct Taxes a mere change of
opinion cannot form the basis for reopening a
completed assessment.
39. …..A statute conferring an arbitrary power may
be held to be ultra vires article 14 of the
Constitution of India. If two interpretations are
possible, the interpretation which upholds
constitutionality, it is trite, should be favoured.
40. In the event it is held that by reason of section
147 if the Income-tax Officer exercises his
jurisdiction for initiating a proceeding for
reassessment only upon a mere change of opinion,
the same may be held to be unconstitutional. We are
therefore of the opinion that section 147 of the Act
does not postulate conferment of power upon the
Assessing Officer to initiate reassessment
proceeding upon his mere change of opinion.
42. …..An order of assessment can be passed either
in terms of sub-section (1) of section 143 or sub-
section (3) of section 143. When a regular order of
By:Dushyant Rawal       W.P.(C) No.13918/2022                                       Page 13 of 19
assessment is passed in terms of the said sub-
section (3) of section 143 a presumption can be
raised that such an order has been passed on
application of mind. It is well known that a
presumption can also be raised to the effect that in
terms of clause (e) of section 114 of the Indian
Evidence Act judicial and official acts have been
regularly performed. If it be held that an order
which has been passed purportedly without
application of mind would itself confer jurisdiction
upon the Assessing Officer to reopen the
proceeding without anything further, the same
would amount to giving a premium to an authority
exercising quasi-judicial function to take benefit of
its own wrong.”
30.     The said decision was upheld by the Supreme Court in CIT
v. Kelvinator of India Ltd.: (2010) 320 ITR 561. Further, the
Supreme Court observed as under:
“ 5. …..However, one needs to give a schematic
interpretation to the words “reason to believe”
failing which, we are afraid, Section 147 would
give arbitrary powers to the assessing officer to
reopen assessments on the basis of “mere change
of opinion”, which cannot be per se reason to
reopen.
6. We must also keep in mind the conceptual
difference between power to review and power to
reassess. The assessing officer has no power to
review; he has the power to reassess. But
reassessment has to be based on fulfilment of
certain precondition and if the concept of “change
of opinion” is removed, as contended on behalf of
the Department, then, in the garb of reopening the
assessment, review would take place.
7. One must treat the concept of “change of
opinion” as an in-built test to check abuse of power
by the assessing officer. Hence, after 1-4-1989, the
assessing officer has power to reopen, provided
there is “tangible material” to come to the
By:Dushyant Rawal       W.P.(C) No.13918/2022                                        Page 14 of 19
conclusion that there is escapement of income from
assessment. Reasons must have a live link with the
formation of the belief…..”
31.     The assessee had made full disclosure regarding the facts
and circumstances in which the said amount was paid. It is obvious
that the AO had considered the allowability of such deduction. The
AO now seeks to re-assess the assessee’s income on the ground
that the amount of ₹19,20,00,000/- paid by the assessee to his
sisters was not deductible from the sale consideration for the
purpose of computing capital gains. This is clearly a case of
change of opinion.
32.     It is also relevant to note that, in the assessment
proceedings, the assessee had relied on various decisions including
the decision of the Madras High Court in V. Lakshmi Reddy v.
The Income Tax Officer: 241 CTR 364 (Madras), which was also
referred to as a footnote to the statement of computation of income
filed along with the return, in support of his claim that the amount
of ₹19,20,00,000/- paid by him to his sisters was liable to be
deducted from the sale consideration of the said Property. The AO
took the view that the said amount was the share of the assessee’s
sisters in the Property and thus, the assessee was not liable for
indexation benefit while computing the costs of the Property. As
stated above, the assessment order was also appealed before the
33.     In the case of Commissioner of Income Tax-VI, New Delhi
v. Usha International Ltd.: (2012) 348 ITR, this Court had held
“13. It is, therefore, clear from the aforesaid position

(1) Reassessment proceedings can be validly
initiated in case return of income is
processed under Section 143(1) and no
scrutiny assessment is undertaken. In such
cases there is no change of opinion;
(2) Reassessment proceedings will be invalid in
case the assessment order itself records that
the issue was raised and is decided in favour
of the assessee. Reassessment proceedings
in the said cases will be hit by principle of
“change of opinion”.
(3) Reassessment proceedings will be invalid in
case an issue or query is raised and answered
by the assessee in original assessment
proceedings but thereafter the Assessing
Officer does not make any addition in the
assessment order. In such situations it
should be accepted that the issue was
examined but the Assessing Officer did not
find any ground or reason to make addition
or reject the stand of the assessee. He forms
an opinion. The reassessment will be invalid
because the Assessing Officer had formed an
opinion in the original assessment, though he
had not recorded his reasons.”
34.     In the said decision, this Court had also observed that there
may be cases where the AO did not raise the written query but he
may have still examined the subject matter because the aspect and
question may be too apparent and obvious.
35.     In the context of the observations made by the Full Bench
of this Court in Commissioner of Income-tax-VI, New Delhi v.
Usha International Ltd. (supra), this Court in Maruti Suzuki
India Ltd. v. Deputy Commissioner of Income Tax: (2013) SCC
OnLine Del 1930, had observed as under:
"It is apparent from the above extract that even in
cases where no query is raised by the assessing

officer in the course of the original assessment
proceedings it may yet be held that the assessing
officer had examined the subject matter. This is
so because the aspect or question in issue may be
too apparent and obvious. However, the Full
Bench cautioned by stating that such cases would
have to be examined individually. It is, therefore,
clear that even where no query is raised by the
assessing officer and there is no discussion in the
assessment order, it may yet be a case where the
assessing officer would be considered to have
examined the issue. However, we are not
concerned with those type of cases inasmuch as in
the present case the assessing officer had clearly
raised a specific query with regard to bad
debts/advances       written    off    and       the
petitioner/assessee had given details in respect
thereof. It is obvious that since no such addition
was made on that count, the assessing officer had
considered and examined the position and held in
favour of the petitioner/assessee. Therefore, we
can safely conclude that, in the facts and
circumstances of the present case, the assessing
officer had, indeed, examined the issue at the time
of the original assessment proceedings and had
formed an opinion by not making any addition in
respect thereof. Thus, the reopening of the
assessment which had been concluded on
13.03.2006, would be nothing but a mere change
of opinion.”
36.     In Gemini Leather Stores v. Income Tax Officer, ‘B’
Ward, Agra & Ors.: (1975) 100 ITR 1, the Supreme Court held
that where the Income Tax Officer has all the material before him
and has framed the original assessment, it is not open for him to
take recourse to Section 147(a) of the Act to remedy the error
resulting from his oversight. In Indian and Eastern Newspaper
By:Dushyant Rawal       W.P.(C) No.13918/2022                                       Page 17 of 19
Society v. Commissioner of Income Tax, Delhi: (1979) 119 ITR
996, the Supreme Court expressed a similar view and held as
“14. Now, in the case before us, the Income Tax
Officer had, when he made the original assessment,
considered the provisions of Sections 9 and 10. Any
different view taken by him afterwards on the
application of those provisions would amount to a
change of opinion on material already considered
by him. The Revenue contends that it is open to him
to do so, and on that basis to reopen the assessment
under Section 147(b). Reliance is placed
on Kalyanji Mavji & Co. v. CIT [(1976) 1 SCC 985
: 1976 SCC (Tax) 111 : (1976) 102 ITR 287] where
a Bench of two learned Judges of this Court
observed that a case where income had escaped
assessment due to the “oversight, inadvertence or
mistake” of the Income Tax Officer must fall
within Section 34(1)(b) of the Indian Income Tax
Act, 1922. It appears to us, with respect, that the
proposition is stated too widely and travels farther
than the statute warrants insofar as it can be said to
lay down that if, on reappraising the material
considered by him during the original assessment,
the Income Tax Officer discovers that he has
committed an error in consequence of which
income has escaped assessment it is open to him to
reopen the assessment. In our opinion, an error
discovered on a reconsideration of the same
material (and no more) does not give him that
power. That was the view taken by this Court
in Maharaj Kumar Kamal Singh v. CIT [AIR 1959
, CIT v. Raman & Co. [AIR 1968 SC 49 : (1968) 1
SCR 10 : (1968) 67 ITR 11] and Bankipur Club
Ltd. v. CIT [(1972) 4 SCC 386 : 1974 SCC (Tax)
76 : (1971) 82 ITR 831] , and we do not believe that
-the law has since taken a different course. Any
observations     in Kalyanji      Mavji     &     Co.
v. CIT [(1976) 1 SCC 985 : 1976 SCC (Tax) 111 :
(1976) 102 ITR 287] suggesting the contrary do
not, we say with respect, lay down the correct law.”

37.     It is now impermissible for the AO to seek reopening of the
assessment to review its decision regarding the fair market value
of the Property or deduction on account of the amount of
₹19,20,00,000/- paid by the assessee to his sisters or the expenses
incurred by him.
38.     In view of the above, the petition is allowed and the
impugned notice dated 13.03.2021 is, accordingly, set aside. The
pending application is also disposed of.
