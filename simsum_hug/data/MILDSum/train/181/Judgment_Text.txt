2.     The case of the petitioner is that one Activa vehicle of
employee of sister of the applicant was detained by the
concerned Traffic police and as such on 27.1.2022, sister of the
applicant, named as Ms. Rekhaben, went to RTO office, Rajkot
and paid fine of Rs.2000/- and after securing challan from the
said office, sister of the applicant had submitted said receipt
before Jetpur City Police station and thereby got keys of Activa
vehicle     bearing registration    No.GJ-03  MC-1825         from        Mr.
Mahipatsinh who is a police officer and later on, sister of the
applicant went to police ground with Mr. Saijadbhai and Mr.
Faizalbhai by a Verna car at around 8.45 pm. and thereafter,
applicant supplied all documents and keys to one Mr. Rajubhai
Shamla who is managing the affairs and he informed the sister of
the applicant to wait for some time by indicating that ‘Sir is
coming’. It is the case of the applicant that thereafter, sister of
the applicant, i.e. Ms. Rekhaben called present applicant and
informed her that, ‘you come to police ground and then, we will
go to home together’ and as such, present applicant is said to
have reached the said spot at around 9.15 p.m., where at 9.30
p.m., respondent No.2 namely J.B. Karmur came and without any
complaint or any FIR and without any lady officer, at night hours,
inflicted fist blow to the sister of applicant and when applicant
requested not to beat her sister, i.e. Ms. Rekhaben, Rajubhai and
Karmur mercilessly had beaten the applicant as well though they
were aware about the fact that she is a minor, using stick and
belt brutally, resulting in serious injuries being suffered by
applicant. Said officer is said to have used foul language against
applicant and others and brought all of them to the police station
in a police jeep. Again in the police station, in open space,
respondents had beaten in the midnight and when Saijadbhai
and Faizalbhai requested the officer not to beat both sisters,
then in a double meaning, respondent No.2 used the words,
“sister is for you and not for me” and then again, inflicted injury
on private part of the applicant and thereafter, at around 4.50
a.m., they called one other sister of the applicant and got thumb
mark of the applicant and released the present applicant and her
sister. Due to this, applicant got herself admitted to a hospital
and her sister Ms. Rekhaben also got medical treatment and
later on, applicant came to know that applicant, her sister and
Saijadbhai and Faizalbhai were arraigned as accused persons in
connection with FIR lodged, bearing No.11213022220126 of
2022 dated 28.1.2022 lodged before Jetpur city Police station,
District Rajkot for the offences punishable under Sections 447,
379 and 114 of the Indian Penal Code.
3.     The applicant has further stated that she had not
trespassed anywhere nor committed any theft nor even can
think of breaking lock of vehicle and commit theft in the police
station itself as alleged.
4.     Applicant has submitted that on account this episode,
sister of the applicant, i.e. Ms. Rekhaben, had also approached
the higher officers, but they have not taken any steps. Hence,
applicant is constrained to approach this Court by way of present
contempt petition since there is a gross violation of the mandate
of the directions issued by the Hon’ble Apex Court in the case of
D.K. Basu and Arnesh Kumar (supra).
5.     On notice being issued, the contemners in compliance of
the later order dated 5.4.2022, remained present and through
learned Assistant Government Pleader Mr. K.M. Antani, have
submitted the chronology of events to point out before the Court
that contemners have not acted in the manner as alleged by the
applicant. Such chronology of evens since stated on oath, the
Court would like to reproduce the same hereunder:-
2.1 On 25.01.2022, a scooter of make Honda Activa bearing
registration no. GJ03MC1825 came to be detained for
violating Sections 207, 177 (2) and 181 of the Motors

At this time the answering respondent was on night patrol

possession of the scooter from police custody would

447 and 114 of the Indian Penal Code, was lodged against
Rekhaben Lalitbhai Vegdal amongst other. FIR is annexed
Copy of the said herewith marked as "ANNEXURE R-V".
At the time when Rekhaben Lalitbhai Vegda came to secure
possession of both the vehicles i.e. Access, Honda Active
and Suzuki she was accompanied by the present applicant
as also one Sefaj Sajidbhai Chuutani and Faizal Karim
Jethwa. In FIR being No. 1121302220126 of 2022, the said
Sefaj Sajidbhai Chuutani and Faizal Karim Jethwa were also
arraigned as accused along with Rekhaben Lalitbhai Vegda.
2.6 Sefaj Sajidbhai Chuutani and Faizal Karim Jethwa were
arrested on 23.40 hours whereas, Rekhaben Lalitbhai Vegda
was served upon with a notice under Section 41 of the Code
of Criminal Procedure. A Copy of the notice under Section 41

sister of the applicant). was called to the police station and
the applicant was handed over to Kiran Lalitbhai Vegda.
Copy of the notice of handing over the applicant to Kiranben
Lalitbhai Vegda is annexed herewith and marked as
2.7 Thus, after having followed due process as aforesaid, the
applicant Kiranben Rekhaben was handed Lalitbhai Lalitbhai
over Vegda Vegda to and was allowed to leave the premises
of Jetpur Police Station. CCTV footage of the applicant as
also her elder sister Lalitbhai Vegda i.e. Rekhaben. leaving

are concerned, they were produced before the jurisdictional
Magistrate, where from they were bailed. A copy of the
order of bail dated 29.01.2022 is annexed hereto and
marked as "ANNEXURE R VIII". At this time it shall arise from
the order of the Ld. Magistrate that there is uno discussion
much less a finding of these two complained individuals of
any having custodial violence much less there being a
finding to that effect.
3.    It is most respectfully submitted that the aforesaid
chronology would indicate that due process of law was
followed with respect to the applicant despite the
unauthorized acts committed by Rekhaben Lalitbhai Vegda
(whom the applicant accompanied) for which FIR being No.
1121302220126 has been lodged. It is most respectfully
submitted that an appreciation of the CCTV footage of
27.01.2022 would also that there was neither any injury nor
hurt caused to the said Rekhaben Lalitbhai Vegda much less
the applicant herein.
It can thus be inferred that there been no violation rendered

violation of this Hon'ble Lalitbhai allegations against Court
the that Vegda habitually. of the custodial police authorities
and one such compliant was made before the Dy.
Superintendent of Police, Jetpur Division, Jetpur 27.11.2021.
A copy of the on said complaint is annexed hereto and
marked as "ANNEXURE R-IX". Pursuant to the said
complaint, a report was filed on 15.01.2022 finding that the
allegations made in the said complaint were false and that
the said Rekhaben Lalitbhai Vegda had a mental bent of
filing frivolous complaints against the police Authorities.
Copy of the said annexed report dated herewith 15.01.2022
is annexed herewith and marked as "ANNEXURE R-IX". This
event assumes significance for the reason that one of the
photograph annexed said complaint matches with with
photograph which also forms. to be part of the record of
application raising serious doubts about the veracity of the
photographs annexed with the present application to justify
the allegations made therein.
6.    By pointing out the aforesaid events, Mr. Antani, learned
Assistant Government Pleader, has drawn the attention of this
Court to few Annexures, which are attached to the affidavit-in-
reply, and has submitted that an erroneous impression is sought
to be created before the Court by the applicant by taking
advantage she being a lady. In fact, pursuant to the grievance
voiced out by the sister of the applicant, same was examined at
length by a senior police officer and upon due inquiry, that
applicant’s        sister  has   been       categorically     informed          vide
communication dated 15.1.2022, reflecting on page 99 that her
sister is in the habit of raising very frivolous issues before various
offices of administration and by pointing out wrong assertions,
time and again, and she is in the habit of making such kind of
frivolous       applications    and        therefore,     Assistant           Police
Superintendent          of  Jetpur    had       reported     to     the       Police
Superintendent, Rajkot (Rural), Rajkot that application/ complaint
of Rekhaben Vegada, i.e. sister of the applicant, deserves to be
7.     In addition to this, Mr. Antani has drawn the attention of
this Court to yet another application dated 27.11.2021 filed by
sister of the applicant before Dy.S.P., Jetpur found on page 96 of
present case papers and by referring to paragraph 2, he has
stated that some persons had made attack on her and as such,
by referring to this application, Mr. Antani has submitted that
injury certificates and photographs relates to said incident and a
serious doubt arises about the assault namely whether said
persons are responsible for such injuries sustained by her or it
was caused by the police officers as claimed and it is in serious
controversy. In fact, according to Mr. Antani, the photographs
and injury certificates are not related to the allegations which are
mentioned in the application itself. It has further been submitted
by Mr. Antani that even persons who have been released on bail,
i.e. Mr. Saijadbhai and Mr. Faizalbhai, who accompanied the
sister and the applicant at the police station on being released
on bail, have stated nothing about such assault by the
respondents to the sisters before learned Magistrate when
produced and there is no material to that extent brought before
the Court as well.
8.     Apart from that, even looking at the injury certificates
which are produced would not reflect the correct position by
virtue of which it can safely be inferred that it is only on account
of the respondents, said injury had occurred. The certificates are
merely indicating the assault and one certificate of the
Government Hospital, Jetpur is indicating that Ms. Rekhaben was
brought to the hospital on 28.1.2022 at around 4.30 a.m.,
whereas the next document is dated 29.1.2022 indicates 4.30
p.m. The date of discharge indicates as 28.1.2022 in one
certificate, whereas the date, which is reflecting in the next
certificate is 29.1.2022 at 4.30 p.m. Apart from this, yet another
certificate, which is reflecting on page 8, depicts the history of
injury is on account of collision between two bikes at Jetpur on
28.1.2022 at 5.00 p.m. in the name of Poojaben Vegada and now
claimed by applicant Nathiben as her alternate name. However,
we find there is no reference at all of such alias name anywhere
in the petition having been asserted. This Pooja @ Nathiben even
if it is to be taken as it is, then also, version of applicant cannot
be accepted as injury is said to have sustained on account of
collision between two vehicles. Nothing is stated with respect to
the present incident, as alleged in the application and therefore,
a serious doubt arises about the version which has been
projected before the Court, on the basis of which, according to
Mr. Antani, no definite conclusion can be arrived at about the
guilt of the respondents.
9.      Additionally, learned Assistant Government Pleader Mr.
Antani has submitted that Ms. Rekhaben- sister of the applicant
Nathiben is a lady, having several criminal antecedents in the
area. By submitting a chart, Mr. Antani has given particulars of
the criminal history of Rekhaben and thereby has indicated that
Rekhaben is an accused in 19 offences, at Jetpur and majority
offences are the offences related to Prohibition Act and this is the
activity of Rekhaben who is sister of Nathiben and as such, on
the basis of such kind of conduct also, according to Mr. Antani,
no steps be taken against the respondents when their alleged
conduct is not clearly established.
10. It has further been submitted that grievance of the
petitioner is relating to non-compliance of mandatory directions
issued by the Hon’ble Apex Court and this issue was taken up
very seriously even by the authorities and CCTV footage was also
taken of 27.1.2022 and found such incident having not taken
place. In fact, CCTV footage has been attached with the original
record and brought before the Court for perusal. According to Mr.
Antani, CCTV footage of 27.1.2022 does not indicate either any
hurt caused to said Rekhaben or Nathiben nor indicate anything
by virtue of which, it can be inferred safely that none of the
injuries found on them has been inflicted by these respondents,
who are responsible police officers, and as such according to Mr.
Antani, this is nothing but a serious attempt made by sister of
the applicant to misguide the Hon’ble Court and to deflate the
morale of the police officer and with the background of 19
offences related to Prohibition, Mr. Antani has submitted that
applicant has abused the process of law by bringing such kind of
frivolous application and hence he has prayed that with
exemplary costs, application be dismissed.
11. Having heard the learned advocates appearing for the
parties and having gone through material produced on record, it
appears that incident in question is alleged to have occurred on
account of the vehicle of the employee of sister of the applicant
being detained by the concerned traffic police officer. From the
assertion made by the petitioner herself, that one Activa two-
wheeler was detained by the traffic police officer, as a result of
which, on 27.1.2022, sister of the applicant, i.e. Rekhaben, went
to Rajkot RTO, paid an amount of Rs.2000/- by way of fine and
after obtaining the challan went to Jetpur City Police station,
secured the keys of said Activa, bearing Registration No.GJ-03
MC 1825, then said sister went to the police ground in Verna car
with Mr. Saijadbhai and Mr. Faizalbhai at around 8.45 p.m. and
thereafter, one Rajubhai Shamla, who was managing the affairs
at that point of time, asked the sister to wait for some time and
then, alleged incident of beating took place in which the sister as
well as the applicant both were injured and got medical
treatment         according  to   petitioner.   Simultaneously,            First
Information Report was also lodged on 28.1.2022 against the
applicant as well as sister Rekhaben and those two persons,
named         Saijadbhai    and     Faizalbhai,    being        C.R.         No.
11213022220126 of 2022 before Jetpur Police Station. Now,
narration of the alleged incident, which allegedly took place on
28.1.2022 in the early hours, sister Rekhaben got treatment at
Government Hospital, Jetpur at 4.00 a.m. Page 6 and 7
documents related to Government Hospital, if looked into and
compared with the document of Sanjivani                     Multi-purpose
Specialty Hospital, it would disclose it is an injury certificate
relating to one Poojaben Vegada, who is now stated to be alias
Nathiben, i.e. applicant. It also discloses that she has been
admitted to the hospital on account of the assault. In the column
“History”, it has been recorded as collusion between two bikes
at Jetpur on 28.1.2022. In fact, the allegations which have been
leveled by Rekhaben against Police Inspector, Jetpur Police
Station has been examined by superior authority and upon due
inquiry, a report is submitted by the police officer, which is found
on page 99, revealing that sister of the applicant Ms. Rekhaben
Vegada is in habit of making such frivolous applications time and
again and creating story and also in the habit of disturbing the
administration of the police department. Report also discloses
that to keep the police officials busy, such frivolous applications
are being filed. This has been specifically reported in the said
communication dated 15.1.2022. Keeping in view of conflicting
versions coming from medical records, there is hardly any reason
to rely upon the allegations leveled in the petition.
12. In fact, from the material on record and the affidavit-in-
reply which has been filed by respondent No.2, said sister of the
applicant Rekhaben had unauthorizedly attempted to take
possession of one another vehicle viz. Suzuki Access or in other
words wanted to secure possession of two vehicles, i.e Honda
Activa and Suzuki Access by tendering one receipt, which had
been intercepted for traffic violation offence as well as
prohibition offence respectively. It has been stated on oath that
sister of applicant Ms. Rekhaben Lalitbhai Vegada is having a
criminal history and as many as 19 criminal cases are pending
against her. A tabular chart has been placed on record by
learned Assistant Government Pleader, which this Court deems it
proper to reproduce hereunder:-

13. It has been further found from the affidavit that the
grievance about the alleged incident was also examined by the
higher authority and for arriving at such conclusion, even CCTV
footage of 27.1.2022 has also been considered by the authority
in which it was found that there was neither any injury nor any
hurt caused to said Rekhaben Lalitbhai Vegada, much less the
present applicant and as such, probability of being injured in
vehicular collusion, cannot be ruled out, as found from the
medical certificate of the applicant. Said certificate at Page 8 of
the petition compilation is the history, reflecting collusion
between two bikes at Jetpur. Hence, we are of the view that the
version put up by the petitioner is not possible to be accepted as
14. From the stand taken by the authority, sister of the
applicant namely Ms. Rekhaben Lalitbhai Vegada was also
served with a notice under Section 41 of the Code of Criminal
Procedure and applicant Nathiben, being minor, was handed over
to Kiran Lalitbhai Vegada, another sister, and at the very same
time, Rekhaben was also allowed to go, which fact is also noticed
from the CCTV footage. One more additional fact which we
cannot ignore is the fact that sister of the applicant Ms.
Rekhaben was accompanied by two other persons namely Mr.
Saijadbhai and Mr. Faizalbhai, who had released on bail, and
upon specific query being raised, it has been pointed out in reply
that said two persons have not pointed out to any authority
about occurrence of any such incident. On a conjoint reading of
the assertion made by respondents in their reply affidavit
coupled with the documents as well as stand taken by the
authority, we are of the concerned opinion that it is not possible
for this Court to arrive at a definite conclusion that alleged act
which has been attributed against the officers can be construed
as having occurred. The report submitted by the senior officer to
the concerned Superintendent of Police of Rajkot, CCTV footage
of 27.1.2022 and history given while taking treatment would not
inspire any confidence in this Court to accept the version put
forth by the petitioner. As a result, we are not inclined to
entertain the present contempt proceedings as no definite case
is made out by the applicant. This is more so when there is a
clear report about habitual conduct of Ms. Rekhaben of making
such kind of frivolous applications time and again to keep the
police officer busy in such kind of applications and having a track
record of several prohibition offences, 19 in numbers, pending
against applicant’s sister, we deem it proper not to encourage
such stand of the applicant. Hence, in absence of any definite
material, we are not inclined to exercise contempt jurisdiction.
15. It is trite law that initiation of contempt proceedings is a
serious step; same cannot be exercised in a routine manner.
Unless there is a definite material and clear case made out, this
Court would refuse to exercise contempt jurisdiction. In case on
hand, no clear case appears to have been made out to safely
conclude that acts of the respondents would amount contempt.
Hence, in the absence of any positive material, we are not
inclined to entertain the present application. No-doubt, the
proposition canvassed by the Hon’ble Apex Court is salutary,
must be observed strictly but, the case on hand is reflecting no
definite violation. Hence, we deem it proper not to encourage the
present stand of the applicant and in the peculiar background of
facts, present Misc. Civil Application stands DISMISSED with no
order as to costs. Notice is discharged.
