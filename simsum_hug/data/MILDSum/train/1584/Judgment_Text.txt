3.     The Petitioner challenges the reopening of the assessment
for the Assessment Year (AY) 2012-13, inter alia, on the ground
that there was no failure on the part of the Petitioner to disclose
fully and truly all material facts necessary for its assessment for
that Assessment Year, and, therefore, no notice for reopening the
assessment could have been issued after the expiry of four years
from the end of the relevant Assessment Year.
4.     The Assessing Officer (AO) issued the impugned notice
dated 29.03.2019 under Section 148 of the Income Tax Act,
1961 (IT Act), seeking to reopen the assessment for AY 2012-13.
Thus, the impugned notice was issued after the expiry of four
years from the end of the relevant AY. Even Ms Razaq did not
dispute that for the impugned notice to be sustained, the
respondents would have to establish failure on the part of the
Petitioner to disclose fully and truly all material facts necessary for
its assessment for the relevant AY. Therefore, the main question in
this petition is whether there was any such failure.
5.     Upon receipt of the impugned notice, the Petitioner sought
reasons recorded and such reasons came to be furnished by
respondent no.1 to the Petitioner on 23.11.2019. In response, the
Petitioner filed detailed objections on 05.12.2019 to reopening
the assessment. However, respondent no.1, by order dated
07.12.2019, rejected the objections. Hence, the present petition.
6.     As noted earlier, the reasons for reopening the assessment
were furnished to the Petitioner on 23.11.2019, and the same
Subject: Reasons for re-opening of assessment proceedings for
With reference to your letter dated 05.11.2019 submitted through e-
portal, the reasons for re-opening of assessment proceedings for the
A.Y. 2012-13 in your own case is as under:
“1. The assessee is a company carrying on Mining business,
manufacture and sale of Iron Ore Pellets, Export of Ore, operation of
tippers, transhipper and machinery hire, trading in cranes and
2. As per the verification report received from O/o JDIT(I&Cl),
Bangalore during the year an e-auction of Iron Ore (mining) has been
conducted by the monitoring committee appointed by the Hon’ble
Supreme Court of India by the assessee and the total e-auctioned
amount for the F. Y.2011-12 was determined as under :
S.N Name of the assessee Category    Auction No.      E-Auctioned
.                                                     Amount for F.Y.
1    M/s Chowgule and Category B AUCTION              77,60,000/-
3.     To verify the above said transactions and whether the same has
been accounted or not a letter u/s 133(6) of the I.T. Act was issued to
the assessee on 13/12/2018 by the ITO(l&Cl), Panaji calling for
various details in respect of the FY 2011-12 ( AY 2012-13). The
assessee had furnished information vide letter dated 02.01.2019.
4.     As per the verification report, the assessee had filed its return of
income for the AY 2012-13 on 05.09.2012 declaring an income of
Rs.5.83 crore. The details of income declared by the assessee was
examined and it is found that the e-auctioned amount of iron ore for
the year 2011-12 was of Rs. 64.92 crore has not been offered to tax.
In reply to the show cause notice issued by the ITO (I&CI), Panaji
dated 10.01.2019, the assessee replied that “the iron ore of the
company was e-auctioned on 03.12.2011 as stated in Annexure 3.
During the FY 2011-12, 20,961 tons were e-auctioned by the MC.
However no portion of the sale proceeds were received by the
Company during the FY 2011-12. The same were received during FY
2013-14 and accounted in that year. The extract of account of
Monitoring Committee for these transaction accounted in FY 2013-
14 is enclosed herewith as Annexure-B”
5.     Further, as per report in respect of e-auction of iron ore by the
monitoring committee appointed the Supreme Court of India that the
said e-auction took place in the financial year 2011-12 and the same
has to be accounted in the same financial year. As the company
maintain its account as per Mercantile system and hence revenue/sales
determined (e-auctioned amount) in the FY 2011-12 ( A.Y. 2012-13)
has to be accounted in the same year. Hence, the assessee’s comments
as, “amount were received by us in the year 2013-14 and hence we
accounted in AY 2014-15” is not acceptable.
6.     Hence, the e-auctioned amount of Rs.64,92,00,000/-
determined by the monitoring committee appointed by the Hon'ble
Supreme Court of India is taxable in the year of e-auctioned took
place and amount determined i.e. FY 2011-12 (AY 2013-13).”
7.     Significantly, the reasons furnished do not even allege that
there was a failure to disclose fully and truly all material facts
necessary for the Petitioner’s assessment for AY 2012-13. Such
failure is an essential jurisdictional parameter that must be
fulfilled before any notice can be issued for reopening the
assessment proceedings after the expiry of four years from the end
of the relevant AY. In the absence of any such allegation or a plain
statement about compliance with this jurisdictional parameter,
the impugned notice cannot be ordinarily sustained.
8.      Ms Razaq, however, contended that even though the
reasons may not have alleged failure to disclose fully and truly all
material facts in so many words, if, factually, such failure is
established, then the impugned notice should not be interfered
9.      A contention similar to the one now raised by Ms Razaq
was rejected in Hindustan Lever Ltd. V/s. R.B. Wadkar 1. The
relevant discussion in paragraph 20 reads as follows :
“20. The reasons recorded by the Assessing
Officer nowhere state that there was failure on
the part of the assessee to disclose fully and truly
all material facts necessary for the assessment of
that assessment year. It is needless to mention
that the reasons are required to be read as they
were recorded by the Assessing Officer. No
substitution or deletion is permissible. No
additions can be made to those reasons. No
inference can be allowed to be drawn based on
reasons not recorded. it is for the Assessing
Officer to disclose and open his mind through
reasons recorded by him. He has to speak
through his reasons. It is for the Assessing
Officer to reach to the conclusion as to whether
there was failure on the part of the assessee to
disclose fully and truly all material facts
necessary for his assessment for the concerned
assessment year. It is for the Assessing Officer to
form his opinion. It is for him to put his
opinion on record in black and white. The
reasons recorded should be clear and
unambiguous and should not suffer from any
vagueness. The reasons recorded must disclose
his mind. Reasons are the manifestation of mind
of the Assessing Officer. The reasons recorded
should be self-explanatory and should not keep
the assessee guessing for the reasons. Reasons
provide link between conclusion and evidence.
The reasons recorded must be based on
evidence. The Assessing Officer, in the event of
challenge to the reasons, must be able to justify
the same based on material available on record.
He must disclose in the reasons as to which fact
or material was not disclosed by the assessee
fully and truly necessary for assessment of that
assessment year, so as to establish vital link
between the reasons and evidence. That vital
link is the safeguard against arbitrary reopening
of the concluded assessment. The reasons
recorded by the Assessing Officer cannot be
supplemented by filing affidavit or making oral
submission, otherwise, the reasons which were
lacking in the material particulars would get
supplemented, by the time the matter reaches to
the Court, on the strength of affidavit or oral
submissions advanced.”
10.    Similarly, in Bajaj Allianz Life Insurance Company Ltd.
V/s. Deputy Commissioner of Income Tax, Circle1(1) 2,
another Division Bench quashed the notice issued after the expiry
of four years from the end of the relevant AY, inter alia, on the
ground that in the reasons furnished, there was not even an
allegation of failure on the part of the Assessee to truly and finally
disclose all material facts necessary for assessment. Moreover, the
Division Bench held that mentioning this requirement in the
reasons is not an empty formality because it shows that the
Assessing Officer is aware of the jurisdictional requirement.
of Income Tax Circle 2(1), Goa, Commissioner of Income
Tax3, the Division Bench held that in the reasons furnished to the
Assessee if there is no reference to the alleged failure to disclose
material facts, the impugned notice issued beyond four years or
after the expiry or from the end of the four years of the relevant
AY will not sustain.

12.    Thus, in the present case, the impugned notice would
ordinarily have to be set aside because the reasons furnished to the
Assessee do not even allege any failure to disclose truly and fully
the material facts necessary for assessing AY 2012-2013.
13.    Besides, given Ms Razak’s contention, even if some latitude
is extended to the Revenue by overlooking the absence of
allegation about failure to disclose material facts, the record bears
out that the Petitioner made complete disclosures in the present
case. Consequently, even on facts, the Revenue failed to establish
any failure to disclose truly and fully all material facts necessary
for its assessment for AY 2012-13.
14.    After the Petitioner filed its return, by communication
dated 13.12.2018, the Petitioner was informed that the Revenue
was in possession of information regarding the E-auction of iron
ore conducted by the Monitoring Committee appointed by the
Hon’ble Supreme Court of India. The communication referred to
the information available with the Revenue about the Petitioner’s
iron ore that was E-auctioned during AY 2012-13. In this
context,      the    Petitioner      was      required  to    furnish
information/documents, which included a brief note about
business activities carried out by the Petitioner, details of mining
leases held by the Petitioner and the details of iron ore E-
auctioned by the Monitoring Committee for AY 2012-13 in the
format which was prescribed.
15.    The Petitioner filed a response on 31.12.2018, in which
complete disclosures were made. In particular, the Petitioner
disclosed that its iron ore was E-auctioned on 03.12.2011 as
detailed in Annexure 3 to the communication. The Petitioner
further informed the Revenue that during AY 2012-13, 209,961
tons of ore was E-auctioned by the Monitoring Committee. The
Petitioner pointed out that the Petitioner received no portion of
the sale proceeds during AY 2012-13. The sale proceeds were
ultimately received during AY 2013-14, which was duly
accounted for during the said year. Even the extract of the
account of the Monitoring Committee for such transactions
accounted during AY 2013-14 was enclosed as Annexure 8.
16.    The Petitioner also pointed out that the E-auctioned
amount of iron ore for AY 2012-13 was of ₹64.92 crores, but the
same was not offered to tax because the Petitioner never received
this amount during AY 2012-13. Further, there was uncertainty
about the status of this amount, given the orders made by the
Hon’ble Supreme Court on this subject from time to time.
Finally, the Petitioner pointed out that no sooner than this
amount of ₹64.92 crores was received in the following AY, the
same was offered for tax. The Revenue assessed this offer and
taxed the Petitioner at a higher rate of 34% when the tax rate for
AY 2012-13 would have been only 32%.
17.    Based upon the above disclosures, the Petitioner’s return
was duly assessed, and no additions were ordered. Therefore, the
fact that the assessment order makes no explicit reference to the
disclosures is hardly relevant.
18.    From the above-undisputed material on record, it is
apparent that the Petitioner did not fail to disclose fully and truly
all material facts necessary for its assessment for the relevant AY
2012-13. The impugned notice, therefore, cannot sustain.
19.    Ms Razaq, however, contended that since the Petitioner was
following the mercantile system of accounting, even the amounts
that were accrued to the Petitioner ought to have been offered to
tax irrespective of whether the Petitioner actually received the
same or not. Since such an amount of ₹64.92 crores was not
offered for assessment during AY 2012-13, even though according
to her this amount was accrued to the Petitioner, there was failure
to disclose fully and truly all material facts.
20.    As noted earlier, the Petitioner had fully and fully disclosed
all material facts regarding this amount of ₹64.92 crores. Based
on the same, the Assessing Officer could have taken the view that
even the amount of ₹64.92 crores warrants tax payment because
the same was accrued to the Petitioner during the AY 2012-13.
Further, perhaps the Revenue could have explored the possibility
of reopening the assessment within four years from the end of the
relevant AY. However, for any attempt to reopen the assessment
after four years from the end of the relevant AY, the Revenue had
to establish failure on the part of the Assessee to disclose fully and
truly all material facts necessary for its assessment for that relevant
AY. In the absence of this jurisdictional parameter, the impugned
notice seeking to reopen the assessment four years after the end of
the relevant AY would not sustain.
21.    The question in such matters is not whether the amount
had indeed accrued to the Petitioner during the AY 2012-13. At
best, in the facts of the present case, that would be a debatable
issue. However, the main issue is whether the Petitioner had fully
disclosed all material facts concerning the transaction of E-
auction by the Monitoring Committee, the sale of ore, and the
sale of 209,961 tons of ore by the Monitoring Committee. Once
it is established that all material facts were fully and truly
disclosed, the Revenue would not be entitled to reopen the
assessment after four years from the end of the relevant AY.
Commissioner of Income Tax 4, the Division Bench of this
Court pointed out that there is a well-known difference between a
wrong claim by an Assessee after disclosing the true and material
facts and the wrong claim made by the Assessee by withholding
material facts fully and truly. Only in the latter case would the
Assessing Officer be entitled to reopen the assessment after four
23.    Therefore, the question is not whether the Petitioner was
right in not offering the amount of ₹64.92 crores to tax during
AY 2012-13, but the question is whether the Petitioner had
disclosed, fully and truly all material facts concerning this amount
of ₹64.92 crores, which, incidentally, was never received by the
Petitioner during AY 2012-13. Moreover, the Petitioner disclosed
this material fact and explained why this amount was not brought
to tax during AY 2012-13. Apparently, this explanation found
favour with the Assessing Officer; therefore, this amount was not
added to the returned income for the relevant AY.

24.   As noted earlier, the record also bears out that the Petitioner
duly accounted for the above amount for the following AY 2013-
14, and appropriate tax was paid thereon. Moreover, the AO for
AY 2013-2014 did not object to this amount of Rs.64.92 crores
being offered to tax in AY 2013-2014 or not being offered to tax
25.   Thus, for all the above reasons, we are satisfied that the
impugned notice exceeds the prescribed jurisdictional parameters.
The impugned notice is accordingly quashed and set aside.
26.   The rule is made absolute in terms of prayer clauses (a),(b)
and (c), which read as follows:
