well as Sri Anirudha Singh, and Sri Shiv Ram Singh, learned A.G.A.-I
for the State and perused the record.
3.     The applicant, Fayanath Yadav, has moved this fourth bail
application seeking bail in Case Crime 381/2011, under Sections 498-
A, 304B I.P.C. and Section 3/4 Dowry Prohibition Act, Police Station
4.     This fourth bail application has been placed before this regular
Bench in the light of Hon'ble The Chief Justice's order dated
5.     Learned counsel for the applicant has submitted that the
applicant is innocent and has been falsely implicated in the present
case. He further submits that the applicant has almost completed more
than eleven years in incarceration, but till date the trial of this case has
not been concluded.
6.     Learned counsel for the applicant further submits that the F.I.R.
was lodged on 23.05.2011 and the applicant is named in the F.I.R.
along with other co-accused persons and during investigation the
complicity of four co-accused persons was not found, as such they
were exonerated by the Investigating Officer. He further submits that
there is no overt act assigned to the accused applicant and the
allegation that the deceased was beaten in-front of villagers and was
taken around the village is not supported by any independent witness
of the village. The entire prosecution story developped in the F.I.R. is
false and fabricated with the intention to falsely implicate the
applicant and his relatives.
7.       Learned counsel for the applicant further submits that the
mother of the applicant, namely, Smt. Kesh Pati was already granted
bail by this Court vide order dated 13.09.2011 passed in Bail No. 6355
of 2011, but the applicant is languishing in jail since 01.06.2011 and
his first bail application was rejected by Hon’ble Mr. Justice Ashok
Pal Singh (now retired) vide order dated 27.05.2013 passed in Bail
Application No. 5793/2012. The order dated 13.09.2011 is being
reproduced as under:
This bail application is rejected for want of
prosecution.”
8.     Learned counsel for the applicant further submits that thereafter
the applicant has moved second bail application, which was also
rejected by Hon’ble Mr. Justice Surendra Vikram Singh Rathore (now
retired) vide order dated 27.08.2015 passed in Bail Application No.
8318/2014 and while rejecting the second bail application, Hon’ble
Court however directed the trial court to expedite the trial strictly
adhering to the provisions of Section 309 Cr.P.C. The order dated
27.08.2015 is being reproduced as under:
“Heard learned counsel for the applicant, learned
A.G.A. and perused the record.
The applicant is involved in Case Crime No. 381 of 2011,
under Sections 498-A & 304-B I.P.C. and Section 3/4 of
the Dowry Prohibition Act, Police Station Kurebhar,
It is a case of dowry death. The applicant is the husband
of the deceased. The victim died an unnatural death
within a very short span of time after her marriage i.e.
about one year. There is specific allegation of demand of
dowry and consequential ill treatment.
Submission of learned counsel for the applicant is that
the victim had committed suicide by pouring kerosene oil
on her and the applicant made an effort for her rescue
due to which he also received burn injuries. It is further
submitted that in this case some other family members
were also arrayed as accused persons, however, during
investigation, their involvement was found to be false.
Learned A.G.A. has opposed prayer for bail.
Perusal of the record shows that the incident had taken
place in the intervening night of 22/23-5-2014 and the
applicant was medically examined after about eight days
of the incident on 1.6.2014. During this period he
remained absconding.
It is further submitted on behalf of the applicant that
there is no dying declaration of the deceased.
Had there been any dying declaration, then the accused
applicant would have been charge sheeted under Section
Learned counsel for the applicant has informed the
Court that PW-1 complainant has been examined during
trial but his cross examination is not yet concluded.
Cross examination has to be done on behalf of the
accused himself and not on behalf of the prosecution. It
appears that the applicant himself is delaying the
disposal of the trial.
Keeping in view the short period within which the victim
died an unnatural death and suffered cruelty in
connection with demand of dowry, no case for bail is
made out. Bail application is accordingly rejected as the
husband is the main accused in such nature of cases.
However, the trial court is hereby directed to expedite the
trial strictly adhering to the provisions of Section 309
9.     Learned counsel for the applicant further submits that there was
a specific direction of this Court to expedite the trial but the trial of
the case was not concluded for three year. Thereafter, the applicant
again moved the third bail application, which was also rejected by
Hon’ble Mr. Justice Anant Kumar (now retired) vide order dated
25.07.2019 passed in Bail Application No. 3860/2018 with the
direction that the trial court is directed to expedite the trial and take
proper coercive steps against the witnesses to ensure that the trial will
be concluded preferably within a period of six months. The order
dated 25.07.2019 is being reproduced as under:
“This is the third bail application. The first bail
application being Bail No.5793 of 2012 was rejected for
want of prosecution. The second bail application being
Bail No.8318 of 2014 was rejected on merits.
Supplementary affidavit filed today is taken on record.
Heard learned counsel for the applicant, learned A.G.A.
for the State and perused the record.
The present bail application has been filed by the
applicant in Case Crime No.381/2011, under Sections
As an additional ground, it is stated by learned counsel
for he applicant that the applicant is in jail since 2011
and the trial has not yet been concluded. It is also stated
that during course of trial, statement of two witnesses
has been recorded but they have not stated specifically
about the demand of dowry.
Opposing the bail, learned A.G.A. has stated that the
mother of the deceased Sumita has been examined as
PW.1 before the trial court. She has clearly stated that
even before the occurrence the deceased was badly
beaten by the inlaws and the present applicant. She was
roamed around the village. Her clothes were also torn.
The death has been caused by burning. Kerosene oil was
poured upon her and put her to fire.
All these facts have already been considered by the court
while considering the second bail application. The trial
is in progress. There is no good ground for granting bail.
Accordingly, the bail application is rejected.
The trial court is directed to expedite the trial and take
proper coercive steps against the witnesses to ensure that
the trial will be concluded preferably within a period of
10. Learned counsel for the applicant further submits that more than
three years have been passed after the rejection of the third bail, but
the trial of the present case till date has not been concluded and as per
information received out of 18 prosecution witnesses only 06
prosecution witnesses have been examined till date. He further
submits that there is a clear cut direction of this Court to expedite the
trial of the case and the time prescribed by this Court i.e. six months
have already been expired and more than 11 years have been passed
from the date of detention of the applicant, but the trial of the present
case has been yet been concluded and further submits that it will take
much time for conclusion of trial. Therefore, in the light of the dictum
of the Hon'ble Apex Court in re; Union of India vs. K.A. Najeeb
reported in AIR 2021 Supreme Court 712 and Paras Ram Vishnoi
vs. The Director, Central Bureau of Investigation passed in
Criminal Appeal No.693 of 2021 (Arising out of SLP (Crl) No.3610
of 2020), wherein it has been held that if the accused person is in jail
for substantially long period and there is no possibility to conclude the
trial in near future, the bail application may be considered. Besides,
learned counsel for the applicant has referred the dictum of the
Hon'ble Apex Court in re; Gokarakonda Naga Saibaba v. State of
Maharashtra, (2018) 12 SCC 505, wherein it has been held that if all
fact / material witnesses have been examined, the bail application of
the accused may be considered and they were entitled for bail. Para-16
of the case K.A.Najeeb (supra) is being reproduced here-in-below:-
"This Court has clarified in numerous judgments that the liberty
guaranteed by Part III of the Constitution would cover within its
protective ambit not only due procedure and fairness but also
access to justice and a speedy trial. In Supreme Court Legal Aid
Committee Representing Undertrial Prisoners v. Union of India,
it was held that undertrials cannot indefinitely be detained
pending trial. Ideally, no person ought to suffer adverse
consequences of his acts unless the same is established before a
neutral arbiter. However, owing to the practicalities of real life
where to secure an effective trial and to ameliorate the risk to
society in case a potential criminal is left at large pending trial,
Courts are tasked with deciding whether an individual ought to be
released pending trial or not. Once it is obvious that a timely trial
would not be possible and the accused has suffered incarceration
for a significant period of time, Courts would ordinarily be
obligated to enlarge them on bail."
11. The Apex Court in the case of Paras Ram Vishnoi (supra) has
"On consideration of the matter, we are of the view that pending
the trial we cannot keep a person in custody for an indefinite
period of time and taking into consideration the period of
custody and that the other accused are yet to lead defence
evidence while the appellant has already stated he does not
propose to lead any evidence, we are inclined to grant bail to the
appellant on terms and conditions to the satisfaction of the trial
court."
12. Learned counsel for the applicant has also placed reliance on
the latest order of the Supreme Court dated 25th February, 2022 in
Criminal Appeal No.308/2022 (Saudan Singh vs. State of UP)
arising out of SLP (Crl) No.4633 of 2021. The relevant part of the
order is reproduced herein below:-
"We have put to learned AAG and the learned counsel for
the High Court that a list should be prepared of all cases
where the person has served out a sentence of 14 years, is
not a repeat offender, and in any case if in these cases at
one go bail can be granted and cases remitted for
examination under the Uttar Pradesh Prisoners Release
on Probation Rules, 1938. In all these cases, there is a
high possibility that if these people are released, they
may not be even interested in prosecuting their appeals.
The second category of cases can be one where the
person has served out more than 10 years of sentence. In
these cases also at one go bail can be granted unless there
are any extenuating circumstances against him.
We are quite hopeful that the High Court will adopt the
aforesaid practice and thus prevent the Supreme Court to
be troubled with such matters"
Similar view has also been reiterated by Hon’ble the Apex Court in
Brijesh Kumar @ Ramu v. State of U.P., Criminal Appeal No. 540
of 2022 in its judgment dated 01.04.2022 and in Vipul Vs. State of
U.P., Special Leave to Appeal (Crl) No (s). 3114 of 2022 in its
judgment dated 08.04.2022 and in Suleman Vs. State of U.P.,
Criminal Appeal No. 491/2022 in its judgment dated 09.05.2022.
13. Learned counsel for the applicant has also placed reliance of
Hon'ble Apex Court judgment in the case of Kamal Vs. State of
Haryana, 2004 (13) SCC 526 and submitted that the Hon'ble Apex
Court was pleased to observe in paragraph no. 2 of the judgment as
"2. This is a case in which the appellant has been convicted
u/s 304-B of the India Penal Code and sentenced to
imprisonment for 7 years. It appears that so far the
appellant has undergone imprisonment for about 2 years
and four months. The High Court declined to grant bail
pending disposal of the appeal before it. We are of the view
that the bail should have been granted by the High Court,
especially having regard to the fact that the appellant has
already served a substantial period of the sentence. In the
circumstances, we direct that the bail be granted to the
appellant on conditions as may be imposed by the District
and Sessions Judge, Faridabad."
14. Learned counsel for the applicant has also placed reliance of
Hon'ble Apex Court judgment in the case of Takht Singh Vs. State of
Madhya Pradesh, 2001 (10) SCC 463, and submitted that the
Hon'ble Apex Court was pleased to observe in paragraph no. 2 of the
"2. The appellants have been convicted under Section
302/149, Indian Penal Code by the learned Sessions
Judge and have been sentenced to imprisonment for life.
Against the said conviction and sentence their appeal to
the High Court is pending. Before the High Court
application for suspension of sentence and bail was filed
but the High Court rejected that prayer indicating therein
that the applicants can renew their prayer for bail after
one year. After the expiry of one year the second
application was filed but the same has been rejected by
the impugned order. It is submitted that the appellants are
already in jail for over 3 years and 3 months. There is no
possibility of early hearing of the appeal in the High
Court. In the aforesaid circumstances the applicants be
released on bail to the satisfaction of the learned Chief
Judicial Magistrate, Sehore. The appeal is disposed of
accordingly."
Learned counsel for the applicant further submits that ratio of
law applicable in aforesaid cases is also applicable in the case of the
applicant, therefore, the applicant be enlarged on bail by this Court
15. Several other submissions regarding legality and illegality of
the allegations made in the F.I.R. have also been placed forth before
the Court. The circumstances which, according to the counsel, led to
the false implication of the accused, have also been touched upon at
length. It has been assured on behalf of the applicant that he is ready
to cooperate with the process of law and shall faithfully make himself
available before the court whenever required and is also ready to
accept all the conditions which the Court may deem fit to impose
upon him. The applicant undertakes that in case he is released on bail
he will not misuse the liberty of bail and will cooperate in trial. It has
also been pointed out that the applicant is not having any criminal
16. Sri Aniruddh Singh, learned A.G.A. opposed the prayer for bail,
but does not dispute this fact that till date as per information furnished
by the Investigating Officer, out of 18 prosecution witnesses only 06
prosecution witnesses have been examined, which is also mentioned
in para 21 of the counter affidavit filed by the State and also does not
dispute this fact that the applicant is languishing in jail since
01.06.2011 and has completed more than 11 years in incarceration.
17. After perusing the record in the light of the submissions made at
the Bar and after taking an overall view of all the facts and
circumstances of this case, at the very outset, this Court anguish
towards the poor progress of trial, the trial must have been concluded
by now and the learned trial court is having powers to take coercive
method to conclude the trial and also armed with the provisions of
Section 309 Cr.P.C., therefore, this Court is unable to comprehend as
to how there is no good progress in the trial, the nature of evidence,
the period of detention already undergone, the unlikelihood of early
conclusion of trial and also the absence of any convincing material to
indicate the possibility of tampering with the evidence, and
considering that applicant is in jail since 01.06.2011 and has
completed more than 11 years in incarceration and the trial has not yet
been concluded and out of 18 witnesses only 06 witnesses have been
examined as per the counter affidavit filed by the State as well as
considering the larger mandate of the Article 21 of the Constitution of
India and the law laid down by the Hon'ble Apex Court in the cases of
Saudan Singh’s case (supra) and Suleman (supra), K.A. Najeeb
(supra), Kamal (supra), Takht Singh (supra) and Dataram Singh
vs. State of U.P. and another, reported in (2018) 3 SCC 22, this
Court is of the view that the applicant may be enlarged on bail.
18.    The prayer for bail is granted. The application is allowed.
19. Let the applicant, Fayanath Yadav, involved in Case Crime
381/2011, under Sections 498-A, 304B I.P.C. and Section 3/4 Dowry
Prohibition Act, Police Station Kurebhar, District Sultanpur, be
