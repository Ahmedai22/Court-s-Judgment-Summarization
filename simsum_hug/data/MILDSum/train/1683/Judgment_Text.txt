Counsel for          Sri Chandan Sharma, Sri Anuj Srivastava,
Counsel for          Sri Kartikeya Saran, Sri Anoop Trivedi,
1. This is a second contempt application, the earlier Contempt Application
(Civil) No. 3847 of 2017 having been disposed of on 05.09.2017 for
complying the order of writ Court by the opposite party, the same having
not been complied with, the present contempt proceedings have been
initiated at the behest of the applicant.
2. This case has a chequered history, according to the applicant he
purchased lands of khasra Nos. 314, 329, 332, 333, 334, 335, 330 and 331
situated at Village Mahiuddin Kanawani, Pargana Loni, Tehsil Dadri,
District Ghaziabad through registered sale-deed on 24.09.2002. Mutation
was carried out over the said land. The State Government on 16.10.2004
issued a notification under Section 4 (1) and Section 17 (4) of the Land
Acquisition Act 1894. By the said notification a total of 367-0-5 Bighas or
229.5390 Acres or 92.893 Hectare of land of Village Mahiuddin
Kanawani, Pargana Loni, Tehsil Dadri, District Ghaziabad was to be
acquired for residential scheme of Ghaziabad Development Authority
(hereinafter referred as the ‘Authority’).
3. The said notification included the land of the applicant of khasra No.
314-M, 329-M, 330, 331-M, 332-M, 353-M, 334-M and 335-M total area
8 Bigha i.e. 2.0240 Hectare. Notification under Section 6 of the Act of
1894 was published on 28.11.2005. The said notification was challenged
by the applicant through Civil Misc. Writ Petition No. 7775 of 2005 and
the Division Bench of this Court on 22.12.2005 granted interim order as
to the dispossession of the applicant from the land in dispute. The said
writ petition was disposed of on 07.12.2007 with a direction to the
Authority to implement its Board Resolution dated 20.02.2003 so far as it
relates to the release of the applicant's land.
4. Against the said order, the Authority filed special leave to appeal being
Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No. 18828 of 2008 wherein the Apex
Court on 17.04.2009 granted interim order. On 21.04.2012 the State
authorities made award under Section 11 read with Section 17 but the land
of the applicant was not included. On 08.05.2015 an award was declared
in respect of the applicant’s land. The Apex Court allowed the appeal of
the Authority on 09.09.2015 and set-aside the order passed by Division
Bench of this Court dated 07.12.2007 and directed the Authority to
consider the request of the applicant. On 06.10.2015 the Authority
rejected the request of the applicant for release of the land.
5. The said order was challenged through Civil Misc. Writ Petition No.
60276 of 2015. The said writ petition was finally decided on 09.05.2017
and the Special Land Acquisition Officer was directed to redetermine the
award by determining the market value of land as on 01.01.2014. The
Court further directed that the redetermination of the amount of
compensation shall be done under the provisions of The Right to Fair
Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and
Resettlement Act, 2013 (hereinafter referred as the ‘Act of 2013’) by
treating 1st January 2014 as the date on which the market value of land
should be determined. The said exercise was to be completed within three
months. Post remand, the Special Land Acquisition Officer calculated the
amount of compensation at circle rate prevalent on 01.01.2014 i.e. at the
rate of Rs. 70,000/- per square meter and requested the Authority to
deposit the amount so that the award may be declared.
6. In the meantime, the Authority filed a Special Leave Petition (Civil)
No. 17660 of 2017 before the Apex Court. The said SLP was dismissed on
19.07.2017. After dismissal of SLP, applicant filed Contempt Application
(Civil) No. 3874 of 2017 against the opposite parties for not complying
the order dated 09.05.2017 passed by this Court. The Contempt Court on
05.09.2017 disposed off the contempt application granting two months
time for complying the order of writ Court. Thereafter, the Authority filed
the Review Petition No. 2765 of 2017 in SLP No. 17660 of 2017 before
the Apex Court for reviewing its order dated 19.07.2017. The said review
petition was dismissed on 05.12.2017. In the meantime, the contempt
proceedings were initiated against the opposite party for not complying
the order of writ Court despite the dismissal of SLP and review petition.
7. On 29.05.2019 the proposed award was prepared at the rate of Rs.
23317.84/- per square meter and the total amount calculated was Rs.
1,27,81,16,673/-. As the amount involved was more than Rs. 10 crores
approval of the Divisional Commissioner was required before the
declaration/publication of award and the matter was sent to the
Commissioner for approval. On 05.07.2019 the Commissioner, Meerut
Division granted the approval to the modified compensation subject to the
condition that after deposit of compensation amount and acquisition
expenses by the acquiring body the proposed award may be
declared/published under the relevant provisions of the Act and Rules.
The order of Commissioner was communicated to the District Magistrate
Ghaziabad on 10.07.2019. On 16.07.2019 a letter was sent by Special
Land Acquisition Officer to the Authority to deposit the compensation
amount. In the meantime, the Authority filed a Curative Petition No. 12 of
2019 before the Apex Court which was rejected on 28.08.2019.
8. The district authorities on 13.11.2020, 19.11.2020, 27.11.2020,
16.12.2020, 27.10.2021, 29.10.2021 and 07.03.2022 wrote letters to the
Authority to deposit the compensation amount so that the modified award
as prepared on 29.05.2019 could be declared and published.
9. Earlier, on 09.11.2020 the Court had directed to disburse an amount of
Rs. 10 crore which was already deposited by the Authority on 27.03.2019
against the estimated compensation, as there was no award. A
modification application was filed to modify the order dated 09.11.2020,
but the same was rejected on 05.02.2021, however, on another
modification application the Court directed for payment of Rs. 10 crore to
the applicant and the same was paid on 12.03.2021.
10. In the meantime, the State approached the Supreme Court through
Special Leave Petition No. 20025 of 2019 challenging the order dated
09.05.2017 passed by this Court in Writ-C No. 60276 of 2015. The said
SLP was dismissed on 02.09.2021. Thereafter, review petitions were filed
being Review Petition Nos. 359 of 2021 and 349 of 2021 in Writ-C No.
60276 of 2015 against the judgment dated 09.05.2017, which were
dismissed on 02.02.2022.
11. Against the dismissal of review petition, the Authority filed SLP
before the Apex Court which was dismissed on 01.04.2022. On
20.04.2022 the Authority has filed an objection before the district
authorities to determine the rate of compensation on the basis of
prevailing rate on agricultural land on 01.01.2014 adjoining to the land of
Village Mahiuddin Kanawani after affording opportunity of hearing to the
Authority. On 23.04.2022 considering the objection raised by the
Authority, the District Magistrate requested the Commissioner to give
permission for making amendment in determining the rate of
compensation and to constitute a High Level Committee, to redetermine
the rate of compensation. On 26.04.2022 the Commissioner, Meerut
Division, Meerut had constituted a six member committee for
redetermining the rate of compensation. A detailed report was submitted
by the said committee on 04.05.2022.
12. The authorities considering the recommendation of the committee
redetermined the compensation at the rate of Rs. 2626.25 per square meter
and total compensation has been determined as Rs. 23,01,16,360/- on
04.05.2022, and the approval has been granted by the Divisional
Commissioner. On the same day, the Special Land Acquisition Officer
made a demand for deposit of amount of compensation from the Authority
alongwith administrative expenses. After the amount was deposited by the
Authority an award to the tune of Rs. 23,01,16,360/- has been declared
and published by the Special Land Acquisition Officer on 06.05.2022
following the provision of Section 26 (1) (b) of the Act of 2013.
13. Sri Chandan Sharma, learned counsel for the applicant, submitted that
the opposite parties are clearly in contempt of the order of writ Court
dated 09.05.2017 as the Special Land Acquisition Officer was required to
redetermine the award and calculate the compensation payable to the
applicant under the provisions of the Act of 2013 by treating 01.01.2014,
as the date on which market value of the land was to be calculated.
According to him, once the exercise was taken by the Special Land
Acquisition Officer on 29.05.2019 and the proposed award was made
calculating the compensation at the rate of Rs. 23317.84/- per square
meter no occasion arose to modify the award subsequently, on the
application of Authority, and to redetermine at the rate of Rs. 2626.25/-
per square meter in the year 2022.
14. According to Sri Sharma the award once proposed cannot be changed
subsequently by the State authorities and the order of writ Court having
been not complied, the officers are liable to be punished under Section 12
of the Contempt of Courts Act. He also emphasized upon the fact that the
order dated 09.05.2017 having been challenged by both the State and the
Authority before the Apex Court, and having failed there, no occasion
arose to withhold the proposed award and, then redetermine it again in the
15. Sri Ravi Kant, learned Senior Counsel appearing for the Authority,
submitted that the award dated 06.05.2022 is according to the provisions
of the Act of 2013 and the market value of the nearby villages as on
01.01.2014 has been taken into consideration by the authorities. He
further submits that the fair value of the land i.e. Rs. 2626.25/- per square
meter has been awarded to the applicant and the order of writ Court has
been complied with in entirety. According to him, the order of writ Court
was to the Special Land Acquisition Officer to redetermine the award by
determining the market value of the land as on 01.01.2014, which the
authorities have done while declaring the award.
16. Learned Senior Counsel also submitted that the remedy available to
the applicant under the law is by making reference under Section 64 of the
Act of 2013 and not the contempt proceedings. Once the order of writ
Court has been complied with, in case the applicant is not satisfied by the
award he may avail the legal remedy provided under the law and present
contempt proceedings are not maintainable.
17. Sri M.C. Chaturvedi, learned Additional Advocate General appearing
for the officers of the State, submitted that the order of writ Court was
specific to the extent that the Special Land Acquisition Officer was to
redetermine the award by determining the market value of the land as on
01.01.2014 which has been done after six member committee was
constituted by the Commissioner, who submitted its report and the award
was declared on 06.05.2022. He further emphasized that after declaration
of the award the sole remedy left to the applicant is under Section 64 of
the Act of 2013 and the present contempt proceedings have become
18. I have heard learned counsel for the parties and perused the material
on record.
19. Before adverting to decide the issue in hand, as to whether any
deliberate or wilful disobedience of the order of writ Court has been made
by the opposite party or not, a glance of Section 2 (b) of the Contempt of
Courts Act 1971 (hereinafter referred as the ‘Act of 1971’) is necessary
for better appreciation of the case, which is extracted hereasunder;
“2. (b) “civil contempt” means wilful disobedience to any judgment,
decree, direction, order, writ or other process of a court or wilful breach
of an undertaking given to a court;”
20. From the reading of the above provisions, it is crystal clear that a civil
contempt would be attracted only when there is               wilful disobedience of
any judgment, decree, direction, order, writ or other process of the Court.
21. In order to punish a contemnor for the alleged wilful disobedience, it
has to be established that disobedience of the order is “wilful”. The
Supreme Court had occasion to consider the term “wilful” in its judgment
rendered in the case of Ram Kishan Vs. Tarun Bajaj and others 2014
(16) SCC 204, the Court held that the word “wilful” introduces a mental
element and hence, requires looking into the mind of a person/contemnor
by gauging his actions, which is an indication of one’s state of mind.
According to the Court, the word “wilful” means knowingly, intentional,
conscious, calculated and deliberate with full knowledge of consequences
flowing therefrom.         It   excludes      casual,    accidental,     bonafide     or
unintentional acts or genuine inability. Wilful act is to be distinguished
from an act done carelessly, thoughtlessly, heedlessly or inadvertently.
The relevant paragraph nos. 11 and 12 of the judgment are extracted
“11. Contempt jurisdiction conferred onto the law courts power to
punish an offender for his wilful disobedience/contumacious conduct or
obstruction to the majesty of law, for the reason that respect and
authority commanded by the courts of law are the greatest guarantee to
an ordinary citizens that his rights shall be protected and the entire
democratic fabric of the society will crumble down if the respect of the
judiciary is undermined. Undoubtedly, the contempt jurisdiction is a
powerful weapon in the hands of the courts of law but that by itself
operates as a string of caution and unless, thus, otherwise satisfied
beyond reasonable doubt, it would neither fair nor reasonable for the
law courts to exercise jurisdiction under the Act. The proceedings are
quasi- criminal in nature, and therefore, standard of proof required in
these proceedings is beyond all reasonable doubt. It would rather be
hazardous to impose sentence for contempt on the authorities in exercise
of contempt jurisdiction on mere probabilities.
12. Thus, in order to punish a contemnor, it has to be established that
disobedience of the order is ‘wilful’. The word ‘wilful’ introduces a
mental element and hence, requires looking into the mind of
person/contemnor by gauging his actions, which is an indication of one’s
state of mind. ‘Wilful’ means knowingly intentional, conscious,
calculated and deliberate with full knowledge of consequences flowing
therefrom. It excludes casual, accidental, bonafide or unintentional acts
or genuine inability. Wilful acts does not encompass involuntarily or
negligent actions. The act has to be done with a “bad purpose or without
justifiable excuse or stubbornly, obstinately or perversely”. Wilful act is
to be distinguished from an act done carelessly, thoughtlessly, heedlessly
or inadvertently. It does not include any act done negligently or
involuntarily. The deliberate conduct of a person means that he knows
what he is doing and intends to do the same. Therefore, there has to be a
calculated action with evil motive on his part. Even if there is a
disobedience of an order, but such disobedience is the result of some
compelling circumstances under which it was not possible for the
contemnor to comply with the order, the contemnor cannot be punished.
“Committal or sequestration will not be ordered unless contempt
involves a degree of default or misconduct”
the Apex Court held that the proceedings under the Act of 1971 has a
serious consequence. The proceedings for contempt should be initiated
with utmost reservation. It should be exercised with due care and caution.
The Apex Court relied upon its earlier judgment in P.C. Sen (1969) 2
SCR 649 and Jhareswar Prasad Paul and Another v. Tarak Nath
Ganguly & Ors. (2002) 5 SCC 352. The relevant Paragraph no. 23 of the
judgment is extracted hereasunder:-
“A proceeding under the Contempt of Courts Act has a serious
consequence. Whether the alleged contemnor has willfully committed
breach of the order passed by a competent court of law or not having
regard to the civil/evil consequences ensuing therefor require strict
scrutiny. For the said purpose, it may be permissible to read the order of
the court in its entirety. The effect and purport of the order should be
taken into consideration. Whereas the court shall always zealously
enforce its order but a mere technicality should not be a ground to punish
the contemnor. A proceeding for contempt should be initiated with utmost
reservation. It should be exercised with due care and caution. The power
of the court in imposing punishment for contempt of the court is not an
uncontrolled or unlimited power. It is a controlled power and restrictive
in nature (See Re: P.C. Sen [(1969) 2 SCR 649] and Jhareswar Prasad
Paul and Another v. Tarak Nath Ganguly & Ors. [(2002) 5 SCC 352].
A contemnor, thus, may be punished only when a clear case for
contumacious conduct has been made out.”
23. It is well settled that Court dealing with application for Contempt of
Courts cannot traverse beyond the order. It cannot test correctness, or
otherwise of the order or give additional direction or delete any direction,
as it would amount to be exercising review jurisdiction with an
application for initiation of contempt proceedings. It is impermissible.
The Apex Court had occasion to hold such view in case of Prithawi Nath
Ram Vs. State of Jharkhand and others, AIR 2004 SC 4277.
24. In Three Cheers Entertainment Private Limited and others Vs.
CESC Limited, 2008 (16) SCC 592, the Apex Court had the occasion to
consider whether a contempt proceedings can be drawn by a roving
enquiry. The Court held, a roving enquiry is not permissible. Relevant
paragraph nos. 25, 29, 30 are extracted hereasunder:-
“25. Indisputably, the majesty of the Court is required to be upheld. The
Court must see that its orders are complied with. But for the said
purpose, a roving enquiry is not permissible. Several proceedings which
seek to achieve the same purpose are unknown to the process of law. If
the trial was to be held on the issues framed by the learned Single Judge,
it should have been allowed to be brought to its logical conclusion. When
the trial was incomplete, we fail to see any reason why the contempt
proceeding was heard on affidavits. Even if that was done, reliance was
sought to be placed on the depositions of the witnesses in the said
enquiry, which was admittedly incomplete. Witnesses affirming affidavits
before the learned Single Judge were not being cross- examined so as to
enable the counsel for the parties to draw their attention to the earlier
statement made by them in terms of Section 145 of the Evidence Act.
29. Contempt of court is a matter which deserves to be dealt with all
seriousness. In Mrityunjoy Das & Anr. v. Sayed Hasibur Rahman &
Ors. [(2001) 3 SCC 739], this Court held :
“13. Before however, proceeding with the matter any further,
be it noted that exercise of powers under the Contempt of
Courts Act shall have to be rather cautious and use of it rather
sparingly after addressing itself to the true effect of the
contemptuous conduct. The court must otherwise come to a
conclusion that the conduct complained of tantamounts to
obstruction of justice which if allowed, would even permeate in
our society (vide Murray & Co. v. Ashok Kr. Newatia). This is
a special jurisdiction conferred on to the law courts to punish
an offender for his contemptuous conduct or obstruction the
majesty of law.”
30. In Chhotu Ram v. Urvashi Gulati & Anr. [(2001) 7 SCC 530], this
Court held that a contempt of court proceeding being quasi criminal in
nature, the burden to prove would be upon the person who made such an
allegation. A person cannot be sentenced on mere probability. Willful
disobedience and contumacious conduct is the basis on which a
contemnor can be punished. Such a finding cannot be arrived at on ipse
dixit of the court. It must be arrived at on the materials brought on
record by the parties.
Yet again in Anil Ratan Sarkar & Ors. v. Hirak Ghosh & Ors. [(2002)
(4) SCC 21], it was opined :
“15. It may also be noticed at this juncture that mere
disobedience of an order may not be sufficient to amount to a
‘civil contempt’ within the meaning of Section 2(b) of the Act
of 1971 – the element of willingness is an indispensable
requirement to bring home the charge within the meaning of
the Act and lastly, in the event two interpretations are possible
and the action of the alleged contemnor pertains to one such
interpretation – the act or acts cannot be ascribed to be
otherwise contumacious in nature. A doubt in the matter as
regards the willful nature of the conduct if raised, question of
success in a contempt petition would not arise.”
25. Recently the Apex Court in case of Dr. U.N. Bora, Ex. Chief
Executive Officer and others Vs. Assam Roller Flour Mills
Association and another 2022 (1) SCC 101, held that wilful
disobedience will arise only where the action is deliberate, conscious and
intentional. The Court further held that a roving inquiry is not expected by
the contempt Court and it cannot go beyond the very judgment which is
alleged to be violated. The relevant paragraph no. 8 is extracted
“8. We are dealing with a civil contempt. The Contempt of Courts Act,
1971 explains a civil contempt to mean a willful disobedience of a
decision of the Court. Therefore, what is relevant is the “willful”
disobedience. Knowledge acquires substantial importance qua a
contempt order. Merely because a subordinate official acted in disregard
of an order passed by the Court, a liability cannot be fastened on a
higher official in the absence of knowledge. When two views are
possible, the element of willfulness vanishes as it involves a mental
element. It is a deliberate, conscious and intentional act. What is
required is a proof beyond reasonable doubt since the proceedings are
quasi-criminal in nature. Similarly, when a distinct mechanism is
provided and that too, in the same judgment alleged to have been
violated, a party has to exhaust the same before approaching the court in
exercise of its jurisdiction under the Contempt of Courts Act, 1971. It is
well open to the said party to contend that the benefit of the order passed
has not been actually given, through separate proceedings while seeking
appropriate relief but certainly not by way of a contempt proceeding.
While dealing with a contempt petition, the Court is not expected to
conduct a roving inquiry and go beyond the very judgment which was
allegedly violated. The said principle has to be applied with more vigor
when disputed questions of facts are involved and they were raised
earlier but consciously not dealt with by creating a specific forum to
decide the original proceedings.”
26. Thus, it is clear that unless and until the disobedience is wilful on the
part of the contemnor, the contempt Court cannot punish for deliberate
and wilful disobedience of the order alleged.
27. In the present case the order of the writ Court was specific to the
extent that the Special Land Acquisition Officer was required to
redetermine the award by awarding the market value of the land as on
01.01.2014, under the provisions of the Act of 2013. The said exercise
was completed by the officer concerned on 06.05.2022 and the award was
28. The entire case of the applicant hinges around the action of the State
and the Authority that they have lingered on the matter by litigating before
the Apex Court on various occasions and despite the dismissal of their
petitions by the Apex Court, award was not being made. Moreover, the
applicant has come up with the case that earlier proposed award was made
by the Special Land Acquisition Officer on 29.05.2019 at the rate of Rs.
23317.84/- per square meter but the same was not declared and after a
long gap it was declared on 06.05.2022 at the rate of Rs. 2626.25/- per
square meter which was in violation of the order of writ Court.
29. This Court feels that the argument raised at the behest of the
applicant’s counsel does not have any legs to stand, as it was only a
proposed award which was later on modified on the application of the
Authority and a six member committee was constituted wherein the
recommendation was made for making the award at the rate of Rs.
2626.25/- per square meter and final award was declared and passed on
30. Whether the rate of compensation in the award is acceptable to the
applicant or not is a disputed question of fact which cannot be raised and
looked into by this Court exercising power under the Act of 1971.
Moreover, once the final award has been made pursuant to the directions
of the Division Bench of this Court under the Act of 2013, the applicants
have a statutory remedy of filing reference before the concerned authority
under Section 64 of the Act of 2013.
31. The Apex Court had cleared the air so far as the indulgence of
contempt Court is concerned, and in case of           Prithawi Nath Ram
(Supra) and Dr. U.N. Bora (Supra) had held that no roving inquiry can
be done while exercising jurisdiction under Section 12 of the Act of 1971.
32. The judgment of the writ Court dated 09.05.2017 was only to the
extent of redetermining the award by Special Land Acquisition Officer on
the basis of the market value of the land as on 01.01.2014 under the Act of
2013, which the authorities have complied with and have declared the
award on 06.05.2022. Any grievance against the said award can be
redressed by way of approaching the forum provided under the Act of
2013 by the applicants.
33. Disputed question of fact, such as the rate of compensation to be
payable to the applicant for the land acquired cannot be gone into by a
contempt Court and it is for the authority as provided under Section 64 of
the Act of 2013 to deal and decide once a reference is made by affording
an opportunity to the applicants by placing material proof substantiating
their claim. The role of the contempt Court comes to an end once the
order of writ Court stands complied by the authorities.
34. Considering the facts and circumstances of the case, this Court finds
that no case for contempt having been made out once the final award was
made and published on 06.05.2022, the order of writ Court dated
09.05.2017 stands complied.
35. Contempt application having been rendered infructuous, stands dismissed.
36. Before parting with the matter, the Court wants to record its
displeasure to the conduct of Additional Advocate General Sri M.C.
Chaturvedi who made a request when the judgment was reserved for
recording his appearance not only for the State of U.P. but also for the
37. Once Sri Ravi Kant, learned Senior Counsel, has appeared and argued
on behalf of the Authority, no question arose for recording the name of
Additional Advocate General for his appearance on behalf of the
Authority also.
38. This Court is pained to take note of the fact that the State is having six
Additional Advocate General in the Allahabad High Court and six
Additional Advocate General at the Lucknow Bench of this Court.
Moreover, there are eight Chief Standing Counsel at Allahabad High
Court and 10 Chief Standing Counsel at the Lucknow Bench, apart from
number of Additional Chief Standing Counsel, Standing Counsel and
39. It has become a routine feature in this Court that Additional Advocate
General and the Chief Standing Counsel who are appointed by the State
Government to represent their case in the Allahabad High Court are also
holding brief of various development authorities and the corporations.
Though, there is no bar for the same, but these counsel are raising bills
from the State as well as the development authorities.
40. This Court also finds that in important matters most of these
Additional Advocate Generals and Chief Standing Counsel are not
appearing and the cases are going unrepresented on behalf of the State,
and their only interest is in appearing in the matters of development
authorities and corporations. There are huge number of cases where the
assistance from the State side is needed but the assistance is not available
to the Court. If the Additional Advocate Generals and Chief Standing
Counsel have sufficient time to represent the development authorities and
corporations, then there is no need for the State to have such large panels
of lawyers and incur huge financial liability. After all it is the tax payers
money which is being used in the payment of State counsel. This Court
also wants to bring to the notice of the Government that there is lot of
outsourcing of the lawyers on behalf of State and its various authorities
and corporations and a big amount of tax payers money is being used.
41. It is expected from the State to have a balance and competent panel of
lawyers without any need of assistance from outsiders. The appearance of
lawyers not from the panel of the State shows that the lawyers empanelled
with the State don't have much competence to defend the State and its
authorities and corporations.
42. In the present case if two bills are raised by the one counsel, one from
the State side and other from the development authority, it shows his
misconduct. How a counsel can raise two bills one for representing the
State as Additional Advocate General and other from the development
authority i.e. Ghaziabad Development Authority. In case, any such bills
have been raised by any Additional Advocate General or Chief Standing
Counsel from the State and development authority or corporation of the
State in one case, the said amount should be recovered from him as it is
tax payers money which cannot be misused.
43. A letter of the Special Secretary, Law Department, Government of
U.P. dated 21.02.2022 has been brought to the notice of the Court wherein
two Additional Advocate Generals of the State have been granted the
power to receive the notices in contempt matters. The said letter dated
21.02.2022 issued by the officer concerned is extracted hereasunder;
44. This Court is stunned to read the above quoted letter, how a Special
Secretary of the State can issue such order. In contempt matters the
