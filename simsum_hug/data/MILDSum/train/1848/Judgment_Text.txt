The Special Commissioner, Sabarimala, has filed this
report   regarding    the chain   service provided   by  KSRTC
between Nilakkal and Pampa.
2.    On 04.12.2021, when this report came up for
consideration, the learned Senior Government Pleader for
respondents 1 to 3 and 6 and also the respective Standing
Counsel for KSRTC and Travancore Devaswom Board sought
time to get instructions.
3.    On 06.12.2021, when this report came up for
further consideration, the learned State Attorney submitted
that in addition to nine verification centres at Nilakkal, three
more centres will be started by 07.12.2021 for verification of
Virtual-Q coupons and Covid Vaccination/test certificates at
Nilakkal in order to avoid delay. Four more spot booking
centres at Thripunithura, Kodungallur, Chottanikkara and
Thiruvilwamala are being opened under Cochin Devaswom
Board.    The    learned  Standing    Counsel   for  Travancore
Devaswom Board pointed out that the number of pilgrims
having Darshan at Sabarimala per day is now in the range of
38,000 – 40,000. Then the learned State Attorney submitted
that a decision shall be taken in the joint meeting of all
concerned including Travancore Devaswom Board on the
question as to whether the number of pilgrims permitted to
Sabarimala Darshan to be hiked and the said fact shall be
intimated to this Court. The learned Standing Counsel for
KSRTC submitted that the Corporation will provide group
booking facility for pilgrims so that the pilgrims of particular
groups can travel in the very same vehicle.
4.    A statement has been filed on behalf of the 4th
respondent KSRTC. Paragraphs 8 and 9 of the said statement
“8. It is submitted that the fares of stage carriages are
fixed by the state government from time to time. The
Corporations has absolutely no authority to fix the price
or to levy an increased fare. The latest fare revision was
in the month of July 2021 and the Government has
published a G.O. No.37/2000 dated 3/7/2020 revising
the fare of the stage carriages. A true copy of the GO.
37/2020/Tran dated 3/7/2020 is produced herewith and
marked as Annexure R4(A). As per the said notification
considering various factors like the raise in the price of
diesel which effect the operational cost, the minimum
fare is fixed as Rs.13/- for the first 2.5 kms and Rs.1/-
for every additional kilometre for JnNURM non-A/C
buses and Rs. 26 for the first 5 kilometres as minimum
fare and Rs. 1.87 for every additional kilometre for
JnNURM A/C buses. In addition to the above, for buses
plying in ghat sector an additional 25% can be levied on
the total price and an additional 30% can be levied for
fare and festivals for both JnNURM A/C and non A/C
buses. Additionally, passengers' insurance cess of Rs.3/-
for JnNURM non-A/C and Rs. 10/- for JnNURM A/C buses
can be levied by the Corporation and for that each
passenger is covered for an insurance of Rs. 3,00,000/-.
9. It is submitted that the distance between Nilakkal to
Pamba is 22.1 kilometres and in fact, when the fare is
calculated as per the above notification the Corporations
should ideally charge Rs. 56/- for JnNURM non A/C
buses and Rs.106/- for JnNURM A/C buses. But, the
Corporation is only charging Rs. 50/- for JnNURM non-
A/C buses and Rs.80/- for JnNURM A/C buses, i.e., at a
much     reduced   rate.   The   chart  showing     the  fare
Calculation of fare for JnNURM Non A/C
Minimum Fare - 13 for 2.5 km =        13 for first 2.5 k.m
KM fare         -  1/- per km    =    19.6 for 19.6 km
30% extra for fare and festival    =    12.225
(as per H & item No.31 of schedule
Fare collected by KSRTC            =    Rs.50/-
Calculation of fare for JnNURM A/C
Minimum Fare - Rs.26 for 5 km    =   26 for first 5 km
KM fare - Rs.1.874/- per km     =    31.977 for 17.1 km
(as per B of G.O.37/2020)       =    14.49
30% extra for fare and festival    =    21.74
(as per H & item No.31 of schedule
Fare collected by KSRTC            =    Rs.80/-”
5. Heard the learned State Attorney, the learned
Standing    Counsel     for Travancore Devaswom Board, the
learned Standing Counsel for KSRTC and also the learned
Amicus Curiae for the Special Commissioner, Sabarimala.
6.    Insofar as the fare collected by KSRTC for JnNURM
Non-A/C buses and JnNURM A/C buses at the rate of Rs.50
and Rs.80 respectively is concerned, the learned Standing
Counsel for Travancore Devaswom Board and also the learned
Amicus Curiae would point out that 30% extra fare for festival
occasions is charged at the rate of Rs.12.225 for Non A/C
buses and at the rate of Rs.21.74 for A/C buses.
7.    The learned Standing Counsel for KSRTC, after
referring      to    Clause     H     of     Annexure     R4(a),
G.O.No.37/2020/Tran dated 03.07.2020 and also the schedule
to that notification (Serial No.31), would point out that in
respect of service operated in connection with Mandalapooja
at Sabarimala, during November/December (55 days), KSRTC
may realise 30% of the rates, in addition to the rates of fares
fixed for the respective class of services. In terms of Annexure
R4(a), KSRTC is charging 25% extra for Ghat sector and 30%
extra for festival seasons. Though KSRTC is entitled to collect
a sum of Rs.56/- and Rs.106/- respectively as fare for Non-
A/C and A/C buses respectively, the actual fare collected by
KSRTC is only Rs.50/- and Rs.80/- respectively.
8.    The    learned   Standing     Counsel for  Travancore
Devaswom Board would point out that the collection of 30%
fare for festival in terms of Annexure R4(a) notification has to
be calculated with reference to the original fare of Rs.32.6 and
not with reference to the total fare after adding 25% extra for
Ghat sector. Therefore, 30% extra that can be charged for
Non A/C buses comes to Rs.9.78 (32.6/100x30) as against
Rs.12.225 and that for A/C buses it is only Rs.17.39
(57.977/100x30) as against Rs.21.74. This would result in an
excess fare of Rs.2.445 and Rs.4.35 respectively in the case
of Non-A/C and A/C buses respectively.
9.    As pointed out by the learned Standing Counsel for
KSRTC, though going by Annexure R4(a), 30% extra has to be
calculated from the original fare, insofar as fare for Non-A/C
and A/C buses are concerned, it is not having an impact since
as against Rs.56/- and Rs.106/-, the fare collected by KSRTC
is only Rs.50/- and Rs.80/- respectively.
10.   In   the   statement    filed  on  behalf of  the  4 th
respondent KSRTC, it is stated that 80 non A/C buses and 40
A/C buses are allotted for Nilakkal-Pumpa services and
additional crew of 10 drivers and conductors are also posted
for the said service due to increase in the number of pilgrims.
375 buses have been allotted to ply during Makaravilakku
season and for the period from 14.11.2021 to 01.12.2021
approximately 4,52,698 pilgrims have utilised the services of
KSRTC in Nilakkal-Pampa-Nilakkal route. In addition to 128
buses operating from Nilakkal to various places, KSRTC is
considering    the  scope  of  increasing services  to   Palani,
Coimbaore and Thenkasi and also to extend its services to
Madurai and Chennai as well.
11.   Having considered the submissions made by the
learned counsel on both sides, we find that necessary
arrangements have already been made by KSRTC and also the
Travancore Devaswom Board for transportation of pilgrims
from Nilakkal to Pampa and back.
12.   The learned State Attorney would submit that
concerned enforcing agencies shall take necessary steps to
ensure that there is no violation of Covid-19 protocol insofar
as the transportation of pilgrims through KSRTC buses are
13.  Regarding group booking in Virtual-Q platform, the
learned State Attorney would submit that such facility was
stopped when it was noticed that it is being misused by
certain travel agencies. Pilgrims coming from other States as
a group of 40 or 50 persons, holding virtual-Q coupons, will be
permitted to proceed to Sannidhanam even beyond the time
limit prescribed in the respective coupons, subject to the
availability of open slots.
14.  The learned Standing Counsel for KSRTC would
submit that if any request is made by groups having persons
minimum 40 in number, they will be permitted to be carried in
single bus from Nilakkal to Pampa and back. Such groups will
also have the facility for online booking through KSRTC Web
15.  The State and also Travancore Devaswom Board to
give wide publicity through print and visual media about the
aforesaid facilities available to pilgrims, so that more number
of devotees can have Sabarimala Darshan. In case of any
difficulties faced by the devotees, it is for the officers
concerned     to    report  the   said    facts   to the   Special
Commissioner or the Executive Officer so as to enable them to
bring it to the notice of this Court for appropriate orders.
With the above directions, this report is closed.
