7. It is alleged that the aforesaid vehicle was recovered from Mohali,
Punjab, which was being used by the accused-applicant and his
henchmen for going to the court from jail. His henchmen would travel
in the said ambulance armed with sophisticated weapons to escort
8. It is irony and tragedy of the Indian republic and biggest scar on
Indian democracy that criminals like the present accused-applicant are
the law-makers. This Court in its judgment and order dated 7.6.2022
passed in Criminal Misc. Bail Application No.5473 of 2022 while
taking serious view on increasing criminalisaiton of politics and
criminals reaching Parliament and State Legislature, has observed as
“16. No one can dispute that the present day politics is caught
in crime, identity, patronage, muscle and money network.
Nexus between crime and politics is serious threat to
democratic values and governance based on rule of law.
Elections of Parliament and State Legislature and even for
local bodies and panchayats are very expensive affairs. The
record would show that the elected members of Lok Sabha
with criminal records are extremely wealthier candidates. For
example, in 2014 Lok Sabha election 16 out of 23 winners
having criminal charges in their credit related to murder were
multi-millionaire. After candidates get re-elected, their wealth
and income grows manyfold which is evident from the fact that
in 2014, 165 M.Ps. who got re-elected, their average wealth
growth was Rs.7.5 Crores in 5 years.
17. Earlier, ''Bahubalis' and other criminals used to provide
support to candidates on various considerations including
caste, religion and political shelter but now criminals
themselves are entering into politics and getting elected as the
political parties do not have any inhibition in giving tickets to
candidates with criminal background including those having
heinous offence(s) registered against them. Confirmed
criminal history sheeters and even those who are behind bars
are given tickets by different political parties and surprisingly
some of them get elected as well.
18. It is the responsibility of the Parliament to show its
collective will to restrain the criminals from entering into the
politics, Parliament or legislature to save democracy and the
country governed on democratic principles and rule of law.
19. There is responsibility of civil society as well to rise above
the parochial and narrow considerations of caste, community
etc and to ensure that a candidate with criminal background
does not get elected. Criminalization of politics and
corruption in public life have become the biggest threats to
idea of India, its democratic polity and world's largest
democracy. There is an unholy alliance between organized
crime, the politicians and the bureaucrats and this nexus
between them have become pervasive reality. This
phenomenon has eroded the credibility, effectiveness, and
impartiality of the law enforcement agencies and
administration. This has resulted into lack of trust and
confidence in administration and justice delivery system of the
country as the accused such as the present accused-applicant
win over the witnesses, influence investigation and tamper
with the evidence by using their money, muscle and political
power. Alarming number of criminals reaching Parliament
and State Assembly is a wake up call for all. Parliament and
Election Commission of India are required to take effective
measures to wean away criminals from politics and break
unholy nexus between criminal politicians and bureaucrats.
20. This unholy nexus and unmindfulness of political
establishment is the result of reaching person like the accused-
applicant, a gangster, hardened criminal and ''Bahubali' to the
Parliament and becoming a law maker. This Court, looking at
the heinousness of offence, might of the accused, evidence
available on record, impact on society, possibility of accused
tampering with the evidence and influencing/ winning over the
witnesses by using his muscle and money power does not find
that there is a ground to enlarge the accused-applicant on bail
at this stage. This bail application is thus, rejected.”
9. Dr. Alka Rai in her statement said that under pressure and fear of
the present accused-applicant, she signed on some papers brought by
his men and her signatures were taken on the blank letter pad of the
hospital along with seal etc. She further said that she met with the
present accused-applicant in jail, and because of the manner in which
the accused-applicant insisted to buy ambulance, out of fear and terror
of the accused-applicant, she put her signatures on the papers brought
by his men. This ambulance was being used by the accused-applicant
and she could come to know this fact on 31.3.2021 that the present
accused-applicant was using the said vehicle for going to the court in
Mohali, Punjab from jail.
10. She further said that after the news channel made the disclosure of
the above incident, his men told her that what was required to be said
by her to the police. If she was asked by the investigating agency, she
would tell that she purchased the said vehicle by giving her permanent
address at Barabanki and, thereafter, she was shifted to Mau, and she
was running the ambulance from Mau itself. She was told to say that
Afsa Ansari, wife of the accused-applicant had taken the said
ambulance on rent 4-5 days before as she had to travel to Punjab to
bring back her husband, ambulance would be required as she was
having trouble/pain on her neck. Dr. Alka Rai was threatened that if
she would not tell whatever was told, her hospital and she would be
11. There are statements of other co-accused, who have corroborated
the allegation against the accused-applicant regarding purchase of the
said ambulance on the basis of the forged and fabricated documents in
the name of Dr. Alka Rai for the use of the accused-applicant.
12. Anand Yadav, one of the co-accused, had said that one Surendra
Sharma S/o Indrasen Sharma, Saleem S/o Badruddin and Firoz used
to drive the said ambulance. The accused-applicant and his men,
Afroz, Shahid and Zafar @ Chanda would keep sophisticated and
modern illegal weapons in the said ambulance, which would
accompany the accused-applicant. Once in Lucknow at Hazratganj
Crossing, one Reporter clicked the photograph of the said ambulance,
and then henchmen of the accused-applicant assaulted the said
Reporter badly. All these persons are close, confident and associate of
the accused-applicant.
13. Allegation is that the ambulance was being used by the accused-
applicant to carry his men with sophisticated arms to escort the
accused-applicant from jail to the court in order to avoid any
untoward incident. A photograph has been placed on record, which
would demonstrate that when the accused-applicant came to the court
in Mau, the said ambulance and his men accompanied him.
14. The Supreme Court recently in the case of Harjit Singh Vs.
Inderpreet Singh and others, (2021) SCC Online SC 633 has
cancelled the bail granted to the accused by the High Court
considering the criminal antecedents of the accused. Paragraphs 11
and 12 of the aforesaid judgement read as under:-
“11.From the material on record, it is clear that as and when
he is granted bail, he came out of the jail, committed another
offence and again went to jail. Even the High Court
cancelled the bail in another case vide order dated
26.07.2019 specifically observing that while on bail during
the pendency of the appeal, they were involved in other cases
of heinous crime. From the material on record, it appears
that there is a high possibility of threat and danger to the life
and safety of the appellant herein/complainant and his
family members, as is evident from the criminal history of
respondent no.1, detailed above.
12. The aforesaid relevant considerations are not at all
considered by the High Court in its true perspective. Grant of
bail to respondent no.1 herein does not appear to be in order.
The antecedents of respondent no.1 herein; the threat
perception to the appellant and his family members are also
not considered by the High Court. We are of the opinion that
the High Court has erred in granting bail to respondent no.1
herein without taking into consideration the overall facts,
otherwise having a bearing on exercise of its discretion on
the issue. The order passed by the High Court fails to notice
material facts and shows non- application of mind to the
seriousness of the crime and circumstances, which ought to
have been taken into consideration.”
15. In the case of Brijmani Devi Vs. Pappu Kumar and another;
(2022) 4 SCC 497, the Supreme                Court has held that while
considering a bail application by the Court, the due consideration,
inter alia, to be given to the criminal antecedents of the accused.
Paragraph 35 o the said judgement reads as under:-
“35. While we are conscious of the fact that liberty of an
individual is an invaluable right, at the same time while
considering an application for bail Courts cannot lose sight of
the serious nature of the accusations against an accused and
the facts that have a bearing in the case, particularly, when
the accusations may not be false, frivolous or vexatious in
nature but are supported by adequate material brought on
record so as to enable a Court to arrive at a prima facie
conclusion. While considering an application for grant of bail
a prima facie conclusion must be supported by reasons and
must be arrived at after having regard to the vital facts of the
case brought on record. Due consideration must be given to
facts suggestive of the nature of crime, the criminal
antecedents of the accused, if any, and the nature of
punishment that would follow a conviction visàvis the offence/
s alleged against an accused.”
16. The long criminal history of the accused-applicant of most heinous
offences and looking at the facts of the case that the ambulance was
allegedly being used to carry his men armed with illegal and
sophisticated weapons for his protection, this Court finds that there is
no ground to enlarge the accused-applicant on bail. The accused-
applicant commands un-parallel fear in the minds and hearts of the
people that no one dares to challenge him and his men and his politics.
If the accused-applicant is enlarged on bail, the apprehension of the
prosecution that he would tamper with the evidence and influence the
witnesses, cannot be ruled out.
17. Considering all these aspects, this Court finds no ground to
enlarge the accused-applicant on bail.
18. Bail application is accordingly rejected.
