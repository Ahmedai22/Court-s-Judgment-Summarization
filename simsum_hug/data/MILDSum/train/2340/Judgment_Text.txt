over. In case, Additional Courts are required, the High Courts and the appropriate
Government shall constitute Additional Special Court. The CBI shall ensure that
public prosecutors do not seek adjournment and the witnesses are produced
before Court on the dates fixed. In case, the accused persons do not cooperate
with the trial, the Court may consider cancellation of bail of such accused.
12. The High Courts may be requested to hear the cases where interim orders have
been passed within a time frame. The trial courts may be directed to proceed with
the trial, notwithstanding the interim order of the High Court in terms of the order
of this Hon’ble Court dated 16.09.2020 and 04.11.2020 and the judgement in the
case of Asian Resurfacing of Road Agency Private Limited v. CBI , (2018) 16 SCC
13. It is submitted that despite the aforesaid orders of this Hon’ble Court, the trial has
been withheld due to interim orders of the High Court. The Registrar General of
the High Courts may be directed to place all the matters relating to MPs/MLAs to
be placed before the Hon’ble Chief Justice of the respective High Courts on the
administrative side for issue of proper directions for listing of the cases where
interim orders are passed in cases relating to MPs and MLAs.
14. It is further submitted that trial of certain cases has been withheld due to interim
orders passed by this Hon’ble Court. The Registrar General of this Hon’ble Court
may be directed to place all the matters relating to MPs/MLAs to be placed before
the Hon’ble Chief Justice of India on the administrative side for issue of proper
directions for listing of the cases where interim orders are passed in cases relating
to MPs and MLAs.
15. Cases where investigations are pending before the Enforcement Directorate and
CBI, a Monitoring Committee may be constituted comprising of the following:
(a) Former Judge of this Hon’ble Court or the former Chief Justice of a High
(b) Director, Enforcement Directorate (or his nominee not below the rank of
(c) Director, CBI (or his nominee not below the rank of Additional Director),
(d) Home Secretary to the Government of India (or his nominee not below the
(e) a judicial officer not below the rank of District Judge to be nominated by
this Hon’ble Court.
16. The said Monitoring Committee will evaluate the reasons for the delay in

17. As per status report dated 17.08.2021, there is one Special Court for MP/MLA at
Bhopal and is presided over by Pravendra Kumar Singh who has been posted there
on 30.06.2020. During this period, the learned Special Judge has disposed of 97
cases and 324 cases are pending. Video conference facility is available in the said
Court and no judgements are pending. Status of the 324 pending cases are as
b.  Prosecution evidence                                     85 cases
(62 Magistrate + 23 Sessions, large number of them
are under Negotiable Instruments Act)
f.  Appearance of accused                                    103 cases

h.   Unregistered cases for documents and statements 68 cases
under section 200 Cr.P.C. (most of them are under
Negotiable Instrument Act and defamation under
18. The analysis of the aforesaid figure shows that a large number of cases are
concentrated in one Special Court at Bhopal. All these cases arise from different
parts of the State and it is almost impossible for the prosecution and defence to
be present in the Court from different parts of the State when the case is taken
up and is one of the main reasons for the delay.
19. As per the earlier reports filed by the High Court dated 16.10.2020, total number
of pending cases were 190 and the High Court proposed to constitute three more
Special Courts at Indore, Jabalpur and Gwalior apart from one at Bhopal. However,
no Special Courts have been constituted at Indore, Jabalpur and Gwalior in terms
of the earlier affidavit. Thus, all the cases against legislators are concentrated in
one Court at Bhopal and it is impossible for one judicial officer to decide such a
huge number of cases. The total number of cases have increased from 190 to 324
within a span of ten months.
20. It is also important to note that out of 324 pending cases, as many as 103 cases
are pending for the appearance of the accused. This also shows laxity on the part
of the prosecution to ensure attendance of the accused persons before the Court.

Jabalpur and Gwalior as per earlier status report dated 16.10.2020 within a period
of two weeks and file a compliance affidavit before this Hon’ble Court.
22. The prosecution may be directed to produce the accused persons in all cases which
are pending at the stage of appearance. In case, the accused persons do not
appear before the Special Court within two weeks; bail, if any, granted shall stand
cancelled automatically and the accused persons shall be taken into custody.

High Court, 96 judicial officers have jurisdiction to try cases against MP/MLAs, out
of which before 61 judicial officers no cases are pending before them. Total
number of pending cases are 41 and most of the Judges have 1 case pending
before them and some of them have 2 or 3. Most of the Courts have video
conferencing facility barring few of them. The following may be noted as regards
(Serial No. 16, 29, 30, 31, 74, 94 and 95)

permissible in public interest and cannot be done for political consideration. Such

power by the State in withdrawing prosecution for political and extraneous
considerations, the following direction may be law down, in addition to the

prosecutor only if the Government, in a given case, is of the opinion
that the prosecution was launched maliciously and there is no
foundation for prosecuting the accused.

individual case by the Home Secretary of the concerned State.
c. No general order can be passed for withdrawal of prosecution of any
category of persons or offences committed during a particular
period.
91. All the cases which have been withdrawn under section 321 Cr.P.C. after the order
of this Hon’ble Court dated 16.09.2020 may be examined by the respective High
Courts by exercising revisional jurisdiction under section 401 Cr.P.C. in the light of
submissions made in the preceding paragraphs.
