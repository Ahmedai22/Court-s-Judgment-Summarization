1.      The present petitions have been preferred by three students who had
appeared in the Common Entrance Test for admission to the LLB course in
Delhi University, but have been unsuccessful in securing admission therein.
2.      It is the petitioner’s case that there are a number of vacant seats across
all categories and therefore, they pray that the respondent be directed to fill

up all the 3320 seats as notified in the Admission Bulletin by conducting
further counselling sessions. The petitions are primarily opposed on the
ground that, despite availability of vacant seats, no admissions can be granted
after the cut-off date of 31.12.2021.
3.      The respondent, Faculty of Law, Delhi University (‘University’)
provides a three-year law programme (‘LLB course’) through its three
centres being Campus Law Centre, Law Centre-I, and Law Centre-II.
Admission to these institutes is based on the national entrance test held by the
respondent University conducted by the National Testing Agency (‘NTA’).
4.      Before dealing with the rival submissions of the parties on these
aspects, it may be appropriate to note the factual matrix, which for the sake of
convenience, is being noted from W.P.(C) 1035/2022.
5.      As per the PG Bulletin of Information for 2021-22 (‘Information
Bulletin’) issued by the Delhi University, the last date of admissions to PG
courses was to be 30.09.2021. It was, however, provided that this date may
be changed due to the unprecedented situation owing to the Covid-19
pandemic and the changed date was to be notified on the website of the Delhi
6.      The petitioners being desirous of obtaining admission to the LLB
course, appeared for the entrance examination for admission in the academic
session 2021-22, conducted on 29.09.2021 by the respondent through the
NTA, and as per the seat matrix released by the Faculty of Law, there were in
all 3320 seats, which included 1170 seats in the UR category. The scorecards
of the entrance exam were released on 06.11.2021 and both the petitioners
scored 232 marks out of 400 therein.
7.      Even though, as per the Information Bulletin, the last date for
admission was 30.09.2021, the first merit list for admission to the LLB
Location:               W.P.(C) 1035/2022& W.P.(C) 1903/2022                                  Page 2 of 20
Course itself was released only on 23.11.2021. This was followed by the
second merit list released on 09.12.2021, whereafter, on 15.12.2021, the
Delhi University, realising that there were still a number of unfilled vacant
seats in various Undergraduate (UG) and Postgraduate (PG) courses for the
academic session 2021-22, issued a notification dated 15.12.2021,
prescribing therein that, the last date of admission for these courses would be
8.      On 20.12.2021 a ‘Revised Notice’ was issued by the University, laying
down the guidelines for PG admissions under the last and final round of
admission, which was to include spot admissions. This notice specifically
provided that, the candidates admitted provisionally in the previous
admission rounds on the basis of undertakings, should submit their
documents, so that such cases could be closed by 22.12.2021. It was further
provided that no undertakings will be allowed in the spot round, and the all
the admissions were to be approved by 28.12.2021.
9.      Soon thereafter, Faculty of Law issued the third allocation/merit list on
27.12.2021, which was followed by a fourth merit list released on
31.12.2021. In respect of the fourth merit list, the respondent had, while
informing the candidates vide its notice dated 30.12.2021 about the fourth
counselling to be held on 31.12.2021, communicated the necessity to furnish
all relevant documents on the said date itself. As per the fourth and final
merit list, the last candidate from the unreserved category to be admitted to
the LLB Course, was a student who had a combined rank of 88, with a score
of 232, and a qualifying degree percentage of 63.03%. Even though, the
petitioners who belong to the UR category, had also obtained a score of 232
marks, they were not granted admission as they had a lower qualifying degree
percentage.

10.     Even though, some seats remained vacant after the publication of the
fourth merit list on 31.12.2021, the respondent neither issued any further
merit list, nor held any further counselling sessions. In the first week of
January 2022, the respondent issued a circular announcing therein that the
classes for the LLB course would commence on 05.01.2022; this was
followed by issuance of a centre allocation list on 05.01.2022.
11.     The petitioners, upon scrutinizing the seat matrix published by the
respondent for admission to the LLB Course, and comparing it against the
seats actually allotted to candidates as per the four published merit lists,
realised that out of the 3320 seats that were originally proposed to be filled
according to the prospectus, a number of seats across different categories had
remained vacant. The petitioner no.2 therefore, filed an RTI application dated
06.01.2022 before the respondent no.2 requesting for information on these
seats, to which no response was received by him. A similar request was also
made by the petitioner no.1 to the respondent through his email dated
07.01.2022, requesting that his candidature be considered, amongst other
candidates, against the vacant seats in the UR category. This representation
remained unanswered.
12.     The respondent thereafter, released the second centre reallocation list
on 10.01.2022, upon a perusal whereof the petitioners found that there were a
large number of vacant seats for the LLB course, including some in the UR
category. It is in these circumstances that, the petitioners have approached
this Court by way of this petition on 16.01.2022. During the pendency of the
present petition, a third and final centre allocation list was released on
13.     In support of the petition, learned counsel for the petitioner makes the
following submissions: -
Location:               W.P.(C) 1035/2022& W.P.(C) 1903/2022                                   Page 4 of 20
i.    At the outset, learned counsel for the petitioners submits that, unlike
the previous years, where the respondent would release a
consolidated list of all the students who appeared for the entrance
examination with their respective scores and rank, this year, the
respondent has only released the scores and ranks of those students
who were on the merit list for admission to the LLB Course, while
not publishing the scores and ranking of the other candidates. It is
submitted that since the petitioners have obtained the same score as
the last candidate admitted, they have reasons to believe that, if a
consolidated list containing the scores, along with the qualifying
degree percentage obtained by all aspirants had been provided, the
process of filling up seats would have been transparent, and all the
available seats would have been duly filled.
ii.    Mr. Gupta submits that in the Bulletin, as also in the seat matrix
issued by the Law Faculty, Delhi University, only cut-off date
which was specified was 30.09.2021, which too was tentative, and
the only thing which was sacrosanct was the number of seats open
for admission to LLB, which was admittedly 3320. He, thus,
contends that once it was only the number of seats that was fixed,
the respondent cannot shirk away from their duty to fill all the
available seats on the ground that some of them had become vacant
after the purported cut-off date of 30.09.2021. Once the respondent
itself had been extending the cut-off date, from time to time, and in
fact, despite a notification issued on 20.12.2021 that the last
admission in all PG courses would take place on 22.12.2021, had
proceeded to extend the said deadlines, they ought to have suitably
extended the counselling sessions to fill up the vacant seats. He

further submits, that, since LLB is a specialised professional course,
this Court has in the past, issued directions for filling up of the
vacant seats, even after the cut-off date, and that too when classes
were already underway in the respondent University. For this
purpose, he places reliance on the orders passed by a Coordinate
Bench of this Court in Manmeet Kaur Sareen vs. University of
Delhi W.P. (C) 7730/2017, and by a Division Bench of this Court
in Joginder Kumar Sukhija Vs. Union of India and Ors., WP(C)
5118/2017 on 26.09.2017.
iii.    Mr. Gupta further submits that, if the respondents had taken action
strictly in accordance with the notification dated 20.12.2021 to
cancel the admissions of students who were not able to provide the
relevant documents, before the cut-off date, candidates such as the
petitioners would have had a chance of getting admission, which
was denied to them. Therefore, if the petitioners or other candidates
have been denied an opportunity for admission, on account of
delayed cancellations of ineligible students who were unable to
provide the document by the respondent, the petitioners ought to be
considered for admission against the vacant seats. Reliance is
sought to be placed on a decision of a Coordinate Bench of this
Court in Anuj Sharma vs University of Delhi (2011) SCC Online
Del 4266, wherein the Court went on to direct the respondent to
convert the unfilled seats in the reserved categories into unreserved
seats, almost two months after the cut-off date, with a further
direction to hold special classes for the students admitted in
pursuance of the Court’s order.
Location:               W.P.(C) 1035/2022& W.P.(C) 1903/2022                                   Page 6 of 20
iv.     He submits that the respondent has failed to disclose the exact
number of candidates in the fourth merit list published on
31.12.2021, before the cut-off date of 31.12.2021 for the admission
process, thus, arbitrarily denying admission to those candidates who
were next in line during the admission process, including the
petitioners. He further submits that the respondent has itself
admitted that, even before 31.12.2021, there were some vacant seats
in categories other than the UR category, which shows that the
University has not taken every endeavour to fill up all the vacant
seats before the admission cut-off date, in violation of its mandate.
v.     He further submits that, once the respondent has itself acted in
breach of their own guidelines, and failed to ensure that the
candidates who were granted admission prior to 31.12.2021,
submitted all their relevant documents within time, it is evident that
candidates like the petitioners, have been deprived of admission
against these seats, which would have become vacant even before
31.12.2021, if timely action had been taken by the respondent to
cancel the admission of those ineligible candidates. This fact has
come to the knowledge of the petitioners only after the release of
the centre allocation lists on 05.01.2022, 10.01.2022 and
19.01.2022. He, therefore, prays that the respondents be directed to
fill all the vacant seats at the earliest so that the students do not miss
any more classes, which have already commenced on 06.01.2022.
14. On the other hand, Mr. Mohinder J Rupal, learned counsel for the
respondent, while vehemently opposing the petition, has made the following
Location:               W.P.(C) 1035/2022& W.P.(C) 1903/2022                                        Page 7 of 20
i.      Mr. Rupal submits that, having been unable to secure admission
before the cut-off date of 31.12.2021, on account of being lower in
the merit list, the petitioners cannot now claim that they must be
granted admission against the seat which may have become vacant
after the cut-off date. He contends that, the petitioners having not
assailed the notification dated 15.12.2021 issued by the respondent,
vide which the cut-off date for admission was prescribed, cannot
now turn around to state that the said cut-off date should be ignored
and they should be granted admission at this belated stage, when
classes have already commenced on 06.01.2022. By placing
reliance on the decision in Rithambara Garg vs. University of
Delhi & Ors. 2013 SCC Online Del 1902, he submits that the cut-
off date once prescribed in the Prospectus is sacrosanct and cannot
be tinkered with.
ii.      He further submits that the essentiality of the cut-off date is to
ensure that the admission process is completed in a suitable time
frame and does not go on endlessly. Moreover, the petitioners do
not have any vested right to seek admission after the process of
admission is already over. By placing reliance on the decision of
the Division Bench of this Court in Maharaja Agrasen Institute of
Technology vs. Guru Govind Singh Indraprastha University, LPA
952/2004, and the decision of the Apex Court in Neelu Arora v.
Union of India (2003) 3 SCC 366 he contends that, while the
process of counselling is designed to maximize the seat allocation,
it cannot be continued endlessly, and should have a definite point
of termination. He further submits that, the mere possibility of any
hardship to the petitioners cannot be a ground to interfere with the
Location:               W.P.(C) 1035/2022& W.P.(C) 1903/2022                                   Page 8 of 20
policy decision of the University not to grant any admissions after
31.12.2021, for which purpose he relies on the decision in Sandhya
Kabra and Ors. vs. University of AIR 1993 Delhi 40.
iii.      He further submits that, even as per the petitioner’s own showing,
there were only 3 vacant seats in the UR category as of 01.01.2022,
and if the petitioners’ case for grant of admission against the vacant
seats was considered, the petitioners still do not stand any chance
of qualifying for the same, as there are candidates who have a
better percentage of marks than those of the petitioners who would
be eligible for admission. He, therefore, prays that the writ petition
be dismissed.
15.     Having considered the submissions of the parties and perused the
record, I find that the foremost issue that needs to be considered is, whether
the last cut-off date of 31.12.2021 was as sacrosanct as is being argued by the
learned counsel for the respondent, and therefore the respondent, despite
being aware that there are a number of vacant seats, cannot fill those vacant
seats.
16.     Before dealing with the rival submissions, I may note that in a marked
departure from the practice being followed in the past, the respondent has, in
the present academic session instead of issuing any consolidated list of scores
and ranks of all the candidates, only informed them about their respective
scores. Resultantly, only the rankings alongwith scores of only those students
whose names appear in the merit list, were released from time to time. It
appears that the petitioner no.2 had also preferred an RTI Application dated
13.12.2021 before the NTA, with a request for supply of a consolidated list of
the candidates who had appeared for the entrance examination, along with
their marks and rankings, which request was, however, rejected.

17.     In order to determine whether the cut-off date for the admission to the
LLB course was sacrosanct and ought not to be interfered with despite the
admitted position that there are a number of vacant seats, it would be apposite
to begin by noting clause 11.8 of the Information Bulletin for the academic
session 2021-22 released by the Delhi University, which refers to the cut-off
date. The same reads as under: -
“Since 2011 the University Administration has discontinued the
Practice of Condonation of Delay in Admission. Therefore, as
per the University of Delhi Ordinance — II, admission in all the
Postgraduate Programmes are to be finalised by 31st August of
the concerned Academic Session. However, due to the ongoing
situation due to COVID, and as pe UGC Notification dated 16th
July the last date of admissions will be 30.09.2021 This date may
change due to the unprecedented situation owing to the
pandemic. Any change in date will be notified on DU website
www.du.ac.in.”
18. I may now refer to the notification dated 15.12.2021 issued by the
respondent, which is the sheer anchor of the respondent’s case as it is this
notification which prescribed that the cut-off date for admission for all
undergraduate and postgraduate courses would be 31.12.2021. The same
It is notified that the last date of Admission for all
Undergraduate and Postgraduate courses of the University of
Delhi for the Academic Session 2021-2022 shall be 31st
19. A reference may also be made to the notification issued by the Delhi
University on 20.12.2021, wherein the need to ensure that all students

produce their certificates well within time, was emphasised. The relevant
notification is reproduced hereinunder-

20. A combined reading of the clause 11.8 of the Information Bulletin, and
the notification dated 15.12.2021 makes it evident that, while prescribing the
date of 30.09.2021 in the Information Bulletin, the respondent was aware, on
account of the unprecedented situation owing to the covid-19 pandemic, that
the deadline of admission may be required to be changed. It is the common
case of the parties that considering the effect of the ongoing covid pandemic,
and the well-known fact that the academic calendars across all courses were
getting delayed, the Delhi University itself postponed the cut-off dates from
time to time, which it is the respondent’s stand, was finally extended to
31.12.2021. I may also note that the Bulletin did not specify the number of
counselling sessions which were to be conducted to fill the seats in LLB, in
any case, nothing has been brought on record to show that it was pre-decided
that there would be only four counselling sessions, as have, in fact been
conducted. It is, thus, evident that neither was any final cut-off date specified
in the Information Bulletin, nor were the number of counselling sessions to
be held, prescribed in the same. On the other hand, it emerges that, from time
to time, not only was the cut-off date extended by the respondent, but even
successive counselling sessions were held from time to time, depending upon
the availability of the vacant seats. Thus, I have no hesitation, in accepting
the petitioner’s plea, that at the time of issuing the information Bulletin, the
respondent itself did not envisage any final cut-off-date, or the number of
counselling sessions.
21. There can be no dispute with the proposition that the conditions
prescribed in the prospectus are sacrosanct, and therefore, the cut-off date
prescribed therein should not be normally altered. In this regard, Mr. Rupal,
has in my view, rightly placed reliance on the decision in Rithambarha Garg
Location:               W.P.(C) 1035/2022& W.P.(C) 1903/2022                                  Page 13 of 20
(supra), as also in Maharaja Agrasen (supra). However, as noted
hereinabove, I find that, in the present case, the Information Bulletin did not
give any final cut-off date, and in fact, the tentative cut-off dates announced
by the respondent were also being extended from time to time. I, therefore,
fail to appreciate as to how, these decisions, which related to cases where
fixed dates were prescribed in the prospectus, forward the case of the
respondent. On the other hand, I find, that LLB being a standalone
specialised course, and the admitted position that additional admissions to
this course at this stage will not, in any manner, lead to dropouts in other
courses/institutions, which was one of the primary considerations for the
Court’s decision to interfere with the prescribed cut-off date in the case of
Maharaja Agrasen (supra). Reference may be made to paras 37 and 38
thereof, which read as under: -
37. If one keeps above observations in mind, it would be
apparent that the system of counselling itself is designed to
maximize allocation of seats in various institutions. However,
that cannot imply that the process is endless; it has a definite
terming quo in point of time. In the present case, the date of
commencement of classes was 02.08.2004 In spite of this, the
second round of counselling was envisaged and that terminated
on 28.08.2004. This fact is essential while considering the
challenge to the reasonableness of the impugned condition. It
shows that outer limit of acceptability of a student's absence from
class after they commenced in the first term was about four
weeks.
38. Another aspect of the matter is that the prohibition from
filling vacant seats after the second counselling, appears to be
dictated by certain policy considerations. The permissibility of a
further round would mean that there would be further drop ours
from other institutions leading to complaints by them and
uncertainty in the admission process, as described in the
judgment quoted above. Such an uncertainty at the
Location:               W.P.(C) 1035/2022& W.P.(C) 1903/2022                                   Page 14 of 20
commencement of the academic year itself, in our opinion, is
unacceptable.
22. On the other hand, I find that, keeping in view the well-known fact that
the Faculty of Law, Delhi University, is a prestigious institute, having world-
wide repute, the endeavour of this Court has always been to maximize the
number of seats in this course, which is evident from the directions of the
Division Bench of this Court in Joginder Kumar Sukhija (supra) to include
the supernumerary seats in the seat matrix. This direction was issued not only
much after the cut-off date, but almost four weeks after the classes had
started. It may be apposite to note the relevant directions of the Division
Bench, which read as under:-
“7. It is also complained by the applicants that the respondent
no.3 has not filled-up the vacancies as per its past admissions
and notifications. The applicant has pointed out that as in the
year 2016-17, the respondents have this year also erroneously
included the supernumerary seats as part of the total of 2310
seats to which admissions have been effected and thereby closed
the admissions after filling only 2310 seats. It is submitted that
the University of Delhi was required to admit 301 candidates in
the reserved categories as supernumeraries over and above 2310
seats. Inasmuch as the figure of 2310 and the supernumerary
seats of 301 are not the factual basis and that the University of
Delhi has been admitting the students to such number of seats
since 2008, and also so notified in 2015-16, it cannot be denied
that the same has to be implemented.
There is therefore, substance in this grievance.
9. In view of the above, the respondent nos.3 and 4 are directed
to ensure that 2310 candidates are admitted to the LL.B. course
and the supernumerary candidates would be admitted over and
above 2310 candidates.
10. It is made clear that in case supernumerary candidates have
been admitted as part of the 2310 candidates, the respondent
nos.3 and 4 shall make the appropriate adjustments so as to
Location:               W.P.(C) 1035/2022& W.P.(C) 1903/2022                                 Page 15 of 20
ensure that 2310 candidates are admitted and that the
supernumerary candidates are adjusted over and above and
beyond this number of 2310.
11. Inasmuch as the applicants are before the court and the
matters have been pending for consideration before us, the cut-
off date of 31st of August 2017 shall not come in the way of these
candidates being permitted to join the LL.B. course.
12. In case, there is any deficiency in the completion of the
curriculum by the candidates admitted pursuant to this order, the
respondent nos.3 and 4 shall ensure that they are given an
opportunity to make good the deficient classes and course, if any.
13. The respondent nos.3 and 4 shall ensure that all eligible
candidates in the order of merit shall be considered and granted
admission pursuant to the order which has been passed today.”
23. Reference may also be made to the observations of a Coordinate Bench
of this Court in Anuj Sharma (supra), para 7 and 8 whereof read as under: -
7. The plea taken by the respondent that the academic session of
the LLB first year course has already begun does not cut any ice
in view of the fact that the petitioner cannot be made to suffer for
no fault on their part. Ordinarily, the mid-stream admissions are
not the preferred norm, but in the case like the present one where
there is a sea of opportunity but is not open to the ones willing to
avail, due to the unreasonableness and high handedness of the
respondents, the court will lean in the favour where justice can
be done and the principles of equity and good conscience are the
torch bearers.
8. The Courts have also consistently held that every endeavour
by the University and all other institutions should be made to fill
all the seats as wastage of seats is not only at the cost of the
public exchequer but at the cost of depriving a number of
aspiring students struggling to get admission in coveted
institutions and universities such as the Delhi University, which
is a dream of many.”
24. Furthermore, the respondents have also not denied that in Manmeet
Kaur(supra), directions for grant of admission to her, were issued much after

the cut-off date, though they have tried to justify the same by urging that a
direction for reserving a seat in her favour had already been passed earlier.
Once admission was granted after the cut-off date, the mere direction issued
earlier to reserve a seat for her would not be material, as the fact remains that
she too joined the course after the classes had already commenced. The
relevant extract of the relevant directions issued by the Court in Manmeet
Kaur (supra) read as under-
“The ends of justice would definitely not be served if available
seats in educational institutions are allowed to go waste; this
could also not have been the intention of the educational
legislators; admitted position being that these seats would
continue to remain vacant as they would not be carried forward
to the next year. This would be a denial of opportunity to an
otherwise meritorious student.
Petitioner has applied for her choice in Law Centre-2. There are
8 vacant seats in that centre; 7 seats in the Scheduled Tribes
category and 1 seat in the Foreign National category.
The petitioner be granted admission in any of the aforenoted 8
vacant seats. A writ of mandamus is issued accordingly to
enforce the aforenoted directions. Application disposed of.”
25. The petitioners vehemently contend that, the respondent has also faulted
in not cancelling the admissions of ineligible students before the cut-off date
and, therefore, there is no reason as to why, they should not fill up the large
number of unfilled seats, by taking into account the fact that in December
2021, there was a huge surge in the covid cases. Though, the respondent has
sought to justify, that there was no wilful failure on its part to cancel the
admissions of students who had not produced the documents in time, in the
light of my conclusions hereinabove, I do not deem it necessary to enter into
this disputed question of fact. However, it may be appropriate to note that
even as per the respondent’s own stand some admissions have been cancelled

on 01.01.2022 and thereafter; thus, evidently there are vacant seats available.
I am, therefore, inclined to accept the petitioners’ submission that if these
admissions had been cancelled prior to 31.12.2021, the unfilled seats would
have substantially reduced, as the respondent would then have been in a
position to offer these seats to other students in the merit list. On this account
also, the candidates who could have been accommodated in these seats,
deserve to be granted relief. In this regard, reference may be made to the
decision of a Coordinate Bench of this Court in Saumya Chopra vs.
University of Delhi 2018 SCC Online Del 13061, the relevant extract
whereof reads as under: -
“22. Quite clearly, the italicised words, in the above-extracted
passage, from Neelu Arora (supra), indicate that the said
judgment cannot be of any assistance, insofar as the controversy
in issue in the present case is concerned. Had the petitioners
limited their case to a bald claim to the vacancies which had
remained unfilled, after the fifth round of counselling was over,
and the cut-off date expired, solely on the ground that all unfilled
seats ought to have been filled up, then, perhaps, Neelu Arora
(supra) might have stood in their way. The petitioners do not,
however, as has already been noted herein above, pitch their
case that high. Their claim is to the vacancies remaining unfilled
after the third round of counselling and before the arrival of the
cut-off date for effecting admissions. Their case is that, had these
vacancies not been filled up by inviting the earlier “no show”
candidates, they would have succeeded in securing admission, by
dint of merit. The reliance, by Mr. Rupal, on Neelu Arora (supra)
has, therefore, to be rejected as misconceived.
25. Resultantly, the act of the University in inviting, for its fourth
and fifth counselling, candidates who had not shown up, despite
their names having figured in the first three Admission Lists, has
to be held as illegal and arbitrary, and starkly violative of Clause
(iii) of its own Admission Bulletin. The University would
necessarily have, therefore, revisit the said decision. At the same
time, it would not be in the interests of anyone - far less, in the
Location:               W.P.(C) 1035/2022& W.P.(C) 1903/2022                                     Page 18 of 20
interests of justice - to direct the entire exercise of fourth and
fifth counselling to be held afresh. Neither would it be in the
interests of justice to interfere with the admissions of the students
who had not shown up consequent to the first three Admission
Lists, despite their names having figured therein, and who
obtained admission pursuant to the fourth or the fifth Admission
Lists. These students cannot be faulted for having responded to
the Notice put up by the University, even if the Notice were, ex
facie, contrary to the Admission Bulletin. As sufficient vacancies,
apparently, still remain unfilled, both in the General as well as
the OBC categories, to accommodate the petitioners before this
Court, creation of any supernumerary seats, for the said purpose,
26. There is no gainsaying, that the aim of counselling in any institution is
to fill up the maximum available seats by granting opportunity to deserving
and eligible candidates to gain education and knowledge. Unarguably, Delhi
University is one of premier institutes in imparting education across the
country, and it is a dream for many students to get their education from a
university of this repute. It would be unfair to the candidates if seats in such a
prestigious institute are allowed to go to waste, despite there being candidates
with merit to fill the same. As noted above, this Court, had not only in the
year 2011, in the case of Anuj Sharma (supra), but again in the year 2017, in
the case of Manmeet Kaur and Joginder Kumar Sukhija (supra), directed
grant of admission much after the commencement of the classes. I do not see
as to why this course of action should not be followed in the present situation,
and that too when the entire world, more especially the students, are reeling
under the effect of the covid-19 pandemic.
27. I am also of the considered view that the petitioners, who are young
students, and have showed their grit and determination in clearing the
entrance examination, should not be denied the opportunity to pursue the
LLB degree, especially keeping in view the devastating impact of the Covid-
Location:               W.P.(C) 1035/2022& W.P.(C) 1903/2022                                     Page 19 of 20
19 pandemic which has painted a rather gloomy picture for many students, as
their studies have faced constant disruption. The unwillingness on the part of
the respondent to consider filling the vacant seats on the ground of strict
adherence to the last cut-off date cannot be accepted, when the respondent
itself has neither followed the cut-off date mentioned in the Information
Bulletin, nor has it followed the guidelines issued on 20.12.2021, which
mandated that admissions of students who do not provide the relevant
documents, should be cancelled.
28. For the aforesaid reasons, the writ petitions deserve to be allowed, and
are accordingly, allowed, by directing the respondent to fill up within two
weeks all the available vacant seats in LLB course across all the categories,
by considering all eligible candidates, including the petitioners, as per their
merit. Needless to state, if there is any requirement for these students to
attend additional classes, the respondent will ensure that the same are
conducted well within time.
