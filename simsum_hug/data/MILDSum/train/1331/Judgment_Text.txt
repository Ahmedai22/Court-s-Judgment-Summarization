CM APPL. 2/2023 (under Sec. 151 of CPC for interim relief)
4.      Petitioner, a third-year student of LL.B. at Campus Law Centre,
University of Delhi, has been detained from appearing in V-semester
examinations by virtue of Detention List dated 30th December, 2022 and
Revised Detention List dated 31st December, 2022 [hereinafter “detention
lists”]. Aggrieved by the same, Petitioner has invoked Article 226 of the
Constitution of India, 1950 seeking mandamus to Respondents to direct
deletion of his name from the detention lists and grant permission to appear
Digitally Signed        W.P.(C) 1/2023                                                         Page 1 of 7
in the V-semester examinations commencing from 03rd January, 2023 to 14th
5.      Petitioner’s case is that he fractured his hand on 04th November, 2022,
in an accident while playing football. He was advised complete bed rest
from 16th November, 2022 to 16th December, 2022 and as result he could not
meet the minimum attendance criteria for appearing in the V-semester
examinations. The above facts were brought to the notice of the concerned
authorities of the University with supporting medical documents on 19th
December, 2022, however, the same were disregarded and his name was
included in the detention lists. The fallout is that for reasons beyond his
control, due to an unexpected injury, Petitioner has been barred from
appearing in the upcoming V-semester examinations.
6.      Mr. M.K. Gahlaut, counsel for Petitioner submits that no reasons have
been provided for the detention and the lists are entirely non-speaking on
this aspect. Petitioner has genuine reasons to explain the shortage, which
have been overlooked. He was advised complete bed rest from 16th
November, 2022 to 16th December, 2022, and as a consequence, he was
unable to attend the classes during the said period to meet the minimum
attendance criteria. To buttress this contention, he places reliance on a
medical certificate dated 30th December, 2022 issued by one – Dr. Gautam
Dhir on the letterhead of BLK-MAX Super Speciality Hospital as well as
other medical documents. He also relies upon judgments of this Court in
Digitally Signed        W.P.(C) 1/2023                                                     Page 2 of 7
Adarsh Raj Singh v. Bar Council of India and Ors. and connected matters,1
and Aanya Kameshwar and Ors. v. Guru Gobind Singh Indraprastha
University and Ors.2 Furthermore, Mr. Gahlaut contends that Respondents
have not conducted minimum number of classes, as required by Bar Council
of India, and therefore, it is the University that is at fault for the shortage of
attendance and there is no good ground to detain the Petitioner from
appearing in the forthcoming examinations. The decision in Aanya
Kameshwar (supra) is relied on to argue that reasons for detention should
have been communicated to Petitioner as well as his parents to enable them
to make a proper representation and correct discrepancies, if any, in the
attendance records.
7.      Per contra, Mr. Mohinder J.S. Rupal, counsel for Respondents argues
that Petitioner ought to have secured minimum 70% attendance, as per
extant rules and his attendance is only 46.94% and therefore, he has been
rightly detained. Reliance is placed upon decisions of the Division Bench of
this Court in Kiran Kumari and Ors. v. University of Delhi and Ors.,3 and
Guru Gobind Singh Indraprastha University v. Naincy Sagar and Anr.
and connected matter.4
8.      The Court has considered the aforenoted contentions. At the outset, it
is considered apposite to extract the medical certificate relied upon by Mr.
Gahlaut to contend that Petitioner was advised complete bed rest from 16 th

November, 2022 to 16th December, 2022: -
9.      The above document has been issued on 30th December, 2022 for the
period from 16th November, 2022 to 16th December, 2022. However,
whether there was indeed such medical advice given is not discernible from
the medical prescriptions of the same doctor (Dr. Dhir) dated 15th
November, 2022 and 07th December, 2022. Mr. Gahlaut is also unable to
point out any document advising “bed rest” except for the above ex-post
facto certificate. Be that as it may, Mr. Rupal, on instructions, has informed
Digitally Signed        W.P.(C) 1/2023                                                    Page 4 of 7
the Court that Petitioner’s attendance is only 46.94%, as against minimum
requirement of 70%. Mr. Rupal has also confirmed that even if Petitioner is
given benefit of the aforenoted period (i.e., 16th November, 2022 to 16th
December, 2022), on account of medical exigency, he would get benefit of
40 lectures and his attendance would consequently rise up to 59%, which
would still be falling short of minimum requirement of 70%. In this regard,
Mr. Rupal has shared following data regarding Petitioner’s attendance. The
same is culled out below: -
Drafting Pleading and October           4 out of 10
Conveyance             November         5 out of 11
Business Regulations October            9 out of 13
November         11 out of 12
10.     Petitioner has therefore, attended only 123 out of 262 lectures. The
medical ground urged by Petitioner is thus of no avail. The judgments relied
upon by the Petitioner are also not applicable to facts of the present case.
Digitally Signed        W.P.(C) 1/2023                                                    Page 5 of 7
The student is expected to attend all classes. However, as held in Naincy
Sagar (supra), the minimum attendance requirement of 70% gives a student
some leeway to skip or abstain from attending 30% of the lectures for
variety of reasons ranging from sickness, a tragedy in the family, unforeseen
circumstances or other reasons beyond the control of the student. The
attendance of Petitioner is only 46.94%, which is well below the 70%
minimum attendance requirement, a pre-requisite for appearing in the
examinations. In the instant case, even if one were to exclude the period
from 16th November, 2022 to 16th December, 2022, the period when the
Petitioner was allegedly unable to attend classes on account of a fracture of
his hand, his attendance would still fall short of the 70% minimum
attendance requirement. The father of the Petitioner, who is present during
the hearing, has expressed his dismay and urges the Court to take a lenient
view considering the fact that the decision of the University would prolong
Petitioner’s course and result in wastage of six precious months. The Court,
however, remains unconvinced as the Petitioner has attended classes
sporadically throughout the semester, and the minimum attendance criteria
is a requirement which cannot be glossed over. As held in Naincy Sagar
(supra) attendance of a minimum percentage of classes prescribed in
professional courses such as LL.B. is non-negotiable. Importance of
attending lectures for imbibing the syllabus/curriculum in a given semester,
the most efficient way of learning, must be underscored. Further, Mr.
Gaulaut has submitted that minimum number of classes, as required by Bar
Council of India, have not been held by the University. This remains a lone
submission sans any reference in the plaint and unsubstantiated by any
document shown to the Court. University shall deal with the same in the

11.     For the foregoing reasons, the Court is not inclined to grant any
interim order and accordingly the application is dismissed.
12.     Issue notice. Mr. Rupal, counsel for the Respondent No. 1 accepts
notice. Issue notice to remaining Respondents, upon filing of process, by all
permissible modes, returnable on the next date of hearing.
13.     Let counter affidavit be filed within four weeks from today.
Rejoinder, if any, be filed within two weeks thereafter.
