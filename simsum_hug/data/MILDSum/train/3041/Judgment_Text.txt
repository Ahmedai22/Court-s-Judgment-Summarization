Heard the learned counsel on either side.
2. The petitioner after completing his 10th standard, joined Diploma in
Mechanical Engineering and thereafter, he obtained B.E Degree Course through
lateral entry. Now he wants to study law. Since he has not done 12th standard,
he had difficulties in taking up the Law Degree Course. That led to filing of
this writ petition.

Counsel appearing for the Bar Council of India drew my attention to the
decision taken by the Legal Education Committee on 21.05.2022. The said
decision reads as follows:
