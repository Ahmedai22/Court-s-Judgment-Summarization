While hearing a Degree Graduate's plea seeking to allow him to study law in the absence of a 12th Standard Degree, the Bar Council of India informed Justice GR Swaminathan that as per the decision taken by its Legal Education Committee on 21st May 2022, diploma courses and polytechnic courses will be treated at par with a 12th standard certificate.
After consideration, it is resolved that the 3 year diploma/polytechnic course issued by an institution recognized by the Government shall be considered at par with +2 certificate for the purpose of equivalence for admission to the 5 year integrated L.L.B. Degree Course.
The petitioner, after completing the 10th standard joined Diploma in Mechanical Engineering. Thereafter, he obtained a BE Degree through lateral entry. He then wanted to pursue 3 years LLB. However, since he had not completed 12th standard, he had difficulties in securing admission.
Since the position was clarified by the Bar Council of India, the court said that the petitioner is eligible to apply for the three years course. Thus, it directed the Registrar of the Tamil Nadu Dr. Ambedkar Law University to consider the case of the petitioner and pass appropriate orders.
