2.      Since common point for consideration is involved in these
two writ petitions, both are clubbed together, heard and
disposed off by this common Order.
3.      The case of the petitioners is that, the petitioner No.1
College in W.P.No.12902/2022 is one of the oldest educational
institution which was initially started by Nehru Smaraka Vidya
Kendra and later taken over by Dr.Kurunji Venkataramana
Gowda, popularly known as KVG, who was a Gandhian in his
spirit    and   action.      The     petitioner   No.1-college     in
W.P.No.12946/2022 is also an oldest educational Institution in
Sullia     Taluk,    established     by     aforesaid     Dr.Kurunji
Venkataramana Gowda, and he was responsible for making
Sullia Taluk as Vidya Kashi.      The petitioner No.1-institutions
obtained the requisite permission from the Government and
affiliation from the respondents viz., The Dental Council of
WP No. 12902 of 2022
India-respondent No.4, Rajiv Gandhi University of Health
Test   (NEET)   is  the  qualifying  test  for   MBBS    and   BDS
programmes and it is conducted by the National Testing Agency
(NTA).       The procedure for admission to MBBS and BDS
courses, is as follows:
"(a) After    the  pre-university   examinations,    the
students intending to take up MBBS & BDS courses,
have to appear for the NEET.
(b)   The students who qualify in the NEET with the
required ranking, will have to apply to the Karnataka
Examination Authority (KEA) respondent No.3 and
have to register themselves and the said registration
of the students are done online.
(c)   There will be three rounds of counselling for
Admission to MBBS courses which includes the third
and final MOP-UP counselling.
(d)   There will be a gap of about 10 days to fill up
any stray vacancies for MBBS courses.
(e)   Thereafter, the next round of counselling will
be for the students who wish to choose BDS courses
and   there   will be  three  rounds     of counselling
including the stray vacancy round.
WP No. 12902 of 2022
(f)    The   students  who      intend  to  choose   BDS
courses have to follow the schedule notified by the
Medical Counselling Committee (MCC), which is a
wing of respondent No.5 and the said Committee is
established pursuant to the directions issued by the
Hon'ble Apex Court and the said Committee is
responsible to conduct online counselling."
4.     It is further case of the petitioners that for the academic
year 2021-22, petitioner Nos.2 and 3 in W.P.No.12902/2022
and petitioner Nos.2 to 5 in W.P.No.12946/2022 (hereinafter
called as petitioner-students) appeared for the NEET and were
qualified in the said test. In terms of the schedule announced
by the Medical Counselling Committee, vide Annexure-D, the
schedule for MCC Mop-up round 2 counselling for BDS 2021
Fresh Registration/payment             2nd May to 3rd May 2022
Choice filing and locking              2nd May to 3rd May 2022
Seat allotment processing              4th May 2022
Reporting at allotted college          6th May to 9th May 2022
WP No. 12902 of 2022
Seat allotment processing           10th May 2022
Reporting at allotted college       12th May to 15th May 2022
5.    It is further contended that, as could be seen from the
aforesaid schedule, the students who get qualified in the NEET,
have to register with the Karnataka Examination Authority-
respondent No.3, between 2nd May and 3rd May for Mop-up
round 2 counselling      for BDS 2021.         Unfortunately, the
website/portal    of  the   Karnataka     Examination    Authority-
respondent No.3 which facilitates the registration was not at all
open due to the reasons best known to respondent No.3 and
therefore, petitioner-students could not register themselves in
terms of the schedule announced by the Medical Counselling
Committee for Mop-up round 2 counselling for BDS 2021. As
per the note issued by the Karnataka Examination Authority,
the last date for admission to BDS i.e., Dental Courses for the
academic year 2021-22 was 15.05.2022 and in view of the non
availability of the website/portal of the Karnataka Examination
WP No. 12902 of 2022
Authority-respondent No.3 for registration, petitioner-students
were deprived of getting admission to BDS course for the
academic year 2021-22.       It is further case of the petitioners
that the permitted intake of students to petitioner No.1-college
in W.P.No.12902/2022 was 40 and only 34 students were
admitted and 6 seats are still vacant. In W.P.No.12946/2022,
the petitioner No.1-institution has permitted intake of 100
students and only 96 students have been admitted and 4 seats
are still vacant.     Therefore, the petitioner No.1-institutions
addressed     a   letter  to   the     respondent  No.3-Karnataka
Examination Authority, on 12.05.2022, as per Annexure-G
requesting the authority to permit the petitioner-students to
register in the Karnataka Examination Authority website to
facilitate their admission. However, since the respondent No.3
did not make their website/ portal available for the petitioner-
students to register on 2nd and 3rd of May for Mop-up round 2
counselling for BDS 2021, they could not register and get the
admission to the Dental course. Therefore, the petitioner No.1-
institutions and the petitioner-students are before this Court for
the relief sought for.
6.     The respondent No.1-State Government and respondent
No.2-The Directorate of Medical Education, are represented by
Sri Laxminarayan, learned Additional Government Advocate.
The Dental Council of India-respondent No.4 is represented by
Sri Aditya Bhat, learned counsel for Sri G.S.Bhat, learned
counsel.      The Directorate    General   of  Health  Sciences-
respondent No.5 is represented by Sri V.C.Sudeep, Central
Council-respondent No.6 is represented by Smt.Sumana Baliga,
learned counsel and The Rajiv Gandhi University of Health
Sciences-respondent No.7 is represented by Sri Ashok N.Nayak,
learned counsel.    The aforesaid respondents have not filed
statement of objections. The Karnataka Examination Authority-
respondent No.3 represented by Sri N.K.Ramesh, has filed the
statement of objections.
7.     In the common statement of objections filed in both the
writ petitions, the respondent No.3-Karnataka Examination
Authority has contended that, these mischievous writ petitions
WP No. 12902 of 2022
at the behest of petitioners No.1-colleges to circumvent
admission procedure which was concluded in May 2022 itself.
The petitioners No.1-colleges in the writ petitions have no locus
standi to seek prayer (i) as the registration process of the
students has nothing to do with the individual college. In the
scheme of the admission process, it is the students who have
to get themselves registered with the Karnataka Examination
Authority to participate in the counselling and the admission
process.     The petitioners have either not understood the
process of admission or have deliberately distorting the facts to
suit their convenience. The reference to Annexure-D, the time
schedule for admission to Mop up round by MCC for All India
quota seats has nothing to do with the time schedule fixed by
respondent No.3 for admission to State quota seats.       For the
Academic Year 2021-22, respondent No.3 had opened the
online registration process for eligible NEET qualified students
from 13.12.2021 till 17.12.2021 which was extended till
22.12.2021 again extended till 27.12.2021 and yet again
extended till 05.01.2022.     During the said period, 15,534
students    got  registered with     the Karnataka   Examination
WP No. 12902 of 2022
Authority. Again, just before the commencement of the Mop up
round, the registration was opened from 29.03.2022 to
31.03.2022    which   was   again extended      till  2.00  pm    on
01.04.2022 to enable the students to appear for Mop up round
and also to include their names in the list of students who could
get themselves admitted by the colleges in the stray vacancy
round. During the said period, 1,513 students got themselves
registered with the Karnataka Examination Authority.            It is
further contended that except Miss.O.Shifina-petitioner No.3 in
W.P.No.12946/2022 none of the other petitioner-students
availed the said opportunity to register themselves with the
Karnataka Examination Authority. However, aforesaid Shifina
also did not avail the opportunity of getting admitted to the
college within the last date prescribed for admission and thus
cannot be admitted at this juncture.       The list of registered
students who did not secure any seats in the counselling
process was forwarded to the colleges on 09.04.2022. The last
date prescribed for admission to the colleges was 09.04.2022
which was extended by MCC till 15.05.2022.           The petitioner-
students did not register themselves with the Karnataka
WP No. 12902 of 2022
Examination Authority at any point of time nor participated in
the admission process.      As per the procedure laid down, the
colleges could give admission to only those students whose
names were found in the list forwarded by the Karnataka
Examination Authority. As the names of the petitioner-students
(except aforementioned Shifina) were not included in the list
forwarded to the colleges, they are not entitled to be admitted
to the course.     The petitioners No.1-colleges being aware of
this procedure did not give admission within the last date
prescribed.     As an afterthought, at the behest of petitioners
No.1-colleges, the petitioner-students joined hands to get
illegal admission by filing the present writ petitions.
8.     It is further contended that, it is well settled principle of
law laid down by the Hon'ble Supreme Court that no admission
could be made to professional courses after the last date fixed
for admission.      In the present cases, the petitioners have
approached this Court on 27.06.2022, long after the last date
prescribed for admission, that too, to reopen the registration
process which cannot be countenanced.         Therefore, sought to
dismiss the writ petitions.
9.     We have heard the learned counsel for the parties to the
10.    Sri  Krishna  T,   learned     counsel   for   the   petitioners
contended with vehemence that, the date fixed by the Medical
Counselling Committee for registration and payment was 02nd
and    03rd   March 2022.      The      website   of   the   Karnataka
Examination     Authority   never      opened    and     thereby,   the
petitioner-students could not register or pay the fee and
thereby, meritorious students have been deprived of their
chance to study the professional course.                 It is further
contended that, the Note dated 07.05.2022 issued by the
Karnataka Examination Authority, vide Annexure-E, depicts
that, as per the letters dated 28.04.2022 and 05.05.2022
written    by  the  Ministry   of   Health    and    Family   Welfare,
Government of India and the Directorate of Medical Education,
Government of Karnataka, respectively, 15.05.2022 is the last
date fixed for admissions to Dental Courses for the year 2021.
Accordingly, the Names List Portal was enabled in Karnataka
Examination Authority website. In pursuance to the said Note
WP No. 12902 of 2022
and the schedule for MCC Mop-up round 2 counselling for BDS
2021,    the  Principal,  Sri  Venkateshwara     Dental    College-
petitioner No.1 in W.P.No.12902/2022 addressed a letter dated
12.05.2022 to the Executive Director, Karnataka Examination
Authority, as per Annexure-G, stating that, the registration and
verification of documents in respect of some of the students
who are qualified in NEET 2021 has not been done and such
students approached their college for admission to BDS course
for the Academic Year 2021-22, and therefore, requested to
allow the said students to register with Karnataka Examination
Authority and get the documents verified, so that they can
make admission to the college for the academic year 2021-22,
as the seats were still vacant, and if their request is considered
immediately, it would be helpful to both the management as
well as the students.
11.    It is contended that inspite of the said letter dated
12.05.2022, the Karnataka Examination Authority has not
permitted the students to get registered.          The admission
statement      of    the      petitioner    No.1     College      in
W.P.No.12902/2022, for the academic year 2021 depicts that,
WP No. 12902 of 2022
the total intake is 40 students and admissions done during the
year 2021 is 34 and 6 seats are vacant.         Similarly, the total
intake of students in respect of petitioner No.1 College in
W.P.No.12946/2022 for the academic year 2021-22 is 100, and
admissions done is 96 and 4 seats are vacant. Therefore, the
respondents have deprived the rights of petitioner-students to
prosecute their studies in BDS course and thereby the students
will lose one academic year.
12.    It is further contended that all the petitioner-students are
qualified in NEET and since the website/portal of the Karnataka
Examination      Authority  was    not   made    available  to    the
petitioner-students to facilitate their registration in terms of the
schedule issued by the MCC for mop-up round 2 counselling for
BDS 2021, petitioners could not get admission in the petitioners
No.1-colleges and thereby, for no fault of the petitioner-
students, their educational career will be jeopardized.
13.    It is further contended that the only reason for the
petitioner- students for missing the schedule issued by the MCC
is that the Karnataka Examination Authority did not open the
WP No. 12902 of 2022
website/portal facilitating the registration of students for mop-
up round 2 counselling for BDS 2021.          Thereby, petitioner-
students could not register themselves with the Karnataka
Examination Authority.       Thereby, if the petitioners No.1-
colleges are permitted to admit the petitioner-students, justice
will be done.     The College has acted like a parent to the
students and approached this Court and therefore, sought to
allow the writ petitions.
14.    Per contra, Sri N.K.Ramesh, learned counsel for the
respondent No.3-Karnataka Examination Authority, referring to
the common statement of objections filed in the above writ
petitions, contended that, the schedule for Mop-up round 2
counselling for BDS 2021 is issued by Medical Counselling
Committee for All India quota seats.       For the academic year
2021-22, the Karnataka Examination Authority had opened the
online registration process for eligible NEET qualified students
from 13.12.2021 till 17.12.2021 which was extended till
22.12.2021 again extended till 27.12.2021 and yet again
WP No. 12902 of 2022
extended till 05.01.2022.     During this period 15,534 students
got registered with the Karnataka Examination Authority. Just
prior to commencement of Mop up round, registration was open
from 29.03.2022 to 31.03.2022 which was again extended till
2.00 pm on 01.04.2022 enabling the students to appear for
Mop up round also, for inclusion of their names in the list of
students who could get themselves admitted by the colleges in
the stray vacancy round.           During the said period 1,513
students   got   themselves     registered      with  the   Karnataka
Examination Authority.     It is further contended that petitioner
No.3    in W.P.No.12946/2022          viz.,  Shifina.O,  availed    the
opportunity   to   register   with      the  Karnataka    Examination
Authority. But the said student did not avail the opportunity of
getting admitted to the college within the last date prescribed
for admission and therefore, now she cannot be permitted to
get admission in the college.           The last date prescribed for
admission to the colleges was 09.04.2022 and the same was
extended by Medical Counseling Committee till 15.05.2022.
The petitioner-students did not participate in the admission
process by registering themselves with Karnataka Examination
WP No. 12902 of 2022
Authority at any point of time. As per the procedure laid down,
the colleges could give admission to only those students whose
names were found in the list forwarded by the Karnataka
Examination Authority.      The colleges have no right to ask for
registration or to open the website and it is only the students
who are qualified in the NEET can ask for registration.
Therefore, Annexure-G letter dated 12.05.2022 written by the
petitioner No.1-college to the Karnataka Examination Authority
requesting to allow the students to register in Karnataka
Examination Authority, has to be ignored.          Both the writ
petitions are filed by the petitioner No.1-colleges along with
students, in the form of Public Interest Litigation in education
matter.     Filing litigation by the colleges on behalf of the
students is impermissible and therefore, sought to dismiss the
writ petitions with costs.
15.    In support of his contentions, learned counsel relied upon
the dictum of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Priya
Gupta v. State of Chhattisgarh, reported in AIR 2012 SC
16.    Sri Aditya Bhat, learned counsel for Sri G.S.Bhat, learned
counsel for respondent No.4 contended that the schedule for
MCC Mop up round 2 counselling for BDS 2021 vide Annexure-
D was issued by respondent No.5-Directorate General of Health
Services, Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, New Delhi and
not by the Karnataka Examination Authority. In both the writ
petitions, there are no pleadings by the students praying to
permit    them    to  register  on     the Karnataka   Examination
Authority website/portal and make payment.           It is not the
contention of any of the petitioner-students that on 02nd and
03rd May 2022, (the date fixed for Mop-up round) the website
was not open. It is only the Institution, which has no right in
this regard is alleging that the web site was not open. Thereby,
the writ petitions filed by the institutions are not maintainable.
The letter dated 12.05.2022 vide Annexure-G, is addressed by
the petitioners No.1-colleges to the Karnataka Examination
Authority and not by the petitioner-students, and therefore, it
is of no consequence.
17.     It is further contended that the cause title to the writ
petitions depicts that the petitioner-students are shown to be
C/o petitioner No.1-colleges, inspite of the fact that they are
not the students of the said colleges. The verifying affidavits
filed in support of the memorandum of writ petitions depicts
that the principal of the petitioner No.1-colleges has sworn to
the affidavit and it is stated that the other petitioners have
authorized him to swear to the affidavit. This clearly indicates
that the petitioners have not come to the Court with clean
hands and have suppressed the material facts.            How the
petitioner-students are given c/o address is not known.         He
further contended that the petitioner-students though got
qualified in NEET, since they did not register with Karnataka
Examination Authority within the time schedule, they are not
entitled to any relief before this Court and therefore, sought to
dismiss the writ petitions with costs.
18.     Sri Ashok N.Naik, learned counsel for respondent No.7 in
both the writ petitions, while supporting the arguments of Sri
WP No. 12902 of 2022
N.K.Ramesh,     learned   counsel      for  Karnataka     Examination
Authority, contended that the classes for the academic year
2021-22 have already commenced during May 2022 and those
students who get minimum 80% attendance will be eligible to
take up the examinations and therefore, question of granting
relief as prayed for, at this stage, would not arise, as the
petitioner-students    have   not      registered    with   Karnataka
Examination Authority within the time stipulated.           Therefore,
sought to dismiss the Writ Petitions.
19.    Sri  Laxminarayan,     learned       Additional    Government
Advocate contended that the writ petitions filed by the
petitioner No.1-Colleges on behalf of the students is not
maintainable, as absolutely there are no pleadings in the writ
petitions with regard to the petitioner-students approaching the
colleges seeking permission for registration with the Karnataka
Examination Authority. In the absence of the same, petitioners
No.1-colleges filing writ petitions along with the students is
nothing    but    harassing   the       authorities,   including    the
WP No. 12902 of 2022
Government and therefore, sought to dismiss the writ petitions
with costs.
20.   In view of the aforesaid rival contentions urged by the
learned counsel for the parties, the points that would arise for
our consideration are:
(i)    Whether the petitioner-students who have not
registered    with   the     Karnataka   Examination
Authority and the petitioners No.1-colleges are
entitled to the writ of mandamus to the Karnataka
Examination Authority directing to admit the
petitioner-students to the BDS course for the
(ii) Whether the petitioners have made out a case
to direct the respondent No.4-Dental Council of
India and respondent No.7-Rajiv Gandhi University
of Health Sciences to approve admissions of
petitioner-students to the BDS course for the
Academic Year 2021-22, in the facts and
circumstances of the present cases?
21.   We have given our thoughtful consideration to the
arguments advanced by the learned counsel for both the
parties and perused the entire material on record, carefully.
WP No. 12902 of 2022
22.    It is undisputed fact that petitioners No.1-institutions in
both the writ petitions are two different colleges/institutions
managed by a single Management and the petitioner-students
who are said to be the aspirants to BDS course have filed the
present writ petitions.
23.    It is well settled that any person who approaches the
Court for a writ of mandamus should first convince the Court as
to what is the statutorily enforceable right available to him. A
careful reading of the pleadings in the writ petitions make it
clear that the petitioners have not made out any statutorily
enforceable right to issue a writ in the nature of mandamus. In
the absence of the same, petitioners are not entitled to any
relief before this Court in exercise of powers under Articles 226
and 227 of the Constitution of India.     Our view is fortified by
the dictum of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Mani
Subrat Jain v. State of Haryana, reported in AIR 1977 SC
276, wherein, at paragraph-9 it is held as under:
"9. The High Court rightly dismissed the petitions.
It is elementary though it is to be restated that no
one can ask for a mandamus without a legal right.
WP No. 12902 of 2022
There must be a judicially enforceable right as well
as a legally protected right before one suffering a
legal grievance can ask for a mandamus. A person
can be said to be aggrieved only when a person is
denied a legal right by someone who has a legal
duty to do something or to abstain from doing
something. (See Halsbury's Laws of England, 4th
Edn., Vol. I, para 122; State of Haryana v. Subash
Desai v. Roshan Kumar Haji Bashir Ahmed [(1976)
1 SCC 671 : (1976) 3 SCR 58] and Ferris
: Extraordinary Legal Remedies, para 198.)"
24.   It is the specific case of the petitioners that, though
Annexure-D     was   issued  by     the Karnataka   Examination
Authority giving the schedule for MCC mop up round counseling
for BDS 2021 fixing the date for fresh registration/payment as
02nd and 03rd May 2022 however, the website was not open.
Thereby the students could not register themselves with the
Karnataka Examination Authority. Therefore, on behalf of the
students, the petitioners No.1/colleges made representation
dated 12.05.2022 to the Karnataka Examination Authority
WP No. 12902 of 2022
requesting to open the website and permit the students to
register with Karnataka Examination Authority.
25.   In   the   statement     of     objections,    the    Karnataka
Examination Authority has specifically contended that, for the
Academic Year 2021-22 the website/portal was open for online
registration process by the eligible NEET qualified students from
13.12.2021 till 17.12.2021 which was extended till 22.12.2021
again extended till 27.12.2021 and yet again extended till
05.01.2022.    During this period, 15,534 students registered
their names with the Karnataka Examination Authority. Again,
just before the commencement of the Mop up round, the
website/portal was opened from 29.03.2022 to 31.03.2022
which was again extended till 2 pm on 01.04.2022 to enable
the students to appear for Mop up round and also to include
their names in the list of students who could get themselves
admitted by the colleges in the stray vacancy round.           During
the said period, 1,513 students got themselves registered with
the Karnataka Examination Authority.         It is further contended
that except Shifina-petitioner No.3 in W.P.No.12946/2022 none
of the other petitioner-students availed the said opportunity to
WP No. 12902 of 2022
register themselves with the Karnataka Examination Authority.
The above student obviously did not avail the opportunity of
getting admitted to the college within the last date prescribed
for admission and thus she cannot get admitted at this
juncture.

following pages.                               30-12-2021 8.00 pm
27.   At this juncture, it is relevant to note that, in the
statement    of   objections,  the      respondent     No.3-Karnataka
Examination Authority has categorically denied the assertion of
the petitioners that date was fixed for fresh registration/
payment on 02nd and 03rd May 2022 as per Annexure-D, rather,
specifically stated that for the Academic Year 2021-22, the
online registration process for eligible NEET qualified students
was open from 13.12.2021 till 17.12.2021, the same was
extended till 22.12.2021 again extended till 27.12.2021 and yet
again extended till 05.01.2022.          During this period, 15,534
students    got  registered   with     the   Karnataka    Examination
Authority. Again, just before the commencement of the Mop up
round, the registration was opened from 29.03.2022 to
31.03.2022     which   was   again extended       till  2.00  pm   on
01.04.2022.     The said categorical statement made by the
WP No. 12902 of 2022
Executive Director of Karnataka Examination Authority on oath
is not denied by the petitioners by filing rejoinder.
28.    Thereby, the contention of the learned counsel for the
petitioners    that  the   date    was    fixed   by   the   Karnataka
Examination         Authority         vide       Annexure-D          for
registration/payment, is without any substance. It is also not
in dispute that the Executive Director, Karnataka Examination
Authority in the NOTE dated 07.05.2022 produced as per
Annexure-E, specifically stated that, as per the letter dated
28.04.2022      from   the   Ministry    of   Health    and   Welfare,
Government of India and letter dated 05.05.2022 from the
Directorate of Medical Education, Government of Karnataka,
15.05.2022 is the last date for admission to Dental courses for
the year 2021. It is further stated that, the Names List portal
is enabled in the Karnataka Examination Authority website.
29.    The petitioners have not denied the specific averments
made at paragraph-4 of the statement of objections specifying
the dates on which the online registration process was open for
the   eligible   candidates   to    register    with  the    Karnataka
WP No. 12902 of 2022
Examination Authority nor produced any contra documents to
the effect that the Karnataka State e-Information Bulletin
containing the calendar of events issued is not meant for
registration to BDS course for the year 2021.
30.    Though Sri Krishna T, learned counsel for petitioners
contended that even before the last date fixed by the Medical
Counselling Committee, the petitioner No.1-college by the letter
dated 12.05.2022 brought to the notice of the respondent
No.3-Karnataka Examination Authority regarding non opening
of website/portal and requested to open the website and permit
the students to register with Karnataka Examination Authority
stating that the same will help both the Management and the
students, it has to be noted that such permission cannot be
granted and it cannot be lost sight that the petitioners No.1-
colleges being the Management, are not the aggrieved parties
to address letter to the respondent No.3 praying to open the
website/portal.   It is only the students who can seek such
prayer, if they are so aggrieved.     Only the students who are
qualified in NEET can approach the respondent No.3.            The
representation made by the college has no consequence.
WP No. 12902 of 2022
31.    It is very interesting to note that entire pleadings is silent
about the grievance of the students and, the petitioners No.1-
colleges filed the verifying affidavit in support of the pleadings
in the writ petitions stating as under:
"I submit that I am the representing petitioner No.1
Institution and I know the facts of the case.      The
other petitioners have authorized me to swear to
this affidavit."
32.    In the cause title to W.P.No.12902/2022 the address of
the petitioner-students is shown as c/o Sri Venkateshwara
Dental College and Hospital, Kariyappanahalli, Anekal Road,
Bannerghatta, Bengaluru-560 083 and in W.P.No.12946/2022,
the address of the       petitioner-students is shown as C/o KVG
Dental College and Hospital, Kurunjibagh, Vidyanagar, Sullia-
574 327.      We are bowled over as to how the students come
under the 'care of' the college of which they are not the
students at all. This clearly indicates, only with an intention to
fill up the vacant seats, the petitioner No.1-colleges have
adopted the indirect method of getting an order from the Court
and therefore, have not approached the Court with clean
hands.     If the petitioner-students were really deprived of the
WP No. 12902 of 2022
seats to which they were eligible, they would have approached
the Court, independently, by producing the documents showing
the illegality, if any, committed by any of the respondents
herein. But that is not the case in the present writ petitions.
The colleges cannot step into the shoes of students and file the
writ petitions.
33.   A writ of mandamus sought by the petitioners No.1-
colleges on behalf of the students who are not admitted into
the college is not maintainable, as already held by us.      Filing
and contesting these types of litigation is nothing but wasting
precious public time and that of this Court and is nothing but
harassing the respondent-authorities unnecessarily, by driving
them to the Court and making them to spend litigation
expenses etc.,     Since the petitioners have not come to the
Court with clean hands, they are not entitled to any relief
before this Court in exercise of powers under Articles 226 and
227 of the Constitution of India.
34.   At this stage, it is relevant to refer to the dictum of the
Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Priya Gupta v. State of
WP No. 12902 of 2022
Chhattisgarh, reported in AIR 2012 SC 2413, wherein at
paragraph-30, it is held as under:
30.    Thus, the need of the hour is that binding dicta
be prescribed and statutory regulations be enforced,
so that all concerned are mandatorily required to
implement the time schedule in its true spirit and
substance. It is difficult and not even advisable to
keep some windows open to meet a particular
situation of exception, as it may pose impediments
to the smooth implementation of laws and defeat the
very object of the scheme. These schedules have
been prescribed upon serious consideration by all
concerned. They are to be applied stricto sensu and
cannot be moulded to suit the convenience of some
economic     or   other   interest    of   any   institution,
especially, in a manner that is bound to result in
compromise of the abovestated principles.           Keeping
in view the contemptuous conduct of the relevant
stakeholders, their cannonade on the rule of merit
compels      us    to   state,     with     precision    and
esemplastically, the action that is necessary to
ameliorate the process of selection. Thus, we issue
the   following directions      in  rem    for their    strict
compliance,     without   demur     and    default, by     all
WP No. 12902 of 2022
(i)     The commencement of new courses
or increases in seats of existing courses of
MBBS/BDS are to be approved/recognised
by the Government of India by 15th July of
each    calendar   year      for the  relevant
academic sessions of that year.
(ii)    The Medical Council of India shall,
immediately thereafter, issue appropriate
directions and ensure the implementation
and commencement of admission process
within one week thereafter.
(iii)    After 15th July of each year, neither
the Union of India nor the Medical or Dental
Council of India shall issue any recognition
or approval for the current academic year. If
any such approval is granted after 15th July
of any year, it shall only be operative for the
next academic year and not in the current
academic year. Once the sanction/approval
is granted on or before 15th July of the
relevant year, the name of that college and
all seats shall be included in both the first
and the second counselling, in accordance
with the Rules.
(iv) Any medical or dental college, or seats
thereof, to which the recognition/approval is
issued subsequent to 15th July of the
respective year shall not be included in the
counselling to be conducted by the authority
concerned and that college would have no
right to make admissions in the current
academic year against such seats.
(v)     The admission to the medical or
dental    colleges   shall   be   granted    only
through     the   respective    entrance    tests
conducted by the competitive authority in
the   State    or  the   body   of   the private
colleges. These two are the methods of
selection and grant of admission to these
courses. However, where there is a single
Board conducting the State examination and
there is a single medical college, then in
terms of Clause 5.1 of the Medical Council of
the admission can be given on the basis of
10+2 exam marks, strictly in order of merit.
(vi)     All admissions through any of the
stated   selection    processes    have   to   be
effected only after due publicity and in
WP No. 12902 of 2022
consonance with the directions issued by
this Court. We vehemently deprecate the
practice    of  giving     admissions      on    30th
September of the academic year. In fact,
that is the date by which, in exceptional
circumstances, a candidate duly selected as
per the prescribed selection process is to
join the academic course of MBBS/BDS.
Under the directions of this Court, second
counselling should be the final counselling,
as this Court has already held in Neelu
Arora v. Union of India [(2003) 3 SCC 366]
and third counselling is not contemplated or
permitted     under    the     entire   process     of
selection/grant     of     admission      to    these
professional courses.
(vii)    If any seats remain vacant or are
surrendered     from      all-India    quota,    they
should positively be allotted and admission
granted strictly as per the merit by 15th
September of the relevant year and not by
holding     an   extended       counselling.      The
remaining time will be limited to the filling
up    of  the  vacant      seats    resulting    from
exceptional circumstances or surrender of
seats.    All  candidates       should     join    the
WP No. 12902 of 2022
academic courses by 30th September of the
academic year.
(viii)   No college may grant admissions
without    duly  advertising     the  vacancies
available   and   by    publicising  the   same
through the internet, newspaper, on the
notice board of the respective feeder schools
and colleges, etc. Every effort has to be
made by all concerned to ensure that the
admissions are given on merit and after due
publicity and not in a manner which is ex
facie arbitrary and casts the shadow of
(ix)     The admissions to all government
colleges have to be on merit obtained in the
entrance    examination     conducted    by   the
nominated authority, while in the case of
private colleges, the colleges should choose
their option by 30th April of the relevant
year, as to whether they wish to grant
admission on the basis of the merit obtained
in the test conducted by the nominated
State authority or they wish to follow the
merit list/rank obtained by the candidates in
the    competitive   examination     collectively
held by the nominated agency for the
WP No. 12902 of 2022
private colleges. The option exercised by
30th April shall not be subject to change.
This choice should also be given by the
colleges which are anticipating grant of
recognition, in compliance with the date
specified in these directions.
35.   The Hon'ble Supreme Court, in the case of Dar-Us-Slam
Educational Trust and others vs. Medical Council of India and
others passed in WP No.267/2017 dated 09.05.2017, wherein,
at paragraph-7, it is held as under:
7. In order to ascertain the number of seats that still
remain    vacant    after the     counselling  the   State
Government or the authority designated by the State
Government shall conduct manual counselling for
allotment    of    students.     After  the    completion
counseling, the State Government shall determine
the number of seats that are still vacant and
thereafter shall forward a list of students in order of
merit, equaling to ten times the number of vacant
seats to the medical college so that in case of any
stray vacancy arising in any college the said seat
may be filled up from the said list.
WP No. 12902 of 2022
36. The Hon'ble Supreme Court, in the case of Education
Promotion Society for India v. Union of India, reported in
(2019)7 SCC 38, at paragraphs 6 and 7, held as under:
"6. In this case the petitioners want a general
extension of time not on account of any particular
difficulty faced by any individual college or university
but generally on the ground that a large number of
seats for the PG courses are lying vacant. It is stated
that more than 1000 seats are lying vacant. In the
affidavit filed by the UoI it is mentioned that as far as
deemed universities are concerned there are 603
seats lying vacant. However, it is important to note
that out of 603 seats lying vacant only 31 are in
clinical subjects and the vast majority (572) that is
almost 95% of the seats are lying vacant in non-
clinical subjects. There is no material on record to
show as to what is the situation with regard to the
remaining 400-500 seats. This Court however can
take judicial notice of the fact that every year large
number of non-clinical seats remain vacant because
many graduate doctors do not want to do post
graduation in non-clinical subjects. Merely because
the seats are lying vacant, in our view, is not a
ground to grant extension of time and grant further
opportunity to fill up vacant seats. The schedule
WP No. 12902 of 2022
must be followed. If we permit violation of schedule
and grant extension, we shall be opening a pandora's
box and the whole purpose of fixing a time schedule
and laying down a regime which strictly adheres to
time schedule will be defeated.
7.     We may note that in the schedule prescribed,
there are three rounds of counselling, the first round,
the second round and the mop-up round. The mop-
up round was to be completed by 31-5-2019 and if
some seats remain vacant even after the mop-up
round it cannot be helped. Extension cannot be
granted just because some seats are lying vacant
without there being any other justification."
37.    The contention of Sri Krishna, learned counsel for the
petitioners that Sri Venkateshwara Dental College and Hospital
i.e., petitioner No.1 in W.P.No.12902/2022, the total intake for
the academic year 2021 is 40 and the admissions done is 34
and still 6 seats are vacant and that KVG Dental College and
Hospital-petitioner No.1 in W.P.No.12946/2022, the total intake
for the academic year 2021 is 100 and the admission done is
96 and still 4 seats are vacant, is of no consequence. That is
how the colleges have approached the Court to get an order to
fill up the vacant post and thus, the exercise of the Colleges is
WP No. 12902 of 2022
for its personal benefit and not for the benefit of the students.
Thereby, the petitioners have not made out any case to grant
the relief sought for in the present writ petitions.
38.    The Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of S. Krishna
Sradha v. State of A.P., reported in (2020) 17 SCC 465,
rendered by three Judges, at paragraph 9(ii) held as under:
"9(ii) Under exceptional circumstances, if the court
finds that there is no fault attributable to the
candidate and the candidate has pursued his/her
legal right expeditiously without any delay and
there is fault only on the part of the authorities
and/or there is apparent breach of rules and
regulations as well as related principles in the
process of grant of admission which would violate
the right of equality and equal treatment to the
competing candidates and if the time schedule
prescribed — 30th September, is over, to do the
complete   justice,  the   Court  under    exceptional
circumstances and in rarest of rare cases direct the
admission in the same year by directing to increase
the seats, however, it should not be more than one
or two seats and such admissions can be ordered
within reasonable time i.e. within one month from
30th September i.e. cut-off date and under no
WP No. 12902 of 2022
circumstances, the Court shall order any admission
in the same year beyond 30th October. However, it
is observed that such relief can be granted only in
exceptional circumstances and in the rarest of rare
cases. In case of such an eventuality, the Court
may also pass an order cancelling the admission
given to a candidate who is at the bottom of the
merit list of the category who, if the admission
would have been given to a more meritorious
candidate who has been denied admission illegally,
would not have got the admission, if the Court
deems it fit and proper, however, after giving an
opportunity   of   hearing      to a student    whose
admission is sought to be cancelled."
39.    For the reasons stated above, the first point raised for
consideration is answered in the negative holding that the
petitioners have not made out any ground to direct the
Karnataka Examination Authority to admit the petitioner-
students to petitioners No.1-college to the BDS course for the
Academic Year 2021-22.        Accordingly, the 2nd point is also
answered in the negative holding that the petitioners have not
made out a case to direct the respondent No.4-Dental Council
WP No. 12902 of 2022
of India and respondent No.7-Rajiv Gandhi University of Health
Sciences to approve admissions of petitioner-students to the
BDS course for the Academic Year 2021-22.
40.    It is relevant to state at this stage that, because of
petitioners No.1-college the petitioner-students approached the
Court believing that they get the relief before this Court and
they will get admission in the college.     Thereby, the precious
time of the petitioner-students has been wasted. So also, the
petitioners have wasted the Court time for more than half a
day, depriving the other genuine litigants.     The experience of
this Court is that in recent years there has emerged a trend of
filing speculative litigations before various Courts of law, not
just in the Court of first instance, but also in the High Court as
well as before the Hon'ble Supreme Court.      It is the duty of the
Courts to ensure that such litigations shall be weeded out at
the first instance rather than allowing to be festered and
thereby coming in the way of genuine litigants seeking justice
treating the Court as "Temple of Justice" and to protect
precious public & judicial time of the court.        Therefore, the
WP No. 12902 of 2022
petitioners No.1-colleges are liable to pay cost for wasting
precious Court time.
41.    In view of the above, we pass the following:
(i)   The Writ petitions are hereby dismissed as
devoid of merits with costs of `2,00,000/- (Rupees
two lakhs), i.e., `1,00,000/- (Rupees one lakh)
payable by Sri Venkateshwara Dental College and
Hospital-petitioner No.1 in W.P.No.12902/2022 and
`1,00,000/- (Rupees one lakh) payable by KVG
Dental   College    &  Hospital-petitioner  No.1    in
(ii)  The costs of `2,00,000/- (Rupees two lakhs)
(as stated supra) shall be deposited with the
Advocates' Association, Bengaluru, within a period
of one month from the date of receipt of certified
copy of this Order, failing which the Registry is
directed to post the matter before the Court for
WP No. 12902 of 2022
implementation     of  the    order  with  regard    to
payment of costs.
(iii) Registry is directed to communicate a copy of
this Order to the Secretary, Advocates' Association,
Bengaluru, for information.
