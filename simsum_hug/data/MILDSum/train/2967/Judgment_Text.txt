Aggrieved by the order of transfer, the petitioner
H   has filed the instant petition for grant of the following
substantive relief:-
“Issue a writ of certiorari for quashing the transfer
order      dated 16.08.2022(Annexure P-1) issued by
respondent No.2.”
2.         A perusal of the records goes to show that the
transfer of the petitioner has been effected on the basis of
the D.O. Note issued by the Member of Parliament. A
perusal of the D.O. Note further goes to show that not only
the petitioner has been recommended to be transferred, but
even the station(s) to which he could be transferred
suggested in the D.O. Note. This amounts to encroachment
of the jurisdiction   and authority     of the Administrative
Authority and, therefore, clearly is not sustainable as the
question as to who and where is to be posted is the sole
discretion of the Administrative Authority.
3.    C    Consequently, the impugned           order of transfer
cannot sustain and is accordingly quashed and set aside.
4.         However, at this stage, learned counsel for
respondent No.3 states that it is due to extreme hardship
H   that he had approached the Member of Parliament for his
transfer. The father of respondent No.3 died on 09.06.2020
and after his death, it is he, who is required to take care not
only of his mother, who is currently 71 years of age and
suffering from multiple ailments, but also his daughter, who
is 16 years of age and suffering from a rare disease i.e.
Leukocytosis and currently under treatment from Kidney
It is more than settled that as regards the case of
individual hardship, it is for the employer         to decide the
same and reference can conveniently be               made to the
judgment of the Hon’ble Supreme Court in Rajendra Roy
vs. Union Of India and anr. (1993) 1 SCC 148.
6.         In the given facts and circumstances of the case,
we deem it appropriate to dispose of            this petition by
directing respondent No.2 to consider the          reply filed
respondent No.3 before this Court as a representation on
his behalf and thereafter decide the same sympathetically
taking into consideration the adverse family circumstances
mentioned supra in which respondent No.3 is placed and
take a decision thereupon within a period of 10 days from
H   today and, if possible, order the transfer and posting of
respondent No.3 to anyone of the following stations:-
(3).   GMS Amb u/c GSSS Amb, Una.
Ordered accordingly.
7.         The petition is disposed of in the aforesaid terms,
so also the pending application, if any.
8.         However, before parting,
it is made clear that
this order is being passed in the peculiar facts and
circumstances of the instant case and shall not be treated
as a precedent in future.
For compliance, to come up on 27.09.2022.
