This appeal is directed against the judgment and order dated
23rd September, 2014 passed by the High Court of Delhi at New Delhi
in W.P. (C) No. 3066 of 2013.
The writ petition filed by the respondents was allowed by the
High Court holding that acquisition proceedings stand lapsed in
terms   of  Section   24(2)   of  the  Right   to  Fair  Compensation  and
Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement
Act, 2013 (for short “the Act”).
The order passed by the High Court is not sustainable in view
of the Constitution Bench judgment, Indore Development Authority
vs. Manohar Lal reported in 2020 (8) SCC 129.
However,   Mr.    Neeraj   Kumar   Jain,   learned   senior  counsel
appearing for the land owners submitted that the challenge in the
writ   petition   was   to  an   order  passed   by  the  appellant  on  a
representation under Section 48 of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894
in terms of the directions issued by the High Court. Mr. Jain
prayed that the matter be remanded back to the High Court for
decision on the prayer made in the writ petition.
We do not find any merit in the argument raised by Mr. Jain.
Once  the  High  Court  has  passed  an  order  of  lapsing  of  the
acquisition proceedings by virtue of Section 24(2) of the Act, the
land owners cannot revert back on the plea raised that they are
entitled to seek release of land in terms of Section 48 of the Land
Acquisition Act, 1894 since repealed. The liberty is reserved with
the State Government to withdraw from the acquisition of any land
of which possession has not been taken. Section 48 of the erstwhile
Land Acquisition Act does not confer any right with a landowner to
seek withdrawal from the acquisition from the State Government.
Consequently, the appeal is allowed, the order passed by the
High Court is set aside and the writ petition is dismissed.
Pending application(s), if any, shall stand(s) disposed of.
