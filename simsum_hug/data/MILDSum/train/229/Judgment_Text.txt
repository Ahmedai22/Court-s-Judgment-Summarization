2. Heard         Mr.    B.S.    Patel,       the    learned            senior
advocate         for    Mr.   Chirag        Patel,     the       learned
advocate appearing for the writ applicants.
3. Though served, none appears for the respondents.
4. The writ applicants herein were the members /
office bearer of Ankleshwar Nagrik Sahakari Bank
Limited.         Custodian      came      to   be    appointed             on
12/11/2004. Prior to appointment of custodian,
donation         had    been    given       to  Bank       for       which
liquidator submitted a report dated 07/06/2011
Annexure-B          (Page    Nos.31        to   41).      The        State
Registrar-the           respondent         issued       show         cause
notice on 26/07/2011 for initiation of inquiry
against         the   writ   applicants.        (Page      Nos.19          to
30). A reply came to be filed by the members
i.e. the writ applicants stating that the said
show cause notice was against the provisions of
Section 93 of the Act that five years from the
date of inquiry be considered, prior to that no
order under Section 93 of the Act can be passed.
The      inquiry      report     dated      07/06/2011         is      duly
produced at Annexure-B (Page Nos. 31 to 41).
5. It is the case of the writ applicants that all
the transactions were much prior to the year
2004. The respondent passed the order holding
that the provisions of Section 93 of the Act is
to     be      considered     for       holding     inquiry          under
Section 93 of the Act. The provisions of the
limitation       Act  are     to     be  considered          without
considering the provisions of Section 93 of the
6. It is the case of the writ applicants that any
transaction prior to the period of five years
from the inquiry report dated 07/06/2011 is not
maintainable, in view of the settled position of
7. At this stage, it is apposite to refer to the
law as laid down by this Court in Special Civil
Application        No.4402      of     2014,    the        relevant
paragraph Nos.11 to 14, which reads thus :-
"11.Therefore, it appears to the Court
that even without going into the grounds
for which the Tribunal allowed the appeal
of the respondents No.2 to 11, the order
passed under Section 93 of the Act against
the respondents No.2 to 11 could not stand
scrutiny of law as in the facts of the
case, the provisions of Section 93 of the
Act were not attracted.
12. The inquiry under Section 93 of the
Act against any person is permissible only
when such person has taken any part in
organization of the society and misapplied
or retained money or committed other
illegality within 5 years prior to the
date of audit, inquiry, inspection under
Sections 84, 86 and 87 of the Act
respectively or prior to the date of
winding up of the society.
13. There is no dispute about the fact
that the resolutions for investment were
passed in the meeting by the respondents
No.2 to 10 as Directors and acted upon by
the respondent no.11 as Manager in the
year 1996. As stated by the Tribunal, such
resolutions were then confirmed in the
meeting by the members. As stated in the
order at Annexure:C, the inquiry under
Section 86 of the Act was ordered on
07.09.2010. Such inquiry was obviously
after more than a period of 5 years from
the date of decision to invest the
amounts.
14. Section 93 of the Act reads as under:
"93 (1) Where in the course of or as a
result of an audit under section 84, or
an inquiry under Section 86 or an
inspection under section 87, or the
winding up of a society, the Registrar
is satisfied on the basis of the report
made by the auditor or the person
authorized to make inquiry under section
86, or the person authorized to inspect
the books under section 87, or the
Liquidator under section 110, that any
person who has taken any part in the
organization      or     management           of       the
society or any deceased, or past or
present officer of the society has,
within a period of five years prior to
be   date   of        such    audit,          inquiry,
inspection or order for winding up,
misapplied or retained, or become liable
or   accountable        for,    any       money           or
property of the society, or has been
guilty of misfeasance or breach of trust
in   relation       to     the     society,             the
Registrar or a person authorized by him
in that behalf may investigate the
conduct of such person or persons and
after framing charges against such
person or persons, and after giving a
reasonable opportunity to the person
concerned and in the case of a deceased
person to his requiring him to repay or
restore the money or property or any
part thereof, with interest at such rate
as    the    Registrar        or     the          person
authorized      under      this     section            may
determine, or to contribute such sum to
the assets of the society by way of
compensation          in    regard          to         the
misapplication, retention, misfeasance
or breach of trust, as he may determine.
(2)    The    Registrar       or      the         person
authorized under sub-section (1) in
making any order under this section, may
provide therein for the payment of the
costs    or      any     part     thereof             such
investigation, as he thinks just and he
may direct that such costs or any part
thereof shall be recovered from the
person against whom the order has been
issued.
(3)     This       section       shall            apply,
notwithstanding that the act is one for
which the person concerned may be
criminally responsible,"
8. The aforesaid decision came to be confirmed by
the      Hon'ble     Division       Bench  in   Letters          Patent
Appeal No.721 of 2014, relevant paragraph No.5
reads thus :-
"Learned Single Judge has dismissed the
writ petition of the Bank on sole ground
noted above. We also concur with said
view. This was however not the ground on
which the decision of the Co.Op.Tribunal
was based. Thus, the contentions of the
Bank on the merits of the report under
Section 93(1) have remained untested.
While therefore dismissing this Letters
Patent       Appeal,         we      clarify              that
observations of the Co.Op.Tribunal in the
order dated 30               January, 2014 on the
reasons for quashing the report also would
not survive. In other words, if the Bank
institutes any other proceedings to pursue
its remedy that may be available under the
law, the same shall be decided unmindful
of the observations of the Co.Op.Tribunal
or even that of the report dated 12.7.2013
under Section 93(1) of the Act."
9. Relying on the aforesaid ratio, admittedly, the
writ applicants ceased to be Chairman / Vice
Chairman or Managing Directors in the Board of
Directors at the relevant time. In view of the
fact       that     the   Bank      came    to   be     closed          and
liquidator came to be appointed on 12.11.2004.
All the transactions therefor would be for a
period before 2004. The show cause notice which
came to be issued by the respondent authority is
also           an    undisputedly           dated       26.07.2011.
Therefore, all the transaction alleged against
the writ applicants are beyond the period of
five years from the date of show cause notice
i.e.       26.07.2011      and      also    from    the       date        of
inquiry report i.e. dated 07.06.2011 This Court
is     inclined       to   exercise        its   extra        ordinary
jurisdiction            under        Article      226        of         the
Constitution of India. The impugned show cause
notice dated 26/07/2011 is accordingly quashed
and set aside.
10.        For the reason stated above, as back as on
12.11.2004,          the  writ      applicants     ceased          to     be
members          of   bank    five       years   prior         to       the
initiation of inquiry i.e. 07.06.2012 show cause
notice         dated  26.07.2011       as  contemplated            under
Section 93 of the Act and in accordance with the
ratio        as    laid  down       by   this    Court         in      the
decisions referred to above. In view of this
Court, the issuance of show cause notice itself
cannot be said to be maintainable. In view of
this       Court,     no  purpose       would    be      served          by
relegating the writ applicant to appear before
the respondent authority. The prayers as prayed
for by the writ applicants are required to be
allowed and the same are allowed. The impugned
show cause notice dated 26/07/2011 accordingly
is quashed and set aside. Rule is made absolute
accordingly.
