   puthoor i/b Mehta & Padamsey for the Petitioner.
   Mr. Yakshay Chheda i/b Mr. Yash Bhatia for Respondent No. 1.
                                CORAM :       SURENDRA P. TAVADE, J.
                                DATE       :  4th NOVEMBER, 2021.
   .           Heard learned Counsel for the Petitioner and Respondent.
   2.          On   perusal  of the    petition   it    appears       that    on      26th
   September,2018, the Petitioner fled regular Civil Suit No. 938 of 2018
   before the Civil Judge, Senior Division, Thane, against the
   Respondent including the erstwhile publisher (Penguin Random
   House). On 6th October, 2016, Respondent No. 3 gave undertaking to
   Civil Judge, Senior Division that he would give two weeks advance
   notice to the Petitioner, if they intend to use the title “The Incomplete
   Man” for the publication         of purported autobiography.          On 28 th
   February, 2019, this Court restrained Respondent No. 3 from
   publishing book till 13th March, 2019, in Miscellaneous Civil
   Application (St) No. 30706 of 2018. On 18 th March 2019 this Court
   extended the injunction order till 25th March 2019 and directed to
   appear before the Learned Civil Judge, Senior Division, Thane on 25 th
   March 2019, at 3:00 p.m.. The parties have appeared before the trial
   Court, as per the direction of this Court. On 17 th April 2019, the trial
   Court in Civil Suit No. 938 of 2018 restrained Respondent No. 3 and
   erstwhile publisher from publishing the book for a period of eight days.
   But interim application came to be rejected.        The said order was
   challenged by the Petitioner before the District Court by preferring
   Miscellaneous Civil Application No. 83 of 2019 before the District
   Judge. On 22nd April 2019, the District Court extended the interim
   order and restrained Respondent No. 3 and erstwhile publisher from
   publishing book till the pendency of the appeal fled by the Petitioner.
   3.          It appears that the Respondent No. 3 has published
   autobiography in spite of injunction order passed against him. The
   said book is ofered for sale through Amazon by digitally and by hard
   copy. The said action is required to be stop because the injunction
   order is running against the Respondents.
   4.          I am of the considered opinion that the further damage is
   required to be averted by issuing the injunction order as prayed for.
               Injunction is issued against the Respondents in terms of the
   prayer clauses “f” and “v” of the petition as follows:
   “f) Pass an Order restraining/ injuncting the Contemnors No. 2 – 3,
   their directors, employees, wholesalers, distributors, franchise,
   partners, ofcers, representatives, servants, employees, agents or
   any one acting through or under or by their consent, and any other
   known and unknown persons to cease and desist from inter alia
   advertising, displaying, writing, editing, printing, authoring, selling,
   ofering for sale, further distribution, selling, or otherwise make
   available directly or indirectly the purported autobiography namely
   “An Incomplete Life” with any statements relating to the Petitioner
   pending         the   pendency     of  the   Appeal     bearing     no.      M.C.A
   0000083/2019 fled by the Petitioner currently sub-judice before the
   v) Pending hearing and fnal disposal of the present petition, the
   Contemnors, their ofcers, employees or anyone acting through or
   under or by their consent, be restrained by an appropriate order from
   committing further violation of order dated 22.04.2019;”
   5.          Stand over to 25th November, 2021.
