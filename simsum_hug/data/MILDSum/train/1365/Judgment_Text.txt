4. It is alleged that the accused-applicant got the arm license issued by
the District Magistrate, Lucknow transferred to New Delhi without
giving any prior information regarding the same to the authorities at
Lucknow and did not inform the concerned Police Station, i.e.
Mahanagar Police Station, and for that reason, one firearm is shown to
be registered concurrently at two States at different arms license
having different UIDs. It is further alleged that the accused-applicant
deliberately concealed the said information form the authorities,
including the police station, with an intention to illegally buy and use
the firearms. Further allegation is that the accused-applicant has
purchased and got registered several weapons on the said license
illegally and in an unauthorized manner. As many as 4431 cartridges

keeping the metal jacketed cartridges for shooting purposes, is against
the law and against the standard prescribed by the International

01661 of .357 (9.067 mm) on 11.12.2018, which was not permissible
for a shooter.
6. For importing one Rifle and six Barrels, the accused-applicant did
not use the NRAI permit, but he imported the same in his personal
baggage after paying concessional import duty under the provisions of
7. Learned counsel for the accused-applicant submits that the accused-
applicant is targeted being son of Sri Mukhtar Ansari for political
reasons as the present dispensation is inimical to and hostile to the
family of the accused-applicant. Accused applicant has not committed
any offence, but he is being framed, and the State Government and the
police are making him criminal by implicating him in several false
and frivolous case.
8. Learned counsel for the accused-applicant has further submitted
that the accused-applicant was given a firearm license by the District
Magistrate, Lucknow for DBBL Gun on 21.9.2012. The said license
was valid upto 24.9.2015. The accused-applicant being a shooter,
shifted to New Delhi for better practice and training to enhance his
shooting skills as he was pursuing his career in sports (shooting).
Keeping the aforesaid in mind, the accused-applicant had applied for
transfer of his arm license from Lucknow to New Delhi and moved an
application before the Joint Commissioner of Police (Licensing Unit),
New Delhi. Based on the said application, the Licensing Authority,
New Delhi issued a letter dated 10.4.2015 to the District Magistrate,
Lucknow for verification of the firearm license issued by him to the
accused-applicant. The District Magistrate, Lucknow issued “No
Objection Certificate” for the said firearm license dated 4.8.2015.
9. Accused-applicant being a national level sports person (shooting) is
entitled to keep seven firearms as per the Government of India’s
Notification No. S.O. 1988 (E), dated 4.8.2014 issued by the Ministry
of Home Affairs, Government of India and two firearms as a normal
citizen of India as per sub-section(2) of Section 3 of the Arms Act.
10. The police personnel of Police Station Mahanagar put up a notice
dated 22.8.2019 on the door of the residence of the accused-applicant
at Lucknow. The accused-applicant gave a detailed reply to the said
notice vide letter dated 24.8.2019. Thereafter, Police Station
Mahanagar sent a letter to the Joint Commissioner of Police
(Licensing Unit), New Delhi on 26.8.2019 for the purpose of seeking
verification on certain points. In turn, the Licensing Authority, New
Delhi replied to the said letter of Police Station Mahanagar, Lucknow
vide letter dated 29.8.2019.
11. Learned counsel for the accused-applicant has further submitted
that though the FIR was registered only under Section 420 IPC and
Section 30 of Arms Act, but during investigation, offences under
Sections 467, 468 and 471 IPC have been added without there being
any iota of evidence for commission of such an offence by the
accused-applicant. During investigation, statements of Sri Rajeev
Bhatia, Secretary, National Rifle Association of India and Mr. Dhillon,
Punjab Rifle Association were recorded by the Investigating Officer,
who clearly mentioned that the accused-applicant was a renowned
shooter for several years and had been given permission from the
National Rifle Association of India to import arms. The Investigating
Officer had presumed that the accused-applicant would use the
aforesaid arms and ammunition for illegal activities, and he had
acquired these weapons them by illegal means. There is no basis for
such a presumption. On the basis of the presumption, a person cannot
be made accused of offences under Sections 420, 467, 468 and 471
12. Learned counsel for the accused-applicant has drawn the attention
of this Court to the order passed by a Division Bench of this Court on
19.10.2019 in Writ Petition No.28833 (MB) of 2019 filed by the
accused-applicant impugning the FIR. The learned Division Bench of
this Court observed that, prima facie, allegations against the accused-
applicant were not made out from the contents of the FIR and the
authorities were directed not to arrest the accused-applicant in Case
Crime No.0431 of 2019, registered under Sections 420, 467, 468 and
471 IPC and Section 30 Arms Act, Police Station Mahanagar, District
Lucknow. After the charge sheet was filed, the said writ petition
became infructuous, and vide order dated 24.1.2022, the said writ
petition got dismissed as infructuous by a Division Bench this Court.
However, the accused-applicant was granted liberty, if he was
aggrieved by the charge sheet, he could take recourse to the remedy
under law as may be available to him.
13. The accused-applicant, thereafter, filed an application under
Section 482 Cr.P.C. bearing No.1905 of 2022. The said application is
still pending, and no interim order has been passed in the said
14. Learned counsel for the accused-applicant has further submitted
that the accused-applicant is a law-abiding citizen. He was not
arrested by the Investigating Officer during investigation, and it would
violate his fundamental rights guaranteed under Articles 14, 20 and 21
of the Constitution of India, if he is arrested in the aforesaid case. It is
further submitted that considering the aforesaid facts, the accused-
applicant be granted anticipatory bail in Crime No.431 of 2019, under
Section 420, 467, 468 and 471 IPC.
15. On the other hand, Sri Anurag Varma, learned AGA appearing
with Mr. V.K. Shahi, learned Additional Advocate General for the
State has opposed the anticipatory bail application and submitted that
the accused-applicant has as many as seven criminal cases, including
the present one, to his credit, which are as under:-
“1. Case Crime No.689 of 2020, under Sections 120-B, 420, 323, 356, 467,
468, 471, 474 and 477A IPC, Police Station Kotwali, Ghazipur;
2. Case Crime No.236 of 2020, under Sections 120-B, 420, 467, 468, 471,
474 IPC and Section 3 of Public Property (Prevention of Damage) Act,
3. Case Crime No.431 of 2019, under Sections 420, 467, 468 and 471 IPC
4. Case Crime No.27 of 2022, under Sections 188, 171A IPC and Section
133 of Representation of People Act, Police Station Dakshin Tola, Mau;
5. Case Crime No.95 of 2022, under Sections 188 and 171 IPC, Police
6. Case Crime No.97 of 2022, under Sections 171F, 506, 186, 189, 153A
and 120-B IPC, Police Station Kotwali, Mau; and
7. Case Crime No.106 of 2022, under Sections 171H, 188 and 341 IPC,
16. Learned AGA submits that accused applicant has said in the
application that he has no criminal antecedents. He has concealed the
true and correct facts from the Court. He got the license transferred
from Lucknow to New Delhi by giving false and incorrect facts. He
filed an affidavit on 14.10.2019 before the Licensing Authority, New
Delhi that he was residing at 111/A/9, Ganpati Niwas, Kishangarh,
Vasant Kunj, New Delhi-110070 since last three years. The affidavit
would read as if the said address was his permanent address. The
accused-applicant was not the resident of New Delhi, but he used to
visit New Delhi occasionally. He had taken the said house on rent
which consists of one room, bathroom and small terrace on 5 th Floor.
The landlady in her statement recorded under Section 161 Cr.P.C. has
said that the accused-applicant would visit the said address once in
two-three months. He was not staying in the said house. The theory
being propounded by the learned counsel for the accused-applicant
that he shifted his residence to New Delhi to avail better facilities for
his shooting practice gets belied completely by the statement of the
landlady of the house, address of which was given by the accused-
applicant to the Licensing Authority at New Delhi to get his license
transferred from Lucknow to New Delhi. By giving false affidavit he
got endorsed several weapons to his license, which are not used for
shooting practice purposes, but are deadly weapons. He also submits
that as many as 4431 cartridges were recovered from the possession of
the accused-applicant and these cartridges are not used for shooting
17. Learned AGA has further submitted that these facts once came to
the notice of the Licensing Authority i.e. Joint Commissioner of
Police (Licensing Unit), New Delhi, and the Licensing Authority
finding the serious nature of multiple violations of the terms and
conditions of Arms Act, 1959 and Arms Rules, 2016, had cancelled
the License No.SDVS/2/2015/1 issued to the accused-applicant vide
order dated 26.8.2021.
18. Learned AGA has also submitted that the accused-applicant did
not answer to summons, bailable warrants and then the learned
Magistrate had to issue non-bailable warrants against him. Learned
Magistrate has issued thrice non-bailable warrants on 15.7.2022,
27.7.2022 and 11.8.2022, but the accused-applicant could not be
arrested and, therefore, the proclamation has been issued under
Section 82 Cr.P.C. against him.
19. It has been further submitted that it is well settled law that an
absconder/fugitive of law is not entitled for anticipatory bail. The
accused-applicant has been avoiding the process of the Court.
20. Learned AGA has relied upon a judgement of the Supreme Court
rendered in the case of State of Madhya Pradesh Vs. Pradeep
Sharma, (2014) 2 SCC 171 to submit that a person against whom
proclamation has been issued and the proceedings under Section 82-
83 Cr.P.C. have been initiated, is not entitled to the benefit of
anticipatory bail.
21. In support of his submission, learned AGA has also relied upon
judgments rendered by the Supreme Court in the cases of Lavesh Vs.
State (NCT of Delhi), (2012) 8 SCC 730 and Prem Shankar Prasad
Vs. The State of Bihar and others, AIR 2021 SC 5125. He has also
relied upon a judgment of this Court passed in Bail No.8300 of
2019, Ankur Mishra Vs. State of U.P. and two others, decided on
22. I have considered the submissions advanced by the learned
counsel for the parties and perused the record.
23. From the facts as narrated above, it is evident that summons were
issued to the accused-applicant on 8.1.2021, 3.2.2021, 2.3.2021,
7.7.2021, 7.9.2021, 8.11.2021, 18.1.2022 by the learned Magistrate,
but he failed to appear before the court. Bailable warrants were issued
by the learned Magistrate on 4.4.2022, 21.5.2022, but the accused-
applicant again did not pay any heed to appear before the court
concerned. Thereafter, non-bailable warrants were issued against the
accused-applicant on 15.7.2022, 27.7.2022 and 11.8.2022, but the
accused-applicant did not surrender before the court, and the court
having no option, issued proclamation under Section 82 Cr.P.C. on
24. Considering the serious allegations that accused-applicant got
registered his arm license fraudulently and obtained prohibited
Barrels, weapons and cartridges in large numbers by taking ground of
shooting; and he has purchased weapons and cartridges, which are
prohibited in shooting practice and against the Notification dated
4.8.2014 of the Government of India, and also considering the fact
that accused-applicant has been avoiding the process of the Court,
against whom proclamation has been issued, this Court does not find
any ground to grant anticipatory bail to the accused-applicant.
25. Thus, the anticipatory bail application is rejected.
26. However, it is provided that if the accused-applicant surrenders
before the trial court and applies for regular bail, his bail application
should be considered expeditiously in accordance with law.
