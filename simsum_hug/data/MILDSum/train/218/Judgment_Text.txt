3.      On 30th March, 2022, by way of an interim order, pending final
adjudication of the petition, for academic year 2021-22, Petitioner college
was permitted to participate in counselling rounds of NEET UG 2021-22
and admit 50 more students (total 200) in MBBS course [hereinafter,
“interim order”]. It was however clarified that interim permission will

remain subject to outcome of the present petition and will not, in any
manner, preclude Respondents from initiating any action against Petitioners
in respect of purported deficiencies in Petitioner college, after following due
procedure, as per law.
4.      The afore-noted order was not assailed by either of the parties. In fact,
Respondents complied with the same and issued a letter of permission
[“LOP”] dated 05th April, 2022 approving increase of 50 seats to Petitioner
college. Thereafter, in respect of academic year 2022-23, Petitioner college
sent a request letter dated 21st April, 2022 to NMC for increase in seats from
150 to 250. On 24th-25th August, 2022, a surprise inspection was conducted
and a report was prepared, wherein for 200 seats, Petitioner college was
found compliant with existing norms in all aspects, except for a minor
deficiency in teaching staff [hereinafter, “inspection report”].1 Subsequent
thereto, Petitioner college submitted a representation dated 09th September,
2022 requesting NMC to consider increase up to 250 seats.
5.      Since no final decision was rendered on its representation, Petitioners
filed C.M. APPL. 44265/2022 seeking following reliefs:
“(a) Allow the present application and direct the Respondent No.2- National Medical
Commission to consider the Petitioner college for 250 medical students for the
Petitioner College for the academic year 2022-2023 and/or;
(b) Alternatively, direct the Respondents to expeditiously pass an order on the
representations dated 09.09.2022 sent by the Petitioners herein.”
6.      During the course of hearing on the above application, Mr. T.
Singhdev, counsel for Respondent No. 2, argued that Petitioner college’s
Annexure A-2 to C.M. APPL. 44265/2022.
Digitally Signed        W.P.(C) 5339/2022                                                                   Page 3 of 23
request could only be processed for 200 seats, as it had accepted the reduced
intake granted under interim order of the Court; and inspection was also
conducted keeping that in mind. This submission was strongly controverted
by Mr. Maninder Singh, Senior Counsel for Petitioners, who argued that
Petitioner college did not, at any stage, amend its original request of 250
seats and the same remained valid, irrespective of partial increase granted by
the Court as an interim measure. Mr. Maninder Singh also emphasised that
Petitioner college is fully equipped for increase up to 250 seats and it would
be a colossal waste of resources if permission for increased intake is not
granted to enable the Petitioner college to participate in the ongoing
counselling process. He argued that there is a deliberate attempt on
Respondents’ part to deny them this benefit; application for 250 seats was
not considered despite repeated follow-ups, and the timelines stipulated by
the Apex Court in Ashish Ranjan v. Union of India and Ors.2 have been
ignored. As time for admission was running out, on 13th October, 2022,
taking note of minor deficiency (0.49%) in teaching staff of Petitioner
college, as well as the policy of granting 5% relaxation to private medical
colleges,3 following directions were issued:
“11. Considering the afore-noted submissions, NMC is directed to:
(a) Confirm whether afore-noted shortage in teaching staff or any other
deficiency/aspect in the inspection report disentitles Petitioner-college from
increasing its intake to 250 seats for academic year 2022-23.
(b) File an affidavit explaining the criteria for relaxation of deficiencies up to 5% in
private medical colleges as noted in communication dated 07th July, 2017.”
7.       Pursuant to aforesaid directions, NMC filed an affidavit highlighting
the deficiencies that according to them, impede grant of 250 seats to

Petitioner college [hereinafter, “additional affidavit”]. Qua direction (b),
NMC acknowledged and confirmed that relaxation of up to 5% on faculty
strength is applicable to Petitioner college; however, as regards direction (a),
it is contended that if existing facilities available with Petitioner college as
per the MARB inspection report are to be considered for 250 seats, faculty
deficiency would substantially increase from 0.49% to 6.9%, which is
beyond the permissible limit of 5%.
8.      In the above background, considering the nature of relief sought in
aforesaid application, and uncertainty that would result if only interim
directions were issued, it was considered appropriate to hear and decide the
main petition as well, to which both the counsel straightway agreed.
9.      Mr. Singhdev’s submissions are as follows:
9.1.    For academic year 2022-23, there was no application for 250 seats on
behalf of Petitioner college. MARB has been accepting applications with
requisite fees in a particular format through its online portal and for
renewal of permission, Petitioner college ought to have submitted an
online application form on the designated portal containing specific
link(s) for this purpose. Reliance is placed upon its earlier online
application to contend that Petitioner college was aware of said
procedure.4
9.2.    Nevertheless, subsequent to grant of enhanced seats vide interim
order, inspection was conducted for 200 seats on 24th-25th August, 2022
Digitally Signed        W.P.(C) 5339/2022                                                    Page 5 of 23
to ensure that Petitioner college did, in fact, meet statutory requirements.
There are several aspects that disentitle increase in intake to 250. Having
failed to meet statutory requirements, Petitioner college cannot be granted
approval for 250 seats.
9.3.    Petitioner college had submitted an affidavit/ undertaking on 06th
October, 2022, accepting increase in seats to 200 for academic session
2022-23.5 Copy of an application-cum-undertaking/affidavit dated 30th
August, 2022 for 200 seats for academic year 2023-24 is also relied
upon.6
9.4.    As per the ‘Opening of a new or Higher Course of Study or Training
(Including Postgraduate Course of Study or Training) and Increase of
Admission Capacity in any Course of Study or Training (Including a
Postgraduate Course of Study or Training) (Amendment) Regulations,
2016’, only those medical colleges whose medical qualification is
recognized under Section 11(2) of the Indian Medical Council Act, 1956
[“IMC Act”] “for that particular intake capacity/ increased intake
capacity for which Letter of Permission was granted” are eligible to apply
for any increase. Since LOP for academic year 2021-22 was granted for
200 seats to Petitioner college, it is entitled to apply only for 200 seats in
subsequent academic year(s).
9.5.    Clause 3(1) of Part II of ‘Opening of a new or Higher Course of Study
or Training (Including Postgraduate Course of Study or Training) and
Increase of Admission Capacity in any Course of Study or Training
(Including a Postgraduate Course of Study or Training) (Amendment)

Regulations, 2018’ states that a medical college shall be entitled to make
an application to increase the admission capacity, once the concerned
qualification against the sanctioned intake has been recognized under
IMC Act. Notification dated 08th September, 2016 granted recognition to
Petitioner college for annual intake of 150 MBBS students since 2016.
9.6.      Once Petitioner college accepted increased capacity to the extent of
200 seats, in terms of Regulation 8(5) of the ‘Establishment of Medical
College Regulations (Amendment), 2019’, it can only be permitted to seek
renewal of same intake (i.e.,200). Further, permission to admit certain
number of students may be renewed on yearly basis, subject to
achievements of annual targets.7 Such yearly evaluation of performance
shall be carried out for first and third renewal, until recognition of said
intake capacity is granted. Therefore, there is no provision for increase in
seats midway – the same gets renewed up till third renewal and thereafter,
until revised recognition is granted.
9.7.      The Supreme Court has held that once experts, upon inspection,
determine that a college is deficient, Courts of law cannot sit in appeal
over such inspection report.8
10.        In contrast, Mr. Maninder Singh, argues the following:
10.1.      Petitioner college has augmented its infrastructural, teaching, and
other facilities to fulfil the statutory parameters for 250 students.
10.2.      Inspection conducted on 24th and 25th August, 2022 was in respect of
Annexure R-2/20 to Additional Affidavit dated 18th October, 2022.
Regulation 8(3)(1A) of Establishment of Medical College Regulations (Amendment), 2020.
Digitally Signed          W.P.(C) 5339/2022                                                                      Page 7 of 23
250 seats, and on that basis, deficiencies noted in the inspection report are
conclusive. A comparative analysis of inspection reports for academic
years 2021-22 and 2022-23 shows that there is deficiency of 1.02% in
faculty only, but the same is within the permissible limits. NMC has
grossly erred in evaluation of its shortcomings.
10.3.       No action was taken on Petitioner college’s representation dated 09th
September, 2022 to Respondents requesting them to reconsider its case for
grant of permission for 250 seats. Respondents deliberately delayed
consideration of Petitioner college’s application. MARB maliciously
passed order dated 10th October, 2022 granting 200 seats to Petitioner
college after filing of C.M. APPL. 44265/2022.
10.4.       Deficiencies brought out in the additional affidavit are non-existent
and arbitrary. In some aspects, NMC has capriciously applied norms that
are no longer in force. All requirements other than shortage of 1 Associate
Professor in orthopaedic department, have been fully met by Petitioner
college for 250 MBBS admissions.
10.5.       Petitioner college was unable to upload its application for 250 seats
on Respondents’ web portal compelling it to send applications by way of
letters dated 08th June, 2022 and 21st April, 2022 for increase in seats.
10.6.       In the circumstances of the case where Petitioner college is within the
permissible limit of deficiencies, a direction for its re-inspection would be
unfruitful and contrary to law. Reliance is placed on Rajiv Memorial
Academic Welfare Society v. Union of India.9
Manohar Lal Sharma v. Medical Council of India, (2013) 10 SCC 60; Medical Council of India v.
Kalinga Institute of Medical Sciences, (2016) 11 SCC 530 and Medical Council of India v. Vedanta

10.7.       Having regard to the dire need of more doctors, which has risen
manifold in the recent times, the Government has adopted a lenient
approach and is doing away with several conditions/ requirements for
establishing new medical colleges/ increasing number of existing seats.
Respondents’ actions are in stark contradiction to said policy. Reliance is
placed upon clause 3(1) of the ‘Opening of a new or Higher Course of
Study or Training (Including Postgraduate Course of Study or Training)
and Increase of Admission Capacity in any Course of Study or Training
(Including a Postgraduate Course of Study or Training) (Amendment)
Regulations, 2018’ which provides that medical colleges which are not yet
recognised for MBBS courses, can apply for start of post-graduate courses
in various fields.
11.        Under the scheme of National Medical Commission Act, 2019 [“NMC
Act”], no medical college can increase its seats without obtaining a prior
approval from the MARB. For the purpose of granting permission, MARB is
entitled to conduct assessment/ inspection of such colleges for evaluation of
their performance vis-à-vis benchmarks set out in law.10 Indeed, in matters of
medical education, it is not for the Court to sit in appeal over deductions of
an expert body in respect of insufficiencies found in an educational institute;
but when it is demonstrated that Respondent-authorities have acted in
defilement of extant rules, it is incumbent upon the Court to step in and
Section 28 of the NMC Act, 2019.
Digitally Signed          W.P.(C) 5339/2022                                                  Page 9 of 23
rectify the injustice so caused.11 With that being the position, the Court has
proceeded to evaluate the veracity of assertions of NMC qua deficiencies/
shortcomings pointed out for grant of 250 seats in the additional affidavit,
keeping also in view the findings given in inspection report, which is relied
upon by both the counsel.
12.       NMC’s primary opposition is that since the Petitioner college had
accepted increased intake capacity of 50 seats from academic year 2021-22
onwards, it can only be considered for further increase after grant of revised
recognition for said increased intake (50 seats) in terms of Regulation 8(5) of
the Establishment of Medical College Regulations (Amendment), 2019. On
this aspect, judgement of the Supreme Court in Sree Balaji Medical College
& Hospital v. Union of India becomes pertinent, wherein it was held that
permission and recognition are two distinct aspects – permission is for
change in admission capacity, and recognition is of college/ institution.12 A
medical college, once recognised, is only required to obtain permission for
enhancement. There is no merit in Mr. Singhdev’s endeavour to distinguish
the above-noted judgment on the ground that it pertains to repealed Sections
10A and 10B of the IMC Act, 1956. Sections 28 and 29 of the NMC Act
which lay down the procedure for grant of permission to establish new
medical colleges or increase admission capacity, are akin to Sections 10A
and 10B of IMC Act. The distinction between permission and recognition, as
explained in Sree Balaji Medical College & Hospital (Supra), would thus,
hold good and is still relevant to facts of the present case. Therefore, for any
See: M.K. Shah Medical College and Research Centre v. Union of India and Anr., 2022 SCC OnLine
Digitally Signed         W.P.(C) 5339/2022                                                                     Page 10 of 23
increase in the admission capacity, only permission is needed and there is no
requirement of recognition of the degree. Pertinently, when the increased
intake is objected to, and strongly contested by Petitioner college, it is a
completely misconceived argument that increase is to be restricted only to
recognized seats.
13.      It must also be noted that LOP for academic session 2021-22 for
increase of 50 seats was issued under interim order of the Court. The fact
that Petitioner college accepted the same and submitted its undertaking as
per applicable regulations cannot be read as a bar for further increase.
Respondents did not challenge the interim order, instead, in compliance
thereof, issued a LOP for increase of 50 seats; thus, just because Petitioner
college submitted an affidavit of acceptance, it does not mean that its request
for increase of seats stood reduced to 200 seats. Respondent’s objection is
based on illusory grounds, and is unsustainable. Insofar as acceptance of 200
seats for the year 2022-23 is concerned, the admission/ counselling process
for said year is already ongoing. Petitioner college has submitted an affidavit
of acceptance in order to participate in the admission process, but that also
cannot be construed as a waiver of its rights to seek enhancement up to 250
seats.
14.      Next, NMC has harped on lack of procedural compliance. Petitioner
college had applied for 250 seats for the academic years 2021-22 as well as
2022-23. NMC’s submission that Petitioner college did not submit an
application for enhanced seat intake is entirely contrary to the records. NMC
Digitally Signed         W.P.(C) 5339/2022                                                   Page 11 of 23
has stressed that MARB was accepting applications in a particular format
only through its online portal and for 2022-23, this process was not adhered
to during the window period; letters dated 21st April, 2022 and 08th June,
2022 cannot be considered as valid applications. On the other hand,
Petitioner college has explained that online facility could not have been
availed of as the same was restricted by NMC itself by disabling the link for
applying for increase in seats in respect of Petitioner college, and for that
reason, it had to send the afore-noted communications requesting
consideration for 250 seats. The above reason is indeed plausible,
considering that NMC regards Petitioner college to be ineligible for
increase. Be that as it may, the afore-noted letters in the nature of
applications, were received by NMC, but never responded. Further, an
inspection has also been carried for the year 2022-23.
15.     Now, coming to the question of whether inspection conducted on 24th-
25th August, 2022 was in respect of 250 seats and whether the inspection
report demonstrates satisfaction of statutory requirements by Petitioner
college. In this regard, it must first be recorded that the inspection, if not
done for 250 seats, ought to have been done keeping that in mind, since
Petitioner college’s request for increase remained the same. Nevertheless,
since this aspect was strongly contested, the Court vide order dated 13th
October, 2022 afforded NMC complete opportunity to consider the
inspection report towards increasing intake to 250 MBBS students for
academic year 2022-23, in reference to applicable regulations and point out
deficiencies, if any, to the Court. In pursuance thereto, additional affidavit
dated 18th October, 2022 filed by NMC, brings forth following deficiencies
Digitally Signed        W.P.(C) 5339/2022                                                  Page 12 of 23
which are regarded as grounds to deny the request by NMC:
“(i) Faculty Deficiency - 6.9%. The petitioner medical college is conducting various
postgraduate courses and hence, the requirement of faculty for the said
postgraduate courses shall also have to be added to the faculty requirements of
MBBS course. Total faculty required is 202 and there is a deficiency of 14 faculty
members. A detailed department-wise chart of faculty & resident deficiency is
annexed herewith as ANNEXURE R-2/22.
(ii) Resident Deficiency - 3.9%. Total residents required is 102 and there is a
deficiency of 4 residents.
(iii) 3 Examinations Halls are required, however, only 1 is available.
(iv) 1 Clinical Unit is short - required 35 Units but 34 Units are available. 35 Units
are required for 1040 beds, however, 34 Units are available for 1050 beds.”
16.     Thus, as per NMC, Petitioner college lacks in four aspects viz. faculty,
residents, examination hall and clinical units. No other deficiency has been
highlighted/ argued during the course of submissions. The afore-mentioned
aspects are dealt separately, in detail hereinbelow.
17.     Based on MARB’s analysis, NMC has alleged 6.9% deficiency in
teaching staff/ faculty, and contended that for 250 seats, faculty strength
should be 202 seats. The deficiency for each department is tabulated as
Digitally Signed        W.P.(C) 5339/2022                                                                      Page 13 of 23
18.     Although requirement of 202 faculty members is disputed by
Petitioner college and basis for such computation has not been explained by
NMC, however, since Mr. Maninder Singh has argued on demurrer
regarding factual basis of NMC’s claim of faculty strength, the Court has
proceeded on the assumption that requirement under applicable regulations
for Petitioner college is 202 faculty members. However, before proceeding
further, it must be reiterated that as per the afore-mentioned communication
dated 07th July, 2017 issued by Medical Council of India, private medical
colleges, such as Petitioner college, are entitled to 5% relaxation in
deficiency in teaching faculty and residents. NMC admits the above position
in paragraph 33 of the additional affidavit.
19.     As per the inspection report, only deficiency of 1 associate professor
in the orthopaedic department was present in Petitioner college. However,
when the said report is applied for 250 seats, it is contended that Petitioner
college is lacking 14 faculty members. Nonetheless, as against required
strength of 202, since Petitioner college would be entitled to the benefit of
relaxation norms, it is required to have minimum strength of 192 teachers
[i.e., 202 - 10 (5% of 202 seats)]. In that light, afore-said shortcoming of 14
members is being scrutinized hereinafter:
Dentistry department
19.1. In dentistry department, NMC has recorded a shortage of 3 faculty
members. As per Minimum Requirements for Annual MBBS Admissions
Regulations, 2020 [hereinafter, “MBBS Regulations, 2020”], “a separate
Digitally Signed        W.P.(C) 5339/2022                                                    Page 14 of 23
department of Dentistry/Dental faculty is not required where a dental
college is available in same campus/city and run by the same
management.”13 Petitioner college has a separate and functioning dental
college situated within its campus, as noted in the inspection report in
as per MSR    faculty        (UG
19.2. The assessors also categorically mention in their report that since a
dental college is functioning within the same premises, dental faculty is
not required. Therefore, there is absolutely no basis for NMC to postulate
that Petitioner college was not having the required teaching faculty for
dentistry. The shortage of teachers in dentistry department being reckoned
as deficiency is a flawed conclusion. The alleged deficiency of 3 faculty
members must therefore be reduced from the figure of 14. In fact, the
Court perceives NMC’s stance of including the dental faculty towards
total deficiencies as an attempt to mislead the Court.
19.3. NMC alleges that there is shortage of 1 assistant professor in
Annexure IV(A): Requirements of Faculty and Residents for 250 MBBS admissions annually.
Digitally Signed        W.P.(C) 5339/2022                                                                      Page 15 of 23
physiology department. In this regard, inspection report records the
as per MSR      faculty        (UG
19.4. MBBS Regulations, 2020 provides that for a college with 250 seats, 1
professor, 2 associate professors and 5 assistant professors, are required.
As can be seen from the above tabulation, the inspection team has noted
that there are only 4 assistant professors in Petitioner college in concerned
department, however, apart from 2 professors, the Dean of Petitioner
college viz. Dr. S. Venkidusamy, being a professor in Physiology, was not
considered as part of the teaching staff. He was also present at the time of
inspection. Mr. Singhdev explained that since for 200 seats, Petitioner
college was found to be compliant, Dr. Venkidusamy was not considered.
Irrespective, he ought to have been considered as part of the faculty as he
possesses requisite qualifications and experience of a professor.14 Similar
approach was adopted by a coordinate bench of this Court in M.K. Shah
Medical College and Research Centre (Supra). Therefore, his inclusion
would take the total strength of professors in physiology department to 3.
Further, undeniably, excess teaching faculty of higher cadre can

compensate the deficiency in lower cadre of the same department –
therefore, dearth of 1 assistant professor stands compensated.15 NMC’s
finding in respect of shortage in physiology department has no lawful
footing, and cannot be countenanced.
19.5. For microbiology department, the inspection report notes as follows:
as per MSR  faculty     (UG
19.6. The department-wise chart of faculty and residents annexed with the
additional affidavit by NMC mentions availability of 3 professors, 1
associate professor and 2 assistant professors. However, the same is at
variance with findings in inspection report in as much as the assessors cite
availability of 4 assistant professors and not 2. NMC has disregarded 2
assistant professors who were on maternity leave while ascertaining the
deficiencies, which approach, in the opinion of the Court, is contrary to
law and outrightly fallacious. No justification is demonstrated to exclude
them. The said department is short of 1 associate professor, but the same
Refer: Minimum Requirements for Annual MBBS Admissions Regulations, 2022.

is compensated by extra professors and as such, there is no deficiency.
19.7. In general surgery department, NMC opined that Petitioner college
must have 1 professor, 8 associate professors and 15 assistant professors,
thus, it is short of 1 assistant professor. In the inspection report, faculty
strength for general surgery department is as follows:
as per MSR     faculty  (UG
19.8. It is noted that there are 4 professors in the above-captioned
department, against the requirement, as per NMC, of 1 professor. Mr.
Maninder Singh had argued that Professor Dr. N. Vijayan, who was
present during the inspection, has not been counted; however,
examination of the inspection report and attendance sheet reveals that
Professor Dr. N. Vijayan has been included in the 4 Professors of said
department. Nevertheless, excess of professors in general surgery
compensates deficiency of 1 assistant professor, and therefore, no
deficiency as per norms is made out.

19.9. Mr. Maninder Singh has conceded to deficiency of only 1 associate
professor in orthopaedics team of Petitioner college. However, insofar as
deficiencies in respiratory medicine, orthopaedics and ophthalmology are
concerned, the Court finds no reason to delve further, as after deducting
alleged shortage of 6 faculty members in respect of the afore-discussed
departments, shortage would come to 8, which falls within relaxation
norms.
20.      It manifests from the above discussion, that deficiencies in teaching
staff of Petitioner college are far less than what NMC has portrayed, and is
well within permissible/ relaxation limit of 5%. NMC’s assertions, based on
MARB’s (expert assessors) findings, of deficiency of 6.9% in faculty, is
demonstrably misconceived and erroneous. Petitioner college fulfils the
criteria for increasing its admission capacity in MBBS course from 150 to
250, as per applicable norms.
21.      With respect to residents, although NMC’s finding of deficiencies
amounting to 3.9% has been disputed by Petitioner college, however, as
existing policy permits relaxation of up to 5% deficiency in residents, there
is no reason for the Court to venture into the basis of such calculation.
22.     According to NMC, Petitioner college is required to have 3
examination halls as per law, but only 1 is available. This assertion has no
statutory backing and is contradicted by entry A.1.9 of schedule 1 to MBBS
Digitally Signed         W.P.(C) 5339/2022                                                    Page 19 of 23
Regulations, 2020 which provides that a separate examination hall is only
desirable. The same when read along with the inspection report, which
records that Petitioner college has 1 examination hall “non-gallery type,
available with 250 capacity”, demonstrates that this is not a valid ground to
preclude Petitioner college from holding 250 admissions in its MBBS
program.
23.      NMC contends that Petitioner college must have 35 units for 1040
hospital beds, but only 34 units are available. However, as per MBBS
Regulations, 2020, for intake of 250 students, requirement is 1030 beds for
37 units. Qua total number of hospital beds available at Petitioner college,
the inspection team observed as follows:
24.     The total number of beds available at Petitioner college are more than
what is statutorily mandated for 250 seats i.e., 1050 beds. Considering the
same, this made-up deficiency is palpably misconceived and untenable.
Digitally Signed        W.P.(C) 5339/2022                                                   Page 20 of 23
25.      From the foregoing discussion, it emerges that there is a deliberate
effort on the part of NMC to somehow justify its entirely untenable /
unsustainable and ex-facie arbitrary action of artificially raising deficiency
in faculty to 6.9%, which falls outside relaxation limit (i.e., 5%).
Respondents’ stand is not only incorrect, and flawed, but also depicts
arbitrariness on their part. Petitioner college has demonstrated that it fulfils
all the requirements for grant of 250 seats, and is entitled for that capacity
for the academic year 2022-23.
26.     Before issuing final directions for intake of students for academic
session 2022-23 as prayed for C.M. APPL. 44265/2022, it would be apposite
to address the issue of increase of intake for academic session 2021-22. As
noted above, Petitioner college was permitted to undertake 200 admissions
for the year 2021-22 by the interim order. The said academic session is over
and students are enrolled against 200 sanctioned seats. On a fresh inspection
in respect of academic session 2022-23, Petitioner college was found to be
compliant for 200 seats. Vide communication dated 10th October 2022,
NMC has conveyed approval/ permission of MARB for first renewal of
admission with increased intake of 50 seats of second batch. In light of the
above development, and considering the fact that there can be no increase of
seats retrospectively for the academic year 2021-22, it would be a moot
exercise to examine the infrastructural and other capacities of Petitioner
college for that year vis-à-vis deficiencies pointed out in the second appeal
order dated 17th March, 2022. In view thereof, the interim order dated 30th
Digitally Signed        W.P.(C) 5339/2022                                                   Page 21 of 23
March, 2022 is confirmed and it is held that Petitioner college is entitled to
enhance its intake to 200 seats for academic year 2021-22.
27.     As regards 2022-23, since the decision of NMC to deny increase in
seats is ex-facie based on irrelevant considerations and in ignorance of
relevant materials, it is a fit case for this Court to exercise its jurisdiction
under Article 226 of the Constitution of India, 1950 and issue a writ of
mandamus compelling performance of the discretion conferred upon NMC
in order to prevent injustice to Petitioners. Since no other impediment has
been brought forth, in the facts of the case, directing NMC/ MARB to re-
inspect Petitioner college is not required as it fulfils all parameters
established under extant regulations. Accordingly, the present petition is
allowed with the following directions:
27.1     Impugned orders dated 31st December, 2021, 21st February, 2022 and
17th March, 2022 are set-aside.
27.2     Respondents are directed to permit Petitioner college to take
admissions of 250 students in the ongoing counselling of NEET UG 2022
and for that purpose, Respondents shall forthwith issue necessary
directions and intimate the order to competent authority/ body of the
Government of Tamil Nadu to add 250 seats in its seat matrix.
28.       Before parting, it must be noted that to meet the rising need of more
qualified doctors to serve country’s population, augmentation of medical
infrastructure is crucial, and hence, role of regulatory bodies like NMC is
unquestionably significant. The authorisation procedure must indeed be
strictly adhered to ensure that there is no decline in the quality of medical

education. However, at the same time, deserving colleges must not be
unfairly denied the opportunity to contribute in enhancing the strength of
medical professionals. In the present case, NMC through its acts of omission
and commission, has not only violated the norms laid down under relevant
regulations, but also completely disregarded the legislative and policy
decisions of the Government by issuance of afore-noted impugned orders.
Although Mr. Singhdev has very ably assisted the Court, the attitude
exhibited by NMC remains highly questionable. Instead of assisting the
Court, the additional affidavit filed pursuant to directions of the Court has
presented non-existent deficiencies, based on false and erroneous facts, in an
attempt to deny Petitioner college, the relief it is entitled to, under law. NMC
must not lose sight of its responsibility to maintain accuracy of facts/
information presented to the Court. Having regard to the circumstances noted
above, Chairperson of NMC is directed to enquire into the circumstances that
have resulted in filing of the additional affidavit with inaccurate facts, and
take appropriate action.
29.      The present petition is disposed of along with pending application(s).
30.      The next date of hearing i.e., 15th November, 2022, stands cancelled
