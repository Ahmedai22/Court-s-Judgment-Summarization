that the application came to be rejected,
whereby            the      Tribunal           declined                  to
appreciate            the     ground         for        premature
withdrawal as having received P.R. of USA
and has inclination to shift to America.
2.   Mr.         Tirth      Nayak        submitted          that            the
petitioner’s daughter is at America and
because of his age, he proposes to stay
along with her and since he has received
P.R. of USA, he already got his tickets
booked for September 12, 2022. Mr. Nayak
further submitted that the petitioner is
a      senior        citizen       and     because          of         his
advancing           age,   he     would      be    in      need          of
money          for   his   own       medical      purpose              and
further          the   money       would     be     helpful              as
that          would    give       him      the     freedom               of
expending for his own purpose.
3.   Mr.       Tirth      Nayak   placed        reliance          on        the
judgment in the case of A.V. Padma & Ors.
Vs.        R.     Venugopal       &     Ors.,     reported               in
(2012)          3   SCC  378       to    contend        that           the
Tribunal is required to give a thoughtful
consideration to the genuine requirements
of         the      claimant           and    should              avoid
Page 2 of 13
mechanical          approach         ignoring      the         object
and spirit of the Act. A.V. Padma’s case
(supra) refers to the guidelines issued
in      the     case   of    General       Manager,            Kerala
reported in (1994) 2 SCC 176. In Susamma
Thomas’s          case    (supra),         while       approving
the judgment of the Gujarat High Court in
the case of Muljibhai Ajarambhai Harijan
reported in 1982 (1) GLR 756, the Apex
Court           has      offered           the         following
guidelines:-
should,      in    the       case   of     minors,
invariably       order         the   amount            of
compensation awarded to the minor
be     invested      in      long   term       fixed
deposits at least till the date of
the minor attaining majority. The
expenses incurred by the guardian
or next friend may, however, be
allowed to be withdrawn;
Page 3 of 13
(ii)      In the case of illiterate
claimants also the Claims Tribunal
should   follow        the      procedure          set
out in (i) above, but if lump sum
payment is required for effecting
purchases      of        any      movable             or
immovable       property            such           as,
agricultural implements, rickshaw,
etc.,    to    earn          a   living,           the
Tribunal     may        consider         such           a
request after making sure that the
amount is actually spent for the
purpose and the demand is not a
ruse to withdraw money;
(iii)     In    the          case    of       semi-
literate     persons            the     Tribunal
should   ordinarily            resort     to       the
procedure     set      out      at   (i)      above
unless     it     is         satisfied,            for
reasons to be stated in writing,
that   the   whole         or    part     of       the
amount is required for expanding
and    existing         business         or        for
purchasing        some          property              as
mentioned      in        (ii)      above           for
Page 4 of 13
earning his livelihood, in which
case the Tribunal will ensure that
the     amount     is      invested      for        the
purpose for which it is demanded
(iv)       In    the       case    of    literate
persons      also        the     Tribunal           may
resort to the procedure indicated
in     (i)   above,           subject     to        the
relaxation       set        out   in   (ii)         and
(iii) above, if having regard to
the     age,    fiscal         background           and
strata     of    society         to   which         the
claimant      belongs          and   such      other
considerations,             the    Tribunal            in
the      larger        interest          of         the
claimant       and       with      a    view           to
ensuring        the         safety       of         the
compensation awarded to him thinks
it necessary to do order;
(v)        In the case of widows the
Claims Tribunal should invariably
follow the procedure set out in
(i) above;
(vi)      In  personal         injury       cases
if further treatment is necessary
the    Claims     Tribunal         on       being
satisfied    about        the   same,       which
shall    be   recorded          in    writing,
permit withdrawal of such amount
as is necessary for incurring the
expenses for such treatment;
(vii)     In   all        cases     in      which
investment     in       long     term       fixed
deposits is made it should be on
condition that the Bank will not
permit any loan or advance on the
fixed deposit and interest on the
amount   invested         is   paid     monthly
directly to the claimant or his
guardian, as the case may be;
(viii)    In    all         cases     Tribunal
should    grant       to     the    claimants
liberty to apply for withdrawal in
case of an emergency. To meet with
such a contingency, if the amount
awarded is substantial, the Claims
Page 6 of 13
Tribunal   may     invest       it   in      more
than one Fixed Deposit so that if
need   be  one   such       F.D.R.     can         be
liquidated.”
4.   In the case of A.V. Padma (supra), while
appreciating the guidelines issued in the
case        of Susamma   Thomas        (supra),         it        has
been observed as under:-
“7. The     expression            used             in
guideline No. (iv) issued by this
Court is that in the case of
literate persons also the Tribunal
may    resort     to       the     procedure
indicated in guideline No. (i),
whereas in the guideline Nos. (i),
(ii),     (iii)         and      (v),           the
expression     used         is    that          the
Tribunal should. Moreover, in the
case of literate persons, the
Tribunal     may        resort       to         the
procedure indicated in guideline
No. (i) only if, having regard to
the age, fiscal background and
strata of the society to which the
claimant belongs and such other
considerations,            the       Tribunal
thinks that in the larger interest
of the claimant and with a view to
ensure     the        safety        of          the
compensation        awarded,          it           is
necessary to invest the amount of
compensation in long term fixed
Page 7 of 13
8. Thus,    sufficient           discretion
has been given to the Tribunal not
to insist on investment of the
compensation amount in long term
fixed deposit and to release even
the whole amount in the case of
literate persons. However, the
Tribunals are often taking a very
rigid stand and are mechanically
ordering in almost all cases that
the amount of compensation shall
be invested in long term fixed
deposit. They are taking such a
rigid   and    mechanical            approach
without      understanding                      and
appreciating the distinction drawn
by this Court in the case of
minors, illiterate claimants and
widows and in the case of semi-
literate and literate persons. It
needs to be clarified that the
above guidelines were issued by
this Court only to safeguard the
interests    of          the     claimants,
particularly              the          minors,
illiterates     and         others         whose
amounts are sought to be withdrawn
on some fictitious grounds. The
guidelines     were          not      to           be
understood    to        mean      that          the
Tribunals were to take a rigid
stand    while          considering                an
application seeking release of the
money.
9. The      guidelines            cast              a
responsibility on the Tribunals to
pass   appropriate          orders        after
examining each case on its own
merits. However, it is seen that
even in cases when there is no
possibility or chance of the feed
being   frittered          away     by         the
beneficiary owing to ignorance,
illiteracy or susceptibility to
exploitation, investment of the
amount of compensation in long
term fixed deposit is directed by
the Tribunals as a matter of
course and in a routine manner,
ignoring the object and the spirit
of the guidelines issued by this
Court and the genuine requirements
of the claimants. Even in the case
of literate persons, the Tribunals
are     automatically               ordering
investment    of        the    amount             of
compensation in long term fixed
deposit without recording that
having regard to the age or fiscal
background or the strata of the
society to which the claimant
belongs      or            such           other
considerations,           the       Tribunal
thinks it necessary to direct such
investment in the larger interests
of the claimant and with a view to
ensure    the        safety        of          the
compensation awarded to him.
10. The    Tribunals          very        often
dispose     of         the      claimant's
application for withdrawal of the
amount   of    compensation              in         a
Page 9 of 13
mechanical         manner          and      without
proper application of mind. This
has resulted in serious injustice
and hardship to the claimants. The
Tribunals appear to think that in
view of the guidelines issued by
this Court, in every case the
amount of compensation should be
invested        in       long       term        fixed
deposit and under no circumstances
the       Tribunal        can      release           the
entire amount of compensation to
the       claimant         even      if     it          is
required by him. Hence a change of
attitude and approach on the part
of the Tribunals is necessary in
the interest of justice.”
5.   The         Tribunal      observed          that       the          only
ground          seeking     premature          withdrawal                is
that he got P.R. of USA and is going to
America,           which     the        Tribunal         did           not
consider           as   a     valid        ground         for          the
premature           withdrawal          and     has       observed
that there is no other valid, genuine and
reasonable              ground            and         therefore,
premature           withdrawal           of    FDR       was           not
granted.          It   is    required         to    be       noticed
that        the    claimant       has     retired        from          his
work         as   a   wholesale          book     seller.              The
Claim Petition was filed for the injury,
which          he  sustained          during    the       accident
Page 10 of 13
occurred          on   29.6.2010.           He     was        granted
compensation          amount          of   Rs.6,52,730/-                  at
the rate of 7.5% per annum and 30% of the
amount         was   given       to      him    by      way        of       a
cheque,          while     70%        of    the     amount              was
deposited          in    the        FDR     no.290603              since
22.2.2019. As per the contention, he had
been         residing    in      USA      since      2017          along
with          his   daughter            on   the        basis             of
Permanent           Resident            Card     of       USA           and
because of his age, he is now planning to
settle          permanently            in    USA.        Necessary
documents          in   support          of   his      contention
have been produced on record.
6.   It       appears      from        the      order        that            the
learned Tribunal has failed to consider
the        object     and      the       intention           of         the
directions so given in Susamma Thomas’s
case (supra). The present claimant was a
trader.         Further,       he       proposes        to       settle
down in USA. The amount invested in the
FDR has now become his necessity as he
wants to use the same money for his own
purpose.          The   intention           of     putting              the
claimant’s money in the FDR is for his
own        benefit     to      ensure        safety          of         the
Page 11 of 13
compensation amount so awarded. Further,
the amount as prayed for at the premature
withdrawal           is     for         meeting        with            the
personal exigencies of the life and the
Tribunal          ought     to       have    considered                the
same and should have granted the amount
as      the      compensation           money     is      for          the
claimant. Here in this case, the claimant
proposes to settle permanently in USA and
the         amount     invested           in    FDR        on          the
maturity date would go to the claimant.
However, in case if he is not present in
India          to   receive         the    same,        the         said
amount          would   be    of       no  use     to      him         and
thus, this fact ought to have been kept
in           mind       while            considering                   the
bonafides/genuineness                   of   the    grounds              so
raised           for   the        prayer       of       premature
withdrawal.
7.   The guidelines, as laid down in Susamma
Thomas’s             case           (supra),            cast               a
responsibility           on      the      Tribunal         to       pass
appropriate           orders        after     examining             each
case on its own merits. In case of the
present petitioner, there is no scope of
any exploitation since the claimant knows
Page 12 of 13
and understands about his own welfare and
thus, necessary orders are required to be
passed          taking     into         consideration                  the
larger          interest       of        the     claimant                as
mechanical disposition of the application
without          proper    application            of      mind           as
observed           in  the       case       of     A.V.           Padma
(supra) results in serious injustice and
hardships to the claimant.
8.   Thus,          taking     into          consideration                  the
circumstances             as           pleaded           by            the
petitioner          –  claimant,           the    petition               is
allowed and the petitioner is permitted
to have a premature withdrawal of FDR no.
290603. The Bank concerned is directed to
pay        the    amount    along         with    interest               so
accrued           on    the         said      FDR         to           the
petitioner–claimant                 on     receipt        of        this
order.
