1.       In All India Judges’ Association vs. Union of India1, (All India Judges’ Association
Case-I), this Court had issued a slew of directions, which included (i) the setting up of an
All India Judicial Service; (ii) bringing about uniformity in the designation of officers; (iii)
raising of the age of retirement to 60 years; (iv) provision of residential accommodation
to judicial officers etc. One of the directions so issued, which is relevant for our present
purpose, reads as follows:-
“63(iv) As and when the Pay Commissions/Committees are set up in the States and Union
Territories, the question of appropriate pay scales of judicial officers be specifically referred and
2.       Petitions for reviewing the aforesaid Judgment were filed by the Union of India as
well as by various States, objecting to certain specific directions contained therein. These
review petitions were disposed of by this Court by an Order dated 24.08.1993 in All India
Judges’ Association vs. Union of India2, which came to be referred to as All India Judges’
Association Case-II. Though certain directions issued in All India Judges’ Association-I
were modified in the judgment in All India Judges’ Association Case-II, the above
direction contained in paragraph 63(iv) of the original judgment was not modified.
3.      In All India Judges’ Association Case-II, the necessity to maintain parity in status
between the Judges and the Political
Executive, and not between the Judges and the Administrative Executive, was
highlighted. It will be appropriate to quote the first part of paragraph 36 of the decision in
“we have already discussed the need to make a distinction between the political and the
administrative executive and to appreciate that parity in status can only be between Judges and the
political executive and not between Judges and the Administrative executive. Hence the earlier
approach of comparison between the service conditions of the Judges and those of the
administrative executive has to be abandoned and the service conditions of the Judges which are
wrongly linked to those of the administrative executive have to be revised to meet the special needs
of the judicial service.”
4.      Moreover, this Court highlighted in All India Judges’ Association Case-II, the need
to keep Judges above their essential wants, considering the distinct nature of Judges’
duties, the society’s expectations, the lifestyle of the Judge and the occupational hazards
to which he is exposed.
5.      Subsequently the Government of India constituted the First National Judicial Pay
Commission (FNJPC) under the Chairmanship of Mr. Justice K.J. Shetty. As a
consequence, the reference to the 5th Central Pay Commission, of the question of
revision of pay scales of judicial officers was dropped.
6.      The FNJPC submitted its Report on 11.11.1999 recommending adoption of what
is known as `Master Pay Scales’ comprising of 44 stages. The Commission
recommended fixed quantum increments with six incremental rates from Rs.250 to
Rs.500, spanning over 44 specified stages.
7.      By a judgment dated 21.03.2002 passed in All India Judges’ Association vs. Union
of India 3 , (All India Judges’ Association case-III), this Court recommended the
implementation of the revised scales of pay with effect from 1.07.1996. However, it was
directed that the judicial officers shall be paid salary in revised pay scales with effect from
1.07.2002 and the arrears of salary for the period from 1.07.1996 to 30.06.2002 was
directed to be paid either in cash or by crediting the same into the provident fund
accounts of the officers.
8.      After the constitution of the 6th Central Pay Commission, the question of revision
of the scales of pay of judicial officers came up once again before this Court in All India
Judges’ Association vs. Union of India4, (All India Judges’ Association Case-IV). By an
order dated 28.04.2009 this Court appointed Mr. Justice E. Padmanabhan, a retired
Judge of the High Court of Madras as a One man Committee, to make suitable
recommendations. This Committee submitted a report on 17.07.2009.
9.      Thereafter, this Court passed an Order on 4.05.2010 recording that most of the
States have accepted the recommendations, though there was a dispute about the date
of implementation. Moreover, this Court directed the States to implement Justice E.
Padmanabhan Committee’s recommendations with effect from 01.01.2006.
10.   Nearly 5 years after the order passed in All India Judges’ Association Case-IV, the
present writ petition came to be filed by the All India Judges’ Association in the year 2015,
seeking various reliefs including constitution of All India Judicial Commission to review
the service conditions of judicial officers. In this writ petition, an order was passed on
09.05.2017, appointing the Second National Judicial Pay Commission (SNJPC), with Mr.
Justice P. Venkatarama Reddy, a former Judge of this Court as its Chairman and Mr. R.
Basant, a former Judge of the Kerala High Court as its member. The terms of reference
of the Commission, as agreed to by all parties, were extracted in the Order dated
11.   Accordingly a notification was issued on 16.11.2017 constituting the Second
National Judicial Pay Commission. Some of the terms of reference of the Commission
(i)   to evolve the principles which should governthe structure of pay and other
emoluments of Judicial Officers.
(ii) to examine the existing structure of emoluments and conditions of service and to
make recommendations including post retirement benefits.
(iii) to examine the work methods and work environment as also the variety of
allowances and benefits and to suggest rationalization.

13.    Though the recommendations of SNJPC covers various aspects, for the present,
we propose to deal only with the revision of the pay structure. This is for the reason that
after the implementation of the recommendations of Justice E. Padmanabhan
Committee, with effect from 01.01.2006, a period of 16 years have passed without any
revision of the same. In contrast, the 7th Central Pay Commission has already been
implemented with effect from 01.01.2016. Therefore, there is a need to atleast implement
the revised pay structure immediately so as to alleviate the sufferings of the judicial
14.    As a matter of fact, the scales of pay of Government servants are raised in some
States once in five years/six years and by the Central Government once in 10 years.
Judicial Officers are not covered by the Pay Commissions constituted by the Central or
State Governments. Therefore, there is an imperative need to revise the pay structure
15.    One of the main objections to the revision of pay structure as proposed by SNJPC,
is the application of the multiplier of 2.81 and above. But this objection has already been
taken by some of the States and is liable to be rejected for the two reasons, namely, (i)
that the 7th Central Pay Commission has applied a multiplier of 2.81 in respect of certain
categories of All India Service Officers; and (ii) that Justice Padmanabhan Committee
actually applied a multiplier of 3.07.
16.    As a matter of fact, SNJPC, before making its recommendations, considered three
modules, i.e., (1) Master Pay Scale Method; (2) Pay Matrix Method; and (3) Fixed Pay
Method. After examining the advantages and disadvantages of all the three modules, the
SNJPC has adopted Pay Matrix Method, as it had already been adopted by the 7th
Central Pay Commission. A fourth module, namely, Fixed Pay Pattern was also
examined but was not accepted, as it was a new concept and had not been tested
anywhere else.
17.    Having considered the Report of the SNJPC, the objections of the Union and the
State Governments and the submissions of the learned amicus, we are of the view that
the revision of pay structure as recommended by SNJPC, indicated in table-1 appended,
hereto shall be accepted.
18.    This will lead us to two ancillary issues, namely (i) effective date; and (ii) arrears.
19.    Since implementation of the recommendations of Justice E. Padmanabhan
Committee was with effect from 01.01.2006, the revision of pay structure as
recommended by SNJPC shall be implemented with effect from 01.01.2016.
20.    Insofar as arrears are concerned, it is noticed that the judicial officers were
provided interim relief @ 30% of the basic pay, vide order dated 27.03.2018. Therefore,
the arrears shall be computed with effect from 01.01.2016 and after adjusting the interim
relief already paid, the balance amount shall be paid in stages in the following manner:
I      25% in cash within a period of 3 months;
II     Another 25% to be paid in cash within 3 months thereafter;
III    the balance 50% has to be paid on or before the end of June, 2023.
21.    We are informed that a few States have given revised pay structures to the Judicial
Officers on the basis of the recommendations of the State Pay Commissions. Wherever
the judicial officers have been given benefits under the respective Pay Commissions with
effect from 01.01.2016, those judicial officers shall also be brought within the ambit of
the pay structure, as recommended by SNJPC and the arrears shall be calculated after
adjusting the amounts they have already received with effect from 01.01.2016. In case
the arrears calculated on the basis of this order is less than the amount already
disbursed, no recovery need be effected.
22.    During the course of hearing, it was brought to our notice by the learned Amicus
Curiae that on earlier occasions, though directions were issued by this Court, several
States have not implemented the pay scales, as approved by this Court and there was
undue delay.
23.    Taking into consideration the said fact, we direct the State Governments/Union
Territories to file affidavits of compliance of this Order after each stage as indicated
above, with the first compliance affidavit being filed within a period of three months from
24.    Learned counsel appearing for the petitioner seeks permission to withdraw Writ
Petition (C) No.244 of 2019. Permission as prayed for is granted and it is, accordingly,
dismissed as withdrawn.
25.    The Registry is directed to list Writ Petition(C)Nos.869/2021, 993/2017, 548/2018,
911/2018, 86/2019, 7246/2019, 1542/2019, 1040/2017, 1048/2017 and 1262/2021
26.    So far as rest of the reliefs are concerned, list the matters after some time.
