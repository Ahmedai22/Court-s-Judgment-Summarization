The petitioner is before this Court seeking a direction by
issuance of a writ in the nature of mandamus directing the
respondents to consider the representation submitted by her and
allot a site or house in Doddabelavangala Village, Doddaballapur
Taluk, Bengaluru Rural District and also further sought a direction
to take immediate steps to ensure provision of rehabilitation to the
petitioner and her family members in time bound manner in
accordance with law.
2. Heard Clifton D’Rozario, Smt. Maitreyi Krishnan along with
Smt. Shilpa Prasad, learned counsel appearing for the petitioner,
Sri  B.V.Krishna, learned Additional     Government Advocate for
respondents 1, 2, 4 and 5 and Sri M.S. Devaraj, learned counsel
appearing for respondent No.6.
3. Brief facts that leads the petitioner to this Court in the
subject petition, as borne out from the pleadings, are as follows:-
The   petitioner  is the    wife of  one late  Narasimhaiah.
Narasimhaiah was forced to perform manual scavenging and he was
directed to go inside the manhole in Yehahanka, Bangalore at which
time he died due to asphyxiation because of negligence which was
directly attributable to the 3rd respondent, Bangalore Water Supply
and Sewerage Board. The petitioner and her husband belonged to
Scheduled Caste.     The petitioner, widow of the manual scavenger
who was put to death due to the act of the 3rd respondent gave
representations to rehabilitate her and her family members since
they were all dependent on the income derived from the scavenging
activity  of   her  husband.   Rehabilitation was  not  acceded  to
immediately after the death of the husband, which drove the
petitioner to knock at the doors of this Court in Writ Petition
No.21320 of 2011.
4.    This Court disposed of the petition on 14-09-2011
directing immediate action to be taken for rehabilitation of the
petitioner.   The petitioner again submitted a representation after
the order was passed by this Court and long thereafter, in the year
2012, a site was allotted to the petitioner and the entries
concerning the site were changed in favour of the petitioner. Even
after passage of time, the petitioner could not construct the house
due    to   lack   of   funds.   In   the   year    2022,   the   6th
Panchayat noticing the fact that the petitioner had not constructed
any house despite passage of nine years, after allotment of the site,
took over the site and marked it for the purpose of construction of
Nada Kacheri. This was not made known to the petitioner. Later,
when the petitioner enquired, she was assured that she would be
given   an   alternate   site. The   petitioner   gave  plethora   of
representations seeking re-allotment of site in her favour and the
6th respondent/Panchayat Development Officer indicated to the
Tahsildar regarding such re-allotment. Even then no allotment was
made. It is then the petitioner has again knocked at the doors of
this Court, ironically with the same writ petition number after 11
5. The learned counsel appearing for the petitioner would
contend that rehabilitation of family of the manual scavenger by
prohibiting manual scavenging activity is the mandate of the
statute.    Any deviation from the same would become a penal
offence.    The learned counsel would further emphasize that the
petitioner could not construct the house in a site that was allotted
due to financial constraints and, therefore, she kept the site vacant.
If the site was needed for public purpose, it was the bounden duty
of the State to provide alternate site and minimum finance for
construction of the house, as the petitioner herself belong to lower
strata of the society, doing menial jobs for her survival and
therefore, would submit that suitable direction be given as sought
for.      He would submit that the act of the respondents in
dispossessing a scheduled caste lady would amount to an offence
under the atrocities Act.
6. On the other hand, the learned Additional Government
Advocate     representing  the   State   and   the  learned    counsel
representing     the  Panchayat    would   vehemently     refute   the
submissions to contend that the petitioner did not construct the
house and, therefore, it was taken away from her. No fault can be
found for such an action and would seek dismissal of the petition.
7. I have given my anxious consideration to the submissions
made by the respective learned counsel and have perused the
material on record.
8. Before embarking upon consideration of the case on its
merits, I deem it appropriate to notice the Act i.e., the Prohibition
of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act,
2013 (‘the Act’ for short) and the Rules framed thereunder. Manual
scavenging has been a scrooge ever since construction of drains
took place. The Government in the year 1993 promulgated an Act
to provide for the prohibition of employment as manual scavengers
as well as construction or continuance of dry latrines. The Act was
promulgated to eliminate dehumanizing practice of employment of
manual scavengers and their rehabilitation as well. Though the
rehabilitation was not emphasized to a greater degree, a new
enactment came about in the year 2013 i.e., the Act. The purpose
behind the Act was found in its preamble and it reads as follows:
“An Act to provide for the prohibition of employment as
manual scavengers, rehabilitation of manual scavengers and
their families, and for matters connected therewith or incidental
thereto.
WHEREAS promoting among the citizens fraternity
assuring the dignity of the individual is enshrined as one of the
goals in the Preamble to the Constitution;
AND WHEREAS the right to live with dignity is also implicit
in the Fundamental Rights guaranteed in Part III of the
AND WHEREAS article 46 of the Constitution, inter alia,
provides that the State shall protect the weaker sections, and,
particularly, the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes
from social injustice and all forms of exploitation;
AND WHEREAS the dehumanising practice of manual
scavenging, arising from the continuing existence of insanitary
latrines and a highly iniquitous caste system, still persists in
various parts of the country, and the existing laws have not
proved adequate in eliminating the twin evils of insanitary
latrines and manual scavenging;
AND WHEREAS it is necessary to correct the historical
injustice and indignity suffered by the manual scavengers, and
to rehabilitate them to a life of dignity.”
The preamble records that Article 46 of the Constitution inter alia
provided     that   the   State   shall    protect  weaker   sections   and
particularly, the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes from social
injustice and all forms of exploitation. Quoting Article 46 of the
Constitution of India, the Rehabilitation Act, 2013 is promulgated.
Section 13 of the Act which is germane for the issue reads as
“13. Rehabilitation of persons identified as manual
scavengers by a Municipality.—(1) Any person included in
the final list of manual scavengers published in
pursuance of sub-section (6) of Section 11 or added
thereto in pursuance of sub-section (3) of Section 12,
shall be rehabilitated in the following manner, namely—
(a)   he shall be given, within one month,—
(i)    a photo identity card, containing, inter
alia, details of all members of his family
dependent on him, and
(ii) such initial, one time, cash assistance,
as may be prescribed;
(b)   his children shall be entitled to scholarship as
per the relevant scheme of the Central
Government or the State Government or the
local authorities, as the case may be;
(c)   he shall be allotted a residential plot and
financial assistance for house construction, or
a ready-built house, with financial assistance,
subject to eligibility and willingness of the
manual scavenger, and the provisions of the
relevant scheme of the Central Government or
the State Government or the concerned local
(d)   he, or at least one adult member of his family,
shall be given, subject to eligibility and willingness,
training in a livelihood skill, and shall be paid a
monthly stipend of not less than three thousand
rupees, during the period of such training;
(e)   he, or at least one adult member of his family,
shall be given, subject to eligibility and willingness,
subsidy and concessional loan for taking up an
alternative occupation on a sustainable basis, in
such manner as may be stipulated in the relevant
scheme of the Central Government or the State
Government or the concerned local authority;
(f)   he shall be      provided such other legal and
programmatic      assistance,     as     the    Central
Government or State Government may notify in
this behalf.
(2) The District Magistrate of the district concerned shall
be responsible for rehabilitation of each manual scavenger in
accordance with the provisions of sub-section (1) and the State
Government or the District Magistrate concerned may, in
addition, assign responsibilities in his behalf to officers
subordinate to the District Magistrate and to officers of the
concerned Municipality.”
The implementing authorities are enumerated under Section 18.
Section 18 of the Act reads as follows:
“18. Authorities who may be specified for
implementing provisions of this Act.—The appropriate
Government may confer such powers and impose such duties on
local authority and District Magistrate as may be necessary to
ensure that the provisions of this Act are properly carried out,
and a local authority and the District Magistrate may, specify
the subordinate officers, who shall exercise all or any of the
powers, and perform all or any of the duties, so conferred or
imposed, and the local limits within which such powers or duties
shall be carried out by the officer or officers so specified.”
Section 32 directs that the State Government by notification
designate a State Commission for Safai Karamacharis or a State
Commission for the Scheduled Castes or such other statutory or
other authority within the State. Section 13 which forms fulcrum of
the issue in the lis directs that any person included in the final list
of manual scavengers shall be prohibited from doing such work and
rehabilitated by allotment of a plot, financial assistance for house
construction or a ready built house subject to eligibility and
willingness of such manual scavenger. It is to be implemented by
the Central Government, State Government or the concerned local
authority and there are other slews of rehabilitation directions that
form a mandate of Section 13. It is on the basis of the aforesaid
provisions of law, the case would merit consideration.
9. The petitioner is a woman belonging to Scheduled Caste.
The husband of the petitioner was doing the job of manual
scavenging.    In the year 2008 the Bangalore Water Supply and
Sewerage Board (‘BWSSB’ for short) forces the husband of the
petitioner to go in to the manhole at Yelahanka and on account of
negligence directly attributable to the BWSSB the husband of the
petitioner  dies   due   to  asphyxiation.  After   the  death,   the
petitioner/widow gave plethora of representations for rehabilitation.
This was not considered. The petitioner had knocked at the doors of
this Court in W.P.No.21320 of 2011. A co-ordinate Bench of this
Court disposed of the petition in terms of its order dated
14-09-2011 by passing the following:
5. Insofar as the allotment of a house is
concerned, the learned Government Pleader
on instructions from the 1st respondent,
particularly, the Assistant Commissioner,
submits that a decision is taken to allot a site
measuring 30ft.X40ft. comprised in Sy.No.154
of Doddahejjaji in Doddaballapur Taluk in
favour of the petitioner herein who is the
widow of the deceased.             Therefore, the
grievance made by the petitioner in this
regard      also     does     not    survive     for
6. Insofar as the request made for appointment to a
job in the state government, this Court has already
held in the connected writ petition No.1520/2011
disposed     of     on    08.06.2011     and    also
W.P.No.6225/2011 disposed of on 28.07.2011
regarding the two other claims made by the
similarly placed dependants of the deceased that
such appointment on compassionate ground cannot
be granted. In fact the request for compassionate
appointment itself is held to be baseless.
7. However, an observation is made by the Court
stating that in the light of the facts and
circumstances which disclosed that the
deceased had worked under the contractor
who had undertaken the work for the 2nd
respondent – BWSSB, as and when the 2nd
respondent       notified    posts    for   regular
appointment, petitioner or any of the
dependent children of the petitioner, if they
possess the requisite qualification could apply
in response to the notification for regular
recruitment and in the said process of
recruitment, if all other things are similar, the
family member of the petitioner shall be
provided weightage by the 2nd respondent
while making the appointment.
9.    Accordingly, it is made clear that the
petitioner or her dependent children will be
entitled for similar benefits/weightage as
observed in the aforementioned two writ
petitions. Since an apprehension is expressed
by the petitioner that allotment of house site
might be delayed, I find it just and
appropriate to direct the 1st respondent to put
the petitioner in possession of the house site
as expeditiously as possible, at any rate,
within a period of six weeks from the date of
receipt of a copy of this order.      The writ
petition is accordingly disposed of.”
(Emphasis supplied)
This Court clearly observed that the Government was ready and
willing to give a plot/site to the petitioner and all other benefits
under the Act or under the scheme prevailing then. The petitioner
then represented to the 1st respondent on 04-10-2011 seeking
allotment of a house in her favour. After struggling to get a house,
she was allotted a plot instead of a vacant site on 19-10-2012 by
name of the petitioner was also mentioned in the demand register
in respect of Plot No.2 within the precincts of the Panchayat. After
about 9 years, the petitioner gets to know that her plot has been
taken       away              from         her        and      represents            to      the          6th
respondent/Panchayat. The representation reads as follows:
zÉÆqÀØ¨É¼ÀªÀAUÀ® UÁæªÀÄ¥ÀAZÁ¬ÄÛ
ªÉÄÃ®ÌAqÀ «¼Á¸ÀzÀ°è ªÁ¸ÀªÁVgÀÄªÀ £Á£ÀÄ vÀªÀÄä°è PÉÃ½PÉÆ¼ÀÄîªÀÅzÉÃ£ÉAzÀgÉ £ÁåAiÀÄ®AiÀÄzÀ
¸ÀÜ¼ÀªÀ£ÀÄß vÉÆÃj¸À¨ÉÃPÉAzÀÄ vÀªÀÄä°è ¥ÁæxÀð£É.”
The Panchayat communicates to the Tahsildar that a site or a house
be granted in favour of the petitioner on 24-02-2022.                                                  The
Communication reads as follows:

Nothing comes about. The petitioner then represents through
someone’s     assistance     to  the   Tahsildar   and     the   Panchayat
Development Officer/6th respondent.        The representation reads as
Sub: Non-compliance with the High Court of Karnataka’s
order in W.P.No.21320 of 2011 (GM RES).
I, Nagamma, w/o late Narasimhaiah, aged about 47
years, residing at Doddabelavangala Hobli, Doddaballapur Taluk,
Bengaluru Rural, Karnataka 561 204, am writing to bring to
your notice the failure of the State authorities to comply with
the direction of the Hon’ble High Court of Karnataka in the order
dated 14-09-2011 in W.P.No.21320 of 2011 (GM RES). The said
Writ Petition is filed by me on account of my husband’s death
due to asphyxiation while performing the work of manual
scavenging on 14-11-2008, praying for a direction to the
respondent-State authorities to comply with its promises made
regarding enhanced monetary compensation, house, and a
government job to each of the family members of my husband.
The Hon’ble High Court, through the order dated 14-09-
2022, was pleased dispose of the petition recording the
submission of the Government of Karnataka at para-5 on
instruction s from the Assistant Commissioner, Doddaballapur
division, that a decision had been taken to allot a site measuring
30 ft. x 40 ft. comprised in Sy.No.154 of Doddahejjaji in
Doddaballapur Taluk in favour of me. I was directed that the
State of Karnataka must put me in possession of the house site
as 3expeditiously as possible, at any rate, within a period of 6
weeks from the date of receipt of the copy of the order.
Accordingly, I submitted a letter to the Chief
Secretary, Government of Karnataka dated 4-10-2011
with a copy of the Deputy Commissioner, Doddaballapur,
and      the      Panchayat      Development          Officer    –
Doddabelavangala Grama Panchayat, along with a coy of
the order dated 14-09-2011 in W.P.No.21320 of 2011.
Thus, per the directions of the Hon’ble High Court, I was
to be put in possession of the house site within a period
of 6 weeks from the date of receipt of the order.
Pursuant to the order, I was given a site bearing
site No.42 in Doddabelavangala, for which I duly paid
property tax, the receipts of which reflect my name.
However, the State authorities have unlawfully taken the
allotted site away from me and have informed me that I
would be given an alternative site instead. It is pertinent
to note that the site allotted to me was taken away
without any prior notice, without giving me an
opportunity to object to the same, and without my
knowledge. These actions are in gross contravention of
the order of the Hon’ble High Court and are in direct
violation of the same.
After the death of my husband, we have been
undergoing great suffering as he was the sole earning
member of my family. I have a daughter named Yashoda
whose young children who are in the 5th and 7th standard
are dependent on me and are residing with me. I stay in a
rented house, the rent for which is extremely heavy and
is placing me in great financial distress. I am currently
living in penury, with no means of sustenance or
employment. A copy of my BPL card is enclosed with this
letter. I do not have any stable income and, especially on
account of the pandemic and subsequent lockdowns,
have been greatly prejudiced by the unlawful actions of
the State authorities. I have repeatedly approached the
Tahsildar and Gram Panchayat requesting that the site
allotted to me not be taken away unlawfully, and that the
order of the Hon’ble high Court be complied with but to
no avail. I have currently been removed from the
possession of the site unlawfully.
I have also not been provided rehabilitation as required
under Section 13 of the Prohibition of Employment as Manual
Scavengers and their rehabilitation Act, 2013, including financial
assistance, scholarship to the children, allotment of residential
plot along with financial assistance for house construction or a
ready made house, training in a livelihood skill, concessional
loans to take up an alternative profession and legal and
pragmatic assistance.
I request you to kindly ensure that the site allotted
to me per the Order of the Hon’ble High Court of
Karnataka in Doddabelavangala is given back to me and I
am put in possession of the same, that I am provided
financial assistance for construction of a house and all
other measures of rehabilitation required under the
Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and
their Rehabilitation Act, 2013 and Rules.”
(Emphasis added)
This resulted again in a communication from the Panchayat to the
Tahsildar, nothing happens. It is then the petitioner reaches the
doors of this Court for the second time.           The Tahsildar/5th
respondent files his affidavit contending that he is not responsible
for the loss of plot of the petitioner; it is only the Panchayat
Development Officer of the Doddabelavangala Gram Panchayat who
should answer the issue. The affidavit of the Tahsildar insofar as it
is germane for the lis reads as follows:
“5. The site granted by the Gram Panchayath favouring
the petitioner has not been taken away by the Revenue
Department nor by any order passed by me, the site which is
reserved now for construction of Nada Kacheri has not been
allotted to anyone under the Ashraya Scheme. It is therefore,
for the Grama Panchayath, Doddabelavangala to clarify
as to the location of the Site No.164/42 granted
favouring the petitioner. In that connection, the
Government has already issued an Endorsement dated 8-
12-2022      to   the   petitioner and the Panchayath
Panchayath. Copy of the same is produced herewith.”
(Emphasis added)
Therefore, the Panchayat Development Officer was directed to file
his objections.      The Panchayat Development Officer files his
objections to the effect that the petitioner has no right for a plot as
she has violated the conditions.     The relevant paragraph of the
objections of the Panchayat Development Officer reads as follows:
“3. It is submitted that the petitioner was allotted
with site in 2011-12 only and the petitioner did not put
up construction till June 2022. Therefore, she cannot
claim that the orders have not been complied with. In
fact, the site was in her possession since 2011-12 to June
4. It is submitted that as per the brief facts of the
petition, this respondent has already forwarded the
request of the petitioner earlier and further he has
earmarked the site/place in Doddabelavangala Village for
grant of site to the petitioner. Therefore, the petitioner
cannot     maintain    the   writ   petition   against    this
respondent.”
The reason rendered for snatching away the plot of the petitioner is
that the petitioner though was allotted a site in 2011-12 she did not
put up any construction till June 2022. Therefore, she cannot claim
that the earlier orders have not been complied with. It is indicated
that the site was in her possession from 2011-12 to June 2022.
Therefore, possession of the petitioner is accepted by both the
State and the Authorities. Taking away of the site is also accepted
as the objections would depict that possession was with the
petitioner up to June 2022. It is then the petitioner had submitted
plethora of representations.
10. This Court while entertaining the petition has passed
several orders directing concerned authorities to show cause as to
why a site that was granted on the death of the husband of the
petitioner was taken away contrary to law.     After seeking several
adjournments, the 5th respondent has identified a plot and restored
possession to the petitioner within 4 days as the last of the
adjournments was granted on 02-02-2023 and the matter was
directed to be listed on 07-02-2023. Time was taken up to 09-02-
2023 to set the wrong, right. In one week’s time the wrong was set
right, petitioner was restored possession of a property which
contains a house. This could have been done without the petitioner
knocking at the doors of this Court. If it could be done within one
week on this Court questioning the action, the action could have
been taken without such questioning by this Court. Therefore, it is
the lack of will and display of apathy towards poor citizens by the
powers that be.
11. Though the petitioner has been restored possession, the
issue does not stop at that, the petitioner would be entitled to
financial assistance and also costs of the litigation, as the State has
driven a Scheduled Caste lady to knock at the doors of this Court
for the second time on their sheer attitude of demonstrating power
over the under powered. It is because the petitioner knocked at the
doors of this Court she was restored with possession of plot despite
vehement objections put up by the 6th respondent as quoted supra
that the petition should be dismissed contending that she has no
12. It is not enough under the Act, if a plot is allotted in
furtherance of a rehabilitation in terms of 13(1)(c) of the Act to a
manual scavenger. Grant of financial assistance is imperative and
there are several other benefits that any manual scavenger who is
prohibited from that work gets in terms of the Act. The situation in
the case at hand is worse. The husband of the petitioner who was
a manual scavenger dies due to manual scavenging, an act which
was clearly prohibited on the date on which the husband of the
petitioner died.     Therefore, it was the responsibility of the
respondents not only to have allotted the plot, but to have granted
financial assistance. Section 13 supra mandates such financial
assistance to persons who have been rehabilitated on prohibiting
manual scavenging and to the family of such manual scavenger
who dies during such dehumanizing job.
13.  Therefore, for the act of the 6th respondent in snatching
away the plot of the petitioner, a poor widow of a manual
scavenger     and    driving    her    to    unnecessary    litigation,
notwithstanding the fact that she has now been restored possession
of a plot which has a house as well, I deem it appropriate to grant
the petitioner costs which is assessed at `50,000/- to be paid jointly
and severally by respondents 2, 4 and 6 and litigation expenses for
such illegal action at `50,000/- to be paid exclusively by the 6th
respondent/Panchayat, as it is the act of the said Panchayat that
took away the right of the petitioner over the property that had
been granted to her by the State,      pursuant to the order passed by
14. The petitioner shall also be granted all such financial
assistance and benefits that would flow from Section 13 of the Act.
The respondents/State, particularly 2nd and 4th respondents, shall
oversee that all the benefits under the Act qua Section 13 are
conferred upon the petitioner and not drive her to another round of
litigation. Ergo, it is high time that “the haves stop despoiling
the rights of have-nots; the haves, I mean, those who have
15. For the aforesaid reasons, I pass the following:
(i)      Writ Petition is allowed with cost of `50,000/- to be
paid to the petitioner by respondents 2, 4 and 6
jointly and severally.
(ii)     The possession of the petitioner that is granted
during the pendency of the petition shall not be
disturbed.
(iii)    Financial assistance as is available under Section 13
of the Act shall be conferred upon the petitioner by
respondents 2, 4 and 6 except the ones that have
been negatived in Writ Petition No.21320 of 2010.
(iv) The petitioner shall also be entitled to cost of the
litigation assessed at Rs.50,000/- to be paid
exclusively by the 6th respondent/Panchayath.
(v)  The respondents shall comply with the directions in
clause Nos.(i) and (iv) with regard to payment of
costs and litigation expenses within two weeks from
the date of receipt of the copy of this order.
(vi) The respondents shall file a compliance report qua
direction in clause Nos.(i) and (iv) within the next
four weeks.
