2.     The petitioner is A-5 in Crime No.190 of 2021 of Eluru
3.     A case under Sections 420, 471, 468 read with Section 34
of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 and Section 8(c) read with
Section 20(b)(ii)(C) of the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic
Substances Act, 1985 (for short ‘NDPS’ Act) was registered
against him along with other accused in the above crime.
4.     Briefly stated, it is the case of the prosecution that on
15.06.2021 when the petitioner herein who was A-5, and A-4
were transporting 200 KGs of ganja in two Auto Rickshaws at
the instance of A-1 to A-3 that they were apprehended by the

KGs of ganja was found in one Auto Rickshaw in which the
petitioner was travelling an another 100 KGs of ganja was found
in another Auto Rickshaw in which A-4 was travelling.
Therefore, it is stated that the petitioner herein along with other
accused has committed the aforesaid offence.
5.     Heard learned counsel for the petitioner and learned
Additional Public Prosecutor for the State.
6.     Learned counsel for the petitioner would submit that the
petitioner was arrested on 14.06.2021 and the stipulated period
of 180 days for completion of investigation stood expired by
11.12.2021 and the investigation is not completed within the
said period and charge sheet is not filed by the prosecution
within the statutory period of time. Therefore, the petitioner has
filed an application under Section 167(2) Cr.P.C for grant of
default bail and in the meanwhile, prosecution has filed an
application under Section 36A(4) of the NDPS Act for extension
of period of investigation and the lower Court instead of
disposing the said petition filed under Section 167(2) Cr.P.C on
the same day, waited till the disposal of the petition for
extension of period of investigation, thereafter allowed the said
petition and thereafter dismissed the petition filed by the
petitioner for default bail. He would submit that the impugned
order of the learned Magistrate is erroneous and unsustainable
under law and thereby prayed for grant of bail to the petitioner.
7.     Learned Additional Public Prosecutor opposed the criminal
petition. He would submit that even before expiry of 180 days of
period of time for completion of investigation, the prosecution
has filed petition for extension of period for completion of
investigation well within the time i.e. on 22.11.2021 itself and
the said petition was allowed extending the period of time for
completion of investigation for another 180 days and as such,
the petitioner is not entitled for default bail under Section 167(2)
Cr.P.C. He would further submit that the contraband involved in
this case is 200 KGs of ganja and 100 KGs of ganja was found
in possession of the petitioner herein and it is a commercial
quantity and the bar under Section 37 of the NDPS Act applies
to the present facts of the case and as investigation is not
completed, he would pray for dismissal of the petition.
8.     Perused the record.
9.     The facts of the case show that the petitioner along with
A-4 was apprehended on 14.06.2021 while they were illegally
transporting 200 KGs of ganja in two Auto Rickshaws. The
petitioner was found to be travelling in one Auto Rickshaw and
100 KGs of ganja was found in his possession and the police
seized the said contraband from his possession. The total ganja
that is involved in this case is 200 KGs of ganja and the ganja
that was found in possession of the petitioner is 100 KGs of
ganja which is a commercial quantity. Therefore, the bar
contained in Section 37 of the NDPS Act applies to the present
facts of the case. There is absolutely nothing to indicate on
record that the petitioner is not guilty of committing the said
offence. On the other hand, as the petitioner was found to be in
illegal possession of 100 KGs of ganja and has been transporting
the same in an Auto Rickshaw and at that time he apprehended,
the accusation made against the petitioner is prima facie well
10.    As regards the contention raised by learned counsel for
the petitioner regarding entitlement of the petitioner for grant of
default bail under Section 167(2) Cr.P.C is concerned, the record
reveals that the petitioner was arrested on 14.06.2021. As per
the provisions of the NDPS Act, the investigation has to be
completed within 180 days from the date of arrest of the
accused. The said period would expire by 11.12.2021. However,
the record reveals that the prosecution has filed an application
for extension of period for completion of investigation under
Section 36A(4) of the NDPS Act well in advance before expiry of
180 days i.e. on 22.11.2021. The said petition was allowed by
the Court and the period of time for completion of investigation
was extended by another 180 days. Therefore, considering the
fact that the time for completion of investigation was extended
under Section 36A(4) of the NDPS Act, the lower Court has
rightly dismissed the petition filed by the petitioner for grant of
default bail under Section 167(2) Cr.P.C.
11.     Therefore, in the said facts and circumstances of the case
and in view of the bar contained in Section 37 of the NDPS Act
and as the investigation in this case is still pending and huge
quantity of ganja was found to be in illegal possession of the
petitioner, this Court is of the considered view that the
petitioner is not entitled to bail at this stage. The judgment
relied upon by learned counsel for the petitioner in case of Md.
Enamul Haque vs. Central Bureau of Investigation 1 is not
applicable to the present facts of the case. That is the case
where investigation was completed and charge sheet was filed.
Therefore, the Apex Court held that there are no reasons for his
further incarceration in the said facts and circumstances of the
case. In the instant case, investigation is not completed and
charge sheet is not filed. Therefore, the petitioner is not entitled
to bail in the present case for the reasons discussed supra.
12.   Resultantly, the Criminal Petition is dismissed.
