1]     This writ petition has been filed by the petitioners under
Article 226/227 of the Constitution of India seeking the following
“1. Allow the present Petition.
2. Pass an appropriate writ, order or directions in the
nature of mandamus directing the Respondents to
forthwith make payment of an amount of
Rs.1,30,57,640/- as compensation for the subject
Bungalow, situated 153, 154, 154-A, Mall Road,
Mhow, District Indore along with interest @12% per
annum from the date of compulsory resumption i.e.,
01.04.2009, in terms of the Award dated 30/11/2011,
within a period of 4 (four) weeks from the date of final
judgement passed by this Hon’ble Court.
3. Direct the Respondents to pay Rs.10,00,000/- (Rupees
ten lakhs only) to the Petitioners for causing a delay in
payment of compensation.
4. Award the cost of the present Petition to the Petitioner.
5. Pass any other order, writ or direction that this Hon’ble
Court may deem fit and proper in the facts and
circumstances of the present case.”
2]     The grievance of the petitioners is of non-execution of the
arbitration award passed by the Competent Arbitration Committee
dated 30/11/2011, this is despite being an order passed by this Court
on 02/03/2020 in WP No.4117/2020, wherein the executing Court
was directed to decide the execution case within four months’ time
without granting unnecessary adjournments to the respondents.
3]     Learned counsel for the petitioners has submitted that even
after passing of the aforesaid order, and despite giving numerous
undertakings by the respondents before the executing Court for
compliance of the award, no action has been taken by the executing
Court nor the respondents themselves and the petitioners are
running from pillar to post to get the compensation in respect of
their bungalow which was resumed by the Union of India (Defence
Department) for their own purpose. Thus, it is submitted that the
respondents be directed to pay the amount expeditiously. Reliance
is also placed by the counsel for the petitioners upon an order
passed by the coordinate Bench of this Court presided over by Shri
Justice A.M. Sapre (as his Lordship then was), in WP No.4186/2005
dated 07/09/2006, in an identical matter.
4]     A reply to the petition has also been filed and it is submitted
that the award which is sought to be executed from the lower Court
is not actually an award in terms of the Arbitration Act, 1996
(hereinafter referred to as the Arbitration Act) in fact it is only a
recommendation given to the Government of India which has
already been rejected by the Ministry of Defence vide its letter
dated 08/03/2022, a copy of the order is also placed on record.
5]     Learned counsel appearing for the respondents have
submitted that the aforesaid recommendation made by the
Arbitration Committee were not in consonance with the principles
of procedures of the Ministry of Defence dated 18/12/2009, and the
appendix there to, hence, it could not be sustained.
6]      Shri Sapan Kumar, the Defence Estate Officer, Mhow
(hereinafter D.E.O.) present in the Court has submitted that he has
given various undertakings before the Court and the letters issued
by him to the Principal Director of Ministry of Defence have also
been filed on record but he has sent those letters in his capacity as
DEO only and he is also bound by the orders issued to him from his
7]      Ms. Bhawna Singh, the Director General Commandment,
Lucknow also present in the Court has also submitted that the
award itself is not actually an award but only a recommendation
and cannot be executed in the Trial Court. Hence, their inability to
satisfy the same may be excused and the petition be dismissed.
8]      Heard learned counsel for the parties and perused the record.
9]      From the record, it is found that it is not in dispute that the
execution case No.139/2013 filed by the petitioners is pending in
the Court at Mhow for execution of the award dated 30/11/2011.
The operative para of the award reads as under:-

10]     It is true that the Arbitration Committee has used the word
“Anushansha”         the   English       translation     of    which     means
‘recommendation’ but no such document has been placed on record
by the respondents to submit that such recommendation would not
be binding on the respondents, however, the respondents have
placed on record the Letter/document dated 18/12/2009, which
refers to appointment of Arbitration Committee with respect to
bungalow No.153, 154 and 154-A (GLR SY. No.478 and 479), Mall
Road, Mhow Cantt. For ready reference, the relevant paras of the
same read as under:-
“9.      The Chairman of the Arbitration Committee will
ascertain the name of the nominee(s) of the legal heirs of the
HOR and take necessary action for convening the Arbitration
10.      The legal heirs of the HOR should give an
undertaking before convening of the Arbitration Committee
to the effect that the land appurtenant to and underneath the
building belongs to the Government and they are not entitled
to any compensation from the Govt. on account of land.
11.      The Arbitration Committee will follow the
procedures ad laid down in the Appendix attached with this
letter.
12.      The terms of reference of the Committee appointed
are confined strictly to determine the value of the authorized
constructions on the land after hearing the legal heirs of the
HOR and the G.E./C.W.E. In no case the Committee shall
entertain any dispute as to claim to the title of land.
13.      The Arbitration Committee is required to decide the
compensation payable within six months of the formation of
the Arbitration Committee.”
11]    Para 5 of the appendix to this letter provide for procedure to
be followed by the Arbitration Committee, which reads as under:-
“5. The Committee will record its decision in sufficient
detail stating that the cases of the parties, issues arising
for examination, summarising the evidence and pleading
and giving the findings with brief reasons therefore. The
points of dispute can only be in relation to facts and not
on principles or the basis of valuation. The Committee in
no case will entertain any dispute as to the claim to title to
the land. The findings of the Committee will as far as
possible, be by consensus and in its absence by majority
view of the members present. The findings of the
Committee should be filed with the Principal Director,
Defence Estates, Command for obtaining the order of the
Govt. of India.”
12]    It is also found that being aggrieved by the inaction on the
part of the respondents to satisfy the aforesaid award, the petitioners
herein had also filed WP No.4117/2020 which came to be disposed
of by this Court on 02/03/2020, in the following manner:-
“Shri Abhinav Malhotra, learned counsel for the
petitioners.
Ms. Ishita Agrawal, learned counsel for the
respondents.
Petitioners before this Court have filed this present
petition being aggrieved by non-payment of compensation by
respondents in terms of the arbitral award dated 30.11.2011.
The facts of the case reveal that the Union of India
has resumed the bungalows and the land attached to it in
contonment area situated at Mall Road, Mhow, District
Indore but, they have not been paid compensation to the
petitioners. Petitioners came up before this Court by filing
writ petitions. A common order was passed in W.P.Nos. 7605
& 7606 of 2009 on 22/10/2009 by this Court directing the
competent authority to decide the claim of the petitioners for
compensation within six months. It was also observed that in
case the competent authority realises that the claim of the
petitioners has to be determined by some other authority /
arbitrator, then an arbitrator shall be appointed in the matter.
An arbitrator was appointed. The arbitrator has passed an
award on 30/11/2011. The petitioners have been held entitled
for grant of compensation to the tune of Rs.1,30,57,640/-
(Rupees one crore thirty lakhs fifty seven thousand and six
hundred only).
It is the case of the petitioners that the matter is
pending since the year 2011 and the Union of India is
avoiding payment of compensation to them on one pretext or
the other. Therefore, execution case was filed. The execution
case is pending for the last nine years and before the
executing Court, time is being sought by the Union of India
for compliance in the matter.
Learned counsel for the respondents argued that the
matter has been reported to the higher authorities for sanction
of the amount. As the sanction has not been received so far,
time is being sought in the matter of payment of
compensation to the petitioners.
Heard learned counsel for the parties at length and
perused the record.
In the considered opinion of this Court, the matter is
pending before the executing Court for getting the award
executed since the year 2011.
Resultantly, this petition is disposed of with a
direction to the executing Court to decide the pending
execution case within a period of 04 (four) months from the
date of receipt of certified copy of this order. It is made clear
that the executing Court shall not grant unnecessary
adjournments. In case, either side seeks adjournment, the
reasons for the same be recorded in writing by the executing
Accordingly, writ petition stands disposed of.”
(emphasis supplied)
13]     So far as the various undertakings given by the Estate Officer
in the executing Court are concerned, it would suffice to refer to the
letter dated 15/09/2015 given in the aforesaid undertaking by the
Estate Officer. The relevant paragraph of which reads as under:-
“g)      Now, the Executing Court has passed attachment
order of Govt property on 07.09.2015 in the subject case for
not depositing awarded amount Rs.1,30,57,640.00 plus
interest @12% as per award (Total: Rs.2,29,85,045/-). (Copy
of Hon. ADJ Court Order dated 07.09.2015 is enclosed
herewith as Annexure-C.
h)       The Hon. ADJ Court Mhow has ordered payment as
per Adhinirnay/recommendations of the Arbitration
Amount of compensation as per Arbitration 1,30,57,640.00
committee recommendations dated 30.11.2011
+   Interest @      12%    from   01.04.2009   to 1,03,20,186.27
Total payable                                 2,33,77,826.27
Calculation sheet is also attached separately as (Annexure-D).
i)      In view of the above, Govt. sanction may kindly be
sought and communicated to this office regarding payment of
Rs.2,33,77,826.00 (Rupees two cror thirty three lakh seventy
seven thousand and eight hundred twenty six only) to the ex-
resumptee owners as per recommendations of the Arbitration
Committee and as ordered by the Executing Court. In case
otherwise, this office may be suitably directed to take
necessary action in this matter.
j)      Next date for hearing in the Executing Court is
22.09.2015 hence kindly accord priority to avoid loss of the
Govt.’s position before the Hon. Court.
(Dte. DE case file No24507/LC-3/VOL-III refers)”
(emphasis supplied)
14]    So far as the order dated 08/03/2022 is concerned, whereby
of the award dated 30/11/2011 has been rejected, apparently it has
been passed after an enormous delay of 10 years, i.e., the period,
the Union of India took to come out of its slumber. Although the
decision rendered by this Court (Sapre,J.) in WP No.4186/2005
dated 07/09/2006 is sought to be distinguished by the respondents
but it would be germane to refer to the said order to demonstrate
identical nature of the case. The same reads as under:-
“By fling this writ under Article 226/227 of the Constitution
of India, the petitioners seek enforcement of an award, passed
by Arbitration Committee, constituted by respondent no.2 for
determining the compensation payable to the petitioners for
their house, bearing No.14, Situated at Dr. Ambedkar Nagar,
2.       Facts of the case are not in dispute. In other words, it
is not in dispute that petitioner was the owner fo Bungalow
No. 14, situated at Dr. Ambedkar Nagar (Mhow), District-
Indore. It is also not in dispute that the said Bungalow was
resumed by Union of India (Defence Department) for their
own purpose. It is also not in dispute that Government of
India by their communication No. 701/708/R &D/L & O/86-
1436/D (lands), dated 2.12.1986 constituted an arbitration
Committee for determining the compensation payable to the
petitioner in respect of the said Bungalow (structure). It is also
not in dispute that pursuant to the constitution of the
committee, the said committee by their award dated 3.01.2005
(Annexure P-6), determined the compensation amounting to
Rs. 15,05,182/- payable to the petitioner alongwith the interest
payable the rate of 9 % for the first year and thereafter 15%
p.a. after the expiry of one year, as is clear from mere perusal
of the award. It is also not in dispute that the respondents have
not so far paid this amount determined by the committee in
terms of the award and hence, the petitioners are in writ
Notice of this petition was issued to the respondents. They are
served and duly represented.
3.       Heard Shri BM Masani, learned counsel for the
petitioners and Shri Vinay Zelawat, learned Assistant Solicitor
General of India for the respondents.
4.       Having heard learned counsel for the parties, having
perused the record of the case and taking note of undisputed
facts narrated supra, I am inclined to allow the writ.
5.       In my considered view, in the light of the undisputed
facts which are taken note of supra, a case for issuance of writ
of mandamus without going into much details of the legal
quibbling is made out in favour of the petitioners and against
the respondents. When Government of India has deprived of a
citizen from his property by taking recourse to the provisions
of law relating to resumption of his property then in the event,
it is the duty of the Government of India to ensure that
adequate compensation is paid to the citizen. In this
connection, I can not possibly overlook the subtle
observations of a great Judge MC Chagla made in the case of
firm Sita Ram Kalu Ram Vs. Dominion of India. AIP 1954
Bombay 50 which in later years received the approval from
Apex Court when His Lordship observed :-
“When the State deals will a citizen it should
not ordinarily rely on technicalities, and if the
State is satisfied that the case of the citizen is a
just one, even though legal defences may be
open to it, it must act, as an honest person.”
The aforesaid observations can be applied to the undisputed
facts of this case.
6.       As observed supra, it is not in dispute that
respondents have not yet paid the due compensation
determined by their Arbitration Committee by an award, dated
3.01.2005, referred supra to the petitioners. It is also not in
dispute that respondents have not questioned the legality and
validity of the said award in any court of law till date. Under
these circumstances, this award is binding upon them, because
it is the respondents, who constituted the committee and got
the determination done obviously with a view to pay the same
to the petitioners.
7.       Accordingly and in view of the aforesaid discussion,
which alone is sufficient, the petitioner succeeds and is hereby
allowed. As rightly submitted by learned Assistant Solicitor
General on behalf of the Government of India that a
reasonable time should be fixed to enable the Government of
India to release the amount of compensation awarded to the
petitioners in terms of the award dated 3.01.2005, I accept this
submission and direct the respondents to pay the awarded
amount of compensation to the petitioners in terms of the
award, dated 3.01.2005 preferably within a period of six
months as an outer limit from the date of this order.”
(emphasis supplied)
15]    On perusal of the aforesaid order it is apparent that on earlier
occasion also the award passed by the Arbitration Committee has
been directed to be complied with by this court. In such facts and
circumstances of the case, this Court is of the considered opinion
that merely if the award dated 30/11/2011 has been rejected or set
aside by the respondents, on 08/03/2022 i.e., after 10 years, and
taking note of the order dated 02/03/2020 passed by this Court in
WP No.4117/2020, this Court has no hesitation to come to a
conclusion that the respondents have not only failed in their duties
to redress the grievance of senior citizens 74 years and 66 years old
respectively, but have also failed to perform their duties with due
16]    It is also found the award dated 30/11/2011, passed by the
Arbitration Committee has not been challenged by them in any
court of law and even the execution proceedings have never been
challenged on the ground that there is no award under the
Arbitration Act and it was only a recommendation. What this court
sees is only Tareekh pe Tareekh sought by the UOI to satisfy the
award, especially when the case is pending since 01/04/2009 and it
was specifically directed by this court vide order dated 02.03.2020
in W.P.No.4117/2020, to dispose of           the proceedings within 4
months’ time in the following terms :-
“Resultantly, this petition is disposed of with a direction to
the executing Court to decide the pending execution case
within a period of 04 (four) months from the date of receipt
of certified copy of this order. It is made clear that the
executing Court shall not grant unnecessary adjournments. In
case, either side seeks adjournment, the reasons for the same
be recorded in writing by the executing Court.”
17]    It has already been more than two years since the aforesaid
order was passed by this court which is also demonstrative of the
failure on the part of the executing court to exercise the powers
vested in it by law despite being armed with the aforesaid order of
this court, which also has the effect of demeaning its own authority.
So far as the order dated 08/03/2022 passed by the respondents
rejecting the award passed by the Arbitration Committee on
30/11/2011 is concerned, in the considered opinion of this court
it is only an eye wash and appears to have been passed only
with a view to wriggle out of this unpleasant situation and is of
no help to the respondent at this juncture of the lis. It is also
beyond the faculties of this court as to why, after acquiring the
property of a citizen in the year 2009, a democratic Government
would shy away from making the payment and would not part
with a single penny even in the year 2022.
18]    Resultantly, in view of the aforesaid discussion, the petitioner
deserves to be and is hereby allowed. As a reasonable time also
requires to be fixed to enable the Government of India to release the
amount of compensation awarded to the petitioners in terms of the
award dated 30/11/2011, this court deems it proper to directs the
respondents to pay the awarded amount of compensation to the
petitioners in terms of the award dated 30/11/2011, within a period
of six months as an outer limit from the date of this order.
C.c. as per rules.
