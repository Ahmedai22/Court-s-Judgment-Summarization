“When the State or its agents fear the people there is
LIBERTY; when the people fear the State or its agents, there
The petitioner, a young advocate laments that his
personal    liberty   is torn    into  smithereens      by   a   few,
megalomaniac and mayhem happy, police personnel in an
act of outrage of his human rights.
The petitioner, a young boy of 23 years, an Advocate, too
young to the bar, having enrolled on 02-11-2022 to the Karnataka
State Bar Council claims to be practicing in all Courts of the city at
Mangaluru. The narration of the story is that, the petitioner owns
certain agricultural property, it abuts an agricultural property of
Mrs. Bhavani and K.Vasantha Gowda, her husband. It is averred
that K.Vasantha Gowda started obstructing the petitioner of his
right to use the road leading to his agricultural property and was
attempting to erect a permanent gate with an intention to prevent
the petitioner and his family from making use of the road that led
to his agricultural property.     This constrains the petitioner to
approach the Court of the Principal Civil Judge and JMFC, Bantwal in
O.S.No.391 of 2022. The Court entertaining the suit grants
temporary injunction against K.Vasantha Gowda, in terms of its
order dated 01-12-2022.      The petitioner after securing certified
copy of the temporary injunction order communicates it to the Sub-
Inspector of Police, Punjalakatte Police Station on 02-12-2022 to
take action to protect his property, in terms of the interim order so
granted by the civil Court. It is alleged that there was no action
taken by the Police.
3. It transpires that the Police closed the complaint against
K. Vasantha Gowda holding it to be a land dispute on 02-12-2022,
on the same day. Immediately after closure of the said complaint,
Mrs. Bhavani registers a complaint against the petitioner at 8.15
p.m. on 02-12-2022. The crime is registered against the petitioner
on the complaint made by Mrs. Bhavani for offences punishable
under Sections 447 and 379 of the IPC. Therefore, Mrs. Bhavani is
the complainant.     Even before the FIR could be registered on her
complaint, it is alleged that on 02.12.2022 the 4th respondent/Sub-
Inspector of Police enters the house of the petitioner at 8.00 p.m.
and in spite of resistance of the mother of the petitioner, the Police
caught hold of the neck of the petitioner, drag him, boot him and
take him to the Police Station and later register a FIR against the
petitioner at 8.15 p.m., on the complaint of Mrs. Bhavani,
W/o.K. Vasantha Gowda. The incident narrated in the complaint is
that the petitioner has attempted to take away the gate that Mrs.
Bhavani wanted to erect.      Therefore, the offences under Sections
447 and 379 of the IPC were laid against the petitioner in Crime
No.94 of 2022. It is the allegation that petitioner’s personal liberty
was taken away completely contrary to law.
4. After the arrest, the petitioner applies for interim bail
before the concerned Court. The Court records the ill-treatment
meted out during arrest of the petitioner by the 4th respondent and
assault on the petitioner during the arrest in his house and also
observed that intimation to be sent to higher authorities to take
action against the Police Officer for violation of personal liberty of
the petitioner and grants interim bail.   Immediately on release of
the petitioner on interim bail, he files a complaint before the
Punjalakatte Police Station against the 4th respondent and other
officers who have manhandled him narrating entire circumstances.
Though the complaint was filed before the Police on 09-12-2022,
the crime was not registered.    This led the petitioner to knock at
the doors of this Court in the subject petition. This Court, in terms
of its order dated 13-12-2022, directed the learned Additional
Government Advocate to seek instructions as to what has become
of the complaint registered by the petitioner against the 4th
respondent and place investigation papers on record.      Even then,
the FIR on the complaint of the petitioner was not registered. The
matter was listed on 04-01-2023. The State sought a day’s time to
seek instructions.  It is then on the evening of 04-01-2023 the
crime comes to be registered against the 4th respondent and others
who were involved in the incident of alleged assault against the
petitioner. The afore-narrated forms the skeleton of the case at
5. Heard Sri P.P.Hegde, learned senior counsel appearing for
the   petitioner  and    Sri  Vinod   Kumar.M.,    learned   Additional
Government Advocate representing the respondents.
6. The learned senior counsel Sri P.P.Hegde, appearing for the
petitioner would with vehemence urge the following contentions:
a.     The alleged complaint against the petitioner was for offences
punishable under Sections 379 and 447 of the IPC, both of
which are not punishable with imprisonment beyond 3 years.
Therefore, the arrest of the petitioner is contrary to law and
the guidelines laid down by the Apex Court in the case of
ARNESH KUMAR v. STATE OF BIHAR – (2014) 8 SCC
b.     In terms of the guidelines so laid down in the case of
ARNESH      KUMAR,     if  the  allegations   involve  offences
punishable with less than 7 years of imprisonment, arrest at
the outset except in exceptional cases, is not warranted.     A
notice under Section 41A of the Cr.P.C. is to be issued and
then arrest if necessary;
c. It is his emphatic submission that the petitioner was dragged
from the house without allowing him to even wear his shirt as
he was in his vest, dragged into the jeep. The mother who
objected was pushed and the petitioner beaten throughout.
Taking away of the liberty of the petitioner was without even
a warrant of arrest, as the crime was yet to be registered;
d. The petitioner in the police station was threatened, booted
and made to write a confession statement that he has himself
stolen the gate and on false pretext had registered the suit
against Mrs.Bhavani;
e. Statement of the petitioner was recorded in the hospital when
he was in an injured state, but no crime was registered
against the 4th respondent or any other person;
f. The complaint registered by the petitioner after securing
interim    bail remained   a   complaint,  as  no  crime    was
g. For all the aforesaid acts of the police, the petitioner is
entitled to be compensated from the hands of the State and a
direction for stringent action against the 4th respondent and
other involved.
7. On the other hand, the learned Additional Government
Advocate representing all the respondents would seek to put up
vehement defense by the following submissions:
a.   The police have only performed their duty, as Hoysala police
had been given a call at 6.15 p.m. by Mrs.Bhavani that there
was some altercations in the property between the petitioner
and the said complainant and therefore, the police had only
b.   On certain occasions, though exceptional, arrest can be made
by the police. This was one such exception;
c.   He would submit that the beating of the petitioner is only
imaginary, nothing of that sort has happened;
d.   Petitioner has himself given a statement that he is guilty of
e.   He would submit since the crime is now registered, apart from
departmental enquiry, no further action need be taken
against the 4th respondent or others at the hands of this
Court. He would seek dismissal of the petition.
8. I have given my anxious consideration to the submissions
made by the respective learned counsel, perused the material on
record and the investigation papers placed before the Court.
9. Though the facts are briefly narrated hereinabove, they
would require iteration in a little more detail. A young boy, aged 23
years, a young Advocate too, has a problem with his neighbour,
nothing concerning his profession.       The petitioner claims to be
owning    certain  agricultural   property.    One   Mrs.Bhavani  and
Sri.K.Vasantha Gowda, her husband also own an agricultural
property.   The properties abut each other.       These neighbours of
such agricultural properties have a dispute with regard to the entry
to their properties, the pathway. The allegation of the petitioner is
that the neighbour is wanting to put up a gate which permanently
blocks the way for the petitioner to enter his property.      Despite
requests, it is the claim of the petitioner that the neighbour did not
10. On the aforesaid grievance of his entry to the agricultural
land being blocked, the petitioner knocks at the doors of the
jurisdictional Civil Court in O.S.No.391 of 2022 seeking relief of
permanent injunction against K. Vasantha Gowda. The civil Court
grants an ex-parte temporary injunction restraining the defendant
and his men from interfering with the use of road by the petitioner
to reach his land. The next date of hearing was on 04-01-2023. The
order of temporary injunction reads as follows:
“Issue ex-parte temporary injunction restraining the defendant or
his men, servants or anybody claiming through them and on their
behalf restraining them from blocking the roadway which proceeds
from Kakkeadav Vagga road to Devasya Mudur mud road cunning
in the B Schedule to reach plaint A schedule land till next date of
hearing. Plaintiff to comply with O 39 R 3 of CPC on compliance.
Issue TI order and issue notice on IA No.II to the defendant and
suit summons to the defendant.
On the strength of temporary injunction granted in the suit filed for
permanent injunction, the petitioner seeks to register a complaint
against K.Vasantha Gowda. The complaint reads as follows:

The petitioner brings it to the notice of Punjalakatte Police Station
that civil Court has granted temporary injunction but K.Vasantha
Gowda         is       attempting              to        interfere             with        the        possession
notwithstanding the order of temporary injunction being brought to
his notice on the very day i.e., 02.12.2022. The Police enquire and
close the complaint, on the ground it is a land dispute between the
two. Immediately after closure of the complaint of the petitioner,
Mrs. Bhavani, wife of K.Vasantha Gowda, the neighbour, on the
very day i.e., 02-12-2012 seeks to register allegations against the
petitioner.    It is  the  submission   of  the  learned  Additional
Government Advocate, on instructions, that Hoysala police were
informed about some altercation between the petitioner and the
neighbour.    The learned Additional Government Advocate would
further submit that the Hoysala police had to go to the spot, but did
not find anything and did not enquire with anybody. The records,
reveal that at 8.00 p.m., the 4th respondent and his cohorts barge
into the house of the petitioner, drag him out of the house and put
him into the jeep. The allegation is that the petitioner was beaten
inside the jeep, his mother was pushed when she wanted to object
the petitioner being taken away by the police.    The police neither
had a warrant of arrest nor an FIR against the petitioner.       The
petitioner was brought to the police station and a crime comes to
be registered on the complaint of Mrs.Bhavani, W/o K.Vasantha
Gowda at 8.15 p.m., 15 months after the incident. The complaint
so registered by Mrs.Bhavani reads as follows:

A perusal at the complaint would indicate the allegation
against the petitioner is of taking away the gate that was installed
in the property of the complainant which was also the pathway to
the property of the petitioner. The complainant narrates that due
to the act of the petitioner, she has suffered a loss of Rs.30,000/-,
which is the cost of the gate. Therefore, a crime in Crime No.94 of
2022 is registered for offences punishable under Section 379 and
447 of the IPC i.e., for criminal trespass and theft.
11. The petitioner was produced before the Magistrate at 5.15
p.m. on the next date i.e., 03.12.2022, in connection with a crime
that was registered against the petitioner in Crime No.94 of 2022.
The learned Magistrate grants interim bail to the petitioner on
03-12-2022. The order granting interim bail, records the factum of
assault by the police on the petitioner and directs the matter to be
referred to the higher authorities for appropriate action against the
4th respondent. The order granting interim bail reads as follows:
“Accused by name Kuldeep, aged about 23 years, S/o
Chandrashekar Shetty, R/at Baramelu House., Puttila Village and
Post, Belthangady Taluk is produced before me through PC 2512
and PC 2480 of Punjalkatte Police Station at 5.15 p.m. in the open
Court on 3-12-2022 and I.O. also filed remand application, arrest

police pulled him, arrested, brought to the station. Further the
accused has complained against he police about ill-treatment
during his arrest. According to him Mr. Suthesh, PSI of Punjalkatte

followed the guidelines of Hon’ble Supreme Court at the time of
arrest of the accused, that too for the offence punishable under
Section 447 and 379 of IPC which are punishable up to 3 years.
Issue intimation to his higher authority to take

any offence as alleged by the police. He is permanent
resident of Puthila Village of Belthangady Taluk. He has just
enrolled at Karnataka Advocate’s Welfare Fund Trust,
Bangalore on 2-11-2022. He is law abiding citizen. The
accused and complainant had civil dispute. In that aspect
the accused filed an original suit before Civil Judge at
Bantwala as per O.S.No.291 of 2022 not to block the road
way and Court had granted the ex-parte injunction against
the complainant. In the above case the police were
completed the Mahazar etc., the offence is not punishable
with death or life imprisonment. The accused undertakes to
obey any of the conditions which the Hon’ble Court may
impose on him for granting bail. The accused is ready to

Having gone through the materials, that the alleged
offences as per FIR under Sections 447 and 379 of IPC
which are non-bailable in nature and punishable for
imprisonment up to 3 years.
Herein the learned counsel for accused vehemently
argued that, the personal liberty of the accused person is
hereby curtailed by wrongfully arresting him without
following procedures. Apart from that he has furnished the
copy of complaint, in which the accused person himself
complained before the same police, by stating about the
violation of Ex-parte TI order granted by the civil Court. The
copy of the said complaint and the police acknowledgment
has     been       given    by     registering      it    in    PTN/
No.637/PTN/PPS/2022 dated 2-12-2022. Thereafter only
upon the receipt of complaint from the informant, this case
has been registered against the accused.
The following citations have been furnished by the learned

Furthermore, the personal liberty of accused person will not be
curtailed during the arrest and granting of bail U/s 437 and 439 of

suit in O.S.No. 291 of 2022 filed by the accused himself.
Furthermore, the court granted Ex-parte TI order in his favour. He
also complained before the police for the violation of the said order.

Taluk of D.K. District and he is practicing as an Advocate. He is
respected and law abiding person. He has no intention to
absconding or protracting the trial. He is ready to assist the Police
during the investigation and ready to abide by any reasonable
condition imposed by this Court at the time of his release on bail.
Having considering the facts and circumstances of the case
on hand, it is necessary to grant interim order in respect of interim
bail application. Hence, the said application is hereby allowed
subject to following conditions:
1.     The accused shall execute his personal bond for a sum
of Rs.50,000/- with a surety for like sum.

As observed hereinabove, the Court records the allegation of
the petitioner that the 4th respondent has assaulted him during his
arrest in his house at 8.00 p.m. and records that both the offences
were punishable upto 3 years, and was an offshoot of a civil
dispute. On such allegations of assault by the fourth respondent, it
is directed that intimation be sent to the higher authorities to take
necessary action against 4th respondent for violation of personal
liberty.  On grant of interim bail, the petitioner is set at liberty,
since he was injured, he is admitted to the Father Mullers Hospital
for treatment.          He was in the hospital for 2 days between
03-12-2022 and 05-12-2022. Records of admission at the hospital
and the wound certificate is also appended to the petition.                                   It
transpires that the police record the statement of the petitioner
while in the hospital, but no action is taken against the accused.
The petitioner on his discharge from the hospital and coming out of
the trauma, registers a complaint on 09-12-2022.                              The complaint

therefore, it is necessary to notice the complaint in its entirety and
is extracted for the purpose of quick reference:

The afore-extracted complaint brings in graphic details of the
alleged torture meted out against the petitioner.    The petitioner
narrates that the 4th respondent along with others enters the house
of the petitioner, does not even permit him to wear his shirt, drag
him to the jeep and when questioned about a warrant or a FIR, the
reply was with a few blows on him by the police.     The complaint
also narrates that his mother was pushed when she wanted to
protect his son and object him being taken away illegally by the
police.   It is alleged that even after indicating that he was an
Advocate, he was beaten and abused.          The complaint further
narrates that while in custody the petitioner was forced to write a
statement that he has himself taken away the gate which would
amount to admission of guilt. The complaint is also forwarded to
the Hon’ble Chief Minister, the Home Minister, the Director General
and Inspector General and the Chairman of the Human Rights
12. The learned senior counsel for the petitioner on an
affidavit has produced electronic evidence i.e., the compact disc
which records the entire incident and has also produced a transcript
of the conversation found in the compact disc, as well as
photographs of the alleged torturous behavior of police upon the
petitioner.    I have seen the electronic evidence and have noticed
the photographs that are produced before the Court.               On such
perusal, what would unmistakably emerge is the arrest of the
petitioner is illegal and contrary to the judgments rendered by the
Apex Court rendered from time to time, regarding necessity of
arrest of the kind, qua the offences alleged against the petitioner.
13. The offences alleged against the petitioner are the ones
punishable under Sections 379 and 447 of the IPC. Sections 379
and 447 of the IPC read as follows:
“379. Punishment for theft.—Whoever commits theft shall
be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term
which may extend to three years, or with fine, or with both.”
447. Punishment for criminal trespass.—Whoever
commits criminal trespass shall be punished with imprisonment of
either description for a term which may extend to three months, or
with fine which may extend to five hundred rupees, or with both.”
Section 379 deals with theft. Any person indulging in thieving
would become punishable under Section 379 of the IPC and the
maximum punishment is three years.             Section 447 deals with
criminal trespass and whoever commits criminal trespass would be
punished with a maximum term of three months or fine or both.
Therefore, the offences punishable against the petitioner even if
convicted would be for an imprisonment of 3 years to the
14. It now becomes germane to notice the judgments of the
Apex Court on the issue of either unnecessary or illegal arrest of an
accused, rendered from time to time. The Apex Court in the case of
D.K. BASU V. STATE OF W.B.,1 has held as follows:
17. Fundamental Rights occupy a place of pride in
the Indian Constitution. Article 21 provides “no person
shall be deprived of his life or personal liberty except
according to procedure established by law”. Personal
liberty, thus, is a sacred and cherished right under the
Constitution. The expression “life or personal liberty” has
been held to include the right to live with human dignity
and thus it would also include within itself a guarantee
against torture and assault by the State or its
functionaries. Article 22 guarantees protection against arrest
and detention in certain cases and declares that no person who
is arrested shall be detained in custody without being informed
of the grounds of such arrest and he shall not be denied the
right to consult and defend himself by a legal practitioner of his
choice. Clause (2) of Article 22 directs that the person arrested
and detained in custody shall be produced before the nearest
Magistrate within a period of 24 hours of such arrest, excluding
the time necessary for the journey from the place of arrest to
the Court of the Magistrate. Article 20(3) of the Constitution
lays down that a person accused of an offence shall not be
compelled to be a witness against himself. These are some of
the constitutional safeguards provided to a person with a view
to protect his personal liberty against any unjustified assault by
the State. In tune with the constitutional guarantee a number of
statutory provisions also seek to protect personal liberty, dignity
and basic human rights of the citizens. Chapter V of the Criminal
Procedure Code, 1973 deals with the powers or arrest of a
person and the safeguards which are required to be followed by
the police to protect the interest of the arrested person. Section
41 CrPC confers powers on any police officer to arrest a person
under the circumstances specified therein without any order or a
warrant of arrest from a Magistrate. Section 46 provides the
method and manner of arrest. Under this section no formality is
necessary while arresting a person. Under Section 49, the police
is not permitted to use more restraint than is necessary to
prevent the escape of the person. Section 50 enjoins every
police officer arresting any person without warrant to
communicate to him the full particulars of the offence for which
he is arrested and the grounds for such arrest. The police officer
is further enjoined to inform the person arrested that he is
entitled to be released on bail and he may arrange for sureties
in the event of his arrest for a non-bailable offence. Section 56
contains a mandatory provision requiring the police officer
making an arrest without warrant to produce the arrested
person before a Magistrate without unnecessary delay and
Section 57 echoes clause (2) of Article 22 of the Constitution of
India. There are some other provisions also like Sections 53, 54
and 167 which are aimed at affording procedural safeguards to
a person arrested by the police. Whenever a person dies in
custody of the police, Section 176 requires the Magistrate to
hold an enquiry into the cause of death.
18. However, in spite of the constitutional and
statutory provisions aimed at safeguarding the personal
liberty and life of a citizen, growing incidence of torture
and deaths in police custody has been a disturbing factor.
Experience shows that worst violations of human rights
take place during the course of investigation, when the
police with a view to secure evidence or confession often
resorts to third-degree methods including torture and
adopts techniques of screening arrest by either not
recording the arrest or describing the deprivation of
liberty merely as a prolonged interrogation. A reading of
the morning newspapers almost everyday carrying reports of
dehumanising torture, assault, rape and death in custody of
police or other governmental agencies is indeed depressing. The
increasing incidence of torture and death in custody has
assumed such alarming proportions that it is affecting the
credibility of the rule of law and the administration of criminal
justice system. The community rightly feels perturbed. Society's
cry for justice becomes louder.
19. The Third Report of the National Police Commission in
India expressed its deep concern with custodial violence and
lock-up deaths. It appreciated the demoralising effect which
custodial torture was creating on the society as a whole. It
made some very useful suggestions. It suggested:
“… An arrest during the investigation of a
cognizable case may be considered justified in one or
other of the following circumstances:
(i) The case involves a grave offence like murder,
dacoity, robbery, rape etc., and it is necessary to arrest
the accused and bring his movements under restraint to
infuse confidence among the terror-stricken victims.
(ii) The accused is likely to abscond and evade the
processes of law.
(iii) The accused is given to violent behaviour and is
likely to commit further offences unless his movements
are brought under restraint.
(iv) The accused is a habitual offender and unless
kept in custody he is likely to commit similar offences
again. It would be desirable to insist through
departmental instructions that a police officer making an
arrest should also record in the case diary the reasons for
making the arrest, thereby clarifying his conformity to
the specified guidelines. …”
The recommendations of the Police Commission (supra)
reflect the constitutional concomitants of the fundamental right
to personal liberty and freedom. These recommendations,
however, have not acquired any statutory status so far.
20. This Court in Joginder Kumar v. State of U.P.
[(1994) 4 SCC 260 : 1994 SCC (Cri) 1172] (to which one
of us, namely, Anand, J. was a party) considered the
dynamics of misuse of police power of arrest and opined:
“No arrest can be made because it is lawful for the
police officer to do so. The existence of the power to
arrest is one thing. The justification for the exercise of it
is quite another. … No arrest should be made without a
reasonable satisfaction reached after some investigation
as to the genuineness and bona fides of a complaint and a
reasonable belief both as to the person's complicity and
even so as to the need to effect arrest. Denying a person
of his liberty is a serious matter.”
21.Joginder Kumar case [(1994) 4 SCC 260 : 1994
SCC (Cri) 1172] involved arrest of a practising lawyer
who had been called to the police station in connection
with a case under inquiry on 7-1-1994. On not receiving
any satisfactory account of his whereabouts, the family
members of the detained lawyer preferred a petition in the
nature of habeas corpus before this Court on 11-1-1994 and in
compliance with the notice, the lawyer was produced on 14-1-
1994 before this Court. The police version was that during 7-1-
1994 and 14-1-1994 the lawyer was not in detention at all but
was only assisting the police to detect some cases. The detenu
asserted otherwise. This Court was not satisfied with the police
version. It is noticed that though as on that day the relief in
habeas corpus petition could not be granted but the questions
whether there had been any need to detain the lawyer for 5
days and if at all he was not in detention then why was this
Court not informed, were important questions which required an
answer. Besides, if there was detention for 5 days, for what
reason was he detained. The Court, therefore, directed the
District Judge, Ghaziabad to make a detailed enquiry and submit
his report within 4 weeks. The Court voiced its concern
regarding complaints of violations of human rights during and
after arrest. It said: (SCC pp. 263-64, paras 8 and 9)
“The horizon of human rights is expanding. At the
same time, the crime rate is also increasing. Of late, this
Court has been receiving complaints about violations of
human rights because of indiscriminate arrests. How are
we to strike a balance between the two?
A realistic approach should be made in this direction. The
law of arrest is one of balancing individual rights, liberties and
privileges, on the one hand, and individual duties, obligations
and responsibilities on the other; of weighing and balancing the
rights, liberties and privileges of the single individual and those
of individuals collectively; of simply deciding what is wanted and
where to put the weight and the emphasis; of deciding which
comes first — the criminal or society, the law violator or the law
abider ….”
This     Court    then    set  down     certain   procedural
“requirements” in cases of arrest.”
The Apex Court in the case of ARNESH KUMAR V. STATE
OF BIHAR2, holds as follows:
“7. As the offence with which we are concerned in the
present appeal, provides for a maximum punishment of
imprisonment which may extend to seven years and fine, Section
41(1)(b) CrPC which is relevant for the purpose reads as follows:
“41. When police may arrest without warrant.—(1)
Any police officer may without an order from a Magistrate and
without a warrant, arrest any person—
(b) against whom a reasonable complaint has been made, or
credible information has been received, or a reasonable
suspicion exists that he has committed a cognizable offence
punishable with imprisonment for a term which may be less
than seven years or which may extend to seven years whether
with or without fine, if the following conditions are satisfied,
(ii) the police officer is satisfied that such arrest is necessary—
(a) to prevent such person from committing any further
(b) for proper investigation of the offence; or
(c) to prevent such person from causing the evidence of the
offence to disappear or tampering with such evidence in any
(d) to prevent such person from making any inducement,
threat or promise to any person acquainted with the facts of
the case so as to dissuade him from disclosing such facts to
the court or to the police officer; or
(e) as unless such person is arrested, his presence in the
court whenever required cannot be ensured,
and the police officer shall record while making such arrest,
his reasons in writing:
Provided that a police officer shall, in all cases where the
arrest of a person is not required under the provisions of this
sub-section, record the reasons in writing for not making the
arrest.”
7.1. From a plain reading of the aforesaid provision, it is
evident that a person accused of an offence punishable with
imprisonment for a term which may be less than seven years or
which may extend to seven years with or without fine, cannot be
arrested by the police officer only on his satisfaction that such
person had committed the offence punishable as aforesaid. A police
officer before arrest, in such cases has to be further satisfied that
such arrest is necessary to prevent such person from committing
any further offence; or for proper investigation of the case; or to
prevent the accused from causing the evidence of the offence to
disappear; or tampering with such evidence in any manner; or to
prevent such person from making any inducement, threat or
promise to a witness so as to dissuade him from disclosing such
facts to the court or the police officer; or unless such accused
person is arrested, his presence in the court whenever required
cannot be ensured. These are the conclusions, which one may
reach based on facts.”
9. Another provision i.e. Section 41-A CrPC aimed to
avoid unnecessary arrest or threat of arrest looming large
on the accused requires to be vitalised. Section 41-A as
inserted by Section 6 of the Code of Criminal Procedure
(Amendment) Act, 2008 (5 of 2009), which is relevant in
the context reads as follows:
“41-A. Notice of appearance before police officer.—
(1) The police officer shall, in all cases where the arrest
of a person is not required under the provisions of sub-
section (1) of Section 41, issue a notice directing the
person against whom a reasonable complaint has been
made, or credible information has been received, or a
reasonable suspicion exists that he has committed a
cognizable offence, to appear before him or at such other
place as may be specified in the notice.
(2) Where such a notice is issued to any person, it shall
be the duty of that person to comply with the terms of the
(3) Where such person complies and continues to comply
with the notice, he shall not be arrested in respect of the
offence referred to in the notice unless, for reasons to be
recorded, the police officer is of the opinion that he ought to be
(4) Where such person, at any time, fails to comply with
the terms of the notice or is unwilling to identify himself, the
police officer may, subject to such orders as may have been
passed by a competent court in this behalf, arrest him for the
offence mentioned in the notice.”
The aforesaid provision makes it clear that in all
cases where the arrest of a person is not required under
Section 41(1) CrPC, the police officer is required to issue
notice directing the accused to appear before him at a
specified place and time. Law obliges such an accused to
appear before the police officer and it further mandates
that if such an accused complies with the terms of notice
he shall not be arrested, unless for reasons to be
recorded, the police officer is of the opinion that the
arrest is necessary. At this stage also, the condition
precedent for arrest as envisaged under Section 41 CrPC
has to be complied and shall be subject to the same
scrutiny by the Magistrate as aforesaid.
10. We are of the opinion that if the provisions of Section
41 CrPC which authorises the police officer to arrest an accused
without an order from a Magistrate and without a warrant are
scrupulously enforced, the wrong committed by the police
officers intentionally or unwittingly would be reversed and the
number of cases which come to the Court for grant of
anticipatory bail will substantially reduce. We would like to
emphasise that the practice of mechanically reproducing in the
case diary all or most of the reasons contained in Section 41
CrPC for effecting arrest be discouraged and discontinued.
11. Our endeavour in this judgment is to ensure
that police officers do not arrest the accused
unnecessarily and Magistrate do not authorise detention
casually and mechanically. In order to ensure what we
have observed above, we give the following directions:
automatically arrest when a case under Section
498-A IPC is registered but to satisfy themselves about
the necessity for arrest under the parameters laid down
above flowing from Section 41 CrPC;
11.2. All police officers be provided with a check list
containing      specified     sub-clauses     under      Section
11.3. The police officer shall forward the check list
duly filled and furnish the reasons and materials which
necessitated the arrest, while forwarding/producing the
accused before the Magistrate for further detention;
11.4. The Magistrate while authorising detention of
the accused shall peruse the report furnished by the
police officer in terms aforesaid and only after recording
its satisfaction, the Magistrate will authorise detention;
11.5. The decision not to arrest an accused, be
forwarded to the Magistrate within two weeks from the
date of the institution of the case with a copy to the
Magistrate which may be extended by the Superintendent
of Police of the district for the reasons to be recorded in
11.6. Notice of appearance in terms of Section 41-A
CrPC be served on the accused within two weeks from the
date of institution of the case, which may be extended by
the Superintendent of Police of the district for the
reasons to be recorded in writing;
11.7. Failure to comply with the directions aforesaid
shall apart from rendering the police officers concerned
liable for departmental action, they shall also be liable to
be punished for contempt of court to be instituted before
the High Court having territorial jurisdiction.
11.8. Authorising detention without recording reasons as
aforesaid by the Judicial Magistrate concerned shall be liable for
departmental action by the appropriate High Court.”
(Emphasis supplied)
In the case of MOHAMMED ZUBAIR V. STATE OF NCT OF
DELHI AND OTHERS 3, the Apex Court holds as follows:
28. Police officers are vested with the power to arrest
individuals at various stages of the criminal justice process,
including during the course of investigation. However, this
power is not unbridled. In terms of Section 41(1)(b)(ii) of the
CrPC, the police officer in question must be satisfied that such
arrest is necessary to prevent the person sought to be arrested
from committing any further offence, for proper investigation of
the offence, to prevent the arrestee from tampering with or
destroying evidence, to prevent them from influencing or
intimidating potential witnesses, or when it is not possible to
ensure their presence in court without arresting them.
29. Police officers have a duty to apply their mind to the
case before them and ensure that the condition(s) in Section 41
are met before they conduct an arrest. This Court has time and
again, reiterated the importance of doing so, including in Arnesh
Kumar v. State of Bihar,9 where the Court observed:
“6. […] The existence of the power to arrest is one
thing, the justification for the exercise of it is quite
another. Apart from power to arrest, the police officers
must be able to justify the reasons thereof. No arrest can
be made in a routine manner on a mere allegation of
commission of an offence made against a person…”
30. We once again have occasion to reiterate that
the guidelines laid down in Arnesh Kumar (supra) must
be followed, without exception. The raison d'être of the
powers of arrest in relation to cognizable offences is laid
down in Section 41. Arrest is not meant to be and must
not be used as a punitive tool because it results in one of
the gravest possible consequences emanating from
criminal law : the loss of personal liberty. Individuals
must not be punished solely on the basis of allegations,
and without a fair trial. When the power to arrest is
exercised without application of mind and without due
regard to the law, it amounts to an abuse of power. The
criminal law and its processes ought not to be
instrumentalized as a tool of harassment. Section 41 of
the CrPC as well as the safeguards in criminal law exist in
recognition of the reality that any criminal proceeding
almost inevitably involves the might of the state, with
unlimited resources at its disposal, against a lone
individual.”
Later, the Apex Court in the case of SATENDER KUMAR
ANTIL V. CBI4 has held as follows:
“27. On the scope and objective of Sections 41 and 41-A,
it is obvious that they are facets of Article 21 of the
Constitution. We need not elaborate any further, in light of the
judgment of      this Court in Arnesh       Kumar v. State of
Bihar [Arnesh Kumar v. State of Bihar, (2014) 8 SCC 273 :
(2014) 3 SCC (Cri) 449] : (SCC pp. 278-81, paras 7-12)
“7.1. From a plain reading of the aforesaid provision, it
is evident that a person accused of an offence
punishable with imprisonment for a term which may be
less than seven years or which may extend to seven
years with or without fine, cannot be arrested by the
police officer only on his satisfaction that such person
had committed the offence punishable as aforesaid. A
police officer before arrest, in such cases has to be
further satisfied that such arrest is necessary to
prevent such person from committing any further
offence; or for proper investigation of the case; or to
prevent the accused from causing the evidence of the
offence to disappear; or tampering with such evidence
in any manner; or to prevent such person from making
any inducement, threat or promise to a witness so as
to dissuade him from disclosing such facts to the court
or the police officer; or unless such accused person is
arrested, his presence in the court whenever required
cannot be ensured. These are the conclusions, which
one may reach based on facts.
7.2. The law mandates the police officer to state the facts and
record the reasons in writing which led him to come to a
conclusion covered by any of the provisions aforesaid, while
making such arrest. The law further requires the police
officers to record the reasons in writing for not making the
7.3. In pith and core, the police officer before arrest must put
a question to himself, why arrest? Is it really required? What
purpose it will serve? What object it will achieve? It is only
after these questions are addressed and one or the other
conditions as enumerated above is satisfied, the power of
arrest needs to be exercised. In fine, before arrest first the
police officers should have reason to believe on the basis of
information and material that the accused has committed the
offence. Apart from this, the police officer has to be satisfied
further that the arrest is necessary for one or the more
purposes envisaged by sub-clauses (a) to (e) of clause (1) of
8. An accused arrested without warrant by the police has the
constitutional right under Article 22(2) of the Constitution of
India and Section 57CrPC to be produced before the
Magistrate     without   unnecessary      delay   and    in   no
circumstances beyond 24 hours excluding the time necessary
8.1. During the course of investigation of a case, an accused
can be kept in detention beyond a period of 24 hours only
when it is authorised by the Magistrate in exercise of power
under Section 167CrPC. The power to authorise detention is a
very solemn function. It affects the liberty and freedom of
citizens and needs to be exercised with great care and
caution. Our experience tells us that it is not exercised with
the seriousness it deserves. In many of the cases, detention
is authorised in a routine, casual and cavalier manner.
8.2. Before a Magistrate authorises detention under Section
167CrPC, he has to be first satisfied that the arrest made is
legal and in accordance with law and all the constitutional
rights of the person arrested are satisfied. If the arrest
effected by the police officer does not satisfy the
requirements of Section 41 of the Code, Magistrate is duty-
bound not to authorise his further detention and release the
accused. In other words, when an accused is produced before
the Magistrate, the police officer effecting the arrest is
required to furnish to the Magistrate, the facts, reasons and
its conclusions for arrest and the Magistrate in turn is to be
satisfied that the condition precedent for arrest under Section
41CrPC has been satisfied and it is only thereafter that he will
authorise the detention of an accused.
8.3. The Magistrate before authorising detention will record
his own satisfaction, may be in brief but the said satisfaction
must reflect from his order. It shall never be based upon the
ipse dixit of the police officer, for example, in case the police
officer considers the arrest necessary to prevent such person
from committing any further offence or for proper
investigation of the case or for preventing an accused from
tampering with evidence or making inducement, etc. the
police officer shall furnish to the Magistrate the facts, the
reasons and materials on the basis of which the police officer
had reached its conclusion. Those shall be perused by the
Magistrate while authorising the detention and only after
recording his satisfaction in writing that the Magistrate will
authorise the detention of the accused.
8.4. In fine, when a suspect is arrested and produced before
a Magistrate for authorising detention, the Magistrate has to
address the question whether specific reasons have been
recorded for arrest and if so, prima facie those reasons are
relevant, and secondly, a reasonable conclusion could at all
be reached by the police officer that one or the other
conditions stated above are attracted. To this limited extent
the Magistrate will make judicial scrutiny.
9. … The aforesaid provision makes it clear that in all cases
where the arrest of a person is not required under Section
41(1)CrPC, the police officer is required to issue notice
directing the accused to appear before him at a specified
place and time. Law obliges such an accused to appear before
the police officer and it further mandates that if such an
accused complies with the terms of notice he shall not be
arrested, unless for reasons to be recorded, the police officer
is of the opinion that the arrest is necessary. At this stage
also, the condition precedent for arrest as envisaged under
Section 41CrPC has to be complied and shall be subject to the
same scrutiny by the Magistrate as aforesaid.
10. We are of the opinion that if the provisions of Section
41CrPC which authorises the police officer to arrest an
accused without an order from a Magistrate and without a
warrant are scrupulously enforced, the wrong committed by
the police officers intentionally or unwittingly would be
reversed and the number of cases which come to the Court
for grant of anticipatory bail will substantially reduce. We
would like to emphasise that the practice of mechanically
reproducing in the case diary all or most of the reasons
contained in Section 41CrPC for effecting arrest be
discouraged and discontinued.
11. Our endeavour in this judgment is to ensure that police
officers do not arrest the accused unnecessarily and
Magistrate do not authorise detention casually and
mechanically. In order to ensure what we have observed
above, we give the following directions:
11.1. All the State Governments to instruct its police officers
not to automatically arrest when a case under Section 498-
AIPC is registered but to satisfy themselves about the
necessity for arrest under the parameters laid down above
flowing from Section 41CrPC;
11.2. All police officers be provided with a check list
containing specified sub-clauses under Section 41(1)(b)(ii);
11.3. The police officer shall forward the check list duly filled
and furnish the reasons and materials which necessitated the
arrest, while forwarding/producing the accused before the
Magistrate for further detention;
11.4. The Magistrate while authorising detention of the
accused shall peruse the report furnished by the police officer
in terms aforesaid and only after recording its satisfaction,
the Magistrate will authorise detention;
11.5. The decision not to arrest an accused, be forwarded to
the Magistrate within two weeks from the date of the
institution of the case with a copy to the Magistrate which
may be extended by the Superintendent of Police of the
district for the reasons to be recorded in writing;
11.6. Notice of appearance in terms of Section 41-ACrPC be
served on the accused within two weeks from the date of
institution of the case, which may be extended by the
Superintendent of Police of the district for the reasons to be
recorded in writing;
11.7. Failure to comply with the directions aforesaid shall
apart from rendering the police officers concerned liable for
departmental action, they shall also be liable to be punished
for contempt of court to be instituted before the High Court
having territorial jurisdiction.
11.8. Authorising detention without recording reasons as
aforesaid by the Judicial Magistrate concerned shall be liable
for departmental action by the appropriate High Court.
12. We hasten to add that the directions aforesaid shall not
only apply to the cases under Section 498-AIPC or Section 4
of the Dowry Prohibition Act, the case in hand, but also such
cases where offence is punishable with imprisonment for a
term which may be less than seven years or which may
extend to seven years, whether with or without fine.
29. Despite the dictum of this Court in Arnesh
Kumar [Arnesh Kumar v. State of Bihar, (2014) 8 SCC 273
: (2014) 3 SCC (Cri) 449] , no concrete step has been
taken to comply with the mandate of Section 41-A of the
Code. This Court has clearly interpreted Sections
41(1)(b)(i)     and    (ii)    inter  alia   holding     that
notwithstanding the existence of a reason to believe qua
a police officer, the satisfaction for the need to arrest
shall also be present. Thus, sub-clause (1)(b)(i) of
Section 41 has to be read along with sub-clause (ii) and
therefore both the elements of “reason to believe” and
“satisfaction qua an arrest” are mandated and
accordingly are to be recorded by the police officer.
32. We also expect the courts to come down heavily
on the officers effecting arrest without due compliance of
Section 41 and Section 41-A. We express our hope that
the investigating agencies would keep in mind the law
laid down in Arnesh Kumar [Arnesh Kumar v. State of
Bihar, (2014) 8 SCC 273 : (2014) 3 SCC (Cri) 449] , the
discretion to be exercised on the touchstone of
presumption of innocence, and the safeguards provided
under Section 41, since an arrest is not mandatory. If
discretion is exercised to effect such an arrest, there shall
be procedural compliance. Our view is also reflected by
the interpretation of the specific provision under Section
60-A of the Code which warrants the officer concerned to
make the arrest strictly in accordance with the Code.”
(Emphasis supplied)
The Apex Court in the case of D.K.BASU holds that
fundamental    rights  occupy    a   place of  pride  in  the   Indian
Constitution. Article 21 of the Constitution of India mandates that
no person shall be deprived of his life or personal liberty except in
accordance with the procedure established by law. Personal liberty
thus, is held a sacred and cherished right under the Constitution.
The Apex Court also records that arrest of an accused during
investigation of a cognizable offence would be considered justified
only in one of those circumstances narrated. The Apex Court in the
case of ARNESH KUMAR holds that, in offences which are
punishable with less than seven years of imprisonment, merely
because power of arrest is available, the accused should not be
arrested unless a notice is issued under Section 41-A of the Cr.P.C.,
and summoned for questioning.       The Apex Court then lays down
guidelines clearly observing that an arrest cannot be automatic
unless the Police satisfy themselves about the necessity of arrest
and before doing so a notice of appearance in terms of Section 41-A
Cr.P.C. should be issued. This is followed by the Apex Court in the
case of MOHAMMED ZUBAIR. The Apex Court holds that arrest is
not meant to be and must not be used as a punitive tool because it
results in gravest possible consequence emanating from criminal
law, the loss of personal liberty.   This is reiterated by the Apex
Court in the case of SATENDER KUMAR ANTIL holding that it is
expected of the Courts to come down heavily on officers who effect
arrest without due compliance with Sections 41 and 41A of the
Cr.P.C. and the guidelines laid down by the Apex Court in ARNESH
KUMAR.       The aforesaid are the distilled essence of what the Apex
Court holds concerning issues of illegal arrest and snatching away
personal liberty of an accused.
15. It is trite law that no arrest can be made because it is
lawful for the Police to do so. The existence of power to arrest is
one thing and justification for the said exercise is another. No arrest
should be made without a reasonable satisfaction reached after
some investigation as to the genuineness and bonafides of the
complaint/information, as any arrest would deny a person of his
liberty, which is a very serious matter, as arrest brings humiliation,
curtails freedom and casts a scar forever.
16. If the case at hand is considered on the bedrock of the
principles laid down by the Apex Court in the aforesaid cases, what
would unmistakably emerge is, the personal liberty of the petitioner
is snatched away by the 4th respondent and his cohorts in a brutal
manner without even a warrant of arrest or even registration of an
FIR.   The records would reveal that he has been assaulted and
tortured throughout his travel in the jeep and has later been
threatened to give evidence against himself, all of which cannot but
be termed to be grossly illegal and blatantly highhanded.           The
power of arrest of an accused is misused and abused in the case at
17. It is on the aforesaid acts of blatant violation of law the
complainant registers the complaint on 09-12-2022. No crime
comes to be registered immediately ostensibly on the ground that
the complaint was against the 4th respondent who was the Station
House Officer of Punjalakatte Police Station and others of the same
police station. It is then the petitioner knocked at the doors of this
Court, seeking the following prayers:
1. Issue a Writ of Mandamus or any other appropriate Writ /
Directions to the State of Karnataka / Respondent no. 1 and
3 to register FIR against the respondent No. 4 for the
offenses under the Indian Penal Code and other enactment
for indulging in committing wrongful confinement, assault
and other offenses against the Petitioner as detailed in the
complaint submitted by the Petitioner vide Annexure-J.
2. Issue a writ of mandamus directing respondent No. 1 and 3
to initiate disciplinary action against Respondent No. 4 for
misusing the position and power and indulging in committing
wrongful confinement, assault and other offenses against the
Petitioner as detailed in the complaint submitted by the
petitioner vide Annexure-J.
3. Issue a Writ of Mandamus or any other appropriate
Writs/Directions to the State of Karnataka/ Respondent
number 1 to take immediate action against the Respondent
No.4 police by initiating disciplinary action for violating the
guidelines issued by the Hon’ble Apex Court by illegal
arresting, detaining and assaulting the Petitioner and
registering FIR in Crime No. 94/22 of Punjalkatte Police
Station vide Annexure-‘D’ as detailed in the complaint
submitted by the Petitioner vide Annexure-J.
4. Issue appropriate Writs or directions to the State of
Karnataka/ Respondent No 1 and 3 to hold enquiry against
the Respondent No. 4 regarding the illegalities and lapses in
the registration of criminal case against the Petitioner and
take appropriate action against the Respondent no. 4 official
for illegal arrest and registration of FIR as detailed in the
complaint submitted by the Petitioner vide Annexure-J.
5. Issue a writ of mandamus or any other appropriate writ or
directions directing the Respondents (jointly and severally
liable) to pay a compensation of Rs. 25,00,000/- to the
petitioner for the sufferance due to atrocities committed by
the Respondent No.4 vide Annexure-J.
6. Grant such and further reliefs as this Hon’ble Court may
deem fit to grant in the interest of justice and equity.”
This Court issued notice and sought the status of the complaint,
even then the FIR was not registered.         It is only on 05-01-2023,
the FIR comes to be registered against the 4th respondent and one
Prakash and another in Crime No.1 of 2023.            Therefore, the first
prayer of the petitioner has been met with, by registration of the
crime against 4th respondent and others in FIR No.1/2023.
18. In view of the preceding analysis, it now becomes
germane to consider the other prayers sought by the petitioner
(supra). In the light of the finding that the arrest of the petitioner
was illegal and contrary to the guidelines laid down by ARNESH
KUMAR as affirmed by subsequent judgments, the petitioner
becomes entitled to grant of compensation for such illegal arrest
and assault by the agents of the State i.e., the police. Reference
being made to the judgment of the Apex Court in the case of SUBE
SINGH V. STATE OF HARYANA5 in the circumstances becomes
apposite. The Apex Court has held as follows:
31. Though illegal detention and custodial torture were
recognised as violations of the fundamental rights of life and liberty
guaranteed under Article 21, to begin with, only the following
reliefs were being granted in the writ petitions under Article 32 or
(a) direction to set at liberty the person detained, if the
complaint was one of illegal detention.
(b) direction to the Government concerned to hold an inquiry
and take action against the officers responsible for the violation.
(c) if the enquiry or action taken by the department
concerned was found to be not satisfactory, to direct an inquiry by
an independent agency, usually the Central Bureau of
Award of compensation as a public law remedy for violation
of the fundamental rights enshrined in Article 21 of the
Constitution, in addition to the private law remedy under the law of
torts, was evolved in the last two-and-a-half decades.
32. In the Bhagalpur Blinding case [Khatri (II) v. State of
he then was), speaking for the Bench, posed the following question
while considering the relief that could be given by a court for
violation of constitutional rights guaranteed in Article 21 of the
Constitution: (SCC p. 630, para 4)
“[B]ut if life or personal liberty is violated otherwise
than in accordance with such procedure, is the court
helpless to grant relief to the person who has suffered such
deprivation? Why should the court not be prepared to forge
new tools and devise new remedies for the purpose of
vindicating the most precious of the precious fundamental
right to life and personal liberty.”
The question was expanded in a subsequent order in
Bhagalpur Blinding case [Khatri (IV) v. State of Bihar [(1981) 2
SCC 493 : 1981 SCC (Cri) 503] ] thus: (SCC p. 504, para 7)
“If an officer of the State acting in his official capacity
threatens to deprive a person of his life or personal liberty without
the authority of law, can such person not approach the court for
injuncting the State from acting through such officer in violation of
his fundamental right under Article 21? Can the State urge in
defence in such a case that it is not infringing the fundamental right
of the petitioner under Article 21, because the officer who is
threatening to do so is acting outside the law and therefore beyond
the scope of his authority and hence the State is not responsible for
his action? Would this not make a mockery of Article 21 and reduce
it to nullity, a mere rope of sand, for, on this view, if the officer is
acting according to law there would ex concessionis be no breach of
Article 21 and if he is acting without the authority of law, the State
would be able to contend that it is not responsible for his action and
therefore there is no violation of Article 21. So also if there is any
threatened invasion by the State of the fundamental right
guaranteed under Article 21, the petitioner who is aggrieved can
move the court under Article 32 for a writ injuncting such
threatened invasion and if there is any continuing action of the
State which is violative of the fundamental right under Article 21,
the petitioner can approach the court under Article 32 and ask for a
writ striking down the continuance of such action, but where the
action taken by the State has already resulted in breach of the
fundamental right under Article 21 by deprivation of some limb of
the petitioner, would the petitioner have no remedy under Article
32 for breach of the fundamental right guaranteed to him? Would
the court permit itself to become helpless spectator of the violation
of the fundamental right of the petitioner by the State and tell the
petitioner that though the Constitution has guaranteed the
fundamental right to him and has also given him the fundamental
right of moving the court for enforcement of his fundamental right,
the court cannot give him any relief.”
33. Answering the said questions, it was held that when a
court trying the writ petition proceeds to inquire into the violation
of any right to life or personal liberty, while in police custody, it
does so, not for the purpose of adjudicating upon the guilt of any
particular officer with a view to punishing him but for the purpose
of deciding whether the fundamental right of the petitioners under
Article 21 has been violated and the State is liable to pay
compensation to them for such violation. This Court clarified that
the nature and object of the inquiry is altogether different from that
in a criminal case and any decision arrived at in the writ petition on
this issue cannot have any relevance much less any binding effect,
in any criminal proceeding which may be taken against a particular
police officer. This Court further clarified that in a given case, if the
investigation is still proceeding, the Court may even defer the
inquiry before it until the investigation is completed or if the Court
considered it necessary in the interests of justice, it may postpone
its inquiry until after the prosecution was terminated, but that is a
matter entirely for the exercise of the discretion of the Court and
there is no bar precluding the Court from proceeding with the
inquiry before it, even if the investigation or prosecution is pending.
34. In Rudul Sah v. State of Bihar [(1983) 4 SCC 141 : 1983
SCC (Cri) 798] the petitioner therein approached this Court under
Article 32 of the Constitution alleging that though he was acquitted
by the Sessions Court on 3-6-1968, he was released from jail only
on 6-10-1982, after 14 years, and sought compensation for his
illegal detention. This Court while recognising that Article 32 cannot
be used as a substitute for the enforcement of rights and
obligations which can be enforced efficaciously through the ordinary
processes of courts, civil and criminal, raised for consideration the
important question as to whether in the exercise of its jurisdiction
under Article 32, this Court can pass an order for payment of
money, as compensation for the deprivation of a fundamental right.
This Court answered the question thus while awarding
compensation: (SCC pp. 147-48, para 10)
“Article 21 which guarantees the right to life and
liberty will be denuded of its significant content if the power
of this Court were limited to passing orders of release from
illegal detention. One of the telling ways in which the
violation of that right can reasonably be prevented and due
compliance with the mandate of Article 21 secured, is to
mulct     its violators      in    the   payment      of monetary
compensation. Administrative sclerosis leading to flagrant
infringement of fundamental rights cannot be corrected by
any other method open to the judiciary to adopt. The right to
compensation is some palliative for the unlawful acts of
instrumentalities which act in the name of public interest
and which present for their protection the powers of the
State as a shield. If civilisation is not to perish in this
country as it has perished in some others too well known to
suffer mention, it is necessary to educate ourselves into
accepting that, respect for the rights of individuals is the
true bastion of democracy. Therefore, the State must repair
the damage done by its officers to the petitioner's rights. It
may have recourse against those officers.”
Rudul Sah [(1983) 4 SCC 141 : 1983 SCC (Cri) 798] was
followed in Bhim Singh v. State of J&K [(1985) 4 SCC 677 : 1986
SCC (Cri) 47] and Peoples' Union for Democratic Rights v. Police
35. The law was crystallised in Nilabati Behera v. State of
Orissa [(1993) 2 SCC 746 : 1993 SCC (Cri) 527] . In that case, the
deceased was arrested by the police, handcuffed and kept in police
custody. The next day, his dead body was found on a railway track.
This Court awarded compensation to the mother of the deceased.
J.S. Verma, J. (as he then was) spelt out the following principles:
“[A]ward of compensation in a proceeding under
Article 32 by this Court or by the High Court under Article
226 of the Constitution is a remedy available in public law,
based on strict liability for contravention of fundamental
rights to which the principle of sovereign immunity does not
apply, even though it may be available as a defence in
private law in an action based on tort.
… enforcement of the constitutional right and grant of
redress embraces award of compensation as part of the
legal consequences of its contravention.
… ‘a claim in public law for compensation’ for
contravention of human rights and fundamental freedoms,
the protection of which is guaranteed in the Constitution, is
an acknowledged remedy for enforcement and protection of
such rights, and such a claim based on strict liability made
by resorting to a constitutional remedy provided for the
enforcement of a fundamental right is ‘distinct from, and in
addition to, the remedy in private law for damages for the
tort’ resulting from the contravention of the fundamental
right. The defence of sovereign immunity being inapplicable,
and alien to the concept of guarantee of fundamental rights,
there can be no question of such a defence being available in
the constitutional remedy. It is this principle which justifies
award of monetary compensation for contravention of
fundamental rights guaranteed by the Constitution, when
that is the only practicable mode of redress available for the
contravention made by the State or its servants in the
purported exercise of their powers, and enforcement of the
fundamental right is claimed by resort to the remedy in
public law under the Constitution by recourse to Articles 32
and 226 of the Constitution. (SCC pp. 762-63, paras 16-17)”
(emphasis supplied)
36. Dr. A.S. Anand, J., (as he then was) in his concurring
judgment elaborated the principle thus:
“[C]onvicts, prisoners or undertrials are not denuded of their
fundamental rights under Article 21 and it is only such restrictions,
as are permitted by law, which can be imposed on the enjoyment
of the fundamental rights by such persons. It is an obligation of the
State to ensure that there is no infringement of the indefeasible
rights of a citizen to life, except in accordance with law, while the
citizen is in its custody.
The public law proceedings serve a different purpose
than the private law proceedings. The relief of monetary
compensation, as exemplary damages, in proceedings under
Article 32 by [the Supreme] Court or under Article 226 by
the High Courts, for established infringement of the
indefeasible right guaranteed under Article 21 of the
Constitution is a remedy available in public law and is based
on the strict liability for contravention of the guaranteed
basic and indefeasible rights of the citizen. The purpose of
public law is not only to civilise public power but also to
assure the citizens that they live under a legal system which
aims to protect their interests and preserve their rights.
Therefore, when the court moulds the relief by granting
‘compensation’ in proceedings under Article 32 or 226 of the
Constitution        seeking    enforcement     or    protection    of
fundamental rights, it does so under the public law by way
of penalising the wrongdoer and fixing the liability for the
public wrong on the State which has failed in its public duty
to protect the fundamental rights of the citizen. The
payment of compensation in such cases is not to be
understood as it is generally understood in a civil action for
damages under the private law but in the broader sense of
providing relief by an order of making ‘monetary amends’
under the public law for the wrong done due to breach of
public duty, of not protecting the fundamental rights of the
citizen. The compensation is in the nature of ‘exemplary
damages’ awarded against the wrongdoer for the breach of
its public law duty and is independent of the rights available
to the aggrieved party to claim compensation under the
private law in an action based on tort, through a suit
instituted in a court of competent jurisdiction or/and
prosecute the offender under the penal law.
(SCC pp. 768-69, para 34)”
37. In D.K. Basu v. State of W.B. [(1997) 1 SCC 416 : 1997
SCC (Cri) 92] this Court again considered exhaustively the question
and held that monetary compensation should be awarded for
established infringement of fundamental rights guaranteed under
Article 21. This Court held:
“Custodial violence, including torture and death in the lock-
ups, strikes a blow at the rule of law, which demands that the
powers of the executive should not only be derived from law but
also that the same should be limited by law. Custodial violence is a
matter of concern. It is aggravated by the fact that it is committed
by persons who are supposed to be the protectors of the citizens. It
is committed under the shield of uniform and authority in the four
walls of a police station or lock-up, the victim being totally helpless.
The protection of an individual from torture and abuse by the police
and other law-enforcing officers is a matter of deep concern in a
free society.
Any form of torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading
treatment would fall within the inhibition of Article 21 of the
Constitution, whether it occurs during investigation, interrogation
or otherwise. If the functionaries of the Government become
lawbreakers, it is bound to breed contempt for law and would
encourage lawlessness and every man would have the tendency to
become law unto himself thereby leading to anarchy. No civilised
nation can permit that to happen. Does a citizen shed off his
fundamental right to life, the moment a policeman arrests him?
Can the right to life of a citizen be put in abeyance on his arrest? …
The answer, indeed, has to be an emphatic ‘No’.
Police is, no doubt, under a legal duty and has legitimate
right to arrest a criminal and to interrogate him during the
investigation of an offence but it must be remembered that the law
does not permit use of third-degree methods or torture of accused
in custody during interrogation and investigation with a view to
solve the crime. End cannot justify the means. The interrogation
and investigation into a crime should be in true sense purposeful to
make the investigation effective. By torturing a person and using
third-degree methods, the police would be accomplishing behind
the closed doors what the demands of our legal order forbid. No
society can permit it.”
38. It is thus now well settled that the award of
compensation against the State is an appropriate and
effective remedy for redress of an established infringement
of a fundamental right under Article 21, by a public servant.
The quantum of compensation will, however, depend upon
the facts and circumstances of each case. Award of such
compensation (by way of public law remedy) will not come
in the way of the aggrieved person claiming additional
compensation in a civil court, in the enforcement of the
private law remedy in tort, nor come in the way of the
criminal court ordering compensation under Section 357 of
the Code of Criminal Procedure.”
39. This takes us to the next question as to whether
compensation should be awarded under Articles 32/226 for every
violation of Article 21 where illegal detention or custodial violence is
The Apex Court holds that the attitude to arrest and then
proceed with the rest is despicable and has become a handy tool to
police officers who lack sensitivity or act with oblique motive. The
observations of the Apex Court are apt to be applied in the case at
hand. The arrest of the petitioner has been in violation of Article 21
of the Constitution of India and the petitioner was compelled to face
humiliation.   The act of the police is not   only in violation of the
guidelines issued by the Apex Court right from the judgment in the
case of D.K.BASU, upto the judgment of SATENDAR KUMAR
ANTIL.     There is flagrant violation of the mandate of the law
enshrined under Sections 41 and 41-A of the Cr.P.C. The police can
in no circumstance flout the law with such brazen proclivity. It is in
these circumstances, the public law remedy which has been
postulated by the Apex Court in several judgments as also in the
judgments quoted hereinabove comes into play. The Constitutional
Courts in exercise of their jurisdiction of public law remedy have
taken note of the suffering and humiliation and have held those
citizens who have faced such suffering and humiliation at the hands
of the agents of the State to be entitled to grant of compensation,
reserving liberty to claim further damages before a competent civil
Court. This has been regarded by the Apex Court as a redeeming
feature. The arrest of the petitioner is held to be illegal in view of
the preceding analysis and contrary to the guidelines issued by the
Apex Court in the case of ARNESH KUMAR, the petitioner becomes
entitled to compensation to be paid by the State which is assessed
at Rs.3,00,000/-.     This will not come in the way of the petitioner
claiming additional compensation in a competent civil Court in
enforcement of a private law remedy.
19. The petitioner is an advocate, a responsible officer of any
Court of law in which he would profess to practice. Being an Officer
of any Court, it is the primary duty of any Advocate to assist the
Court in dispensation of justice.         This is the sacrosanct role
assigned to an Advocate. Notwithstanding the petitioner being an
Advocate, he is illegally detained and assaulted, even after bringing
it to the notice of the police that he is an Advocate, an Officer of the
Court. If an Advocate could be treated in the manner of what he
has been meted out in the case at hand, a common man will not be
able to bear the brunt of repetition of such treatment.           It is,
therefore, the perpetrators of such illegality and violators of law, as
is laid down by the Apex Court, cannot be left off the hook. They
must be proceeded against both in a departmental inquiry, to fix
accountability, and under the criminal law to deter any such
iteration as, “injustice anywhere; is a threat to justice
