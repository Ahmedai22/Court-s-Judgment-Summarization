This Court vide order dated 08.07.2022, has permitted the
applicant/father to take the minor child to his residence from the
respondent/wife's residence in alternative days in a week and spend
time with the minor child at evening hours between 6.00 P.M. and
8.00 P.M. at the applicant/father's residence.
2. Today, when the matter is taken up for hearing, the learned
counsel     appearing   for   the    Applicant      submitted      that     the
Respondent/Wife intends to take the child to Delhi and settle there
itself.
3. The learned counsel appearing for the Respondent/Wife
submitted that she is working in Citi Bank in Chennai and the child is
O.P.No.633 of 2021 & O.A.No.627 of 2021 &
also studying in a school at Sholinganallur and she has no intention
to take the Child from Chennai to Delhi.               The learned counsel
appearing for the Respondent/Wife has expressed some difficulties in
implementation of the order dated 08.07.2022 and seeks for
modification.
4. After hearing the submissions made by the learned counsel
appearing on either side, the order dated 08.07.2022 is modified to
the effect that the applicant/father    is     permitted        to visit the
child    in the residence of the Respondent/Wife on every Friday and
Saturday between 6.00 P.M.to 8.00 P.M.and spend some time with
the child.
5. In fact, this Court often comes across with many instances of
ill-treatment and non-co-operation by one spouse towards the other
who visits to see his/her child in the his/her presence, which
promoted him/her again to initiate proceedings before the police and

Court of law.
6. Marriage is a sacrosanct and holy union of two individuals
and a child is the fruit of marriage. Bringing up a child is a duty for
both parents.
7. Separation is a misfortune, not much for spouses, but great
for the children born to them, who are the ultimate sufferers
undergoing emotional pain and mental trauma silently.                  During
separation, both spouses are not required to treat each other with
equal respect or with love, but humanity demands to be nice to the
other in front of their children.
8. Every child has a right to access both parents and get the love
and affection of both parents. Whatever be the differences between
the spouses, the child cannot be denied company of the other spouse.
O.P.No.633 of 2021 & O.A.No.627 of 2021 &
9. Taking into consideration the concern and eagerness of
estranged parents to see his/her child, this Court permits him/her to
have access and spend some time with the child. But unfortunately,
taking advantage of custody of the child, some spouses, having
developed animosity towards the other, giving scant regard to the
orders/directions of this Court, used to misbehave and indulge in ill-
treating the spouse who visits to see his/her child which leads to
quarrelling each other in front of the child, by which, the child gets
extremely disappointed rather disturbed.          Further, this creates a
sensation of panic within the child and he/she feels frightened and
helpless. These feelings of vulnerability and insecurity can shape a
child's personality and last a lifetime.
10. Further, this Court also came across the instances wherein
some parents are even indulging in parental alienation which drives
the child to behave indifferently with the visiting parent, which is an
inhuman act which deliberately poisoned the minds of the children
O.P.No.633 of 2021 & O.A.No.627 of 2021 &
against the mother/father to whom, they formerly loved and needed.
11. Every child has a right and need for an unthreatened and
loving relationship with both the parents. To be denied that right by
one parent, without sufficient justification, is itself a form of child
abuse. Severe effects of parental alienation on children are self
hatred, lack of trust, depression etc., as the children lose the capacity
to give and accept love from a parent. Hatred is not an emotion that
comes naturally to vast majority of children; it has to be taught. A
Parent who would teach a child to hate or fear the other parent
represents a grave and persistent danger to the mental and emotional
health of that child. Alienated children are no less damaged than
other child victims of extreme conflict, however abusive that
relationship may be.
12. Therefore, in the interest and welfare of the children, it is
the prime duty of both the parents to act and behave friendly before
O.P.No.633 of 2021 & O.A.No.627 of 2021 &
their child so that the child feels secured and enjoys the moments in
the company of both parents which develops positive feelings in him
and at the same time, parents regain peace and happiness in the
company of the children.
13. This Court expects that the spouses would comply with the
orders/direction of this Court in the matter of visitation rights
granting in favour of the spouses, without any deviation and only due
to parental alienation, sometimes, the children are not willing and co-
operating to see their mother/father, in which case, it is the obligation
of the parents to explain the visitation rights of the abandoned parent
and convince the children to move and spend with their
mother/father. In the event there is failure on the part of the spouse
who possesses the custody of the child, he/she will be held
responsible for non-compliance of the order and ultimately, it would
be considered that he/she is incapable of maintaining the child in
his/her custody.
O.P.No.633 of 2021 & O.A.No.627 of 2021 &
14. The spouse shall treat other spouse, though not as
wife/husband due personal indifferences, but atleast treat him/her as
a guest by paying more attention than wife/husband since in our
customs and practice, a guest is treated as “Athidi Devo Bhava
(Guest is God)” and show kindness and empathy towards the guest
who is none other than the parent of the child and respect him/her in
front of the child.
15. If any parent indulges either in parental alienation or fail to
comply with the order/direction of this Court, the matter will be
viewed very seriously and appropriate orders would be passed.
16. In the light of the above, the order dated 08.07.2022 is
modified     accordingly.   It  is   made      clear     that    when       the
applicant/husband visits the residence of the respondent/wife to see
his child and spend time with him, the respondent/wife is directed to
receive him and allow him to spend time with his child without any
O.P.No.633 of 2021 & O.A.No.627 of 2021 &
inconvenience. Further, the respondent/wife is directed to show
hospitality by providing snacks and dinner, etc., to him and have the
same along with her child, which means husband, wife and children
altogether and create a healthy atmosphere so that the child should
feel happy and enjoy the moments by spending with his parents.
