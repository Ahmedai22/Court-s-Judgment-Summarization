The captioned second appeal is filed by the defendant
No.1 questioning the judgment and decree of the Appellate
Court wherein the Appellate Court has decreed the suit in
entirety and share is granted to the plaintiff in all the
2.        For the sake of brevity, the parties are referred to
as per their rank before the Court below.
3.        The family tree of the parties is as follows:
4.      The original plaintiff Muni Anjanappa who is the
father of defendant No.1 filed a suit for partition and separate
possession in O.S.No.29/2006.          The original plaintiff Muni
Anjanappa claimed that suit schedule properties were acquired
through joint family funds.        It was contended that original
plaintiff Muni Anjanappa on account of old age was not in a
position to manage the affairs of the family and therefore,
defendant No.1 being the eldest son was allowed to manage
the affairs of the joint family as Kartha of the family.
Therefore, the original plaintiff Muni Anjanappa contended that
all the properties acquired in the name of defendant No.1 were
by utilizing joint family corpus and therefore, the original
plaintiff filed a suit for partition against the sons and claimed
share in all the properties.
5.      Pending suit, the original plaintiff Muni Anjanappa
died and his daughter who was originally arrayed as defendant
No.5 got transposed as plaintiff.           The original plaintiff
instituted    the  present   suit   by  specifically alleging that
defendant No.1 is acting adversely to the interest of the
plaintiff and therefore, the present suit came to be filed.
6.    The defendant No.1, on receipt of summons,
tendered appearance and filed written statement and stoutly
denied the entire averments made in the plaint. However, the
defendant No.1 admitted the relationship between himself with
other    defendants   and   original plaintiff Muni   Anjanappa.
However, the allegation that all suit schedule properties are
joint family ancestral properties was stoutly denied by the
defendant No.1.     The defendant No.1 specifically contended
that except item No.9 of schedule ‘A’ property, all other
properties are self acquired properties and therefore, are not
available for partition.   The defendant No.1 has furnished all
the details and has disclosed the source of acquisition in the
written statement.
7.    It was also specifically averred in the written
statement that item Nos.a, b, m, n, o as well as c, d and e of
schedule ‘B’ properties are his self acquired properties.     The
defendant No.1 has further claimed that item Nos.1 and 12
were acquired by him in a compromise decree passed in
O.S.No.61/1988 while he acquired right and title in item Nos.2
and 6 by way of adverse possession.         He further contended
that he acquired absolute right over item Nos.3 and 5 under
registered gift deed executed by his uncle.           Further, he
contended that item Nos.4 and 10 were purchased by him
through registered sale deed.          While defendants further
pleaded that item Nos.7 and 11 do not belong to joint family
but, however, his name was mutated to the revenue records.
Insofar as item No.8 is concerned, he contended that it
originally belonged to Dodda Kempanna and after the death of
his uncle, defendant No.1’s name was mutated to the revenue
records.    The defendant No.1, however, admitted that item
No.9 is the joint family property.
8.    The plaintiff i.e., the daughter of Muni Anjanappa to
substantiate the claim of original plaintiff let in oral evidence.
She examined herself as PW.1 and one independent witness
as PW.2 and relied on documentary evidence vide Exs.P-1 to
P-34. The defendant No.1 to substantiate his claim examined
himself as DW.1 and one independent witness as DW.2 and
relied on rebuttal documentary evidence vide Exs.D-1 to D-6.
9.    The   Trial  Court  having   examined    oral  and
documentary evidence has come to conclusion that only item
Nos.7 and 9 of schedule ‘A’ property are joint family ancestral
property and therefore, proceeded to grant half share to the
plaintiff and defendant No.1. While defendant Nos.2 to 4 were
allotted half share in the share of defendant No.1. The Trial
Court however, proceeded to dismiss the suit insofar as item
Nos.1 to 6, 8, 10 to 12 of schedule ‘A’ property and schedule
‘B’ properties.
10.   Feeling aggrieved by the judgment and decree of
the Trial Court, the plaintiff preferred appeal before the
11.  The Appellate Court having assessed oral and
documentary evidence has placed strong reliance on Ex.P-20
which is styled as ‘panchayath palupatti’.   The plaintiff has
placed reliance on Ex.P-20 and a contention was taken that
the contents of Ex.P-20 clearly indicates that all the suit
schedule properties are admitted to be joint family ancestral
properties in the said document. The Appellate Court relying
on Ex.P-20 was of the view that defendant No.1 has agreed
under Ex.P-20 to allot half share. The Appellate Court was of
the view that plaintiff and defendant No.1 have amicably
resolved to share the properties equally.       It is in this
background, Appellate Court by placing reliance on oral
evidence of PW.2 has arrived at a conclusion that Ex.P-20 is
proved by the plaintiff.     Though the said document was
seriously challenged by the defendant No.1 by contending that
his father never participated in the panchayath, was however
negatived by the Appellate Court on an assumption that since
Muni Anjanappa had already filed a suit would negate the
defence set up by the defendant No.1 in regard to non-
participation of Muni Anjanappa during settlement before the
panchayath and the same would lose its significance.            The
Appellate Court has also drawn adverse inference against the
defendant No.1 who has not whispered even a word for having
affixed the signature on Ex.P-20.
12.   The   Appellate    Court  placing   reliance  on    the
judgment rendered by the Hon’ble Apex Court in the case of
Polti Lakshmi vs. Krishnavenamma rendered in AIR 1965 SC
825   was    of  the  view   that   palupatti does    not  require
registration. It is in this background, Appellate Court was of
the view that defendant No.1 who is a party to Ex.P-20 and
the fact that evidence of PW.2 who is a witness to Ex.P-20 has
gone unchallenged, the Appellate Court finding fault with the
findings recorded by the Trial Court on Ex.P-20 has reversed
the decree of the Trial Court and consequently share is
granted in all the items i.e., schedule ‘A’ and ‘B’ properties.
13.    The  defendant No.1      feeling aggrieved by the
judgment and decree of the Appellate Court has filed the
captioned second appeal.
14.    This Court    vide  order    dated   16.08.2010   has
admitted the appeal on the following substantial question of
“Whether the lower Appellate Court was justified
in decreeing the suit of the plaintiff for partition in
respect of the suit items on the basis of Ex.P-20,
which is an unregistered document and not signed by
15.    Heard learned counsel for the defendant No.1 and
learned    counsel    appearing   for   the   plaintiff.    I have
meticulously examined the judgment rendered by both the
Courts.    I have also given my anxious consideration to the
judgments cited by the respective counsels, more particularly
the judgment cited by the learned counsel appearing for the
16.   This is a peculiar case where father files a suit
against his children, more particularly against defendant No.1
who is also one of the son of original plaintiff Muni Anjanappa.
In schedule ‘A’, in all there are 12 items while schedule ‘B’
properties are movable properties.      The defendant No.1 has
admitted that except item No.9 of schedule ‘A’, all the other
properties are his self acquired properties and therefore, the
same are not available for partition.       The initial burden to
establish   that   suit  schedule   properties  are   joint family
ancestral properties is on the plaintiff.    The Appellate Court
has reversed the findings and conclusions of the Trial Court by
placing total reliance on Ex.P-20.     Therefore, the substantial
question of law formulated by this Court also revolves around
the relevance of Ex.P-20, its evidentiary value and the rights
of the plaintiff in terms of Ex.P-20.
17.   Before I proceed further, it would be useful for this
Court to cull out Ex.P-20 which reads as under:

L.T.M of C±ÀévÀÛªÀÄä                         ¸À»:
18.    This document is dated 15.11.2001.                  The original
plaintiff Muni Anjanappa has instituted the suit on 22.11.1996.
Therefore, this document has come into existence during the
pendency of the suit.            Ex.P-20 does not indicate that Muni
Anjanappa participated in the panchayath talks and he was a
signatory to Ex.P-20. In Ex.P-20, it is the daughter who later
got transposed as plaintiff has participated in the said talks
and the said document is signed by the defendant No.1 and
the daughter i.e., the present plaintiff.
19.    The document under Ex.P-20 clearly indicates that
daughter i.e., plaintiff and defendant No.1 has resolved to
equally share all the suit schedule properties.                      The said
document is admittedly an unregistered document.                             The
contention of learned counsel for the plaintiff is that the said
document amounts to family arrangement which does not
require registration and therefore, Ex.P-20 is very much
admissible in evidence and can be looked into. Therefore, the
counsel for plaintiff has contended that Appellate Court was
justified in placing reliance on Ex.P-20 and therefore, the said
document cannot be ignored or discarded for want of
20.  The question that needs to be examined by this
Court is whether Ex.P-20 amounts to family settlement.         On
bare perusal of Ex.P-20, the same cannot be accepted as a
family settlement. The original plaintiff i.e., Muni Anjanappa is
not a signatory to Ex.P-20. The family settlement should be
among all the family members who agree to common terms
and    conditions.     Therefore,  family    settlement  involves
participation and the same needs to be signed by all the
members and there has to be an acknowledgment when the
agreement is arrived at, free of duress and coercion within the
family members. A family settlement is admissible in evidence
provided that the agreement is confirmed with approval of all
family members who firmly support resolution given in the
agreement at a later date which does not require registration.
21.   On perusal of Ex.P-20, this Court is of the view that
Ex.P-20 is not in the nature of a family arrangement as all the
family members have not participated and have not signed
Ex.P-20. Ex.P-20 does not indicate that all the assets are part
of a common family.     It also does not indicate that original
plaintiff Muni Anjanappa and other family members have an
antecedent title and right over all the suit schedule properties.
The main requirement of a family arrangement is that all the
family members have to agree and such an agreement should
indicate that rights and title of the parties to the arrangement
is voluntarily accepted by all the members and the same is
acknowledged under the very document. One more requisite
condition for a family arrangement is that each party to the
agreement should recognize the right of other members, as
they had previously asserted it, to the portions allotted to
them respectively.
22.    Muni Anjanappa is not a party to Ex.P-20. He does
not acknowledge defendant No.1’s right in all the suit schedule
properties.        Under Ex.P-20, even otherwise, plaintiff and
defendant No.1 are shown to have resolved and have agreed
to equally share the suit schedule properties. These significant
details needs to be meticulously examined in the light of the
principles laid down by the Hon’ble Apex Court in the case of
Ramgopal vs. Tulshi Ram and Others1, wherein it has been
“1. It is possible to make a family settlement
deed verbally.
2. If the decision is taken verbally and there is
no    written   record  then   there  is  no  need   for
registration.
3. If it could have been made verbally but was
reduced to the form of a “document”, registration is
required (when the value exceeds Rs.100).
4. Whether the words have been “reduced to the
form of a document” in each case is a matter of reality
that must be decided based on the meaning and
phraseology    of   the  writing,  as   well   as   the
circumstances and intent for which it was written.”
23.   In the present case on hand, under Ex.P-20,
plaintiff and defendant No.1 have resolved to share equally
and the said agreement is reduced into writing. If the parties
have reduced the family agreement into writing with an
intention of using that writing as an evidence of what they
have negotiated and when the arrangement is brought on by
the   document     alone,   then  the   said  document      requires
registration in terms of Section 17(1) of the Registration Act.
24.   In the light of the above said discussion, the
document vide Ex.P-20 cannot be looked into on two counts.
The document does not indicate that it is in the nature of
family arrangement. The document does not indicate that all
the family members have participated and therefore, the
document    is  inadmissible   in  evidence.     Secondly,  the
agreement is sought to be reduced into writing and therefore,
it compulsorily requires registration. Ex.P-20 does not record
previously negotiated terms but what can be gathered is under
the document, plaintiff and defendant No.1 have agreed to
take equal share and therefore, it is not a family arrangement
but it amounts to a partition deed during the pendency of the
suit and therefore, the said document requires registration and
is subject to payment of stamp duty.       The Appellate Court
erred in relying on Ex.P20 to hold that properties held by
defendant No.1 are also joint family properties.
25.  The Appellate Court has virtually misread the
evidence on record.     Its finding recorded under Ex.P-20 is
found to be palpably erroneous.       The Appellate Court has
interpreted Ex.P-20 with several dimensions.      The Appellate
Court refers Ex.P-20 as a family settlement and therefore, has
come to conclusion that it does not require registration. Based
on the very same document vide Ex.P-20, the Appellate Court
has come to conclusion that due execution of Ex.P-20 is
proved wherein it clearly stands established that defendant
No.1 has agreed to give half share in all the suit schedule
properties. The Appellate Court has relied on Ex.P-20 to also
come to conclusion that the other properties are also joint
family ancestral properties as defendant No.1 has agreed to
give half share. It is in this background, this Court would find
that the reasons assigned by the Appellate Court while
interpreting Ex.P-20 are found to be oscillating. Therefore, for
the reasons stated supra, this Court is of the view that
Ex.P-20 has no evidentiary value and this aspect was rightly
dealt by the Trial Court. Therefore, the findings recorded by
the Appellate Court on Ex.P-20 are not at all sustainable and
therefore, the reversal of decree at the hands of the Appellate
Court is palpably erroneous.
26.  If Ex.P-20 is discarded, this Court has to examine
whether original plaintiff and the present plaintiff have
succeeded in producing tangible evidence indicating the
existence of nucleus and also surplus income. On perusal of
the averments, this Court is of the view that there is lot of
ambiguity and vagueness in the pleadings. All that is stated in
paras 2 and 3 of the plaint is that plaintiff and defendants
constituted a Hindu Undivided Joint Family and that they are
in joint enjoyment over the suit schedule properties. At para
3, plaintiff claim that the family owned some immovable
properties, while few were acquired with the aid of joint family
funds.   At para 3, plaintiff has also specifically pleaded that
defendant No.1 is the eldest son and was managing the affairs
of the joint family. It is trite law that there is a presumption
in regard to existence of joint family but such a presumption
cannot be extended to the properties held by the family
members.      If the Trial Court judgment is looked into, this
Court is of the view that the Trial Court has dealt with the
matter in detail to ascertain the nature of the properties which
are in fact claimed by the plaintiff to be joint family ancestral
27.  Item No.1 was the subject matter of litigation in
O.S.No.61/1988.     Defendant No.1 has succeeded in the said
suit  where   the   plaintiff in    the said suit entered  into
compromise admitting the title of defendant No.1 in respect of
item No.1.     Plaintiff has not produced any documents to
demonstrate that this item No.1 was joint family ancestral
property.   The material on record clearly indicates that item
No.1 was not at all joint family ancestral property. It appears
that defendant No.1 had set up a plea of adverse possession
and he succeeded by way of compromise which is evident
from Ex.D-2. Item No.2 is exclusively standing in the name of
defendant No.1 and the same is evident from the revenue
records vide Ex.P-6.     Admittedly suit is filed by the father
against the son.    Nothing prevented plaintiff from producing
the earlier record of rights to demonstrate that this is also
joint family ancestral property and the same was inherited.
There is no rebuttal evidence to counter this revenue record
28.   Now coming to item No.3, defendant No.1 has
acquired right and title on the basis of registered gift deed
vide Ex.D-6. If defendant No.1 has acquired title based on gift
deed pertaining to item No.3, same cannot attain the
character of joint family and therefore, plaintiff cannot assert
and claim share in item No.3.        Insofar as item No.4 is
concerned, defendant No.1 has purchased the said property
under registered sale deed dated 14.08.1991 vide Ex.D-4.
29.   Item Nos.5, 6 and 8 are found to be standing in the
name of defendant No.1.     No title documents are produced.
These are exclusively standing in the name of defendant No.1.
If these properties are also ancestral properties, nothing
prevented the plaintiff from producing prior revenue records
indicating that these properties were standing in the name of
30. Insofar as item Nos.10 and 11, defendant No.1’s
name is mutated to the revenue records only on a vardhi. No
title documents are produced. Even if title documents are not
produced by defendant No.1, the initial burden was always on
the plaintiff to prove that these items which are exclusively
standing in the name of defendant No.1 were ancestral
properties. Even in absence of title documents, plaintiff ought
to have produced the earlier revenue records atleast to
demonstrate that these properties were owned and were
standing in the name of the ancestors of plaintiff and
defendants. In absence of clinching evidence, the above said
items cannot be held to be joint family ancestral properties.
There is not even a slender evidence to indicate that these
properties are also joint family ancestral properties.
31.  If the above said significant details are taken into
consideration, the next point that needs to be examined is
whether the father can assert and claim share in the
properties held by his son. This Court has to also look into as
to whether the original plaintiff Muni Anjanappa has laid a
foundation in the plaint and strong evidence is let in to
substantiate the said claim.    Admittedly, item No.9 is a dry
land measuring 4 acres 29 guntas. The original plaintiff has
not pleaded as to what was the income generated from the
said land.   To render the property joint, the plaintiff must
plead and prove that family possessed some property which
generated surplus income.      Therefore, the initial burden is
always on the plaintiff to establish that family possessed some
joint property which, from its nature and relative value formed
a nucleus and the said land was generating surplus income. It
is only then the burden shifts on the party alleging self
acquisition to establish affirmative, that the suit schedule
properties were acquired without the aid of the joint family. It
is trite law that such a presumption would not arise, if the
nucleus is such that with its help, the property claimed to be
joint could have been acquired.      This Court would also find
that there is absolutely no material indicating that defendant
No.1 was acting as a Kartha and therefore, had access to the
income generated from the joint family property.          In the
present case on hand, the original plaintiff has failed to
discharge the burden of proving that apart from item No.9, all
other properties standing in the name of defendant No.1 were
acquired out of joint family funds.
32.  Therefore, the findings of the Appellate Court in
recording a finding that the above said items are also
ancestral properties is perverse and in absence of clinching
evidence. All these significant details are not examined by the
Appellate Court. The Appellate Court erred in not taking note
of the fact that plaintiff failed to discharge the initial burden.
The findings of the Trial Court is based on rebuttal evidence.
Therefore, the Appellate Court erred in reversing the judgment
and decree of the Trial Court by placing reliance on Ex.P-20.
The judgment and decree of the Appellate Court suffers from
serious infirmities and also illegality.     The finding of the
Appellate Court that in terms of Ex.P-20, plaintiff is entitled to
half share suffers from perversity and therefore, substantial
question of law formulated by this Court is liable to be
answered in the affirmative.      The Appellate Court erred in
placing reliance    on Ex.P-20     which does   not carry any
evidentiary value.
15.10.2009    passed   in  R.A.No.70/2008    is set
aside.    Consequently, the judgment and decree
dated   29.11.2007    passed    in O.S.No.29/2006
stands restored.
