1.    In the present PIL petition filed under Article 226 of
the Constitution of India, the petitioner prays for the
following substantive reliefs:
“(a) this Hon’ble court may be pleased to call for the
records and proceedings of Intimation of Disapproval
dt. 10.09.2008 in respect of C.S. No.1896 of Byculla
Division and after perusal of the same the Impugned
illegal Order dt. 06.03.2009 passed by the
Commissioner of the Respondent No.1 may be
quashed and set aside and the Respondent may be
directed to implement the Order dt. 31.01.2009
passed by Dy. Municipal Commissioner (Zone-1) of the
(b) that the Respondent No.5 may be directed to
vacate the office premises constructed by the
Respondent No.5 in place of the godown on C.S.
No.1896 of Byculla Division and handover the
possession of the same to the Respondent No.3 for the
purpose of activities of its hospital.”
2.    Before proceeding further, we must place on record
the order dated 24/03/2015 passed by this Court (Coram :
A.S. Oka & A.P. Bhangale, JJ.) while issuing rule. The said
order reads thus :
“. Heard learned counsel appearing for the Petitioner,
learned senior counsel appearing for the Respondent
Nos. 1 to 3 and the learned senior counsel for the
Respondent Nos. 5 and 6 as well as learned AGP
appearing for the Respondent No.4.
2. Prima facie it appears to us that the transfer
effected in favour of the fifth Respondent is illegal.
3. Hence, we issue Rule.
4. All concerned advocates on record appearing today
waive service for the respective Respondents.
5. Prayer clause (b) is of very drastic nature.
Therefore, interim relief in terms of prayer clause (b)
cannot be granted in the facts of the case.
6. However, till the disposal of the Petition, the fifth
Respondent shall not create any third party rights, in
respect of the premises in question without prior
permission of this Court.
7. Hearing of this petition is expedited.
8. The issue of locus of the Petition is kept open. We
make it clear that even if there is some doubt about
locus of the petitioner, this Public Interest Litigation
deserves to be entertained as a suo motto Petition.”
3.    It is pertinent to note that on 21/03/2022, the PIL
petitioner was duly represented by his advocate. Though
the PIL petition was specifically fixed for hearing on
11/07/2022 at 2.30 p.m., none appeared on behalf of the
petitioner.   The matter was listed on 14/07/2022 at 2.30
p.m. In view of the observations of this Court in paragraph
8 of the order dated 24/03/2015, we entertained this PIL
petition as a suo motu petition.       Accordingly, Shri Aseem
Naphade was requested to assist this Court as an amicus
curiae which he graciously agreed. The hearing of the PIL
petition thereafter proceeded.
4.    The facts of the case in brief are stated hereafter. The
respondent no. 6-Hindutan Spinning & Weaving Mills Ltd.
was the owner of the land bearing CTS Nos. 1896 and
1/1896 (hereafter “the said land”, for short) with two
godown buildings constructed thereon situated at Byculla
development plan for Byculla Division was released in 1981,
wherein the said land admeasuring 1558.92 sq.mts was
reserved for extension of Nair Hospital.     The development
plan was for the year 1981-2000.           On 22/02/1990, a
notification came to be issued under section 126(2) and
126(4) of Maharashtra Regional Town Planning Act, 1966
(hereafter referred to as “MRTP Act, for short) read with
section 6 of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894 for acquisition of
the said land for a public purpose for which the land was
reserved i.e. extension of Nair Hospital.       An award was
passed     by  the   Special  Land    Acquisition  Officer     on
19/10/1992        determining     the      compensation        of
Rs.2,51,51,009/-     for   acquisition   of   the   land.     On
23/11/1992, the possession of the acquired land was taken.
Thereafter, the possession of the acquired land was given to
the representative of “E” ward of respondent no. 1-
Municipal    Corporation   of  Greater    Mumbai    (hereafter,
“MCGM”, for short) on 27/11/1992 for development and
maintenance.     The record reveals that one Nalini M. Amin
was in occupation of godown nos. 4 and 5 (admeasuring
6712 sq.ft.) at Lal Chimney Compound which is adjacent
and/or forms part of the Nair Hospital compound.            The
godowns of Nalini were required for constructing a hostel
for nurses. Nalini was therefore, according to MCGM,
entitled to permanent alternate accommodation as a project
affected person.   On record is an agreement of tenement
dated 14/06/1996. By this agreement, Nalini accepted the
terms and conditions that she was permitted to occupy the
said godowns on leave and licence basis. Clause 5 of the
said agreement stipulates that MCGM will be entitled to
terminate the license at any time by giving Nalini one week
prior notice in writing.   Clause 6 contains a covenant that
the said godown is given to Nalini for her own use. Nalini
undertook not to allow any other person to use and occupy
the said room or any part thereof without the prior
permission of the MCGM. It is provided that in case of any
breach of provision of Clause 6, Nalini shall be liable to be
ejected summarily.     Clause 7 contains a covenant that if
Nalini fails to vacate the godown on the termination of a
license, the MCGM or any competent municipal officer or
servant shall be entitled to re-enter the room without being
responsible for any loss or damage.
5.    MCGM by a communication dated 16/05/1996 offered
alternate accommodation to Nalini in lieu of her Lal
Chimney     compound     premises  to  the  extent   an    area
admeasuring 4914 sq.ft in a part of the godown on the said
land on various terms and conditions set out therein. Clause
2 of the said communication allowed Nalini to construct a
portion wall on the part of the godown on an area
admeasuring 4914 sq.ft allotted to her. Clause 7 of the said
letter stipulates that Nalini shall not be allowed to sell or
transfer or sublet or part with the area allotted to her
without    prior  written  permission   from   the  Municipal
Commissioner. An undertaking was to be submitted by her,
which she did, by virtue of a document called agreement of
6.    From 1996 to 2007, Nalini was in occupation of the
premises.     Nalini executed a document called “Deed of
Assignment of Tenancy” dated 31/12/2007 in favour of
Rubberwala Developers Pvt. Ltd i.e. respondent no. 5
(hereafter referred to as “the developer”, for short).     The
assignment proceeds on the basis that Nalini is the tenant
of MCGM in respect of the godown premises and that she
has agreed to transfer the tenancy on “as is where is basis”
to the assignee. Nalini declared that she is a lawful tenant
of MCGM in respect of the said godown premises and
tenancy rights to the same are valid and subsisting.         In
consideration of the transfer of tenancy, the developer paid
a sum of Rs. 1.60 crores to Nalini being the total
consideration for release and discharge of the tenancy
rights of Nalini forever. Clause 5 of the assignment
stipulates that on execution of the assignment deed, the
developer shall use, occupy and enter upon the premises.
Nalini in terms of clause 9 of the assignment executed an
irrevocable power of attorney (hereafter referred to as
“POA”, for short) in respect of the said premises so as to
enable the developer to deal with and dispose of the
premises in such manner as the developer deems fit at his
own risk and cost. As agreed Nalini executed an irrevocable
POA dated 22/04/2008 in favour of the developer.
7.    The portion of the said land and the portion on which
the developer was in occupation was needed by Nair
Hospital for its extension. So far as the proposal for
Dharmashala at Nair Hospital is concerned, a meeting of the
officers  of   the  Municipal   Corporation  was   held     on
25/09/2003. The minutes of the meeting dated 09/10/2003
recorded that the Deputy Chief Engineer informed the
Assistant Municipal Commissioner that part of the godown
under reference was allotted to two project affected
persons. The ownership of the plot as well as the proposed
building was to vest with the MCGM and the Dean of the
Nair    Hospital   was  requested    to   prepare   a    draft
Memorandum of Understanding (hereafter “MOU”, for short)
and get it approved from the legal department. The minutes
of the meeting dated 25/03/2004 reveals, it was proposed
that 1/3 of the godown was to be allotted to project
affected persons and 2/3 was to be used for constructing a
8.    The developer applied for the DP remark of the said
land on 31/03/2008. The developer also sought line remark
for the said land. The developer made an application dated
15/05/2008 for a no objection to grant permission for
partial repairs and construction of a proposed loft in the
godown, which came to be granted by the DP department.
The developer then by the application dated 30/06/2008
addressed to the respondent no. 2- Assistant Commissioner
(Estates) applied for transfer of tenancy from Nalini in its
favour. This according to the developer was in compliance of
the provisions of the transfer policy dated 11/01/1989 of
the MCGM and in particular of Clause 7 of the allotment
letter dated 16/05/1996.
informed the Architect of the developer that the proposals
submitted for partial repairs and proposed loft on the
premises cannot be considered as per prevailing repair
policy as the structure under reference is being used as a
godown. On 05/07/2008, the developer filed an application
to MCGM submitting plans for obtaining the Intimation of
Disapproval (hereafter “IOD”, for short). On 13/08/2008, a
report was prepared by Assistant Engineer, MCGM for
change of activity from godown to IT office. A reference is
made in the report to the request of the developer as
regards the power of attorney executed by Nalini, on the
basis of which the proposal for proposed change of activity
from godown to IT office, flattening of roof, stilt for parking,
additions and alterations of the existing structure is made.
The proposal was approved by the Executive Engineer (BP)
City Ip. The Assistant Engineer (BP) City Ip also approved
the proposal on 13/08/2008 and likewise the superior
officers approved the proposals on various dates.
10. On 10/09/2008 the IOD under section 346 of the
Act, for short) came to be issued in favour of the developer.
Thereafter   an   application  came   to  be   made    by    the
developer’s architect on 18/09/2008 seeking NOC for
change of activity repair, additions and alteration of godown
premises.     A sum of Rs.16,29,550/- was paid by the
developer to MCGM towards transfer fee. A payment of Rs.
2,79,825/- and Rs. 1,950/- was made by the developer to
MCGM on 27/10/2008 as penalty for late submission of
transfer application.
11. The Administrative Officer (Estate) prepared a report
dated 05/12/2008 recording that as per the rent demand
register, the godown stands in the name of principal tenant
Nalini (M/s. Maganbhai Amin & Company). The developer
applied for transfer of godown in its name by producing
various documents including the deed of assignment.           On
20/12/2008, a legal opinion was given by the legal
department of MCGM, whereby, after referring to the
tenancy agreement and the deed of assignment, it observed
that the developer is in occupation of the godown. The legal
department opined that the application for transfer may be
processed as per the prevailing policy upon obtaining
approval from the competent authority.
12. The godown was demolished on 17/01/2009 and
18/01/2009      without   the     developer  obtaining     any
permission/CC for demolishing the godown structure.        The
Dean of Nair Hospital submitted a report on 20/01/2009
placing on record that the godown belonging to the Nair
Hospital which had been acquired as part of the extension
to the hospital in 1992, was hurriedly demolished in two
days. A stop work notice came to be issued by MCGM on
20/01/2009. The developer submitted an undertaking to the
MCGM on 29/01/2009 undertaking to demolish excess area
if constructed beyond permissible FSI shown on the
documents. The developer undertook that no compensation
will be claimed for the proposed work in respect of the
structure as and when the property is acquired by MCGM.
13.     On 31/01/2009, a meeting was held in the chamber
of D.M.C (Zone-I) in the presence of the Dean, deputy
Dean, AC-E Ward and EE-BP (City). A reference is made in
the said minutes that as the Dean, Nair Hospital was
insisting for construction of dharmashala for Nair hospital,
the entire matter is required to be reviewed in favour of the
MCGM and Nair Hospital in public interest. It was further
recorded that Nalini illegally executed POA in favour of the
developer in gross violation of tenancy condition and hence
deserves action of eviction under section 105B of MMC Act.
The AC, E-Ward was directed not to process the proposal for
transfer and refund the charges accepted for transfer, if any,
paid by the developer. The Joint Municipal Commissioner
was therefore requested: i) to cancel the tenancy of Nalini
by issuing her notice under section 105(B) of MMC Act; ii)
to issue instructions to Deputy CH. E. (BP) City to revoke
the   IOD    issued   to   the    developer;    iii)   to    direct
AC/Estates/Dy.Ch.E(BP) to restore the possession of the
premises to the Nair Hospital; and iv) to conduct enquiry
against      the     concerned        staff      of       Building
14. Thereafter, a meeting dated 10/02/2009 was held in
the chamber of Additional Municipal Commissioner in the
presence of the Member of Legislative Assembly (MLA) Mr.
Yusuf    Ambrahani,    the    developer,    Deputy      Municipal
Commissioner     and    Assistant    Municipal    Commissioner
(Estate) and Dean of Nair Hospital. The minutes of the
meeting    dated   10/02/2009     record   that   the    Assistant
Municipal   Commissioner      informed     about     the     repair
permission given to the shed by way of shifting in lieu of
acquisition of land admeasuring 6712 sq.ft at Lal Chimney
compound     meant   for  nurses’    quarters.   The     Assistant
Municipal Commissioner informed that this was not a
permanent allotment and whenever in the future, if the
premises are required for hospital expansion or for any
other purpose, possession of the same must be given back.
It is pertinent to note that application for transfer of
tenancy to the developer was not sanctioned at that point of
time and even the Development Plan Department had asked
NOC from Estate Department, which too was not issued.
From the minutes of the meeting it is seen that the
developer agreed to hand over possession of land if
required by the Corporation.      The Dean, Nair Hospital
objected as tenancy rights of the developer were in
question. The Deputy Chief Engineer informed that the
developer started the work of demolition without C.C. and
that is why stop work notice came to be issued. He further
informed that as per DP reservation, the land is reserved for
expansion of Nair hospital and is in possession of the
MCGM. Nonetheless, the Additional Municipal Commissioner
directed Deputy Ch.Eng.B.P. (City) to ensure that no
permanent structure should be erected at this plot. The
minutes further records that on compliance of conditions of
IOD of Building Proposal, CC shall be given as per law and
further directed to incorporate the following conditions in
IOD;i)    confirm laws of tenancy rights; (ii) premises if
allocated as per norms of MCGM rules and regulations then
it will be handed over back to MCGM as when required
within stipulated time as per existing policy; iii) permanent
construction shall not be allowed under any circumstances.
The matter was to be put up before the Municipal
Commissioner for taking a decision.
15.     The report of the Assistant Commissioner (Estates)
dated 11/02/2009 records that when the site was inspected
by the concerned staff on 28/01/2009, it was noticed that
the existing tenanted premises for which repairs are
proposed is found demolished. It further mentions that the
acting Dean by his note dated 20/01/2009 pointed out that
the demolition of the structure has also raised certain points
related to the redevelopment of the said plot.
16.      In the report dated 18/02/2009 prepared by the
Additional Commissioner (Western Suburb), it is mentioned
that the Deputy Chief Engineer (BP) had granted repair
permission. The developer in the garb of repair permission,
demolished the entire building and had proposed to raise a
new construction which is not correct. The note mentions
that the Additional Commissioner in accordance with the
permission granted by the Deputy Engineer (B.P.) and in
view of the IOD, recommended that the developer cannot
be permitted to carry out the repairs. It is further stated
that the permission is subject to the condition that there
should be no permanent construction put up and in case the
MCGM wants the premises in future, the same should be
handed over back to the Corporation. Subject to these
conditions, the grant of permission was recommended.
17. The     Municipal   Commissioner     vide   order    dated
06/03/2009 stated that “we have already approved for
flattening of roof along with strengthening of structure
without changing the footprint as per repair policy. Hence,
we may allow the party to go ahead with the repair as per
IOD    conditions  and    as  recommended      by   Additional
18. The Assistant Engineer (Estates) conveyed its NOC to
the Architect of the developer on 08/06/2009 to issue
Commencement Certificate for the proposed change of
activity,  repair,  additional   alteration as  per   the    plan
approved by the Executive Engineer dated 10/09/2008. On
09/06/2009, a Commencement Certificate is issued by
MCGM to the developer for change of activity from godown
to IT office.
19.     The Dean of Nair Hospital submitted a report dated
14/01/2010 referring to the minutes of meeting dated
10/02/2009, wherein it was recorded that no permanent
structure was to be erected and in future, if the premises is
required for expansion of the hospital or any other purpose,
possession of the same must be given back. It was further
recorded by the Dean that at present on the said premises
construction   activities  of   a   permanent  nature    are    in
progress by demolishing the existing shed. A request was
made to the Deputy Chief Engineer to ensure that the
construction activities may be as per the directions of the
BMC and the office of the Dean may accordingly be
informed. On 20/01/2010, the Architect of the developer
requested the MCGM to allow them to put up RCC slab in
lieu of ladi coba, which is permissible as per the repair
circular. Further, a proposal was made for rotation of
staircase and lift in view of the last approved plan.
20. Annexed to the petition is a notice issued on behalf of
the original land owner M/s. Hindustan Spinning and
Weaving Mills Ltd. (respondent no. 6) indicating that there
is illegal misuse of land purportedly reserved and acquired
for a public purpose and converted into the private property
for commercial exploitation by private individuals, by way of
an arrangement, without inviting any public bids through an
open tender process, or a public auction, as is required for
appropriate disposal of any public land.
21. On     26/08/2011    a  report   was   prepared    by    the
Administrative Officer recording that the original transfer
paper   submitted   for  transfer  of  the   tenancy    in   the
developer’s name was missing and sanctioned was sought
to prepare duplicate file papers. On 14/06/2012 a circular
came to be issued by MCGM for speeding up cases of
transfer of tenancy. A file noting dated 12/07/2012 of the
Deputy Municipal Commissioner recorded that the plan
sanctioned by the Building Proposal Department is in the
name of the developer, where the transfer has still not been
completed. A report was prepared by the Deputy Chief
Accountant of the MCGM in connection with the application
dated 30/06/2008 made by the developer for transfer,
recording    that  out   of  the   total   transfer   fees    of
Rs.31,98,000/-, a sum of Rs.16,31,500/- is paid and the
balance sum of Rs.15,66,500/- will be collected by the
Administrative Officer (Estate). On 16/03/2013 a sum of
Rs.15,66,500/- was paid by the developer to MCGM towards
transfer fee. On 18/03/2013 “agreement of tenement” was
entered into between MCGM and the developer, wherein,
the developer was permitted to occupy as a licensee of
godown nos.4 and 5, admeasuring 4914 sq. ft., the license
fee payable being Rs.11,756/- per month. On 18/03/2013,
an indenture was entered into between the developer,
MCGM and the Municipal Commissioner thereby recording
that for transfer of tenancy, the written consent of the
principal tenant is required, which the proposed transferee
is unable to produce and the necessary indemnity bond was
22. The present PIL petition was filed on 17/06/2013. A
detailed affidavit in reply came to be filed by the developer
on 28/11/2013. An affidavit in reply dated 25/11/2013 was
filed by the respondent no.6-original owner of the land. The
petitioner filed a rejoinder to the affidavit in reply filed by
the developer and respondent no. 6 sometime in December
2013. The additional affidavit in reply came to be filed by
MCGM on 07/01/2014 and 08/01/2014. Thereafter, on
12/08/2015 an affidavit in reply was filed by the MCGM
placing on record circular dated 17/12/1994 for fees
pertaining to transfer of tenement and circular dated
05/01/1995 for charging penalty for late submission of the
application. On 24/08/2015, a letter was addressed by the
the developer’s architect to the Chief Engineer submitting
the completion certificate in connection with the change of
activity from godown to IT office. On 06/10/2015 a letter
was addressed by the Executive Engineer to the developers’
architect   stating  that  the   work  completion    certificate
submitted was accepted. It is pertinent to note that on
25/02/2019 a plan was submitted by a developer to MCGM
for change of activity from IT to office building and even
NOC dated 05/03/2020 was issued by MCGM for carrying
out the work as per the amended plan submitted. Learned
senior advocate Shri Jagtiani pointed out that the developer
has not carried out any work in terms of the NOC dated
23. We have heard the amicus curiae. We have heard Mr.
Godbole for MCGM and learned senior advocate Mr. Jagtiani,
for the developer.    An attempt was made by the learned
counsel for the intervener to intervene in this PIL petition.
An additional affidavit along with documents was tendered
by the intervener.      We find that the affidavit is of no
assistance in deciding the issues which are subject matter
of the present PIL petition. We therefore reject the
intervention application.
24. We had requested the learned counsel to place their
brief written submissions on record which we reproduce
verbatim, forming part of this order as follows.
25. The respondent no. 5 has acquired the property in
question in an illegal manner.
26. The     “Deed    of    Assignment  of    Tenancy”    dated
31/12/2007 entered into between Nalini M. Amin as
Assignor and Rubberwala Developers Pvt Ltd (respondent
no.5) as transferee is illegal:
27. Nalini M. Amin was a mere license of MCGM of the
property in question under a License Agreement dated
14/06/1996. She was neither a tenant nor had dispositive
power qua the property. Under the License Agreement there
was a prohibition on selling transferring or subletting
without        prior   written permission   from  the  Municipal
Commissioner. No prior permission was obtained from
MCGM for the purported transfer.
28. Latin maxim “Nemo dat quod non habet” – No person
can convey what she does not have. In the present case,
the creation of tenancy and its transfer are both illegal.
29. Section 7 of Transfer of Property Act, 1882. Devkubai
30. The “Agreement of Tenement” dated 18/03/2013
entered        into   between   MCGM    and   Tabrez  Shaikh    of
Rubberwala Developers Pvt Ltd (respondent no. 5), is
31. The land was acquired under Section 126(2) and
126(4) of Maharashtra Regional Town Planning, 1966
(“MRTP Act”) read with Section 6 of the Land Acquisition
Act, 1894 for a public purpose viz. extension of Nair
Hospital. The land acquired for a public purpose therefore
cannot be put to private use. If it is put to private use then
a Public Interest Litigation is maintainable. Reliance is
placed on (i) Royal Orchid Hotels V/s. G. Jayaram
and (iii) Felton Fernandes V/s. Union of India5.
32. Even assuming that MCGM was allowed to deal with
this property it is settled law, that, a public body cannot
deal with its property without inviting bids and conducing an
auction. Reliance is placed on MI Builders V/s. Radhey
Shyam Sahu6 and (ii) Sterling Computers V/s. M/s.
33. The Agreement is in respect of Godown Nos. 4 and 5
which were admittedly demolished on 17/01/2009 and
18/01/2009. No prior permission was obtained from MCGM
prior to the transfer of the purported tenancy by Nalini M.
Amin to respondent no.5. This agreement only seeks to
legitimize respondent no. 5's illegal transaction with Nalini
34. Planning permissions obtained by respondent no. 5 are
contrary to law.
35. MCGM has issued to respondent no.5 an Intimation of
Disapproval        dated 10/09/2008  and   a  Commencement
Certificate dated 09/06/2009 for change of activity from
godown to IT office. Eventually, on respondent no. 5’s
application, MCGM has also issued a permission dated
05/03/2020 for change of activity from IT to office building.
All these permissions are contrary to law.
36. The land was acquired under Section 126(2) and
126(4) of MRTP Act read with Section 6 of the Land
Acquisition Act, 1894 for a public purpose viz. extension of
Nair Hospital. The land therefore cannot be put to private
use. If it is put to private use a Public Interest Litigation is
37. In the development plan of 1981, the land is reserved
for a public purpose viz. extension of Nair Hospital. No other
construction activity can therefore be permitted.
38. Section 46 of the MRTP Act provides the planning
authority while considering an application for carrying out
construction has to have “due regard” to the development
plan. In the present case, under the development plan the
property is reserved for a public purpose viz. extension of
Nair Hospital. Reliance is placed on Nagpur Improvement
39. As per Rule 6(2)(d) of the Maharashtra Development
Rules, 1970 an application for permission to carry out
development can only be made by the owner of the land. In
the present case, it is not in dispute, that, MCGM is the
owner of the land. Neither respondent no. 5 nor its
predecessor (Nalini M Amin) even claim that they are the
owners of the land. Hence, no application for construction
could have been made by respondent no. 5.
40. Even assuming that the agreement dated 18/03/2013
between respondent no.5 and MCGM is valid, respondent
no.5 at the highest has been permitted to occupy the
godown for his own use and not permitted to carry out any
construction. Clause 6/Pg. 155 provides that the premises
are given only for use and occupation. Clause 1/Pg. 157
provides that the tenant shall not alter the premises.         No
permission is granted for using the premises for an IT office
or for construction of an office building. Despite that, MCGM
has allowed respondent no. 5 to convert the premises into
an IT office and on 05/03/2020 has permitted respondent
No. 5 to construct an office building.
41. The permission dated 05/03/2020 for constructing an
office building ought not to have been issued in light of the
order dated 24/03/2015 passed by this Hon’ble Court in the
present PIL observing that prima facie the transfer of the
property in favor of respondent no.5 was illegal.
42. A person without right, title or interest occupying a
public property and/or a property acquired for a public
purpose can be evicted under Article 226 of the Constitution
43. A public property and/or a property acquired for a
public purpose cannot be occupied by a person without any
right, title or interest. Such a person can be evicted by the
High Court under Article 226 of the Constitution. Reliance is
placed on Bombay Flying Club V/s. Airport Authority of
India9 and Dina Nath V/s. State of Uttar Pradesh10.
44.     The Nair Hospital and Topiwala Medical College is a
Municipal Hospital and reservation for its expansion was
provided in various development plans from the year 1967.
A plot of land bearing C.S.No. 5/1887 and 7/1887 of plot
area admeasuring 1953.19 sq.mtrs. called as Lal Chimney
Compound was acquired by award dated 24/02/1968 and
Municipal      tenants’     Demand    Register  shows     that    38
tenements occupied by 38 existing tenants including
Naliniben Amin, Proprietor of M/s. Maganbhai Amin and Co.
were accepted as Municipal Tenants.
45. 19/10/1992 – Land owned by Hindustan Spinning and
Weaving Mills Ltd. bearing C.S. No.1896 and 1/1896 totally
admeasuring          1558.92   sq.mtrs.   was    acquired     under
Maharashtra         Regional  and    Town   Planning   Act,    1966
(hereafter “MRTP Act”, for short) for expansion of Nair
Hospital, award was passed and possession was taken over
on 23/11/1992.
46. 1996– Since the Lal Chimney Compound area was to
be utilized for construction of residential quarters for
Nurses, the occupants of structures were required to be
shifted. Hence, Naliniben Amin was allotted alternate
accommodation at part of Godown of Hindustan Mills with
permission to carve out 4914 sq.ft. from existing acquired
MCGM      Godwon    and    allotment   letter   was   issued     on
16/05/1996      (Exhibit-A,   Page-20   in  the   PIL   Petition).
Tenement Agreement as Licensee was also executed.
47. The other dates and events as indicated in the LOD
submitted by the learned amicus curiae is not disputed.
48. Out of acquired land of Hindustan Mills only around
1/3rd portion is occupied by the 5th respondent and the
remaining area is being used for Nair Hospital for storing its
record and unused machineries. Photos of the Godown,
recently renovated are annexed at Annexure-3 to the Note
of brief submissions tender during course of argument.
49. The contention of the petitioners that the then DMC
Zone-1 passed an order dated 31/01/2009 (Exhibit-J to PIL
Petition) is factually incorrect.  It is only a report seeking
directions from the then Joint Municipal Commissioner (I) /
Assistant Municipal Commissioner (W.S.)/ M.C. on the four
proposals. This was followed by the AMC (WS) considering
the various aspects in a meeting dated 10/02/2009
attended by various persons including DMC (Zone-1) and
Dean,     Nair   Hospital   wherein    the    representative     of
respondent     no.5   specifically agreed     to  handover      the
possession of land if required by the Corporation. The then
Dean of the Nair Hospital objected to the grant of tenancy
rights to respondent no.5. Hence, the then AMC (WS)
issued the directions incorporating a specific condition that
if premises are allocated, respondent no.5 will handover the
same to BMC as and when required and no permanent
construction will be allowed. This proposal was submitted
for approval by the then Municipal Commissioner vide Note/
Sheet dated 18/02/2009 (Exhibit-M, Page -53-54). Even
the then Municipal Commissioner’s approval specifically
incorporates the aforesaid conditions (Exhibit-O, Page-55).
50. In the affidavits filed in this Court also it is reiterated
that the entire land and structure must be returned to
MCGM as and when required for expansion of Nair Hospital
by the licensee. Page-172. Even the latest affidavit of Mr.
Amol M. Chaunpurge, A.E. (B.P) reiterates the stand of the
Corporation      even   in  the   additional affidavit    dated
29/08/2022 of Mr. Pravin Rathi, Dean (At pages-308-312),
it is specifically stated in paragraphs 3(f) and 3(h) and in
Para 4 that the condition that the respondent no.5 must
handover the possession of the property without claiming
any    compensation      or  any  other   benefit  is   already
incorporated and as and when the property is required for
the Corporation, the same would be taken over. The fact
that a proposal for expansion of Nair Hospital has been
approved by Standing Committee Resolution No.33 dated
07/03/2022 and Work Order for Phase-I has been issued on
05/07/2022 has also been stated in the affidavit.
51. Section 92 of the Mumbai Municipal Corporation Act,
1988 (hereafter “MMC Act”, for short) deals with the
disposal of Municipal property. However, in the present case
there is no disposal of the property since proviso to Section
92(a) specifically excludes contracts for monthly tenancy.
In this case, an undertaking is already obtained from
respondent no.5 – Licensee – that as and when the
Corporation requires the property for its purpose, the same
would be handed-over. It is, therefore, submitted that in
the present case there is no disposal of public property nor
is it the case where the acquired property is not proposed
to be used for the public purpose.
52. Hence, it is not a case where the municipal property is
being permanently divested and according to the stage of
the construction, the concerned property will be used by
taking it back from respondent no.5 as per his undertaking
and MC’s impugned order when Phase-3 of the Project is
53. The contention of the Petitioner that the transfer is
illegal and that the grant of building permission is illegal is
also   not  correct.  During   the   course   of hearing     on
29/09/2022 the copies of the Repair Policy and Transfer
Policy of MCGM have been submitted along with the Note.
The relevant portion marked thereof is as under :-
of MCGM passed ICR No.600 regarding Transfer
Policy of Municipal Tenements excluding those
built under slum clearance scheme with
Government Aid. The said Resolution was to be
confirmed by the General Body of the
Corporation.    The     said    ICR   No.      600
recommended that in so far as the properties
acquired for specific public purpose are
concerned, no transfer be permitted except by
inheritance. In respect of the Staff Quarters and
Tenements under eviction action also no transfer
of any kind was to be permitted. In cases not
covered by the above transfers were permitted,
if the claimant had came in possession prior to
31.12.1972, certain other recommendations
were also made by the Sub-Committee of the
approved the various recommendations of the
2. The Municipal Commissioner wrote a letter
bearing No. MDG/3041/(Est. 24442 – AC) dated
3.3.1978 which seems to have been addressed
to the Municipal Secretary for being placed
before the Improvements Committee and the
Corporation. This letter deals with the letter
from K.B. Thanekar, Municipal Councillor dated
25.11.1976. The letters incorporates the
transfer policy accepted by ICR No. 600 dated
25.2.1975 and quotes therefrom. Para 6 of this
letter is important whereby the Commissioner
has proposed rules for transfer of tenements
other than staff quarters or of service quarters
in the municipal properties.
Committee of MCGM passed ICR No. 649
recommending to the Corporation that in
continuation of I.C.R. No. 600 dated 25.2.1975,
that, in supersession of the recommendations
contained under ICR No. 611 dated 1.2.1974
and 600 dated 25.2.1975, sanction be given to
the revised policy of transfer of tenements in the
municipal properties other than staff quarters
and service quarters as envisaged in para 6 of
the Commissioner’s aforesaid report (letter
dated 3.3.1978) and recommended to sanction
the revised Policy.
4. 7.08.1980 – The General Body of MCGM
passed CR No. 661 regarding the Transfer of
Municipal Tenements. The Transfer Policy as
recommended by the Municipal Commissioner in
para 6 of letter dated 3.3.1978 as recommended
by ICR No. 649 dated 14th March, 1978 was
approved.
5. 18.03.1987 – ICR No. 683 was passed in respect
of premiums to be charged for transfer (copy not
6. 28.09.1987 – CR No. 544 was passed in respect
of premiums to be charged for transfer (copy not
7. 02..02.1988 – ICR No. 568 was passed in respect
of premiums to be charged for transfer (copy not
8. 22nd July, 1988 – CR No. 241 was passed and
sanction was granted for modification of the policy
fixed by CR No. 661 dated 07th August, 1980 and the
Fees for transfer were revised.
MCGM has prepared a policy for repairs and
scrutiny of repairs proposals which is at Exhibit-H to
the Affidavit of Respondent No. 5 at Pages – 120-
129. The said Policy provides that tenantable repairs
shall not include flattening of roof or repairing roof
with different materials. Chapter-3 of the Policy
contained guidelines for proposals of raising of roofs
and sub-clause-4 provides for flattening of roof
(Except Ground Floor Structure).          The clauses
provides that the existing pitched roof with habitable
floor heights can be allowed to be flattened with a
slope of 1:10 and minimum heights at eaves level
(height at ridge level gets reduced). Chapter-II
provides for scrutiny of proposals for repairs and
provides that the proposals shall be broadly
categories in two categories viz. (i) partial repairs
(less than 75%) and (ii) extensive repairs amounting
to reconstruction (100% repairs). All partial repairs
proposals are to be approved by the Executive
Engineer. However, approval of Chief Engineer (D.P)
or Director (E.S.& P) is required for allowing extensive
repairs. Some Circulars are part of Repair Policy and
the relevant Circulars are as under ;
1) Circular No. CE/15092/I dt. 8.9.1984, contains
the policy for grant of repair permission for existing
unauthorized structures of tolerated category by
Ward Offices for unauthorized Structures prior to
1.4.1962 and residential structures prior to
17.4.1964. Para 1 deals with the scope and states
that it will not be applicable to the proposals
attracting the provisions of Section 337 and 342 of
the BMC Act, 1888. Sub clause (iii) of para 1
states that the request for tenantable repair to the
existing ground floor structures mentioned in the
above category on reservations and those affected
by sanctioned/proposed regular line, provided the
same are not forming buttoned can be considered
by Zonal Dy. Municipal Commissioner.
2) Circular No. CHE/5745/DP/BP of 17.11.1990
deals with flattening of pitch roof, (M.T. roof/A.C.
sheet roof) by Ladi Coba roof over old multistoried
building of island city. Para 2 provides that flat
terrace roof in place of pitch roof will not be
allowed and insisted the pitched roof will be
allowed to be replaced by slopping roof with
conventional materials with minimum slope of 1:10
and this can be allowed only in respect of roof of
permanent multi storied buildings and not in
respect of temporary/semi permanent single
storied sheds and such proposals are to be dealt
with in accordance with policy in their behalf.
3) Circular No.CHE/142/DPBPC of 15.5.1996
divides the buildings in two categories. Category 1
is of building neither affected by the regular line for
road widening nor by D.P. reservations. Category 2
affected by the R.L. for road widening and
reservations and where construction vertical
extension is feasible. In case of category I
extremely dilapidated and dangerous buildings
covered by DCR 33 (6) will be allowed to be
reconstructed in RCC construction on regular basis
subject to the provisions of DCR 33 (6) and NOC
from MBR&RB/ M.C.G.M. as the case may be.
Complete repairs/reconstruction will not be
permitted either in RCC or in structural steel frame
work with RCC slabs and not Ladi Coba Ladi
flooring and the reconstruction will be permitted
even with existing open spaces on site by
condoning the deficiency considering 1.5 mt. as
adequate open space by charging premium when it
is not feasible to provide 5 ft. open spaces on any
side. In respect of category 2 buildings,
reconstruction will be insisted under DCR 33 (6).
Except those buildings affected by setback of
important roads from the point of view of their
widening, in all other cases repairs in RSJ/RCC
/Slope will be allowed inclusive of setbacks with
usual registered undertaking. Repairs in RSJ and
RCC slab will be allowed on sites under reservation,
if the same is not under acquisition, subject to
submission of registered Undertaking not to claim
compensation as and when property is acquired.
After the demolition of walls of Respondent No.5,
the impugned order permits reconstruction without
changing the footprint and without consumption of
any additional FSI. Note :- In the present case,
since the proposals was for flattening of the roof of
the Ground Floor Structure, change of activity from
Godown to I.T. Office and construction of stilt, the
proposal was forwarded to C.E.D.P., who approved
the same on 18.08.2008 which was further
approved by the Director (E.S.&P) on 20.08.2008.
The draft plan was part of the proposal, only
thereafter, IOD was issued on 10th September,
2008. (The proposal is at Pages-34-39). On 10 th
September, 2008 – IOD was granted whereby the
draft plan was approved. The IOD is at Pages –
40-44 and the draft plan which was approved along
with IOD is at Page -39 of compilation No.2 of
Respondent No.5 and Page – 1 to 8 of compilation
No.3 of Respondent No.5.
This contemplated flattening of roof construction
of stilt with RCC slab, construction of a staircase
and internal lift to approach the First Floor, change
of activity from existing Godown to I.T. Office,
construction of stilt, car parking and additions
alterations full light lobby, toilet etc. Thereafter, on
06th    March,     2009,    the     Hon’ble    Municipal
Commissioner passed the order permitting to go
ahead with the work of repairs as per IOD. On
15.02.2010, pursuant to the order, Commencement
Certificate was issued sanctioning the plan which
had a minor change as compare to draft plan
whereby instead of ladi-coba slab of stilt floor RCC
slab was provided and orientation of lift and
staircase     changed.      Pages – 9 and 10 of
compilation No.3 of Respondent No.5. Thereafter,
on 06th October, 2015, the MCGM issued
Occupation Certificate subject to payment of
penalty of Rs.68,500/- for occupying the premises
without prior permission of Estate Department.
Thereafter, on 06.10.2015, the Work Completion
Certificate    submitted      by     Architect/L.S.     of
Respondent No.5 was accepted by MCGM. Exhibit-
B, Page – 270-272 by Additional Affidavit of Amol
Chaunpurge of BMC. Thereafter, on 05 th March,
2020, MCGM granted permission for change of
activity from I.T. Office to Business Office. It is
thus, submitted that the Transfer Policy sanctioned
by CR No.661 dated 7.08.1980, which permitted an
application for transfer being considered after the
transferee was put in possession, was applied.
Consequently, the condition in the License given to
Smt.Amin requiring obtaining of prior permission of
the Commissioner for transfer was viewed in the
light of the Transfer Policy, which provided for
condoning the breach subject to payment of
penalty, accordingly, penalty has been recovered.
4) Thus, though, there was an unauthorized
transfer and illegal demolition; considering the
Transfer Policy & Repair Policy of BMC, Respondent
No.5 was accepted as Municipal Licensee (and not
as tenant) and construction, was allowed without
changing the footprint of original structure and
subject to the conditions in the proposal /
recommendation of AMC (W.S) and approval of the
Municipal Commissioner. Thus, it was ensured that
no equities are created in favour of Respondent
No.5 nor can be claimed. There is no allegation of
any     FSI   violations   and    while   permitting
construction a condition is imposed that permanent
construction would be raised. This condition is in
the context of nature of life given to the Licensee
and not in the context of the material used for
construction though the construction which is
permitted is of a building, that being a substitute
for a protion of the existing municipal building
(Godown acquired from Hindusthan Mills); the
Licensee has not been given any right of
permanent occupation but it is a temporary right
created by a License to occupy the premises till
MCGM requires it for use for the purpose of Nair
5) Hence, this is not a case where any proprietary
rights of the MCGM or the statutory rights of the
MCGM are compromised.         The Municipal Officers
have acted bonafide in terms of the Extant Policies
and considering absence of immediate need for
expansion of Nair Hospital at that point of time.
54. Various    Development     Plans  from   the   Year    1967
provided for reservation for expansion of Nair Hospital and
55. On 24/02/1968 vide an Award, a plot of land bearing
No.C.S.No.5/1887 and 7/1887 admeasuring 1953.19 sq.
mts. called ‘Lal Chimney Compound’ was acquired by
respondent no.1. [Para 3a/Pg.278 (R1 Reply- 29/08/2022)]
56. 38 Tenements occupied by 38 Tenants, including
Naliniben Amin, Proprietor of M/s. Maganbhai Amin & Co.,
were   accepted   as   Municipal  Tenants   at  Lal   Chimney
57. On 19/10/1992, Land owned by Hindustan Spinning
and Weaving Mills Ltd. bearing C.S. No.1896 and 1/1896
admeasuring 1558.92 sq. mts. was acquired by MCGM for
expansion of Nair Hospital. [Para 3b/Pg.278 (R1 Reply-
58. Since Lal Chimney Compound Area was to be utilized
for  construction   of  residential  quarters    for   Nurses,
occupants thereof were to be shifted. [Para 3c/Pg.278 (R1
59. Naliniben Amin was allotted alternate accommodation
at part of Godown at Hindustan Mills with permission to
carve out 4914 sq. ft. from existing Godown. [Para
60. On 16th May 1996, an Allotment Letter to Naliniben
Amin of 4914 square feet godown on the larger property.
61. Learned amicus curiae has submitted that Ms. Amin
was    therefore    entitled  to   a  permanent      alternate
accommodation as a Project Affected Person. [Sr.7 (Amicus
62. Some of the relevant clauses of the Allotment letter
“1. That you shall have to execute the Leave & License
agreement in Administrative Officer (Estates) ‘E’ ward
office.
2. That you shall construct the portion wall on the part
of Godown Hindustan Mill on an area admeasuring
4914 sq. ft. allotted to you at your expenses and or
which you shall not claim any compensation or
reduction of rent. The said work may be carried out as
per the instructions from the office of Ward Officer ‘E’
ward.
7. That you shall not be allowed to sell or transfer or
sublet for part with the area allotted to you without
prior    written    permission  from    the    Municipal
“8. That you shall abide by all the rules and
regulations, terms and conditions framed in this behalf
from time to time and in case of any breach, default
or dispute, Municipal Commissioner’s decision shall be
final and binding on the allottees and allottees shall
submit an undertaking to that effect on Rs.20/- stamp
paper duly signed before Notary.”
63. On 10th June, 1996, possession of the said premises
admeasuring 4914 sq. ft. was handed over to Naliniben
Amin on the larger property. [Ex.B/22 (Petition)].
64. On 14th June, 1996, an ‘Agreement of Tenement’
entered into between MCGM and Naliniben in connection
with 4914 sq. ft. Premises. [Ex.C/23 (Petition)].
65. On 25th September 2003, a Meeting was held between
Additional Municipal Commissioner and other officers of
respondent no.1, representatives of Nair Hospital, including
the Dean, where plans for proposed Dharamshala were
discussed    where    portions  allotted  to  Project   Affected
Persons (‘PAP’) by respondent no.1 were excluded [Ex.A-
1/100 (R5 Reply)]. representatives of Nair Hospital were
present at this meeting. The relevant excerpt of the Minutes
of Meeting state as under:
“The papers were sent to Dy.C.E.(P&D) by A.C.
(Estate) to work out the details. Dy.C.E.(P&D)
then informed A.M.C.(W.S.) that, the part of the
shed under reference has been allotted to two
P.A.P.’s by A.C.(Est.) and that Dy.M.A.(City) has
already prepared plans for the Dharamshala on
the remaining portion of land”
66. On      25th    March,   2004,    Meeting   held   between
representatives of respondent no.1 and Nair Hospital where
it was also recorded that 1/3 rd Godown had been given to
PAP and 2/3rd was to be demolished for construction of the
Representatives of Nair Hospital were present at this
“AMC (WS) inquired where the atithi gruha was
to be located and what is the status of the
property. Dean (N) informed that this property is
a godown belonging to Nair Hospital and has
been acquired as part of extension to Nair
Hospital. One third of the godown has been given
to a PAP (project affected person). It is desired
to construct an atithi gruha by demolishing the
remaining 2/3 part and constructing on it”
67. The submission of the amicus curiae that alleges fraud
or  illegality  in  the  utilization  of  the Hindustan     Mills
Compound for any use other than that of the public purpose
of Dharamshala (and the reliance on Section 46 of the MRTP
Act) is irrespective of whether the occupant/licensee is the
original PAP or a transferee. In other words, this submission
of the amicus curiae is unrelated to the identity of the
occupant/licensee of the subject premises.
68. The Minutes of Meetings noted above indicate that the
premises allotted to Ms. Amin was never, at least initially, to
be a part of the proposed Dharamshala. The suggestion that
permissions for repair and the demolition and use of the
above the godown on the land of Hindustan Compound has
defeated or frustrated the purpose of the Dharamshala is
not correct and belied by the aforesaid Minutes of Meetings.
The entire submission of the learned amicus curiae, as part
of the overall submission that respondent no. 1/Mumbai
Municipal Corporation has acted dishonestly to favour
respondent no. 5, overlooks the fundamental fact that on
the date of these Minutes of Meetings there was no
assignment by Ms. Nalini Amin to respondent no. 5 (an
event which took place about 3 years later).
69. This submission about the failure to develop the land
for a Dharamshala overlooks another aspect. The allotment
of tenements to PAPs in Hindustan Mills Compound, which
may have been acquired for the public purpose of a
Dharamshala also facilitated another important and more
immediate public purpose, viz. the vacating of occupants
from the Lal Chimney Compound that is part of or adjacent
to the main Nair Hospital building so that that available
space could be utilized to construct a Nurses Hospital. This
is an admitted position. The submissions of the Amicus
which proceed on the basis that allotting premises on
Hindustan Mills compound was illegal or tainted by fraud or
dishonesty   overlooks  the  circumstances   in  which    the
allotments on an alternative site/location were made in the
first place.
70. Thereafter, on 31/12/2007, a Deed of Assignment was
executed by Naliniben in favour of respondent no.5, which
was registered on 12/03/2008. [Ex.D/25 (Petition)].
71. On 15/05/2008, respondent no.5 made an Application
for Office Acquisition Remarks and for no objection for
partial repairs and construction of proposed loft. [Para 11g/
72. On 04/07/2008, a repair proposal submitted by
respondent no.5 was not considered by Executive Engineer
(B.P.) as the structure was a godown. [Ex.F/34 (Petition)].
73. It appears that another proposal was submitted on
05/07/2008, though the cover letter/application of the same
is dated 23/06/2008. Vide this proposal, respondent no.5
applied for proposed change of user from Godown to Office,
repairs to the structure, flattening of roof, and proposed
stilt for parking. A copy of the application cover letter was
tendered separately to Court on 22/08/2022. Thereafter,
respondent no.5 made an Application through RTI for the
documents referred to in the above application cover letter.
The RTI Application sought for and obtained all documents
in relation to the IOD bearing No. EB/3974/E/A. These are
separately compiled in Compilation termed as Compilation-
2. The process has been explained in an Affidavit dated
29/08/2022 which will be tendered with leave of the Court.
74. The said Application annexes Form 342 and 44/69
alongwith other documents. Whilst the Form does not
provide any details about the nature of the work proposed,
the same can be ascertained from the proposed plans/draft
plans      dated    10/09/2008     [Pg.1    (Compilation-3)],
01/02/2010 [Pg.9 (Compilation-3)] and 05/03/2020 [Pg.11
(Compilation-3)] which have also been obtained through the
aforementioned RTI process.
75. These plans are discussed below. In the draft plans as
also in the first approved plan [Pg.8 (Compilation-3)], there
is a denotation in the legend for demolition of the roof. It is
correct that when the demolition was carried out by
respondent no.5, in addition to the demolition of the roof,
two of the walls forming part of the subject godown were
also   demolished      [Para   5    (R5   Additional    Affidavit-
29/08/2022)]. To this extent, the demolition was not
reflected in the draft plans or approved plans. A penalty was
paid for the demolition to the extent it was undertaken
without permission [Pg.13 (Compilation-3)] [Para 5 (R5
Additional Affidavit- 29/08/2022)]. This was pursuant to a
regularization    policy   of   respondent    no.1.    However,
thereafter    respondent     No.5    obtained    a   CC     dated
09/06/2009       [Ex.O/Pg.143      (R5    Reply)]    and       has
reconstructed the said premises in a manner consistent with
the approved plans. A work Completion Certificate dated
16th August 2015 [Pg.7 (Compilation-1)] has also been
76. Section 342 of the MMC Act provides that :-
“342. Every person who shall intend—
(a) to make any addition to a building 2[or change of
existing user].
(b) to make any alteration or repairs to a building
involving the removal, alteration or re-erection of any
part of the building except tenantable repairs:
Provided that, no lowering of plinth, foundation
or floor in a building shall be permitted.
Explanation.—“ Tenantable repairs ” in this
section shall mean only,—
(i) providing guniting to the structural
member or walls ;
(ii) plastering, painting, pointing ;
(iii) changing floor tiles ;
(iv) repairing W.C., bath or washing places ;
(v) repairing or replacing drainage pipes,
taps,        manholes        and     otherfittings;
(vi) repairing or replacing sanitary water
plumbing, or electrical fitting;
(vii) replacement of roof with the same
material but, shall not include,-
(a) change in horizontal and vertical
existing dimensions of the structure;
(b) replacement or removal of any
structural members of load bearing walls;
(c) lowering of plinth, foundations or floors;
(d) addition or extension of mezzanine floor
(e) flattening of roof or repairing roof with
different material.]
(cc) to make any alteration in a building involving—
(i) the sub-division of any room in such
building so as to convert the same into two or
more separate rooms,
(ii) the conversion of any passage or space in
such building into a room or rooms, or]
(d) to remove or reconstruct any portion of a building
abutting on a street which stands within the regular
line or such street,
shall give to the Commissioner, in a form obtained for
this purpose under section 344, notice of his said
intention, specifying the position of the building in
which such work is to be executed, the nature and
extent of the intended work, [the particular part or
parts, if any, of such work which is or are intended to
be used for human habitation] [and the name of the
person whom he intends to employ to supervise its
(emphasis supplied)
77. Therefore, Section 342, which deals with Repairs, in
Sub Section (b) also contemplates ‘alterations or repairs’ as
involving ‘removal alteration or re-erection of a part of a
building’. This provision forms no part of the Learned
amicus curiae’s submissions. The proposed plans leave no
manner of doubt that the work contemplated was more
than just mere ‘tenantable’ repairs and that is why recourse
was taken to this provision.
78. Importantly, the Form under which the application was
made was also under Section 44 and Section 69 of the
MRTP Act. These provisions read as follows:
"44. (1) Except as otherwise provided by rules
made in this behalf, any person not being Central
or State Government or local authority intending
to carry out any development on any land shall
make an application in writing to the Planning
Authority for permission in such form and
containing such particulars and accompanied by
such documents, as maybe prescribed:
Provided that, save as otherwise provided in any
law, or any rules, regulations or by-laws made
under any law for the time being in force, no
such permission shall be necessary for
demolition of an existing structure, erection or
building or part thereof, incompliance of a
statutory notice from a Planning Authority or a
Housing and Area Development Board, the
Bombay Repairs and Reconstruction Board or the
Bombay Slum Improvement Board established
under the Maharashtra Housing and Area
(2) Without prejudice to the provisions of sub-
section (1) or any other provisions of this Act,
any person intending to execute 3[an Integrated
Township Project] on any land, may make an
application to the State Government, and on
receipt of such application the State Government
may, after making such inquiry as it may deem
fit in that behalf, grant such permission and
declare such project to be 1[an Integrated
Township Project]by notification in the Official
Gazette or, reject the application.]”
“69. (1) On or after the date on which a
declaration of intention to make a scheme is
published in the Official Gazette—
(a) no person shall within the area included
in the scheme, institute or change the use of any
land or building or carry out any development,
unless such person has applied for and obtained
the necessary permission which shall be
contained in a commencement certificate granted
by the Planning Authority in the prescribed form;
(b) the Planning Authority on receipt of
such application shall at once furnish the
applicant with a written acknowledgment of its
(i) in the case of a Planning Authority other
than a municipal corporation after inquiry and
where an Arbitrator has been appointed in
respect of a draft scheme after obtaining his
(ii) in the case of a municipal corporation,
after inquiry, may either grant or refuse such
certificate, or grant it subject to such conditions
as the Planning Authority may, with the previous
approval of the State Government thinks fit to
(2) If a municipal corporation gives
permission under clause (b) of sub-section (1), it
shall inform the Arbitrator accordingly, and shall
send him a copy of the plan:
Provided that, a municipal corporation shall not
grant a commencement certificate for any
purpose which is in conflict with the provisions of
the draft scheme, unless the corporation first
obtains concurrence of the Arbitrator for the
necessary change in the proposal of the draft
(3) If a Planning Authority communicates no
decision      to   the    applicant   within     two
months from the date of such acknowledgment,
the applicant shall be deemed to have been
granted such certificate.
(4) If any person contravenes the provisions
contained in clause (a) or clause (b)of sub-
section (1), the Planning Authority may direct
such person by notice in writing to stop any
development in progress, and after making
inquiry in the prescribed manner, remove, pull
down or alter any building or other development
or restore the land in respect of which such
contravention is made to its original condition.
(5) Any expense incurred by the Planning
Authority under sub-section (4) shall be a sum
due to the Planning Authority under this Act from
the person in default or the owner of the plot.
(6) The provisions of Chapter IV shall, mutatis
mutandis        apply       in     relation        to
the development and use of land included in a
town     planning      scheme      in     so      far
as they are not inconsistent with the provisions
of the Chapter.]
(7) The restrictions imposed by this section shall
cease to operate in the event of the State
Government refusing to sanction the draft
scheme or the final scheme or in the event of the
withdrawal of the scheme under section 87 or in
the event of the declaration lapsing under sub-
section (2) of section 61.”
79. The scope of these provisions, which when applied to
the application made by respondent no. 5, is to be
understood with the meaning of ‘development’ in Section
2(7) of the MRTP Act, which reads as under:
“(7) “development” with its grammatical variations
means the carrying out of buldings, engineering,
mining or other operations in or over or under, land or
the making of any material change, in any building or
land or in the use of any building or land 4[or any
material or structural change in any heritage building
or its precinct] 5[and includes6[demolition of any
existing building, structure or erection or part of such
building structure of erection; and] 7[reclamation,]
redevelopment and lay-out and sub-division of any
land; and “ to develop” shall be construed
accordingly];”
80. Further, under the Repair Policies and Scrutiny of
Repairs Proposals (“the Repair Policy”) issued by the MCGM
a.     Tenantable repairs require no permission of
the MCGM.
b.     For repairs other than tenantable repairs,
Chapter II of the Repair Policy applies which deals
with scrutiny of Proposals for Repairs.
c. Under Chapter II of the Repairs Policy, proposal
for Repairs are categorized into (i) Partial Repairs
(less   than   75%) and      (ii) Extensive Repairs
amounting to reconstruction (100% repairs).
81. Some of the relevant clauses of the Repair Policy are
(1) Reporting for approval:
The proposal shall be broadly categorized in two
categories (i) Partial Repairs (less than 75%) and
(ii)Extensive     repairs   amounting   to  reconstruction
(100% repairs).
Existing FSI allowed with existing plinth.
All  partial    repair   proposals   to  be  approved     by
Approval     to   be   sent   to Ch.E.(D.P.)/  Dir.  (E.S.&
a. Allowing extensive repairs
b. Condoning deficiency in open space
c. Any other concessions as the case may be.
82. As mentioned above, under Chapter II of the Repairs
Policy [Ex.H/120 (R5 Reply)], proposal for ‘Repairs’ are
categorized into (i) Partial Repairs (less than 75%) and (ii)
Extensive Repairs     amounting to      reconstruction (100%
repairs). Therefore, it is clear that under the Repairs Policy,
Repairs     also   include     instances    where     complete
reconstruction would be required. The only requirement for
an Extensive Repairs amounting to reconstruction is that
the same has to be sent for approval to Chief Engineer
(D.P.)/ Director (E.S & P).Whereas for other partial repairs,
the proposal is to be sent to Executive Engineer for
83. The very making of the application and the proposed
plan/draft plan submitted by respondent no. 5 is an
indication of the fact that the work contemplated or
proposed in the godown was beyond mere repairs or
tenantable repairs. These provisions are intended to cover
more expansive work, be it alterations, re-erection, removal
and demolition too. It also covers a change of user.
84. The suggestion in the PIL [Para 14/Pg.7 (PIL)] and the
arguments      of  Learned     Amicus    in  relying   on     the
nomenclature of the application as being ‘for repairs’, is
based on a misreading of the aforementioned statutory
provisions, the repair policy and the documents on record or
that are of matter of record.
85. On 13/08/2008, the Assistant Engineer (B.P.) City IV
of respondent no.1 passed an Order approving proposal of
respondent no.5 for change of activity from Godown to I.T.
Office and approving further proposed work of internal
additions and alterations, construction of stilt parking for
car parking, flattening of roof, etc. [Ex.G/35]. The said
Order was approved / endorsed by the following Officers on
the following dates:
86. The said Order provided, inter alia, that :-
“1… Architect has submitted the proposal for
proposed change of activity from existing Ground
floor godown to I.T. Office and additions and
alterations along with flattening of the existing
sloping roof for the property bearing C.S. No. 1896
of Byculla Division. From the papers submitted the
Architect, it is observed that the original plot and
the godown over it belongs to Asstt. Commissioner,
(Estates) of M.C.G.M. Architect has submitted
certified true copy of the letter issued by the office
of the Asstt. Commissioner (Estates) under No
Estates/1221/MC/AC dt. 16.5.1996 stating that the
premises under reference has been allotted to Smt.
Nalini Amin as an alternate accommodation in lieu
of Lal Chimney Compound Mumbai as part of the
godown and the area of the godown allotted was
4914 Sq. ft. Copy as at Pg C-47. From the above, it
is seen that the godown which has been given as
an alternate accommodation as a godown to Smt.
Nalini Amin, the Prop. Of M/s. Maganbhai Amin &
Co. is a tenanted property of M.C.G.M. Hence, the
authenticity of the premises and the user of the
premises is accepted.”
The proposal for change of activity is submitted by
M/s. Rubberwala & Co. who are Regd. Power of
Attorney holder of Smt. Nalini Amin, Prop Of M/s.
Maganbhai Amin & Co. who is the tenant of the
M.C.G.M.    As   the  property    belongs  to    Asstt.
Commissioner (Estates) N.O.C. from the Asstt
Commissioner (Estates) is necessary. As per the
practice and procedure, Estate Deptt. will issue
N.O.C. only after approval of plans by this office.
Hence submission of N.O.C. from Estate Dept. will
be incorporated as an I.O.D. condition to be
complied with before C.C.
3c.   Construction of the stilt for car parking in
the premises.
The applicant is the tenant of M.C.G.M. and the
premises is existing godown and handed over to the
applicant as an alternate accommodation. As the
plot is reserved for extension to Nair Hospital. The
M.C.G.M. can shift the tenant whenever the plot is
to be developed as an extension to the Hospital by
M.C.G.M. Hence the open space deficiency may not
be considered in this case.
As per the S.E. (Survey)’s remarks as at Pg C-1 the
plot under reference is affected by 120’0 wide A.L.
Nair Road and same is reserved for extension to
Municipal Hospital (Nair Hospital). The Architect has
proposed change of activity along with additions and
alterations to the existing structure. Further the
property under reference belongs to A.C. (Estates)
i.e., M.C.G.M. and allotted the same as an alternate
accommodation        to    the    appellant   whenever
Corporation developed the plot as an extension to
Hospital applicant has to be shifted to other location
as given by Asstt. Commissioner (Estates) therefore
necessary     Undertaking    for   not   to claim    any
compensation for the proposed work will be insisted
as an I.O.D. condition to be complied with before
In view of above, Ex. Eng. (B.P.) City-II’s approval is
1. To allow flattening of roof proposed by Architect
as explained in Point No. 3 (d) as at pg N-3
In view of above Ch. Eng. (D.P.)/Dir(E.S.&P)’s
approval is requested
1. To allow change of activity proposed by Architect
as explained in Point No. 3 (a) as at pg N-3.
2. To   allow  construction    of  stilt  proposed     by
Architect as explained in Point No. 3 (c) as at pg
87. The exercise of this power or discretion by respondent
no. 1 was consistent with the aforesaid statutory and policy
framework. At any rate, no specific argument has been
made on why the proposed grant of this permission by this
order or the file notings were not within the ambit of
applicable law. This order or file notings have been signed
and endorsed by various officers. If an argument has to be
countenanced that all of this is illegal and ‘dishonest’, this is
an allegation of not just malice in law but malice in fact.
The burden for such an allegation is very high and one that
has not been satisfied in the present case.
88. The approval in the above order/notings is also, inter
alia, to the change of user to IT office. The proposed
plans / draft plans obtained through RTI indicate the nature
of the office that was to be constructed. The relevant part
of the order of 13/08/2008, which considers and approves
the change of user reads as follows:
“3(a) change of activity:
As per the papers submitted by Architect, it is
observed that the existing user of the premises is
godown. Architect has proposed to change this activity
as I.T. Office. The premises under reference falls in the
‘R’ Zone and it is abutting to 60’0” wide Sane Guruji
Marg and 120’0” wide Dr. Anandrao L. Nair Marg. This
particular premise is having access from Dr. A.L. Nair
Marg. As per regulation 51 (xviii) of DCR 1991, the I.T.
establishment is permissible activity on the plot having
fronting on the roads with width more than 12.00 Mtr.
In the above referred case, the premises is having
access from 120’0” wide Dr. A.L. Nair Road.
Thereafter, this proposed activity of I.T. user is
permissible. As the proposed user is I.T. office,
Registration Certificate from Director of Industries as
I.T. Office shall be submitted before C.C.
Ch. Eng. (D.P)/Dir (E.S.& P.)’s approval is requested to
allow change of activity as explained above.
89. This part of the orders/report dated 13/08/2008,
though mentioned at Serial No.24 of the amicus curiae’s List
of Dates and Events, has been overlooked in the main
submissions of the amicus curiae who has contended in
paragraph no.3 / Page 3 that “…[n]o permission is granted
for using the premises as an IT office or for construction of
an office building…”
90. On 10/09/2008, IOD bearing No. EB/3974/E/A was
issued by the MCGM under Section 346 of the MMC, Act
91. Section 346 of the MMC, Act, provides that :-
“346. (1) If the Commissioner disapproves of
any building or work of which notice has been
given as aforesaid or of any portion or detail
thereof, by reason that the same will contravene
some provision of this Act or some byelaw made
hereunder at the time in force or will be unsafe,
he may, at anytime within thirty days of the
receipt of the notice or of plan, section,
description or further information, if any, called
for under section388,340 or343, as the case may
be, by a written notice intimate to the person
who gave the notice first herein before in this
section mentioned his said disapproval and the
reason for the same, and prescribed terms
subject to which the building or work may be
deemed to be approved by him.
(2) The person who gave the notice concerning
any such building or work may proceed with the
same, subject to the terms prescribed as
aforesaid but not otherwise at any time within
one year from the date of receipt by him under
sub-section (l) of the written notice in this
behalf, but not so as to contravene any of the
provisions of this Act or any bye-law made
hereunder at the time in force.”
92. Clause 17 of the IOD provides that:-
“17. That the precautionary measures to avoid
dust nuisance such as erection of G.I. sheet
screens at plot boundaries upto reasonable
height shall not be provided before demolition of
existing structures at site.”
93. Further, Clause 20 of the IOD provides that :-
“20. That the G.I Sheet screens at plot boundaries
upto adequate height to avoid dust nuisance shall not
be provided before demolition of existing building.”
(emphasis provided)
94. Therefore, it is clear that the IOD granted under
Section 346 of the MMC Act also contemplated demolition.
To suggest that these are ‘standard’ terms and conditions is
no answer to the fact that the nature of work and change of
user was separately considered by respondent no. 1 and the
IOD was issued in relation to those works.
95. On 20/01/2009, Dean of respondent no.3 addressed a
letter to respondent no.1 contending a part of the above
property had been demolished and requesting the matter be
looked into on urgent basis [Ex.I/45 (Petition)]. It was,
inter alia, claimed by the Dean of the respondent no.3 that
“This is to bring to your notice that a property
godown (previously Hindustan Mill compound)
belonging to Nair Hospital which had been acquired as
part of extension to Nair Hospital in yer 1992
measuring 1552 sq. mt. area (vide page No.7 marked
‘A’) was reported demolished hurriedly in two days on
17.1.2009 and 18.1.2009.
As per plan record available at this office at initial
stage after acquiring the said property, it was
tentatively proposed to construct Dean’s Banglow
after demolishing the Hindustan Mill Compound
godown.
Later 1/3rd of this acquired property as part of
extension of Nair Hospital was decided to be given to
a PAP (Project Affected Person) and the remaining
2/3rd was proposed for AthithiGruha (Dharma Shala)
for the patient’s relatives of Nair Hospital, as per
minutes of meeting with AMC(WS) held on
25.03.2004. (vide page 7 marked ‘C’)”
96. Petitioner had alleged on the basis of this letter,
collusion between respondent no.5 and respondent nos.1
97. It is submitted that the Dean of respondent no.3
would not have known about the applications made in
accordance with the Repairs Policy and the IOD granted to
the respondent no.5. Further, even according to the Dean of
the respondent no.3, 1/3rd of the said Property was decided
to be given to a Project Affected Person, and 2/3 rd was
proposed for Athithi Gruha.
98. Notings on the said letter of Executive Engineer (BP)
City [Pg.46] state that matter be seen personally, IOD and
ownership documents be examined carefully and Stop Work
Notice be issued till matter is clarified and put up to
99.     On 31/01/2009 [Ex.J/47 (Petition)], a meeting was
held between the representatives of respondent no.1 and
respondent no.3, where, inter alia, certain observations
were made qua the transfer and stating that Building
Proposals Department had issued IOD but not CC to allow
demolition of the said structure. In the Minutes, certain
Orders were requested for from Jt.M.C.(I)/A.M.C.(WS)/M.C.,
inter alia, requesting for cancelling tenancy of Naliniben,
revoking IOD, restoration of possession and enquiry against
certain staff.
100. It is submitted that these observations were made
without hearing the respondent no.5 and respondent no.5
was not present. The Application made as per prevailing
policy for transfer of tenancy was not noticed at this
Meeting. None of the Orders requested for in the said
Meeting came to be passed by respondent no.1.
101. Thereafter, on 10/02/2009, a Meeting was held in the
presence of the representative of respondent no.5 wherein,
inter alia, it was recorded that request for transfer of
tenancy was pending, but had not yet been sanctioned. In
this meeting, Additional Municipal Commissioner (WS)
directed Dy. Chief Engineer (B.P.) (City) to ensure no
permanent structure were erected on the plot and on
compliance with IOD, CC to be given as per law, including
two additional conditions, i.e.:
a. Premises allocated to MCGM rules and
regulations will be handed over to MCGM as
and when required as per existing policy.
b.   Permanent construction would not be
allowed under any circumstances.
102. Thereafter, on 11/02/2009 [Ex.L/52 (Petition)], the
Asstt.   Commissioner     (Estates)  of  respondent       no.1
addressed a letter to the Dy. Ch. Eng (B.P.) City and noted
the Application received for proposed change of activity,
proposed repairs, additions and alterations. It was also
noted, inter alia,
“Sub:     Sudden    demolition   of   part   structure    of
Hindustan Mill Compound acquired property of Nair
Please find enclosed herewith photocopy of note
received in this office from Ag. Dean (N&T) at page 1
alongwith other related documents at pg.3 to 11
In this case, this Office has received application from
Architect M/s Shaikh Associates for proposed change
of activity, proposed repairs, Addition, alteration to the
existing municipal tenanted structure situated at plot
bearing C.S. No.1896 of Byculla division at Dr. A.L.
Nair Road in ‘E’ ward. The Architect has submitted
certified copies of IOD and plan approved & issued by
E.E. (B.P.) City u/no. EB/3974/E/A dtd. 10/09/2008.
The proposal for NOC from this Office is still under
scrutiny.
Meanwhile, site was inspected by this office
concerned staff on 28/01/2009 when it is noticed that
the existing tenanted premises for which repairs are
proposed is found demolished.
Now, Ag. Dean (N&T) vide note at page 1 u/no.
NDN/1136 dtd. 20/01/2009 has pointed out this
demolition of structure & has also raised certain points
related to the redevelopment of the said plot.
You are therefore requested to take immediate
necessary action for demolition of the municipal
structure without obtaining C.C from your office i.e.
E.E.(B.P.) City & N.O.C. from Estate Deptt., Asstt.
Comm. ‘E’ Ward. Dean of Nair Hospital who is user
Department in present case. You are also requested
not    to   grant    any  permission/    commencement
certificate  to  the   above   proposal  unless    specific
remarks & N.O.C. are obtained by the applicant from
concerned Authorities.
You are further requested to inform Ag. Dean
(N&T) Nair Hospital about the course of action taken
by your office under intimation to this Office & other
concerned authorities please.
103. Thereafter, on 18/02/2009 [Ex.M/53 (Petition)], a
Note was issued by Additional Municipal Commissioner
(W.S.) stating that information had been received from the
Superintendent, Nair Hospital that the shed in the Hindustan
Mill  Compound,       Nair   Hospital   was   demolished       on
19/01/2009 without giving any prior notice.      It was stated
that information was obtained by the Additional Municipal
Commissioner (W.S.) from Dy. Chief Engineer, Building
Proposal, City, Shri Saste, who also ordered “Stop Work
Notice” be given to further permanent construction. It was
noted that in the meantime, after the possession holder of
the concerned shed made a representation to the Hon’ble
Commissioner in this context, the Hon’ble Commissioner
verified the actual facts and passed order that action be
taken as per the rules. It was noted that Hon’ble MLA, Shri
Yusuf Abrahani had made a request that the said land had
been acquired by M/s. Rubberwala Developers as alternative
land and they be allowed to carry out the said construction.
The Meeting of 10/02/2009 was referred to. It was noted
that it was wrong that in the name of repairs, the entire
shed had been demolished and new construction work was
started.   Thereafter,  the  Additional    Commissioner      (WS)
referred   to  starting  work   subject    to  IOD.   This    note
suggested the grant of permission to start work subject to
three conditions i.e.,
a.  repair   work   be    carried  out   in   strict
compliance with given permissions and IOD;
b. no permanent construction be carried out;
c. in the event, the premises are required
back by MCGM, the same be handed over in
accordance with law.
104. Therefore, it is submitted that even if there was
demolition without a Commencement Certificate, the same
was addressed by directions to issue a Stop Work Notice by
respondent      no.1     and      requiring     any       further
permissions/commencement         certificate   unless    specific
remarks and NOC was obtained from concerned authorities.
Further, the Note of the Additional Commissioner (WS) also
granted permission subject to IOD and on the condition of
no permanent construction, which would have to be
understood in the context of the proposal on the basis of
which the IOD had been granted. Further, it is submitted
that in any case even the precise nature of the material that
we wanted to use was the subject matter of a later
application of 2010.
105. In this light, on 6/03/2009 [Ex.N/Pg.55 (Petition)], an
Order was passed by Municipal Commissioner of respondent
no.1 allowing respondent no.5 to go ahead with repairs as
per the portion identified as ‘X’ in the minutes/report of
18/02/2009. The order of 6/03/2009 reads as under
We have already approved for flattening of roof along
with strengthening of structure without changing the
footprint as per repair policy.
Hence we may allow the party to go ahead with the
repair as per IOD conditions & as recommended by
106. The sequence of events including the reports, orders
and notings from time to time were duly considered in the
short order of 6/03/2009. This order is cognizant of the
approval   to   the  repairs   (which   would  also   include
reconstruction). It also takes into account the demolition
that was carried out without a Commencement Certificate
and therefore, reiterates the conditions stipulated in the
order of 18/02/2009 [Ex.M/Pg.53 (Petition)], as identified
as ‘X’ [Pg.54 (Petition)]. Those conditions in turn seek strict
implementation of the IOD conditions and provide for no
permanent construction.
107. Although the demolition of a part of the subject
structure was not contemplated in the proposed plans and
the demolition was done before the issuance of the CC, the
consequences for that need not have been that permissions
and approval otherwise granted for repairs or additions and
alterations as per the proposed plans are liable to be
cancelled in toto. The order of the Municipal Commissioner
therefore, seeks to give effect to the approvals already
granted as per law and as per the repair policy whilst at the
same time addressing the issues raised in the orders of
18/02/2009 [Ex.M/Pg.53 (Petition)] and 11/02/2009 [Ex.L/
108.     The   reconstruction/re-erection   of   the    subject
premises was done thereafter upon obtaining a CC, as
noted below. It is neither the case in the Petition nor the
case as argued by the amicus curiae that the premises as
constructed was contrary to the plans as approved or the
order of 13/08/2008 [Ex.G/35 (Petition)] first granting the
permission for certain additions and alterations as also for
change of user.
109.     It   is  also   nobody’s      contention   that    in   the
reconstruction    of   the   premises,     respondent   no.5     has
consumed any additional FSI or has added any areas to the
premises     beyond    the   area    that   was  allotted   to   the
predecessor of respondent no.5.
110. In light of the above facts and orders, in accordance
with the Regularization Policy of respondent no.1, on
8/06/2009, the respondent no.5 paid a penalty for the
demolition    to  the   extent   it   was    undertaken    without
permission [Pg.13 (Compilation-3)] [Para 5 (R5 Additional
111.     On    8/06/2009,     NOC     to   issue  Commencement
Certificate was issued by the Estates Department through
the Assistant Engineer Estates of the MCGM, inter alia, for
proposed repairs, addition, alteration [Ex.O/56 (Petition)].
The text of this NOC issued by the Estates Department
“… there is no objection to issue Commencement
Certificate for the above mentioned work as per the
plans approved by EEBP City under No.EB/3974/E/A
dated 10th September 2008 on following terms &
112.    The approved plans referred to in this NOC are part
of   Compilation    III  filed  by     respondent    no.5.    [Pg.1
(Compilation-3)]. These plans bear the same date as of the
113.      The Learned amicus curiae had submitted that no
NOC was obtained with regards to the work to be carried
out by respondent no.5. It is submitted that the said
submissions is contrary to the said document which gave
NOC to commence work.
114.       On 9/06/2009, Commencement Certificate was
issued by MCGM [Ex.O/143 (R5 Reply)]. Commencement
Certificate was issued under Section 347 which provides
“347. (1) No person shall commence to erect any
building or to execute any such work as is described in
(a) until he has given notice of his intention as
hereinbefore required to erect such building or
execute such work and the Commissioner has
intimated his approval of such building or work or
failed to intimate his disapproval thereof within the
period prescribed in this behalf in section
(aa) until he has given notice to municipal 2[city
engineer]     of    the    proposed     date      of
commencement. Where the commencement
does not take place within seven clear days of
the date so notified, the notice shall be deemed
not to have been given];
(b) after the expiry of the period of one year
prescribed in sections 345 and 346 respectively,
for proceeding with the same.
(2) If a person, who is entitled under section 345 or
346 to proceed with any building or work, fails so to
do within the period of one year prescribed in the said
sections, respectively, for proceeding with the same he
may at any subsequent time give afresh notice of his
intention to erect such building or execute such work,
and thereupon the provisions hereinbefore contained
shall apply as if such fresh notice were a first notice of
such person’s intention.”
115. The very existence of there being both an IOD and
CC, without any submission identifying, which if any portion
of the work was either contrary to law or contrary to the
permissions granted, is an indication that the work that was
done was properly applied for and completed. Even if the
demolition work was without a CC, that would not render
the work thereafter done pursuant to a CC as illegal or
warrant    the   serious    allegations  made    against      the
respondents. As noted below and also placed on record in
the Affidavit of respondent no. 1 dated 14/07/2022,
whenever any work was carried out or a change of user was
applied for and granted, respondent no. 1 has issued a work
completion certificate.
116. On 20/01/2010, respondent no.5 applied for changing
material from ladicobaladi to RCC and for rotation of
staircase and lift without changing footprint of structure
[Para 11r/85 (R5 Reply) Ex.Q/59 (Petition)]. It is submitted
that the same was an amendment to the approved plans.
Engineer (BP) City II made reference to Chief Engineer
(D.P.) & Director (ES&P) of respondent in respect of
respondent no.5’s proposal.
a. Serial No.1 of the proposed amendment
plans was to include rotation of staircase, lift
and Serial No.2 was proposed ladicobaladi
flooring into RCC and that the proposal does
not increase the FSI being within the footprint
of the structure.
Architect    has    proposed     rotation     of
staircase / lift with respect to last amended
plans for better planning. However, the same
will not increase F.S.I. since the same is within
the footprint of the structure. Hence, the same
can be allowed.”
b. Serial No.2 records that it will be easier to
demolish the structure without affecting rest of
the structure at the time of widening of the road.
“2.      Proposed Ladicobaladi flooring into
Architect in his representation as at Pg.C/71
has proposed to construct R.C.C. floor instead
of ladicobaladi flooring. The structure under
reference comes under Category 2 of the
repair policy i.e. affected by road setback and
reservation of extension to Nair Hospital.
However, since then M.C. has allowed repairs
to the structures on the same foot print, the
structure may be deemed to have been
considered as Category I of the repair policy.
As per category 1 (b) complete repair /
reconstruction is permissible either in R.C.C.
or in structural steel frame work with R.C.C.
slabs and not ladicobaladi flooring. Further
owner has undertaken to surrender the
portion of structure in setback without
claiming any compensation as and when road
under setback needs widening. Further,
Architect has proposed RSJ frame structure
with    R.C.C.    slab   and    also    provided
construction joint between the portion of
structure in setback and rest of the structure.
Hence, it will be easier to demolish the
structure without affecting rest of the
structure at the time of widening of road.”
118. The stamp and signatures of Dy. Ch. Eng. (B.P) City
(02/02/2010);    Ch.   Eng.   (D.P)   and   Dir.  (E.S.&     P)
(18/02/2010) are endorsed at the bottom of the page
[Pg.146 (R5 Reply)] showing that the same was approved
by the appropriate authorities under Repairs Policy for
Extensive Repairs    amounting to     reconstruction (100%
repairs). The amended approved plans reflecting these
amendments are produced at [Pg.9 (Compilation-3)].
119.   On 27/04/2015, the proposal for NOC to OC of
completed addition/alteration, flattening of roof, stilt for
parking and change of activity from Godown to IT office was
120. On 15/05/2015, an NOC to OC issued. [Ex.A/266 (R1
121. On 16/10/2015, Work Completion Certificate issued
under Section 353A of the MMC Act, which reads as follows
“[353A. (1) every person who employs a licensed
surveyor or person approved by the Commissioner to
erect a building or execute any such work as is
described in section 342,shall, within one month after
the completion of the erection of such building or the
execution of such work, deliver or send or cause to be
delivered or sent to the Commissioner at his office,
notice inwriting of such completion, accompanied by a
certificate in the form of Schedule T signed by the
person employed under section 344A,who is hereby
required immediately upon completion of the work and
upon demand by the person employing him to sign and
give such certificate to such person, and shall give to
the Commissioner all necessary facilities for the
inspection of such building or of such work: Provided
(a) such inspection shall be commenced within
seven days from the date of receipt of the notice
of completion, and
(b) the Commissioner may, within seven days
from the date of commencement of such
inspection, by written intimation addressed to
the person from whom the notice of completion

stated in such notice, or, in the absence of such
address, affixed to a conspicuous part of the
building to which such notice relates-
(i) give permission for the occupation of such

bye-laws.
(2) No person shall occupy or permit to be
occupied any such building, or use or permitted

any such work, until-
(a) the permission referred to in proviso (b) to
sub-section (1) has been received, or
(b) the Commissioner has failed for twenty-one
days after receipt of the notice of completion to
intimate as aforesaid his refusal of the said
permission].”
122. On 19/08/2017, the Licensed Surveyor had submitted
the    proposal     for regularization  for   work  of   further
addition/alteration of IT building. The same was approved.
123. On 25/02/2019, an Online submission of Application
for change from IT to Office Building. [Pg.46 (COD)].
124. On 05/03/2020, Approval granted from IT to Office
Building under Regulation 34(3.1) (3.2) (Table C) Sr. 25 of
125. This, like many others, are documents produced by
respondent no. 5 itself as part of a Compilation of
Documents (Compilation I). Contrary to the submission, at
this stage there was no further work but only a change of
user to a regular office from a previous user that was for IT.
It was allowed. Again, no provision has been cited to
contend that it was either procedurally or substantively
illegal. It is not.
126.     Also, it was contended that this approval is an
indication of the malafides of respondent nos. 1 and 5
because it was after the interim order dated 24/03/2015
passed in the above Writ Petition. This submission is
misplaced especially when one reads the interim order that
“6. However, till the disposal of the Petition, the fifth
Respondent shall not create any third-party rights, in
respect of the premises in question without prior
permission of this Court.”
127. The interim order is specifically restricted to no third-
party rights. It says nothing of change of user. This also
stands to reason because the prima facie view expressed in
the interim order has nothing to do with the aspect or issue
of repairs or the land being for a public purpose but only in
relation to the aspect of transfer of the license/tenement,
that too at a time when the policy supporting such transfers
with subsequent approvals was not on record before this
Court at that time.
128. Respondent no.1 has filed various Affidavits in this PIL
confirming that the additions and alterations that were
carried out and the change of user that was implemented in
respect of the subject premises is in accordance with law
and legal. In these Affidavits, quiet of few of the important
aspects have been referred to.
129. In fact, in the first affidavit of respondent no.1 dated
07/01/2014, and more particularly in paragraph No.1, aa
reference is made to the proposal received by respondent
no.1 from respondent no.5 on 05/07/2008 (referred to
above). The same Affidavit refers to, inter alia, the proposal
as approved by the Municipal Commissioner on 06/03/2009,
the grant of CC on 09/06/2009 and the amendment to the
approved plan on 20/01/2010 [Paras 8(g) (i) (j) (k) (R1
130. On 08/01/2014 respondent no.1 has filed another
Affidavit explaining the circumstances leading to relocation
of the tenant to the subject structure in the Hindustan Mills
Compound. This Affidavit also refers to the Application
already made by respondent no.5 for transfer of tenancy in
its favour pursuant to the executed Deed of Assignment of
Tenancy. It proceeds to record that after considering the
Application and the papers submitted, the tenancy was
transferred in the name of respondent no.5 as per the
prevailing policy of the Corporation and after following due
131. The policy applicable to transfer of residential as well
as commercial tenements was then placed on record by
respondent no.1 vide its affidavit dated 12/08/2015.
132. Thereafter, on 14/07/2022, respondent no.1 has filed
another    Affidavit  referring    to various  approvals    and
permissions that were granted including after the filing of
133. The above record and applicable legal provisions and
policies indicate that even if there was an irregularity in the
manner in which the work of repairs/reconstruction was
carried out at some point of time during the process, it has
thereafter   been    cured   or   regularized   by  orders    and
permissions issued after the act of demolishing a part of the
structure without a CC and without that part of the
demolition being reflected in the proposed plans and
approved plans. It is not correct to contend that this work
of repairs, additions, alterations and reconstruction was
without any permissions. Neither is it correct to understand
the reference to ‘repairs’ as it appears in some of the
reports / minutes / orders as being mere internal repairs.
134. Respondent no.5 has been in substantial compliance
with    the   procedural    requirement     of   submitting     an
Application with a proposed plan; obtaining approval which
is  been    endorsed    by   multiple  officers;  getting   plans
approved; obtaining an IOD; obtaining an NOC for CC;
obtaining a CC; obtaining a work Completion Certificate;
and obtaining amendments to the approved plans. For these
reason respondent no.5 submits that no action ought to be
taken in terms of the reliefs prayed for in this PIL on this
135. For all of these reasons it is respectfully submitted
that the PIL Petition is without any basis and does not
warrant the far-reaching reliefs it seeks.
136. On 11/01/1989, respondent no. 1 framed a Transfer
Policy. It applies to the transfer by persons of premises that
are owned by respondent no. 1. The application of this
Policy would be the same regardless of whether the nature
of occupation is described a ‘licensee’ or a ‘tenant’. It
applies to all transfers of premises of respondent no. 1. The
vires or legality of the Transfer Policy is not under challenge
in this PIL. This Policy is not shown to be contrary to any
mandatory provision of the MMC Act, MRTP Act, DCR 1991
or any rules applicable to respondent no. 1 in relation to
disposal of premises. The terms of the Transfer Policy are
considered below. Significantly, this Transfer Policy was not
on the record of these proceedings when a prima-facie
finding of illegality of the subject transfer was observed in
the Order dated 24/03//2015.
137.    On 19/10/1992, a larger property adjoining Nair
Hospital was acquired by the Special Land Acquisition
Officer. The said larger property was a godown admeasuring
around 15,000 square feet (the larger property). [Para 11a-
138.    Respondent no.1 was the owner of Lal Chimney
Compound. On the compound, there was an occupant
named Naliniben M. Amin” of a godown admeasuring 6712
square    feet.   The   occupant,   has    been  described     by
respondent nos. 1 and 5 as a tenant. [Para 8(c)/169 (R1
Reply    dated   08.01.14)]    respondent    no.1   wanted     to
construct a nurse’s hostel in Lal Chimney Compound.
139. Respondent no.1 shifted Naliniben M. Amin from her
godown admeasuring 6712 square feet in Lal Chimney
Compound feet and allotted to her 4914 square feet
godown in the larger property. The larger property was one
single godown admeasuring 15000 square feet. [Para 11a-
b/78 (R5 Reply)] Out of that, 4914 square feet godown was
allotted to Naliniben M. Amin as a tenant.
140. On 16/05/1996, an Allotment Letter to Naliniben
Amin of 4914 square feet godown on the larger property.
141. The amicus curiae has also sought to submit that the
Allotment to Ms. Amin was as a ‘licensee’. It was submitted
that as a mere ‘licensee’, Naliniben Amin could never have
transferred the ‘license’ to occupy the premises at all
because of the very limited nature of the right that it
creates. Reliance was placed on the principle that a person
cannot transfer a better title than he/she has.
142. A separate and distinct question, addressed in this
note is: Whether the nature of Naliniben Amins right in the
premises    could   be   transferred    with ex    post     facto
approval/permission after the Deed of Assignment was
entered into? That question will be addressed later, but for
the present the submission answers the first submission of
the learned amicus curiae that the right/license of Naliniben
Amin was not transferable at all.
143. Although many allegations and arguments of illegality
and fraud were made, the learned amicus curiae did not
impugn    the   legality of   the  allotment  letter   between
Naliniben Amin and respondent no. 1. Its terms are a
complete answer to the ‘license’ of Naliniben Amin being
non-transferable, per se, as was contended by the learned
amicus curiae.
144.    Clause 1     of  the  allotment letter contemplated
execution of a leave and license agreement. Clause 7
provided that allottee shall not be entitled to sell, transfer
or sub-let without prior written consent of Municipal
Commissioner. The relevant clauses of the Leave and
License Agreement read as under:
“1. That you shall have to execute the Leave &
License agreement in Administrative Officer (Estates)
‘E’ ward office.”
“7. That you shall not be allowed to sell or transfer or
sublet for part with the area allotted to you without
prior written permission from the Municipal
“8. That you shall abide by all the rules and
regulations, terms and conditions framed in this
behalf from time to time and in case of any breach,
default or dispute, Municipal Commissioner’s decision
shall be final and binding on the allottees and allottees
shall submit an undertaking to that effect on Rs.20/-
stamp paper duly signed before Notary.”
145. The Allotment Letter and in particular Clause 7 clearly
establishes that the nature of the right in the premises,
even if taken as that of a ‘licensee’, was transferable with
prior permission. This negates any suggestion that being a
license no transfer was permitted at all. The legality of this
Allotment Letter has not been challenged. For that matter
the legality of the Transfer Policy, alluded to below, has also
not been challenged. Thus, the first limb of the learned
amicus curiae’s submissions fails by reason of the Allotment
Letter alone.
146. It is submitted that there is nothing in the Leave &
License   Agreement     to  show    that  this  Allotment     was
temporary. There is no material on record to show that if
this was not the permanent alternate accommodation, then
what was.
147.    On 10/06/1996, possession of the said Premises
admeasuring 4914 sq.ft. was handed over to Naliniben
Amin on the larger property. [Ex.B/22 (Petition)].
148. On 14/06/1996, agreement of tenement entered into
between MCGM and Naliniben in connection with 4914 sq.
ft. Premises. [Ex.C/23 (Petition)]. Some of the important
“(6) The said godown is given to me for my own use
and for use and occupation. I undertake to not allow
any other person to use and occupy the said room or
any parts thereof without your permission. In case of a
breach of the provision of his clause, I shall be liable to
be ejected summarily.
(10) I also hereby agree to vacate the said
tenement/godown and handover vacant and peaceful
possession of the same to the Corporation as and
when the same is required by the Corporation for any
development whatsoever upon service of 7 day’s
notice in writing by the Municipal Commissioner or any
other Officer authorized on that behalf.”
149. The title of this agreement as being an Agreement of
Tenement is suggestive of the nature of the right that
Naliniben Amin had over the premises. It is, however, made
clear that whatever may be the nature of the right, there
was a right to occupy the premises and to transfer the
150. Although this Agreement of Tenement does not use
the expression of transfer, it is clearly suggestive of an
assignment of the right by another person being in
possession with permission. Significantly, in this context
there is no reference to such permission being ‘prior
151. On 31/12/2007, a Deed of Assignment executed by
Naliniben in favour of respondent no.5 on terms and
conditions   set   out   therein    for   a   consideration      of
Rs.1,60,00,000/-.    The   said   Deed     was    registered     on
12/03/2008. [Ex.D/25 (Petition)]. Some of the relevant
clauses of this Deed of Assignment are :-
1.   The   Assignor   is  a tenant     of   the   Municipal
Corporation of Greater Mumbai in respect of the
godown premsies admeasuring 4914 square feet in a
part of Hindustan Mill at Dr. A. Nair Road, Mumbai 400
011     upon    terms     set     out    in    the     letter
No.Estate/221/MC/Ac dated 16th May 1996 issued by
the Ward Officer (Estates).
2.    The Assignor has agreed to transfer the tenancy
in respect of the said godown premises on as “as is
where is” basis to the Assignee.”
1.    The Assignor hereby transfers and assigns unto
the Assignee the tenancy in respect of all those
godown premises admeasuring 4914 square feet in a
part of Hindustan Mill bearing C.S. No. 1896 of Byculla
Division at Dr. A. Nair Road, Mumbai 400 011
(hereinafter referred to as “the said Premises”) on “as
is where is” basis and the premises constructed prior
to the year 1960 and more than 50 years old.
2.    The Assignor declares that the Assignor is a
lawful tenant of the Municipal Corporation of Greater
Mumbai in respect of the said godown Premises and
the   tenancy   rights   to  the   same      are   valid   and
6.    The   Assignor   states   that   the     said   godown
Premises were allotted to the Assignor upon the
Assignor handing over possession on 22nd June, 1996
of  Godown     bearing    No.4   &   5    at   Lal   Chimney
admeasuring     6712    square    feet   for    development
purposes by the Corporation, i.e. construction of
7.    The   assignor   agrees   that   if   in   future,    the
Municipal Corporation and/or a developer or purchaser
of the said godown Premises offers alternate premises
in place and in lieu of the said godown Premises
and/or the Original Premises and/or compensation for
the same, the Assignee alone shall be entitled to
receive the same and the Assignor shall not claim any
benefits, rights or otherwise in or about or upon
and/or against the same and/or any part thereof.
8.   On execution hereof, the Assignor has handed
over vacant and peaceful possession of the said
Premises to the Assignee.”
152. The argument by the learned amicus curiae that the
assignment or transfer is tainted by fraud and is illegal has
been made without a proper consideration at all of the
Transfer Policy. Moreover, a minor point to consider is that
the assignment has been done in a completely transparent
manner as a registered document. Usually, if a person
wants to occupy premises illegally and contrary to law
parties contrive to devise a system where the premises
remain in the name of original tenant/licensee and the new
occupant is de facto in use and occupation. The fact that
the entire transaction of transfer was open and registered
and as demonstrated below after payment of premiums to
respondent no. 1 militates against an allegation, based on
conjecture and surmise, of fraud.
153. On 12/03/2008, an Irrevocable Power of Attorney
issued by Naliniben in favour of respondent no.5.
154. On 30/06/2008, respondent no.5 made an application
to respondent no.2 for transfer of tenancy from Naliniben to
respondent     no.5  relying   on    the   registered  Deed     of
Assignment of Tenancy.
155. Respondent no.5 paid Rs.16,29,550/- to respondent
no.1 as Transfer Fee for which receipt was issued by
respondent no.1 on 23/09/2008 [Ex.I-1/133 (R5 Reply)].
Thereafter, on 27/10/2008, respondent no.5 had paid
Rs.1,950/- to respondent no.1 for which receipt was issued
by respondent no.1 [Ex.J-1/135 (R5 Reply)]. On the same
date, respondent no.5 paid Rs.2,79,825/- by way of penalty
charged by respondent no.1 for late submission of Transfer
Application for which Receipt was issued by respondent
156. It is submitted that the said Application was made in
accordance     with   Transfer     Policy   dated    11/01/1989
[Ex.G/113 (R5 Reply)] and Clause 7 of the Allotment Letter.
157. In its relevant part the Transfer Policy [Ex.G/113 (R5
Reply)] reads as follows:
“1. The Transferee should be in exclusive possession of
the premises.
10. Transfer Fee is charged on area basis as per
prevailing transfer policy.”
11. Penalty is charged, in legal heir cases also, if the
occupant fails to come get the tenancy transferred in
his/her name within the period of six months from the
date of his/her occupation.”
158.    On 31/01/2009 [Ex.J/47 (Petition)], Meeting held
between    the   representatives    of   respondent   no.1    and
respondent no.3, where, inter alia, certain observations
were made qua the transfer in favour of respondent no.5
being illegal on account of alleged demolition without
permission of MCGM Estate Department.
159. It is submitted that these observations were made
without   hearing    the  respondent    no.5.   Further,    the
Application made as per prevailing policy for transfer of
tenancy was not noticed at this Meeting. None of the Orders
requested for in the said Meeting came to be passed by
respondent no.1.
160. On 10/02/2009, a meeting was held, inter alia, where
the representative of respondent no.5 was present. It was
recorded that request for transfer of tenancy was pending,
but not yet sanctioned. In this meeting, Additional Municipal
Commissioner (WS) directed Dy. Chief Engineer (B.P.) (City)
to ensure no permanent structure were erected on the plot
and on compliance with IOD, CC to be given as per law,
including 2 additional conditions, i.e.
a. Premises allocated to MCGM rules and
regulations will be handed over to MCGM as
and when required as per existing policy.
b.   Permanent    construction  would   not    be
allowed under any circumstances.
161. On 15/03/2013 [Ex.O/147 (R5 Reply)], respondent
no.1 sanctioned the Transfer of Tenancy in accordance with
162. On 16/03/2013, respondent no.5 paid Rs.15,66,500/-
to respondent no.1 in lieu of transfer fees for which
respondent no.1 issued a Receipt. [Ex.R/154 (R5 Reply)].
163. As noted above, respondent no.5 had earlier paid
Rs.16,29,550/- to respondent no.1 as Transfer Fee for
which    Receipt    was   issued   by   respondent     no.1     on
23/09/2008       [Ex.I-1/133   (R5    Reply)].     Further,     on
27/10/2008, respondent no.5 had already paid Rs.1,950/-
to respondent no.1 [Ex.J-1/135 (R5 Reply)] and on the
same date, respondent no.5 had already paid Rs.2,79,825/-
by way of penalty charged by respondent no.1 for late
submission of transfer application for which Receipt was
issued by respondent no.1. [Ex.K-1/137 (R5 Reply)]. It is
submitted that in total, by this date, respondent no.5 had
paid Rs.31,33,000/- to respondent no.1 as transfer fees.
Additionally, Rs.2,79,825/- as penalty for late submission of
transfer application.
164.    On   18/03/2013,     respondent    no.5   executed      an
Indenture in favour of respondent no.1 for completing the
formalities   of   transfer  and   paid   security   deposit    of
165.    On   30/03/2013,     respondent    no.5    executed     an
Agreement      of   Tenement    with   respondent     no.1    and
deposited 3 months’ rent [Ex.S/155 (R5 Reply)].
166. The entire case in the Petition and the submission of
the amicus curiae does not adequately deal with and
address the fundamental fact that under the applicable
Transfer policy, framed much prior to the present transfer,
the grant of subsequent and ex post facto permission is
contemplated. The delay in applying for such permission
resulted in a penalty. The transfer was transparently done
and applied for, and premiums paid to respondent no. 1.
167. Had there been no transfer, the erstwhile occupant
would have been in occupation of the same premises and
would have perhaps been paying an insignificant amount, if
at all, as occupation charges or license fees or rent. Thus,
by receipt of these premiums respondent no. 1 has
benefited. If such transfers are held to be illegal across the
board, then several instances of transfers in accordance
with the Transfer Policy will be invalidated with a liability of
restitution. This submission of the Learned Amicus would
have      far-reaching    consequences  especially when      the
Transfer Policy is not under challenge.

Association             and     another   Vs.   State      of
a. This issue arose in the context of BMC Act,
b. The issue before the Court was whether an
order of demolition was to be invariably followed if
a   construction          was   illegal or  unauthorised
(paragraphs 11/594, 14/595 and 25/596).
c. The Supreme Court held that even if the
construction of any building or execution of any
work is commenced contrary to the provisions of
the Act, it is left to the Commissioner’s discretion
as to the nature of order to be passed (paragraph
d. The Supreme Court held that mere departure
from the authorised plan or putting up of a
construction without sanction does not ipso facto
and without more necessarily and inevitably justify
demolition of the structure. There are cases where
some of such unauthorised constructions are
amenable to compounding (paragraph 59/612).
e. The Supreme Court reversed the High Court’s
decision and directed the Municipal commissioner
to decide the matter again (paragraph 25/596
read with paragraph 57/612 read with paragraph
a. The court observed, against the Petitioners,
that they had carried on ‘construction’ which was
unauthorizedly made as held by the Assistant
On this ground, the SLPs were dismissed.
b. However, the Court further stated that the
mere departure from the authorized plan or
putting up a construction without sanction does
not ipso facto and inevitably justify demolition.
Some such cases of unauthorized construction are
amenable to compounding and some may not be
c. It was held that, these are matters for
authorities to consider having regard to the
nature of transgressions.     The court gave liberty
to the Petitioners to file a plan indicating the
unauthorized       construction    and     to     seek
regularization, if permissible under law (paragraph
a. The court upheld the view of the Authority that
a mezzanine floor had been constructed or
erected without any permission and that the
notice under Section 351 is therefore valid.
b. However, the court followed the approach that
if the construction is capable of being regularized,
the Petitioner may submit a formal application for
regularization and that till the application is
disposed of, no precipitative action should be
taken (paragraphs 5 – 7/pgs.753-754)
a. The trial court, after considering documents,
came to the conclusion that the structure was
unauthorized based on the evidence on record. It
also concluded that the construction was without
any sanction plan and therefore a decision was
taken to demolish the structure. (paragraph 8)
b. However, the court gave the Petitioner an
opportunity to apply for regularization of the
structure and relied upon the view taken by the
Supreme     Court  that  whatever   unauthorized
construction can be regularized according to the
Rules may be regularized on payment of penalty
and fine. (paragraph 9)
c. The court observed that MCGM would have to
consider the regularization proposal in light of
instances cited for regularization as also in light
of prevalent policy decisions and circulars of the
municipal corporation. (paragraph 10)
a. This judgment takes the view that the work of
demolition can be carried out even on the basis of
IOD and did not grant the ad-interim relief to
stop some part of the demolition ( paragraphs
1/Pg. 1, 2/1, 3/2, 5/2, 9/3, 11/3, 14 to 16/4 and
5); findings at paragraph 17/5, 18/5, 21/6 and
174. The Treasurer of Charitable Endowments (supra)
a. The question before the Court was whether on
an Assignment of Lease, the lessee continues to
remain liable to the lessor in respect of his
covenants, even if the privity of estate comes into
existence between the lessor and the lessee
b. The Court considered generally the law in
respect of assignment of leases. In that context,
a submission was made that where the lease
contained an express covenant, then the lessee
was not entitled to transfer the land leased in
any way without a letter from the lessor giving
necessary permission (page 99).
c. Chagla, CJ, however, agreed with the view that
in a situation where the Assignment of Lease
requires the necessary permission of the lessor
but where the lease did not contain a provision
with regards to the rights of re-entry, the
assignment without permission was operative
notwithstanding the covenant.
The assignment was operative notwithstanding
the covenant not to assign without the consent of
the lessor. (pg.213)
The assignment was operative notwithstanding
the covenant not to assign without the consent
of the lessor (pg. 748)
177. Jamshedpur Cements Ltd. (In Liquidation), In re
a. The challenge in this case was to the sale of
property by the official liquidator without the
previous consent of the lessor, i.e., Adityapur
b.    There was an express clause requiring
previous consent (paragraph 3/Pg.1).
c.    While the Court did hold that in the absence
of a prior permission by Adityapur, the OL had no
title at all to sell the property. It also then said
that where such sale is confirmed long ago and
the purchaser / assignee has paid the entire
consideration and made use of the property, the
attempt of the Court would be to regularize the
act of the official liquidator then to defeat it.
Such regularization can be made by obtaining ex-
post-facto    permission      of    Adityapur,      which
Adityapur was prepared to do.           In this regard,
the Court relied upon Graphite India Ltd. vs
a.   Although     this   pertains      to    subsequent
permission    granted     and     the   effect    in   the
continuation   of   electricity    by   the   legislation
(paragraph     15/659),      the     Court     generally
discussed a situation in which ex-post-facto
permission would be valid and recognized. It
recorded that there are situations in which it may
validate the previous act. It relied upon a
judgment in the case of Lord Krishna Textile Mills
Ltd. vs Workmen, AIR 1961 SC 860, which inter
alia stated that once the approval is given, all the
previous    acts    done    or     actions    taken      in
anticipation   of   the    approval      get    validated
b. In that case, the Court held that where the
State Government, the application relates back
or   would   be    effective    from     a   prior    date
a.   The   Petitions,   inter  alia, challenged     the
constitutional validity of the Mumbai Municipal
by which the State Government inserted Section
92(dddd) to the MMC Act with retrospective
effect from 22nd June 1993. (paragraphs 4 and 6/
b.   The   judgment      refers  to  the   validating
provision for validating any levy, demand or
collection of premium on account of transfer fees
before   the   date    of  commencement       of   the
aforesaid Amendment Act (which was gazetted
on 14th August 2012). (paragraph 5)
c. Rule was issued in these Petitions. (paragraph
d. The Petitioners relied upon Section 108(j) of
the Transfer of Property Act, 1882 to contend
that in view of this position, neither the lessee
nor the assignee is required to obtain permission
for transferring the lease nor is the assignee or
transferee required to pay any higher lease rent
than the rate already recommended. (paragraph
20/pg.5) Whilst there is no discussion on the
interpretation of Section 92(dddd), as such, it
can nevertheless be gathered from the judgment
that the consequence of not obtaining prior
permission for transfer of leases of immovable
property is a monetary demand made by MCGM
and not recovery of the property or resumption
of the property. (paragraphs 22-23/pg.5)
e. In fact, the court granted interim relief against
recovery of enhanced lease rent.
f. Significantly, the court issued a direction to the
Municipal Corporation to consider the pending
applications    for   grant   of  NOC    by    Estate
Department and to take decision on pending
applications for building permissions, occupation
certificates in accordance with law. (paragraphs
g. There is no final order and judgment in the
above Writ Petitions.        There are subsequent
interim orders dated 23rd April 2015, 17th October
2015 and 28th June 2017, amongst others.
These orders also indicate that the issue is in
respect of recovery of higher lease rent and
other charges and not one of resumption of
h. This judgment is mentioned here in relation to
the section to which this Hon’ble Court drew our
attention.     However,    any  reference    to   this
judgment is strictly without prejudice to the
submission     that   Section  92(dddd)     has    no
application to the present case which concerns
transfer of a tenement occupied as a license and
not transfer of leases of immovable property.
180. This supports the submissions of respondent no.5 that
even if the entire structure or part of the structure is illegal,
it does not require an order of demolition or cancellation of
permission. In this case, the breach by a historical
demolition was penalized and subsequent permissions have
duly been obtained. The structure has been put up
thereafter and the work continued under the approved plans
and it has been completed. This is supported by granting
approvals to the amended plans and application and
regularization and further change of user as approved.
181. These judgments show that even under the general
law of Transfer of Property Act, an assignment of lease for
an interest in land even though required to be done with
prior permission does not render the transfer or assignment
void or illegal. An assignment without prior permission,
unless there is a specific covenant of re-entry/forfeiture in
such assignment, is operative notwithstanding the covenant
of prior permission. These judgments also support the view
that in a situation such as this, ex-post-facto or subsequent
permission can be obtained to validate the assignment of
transfer consistently with the MCGM policy of 1989 which
allows for assignment or transfer and the assignee being
put in possession and thereafter for permission to be
applied for.
182. This is the policy that is duly applied in this case, but
the judgments show that even de hors the policy a
subsequent approval to such an assignment or approval to
transfer would not be illegal as it would be permissible for
ex   post-facto   such  an  assignment    upon   payment      of
necessary charges of premium.
183. Let us now consider the challenge raised in the PIL
petition. The land in question belonged to respondent no.6-
Hindustan Spinning and Weaving Mills Ltd. It comprised of
two godowns. On 23/11/1992, after following the proper
procedure, the land along with the godowns was acquired
for public purpose viz. extension of Nair Hospital. The
possession of the land was handed over to the MCGM by the
State Government. Nalini was in occupation of godown
nos.4 and 5 at Lal Chimney Compound which were required
for constructing a nurse’s hostel. According to the MCGM,
Nalini was therefore entitled to a permanent alternate
accommodation as a project affected person. It is pertinent
to note that Nalini was accommodated as a project affected
person in the godown which was acquired by the MCGM for
a public purpose. She was permitted to occupy 4914 sq.ft.
of the Hindustan Mill godown as a licensee by virtue of a
leave and license agreement dated 14/06/1996. Clauses 6
and 7 clearly stipulated as under :-
“6.   The said godown is given to me for my own use
and occupation. I undertake not to allow any other
person to use and occupy the said room or any parts
thereof without your permission. In case of a breach
of the provision of this clause, I shall be liable to be
ejected summarily.
7. If a fail to vacate the godown on the termination of
the license, you or any other competent Municipal
Officer or Servant shall be entitled to re-enter the
room without being responsible for any loss or
damage.”
184. We can appreciate the action on the part of the MCGM
to the extent, that in the godown which was acquired for a
public purpose of extension of Nair Hospital, the MCGM
needed to rehabilitate Nalini as a project affected person.
We go to the extent of saying that rehabilitating Nalini could
be said to be a public purpose. It must be borne in mind
that the allotment was not on a permanent basis where all
the rights, title and interest of the MCGM in the godown
came to be transferred in favour of Nalini.       A leave and
licence agreement came to be executed duly accepted and
acknowledged by Nalini pursuant to which she occupied the
premises.     The   leave   and   license  agreement      dated
14/06/1996 ordains Nalini to obtain written permission of
the Municipal Commissioner before allowing any other
person to use and occupy the said godown. In case of
breach, the consequence of summary ejection is provided
for. The Dean, time and again, requested that the portion
allotted to Nalini was required for Nair Hospital. We find
from the minutes of the meeting dated 25/03/2004, that
the Assistant Municipal Commissioner asked the Dean
‘what was the necessity for constructing the Dharmashala
for the relatives of the patients of the Nair Hospital’.
Curiously, the land was acquired and even the DP plan for
the year 1981-2000 indicated that the land in question is
reserved for a public purpose viz. extension of Nair Hospital.
It is really surprising that the MCGM and its Officers were
then asking questions about the purpose of the acquisition
and/or its utility. It would be appropriate to reproduce the
minutes of the meeting held in the office of the AMC (WS)
on 25/03/2004 to appreciate the manner in which the
matter was approached. The minutes make an interesting
reading, as we find that it is the AMC who is virtually
delving on as to what is in the best interest of Nair Hospital,
completely ignoring the request of the Dean, who in our
opinion was best suited to opine on what activities/utilities
are in the best interest of Nair Hospital, moreso when the
acquisition was for a public purpose viz. ‘extension of Nair
Hospital’. The minutes read thus :-
“ Minutes of Meeting held in the office of AMC (WS) on
March 25, 2004 regarding construction of a Atithi
Gruha for patients of Nair Hospital and their relatives.
The following officers were present:-
AMC (WS) inquired where the atithi gruha was to
be located and what is the status of the property,
Dean (N) informed that this property is a godown
belonging to Nair Hospital and has been acquired as
part of extension to Nair Hospital. One third of the
godown has been given to PAP(project affected
person). It is desired to construct an atithi gruha by
demolishing the remaining 2/3 part and construction
on it.
AMC(WS) asked Dean (N) what was the
necessity of constructing an atithi gruha for the
relatives of patients of Nair hospital. He expressed
that MCGM Hospitals should cater basically to patients
of Mumbai only. Dean (N) explained that Nair Hospital
has the only Radiotherapy unit in MCGM. Patients
require radiotherapy for many sessions.             These
patients and their relatives require a place to stay
during these sessions. Many of these relatives stay in
Nair Hospital premises, bath, wash and dry their
clothes and make the hospital premises unhygienic.
Dean(N) informed that the Atithi Gruha will be
constructed through finances from donation. It will be
run by a Charitable Organisation that is already doing
the same work of running dharmashalas in Mumbai.
There will be no financial burden on the MCGM, Dean
(N) also informed that a nominal charge will be
accepted for stay in the Dharmashala.
AMC(WS) expressed that construction of Atithi
Gruha is not a hospital activity, he asked Chief
Engineer (DP) whether this can be allowed under the
DC regulations, CE(DP) answered that in 1992, 1552
sq.m was given as extension to Nair Hospital. There is
no objection to 25-50% of the total area being given
to ancillary usage. Dormitories should be built so that
misuse does not occur.
Law Officer Mr. Malandkar expressed that terms
and conditions should be suitably framed taking into
consideration the MCGM act. There should be no claim
on ownership CA(F) Mr. Nagwekar referred to the
MCGM circular No. FBM/809 of 12 th November 1964.
He also pointed out other two clauses in that circular
that the project may be named after the donor if the
officer covers at least 50% of the cost of the project or
in case the amount of donation offered in less that
50% of the cost of a project, a suitable portion only of
the project viz. a ward etc. He said that donations
should not be received if onerous conditions are
imposed by the donor. He suggested that the entire
money of the donation should be deposited so that
there is no withdrawal of the donor from the donation.
AMC(WS) decided that atithi gruha may be
constructed.     The construction of the atithi gruha
should be liability free. There should be no financial
liability, no recurring or even one-time expenses or
asking for extra establishment.        The water and
electricity charge payment also should not be incurred
by MCGM. The charges for stay in Atithi Griha should
be such that water and electricity charges included.
Subject to above we don’t have problem in
approving the same. Dean (N) to work on details and
submit formal proposal.
185. It is pertinent to note that even a decision was taken
to prepare the plans for extension of Nair Hospital and in
fact the plans were also prepared. One would have
expected the MCGM to process the plans and proceed with
the fulfillment of the public purpose for which the land was
acquired    by   taking  an   informed    decision   in   active
consultation with the Dean. The Dean of Nair Hospital
though called for the meeting, it appears that his stand was
completely ignored, unmindful that the acquisition was for
the purpose of extension of Nair Hospital.      It may be that
the municipal authorities were concerned that there should
be no misuse of the property.     We get an impression that
the MCGM was just not interested in the interest of public.
186. At this stage itself we may refer to the decisions of
the Supreme Court in the case of Royal Orchid Hotels
Limited and another (supra), Uddar Gagan Properties
Ltd. (supra) and Felton Fernandis and others (supra),
wherein it is held that a property acquired for a public
purpose cannot be permitted to be put for a private use. It
is also necessary to make a reference to the decision in
Nagpur Improvement Trust and others (supra).               The
MCGM completely cold shouldered the request made by the
Dean of Nair Hospital for using the land for its extension on
one pretext or the other.
187. Thereafter, what we find is that Nalini executed a
deed of assignment of tenancy dated 31/12/2007 in favour
of the developer. The events from this stage onwards make
it apparent as to how a property acquired for a public
purpose is allowed to be used by a private developer for his
own private gains at the cost of public interest. The
developer is virtually allowed to have his way by the MCGM.
Something that should not be done directly is done
indirectly by the developer even without the permission of
the Commissioner.     On the basis of a tenancy agreement
entered with Nalini, the developer systematically legitimizes
his claim in a property which was acquired for a public
purpose. The public purpose, a noble one, viz. extension of
Nair Hospital, which lakhs of common citizens facing
medical and health issues are desperately in need of.
188. Nalini was only a licensee of the premises. However,
what is assigned by her vide the deed of assignment in
favour of the developer are tenancy rights in respect of the
godown premises in her occupation. Nalini declares that she
is a lawful tenant in respect of the godown premises and
the tenancy rights to the same are valid and subsisting. The
POA obtained by the developer in March 2008 itself from
Nalini, states that Nalini is a tenant of the MCGM. The
developer   immediately    occupies the  premises    on    the
strength of the tenancy agreement without any written
permission of the Municipal Commissioner, a clear breach of
the leave and license agreement. Not only the developer
from 27/03/2008 onwards started applying for repair
permissions to the MCGM, but the MCGM entertained such
permissions. Let us see how step by step the developer gets
over every legal hurdle in his way.
189. On 04/07/2008 the Executive Engineer informs the
Architect of the developer that as per the prevailing repair
policy, the structure being a godown, the proposal cannot
be considered. Undoubtedly, the MCGM has a power to deal
with and dispose of its property but the same has to be in
consonance with the MMC Act and the rules framed
thereunder. Section 105B of the MMC Act provides a power
to evict a person from Corporation premises. Section
105B(1)(b) provides     that   where the Commissioner is
satisfied that any person is in unauthorised occupation of
any Corporation premises, he can order an eviction after
following the procedure prescribed thereunder. Unlike other
licensees, Nalini’s occupation in the Corporation premises
was in her capacity as a PAP to rehabilitate her which may
be regarded as a public purpose. On noticing that Nalini had
assigned her rights in the premises without any written
permission of the Municipal Commissioner in breach of the
leave and license agreement, it was expected of the MCGM
to have proceeded against the developer with eviction
proceedings, having regard to the fact that Nalini was
inducted as a PAP and Nair Hospital was desperately in need
of the premises. This is where we find that the decision
making authorities approached the matter from the point of
view of the interest of a private developer instead of
safeguarding public interest. We must appreciate that some
of the Officers of the Corporation were bold enough to place
on record the correct position, but the manner in which the
officials in the higher echelons of the MCGM acted, leaves
much to be desired.
190. Even without awaiting a decision on the application
made by the Developer for transfer of the tenancy, the
MCGM entertains the repair permission at the Developer’s
behest; in his capacity as a POA of Nalini. The tenancy
agreement Nalini executed makes it clear that she already
had transferred her rights and permitted the Developer to
occupy the premises for a whopping consideration, all this
without the permission of the MCGM. The request for repair
permission made by the Developer was approved by the
Additional    Municipal   Commissioner    and  the  Municipal
Commissioner despite the DMC (Zone 1) clearly recording in
the minutes of the meeting dated 31/01/2009 as under :-
“     Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai
Sub : Illegal demolition of godown in the premises of
A meeting was held in the chamber of D.M.C.(Zone I)
today i.e. 31.1.09 wherein Dr. Rannaware, Dean and
Dy. Dean Dr. Shah of Nair Hospital, AC E – Ward Shri
P. Patil and E. E .BP (City) Shri Anaokar were present.
The structure under reference was a godown
adjoining the premises of Nair Hospital and it was
being used as Storage for records since last so many
years. Somewhere in 1992, the structure was acquired
by Nair Hospital for the purpose of Quarters for Dean
and Dharmashala for the Nair Hospital. Subsequently
in 1996, the part godown was given to one Shri
Madanbhi Amin as PAP tenancy. Till 17.1.2009, the
status of the structure remained unchanged. All of a
sudden on 17.01.2009, Dy. Dean Dr.Shah pointed out
demolition of the structure and he enquired about
the same with E-Ward staff. After knowing that the
structure was being demolished under IOD issued by
EEBP on 10.9.08, Dy.Ch.E.(BP) City and his EEBP were
directed to make        a report to A.M.C.(WS) being
incharge of the Health Department.
In today’s meeting, it was pointed out by AC–E-
Ward that the transfer proposal of the same structure
is under process by virtue of sale deed executed
before the Sub–Registrar of Mumbai dated 12.3.08.
According to the documents filed before the Sub–
Registrar of Mumbai the said premises have been sold
to M/s Rubberwalla Developers Pvt. Ltd. by tenant
Smt Naliniben Amin. This clearly revealed that the
tenant, without the permission/NOC from the MCGM’s
Estate Department, has sold the premises in question
to Rubberwalla Developers Pvt. Ltd. in gross violation
of conditions of tenancy.
On the other hand, Rubberwalla Developers had
filed an application before the EEBP for the change
of user on the strength of Power of Attorney given to
him by Smt. Naliniben Amin.
It is stated by EEBP that the Building Proposal
Department has issued IOD but has not issued CC and
did now allow the demolition of the said structure.
Incidentally, it may be mentioned here that the land
under question is reserved in DP for Extension to Nair
Hospital, it is     not understood how DP and BP
Department could process such proposal for addition/
alternations, construction of stilt etc for making IT
user and issue IOD for the same. It is seen from the
above information that the tenant has illegally given
Power of Attorney to Rubberwalla           Developers in
gross violation of tenancy conditions and hence it
deserves action of eviction under Section 105 (b) of
Since the Dean, Nair Hospital is insisting for the
construction of Dharmashala for the Nair Hospital, the
entire matter is required to be reviewed in favour of
MCGM and Nair Hospital in public interest.
In the meantime, AC, E–Ward is directed not to
process proposal for transfer and refund the charges
accepted for transfer, if any, paid by the applicant.
In view of above , JT. M.C.(I) A. M.C. (WS)/M.C.’s
orders are requested:
1. to cancel the tenancy of Smt. Naliniben Amin
by issuing her notice to under Section 105 (B) of
the MMC Act.
2. to issue instructions to Dy. Ch. E. (BP) City to
revoke the IOD issued to M/s Rubberewalla
3. to direct AC/Estates/ Dy. Ch. E. (BP) to restore
possession of the premises to the Nair Hospital.
4. To conduct enquiry against the concerned
staff of Building Proposal/Development Plan
191.     The minutes of the meeting dated 31/01/2009
clearly reveals that the Dean of Nair Hospital was insisting
for construction of Dharmashala for Nair Hospital and it was
recommended that the entire matter is required to be
reviewed in favour of the MCGM and Nair Hospital in public
interest. It also observes that Nalini had illegally given POA
to the Developer in gross violation of the tenancy condition
and hence deserves action of eviction under Section 105(B)
of the MMC Act. It states that the tenant without
permission/NOC has sold the premises in question to the
192. We have already noticed that on 04/07/2008 the
Executive Engineer regretted considering the proposal of
the Developer for partial repairs and proposed loft as the
structure was a godown. Immediately thereafter, the
Developer in its capacity as a POA holder of Nalini
submitted a proposal for change of activity from godown to
IT office, flattening of roof, stilt for parking and additions or
alterations of existing structure. In the communication
dated 13/08/2008 (page 35 of the PIL petition), it is
mentioned that a proposal is moved for change of existing
user of the premises from godown to IT office. Approval
was therefore requested to allow change of activity
proposed by the architect and to allow construction, which
was approved at different levels. The IOD then came to be
issued on 10/09/2008. It is pertinent to note that the
proposal was for repair permission of the existing structure
in accordance with the repair policy of the Corporation.
193.     The Developer even without a CC for demolition,
demolished the godown in question on 17/01/2009 and
18/01/2009. The IOD for commencement of work upto the
plinth level was earlier issued on 10/09/2008. The report of
the acting Dean dated 20/01/2009 clearly mentions that
pursuant to the demolition, what exists is a vacant plot.
That such a demolition is carried out is reflected from the
DMC (Zone 1) report dated 31/01/2009 wherein orders
were requested by him in terms of the minutes of the
meeting dated 31/01/2009.
194.    In the minutes dated 10/02/2009, in the presence of
MLA, the Developer, DMC (Zone 1), Dean Nair Hospital, the
Additional   Municipal    Commissioner    records  that    the
Developer agreed to hand over the possession of the land if
required by Corporation. It is recorded that Dean, Nair
Hospital objected as tenancy rights of the Developer are in
question. The Deputy CE informed that the Developer
started the work of demolition without CC and that is why
stop work notice was issued. He further informed that as
per DP reservation, the land is reserved for expansion of
Nair Hospital and is in possession of the Corporation.
Despite these materials on record, the Additional Municipal
Commissioner directed Deputy Chief Engineer to ensure
that no permanent structure is erected at this plot, further
recording that on compliance of the conditions of IOD of
building proposal, CC shall be given as per law and further
directed to incorporate the following two conditions in the
IOD, confirming laws of tenancy rights :
“Premises if allocated as per norms of MCGM Rules
and Regulation then it will be handed over back to
BMC, as and when required within stipulated time as
per existing policy.
Permanent construction shall not be allowed under any
circumstances. The additional Municipal Commissioner
(WS) informed that he will put up the case before the
Municipal Commissioner. Again on 11.02.2009 the
Assistant commissioner (Estate) records that the
existing tenanted premises for which repairs are
proposed is found demolished. The Acting Dean’s
objections are recorded.”
Suburbs) having noticed the irregularity on the part of the
Developer in demolishing the premises without permission
and having noticed that under the garb of repairs, the
Developer wanted to put up a new construction, yet goes on
to recommend that in view of the permissions granted by
the Deputy Chief Engineer and the IOD having already been
issued, the repair should be carried out. He further records
that there should be no permanent construction and in
future if the Corporation needs the land, an undertaking to
that effect has to be obtained from the developer. On
06/03/2009 the Municipal Commissioner ordered that the
Developer may go ahead with the repair as per IOD
conditions and as recommended by the Additional Municipal
196. We find that the Municipal Commissioner granted
repair permission on the basis of an application made by
the Developer as a POA holder of the principal tenant. On
the one hand, the Developer applied as a POA holder of the
principal tenant and on the other hand, claims to have
acquired tenancy rights by virtue of the deed of assignment
executed by Nalini, all this without the permission of the
Municipal    Commissioner.    Nalini   without  the    written
permission of the Commissioner allowed the Developer to
occupy the godown premises.       The repair permissions are
considered even before the application for transfer of
tenement in favour of the Developer is decided. Nalini acted
in complete breach of the leave and licence agreement.
Nalini accepted consideration of Rs.1 crore 60 lakhs without
obtaining any prior permission.    Without permission Nalini
surrenders her rights in favour of the Developer and puts
him in possession contrary to the leave and licence
agreement knowing fully well that she is only a licensee
governed by the terms of licence. We probably would have
looked at the matter from a different perspective had the
premises not been a property acquired from a private
person for a public purpose. The public interest subsisted
and on the contrary increased manifold over the years.
MCGM conveniently overlooked the overwhelming public
interest by allowing all the breaches committed by the
Developer to be regularized. MCGM overlooks noble public
interest, then overlooks that private land was acquired for a
public purpose, then overlooks that in public interest a PAP
was accommodated, then overlooks that the PAP surrenders
the tenancy rights in favour of a private developer without
prior permission of MCGM, then overlooks that private
developer is put in possession of a property needed for a
public purpose without permission of MCGM, then overlooks
that even before the application for transfer of tenancy
could be processed the repair permissions are granted to
such a developer, then overlooks that repair permission is
granted even though the developer demolishes the building
without CC, then overlooks that contrary to the repair
permission a new building is constructed, all this at the cost
of public interest. We find that not only the breaches on the
part of the Developer are condoned at every stage, but
every irregularity is brazenly regularized in the garb of
exercising the powers conferred by the municipal laws. We
have no hesitation in saying that present is a case where
there has been gross abuse of powers at the cost of
overwhelming public interest.     The only inference that we
can draw is that the Developer’s personal interests have
been advanced in the process.        The public interest was
staring at the MCGM despite which MCGM chose not to
initiate eviction proceeding against Nalini and the Developer
under section 105(B) of the MMC Act. It is surprising that
the agreement Nalini executed was for transfer of tenancy
in favour of the Developer, which was impermissible, as
Nalini was only a licensee, despite which the MCGM accepts
the Developer as a licensee.       We have no hesitation in
holding that permitting such a transfer is in gross abuse of
197.    Mr.   Jagtiani,   learned   senior  advocate    for    the
Developer submitted that a post facto approval can always
be obtained for a tenancy and in order to support this
contention, relied upon various decisions; that of the
Supreme Court in Graphite India Ltd. and another
(supra), the decisions of the Bombay High Court in the case
of John Nadjarian (supra), The Treasurer of Charitable
Endowments (supra), the Calcutta High Court decision in
Jamshedpur Cements Ltd. (In Liquidation), In re Hi-
Tech Chemicals P. Ltd. (supra). He submits that in fact
the tenancy agreement was entered into between the
Developer and the MCGM on 18/03/2013 thereby permitting
the Developer to occupy the premises as a licensee.             No
doubt a post facto approval can always be obtained for a
tenancy.   This is a case where we are dealing with a fact
situation in respect of premises acquired in public interest,
occupied in public interest by a PAP and during the
subsistence of the public interest and in the garb of
exercising   the    powers    conferred    by  municipal     laws
transferred to a private developer for private gains.         The
decisions cited by Mr. Jagtiani therefore cannot have any
application in the facts of the present case. The impression
that we gather is that the Municipal Commissioner as well
as the Additional Municipal Commissioner were more
concerned about the private interest of the Developer than
the public interest of its own wing i.e. Nair Hospital. It is not
as if all the facts were not placed before the Additional
Municipal Commissioner or the Municipal Commissioner. In
every meeting, the Dean of Nair Hospital pointed out the
dire need of the land for extension of the Nair Hospital. The
MCGM, in the written submissions stated that, though,
there   was   an    unauthorized   transfer  and  an     illegal
demolition, the MCGM on the basis of the transfer and
repair policy of BMC, accepted the Developer as a licensee.
We find that the MCGM considered the matter not from the
stand point of the public interest involved, but was more
concerned about protecting the rights of the Developer in
terms of the transfer and repair policy even before the
application for transfer of tenancy was considered.
198.   Some of the authorities below the level of the
Additional Municipal Commissioner of the MCGM on a
correct assessment of the situation recommended that the
Developer should be evicted and Nair Hospital be handed
over the premises. After the IOD was issued on the
proposal of the Developer to carry on repairs of the existing
godown, the godown was demolished even without waiting
for the CC. A report is on record that what was in existence
is a vacant land. Despite noticing all this, the Additional
Municipal Commissioner and the Municipal Commissioner,
shockingly, granted repair permission in respect of a
structure which was not even in existence. The Additional
Municipal Commissioner thought it appropriate to condone
the defaults of the Developer by imposing a condition that
there shall be no permanent construction. All this after the
structure is demolished. We wonder why the top officials of
the MCGM have been so kind to the Developer at the cost of
Nair Hospital. Here is a Developer who enters into MCGM
premises acquired for a public purpose without written
permission of the Commissioner, then secures an IOD for
repairs of the existing godown, demolishes the same
without CC and then goes on to construct a new building on
the vacant piece of land contrary to the order of the
Municipal Commissioner could still get himself recognized as
a licensee. The Additional Municipal Commissioner did not
pay any heed to the request of the Dean, who was time and
again requesting for the possession of the land which was
acquired for the public purpose of extension of Nair
Hospital. We can only say that the State Government
having acquired the land from the respondent no.6, a
private owner for a public purpose, which was then handed
over to the Corporation, obviously for utilization of the
public purpose viz. extension of Nair Hospital as per the
reservation in the DP, is then licensed to a private developer
putting the public interest to peril. It is disturbing to note
that such gross irregularities in the matter of transfer of
tenement, are sought to be regularized in a manner which
has an effect of defeating public interest. This is a matter
where instead of safeguarding public interest, the interests
of a private developer are sought to be safeguarded by not
only   condoning   and     overlooking   the   gross    material
irregularities, but tried to be justified by MCGM on the
ground that the permissions are granted in accordance with
the repair policy and the Developer has agreed to abide by
the terms of the transfer policy.
199. We list below the upshot of the above discussion in
brief, which reveals how the Developer prevailed at every
stage over the MCGM for its private gains and at the cost of
public interest.
(a)   The DP of 1981 to 2000 reserved the land
belonging to respondent no.6 for a public purpose viz.
extension of Nair Hospital.
(b)   The State Government acquires the land for a
public purpose viz. extension of Nair Hospital and
hands it over to the MCGM.
(c)    Being a project affected person, Nalini is allotted
part of the godown premises on the acquired land by
virtue of leave and license agreement.
(d)   Leave and license agreement prohibits Nalini
from parting with the possession or creating any
interest in the godown without written permission of
the Municipal Commissioner. For any breach she was
liable for action of eviction under Section 105B of the
(e)   Nalini executes the deed of tenancy in favour of
the   Developer.   The    Developer  pays   a    sum    of
Rs.1,60,00,000/- to Nalini. Developer occupies the
premises and the tenancy is transferred without any
written permission of the Commissioner, though Nalini
was in occupation as a licensee being a project
affected person.
(f)   The Developer immediately forwards a proposal
for repair permission of the godown to the MCGM.
(g)   The Executive Engineer informs that such a
proposal cannot be considered as per the repair policy
as the structure under reference is used as a godown.
(h)   The architect immediately submits a proposal for
change of activity from godown to IT office which is
recommended and granted promptly.
(i)   IOD is issued for carrying out the repairs as
(j)   Even without obtaining CC for demolition, the
Developer demolishes the godown.
(k)   The Dean, Nair Hospital is virtually pleading for
the premises which were acquired for its purpose in
public interest.
(l)   The DMC (Zone 1) requests for cancellation of
tenancy of Nalini, revocation of IOD to the developer,
restoration of possession of premises to Nair Hospital
and conducting enquiry against the staff of building
proposal/development plan department. It is pointed
out that the structure for which repair permission is
applied was already demolished. It is also pointed out
that Nalini without valid permission of MCGM has sold
the premises to the Developer.
(m) A stop work notice is issued to the Developer.
(n)   The AMC (WS) noticing the above factors, still
recommends the proposal for repairs in view of the
IOD already granted and subject to the conditions that
the    Developer    would   undertake   to  restore    the
premises when MCGM wants them and that no
permanent construction will be made.
(o)   The    Municipal    Commissioner     accepts     the
recommendation of the AMC (WS).
(p)   The Dean, Nair Hospital has no option but to fall
in line in view of the Municipal Commissioner’s
decision, but requests that an enquiry be made as
some permanent construction activity is ongoing on
the plot (letter dated 14/01/2010).
(q)   In the teeth of the condition imposed by the
MCGM that permanent construction shall not be
allowed under any circumstances, the Developer puts
up a permanent construction on the vacant plot of
land on the strength of IOD issued for repairs.
200.     We   are   sorry  to   observe  that   not  only    the
irregularities are overlooked but the authorities of the
MCGM appear to have indirectly assisted the Developer at
every stage by ignoring the genuine pleas made by the
Dean, Nair Hospital and some of its own officers.       On the
basis of the repair permission, which was granted even
before the Developer was recognized as a licensee, a
permanent new construction altogether is put up on a
vacant plot of land, flouting the orders of the Municipal
themselves. We feel sorry for the Dean of the Nair Hospital
who has been treated so shabbily by the MCGM, thereby
depriving the patients with medical conditions and their
relatives accompanying them of some basic needs, all for
the benefit of a private developer. We cannot allow public
interest to be defeated in the manner that is sought to be
done by the MCGM.
201.      The PIL petition is filed in the year 2013. The
premises are in the Developer’s occupation since March
2008, for more than 14 years. Till this date, the MCGM has
not shown any urgency in getting back the premises despite
the undertaking given by the Developer that the premises
would be restored when demanded. Even today the stand of
the MCGM is that at the appropriate stage they would call
upon the Developer to hand over the possession and the
Developer too says that it is bound to hand it over to the
MCGM     in  terms    of  the   permissions   whenever      the
Corporation wants the premises back. Judicial notice can be
taken of the sheer lack of space and hardship faced by the
patients, their family members, relatives, the doctors and
the staff in municipal hospitals. Public health is one of the
most important functions to be discharged by the MCGM.
Law is well settled that in the exercise of writ jurisdiction,
we can test the decision making process and not the
decision itself.  However, taking an overall view of the
matter and more particularly, in view of the condition
imposed by the MCGM about the Developer handing over
the premises when called upon, which the Developer does
not dispute, this is a fit case for passing mandatory orders.
In a city like Mumbai, where space comes at a premium,
the sheer apathy on the part of the MCGM to get back the
premises and hand it over to Nair hospital is appaling.        It
was as far back in the year 1981, the development plan
reserved the land for Nair Hospital. The possession of the
acquired land was actually handed over in the year 1992 to
the MCGM. Since then repeated requests have been made
by the Dean for handing over the premises. The MCGM
instead of taking action against Nalini for committing breach
of the terms of the leave and license agreement, on the
contrary recognizes the Developer as a licensee, who had so
brazenly entered into the godown premises without any
permission of the Municipal Commissioner. This is a classic
case of how the Developer has got away with so many
irregularities and yet the MCGM except for saying that at
the appropriate stage they will recover the possession,
nothing is done.    The manner in which the officials in the
higher echelons of the MCGM proceeded at the relevant
time is not only shocking, against public interest, but to the
detriment of Nair Hospital and ultimately the citizens for
whom the land was acquired. We are saddened to note that
instead of safeguarding public interest, the then officials of
the MCGM have all gone out of the way to promote the
private interest of the Developer. All this at the cost of the
citizens for whom the State Government had acquired the
land in a prime location at Mumbai to cater to their health
and medical needs. We are amazed at the insensitivity
which is displayed in the present case as we find that one of
the officers of the MCGM had the audacity to ask the Dean
of Nair Hospital as to why Nair Hospital needs the
Dharmashala, despite the fact that the land in question was
acquired for Nair Hospital, and it is the Dean’s views which
should have received primal importance. We would have
expected the MCGM, even now to have displayed a sense of
urgency. Surprisingly there is none. Except for saying that
the extension is proceeding in a phased wise manner and at
the appropriate stage the Developer will be called upon to
hand over the possession, we find the response of the
MCGM as cold as it can be.
202. It is well settled that a public body cannot deal with
its property without inviting bids and conducting an auction.
If any authority is required in support of this proposition,
we rely upon the decisions of the Supreme Court in the case
of M.I. Builders vs. Radhey Shyam Sahu and others22
and in the case of Sterling Computers Limited vs. M & N
Publications Limited and others          . In a very novel way,
the Developer has succeeded in bypassing these settled
legal principles.
203. Now a brief reference to the repair policy under which
the permission has been obtained. A compilation has been
produced on record by Shri Godbole, learned counsel for
MCGM regarding repair proposal. The MCGM in the brief
submissions has taken a stand that this is not a case where
the municipal property is being permanently divested and
according to the stage of the construction, the concerned
property will be used by taking it back from the Developer
when Phase-3 of the project is implemented.       It is stated
that though, there was an unauthorized transfer and illegal
demolition; considering the transfer policy and repair policy
of the BMC, the developer was accepted as a Municipal
licensee (and not as tenant) and construction was allowed
without changing the footprint of original structure and
subject to the conditions in the proposal/recommendation of
the AMC (W.S) and approval of the Municipal Commissioner.
We have seen the photographs of the structure. The original
structure is demolished. There was no structure left for
carrying out repairs. The condition imposed by AMC was
that there has to be no new construction. We find that there
is a completely new construction raised, despite which the
MCGM     chooses   to  ignore   something   so  glaring.   The
construction   which   has   come   up  is  contrary   to   the
conditions imposed by the MCGM. Though, it is the
contention of learned counsel for the MCGM that the
Developer is accepted as a licensee in view of the transfer
policy, but it has to be borne in mind that the MCGM is
recognizing the Developer as a licensee of premises which
was acquired for a public purpose in which Nalini was
allotted the premises on a leave and license basis in her
capacity as a PAP. Recognizing the Developer as a licensee
in this manner amounts to defeating the public purpose for
which the land was acquired and which is still subsisting.
204. Even so far as the repair policy is concerned, we find
that Chapter II deals with scrutiny of proposals for repairs.
One of the prerequisite while submitting the proposal in
terms of 1(iii) is photographs showing condition of building.
In the present case, when the proposal of repairs was
submitted by the Developer, the godown was in existence.
Later on it was demolished.        It is thereafter that the
Municipal Commissioner granted repair permission on the
basis of IOD granted prior to demolition. We fail to
understand why the MCGM went soft in case of such a
developer. To top it, the Additional Municipal Commissioner
imposes a condition that no new construction can be put up.
We have already noticed that a completely new structure
has been constructed by the Developer which is sought to
be    justified  by  contending   that   the   footprints    are
205. Mr. Godbole, invited our attention to the short and
long term development plan of Nair hospital and T.N.
Medical College prepared in order to facilitate proper facility
distribution and catering to the additional capacity of
patient’s care dated 28/06/2016. While going through the
proposed   development,     we    noticed clause (e),   which
mentions that there is a proposal to construct a multistoried
building for rehabilitating the tenants which are currently
occupying the pieces of land reserved for Nair Hospital
extension and partly for emergency labour quarters.        Mr.
Godbole submitted that this is only a proposal.     We hope
and trust that the MCGM does not propose to rehabilitate
the Developer, a private developer who benefited so long
from the unwarranted action on the part of the MCGM.
206.    The construction has been put up by the Developer
after obtaining permission from the MCGM.        The MCGM
allowed the construction to be put up. Now that we propose
to allow the PIL petition and direct the Developer to hand
over the premises back to MCGM, the question came up for
consideration as to whether the Developer should be
compensated. We find that the construction was put up on
the understanding that whenever the MCGM would require
the premises back, the same would be handed over to the
MCGM.     Moreover, the Developer is in possession of the
premises for last more than 14 years and has upon
construction of the new building, utilized the structure for
private purpose and gains. The Developer was always well
aware of the consequences and, therefore, the question of
compensation does not arise.
207.   Before parting, we must appreciate the efforts of the
Deputy Municipal Commissioner and other officials who
made an attempt to put up the proposals in accordance with
law but they unfortunately had to fall in line with the
dictates of their superiors.
208. We place on record our appreciation for the efforts of
learned amicus curiae Shri Assem Naphade in presenting
this PIL petition so effectively.
209.    The PIL petition therefore deserves to be allowed in
terms    of  prayer   clauses    (a) & (b).  The   developer-
respondent no. 5 to vacate the subject premises within one
month from the date of uploading of this order. In the facts
of the present case, there shall be no order as to costs.
210. Rule is made absolute in the above terms.
211. In the light of the disposal of the PIL petition, the
interim application also stands disposed of.
