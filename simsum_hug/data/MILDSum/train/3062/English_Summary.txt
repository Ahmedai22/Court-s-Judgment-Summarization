 It is also stated that the accused shall attend all the dates in court unless prevented by a reasonable cause. Further, once the trial begins, they shall not in any manner delay the trial proceedings. Detailed order recording the reasons for the grant of bail is yet to be uploaded.
 The NCB had arrested the trio on October 3 following a raid at the international cruise terminal the previous day. They had moved the High Court after rejection of bail by the Special NDPS Court, on October 20.
 NCB has alleged that the accused are part of a larger conspiracy, Khan has international links and thus required for further interrogation to unearth the truth.
 The agency further alleged that Khan is an influential person and attempts have already been made to influence witnesses and tamper with evidence.
 Meanwhile, Khan, represented by Senior Advocate Mukul Rohatgi, that his arrest was made in sheer violation of Article 22 of the Constitution, inasmuch as he was not informed about the correct grounds for arrest.
 He also denied allegations of "conscious possession" of contraband which was recovered from his friend Arbaaz (6gms charas).
