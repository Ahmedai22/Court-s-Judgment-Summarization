1.    This writ petition has been preferred on behalf of the
petitioner being aggrieved with the order dated 16.12.2021
passed by the Family Court, Bhilwara (for short ‘the Court below’)
in Suit No.Nil/2021, whereby the joint application filed by the
petitioner and the respondent (hereinafter “parties”) for waiver of
six months period prescribed under Section 13-B(2) of the Hindu
Marriage Act, 1955 (for short ‘the Act of 1955’) has been
2.    Mr. Bhadu, learned counsel for the respondent, submitted
that the respondent is also aggrieved with the order impugned
and this writ petition has been filed with the consent of the
(2 of 5)             [CW-118/2022]
respondent. Learned counsel submitted that he has no objection if
the relief prayed for in this writ petition is granted.
3.    Brief facts of the case are that the marriage of the parties
was    solemnized    as   per  Hindu     customs   on   25.11.2003    in
Mandalgarh, Bhilwara. It appears that soon after the marriage, the
relations of the parties became strained and both of them have
been residing separately from last four years.
4.    Despite the best efforts of the parties to restore conjugal
relations and in spite of regular counselling by their near relatives,
the matrimonial dispute between them could not be settled and
therefore the parties jointly filed an application under Section 13-B
of the Act of 1955 seeking divorce by mutual consent before the
court below on 03.12.2021.
5.    The court below registered the said application and fixed the
next date as 20.01.2022 for counselling of the parties.
6.    In the meantime, the parties preferred a joint application
praying for waiver of six months’ statutory period specified under
Section 13-B(2) of the Act of 1955. Arguments on the said
application were heard and the court below dismissed the said
application vide its order dated 16.12.2021.
7.    Being aggrieved with order dated 16.12.2021, the present
writ petition has been preferred before this Court.
8.    Learned counsel for the parties have submitted that both,
the petitioner and the respondent are educated persons and both
of them have decided to end their marriage by mutual consent
after due deliberations. It is also submitted that the decision by
the parties to end their marriage has not been taken in a hurry
and reconciliation between the parties is highly unlikely. It is
further submitted that the conditions set out in the case of
(3 of 5)            [CW-118/2022]
Amardeep Singh Vs. Harveen Kaur, reported in (2017) 8
SCC 746, under which statutory period of six months, as specified
under Section 13-B(2) of the Act of 1955, can be waived are
fulfilled in the present case and the court below has erred in
refusing waiver of the six months’ statutory period.
9.      Learned counsel for the parties have therefore jointly prayed
that the order impugned be set aside and the court below be
directed to condone or waive the statutory period specified under
Section 13-B(2) of the Act of 1955.
10.     Heard learned counsel for the parties and perused the
impugned order.
11.     The Hon’ble Supreme Court in Amardeep Singh’s case
(supra) has held as under :-
“19. Applying the above to the present situation,
we are of the view that where the Court dealing
with a matter is satisfied that a case is made out
to waive the statutory period under Section 13-
B(2), it can do so after considering the following :
i) the statutory period of six months specified in
Section 13-B(2), in addition to the statutory
period of one year under Section 13-B(1) of
separation of parties is already over before the
first motion itself;
ii) all efforts for mediation/conciliation including
efforts in terms of Order 32-A Rule 3 CPC/Section
23(2) of the Act/Section 9 of the Family Courts
Act to reunite the parties have failed and there is
no likelihood of success in that direction by any
further efforts;
iii) the parties have genuinely settled their
differences including alimony, custody of child or
any other pending issues between the parties;
iv) the waiting period will only prolong their
agony.
The waiver application can be filed one week after
the first motion giving reasons for the prayer for
waiver. If the above conditions are satisfied, the
(4 of 5)             [CW-118/2022]
waiver of the waiting period for the second motion
will be in the discretion of the court concerned.
20. Since we are of the view that the period
mentioned in Section 13-B(2) is not mandatory
but directory, it will be open to the Court to
exercise its discretion in the facts and
circumstances of each case where there is no
possibility of parties resuming cohabitation and
there are chances of alternative rehabilitation.”
12.   After taking into consideration the facts of the present case,
I am of the opinion that the conditions set out by the Hon’ble
Supreme Court in Amardeep Singh’s case (supra) are fulfilled in
the present case.
13.   In light of the facts and circumstances of the case,
particularly the fact that the parties are sufficiently educated and
are aware of their rights – the respondent (husband) is running a
shop also; as they have mutually decided to end their matrimony
finding no hope/chance of reconciliation, I am of the opinion that
their application for waiver of the statutory period of six months
specified under Section 13-B(2) of the Act of 1955 deserves
14.   Hence, this writ petition is allowed. The impugned order
dated 16.12.2021 passed by the Court below is set aside and their
application filed by the parties for waiver of the statutory period of
six months specified under Section 13-B(2) of the Act of 1955 is,
hereby allowed. The statutory period of six months specified under
Section 13-B(2) of the Act of 1955 is hereby waived in exercise of
extraordinary powers available to this Court by virtue of Article
226 of the Constitution of India.
15.   The parties are directed to appear before the court below on
20.01.2022, whereafter the concerned Family Court will pass
decree of divorce in accordance with law.
