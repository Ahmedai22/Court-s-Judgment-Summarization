Crl.O.P.Nos.29914, 29915, 29916, 29917, 29918 & 29919 of 2015 are filed to
call for the entire records in E.O.C.C.Nos.101, 102, 103, 104, 105 & 106 of 2015 on

and quash the same.
2.Respondent filed these complaints against the petitioner for the violation of
provisions under Income Tax Act, 1961, which are punishable under the Act. The
allegations made in the complaint, in brief, are extracted here,
Petitioner/accused is a cine actor and Director deriving income from
remuneration for acting in movies and also directing movies. He ought to have filed
his return of income for the assessment year 2002-2003 on or before 31.07.2002.
However, he did not filed his return of income within the due date prescribed by the
statute and thus contravened the provisions of Section 139 (1) of the Income Tax Act,
1961. It is an offence punishable under Section 276 CC of Income Tax Act, 1961. He
ought to have paid the advance tax within the prescribed dates of 15.09.2001,
15.12.2002 and 15.03.2002 and filed the relevant return for the assessment year
2002-2003 on or before 31.07.2002. Petitioner did not pay advance tax and failed to
file return of income within the statutory due date. Thus, committed the offence under
Crl.O.P.Nos.29914, 29915, 29916, 29917, 29918 & 29919 of 2015
Section 276 CC of the Income Tax Act, 1961 by concealing true the correct income
by not filing the return of income and committed an offence under Section 276 C (1)
Income Tax Act, 1961. The survey operations under Section 133 A were conducted
on 04.09.2003 and a search was conducted on 26.10.2005. It revealed unaccounted
receipt of money by the petitioner towards remuneration for directing movies. A
statutory notice under Section 148 of Income Tax Act, 1961 dated 30.03.2004 was
issued to the petitioner to prepare a true and correct return of total income including
the undisclosed income assessable for the assessment year 2002-2003 within 30 days
from the date of service of the notice. Notice was acknowledged on 05.04.2004.
Petitioner ought to have filed the return of income on on or before 05.05.2004, which
he failed. Through a letter dated 03.05.2005, he requested time to file return till
15.06.2004. But he did not file the return of income even after 15.06.2004.
Therefore, a show cause notice dated 22.07.2004 was issued. Petitioner filed the
return of income for assessment year 2002-2003 only on 15.09.2004. He admitted a
total income of Rs.40,00,000/- in the covering letter. It is stated that petitioner
received gross remuneration of Rs.50,00,000/- for directorial service of the film
''KHUSHI'' (Hindi). A sum of Rs.10,00,000/- was claimed as expenditure.
Assessment was completed under Section 143 (3) on 30.03.2005 assessing his total
income at Rs.1,68,38,410/-. Apart from these, a sum of Rs.30,00,000/- was added as
unexplained deposit in his bank account in Dena Bank, T. Nagar Branch. Gross tax
Crl.O.P.Nos.29914, 29915, 29916, 29917, 29918 & 29919 of 2015
and interest demand worked out to Rs.85,82,780/-. After giving credit to payments
made of Rs.13,00,000/-, net demand was raised at Rs.72,82,780/-. Penalty
proceedings under Section 271 (1) (C) were initiated simultaneously. Petitioner filed
petition before the Joint Commissioner of Income Tax, Media Range on 12.05.2005,
requesting for stay of collection of demand till the disposal of appeal by the
Commissioner. This petition was rejected on 08.08.2005. Petitioner filed a letter
dated 23.11.2005 before the Income Tax Officer, requesting a time for payment of
taxes till the search issues are resolved. It was observed by the Commissioner of
Income Tax, that “As soon as PO is lifted on Bank Account, Assessee is required to
pay the installments”. However, petitioner did not pay the taxes though the PO on
bank account was lifted. Since, the petitioner has not paid the amount as per demand
notice under Section 156 served along with the assessment order under Section 143
(3), notice under Section 226 (5) dated 12.08.2005 was issued to M/s.Prasad Film
Lab and M/s.Gemini Colour Lab to realize the garnishee amounts. Agricultural lands
and the flats belonging petitioner were placed under provisional attachment under
Section 281 B of the Income Tax Act. Original assessment was confirmed in appeal
on 31.03.2014. Even, thereafter, petitioner has not paid the arrears. A notice under
Section 153 (A) of Income Tax Act, dated 07.07.2006 was issued to the petitioner to
prepare a true and correct return of total income including undisclosed income for the
assessment year 2002-2003, within 45 days from the date of service of the notice. It
Crl.O.P.Nos.29914, 29915, 29916, 29917, 29918 & 29919 of 2015
was acknowledged on 22.07.2006. Petitioner ought to have filed return of income on
or before 05.09.2006, he failed. Again a show cause notice dated 26.10.2006 was
issued to the petitioner to show cause why the prosecution under Section 276 CC of
the Income Tax Act, 1961 should not be initiated. It was acknowledged on
11.01.2007. A reminder dated 11.01.2007 was issued. There was no reply from the
petitioner. Assessment under Section 153 A r/w. Section 144 was completed on
24.09.2008 on a total income of Rs.2,00,56,592/-. Based on the materials seized a
sum of Rs.1,70,56,592/-representing the money received for the remuneration of the
film ''Nani'' and another sum of Rs.30,00,000/- for the remuneration towards the film
''New'' were added. Total gross demand was determined at Rs.1,50,02,522/-. After
giving credit to self assessment tax paid at Rs.10,00,000/-, net demand payable was
determined at Rs.1,50,02,522/-. Penalty proceedings for concealment of income were
initiated under Section 271 (1) (c) simultaneously. Appeal was dismissed by a
common order dated 31.03.2014 and the assessment was confirmed. Notice under
Section 226 (3) to Dena Bank, HDFC Bank, Indian Bank, Sri Ramesh Babu,
Smt.Mallika Devi, M/s.Geetha Arts and M/s.Kanakarathina Media Pvt. Ltd were
issued to realize the garnishee amounts. As the amounts could not be collected by a
letter dated 22.05.2014, the outstanding demands were certified to the tax recovery
officer. The tax recovery officer issued notices in ITCP-1 to the petitioner on
11.06.2014. It was served on the petitioner on 13.06.2014. However, there was no
Crl.O.P.Nos.29914, 29915, 29916, 29917, 29918 & 29919 of 2015
response from the petitioner. Petitioner filed stay petition before Income Tax
Appellate Tribunal, Chennai and the stay petition was dismissed. Thus, there is gross
disobedience in complying with the statutory requirements under Section 139 (1),
148 and 153 A of Income Tax Act, 1961, which amounts to an offence punishable
under Section 276 CC of Income Tax Act, 1961. Petitioner did not file the return of
income voluntarily, did not pay the advance tax and it is offence punishable under
Section 276 C (2) of Income Tax Act, 1961. Petitioner concealed his true and correct
income by not filing return of income, not paying the advance tax and the demand
tax. Thus, committed offence under Section 276 (C) (1), 276 C (2), 276 CC and 277
of the Income Tax Act, 1961. Petitioner made false statement and signed false
verification and it is an offence punishable under Section 277 of the Income Tax Act.
3.The general allegations remain the same in other cases and details of the
specific violation under Income Tax Act, 1961 are extracted in other cases as follows,
Petitioner failed to file the return of income for the assessment year 2003-2004.
He also did not pay advance tax and concealed true and correct income by not filing
the return of income on or before the statutory due date. Petitioner filed return of
income for the assessment year 2003-2004 only on 15.09.2004. A notice under
Section 153 (A) of income Tax Act was issued on 07.07.2006 to prepare a true and
Crl.O.P.Nos.29914, 29915, 29916, 29917, 29918 & 29919 of 2015
correct return of total income including the undisclosed income and that was
acknowledged by the petitioner on 22.07.2006. Petitioner did not file the return of
income and therefore a show cause notice dated 26.10.2006 was issued. Assessment
was completed on 24.09.2008 on a total income of Rs.1,93,82,227/-, taking into
consideration, the material seized. Total gross demand was determined at
Rs.1,26,05,955/-. The appeal filed by the petitioner was dismissed by a common
order on 31.03.2014. Tax recovery officer issued notices in ITCP – 1 to the petitioner
on 11.06.2014. Stay petition filed by the petitioner was dismissed by Income Tax
Appellate. Petitioner willfully failed to file return of income for the assessment year
2003-2004 and violated the provisions of Section 139 (1), 148 and 153 A of Income
Tax Act, 1961, punishable under Section 276 CC of Income Tax Act; did not pay the
advance tax and the demand raised under Section 144 r/w 153A, which amounts to
commission of offence under Section 276 C (2) of Income Tax Act; willfully and

the Income Tax Act, 1961.
Petitioner has not filed income return for the assessment year 2004-2005
Crl.O.P.Nos.29914, 29915, 29916, 29917, 29918 & 29919 of 2015
within the due date prescribed by the statute, did not pay the advance tax and failed
to file the return of income and thus concealed the true and correct income. Petitioner
filed return of income for assessment year 2004-2005 on 15.09.2004 showing only
NIL income. Based upon the information and materials gathered during search,
statutory notice under Section 153 (A) of Income Tax Act, 1961, dated 07.07.2006
was issued to the petitioner to prepare a true and correct return of total income
including the undisclosed income for the assessment year 2004-2005. It was
acknowledged on 22.07.2006. Petitioner did not file the return of              income          and
therefore, a show cause notice dated 26.10.2006 was issued. Based on search,
assessment was completed determining the net demand payable at Rs.2,11,32,637/-.
Penalty proceedings for concealment of income were initiated simultaneously. Appeal
was dismissed by a common order on 31.03.2014 and the assessment was confirmed.
Tax Recovery Officer issued notices in ITCP-1 to the defaulter on 11.06.2014. Stay
petition filed by the petitioner was dismissed by Income Tax Appellate Tribunal,
Chennai. Petitioner willfully failed to file return of income for the assessment year
2004-2005, willfully and deliberately did not pay the advance tax and demand raised
under Section 144 r/w. 153 A, willfully and deliberately concealed his true and
correct income, made false statement and signed false verification. Thus, petitioner
committed the offences punishable under Section 276 C (1), 276 C (2), 276 CC and
277 of the Income Tax Act, 1961.
Crl.O.P.Nos.29914, 29915, 29916, 29917, 29918 & 29919 of 2015
Petitioner did not file return of income for the assessment year 2005-2006
within the due dates prescribed by the statute. He did not pay the advance tax and
concealed true and correct income by not filing the return of income. He filed return
of income for assessment year 2005-2006 on 28.10.2005, showing loss of Rs.2crores.
Petitioner is entitled to claim of carry forward loss only if the return is filed on or
before the statutory due date. The return of income was treated as defective and
petitioner was directed to rectify the defects. However, petitioner did not rectify the
defects. The defective return filed on 28.10.2005 is non-est in law. Based upon
information and material gathered during search, statutory notice under Section 153
A of Income Tax Act, 1961 dated 07.07.2006 was issued calling the petitioner to
prepare a true and correct return of total income including the undisclosed income,
for the assessment year 2004-2005. It was acknowledged on 22.07.2006. Petitioner
did not file the return of income and therefore, a show cause notice under Section 153
A dated 26.10.2006 was issued. There was no reply. Based on the materials seized,
the     assessment    was   completed     determining        the    total   gross     demand       at
Rs.1,32,63,662/-. Penalty proceedings for concealment of income were initiated
simultaneously. Tax Recovery Officer issued notices in ITCP – 1, to the petitioner on
11.06.2014. Stay petition filed by the petitioner was dismissed by Income Tax
Appellate Tribunal. Petitioner willfully failed to file return, did not pay advance tax,
Crl.O.P.Nos.29914, 29915, 29916, 29917, 29918 & 29919 of 2015
demand raised under Section 144 r/w. 153 (A) of the Income Tax Act, concealed his
true and correct income, made false statement and signed false verification, thus he is
liable to be prosecuted for the offences punishable under Section 276 C (1), 276 C
(2), 276 CC and 277 of the Income Tax Act, 1961.
Petitioner did not file his return of income for the assessment year 2006-2007
within the due date prescribed by the statute. He did not pay the advance tax and
concealed true and correct income by not filing the return of income. A notice under
Section 153 (A) of Income Tax Act, dated 07.07.2006 was issued to the petitioner
calling upon him to prepare true and correct return of total income including
undisclosed income for assessment year 2006-2007. It was acknowledged on
22.07.2006. But the petitioner did not file the return and therefore show cause notice
under Section 153 (A) was issued. Based on the material seized, the gross amount
payable was determined at Rs.68,70,578/-. Penalty proceedings and concealment of
income were initiated. Appeal filed by the petitioner was dismissed by a common
order on 31.03.2014. Tax Recovery officer issued notices in ITCP – 1, to the
petitioner on 11.06.2014. The stay petition filed was dismissed by Income Tax
Appellate Tribunal. Petitioner violated statutory requirements under Section 139 (1)
Crl.O.P.Nos.29914, 29915, 29916, 29917, 29918 & 29919 of 2015
and 153 A of Income Tax Act, by not filing return of income, did not pay the advance
tax, demand raised under Section 144 r/w. 153 A, deliberately concealed true and
correct income by not filing the return of income, not paid the advance tax and
demand tax. Thus, he is liable to be prosecuted for the offences under Section 276 C
(1), 276 C (2), 276 CC and 277 of the Income Tax Act, 1961.
Petitioner has not filed income tax return for the assessment year 2009-2010
and concealed true and correct income by not filing the return of income. During the
course of assessment proceedings, the authorized representatives of the petitioner by
a letter dated 21.10.2011, requested the petitioner to disallow the expenses in
proportion. The assessment was completed on a total income Rs.21,69,157/- against
the admitted income of Rs.10,61,680/-. A net demand of Rs.7,81,980/- was raised.
Dis-allowance of various expenses claimed could not be substantiated by the
petitioner. Petitioner did not pay the amount raised. Tax Recovery Officer issued
notices in ITCP – 1 to the petitioner. Petitioner is an affluent person deriving income
from acting and direction of films. He willfully and deliberately attempted to evade
tax and interest. Thus, he is liable to be prosecuted for the offence under Section 276
C (1), 276 C (2), 276 CC and 277 of the Income Tax Act, 1961.
Crl.O.P.Nos.29914, 29915, 29916, 29917, 29918 & 29919 of 2015
8.Challenging these petitions, the aforesaid criminal original petitions have
been filed for quashing the proceedings.
9.Learned counsel for the petitioner assailed the taking cognizance of these
i)the complaint is pre-mature, when the proceedings before the department are
yet to conclude and reach finality.
ii)The assessment order passed by the Assessing Officer, confirmed by the CIT
(A) have been set aside by the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal declaring the
Assessment orders as null and void.
iii)the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal makes it clear that the petitioner is not
liable to pay any tax penalty or interest that could be chargeable or imposable under
the Income Tax Act by the department.
iv)When that be the case, and when there is no tax, penalty or interest
chargeable or imposable under the Act, prosecution under Section 276 C (1) of the
Act, cannot be sustained.
v)when there is no tax, penalty or interest payable by the petitioner, the
allegation of attempting to evade payment of such tax, penalty or interest under
Crl.O.P.Nos.29914, 29915, 29916, 29917, 29918 & 29919 of 2015
Section 276 C (2) of the Act, cannot be sustained.
vi)No prosecution under Section 276 CC of the Act, could be initiated for non
filing income tax return when the tax that could have become payable is less than
Rs.3000/-. In this case, petitioner would not be liable to be pay even a rupee and
therefore, prosecution under Section 276 CC cannot be maintained.
vii)Filing of false statement of verification cannot be sustained in this case as
the petitioner had not filed any return of income or has made a statement which could
be called as false. Thus, continuation of the proceedings against the petitioner would
only be an abuse process of law and therefore, learned counsel for the petitioner
prayed for quashing the proceedings in E.O.C.C.Nos.101, 102, 103, 104, 105 & 106
of 2015.
10.In response, learned Special Public Prosecutor appearing for the respondent
submitted that all these petitions are not maintainable and these petitions are filed
abusing process of Court. These complaints have been filed as an offshoot of survey
and search proceedings. But for the survey and search proceedings, the violations
committed by the petitioner would not have come to light and it would have resulted
in suppression of income and loss of revenue to the Government. These petitions have
been filed mainly on the reason that Income Tax Appellate Tribunal have held
assessments are null and void. However, it is submitted by the learned Special Public
Prosecutor for respondent that the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal has not
Crl.O.P.Nos.29914, 29915, 29916, 29917, 29918 & 29919 of 2015
adjudicated or given a finding on any of the grounds raised in the complaint. The
order was passed solely on technical ground that the assessments were time barred.
When the order was not passed on merits or grounds raised in the criminal complaint,
the quashment of the proceedings cannot be prayed. It has been consistently held by
the Courts that order of assessment by the Appellate authority, will not be a bar for
criminal prosecution, especially when no finding was given by the Appellate
Authority on the merits of the case. When the ingredients of offence are clearly made
out in the complaint to establish that the accused has committed the offence, the
complaint cannot be quashed.
11.Learned counsel for respondent relied on the following judgments reported
in 1984 AIR SC 1693 P.Jayappan Vs. S.K.Perumal, I.T.O, 1995 214 ITR 778
Radheshyam Kejriwal Vs. State of West Bengal and another in support of her
submissions.
12.Considered the rival submissions and perused the records.
13.It is seen from the submission made by the learned counsel appearing for
the parties, especially, learned counsel for petitioner that petitions for quashing the
proceedings in E.O.C.C.Nos.101, 102, 103, 104, 105 & 106 of 2015 have been filed
Crl.O.P.Nos.29914, 29915, 29916, 29917, 29918 & 29919 of 2015
mainly on the grounds that the proceedings before the department have not come to
conclusion and therefore, the filing of the complaint is pre-mature and that the
Income Tax Appellate Tribunal declared the assessment orders as null and void and
therefore, the prosecution of criminal cases would be an abuse process of law.
Learned counsel for respondent pressed into service the judgment reported in (2011)
3 SCC 581 Radheshyam Kejriwal Vs. State of West Bengal and another, when a
similar issue arose under Foreign Exchange Regulation Act, 1973 for the
consideration of Hon'ble Supreme Court, as to the continuance of criminal
proceedings after completion of adjudication proceedings. It was observed as follows,
26.We may observe that standard of proof in a criminal case is
much higher than that of the adjudication proceeding. The
Enforcement Directorate has not been able to prove its case in the
adjudication proceeding and the appellant has been exonerated on
the same allegation. The appellant is facing trial in the criminal
case. Therefore, in our opinion, the determination of facts in the
adjudication proceeding cannot be said to be irrelevant in the
criminal case. In the case of B.N. Kashyap (Supra), the full Bench
had not considered as to the effect of a finding of fact in a civil case
over the criminal cases and that will be evident from the following
"I must, however, say that in answering the question, I have only
referred to civil cases where the actions are in personam and not
those where the proceedings or actions are in rem. Whether a
Crl.O.P.Nos.29914, 29915, 29916, 29917, 29918 & 29919 of 2015
finding of fact arrived at in such proceedings or actions would be
relevant in criminal cases, it is unnecessary for me to decide in this
case. When that question arises for determination, the provisions
of Section 41, Evidence Act, will have to be carefully examined."
28. Mr. Malhotra submits that finding recorded in the adjudication
proceeding is not binding on the criminal proceeding as both the cases
have to be decided on the basis of the evidence therein. Reliance has
been placed on a decision of this Court in the case of Iqbal Singh
Marwah v.Meenakshi Marwah (2005) 4 SCC 370, relevant portion
"32. Coming to the last contention that an effort should be made to
avoid conflict of findings between the civil and criminal courts, it is
necessary to point out that the standard of proof required in the two
proceedings are entirely different. Civil cases are decided on the basis
of preponderance of evidence while in a criminal case the entire burden
lies on the prosecution and proof beyond reasonable doubt has to be
given. There is neither any statutory provision nor any legal principle
that the findings recorded in one proceeding may be treated as final or
binding in the other, as both the cases have to be decided on the basis
32.There are authorities of this Court in relation to the Income-tax
Act in this regard. The first in the series is the judgment of this Court in
the case of Uttam Chand and others vs. Income Tax Officer, Central
Circle, Amritsar (1982) 2 SCC 543 in which registration of firm was
Crl.O.P.Nos.29914, 29915, 29916, 29917, 29918 & 29919 of 2015
cancelled on the ground that it was not genuine and prosecution
initiated for filing false return. However, in appeal, the Income Tax
Appellate Tribunal reversed the finding and held the firm to be
genuine. Relying on that, this court quashed the prosecution inter alia
"1. Heard counsel, special leave granted In view of the finding
recorded by the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal that it was clear on
the appraisal of the entire material on the record and Shrimati Janak
Rani was a partner of the assessee firm and that the firm was a
genuine firm, we do not see how the assessee can be prosecuted for
filing false returns. We, accordingly, allow this appeal and quash the
prosecution.
33.In the case of G.L. Didwania and Another vs. Income Tax Officer
and Another 1995 Supp (2) SCC 724, on setting aside the order of
the assessing authority which led to the prosecution of the assessee
by the Income-Tax Appellate Tribunal, this Court held the
prosecution not permissible and while doing so observed as follows :
"4. In the instant case, the crux of the matter is attracted and whether
the prosecution can be sustained in view of the order passed by the
tribunal. As noted above, the assessing authority held that the
appellant-assessee made a false statement in respect of income of
M/s. Young India and Transport Company and that finding has been
set aside by the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal. If that is the position
Crl.O.P.Nos.29914, 29915, 29916, 29917, 29918 & 29919 of 2015
then we are unable to see as to how criminal proceedings can be
38.The ratio which can be culled out from these decisions can broadly
(i) Adjudication proceeding and criminal prosecution can be launched
(ii)Decision in adjudication proceeding is not necessary before
(iii)Adjudication    proceeding     and      criminal      proceeding         are
(iv)The finding against the person facing prosecution in the
adjudication proceeding is not binding on the proceeding for criminal
(v) Adjudication proceeding by the Enforcement Directorate is not
prosecution by a competent court of law to attract the provisions
of Article 20 (2) of the Constitution or Section 300 of the Code of
(vi)The finding in the adjudication proceeding in favour of the person
facing trial for identical violation will depend upon the nature of
finding. If the exoneration in adjudication proceeding is on technical
ground and not on merit, prosecution may continue; and
Crl.O.P.Nos.29914, 29915, 29916, 29917, 29918 & 29919 of 2015
(vii) In case of exoneration, however, on merits where allegation is
found to be not sustainable at all and person held innocent, criminal
prosecution on the same set of facts and circumstances can not be
allowed to continue underlying principle being the higher standard of
proof in criminal cases.
39.In our opinion, therefore, the yardstick would be to judge as to
whether allegation in the adjudication proceeding as well as
proceeding for prosecution is identical and the exoneration of the
person concerned in the adjudication proceeding is on merits. In case
it is found on merit that there is no contravention of the provisions of
the Act in the adjudication proceeding, the trial of the person
concerned shall be in abuse of the process of the court.
14.The reading of this judgment makes it clear that adjudication proceedings
and criminal proceedings can be launched simultaneously and they are independent
in nature to each other. The adjudication proceedings is not binding on the
proceedings for criminal prosecution. It may be relevant, if the adjudication
proceedings in favour of person facing the trial decided on merits and in favour of
him. However, if the exoneration in adjudication proceedings is on technical ground
and not on merit, the prosecution may continue.
15.In the judgment reported in 1984 AIR 1693 P.Jayappan Vs.
S.K.Perumal, it is observed that, pendency of re-assessment proceedings cannot act
Crl.O.P.Nos.29914, 29915, 29916, 29917, 29918 & 29919 of 2015
as bar to the institution of criminal proceeding and it cannot in such circumstances
amount to abuse of process of Court.
5.At the outset it has to be stated that there is no provision in law
which provides that a prosecution for the offences in question
cannot be launched until reassessment proceedings initiated against
the assessee are completed. Section 279 of the Act provides that a
person shall not be proceeded against for an offence punishable
under section 276C or section 277 of the Act except at the instance of
the Commissioner. It further provides that a person shall not be
proceeded against for an offence punishable under those provisions
in relation to the assessment for an assessment year in respect of
which penalty is imposed or imposable on him under clause (iii) of
sub-section (1) of section 271 has been reduced or waived by an
order under section 273A. The Commissioner has the power either
before or after the institution of proceedings to compound any such
offence. In this case it is not claimed that the Commissioner has not
initiated the proceedings for instituting the complaints. No other
legal bar for the institution of the proceedings is urged except stating
that in the event of the petitioner being exonerated in the
reassessment proceedings, the prosecutions may have to be dropped.
It is true that as observed by this Court in Uttam Chand & Ors. v.
Income-tax officer, Central Circle, Amritsar(1) the prosecution once
initiated may be quashed in the light of a finding favourable to the
assessee recorded by an authority under the Act subsequently in
respect of the relevant assessment proceedings but that decision is no
Crl.O.P.Nos.29914, 29915, 29916, 29917, 29918 & 29919 of 2015
authority for the proposition that no proceedings can be initiated at
all under section 276C and section 277 as long as some proceeding
under the Act in which there is a chance of success of the assessee is
pending. A mere expectation of success in some proceeding in appeal
or reference under the Act cannot come in the way of the institution of
the criminal proceedings under section 276C and section 277 of the
16.It is observed in 1995 214 ITR 778 Mad, Tip Top Plastic Industries Pvt.
Ltd. Vs. ITO, that assessment order in assessment proceedings is not a bar to launch
prosecution. When the records seized disclosed short statement of stocks, ITO is
entitled to proceed against the petitioners according to law, for assessment afresh and
also for prosecution. Setting aside the order of the ITO by the Tribunal and
remanding the matter for adequate opportunity to the company, in the absence of
definite finding by the Tribunal as to the correctness of the returns submitted by the
company, is not a bar for criminal prosecution.
7...............As stocks to the value of Rs. 4,93,177 are alleged to have
been concealed, the first respondent would allege that the income to
the abovesaid value has been suppressed and this will attract
punishment under sections 276C and 277 of the Act. But learned
senior counsel for the petitioners, Mr. V. Ramachandran, would
argue that only if the income-tax authorities find that the real income
was concealed and the return of income is false, the criminal court
Crl.O.P.Nos.29914, 29915, 29916, 29917, 29918 & 29919 of 2015
can find the petitioners guilty of the offence and, therefore, the
assessing authority has to find out whether the original assessment
submitted in October, 1981, for the period ended with March 31,
1981, is not correct. ….....Therefore, when the records seized
discloses short statement of stock, certainly the Income-tax Officer is
entitled to proceed against the petitioners-assessees according to
law, for the fresh assessment and also for prosecution. Hence, the
above decisions cited by learned senior counsel do not help the
petitioners to avoid the criminal prosecution.
8. The next line of argument of learned senior counsel for the
petitioners is that as the assessment order of the Income-tax Officer
has been set aside by the Income-tax Appellate Tribunal and the
Commissioner of Income-tax (Appeals) also has cancelled the penalty
order of the Income-tax Officer, the prosecution against the
petitioners is not sustainable and the same has to be quashed.
17.From the reading and understanding of the judgments aforesaid, it is made
clear that pendency of re-assessment proceedings are remanding matter for adequate
opportunity and that adjudication by Tribunal through adjudication proceedings are
not a bar for launching a criminal prosecution. Even if the adjudication proceedings
ended in favour of assessee, it can be taken in favour of assessee only if the
adjudication proceedings discussed all the issues raised in the complaint on merits
and gave its findings. If the adjudication proceedings were disposed on technical
Crl.O.P.Nos.29914, 29915, 29916, 29917, 29918 & 29919 of 2015
ground and not on merits, prosecution can continue and assessee/accused cannot take
advantage of the order passed in adjudication proceedings.
18.In the case before hand, common order passed in I.T.A.Nos.1858 to
1862/Mds/2014 for the assessment years 2002-2003 to 2006-2007 relatable to
E.O.C.C.Nos.101, 102, 103, 104, 105 of 2015, respectively is filed for the
consideration of this Court. The main ground taken before the Income Tax Appellate
Tribunal was that the assessment order was barred by limitation. The Income Tax
Appellate Tribunal after considering the submission of the counsel appearing for the
parties concluded that “We are of the opinion that assessments made by the
Assessing Officer for all these five assessment years, uniformly on 24.09.2008 are
bad in law for the reason that direction of the Assessing Officer for special audit was
served on the assessee on 25.01.2008 which must be considered for the purpose of
computing the limitation of time making assessment. In that case, direction of the
Assessing Officer was subsequent to the expiry of the due date for making
assessment. Further without prejudice, even with the date 25.01.2008, considered by
the Assessing Officer as the date of service of direction and not on 28.01.2008 as
considered by the CIT (A) is taken into account, still the assessments were not made
in the period specified under Section 153 B of the Act. Therefore, it was held that the
assessments for the five assessment years on 24.09.2008 are bad in law.
Crl.O.P.Nos.29914, 29915, 29916, 29917, 29918 & 29919 of 2015
19.Essentially, the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal disposed the appeals only
on the ground of limitation and not on merits. It is further observed that other
grounds relating to merits become an academic exercise, meaning that other issues
raised in the complaint, especially the allegations raised in the complaints with regard
to non filing of return of income, non payment of advance tax, non payment of the
tax demanded, suppression of true and correct income by not filing return of income
had not been considered by the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal. When the matter was
not decided on merits, but only on technical ground of limitation, this Court is of the
considered view, on the basis of the principles settled in (2011) 3 SCC 581
Radheshyam Kejriwal Vs. State of West Bengal and another, that petitioner
cannot seek to quash the proceedings in E.O.C.C.Nos.101, 102, 103, 104, 105 of
2015 on the ground that Income Tax Appellate Tribunal had set aside the assessment
orders.
20.It is seen from the complaint allegation that despite, giving notice, statutory
notice as detailed in the complaint, petitioner has not filed return, paid advance tax
and tax demanded, suppressed the real and true income by not filing the return in
time. These issues have to be necessarily tried before the Court. The assessment order
Crl.O.P.Nos.29914, 29915, 29916, 29917, 29918 & 29919 of 2015
relating to the assessment year 2009-2010 was not challenged before the Income Tax
Appellate Tribunal. Therefore, petitioner cannot seek aid of order passed by the
Income Tax Appellate Tribunal in I.T.A.Nos.1858 to 1862/Mds/2014. In this case
also there is allegation of non filing of return of income for the assessment year 2009-
2010, concealment of true and correct income by not filing return of income, non
payment of income despite issuance of notice. These violations are liable to be
prosecuted for the offences under Section 276 C (1), 276 C (2), 276 CC and 277 of
the Income Tax Act, 1961.
21.When it comes to quashing a criminal proceedings, it is very well settled
that uncontroverted averments in the complaint without any addition or subtraction
should be looked into to examine whether an offence can be made out are not. If that
yardstick is applied in this case, this Court is of the considered view that
respondent/complainant made out prima-facie case to proceed against the petitioner
for the offences alleged in the complaint. Section 278 (e) of the Income Tax Act,
1961, empowers the Court to presume culpable mental state of the accused, unless,
the accused shows that he had no such mental state with respect to the act charged as
an offence in the prosecution. In this view of the matter, this Court finds that
petitioner shall necessarily face the trial.

22.In fine, Criminal Original Petitions in Crl.O.P.Nos.29914, 29915, 29916,
29917, 29918 & 29919 of 2015 are dismissed. Consequently, connected
miscellaneous petitions stand closed.
