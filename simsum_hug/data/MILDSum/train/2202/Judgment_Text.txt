The  sole  question  which  arises  for  determination  in  this
appeal filed by the Insurance Company is whether directions can be
passed by the Court while determining compensation under the Motor
Vehicle Act, 1988 (hereinafter referred to as “the said Act”) in
the manner of a direction in perpetuity for continued maintenance
of a prosthetic limb for the injured claimant.
The respondent No.1 viz. Mukesh Kumar, was 19 years of age
permanent disability of his right lower limb, which was treated as
a 100% disability. An amputation     had to take place below the knee
of that limb. In the assessment made by the Motor Accident Claims
Tribunal (MACT), an amount of Rs.2 Lakhs was quantified towards
loss of amenities, life and disfigurement which would include the
expenses towards his prosthetic limb. On examination in appeal, the
learned   judge  of  the  High   Court  by   the  impugned  order   dated
04.11.2020 has passed directions in the following terms:
“7. With consent, the impugned award dated 22.01.2020
passed by the learned MACT in Petition No.129/2018, is
modified to the extent that the claimant/R-1 shall be
supplied a prosthetic limb of good quality which is
suitable and comfortable to him. It shall carry a lifetime
warranty. Should it be required to be replaced/ repaired at
any stage, the insurance company will do so. The insurer
will enquire from the victim, at least twice a year, as to
the working condition of the prosthetic limb, through his
e-mail address and telephone number, as well as through his
counsel’s e-mail address and telephone number. The details
/ R1’s       email address         Mobile No.     address
8. In case of any difficulty apropos the prosthetic limb,
the claimant may intimate the insurer through e-mail
addresses and/ or telephone numbers of three officers of
the insurer, as supplied to him. These details shall be
provided to the claimant within 2 weeks from today.
9. It will be open to the claimant to communicate the
quotation or estimate for a suitable prosthetic limb to the
insurance company at the e-mail addresses and telephone
numbers provided by the learned counsel for the insurer.
The impugned order is modified to this extent.”
Learned counsel for the appellant submitted that the consent
which was given was for modification of the impugned award and not
to carry a lifetime warranty, as there is
no such thing as a lifetime warranty for a prosthetic limb. Not
only that, the impugned directions require that if any, repair or
replacement  has  to  be  done,    the  same   should    be  done  by  the
Insurance Company and the insurer was required to inquire from the
victim at least twice a year as to the working condition of the
prosthetic  limb   with  an    email   address   and    telephone   number
specified. Thus, what has been directed by the High Court is a
continuing maintenance of the prosthetic limb to be monitored by
the Insurance Company. We may note that the aforesaid is the only
issue which is called upon by us to be examined.
We had stayed the operation of the aforesaid paragraphs by the
interim directions issued vide order dated 15.2.2021.
We are of the view, that the aspect discussed in the aforesaid
paragraphs could be made only a part of compensation, and not in
the  nature  of  continuing   directions.    In  this    behalf,  we  have
noticed a view taken by this Court vide order dated 06.8.2020 in
SLP(C)  No.8631/2020  where   the   same  learned    judge   has  taken  a
similar view and that aspect of the order was deleted at the motion
stage  without  notice  by   the  Bench   and   thus   we   considered  it
appropriate to issue notice to other side.
Learned counsel for the appellant has referred two judgments
of this Court before us in Nagappa v. Gurudayal Singh & Others,
(2003) 2 SCC 274 and Sapna V. United India Insurance Co. Ltd. &
Anr. (2008) 7 SCC 613 opining      that while determining compensation
under the said Act there is no provision providing for passing of a
further   award   once   the   final   award    is  passed.    The  future
eventualities are to be taken into consideration at that time. It
“23…. Future medical expenses required to be incurred
can be determined only on the basis of fair guesswork
after taking into account increase in the cost of
medical treatment.”
In our view, the process of determination of such compensation
cannot be by a continuing mandamus, in a colloquial sense, and the
determination must take place at one go.
The aforesaid principle is not even disagreed to or contested
by the respondents but what is submitted is that there must be a
provision    made   fixing   a   lump   sum    amount   for   maintenance/
replacement of the prosthetic limb, if necessary. We agree with the
submission and in a larger canvas consider it appropriate to direct
that in such kind of cases of providing facility of prosthetic
limb,    appropriate    amount    may   be    quantified    towards   such
We, thus, allow the appeal to the extent aforesaid and set
aside   the   paragraph   Nos.7,8   &  9   to   be   substituted   by  the
determination for maintenance/replacement of the prosthetic limb
while a quantification of the amount for compensation is being
The question which remains is whether we should remit this
case to the High Court to determine the amount afresh having laid
down the principles, or we should determine it ourselves. In the
given facts of the case, we do not consider it appropriate to remit
the case for fresh determination and instead take on the burden
ourselves to do complete justice.
In order to facilitate determination of the lump sum amount,
we call upon the learned counsel for respondent No.1 to file an
affidavit setting forth the cost of the prosthetic limb purchased
by  him  along  with   supporting    documents.  He   should  also  file
supporting documents of the company from which he purchased the
prosthetic limb, to show what kind of maintenance/replacement would
be required. On these documents being filed, we would determine the
On the other aspects the appeal stands disposed of.
Let the affidavit be filed within four weeks, as prayed for.
Reply to the same be filed within two weeks, thereafter.
List after six weeks.
The  grievance  of    the   Insurance   Company   arises  from  the
directions  passed  in   the   impugned  order,   more  specifically  in
paragraph Nos.8 to 10, opining that assistance of two semi-skilled
workers on the basis of minimum wages is to be provided to the
date  of the accident     for  the  rest   of  the
appellant’s life. In order to sub-serve the said direction, inter
alia, sum of Rs.60 Lakhs is required to be kept by the Insurance
Company  in   an  interest    bearing   deposit,   from   which    about
Rs.50,000/- per month would be generated as interest to meet the
expenses of the assistants. The directions are contained in the
8. Presently, the appellant may have the benefit of his
caring parents but they cannot be expected to be present
with him at all times, as they may be engaged in other
activities and/or be employed to make provisions for the
family’s needs. In the circumstances, the appellant shall
be paid compensation towards the procurement of the
assistance of two semi-skilled worker on the basis of
minimum wages, from the date of the accident and for the
rest of the appellant's life.
9. The arrears towards the same shall be paid by the
insurer, on the basis of notified minimum wage rates
applicable to a semi-skilled worker. The arrears shall be
deposited directly into the bank account of the appellant,
jointly operated by his parents, in a month’s time, along
with interest accrued thereon @ 9% p.a. Payments apropos
‘attendant charges’ in the future shall also be ensured by
the insurer. The current minimum wage rate of a semi-
skilled workman is approximately Rs.18,000/-. Accordingly,
Rs.36,000/- per month would be required to be paid to the
appellant.   These   rates    are  revised    twice   a   year.
Therefore,   prudently    provision   should    be  made    for
automatic crediting of the current and future wages into
the appellant’s bank account. Logically, the insurance
company should assure about Rs.50,000/- per month as DFR
interest. According to the current FDR rates, a deposit
Rs.60 lakhs is likely to fetch about Rs.50,000/- per month
as interest. Let Rs.60 lakhs be kept in an interest
bearing FDR by the insurer in its own bank. The interest
earned therefrom, shall be credited into the appellants’
account by the 10th day of each Gregorian calendar month,
on the basis of notified minimum wages for two attendants.
10. Should the minimum wages be subsequently enhanced to a
quantum which does not meet the interest generated from
the FDR, the insurer shall augment the deposit to meet the
shortfall. The insurer shall have a lien on the deposit,
which it shall encash on the demise of the claimant.
We have heard learned counsel for the parties and are of the
view that these directions are unsustainable.
The reason for the same is that they are contrary to the
judicial view adopted by this court in Nagappa v. Gurudayal Singh &
Ors.- (2003) 2 SCC 274, Sapna v. United India Insurance Company
Ltd. & Anr. (2008) 7 SCC 613 & The Oriental Insurance Co. Ltd. v.
Zakir Hussain & Ors. [SLP (C) No.12210/2020 dated 13.10.2020]. In
these  cases,  this Court   has   opined that  while  determining  the
compensation under the said Act there is no provision for providing
for passing of further award once the final award is made. The
future eventualities are to be taken into consideration at that
“However, it is to be clearly understood that the MV Act
does not provide for passing of further award after the final
award is passed. Therefore, in a case where injury to a
victim requires periodical medical expenses, fresh award
cannot be passed or previous award cannot be reviewed when
the medical expenses are incurred after finalisation of the
compensation proceedings. Hence, the only alternative is that
at the time of passing of final award, the Tribunal/court
should consider such eventuality and fix compensation
accordingly. No one can suggest that it is improper to take
into account expenditure genuinely and reasonably required to
be incurred for future medical expenses. Future medical
expenses required to be incurred can be determined only on
the basis of fair guesswork after taking into account
increase in the cost of medical treatment.”
The  aforesaid  aspect   has   been considered  by  us  today  in
another appeal filed by the same Insurance Company in SLP (C)
No.16077/2020 dealing with the aspects of provisions for prosthetic
limb. The principles which we have appreciated in the current case
as though it may not be strictly in the
nature of a continuing direction; but premised on the basis of a
continuing requirement, a lump sum amount has been directed to be
deposited the returns from which are to be utilised. We are of the
view that this is not the appropriate course to follow.
Learned counsel for the appellant has taken us through various
judicial pronouncements which show that the approach which has been
adopted by different courts is of giving a lump sum amount. The
moot point however remains as to how the lump sum amount is to be
We find that in case of extreme injuries affecting the mental
and physical abilities of a person, a similar approach has been
adopted by this Court in Kajal V. Jagdish Chand & Ors. (2020) 4 SCC
No doubt the factual matrix in that case painted a very grim
picture  of  young  girl  who  suffered   an  accident  and  as  result
thereof while physically she would age, her mental state would
remain under one year of age. In that scenario, a methodology was
suggested  to  apply  the  multiplier  method   while  determining  the
attendant   charges.   We  consider   it   useful   to  reproduce   the
22. The attendant charges have been awarded by the High
Court @Rs.2,500/- per month for 44 years, which works out
to Rs.13,20,000/-.Unfortunately, this system is not a
proper system. Multiplier system is used to balance out
various factors. When   compensation is awarded in lump sum,
various   factors   are   taken   into   consideration.  When
compensation is paid in lump sum, this Court has always
followed the multiplier system. The multiplier system
should   be   followed    not   only   for   determining  the
compensation on account of loss of income but also for
determining the attendant charges etc. This system was
recognised by this Court in Gobald Motor Service Ltd. v.
R.M.K. Veluswami (AIR 1962 SC 1).The multiplier system
factors in the inflation rate, the rate of interest payable
on the lump sum award, the longevity of the claimant, and
also other issues such as the uncertainties of life. Out
of all the various alternative methods, the multiplier
method has been recognised as the most realistic and
reasonable method. It ensures better justice between the
parties and thus results in award of ‘just compensation’
within the meaning of the Act.
23. It would be apposite at this stage to refer to the
observation of Lord Reid in Taylor v. O’Connor (1971 AC
"Damages to make good the loss of dependency over a
period of years must be awarded as a lump sum and that
sum is generally calculated by applying a multiplier to
the amount of one year's dependency. That is a
perfectly good method in the ordinary case but it
conceals the fact that there are two quite separate
matters involved, the present value of the series of
future payments, and the discounting of that present
value to allow for the fact that for one reason or
another the person receiving the damages might never
have enjoyed the whole of the benefit of the
dependency. It is quite unnecessary in the ordinary
case to deal with these matters separately. Judges and
counsel have a wealth of experience which is an
adequate guide to the selection of the multiplier and
any expert evidence is rightly discouraged. But in a
case where the facts are special, I think, that these
matters must have separate consideration if even rough
justice is to be done and expert evidence may be
valuable or even almost essential. The special factor
in the present case is the incidence of Income Tax and,
24. This Court has reaffirmed the multiplier method in
various cases like Municipal Corporation of Delhi v.
Corporation and Ors. v. Trilok Chandra and Ors. [(1996) 4
SCC 362], Sandeep Khanduja v. Atul Dande and Ors. [(2017) 3
SCC 351]. This Court has also recognised that Schedule II
of the Act can be used as a guide for the multiplier to be
applied in each case. Keeping the claimant’s age in mind,
the multiplier in this case should be 18 as opposed to 44
taken by the High Court.
25. Having held so, we are clearly of the view that the
basic amount taken for determining attendant charges is
very much on the lower side. We must remember that this
little girl is severely suffering from incontinence meaning
that she does not have control over her bodily functions
like passing urine and faeces. As she grows older, she will
not be able to handle her periods. She requires an
attendant virtually 24 hours a day. She requires an
attendant who though may not be medically trained but must
be capable of handling a child who is bed ridden. She would
require an attendant who would ensure that she does not
suffer from bed sores. The claimant has placed before us a
notification of the State of Haryana of the year 2010
wherein the wages for skilled labourer is Rs.4846/- per
month. We, therefore, assess the cost of one attendant at
Rs.5,000/ and she will require two attendants which works
out to Rs.10,000/ per month, which comes to Rs.1,20,000/-
per annum, and using the multiplier of 18 it works out to
Rs.21,60,000/-for attendant charges for her entire life.
This takes care of all the pecuniary damages.”
Learned counsel for the appellant did seek to persuade us that
this is not the only methodology available and it should not be
adopted. We are of the view that in cases where the degree of
disability is high, there is mental disability, it is a case of a
young  person  etc.  without   it  being  possible  to anticipate all
possibilities,   the   course    followed   aforesaid  would  be  the
appropriate course. We are not saying that the aforesaid can be the
only course, and in a different scenario, lump sum amount can be
assessed as has been as done in        Lalan D. @ Lal & Another v.
Oriental Insurance Company Limited, (2020) 9 SCC 805 and Parminder
Singh v. New India Assurance Company Limited & Others, (2019) 7 SCC
Learned Senior Counsel for the appellant also sought to point
out another course followed in Mallikarjun v. Divisional Manager,
suffering disability on account of      motor
vehicle accident, a broad principle was sought to be laid down in
“12. Though it is difficult to have an accurate assessment
of the compensation in the case of children suffering
disability on account of a motor vehicle accident, having
regard to the relevant factors, precedents and the approach
of various High Courts, we are of the view that the
appropriate compensation on all other heads in addition to
the actual expenditure for treatment, attendant, etc.,
should be, if the disability is above 10% and upto 30% to
the whole body, Rs.3 lakhs; upto 60%, Rs.4 lakhs; upto 90%,
Rs.5 lakhs and above 90%, it should be Rs.6 lakhs. For
permanent disability upto 10%, it should be Re.1 lakh,
unless   there   are   exceptional    circumstances    to   take
different yardstick. In the instant case, the disability is
to the tune of 18%. Appellant had a longer period of
hospitalization    for   about    two   months   causing    also
inconvenience and loss of earning to the parents.”
The aforesaid only shows that there is more than one option
available i.e, there may be a lump sum amount specified on general
principles as enunciated aforesaid; or in cases where the factual
scenario requires, same multiplier method can be followed as in the
case of Kajal (supra).
Now turning to the facts of the present case, the child was 11
years of age when he suffered functional disability which has been
assessed at 70% by the medical board and the tribunal, and which
the High Court determined as 100% functional disability. It is in
these  circumstances    that  the   direction   has   been   passed   for
attendants  with   a  methodology   of   accessing  the  minimum    wages
payable for two skilled workers. In the given factual scenario, we
are of the view that the apposite course to follow is set out in
Kajal’s case (supra).
On having reached that conclusion, the issue would be what
would be the lump sum amount to be determined to be paid on those
We find that in terms of the impugned order dated 08.12.2020,
the learned judge has since kept the matter pending by issuing the
notice to the GNCTD to examine whether there could be a Government
policy  in  regard  to  assistance    to   be  provided  to  permanently
disabled adolescents whose parents are not economically well off.
We are of the view that in pursuance to this conclusion, it is the
High  Court  which   ought  to   examine    as  to  what  would   be  the
appropriate   lump  sum   amount   to   be   determined   based  on   the
multiplier basis as set out in Kajal’s case (supra).
We, thus, set aside the directions contained in the impugned
order in paragraph Nos.8 to 10.
We also find that while seeking to examine the larger issues,
the learned judge has ventured into the aspect of Government policy
to be framed in that behalf. This really amounts to beyond the
jurisdiction   over  determination    of   the   amount,  in  the   Motor
Accident Claim proceeding, but on a larger canvas taking the colour
of a Public Interest Litigation. We, thus, consider it appropriate
that this aspect ought to be examined by the Bench dealing with the
Public Interest Litigation, as a larger canvas would have to be
determined rather than something restricted to the case of the
respondent before us.
The civil appeal is allowed in the aforesaid terms leaving
parties to bear their own costs.
