20.    Issue notice.
21.    Mr. Sagar Chandra, ld. Counsel accepts notice.
22.    The present suit has been filed by Plaintiff - Parle Products Private
Limited against the Defendant - Britannia Industries Ltd seeking permanent
injunction restraining disparagement, infringement, unfair competition, etc
regarding a video advertisement as also two print advertisements publicised
by the Defendant for its ‘Britannia Milk Bikis’ products.
23.    The case of the Plaintiff is that the Defendant is disparaging the
Plaintiff’s world famous biscuits product sold under the mark Parle-G by
publicizing    derogatory   advertisement      campaigns     through   television
commercials, online broadcasts as well as through Print media i.e. e-Paper
and print Newspaper. The disparaging advertisements include two print
advertisements and one video advertisement (“hereinafter collectively as,

impugned advertisements”). The Plaintiff submits that the impugned
advertisements are made in a manner so as to reflect the Plaintiff’s product
in a bad light by suggesting that the Plaintiff’s Parle-G biscuits give adhoora
poshan and are sadharan biscuits. The impugned advertisements are as

24.    It is submitted by the ld. Counsel for the Plaintiff that the use of the
letter ‘G’ in the print advertisements as also the use of a similar looking
packaging in the video advertisement leaves no manner of doubt that the
comparison of the Defendant’s ‘Britannia Milk Bikis’ product is being made
with the Plaintiff’s Parle-G product.
25.    After noticing the matter in the cause list, Mr. Sagar Chandra, ld.
Counsel has entered appearance for the Defendant. He is supplied with
complete set of suit papers including the plaint, applications and the
accompanying documents. Ld. Counsel has also made some submissions
after the passover was granted.
26.    Ld. Counsel for the Defendant submits that the impugned video
advertisement had been released by the Defendant in 2019 and the two print
advertisements are of recent origin. Ld. Counsel further submits that the
Defendant is willing to explore amicable resolution of the disputes.
27.    The Court has perused the impugned advertisements. A perusal of the
two print advertisements clearly shows that the use of the terms such as ‘G-
NAHI’, ‘Adhura poshan’, etc. clearly make a reference to the Plaintiff’s
Parle-G’s biscuits. This is also evidenced by the fact that the packaging with
which the Defendant’s product is compared in the impugned video
Digitally Signed        CS(COMM) 806/2022                                                          Page 7 of 8
advertisements is similar to the Plaintiff’s Parle-G product. It is noted that
the impugned video advertisement is available on YouTube.
28.    Considering that the Defendant is willing to amicably resolve the
matter, the parties are referred to the Delhi High Court Mediation and
Conciliation Centre (hereinafter "Mediation Centre") on 24th November,
2022 at 4:00 p.m. As requested, Mr. J.P. Sengh, ld. Senior Advocate, is
appointed as the ld. Mediator.
29.    It is directed that while the settlement is being explored between the
parties, the two print advertisements of the Defendant shall not be re-
published. In the process of mediation, the changes to be carried out in the
impugned video advertisement which is currently accessible online shall

who are competent to take decisions shall participate, either physically or
