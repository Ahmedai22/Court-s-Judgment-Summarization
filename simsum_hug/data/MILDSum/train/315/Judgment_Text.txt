      The petitioner has challenged one of the conditions contained
in the notification dated 05.09.2021, which pertains to holding of
the competitive examination for direct recruitment to the cadre of
District Judge, 2020. Under the notification in question, the High
Court has invited applications from eligible candidates for direct
recruitment to the post of District Judge.                    Paragraph 6 of this
notification requires the candidates to submit online application
along with certain documents. Clause (f) of paragraph 6, which is
under challenge, requires the candidates to supply certified copies
of those 10 judgments of which the candidate has furnished
                      (Downloaded on 04/01/2022 at 05:42:52 PM)
                                          (2 of 3)                   [CW-16652/2021]
particulars while submitting online application form. According to
the petitioner, this requirement is not part of the recruitment
rules, and therefore, cannot be inserted through the recruitment
notification.
      However, we notice that the recruitment and terms of
selection for direct recruitment to the post of District Judge are
governed by the Rajasthan Judicial Service Rules, 2010. Part-2 of
these rules pertains to direct recruitment.                     Rule 33 lays down
eligibility criteria for direct recruitment and essentially requires
that the candidate must have attained the age of 35 years and
must not have crossed the age of 45 years on the first day of
January following the last date fixed for the receipt of the
application and should have put in atleast seven years as an
Advocate. Rule 36(1) of the said rules pertains to submission of
application. Sub-rule (1) of Rule 36 reads as under:
       “36. Submission of application.- (1) While
       submitting     application,         candidate          shall    furnish
       particulars of 10 judgments of the preceding seven
       years. He shall produce the certified copies of such
       judgments before the Main Examination, as prescribed
       by the Recruiting Authority. The Candidate is required
       to provide particulars of final orders/judgments
       personally argued by him, not being interlocutory
       orders, bail orders, orders based on compromise or
       orders of withdrawal of case.”
      Sub-rule (1) of Rule 36 thus requires a candidate while
submitting the application to furnish particulars of 10 judgments
of preceding seven years. He also has to produce certified copies
of such judgments before conducting the main examination. He
has to provide particulars of final orders and judgments personally
argued by him which should not relate to interlocutory orders, bail
orders or orders based on compromise or withdrawal of cases.

                                                                          (3 of 3)                 [CW-16652/2021]
                                 Clause (f) of paragraph 6 of the main notification thus traces its
                                 root to Sub-rule (1) of Rule 36 of the said rules and is thus in
                                 consonance with the statutory recruitment rules. Rule 36(1) is not
                                 under challenge. The condition, therefore, cannot be set aside.
                                       The petition fails and is dismissed.
                                                      (Downloaded on 04/01/2022 at 05:42:52 PM)
