This appeal takes exception to the judgment and order
dated 19.10.2019 passed by the High Court of Judicature
at Allahabad in Criminal Misc. Bail Application No. 43427
of               2019   releasing  the   respondent   No.1   on   bail    in
connection with Case Crime No. 368 of 2019 registered at
P.S.               Moodhapandey,  Moradabad,    Uttar Pradesh   concerning
offence punishable under Section 376 of Indian Penal Code
and Sections 3 and 4 of the Prevention of Children from
We have heard learned counsel for the parties.
We are disturbed to notice the manner in which the
High Court has casually released the respondent No.1 on
bail   despite     having   noted    that   respondent    No.1  was
involved    in   other   serious    offences   and  had   committed
offence even while on bail.
In   terms    of  the   impugned    High   Court   order,  the
respondent     No.1   was   released    on   bail   but   has  been
arrested in connection with some other offence.
While issuing notice, we had made it clear that if
the respondent No.1 had not been released on bail in the
concerned case, shall continue to remain in jail till the
hearing of this appeal.
It is reported that respondent No.1 was released on
bail after the High Court order but came to be arrested
in  connection     with   some  other    offence.  That   makes  no
difference. In our opinion, the impugned judgment cannot
stand the test of judicial scrutiny.
We accordingly set aside the same and direct that
respondent No.1 shall remain in jail in connection with
Case    Crime     No.   368    of    2019   registered     at  P.S.
Moodhapandey,      Moradabad,     Uttar    Pradesh,    during   the
pendency of the trial of this case.
The only indulgence that can be shown to respondent
No.1 is to direct the Trial Court to ensure that the
subject trial is completed not later than end of March
2021 and submit compliance report in that regard in the
Registry of this Court.
The Criminal Appeal and pending application(s) are
disposed of accordingly.
