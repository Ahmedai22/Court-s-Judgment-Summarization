1.     Heard Sri. Ashok Kumar Dwivedi, learned Counsel for the Applicant
and learned AGA for the State-respondents.
2.     By means of the present application under Section 482 of the Criminal
Procedure Code the applicant has prayed for quashing of the charge sheet
dated 18.01.2007 in Criminal Case No. 305 of 2007 (State vs. Rakesh Kumar
Shukla) under Sections 504 and 506 IPC, Police Station Kotwali Nagar,
District Banda, pending in the Court of Chief Judicial Magistrate, Banda,
which has been instituted by an application under Section 156 (3) Cr.P.C.,
filed on 25-11-2006 by the opposite party number 2.
3.     The accused-applicant and the informant-opposite party no.2 are
neighbors. The applicant lives in House No. B-81 whereas the informant
lives in House No. B-82, Awas Vikas Colony, P.S. Kotwali, District-Banda.
The informant/respondent no.2 had filed an application under Section 156 (3)
Cr.P.C. against the applicant alleging that the applicant had fired at him with
the intention to kill him and when several persons from the locality gathered
there, he went away threatening to kill the informant. In furtherance of the
aforesaid application, a First Information Report was lodged. The applicant
had filed Criminal Misc. Application No. 15344 of 2006 and on 27.11.2006,
“Heard Sri R.R.Singh, counsel for the applicant and A.G.A.
Having heard the submissions and perusing the materials on record, this
application is finally disposed of with the direction that pursuant to the
impugned order dated 19.10.2006 passed by C.J.M., Banda on the
application of opposite party no.2 under Section 156 (3) Cr.P.C., if any case
has been registered against the applicant at P.S. registered against the
applicant at P.S. Kotwali, district-Banda, then investigation in the matter
may go on, but the applicant shall not be arrested till submission of the
report under Section 173(2), Cr.P.C. provided he cooperates with the
investigation.”
4.     An investigation was carried out pursuant to the aforesaid FIR and
statements of six witnesses were recorded. After completion of investigation,
the police has submitted the charge sheet no. 11/2007 on 18.11.2007 stating
that upon investigation, from the statements of the witnesses and inspection
of the site of occurrence, commission of the offence under Section 307 IPC
was not found and merely offences under Sections 504 and 506 IPC was
found to have been committed. The charge sheet has been forwarded to the
court for trial of the applicant.
5.     Sri Ashok Kumar Dwivedi, learned counsel for the applicant has
argued that although originally the first information report was lodged under
Sections 307, 504, 506 IPC but during investigation, the allegation of
commission of offence under Section 307 IPC was found to be false and only
a case under Sections 504 and 506 IPC was found to be made out against the
applicant, both of which are non-cognizable offences and, therefore, the case
against the applicant can only proceed as a complaint. In support of his
submission, he has invited attention of the Court to the Explanation appended
to Section 2 (d) of Cr.P.C. In order to appreciate his submission, the relevant
“(d) “complaint” means any allegation made orally or in writing to a
Magistrate, with a view to his taking action under this Code, that some
person, whether known or unknown, has committed an offence, but does
not include a police report.
Explanation.—A report made by a police officer in a case which
discloses, after investigation, the commission of a non-cognizable offence
shall be deemed to be a complaint; and the police officer by whom such
report is made shall be deemed to be the complainant”
6.     Ashok Kumar Dwivedi has placed reliance on a judgment of this Court
in Dr. Rakesh Kumar Sharma vs. State of U.P. and another reported in
2007 (9) ADJ 478, in which case originally the FIR was lodged under
Section 307. However, after investigation the Investigating Officer came to
the conclusion that no offence under Section 307 IPC was made out and only
a case under Section 504 IPC was made out against the accused and so a
charge sheet under Section 504 IPC was submitted against the applicant. In
this backdrop a coordinate Bench of this Court held that the Magistrate shall
not proceed with the case as a state case but he shall proceed with it as a
complaint case as provided in the explanation to Section 2(d) Cr.P.C.
7.     However, in the present case, apart from an offence under Section 504,
an offence under Section 506 IPC has also been found to have been
committed. Although in the first schedule appended to the code of criminal
procedure, 1973 Section 506 is mentioned to be a non-cognizable offence,
the Uttar Pradesh Government has issued a Notification No. 777/VIII-9 4(2)-
87, dated July 31,1989, published in U.P. Gazette, Extra Part-4, Section
(Kha), dated 2nd August, 1989 by which the Section 506 IPC was made
cognizable and non bailable.
8.     The aforesaid Notification No. 777/VIII 9-4 (2)-87 dated July 31,
1989, published in the U.P. Gazette, Extra, Part-4, Section (kha) dated 2nd
“In exercise of the powers conferred by Section 10 of the Criminal Law
Amendment Act, 1932 (Act No. XXIII of 1932) read with Section 21 of the
General Clauses Act, 1897 (Act No.10 of 1897) and in super session of
the notifications issued in this behalf, the Governor is pleased to declare
that any offence punishable under Section 506 of the Indian Penal Code
when committed in any district of Uttar Pradesh, shall notwithstanding
anything contained in the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (Act No.2
of 1974) be cognizable and non-bailable.”
9.     The aforesaid notification has been issued under Section 10 of the
Criminal Law Amendment Act, 1932 (Act No. 23 of 1932), which provides
as follows: “10. Power of State Government to make certain offences
(1) The State Government may, by notification4 in the Official Gazette,
declare that any offence punishable under section 186, 188, 189, 190,
228, 295A, 298, 505, 506 or 507 of the Indian Penal Code (45 of 1860),
when committed. in any area specified in the notification shall,
notwithstanding anything contained in the Code of Criminal Procedure,
1898 (5 of 1898), be cognizable, and thereupon the Code of Criminal
Procedure, 1898, shall, while such notification remains in force, be
deemed to be amended accordingly.
(2) The State Government may, in like manner and subject to the like
conditions and with the like effect, declare4 that an offence punishable
under section 188 or section 506 of the Indian Penal Code (45 of 1860),
shall be non-bailable.”
10.    The validity of the aforesaid Notification dated 31-07-1989 was
examined by a Division Bench of this Court in Virendra Singh versus State
of U.P., 2002 Indian Law reports Allahabad Series 653 2002 (2) UC 453 and
“6. Section 10 of the Criminal Law Amendment Act, 1932 does not give
power to the State Government to amend by a notification any part of the
Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973. Since the Code of Criminal
Procedure of 1898 has been repealed by Section 484 of the Code of
Criminal Procedure. Act, 1973 we are of the opinion that Section 10 of
the Criminal Law Amendment Act, 1932 has become redundant and
otiose. Hence in our opinion no notification can now be made under
Section 10 of the Criminal Law Amendment Act, 1932. Any such
notification is illegal for the reason given above. Hence we declare
notification No. 777/VIII-94(2)-87, dated July 31, 1989, published the
U.P. Gazette, Extra Part-4, Section (kha), dated 2nd August, 1989 by
which Section 506 I.P.C. was made cognizable and non-bailable to be
illegal. Section 506 I.P.C. has to be treated as bailable and non-
cognizable offence.”
11.    However, in the case of Meta Sewak Upadhyay versus State of U.P.,
1995 CJ (All) 1158, a Full Bench of this Court examined the validity of the
aforesaid Notification. It may be relevant to note that although the Full
Bench has at some places mentioned the date of the Notification as August 2,
1989, which is actually the date of publication of the Notification in the
Official Gazette and at some places the date of the Notification is mentioned
as July 31, 1989 but the contents of the Notification are the same as those
which have been reproduced above. The Full Bench held as follows: -
“61.There are two notifications of December 29, 1932 and August 2, 1989
which came to be issued in exercise of the powers conferred by Section 10
of the Act of 1932. Whereas, the first notification was made applicable
only to a few districts, mentioned therein, the second notification of
August 2, 1989 which was issued in super session of the notifications
earlier issued in this behalf, states that the Governor is pleased to declare
that any offence punishable under Section 506 of the Indian Penal Code
(IPC) when committed in any district of Uttar Pradesh, shall
notwithstanding anything contained in the Criminal Procedure Code,
1973, be cognizable and non-bailable. From the second notification it is,
therefore, clear that that was issued in super session of the notification of
December 29, 1932 and the effect of this notification is that the offence
punishable under Section 506, IPC when committed at any place through,
out the Uttar Pradesh, shall notwithstanding anything contained in the
Criminal Procedure Code, be cognizable and non-bailable. In the first
Schedule to the Criminal Procedure Code, 1973, the offence under
Section 506 IPC is described as non-cognizable and bailable, but by
virtue of Sec. 10 of the Act of 1932, the same has been declared for the
entire Uttar Pradesh as cognizable and non-bailable by the notification of
August 2, 1989. Sec. 10 of the Act of 1932 confers powers of the State
Government to declare by notification in the official Gazette that an
offence punishable under Section 506 IPC inter alia when committed in
any area specified in the notification, shall notwithstanding anything
contained in the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898, be cognizable and
non-bailable and thereupon the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898 shall
while such notification remain in force, be deemed to be amended
accordingly. The submission is that by the Act of 1932, an amendment was
made in the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898, which stood repealed by
virtue of Section 484 of Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973, which was
assented by the President of April 1, 1974. The Act of 1932 having been
passed simply to amend the Cr. P.C. of 1889, the argument of Sri Misra is
that the former could not survive beyond the life of the Cr. P.C. of 1898,
which came to an end after being repealed in April, 1974. In short, he
submits that the life of the Amending Act cannot be more that the
principal act and that the amending act is co-extensive and co-terminus
with the Principal Act and that Cr. P.C. of 1898 which was amended by
the Act of 1932, having been repealed in April, 1974, the Act of 1932
could not have survived thereafter. Sri Tulsi argues that it is a misnomer
to say that the Act of 1932 is simply an Amending Act. He submits that the
Act of 1932 is named as "The Criminal Law Amendment Act, 1932.”
because that has made some amendment in the general body of criminal
law and, in fact, the Act of 1932 is not only an Amending Act but a unique
blend of substantive law as well as of the provisions making an
amendment in the Cr. P.C., 1898 and that it having contained substantive
provisions as well, cannot be said to be co-terminus with the Cr. P.C. of
1898 in which certain amendments were made, says Sri Tulsi. From
perusal of the Act of 1932, the submission of Sri Tulsi appears to be
correct that the said enactment is not merely an Amending Act but that is
a blend of substantive provisions as well as the provisions amending Cr.
P.C. of 1898. So the Act of 1932 is still on the statute book,
notwithstanding the repeal of Cr. P.C. 1898.
62. Therefore, the contention of Sri Misra that impugned notification of
August 2, 1989, having been issued under a dead enactment is invalid,
has to be rejected.
Then Sri Trivedi whose assistance was sought by Sri R. R. Dwivedi
submits that Section 10 of the Act of 1932 is violative of Article 14 of the
Constitution, inasmuch as it is bereft of any guideline in respect of an
area to be specified in the notification. He submits that the State
Government is given free hand with unguided, unchannelised and
arbitrary power to issue notification for any area and, therefore, Section
10 suffers from the vice of excessive delegation. Section 10 of the Act of
"10 Power of Local Government to make certain offences cognizable and
non-bailable.-(I) The Local Government may, by notification in the local
official Gazette, declare that any offence punishable under Section 186,
188, 189, 190, 228, 295A, 298, 505, 506 or 507 of the Indian Penal
Code, when committed in any area specified in the notification shall,
notwithstanding anything contained in the Code Criminal Procedure,
1898, be cognizable and thereupon the Code of Criminal Procedure,
1898, shall, while such notification remains in force, be deemed to be
amended accordingly.
(2) The Local Government may, in like manner and subject to the like
conditions and with the like effect, declare that an offence punishable
under Section 188 or Section 506 of the Indian Penal Code shall be non-
12.    The Full Bench proceeded to hold that “Section 10 of the Act of 1932
and Notification No. 777/VIII-9-4 (2) (87) dated July 31, 1989 are valid.
13.    The aforesaid Full Bench decision in Meta Sewak Upadhyay (Supra)
has been approved by the Hon’ble Supreme Court in Aires Rodrigues versus
14.    The validity of the aforesaid notification dated 31 st July 1989 having
been upheld by a Full Bench of this Court in Meta Sewak Upadhyay (Supra)
and the Full Bench decision having been approved by the Hon’ble Supreme
Court in Aires Rodrigues (Supra), there is no doubt that an offence under
Section 506 IPC, if committed in the State of U.P. is a cognizable offence.
15.    Therefore,      the   contention     of    the   learned     counsel   for the
applicant/accused has been charged with commission of non-cognizable
offences only based on the decision in Dr. Rakesh Kumar Sharma (Supra), is
misconceived as in that case, the accused had been charged only with offence
under Section 504 IPC, which is a non-cognizable offence whereas in the
instant case, the applicant has been charged with the offences under Sections
504 and 506 IPC, one of which, i.e. the offence under Section 506 is a
cognizable offence.
16.    It is expressly provided in Sub-Section 4 of Section 155 Code of
“Where a case relates to two or more offences of which at least one is
cognizable, the case shall be deemed to be a cognizable case,
notwithstanding that the other offences are non-cognizable.”
17.   In view of the aforesaid provisions of law, since the accused had been
charged under Sections 504 and 506 IPC, he has to be tried for both the
offences in the manner prescribed for trial of cognizable offences.
18.   Therefore, the application lacks merit and it is accordingly rejected.
