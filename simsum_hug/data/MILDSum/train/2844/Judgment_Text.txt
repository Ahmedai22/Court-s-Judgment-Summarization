The present appeal is directed against the judgment dated
25.06.2018 passed by the High Court of Madhya Pradesh, Bench
at Gwalior in Crl. Revision No. 156 of 2009 upholding conviction
of the appellants for offence under Section 325 read with Section
149 of the IPC and sentence of one year RI and a fine of
Rs.500/­ and in default with imprisonment for one month.
The facts in brief which emanate from the record are that
the complainant had lodged a report against the appellants and
18 others on that basis FIR was registered on 27.11.2004 at
about 13.00 hours and a charge­sheet was submitted against
the appellants and 18 other accused persons under Sections
148, 294, 341/149, 325/149 (2 counts), 323/149 (4 counts),
324/149 and 427/149 of IPC. In the report it was stated by the
complainant that on 27.11.2004 at about 10.00 a.m. he and his
sons had gone to a village in order to lift the engine of a tractor
and when they were coming back after lifting the engine in their
tractor trolley, on the way 15­20 persons who were armed with
lathi and axe came there with a common object of eliminating
them and started beating his son Bachna with lathi and axe by
abusing him with filthy language. They were Mahendra Singh,
Roop Singh, Khilan Singh son of Halkai, Bhujbal and 10 to 12
other persons, whose names are not known to him.          The Trial
Court charge­sheeted 20 persons under Sections 148, 294,
341/149, 325/149 (2 counts), 323/149 (4 counts), 324/149 and
427/149 of IPC, which was denied by the accused persons.
The Trial Court by its judgment dated 12.11.2008, on the
basis of the evidence recorded, convicted the appellants under
Sections 148, 325/149 and 323/149 IPC.
It may be relevant to note that the charge­sheet was filed
implicating 20 accused persons who faced trial and the learned
Trial Court acquitted 17 out of 20 accused persons who faced
trial and three accused persons were finally convicted under
Sections 148, 325/149 and 323/149 IPC.        It may be relevant to
note that one of the accused persons who were convicted,
namely, Sardar Singh, expired during pendency of criminal
revision before the High Court and qua him the revision was
dismissed as having abated by order dated 20.04.2011.
The judgment dated 12.11.2008 came to be confirmed on
appeal being preferred by the present appellants before the
learned 3rd Additional Sessions Judge, Vidisha by judgment
dated 24.02.2009 and the criminal revision petition preferred at
the instance of the appellants came to be dismissed under the
impugned judgment dated 25.06.2018.
Learned counsel for the appellants submits that the charge­
sheet was originally filed against 20 persons and all of them
faced trial and 17 out of 20 accused persons were acquitted by
the learned Trial Court by judgment and order dated 12.11.2008
and no further appeal/revision was preferred by the prosecution
against the judgment of acquittal passed by the Trial Court
against those 17 accused persons who faced trial and 3 out of 20
accused persons were convicted for offence under Sections 148,
325/149 and 323/149 IPC and it is not the case of the
prosecution that there were other unnamed/unknown persons
who could not be traced/charged other than the persons who
faced trial.
Counsel for the appellants submits that ingredients of
Section 149 of an unlawful assembly that this membership must
be five or more and in the instant case out of 20 accused
persons who faced trial, three have been convicted by the
learned Trial Court under the judgment dated 12.11.2008 under
Sections 148, 325/149 and 323/149 IPC and the essential
condition of unlawful assembly is that it must be of five or more
persons, as contemplated under Section 141 IPC. Taking
assistance thereof, counsel submits that the conviction under
the impugned judgment of the appellants under Sections 325
with the aid of Section149 IPC is unsustainable in law.
Counsel for the respondent, while supporting the judgment
impugned submits that 20 persons were charge­sheeted who
faced trial and thus merely because final conviction was of three
accused persons under Sections 325 with the aid of Section 149
IPC, the requirement of Section 141 which contemplates
unlawful assembly of five or more persons is being completely
meted out and after the matter has been examined by the Court
below on merits upholding conviction of the present appellants,
it needs no interference by this Court.
We have heard counsel for the parties and with their
assistance perused the material placed on record.
The legal position in regard to essential ingredients of an
offence referred to in Section 149 are not in doubt. Section 149
prescribes for vicarious or constructive criminal liability for all
members     of an    unlawful assembly    where   an  offence    is
committed by any member of such an unlawful assembly in
prosecution of the common object of that assembly or such as
the members of that assembly knew to be likely to be committed
in prosecution of that object.
It may be noticed that the essential ingredients of Section
149 are that the offence must have been committed by any
member of an unlawful assembly, and Section 141 makes it
clear that it is only where five or more persons constituted an
assembly that an unlawful assembly is born, provided, of course,
the other requirements of the said section as to the common
object of the persons composing that assembly are satisfied. To
say in other words, it is an essential condition of an unlawful
assembly that its membership must be five or more.
At the same time, it may not be necessary that five or more
persons necessarily be brought before the Court and convicted.
Less than five persons may be charged under Section 149 if the
prosecution case is that the persons before the Court and other
numbering in all more than five composed an unlawful
assembly, these others being persons not identified and un­
named.
However, in the instant case, the persons are specifically
named by      the complainant     and against them, after     the
investigation, charge­sheet was filed and all the 20 accused
persons faced trial.
It was not the case of the prosecution that there are other
unnamed or unidentified persons other than the one who are
charge­sheeted and faced trial.      When the other co­accused
persons faced trial and have been given benefit of doubt and have
been acquitted, it would not be permissible to take the view that
there must have been some other persons along with the
appellant in causing injuries to the victim.     In the facts and
circumstances, it was as such not permissible to invoke Section
The appellants may be held responsible for the offence, if
any, which could be shown to have been committed by them with
regard to the participation of others but that was not the case of
the prosecution.
In the given facts and circumstances, in our considered
view, the conviction of the present appellants under Section 325
with the aid of Section 149 IPC at least could not have been
invoked.
That apart, the appellants have also undergone three
months of substantive sentence during pendency of trial/appeal
before the Courts below.
Consequently, the appeal succeeds and is accordingly
allowed. The judgment of the Trial Court dated 12.11.2008
convicting the appellants under Sections 148, 325/149 and
323/149 IPC, which came to be confirmed by the High Court
under    its  revisional   jurisdiction    in   Criminal   Revision
No.156/2009 is hereby quashed and set aside.
Pending application(s), if any, shall stand disposed of.
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Crl.)    No(s).   6530/2018
(Arising out of impugned final judgment and order dated 25-06-2018
in CRLR No. 156/2009 passed by the High Court Of M.P At Gwalior)
Date : 05-01-2022 This matter was called on for hearing today.
UPON hearing the counsel the Court made the following
Leave granted.
The appeal is allowed in terms of the signed order.
Pending application(s), if any, shall stand disposed of.
