[Court hearing convened via video-conferencing mechanism on account of COVID-19]
1.     This writ petition is directed against the order dated 14.06.2021,
passed by the Central Administrative Tribunal [hereafter referred to as “the
Tribunal”] in O.A.No.53/2021 [in short “OA”]
2.     The petitioner had approached the Tribunal to assail the decision of
respondent no.1/Department of Personnel & Training (DoPT) dated
09.09.2020, whereby her candidature for Civil Services Examination, 2019
[in short “CSE 2019”] was cancelled.
2.1.   According to the petitioner, she became aware of her candidature
being cancelled only when she received information on 11.12.2020, in
Digitally Signed By:PREM W.P.(C)No.6932/2021                                                      Pg. 1 of 15
response to her application filed under the Right to Information Act, 2005,
dated 01.12.2020.
3.     Shorn of unnecessary details, the petitioner‟s candidature, as per the
respondents, stood cancelled for two reasons :
(i)    First, she had failed to submit the requisite Income and Asset
Certificate [in short “I&A Certificate”] before the stipulated deadline.
(ii)   Second, the I&A Certificate filed by the petitioner, albeit after the
deadline stipulated, disclosed that she did not meet the eligibility criteria for
securing the post under the Economically Weaker Section (EWS) category.
3.1.   What is not in dispute is that the petitioner, to take the benefit of
reservation under the EWS category, would have had to demonstrate that her
family had a gross annual income below Rs.8 lakhs and that insofar as CSE
2019 was concerned, the applicable financial year [in short „FY‟] was 2017-
18 [ assessment year (AY) 2018-19].
3.2.   It is also not in dispute that the provisions of the Office Memorandum
(OM) dated 31.01.2019 read with the OM dated 19.01.2019 applied to the
petitioner.
3.3.   As per the aforementioned OM, concededly, the expression „family‟
includes the person seeking the benefit of the reservation, his/her parents
and siblings below the age of 18 years, as also his/her spouse and children
below the age of 18 years.
4.     With this preface, the following broad facts are required to be noticed.
4.1.   The petitioner had sat for CSE 2019. The petitioner cleared, both the
preliminary and the main examination as well as the interview. The
Digitally Signed By:PREM W.P.(C)No.6932/2021                                             Pg. 2 of 15
petitioner secured 65th rank in the merit list, and was, consequently,
recommended by respondent no.2 i.e., Union Public Service Commission
(UPSC) for allocation of service.
4.2.   Concededly, the petitioner in the first instance, albeit, after the
preliminary examination was held, erroneously submitted the I&A
Certificate for F.Y. 2018-19 dated 24.06.2019.
4.3.   After the result for the main examination was declared (which was
published on 14.01.2020), UPSC, via an e-mail dated 25.02.2020, informed
the petitioner that a discrepancy had been noticed in her detailed application
form [in short “DAF”] concerning the I&A Certificate submitted by her. It
was pointed out that the I&A Certificate issued to her was not for F.Y.2017-
18; which was the relevant F.Y. for which the I&A Certificate was required
to be appended to the DAF.
4.4.   Via a communication dated 02.03.2020, UPSC wrote to the petitioner
that while verifying her documents for the personality test, it was noticed
that she had not produced the I&A Certificate for F.Y.2017-18.
Accordingly, it was conveyed to the petitioner that her candidature for CSE
2019 was provisional; an aspect which was explained to her in person, as
well by the concerned officer. The aspect involving the fact that she had
submitted an undertaking to submit the requisite document in original form
within 15 days of verification, failing which her candidature would stand
cancelled, was also conveyed to the petitioner.
4.5.   It appears that the petitioner was unable to obtain the I&A Certificate
for F.Y.2017-18, within the stipulated period of 15 days, and, therefore,
despite her undertaking, she shot off an e-mail dated 17.03.2020 to
respondent no.1 with a copy to UPSC, whereby she contended that as per the
Digitally Signed By:PREM W.P.(C)No.6932/2021                                           Pg. 3 of 15
gazette notification issued for CSE 2019, she was required to submit the
I&A Certificate for the F.Y. 2018-19.
4.6.     On account of the coronavirus pandemic, the UPSC deferred the
personality tests which were scheduled between 23.03.2020 to 03.04.2020,
till further orders.
4.7.    Given this position, on 02.08.2020, the petitioner, via yet another e-
mail, called upon the respondents to consider the I&A Certificate of
F.Y.2018-19, as due to the coronavirus outbreak, she was unable to obtain
the I&A Certificate for F.Y.2017-18.
5.      The record shows that UPSC had taken out a general notice on
06.08.2020, requiring candidates who had been provisionally recommended
by UPSC to submit requisite documents urgently, to enable the inclusion of
their names, for service allocation.
5.1.     On 13.08.2020, respondent no.1 wrote to the petitioner, and thereby
highlighted the fact that she has to submit the I&A Certificate for F.Y.2017-
18, latest by 20.08.2020.
5.2.    Since the petitioner was unable to secure the I&A Certificate for
F.Y.2017-18 by 20.08.2020, on the very same date, she wrote to respondent
no.1 that she would require further time to cure the deficiency. The
petitioner, accordingly, sought an extension of time, by at least one month.
In response to this communication, respondent no.1, via letter dated
27.08.2020, wrote to the petitioner that she should submit her I&A
Certificate concerning F.Y.2017-18, without fail, on or before 31.08.2020.
5.3.    The petitioner, on 31.08.2020, reiterated the stand taken by her in her
earlier communication, which was, that respondent no.1 should consider the
I&A Certificate already submitted by her for F.Y.2018-19.
Digitally Signed By:PREM W.P.(C)No.6932/2021                                           Pg. 4 of 15
5.4.   The record shows that the petitioner, ultimately, submitted the I&A
Certificate for F.Y.2017-18 on 24.09.2020.
5.5.   Thereafter, the petitioner entered into correspondence with respondent
no.1 concerning the purported failure on the part of respondent no.1 to
allocate appropriate service to her. In this context, reference is made to
correspondence dated 09.10.2020 and 04.11.2020.
5.6.   According to the petitioner, she met the Additional Secretary (AIS)
even in-person on 06.11.2020, who assured her that the matter would be
looked into.
5.7.   Since the petitioner did not get any reply to her entreaties, she adopted
the RTI route on 01.12.2020. As per the petitioner, as noticed hereinabove, it
is only when a response was received to her RTI application on 11.12.2020,
she obtained information that her candidature had been cancelled on
5.8.   Consequently, the petitioner approached the Tribunal and instituted an
action in and around 08.01.2021.
6.     The original application filed by the petitioner was numbered as O.A.
6.1.   The petitioner averred that, even before she approached the Tribunal,
four service allocation lists had been released qua CSE 2019, and while the
matter was pending in the Tribunal, the fifth and sixth service allocation lists
were released, whereby service was allocated to the candidates in the
reserved list i.e., those who were not declared as successful candidates in
CSE 2019 final result (which was declared on 04.08.2020).
6.2.   The Tribunal, as noticed right at the outset, vide order dated
14.06.2021, dismissed the petitioner‟s O.A.
Digitally Signed By:PREM W.P.(C)No.6932/2021                                           Pg. 5 of 15
6.3.   It is in this backdrop that the instant writ petition has been filed.
7.     Arguments on behalf of the petitioner were advanced by Mr J. Sai
Deepak, while arguments on behalf of respondent no.1 were addressed by
Mr Ripudaman Bhardwaj. The UPSC was represented by Mr Naresh
8.     Mr J. Sai Deepak has, broadly, made the following submissions:
(i)    Although the petitioner had submitted the I&A Certificate for the
correct financial year i.e., F.Y.2017-18 after the extended deadline i.e.,
31.08.2020, the petitioner‟s case ought to have been considered favourably,
as relaxation had been given in the case of several other candidates.
(ii)    The purpose of the I&A Certificate was to determine the economic
status of the candidate in a particular period, and, therefore, the mere fact
that the submission of the certificate for the concerned period was late,
should not come in the way of the petitioner‟s I&A Certificate being
considered, despite the delay.
(iii)  The petitioner is a person who does not possess economic
wherewithal; something which is evident if one were to take into account the
fact that she had secured a merit-cum-means scholarship between
24.07.2012 and 30.06.2016 while she was undertaking her studies in the
Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi. The merit-cum-means scholarship
was given to candidates whose annual family income was below Rs.4.5
lakhs.
(iv)   The petitioner‟s father had initially filed his income-tax return (ITR)
for F.Y.2017-18 (A.Y.2018-19), wherein he had shown his total gross
Digitally Signed By:PREM W.P.(C)No.6932/2021                                              Pg. 6 of 15
income as Rs.3,81,972, which was revised on 21.09.2020 and consequently,
his income was pegged at Rs.1,04,863. Therefore, if the revised income of
the petitioner‟s father along with that of the petitioner is taken into account,
which was disclosed for the same period i.e., F.Y.2017-18 (A.Y.2018-19) as
Rs.5,75,185, the petitioner meets the family income eligibility criteria
stipulated in OM dated 31.01.2019.
(v)    The income of an applicant seeking the benefit of reservation under
EWS can only be ascertained by the concerned Tehsildar. Respondent no.1
erred in involving the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) to ascertain
whether the petitioner fulfilled the income eligibility criteria stipulated in the
OM dated 31.01.2019.
Submissions on behalf of the contesting respondent i.e., respondent no.1
9.     Mr Bhardwaj, on the other hand, advanced the following submissions:
(i)    Apart from the fact that the petitioner had not submitted the I&A
Certificate for F.Y. 2017-18, despite extensions, by the given date i.e.,
31.08.2020, her candidature could not be considered as she did not meet the
income eligibility criteria stipulated in the OM dated 31.01.2019.
(ii)    The instances adverted to by the petitioner where I&A Certificate
was accepted after 31.08.2020 were distinguishable on facts. For this
purpose, our attention was drawn to paragraphs 27 and 33 of the reply filed
on behalf of respondent no.1.
(iii)  As regards the other aspect, which is, that the petitioner did not meet
the income eligibility criteria for getting the benefit of EWS reservation, it
was submitted that because the petitioner realized that the cumulative family
income for F.Y.2017-18 would be above the eligibility criteria [i.e. Rs.8
Digitally Signed By:PREM W.P.(C)No.6932/2021                                             Pg. 7 of 15
lakhs and above], the father of the petitioner, on 21.09.2020, filed a revised
return. It was contended that, clearly, this was done to get around the income
eligibility criteria, which is stipulated in the OM dated 31.01.2019.
(iv)   Furthermore, the information placed on record by the petitioner under
orders passed by this court would show that, for A.Y. 2016-17 and A.Y.
2017-18, the petitioner‟s father‟s income was shown as Rs.2,76,480 and
2,83,990 respectively. Likewise, for A.Y.2018-19 (F.Y.2017-18), in the first
instance, the petitioner‟s father disclosed his income as Rs.3,81,972, which
was deliberately scaled down to Rs.1,04,863.
(v)    Besides this, what is required to be borne in mind is that for
verification as to whether or not the candidates fulfilled the income
eligibility criteria for reservation under the EWS category, the cadre
controlling authority sought the assistance of the CBDT. This power was
exercised by respondent no.1, in consonance with provisions of Rule 20 of
the CSE Rules, 2019. Therefore, the argument of the petitioner that
respondent no.1 had to treat the I&A certificate issued by the Tehsildar as
the gospel truth, is misconceived.
(vi)   Lastly, the Court would have to bear in mind the fact that the benefit
of reservation under the EWS category would necessarily have to go to
those who meet the criteria, and while carrying out this exercise, it will have
to exclude those who try to manipulate their economic status.
Analysis and reasons:-
10.    We have heard the learned counsel for the parties and perused the
record.
11.    As noticed above, the fact that the petitioner passed the CSE 2019 and
Digitally Signed By:PREM W.P.(C)No.6932/2021                                           Pg. 8 of 15
11.1. It is also not in dispute that the petitioner had applied under the EWS
category.
11.2. Therefore, insofar as the present matter is concerned, all that one has
to look at, shorn of any backstory, which cannot be verified by us and
importantly cannot have any impact on the outcome of the present writ
action, are the following two aspects:
(i) Whether the petitioner had submitted the I&A Certificate for the
relevant period i.e., F.Y. 2017-18, before the prescribed deadline?
(ii) Whether the petitioner met the income eligibility criteria stipulated in
the OM dated 31.01.2019?
12.     Insofar as the first aspect is concerned, as discussed above, the
petitioner, for whatever reason, was not able to meet the extended deadline
fixed for submission of the correct I&A certificate for the F.Y. 2017-18 by
12.1. Admittedly, the petitioner submitted the said certificate only on
24.09.2020; by which date, the petitioner‟s candidature had already been
cancelled on 09.09.2020.
12.2. Qua this aspect, the petitioner had referred to the relaxation granted
by respondent no.1, vis-a-vis other candidates. Respondent no.1‟s
explanation vis-a-vis those cases has been given in paragraphs 27 and 33 of
their reply. For the sake of convenience, the same is extracted hereafter:
“27. In this regard, it is informed that in the final results of CSE 2019
declared on 04.08.2020, UPSC had recommended 79 EWS
candidates. Out of these 79 candidates, 75 candidates submitted their
I&A Certificate for FY-2017-18 before 31.08.2020. 2 candidates
informed that their family income from all sources exceeds Rs 8 lakh
Digitally Signed By:PREM W.P.(C)No.6932/2021                                              Pg. 9 of 15
for FY-2017-18 and they are not able to submit the requisite
certificate. One candidate viz. Ms. Nivedita Dutta intimated vide
email dated 07.09.2020 that she will be able to submit the requisite
I&A certificate for FY-2017-18 by 08.09.2020. Also, as per
information received from CBDT her annual family income was less
than Rs 8lakh for the FY-201718. So, her candidature was kept
provisional and was cleared after the receipt of the relevant I & A
Certificate for the FY 2017-18.
33. In respect of aforesaid four candidates, kind attention of the Hon'ble
High Court is drawn on case of each of the four provisionally
recommended candidates and action taken in their cases as below:
(a) Case of Ms. Polumati Saranya:
Candidate vide email dated 01.09.2020 had informed she will submit a
fresh affidavit with regards to her father's name shortly. Based on the
above mail she was once again requested to submit the certificates
before the 07.09.2020. However, her certificate was received on
11.09.2020 and her provisional candidature was cleared.
(b) Case of Mr. Mohammed Yakub:
Candidate was intimated several times to submit the requisite OBC
certificate as his candidature was also provisional. However, as he was
not able to submit the requisite documents by 03.11.2020 (i.e. 3 months
after the date of publication of final result) his candidature was cancelled
with the approval of the Competent Authority.
The candidate was later recommended under General category in the
Reserve List by UPSC; however, he was not allocated any service
because of Limited Preference. A Limited Preference candidate is one
who does not opt for all of the participating services for a given Civil
Services Examination, for consideration during his/her Service
allocation and could not be allocated to any of his/her preferred services
on the basis of his merit and service preferences due to non availability
of vacancies in those preferred participating services at the time of
his/her Service Allocation. Rule 2 of CSE - 2019 provides that :-
"(2) In case of recommendation of candidature by UPSC for
Service Allocation, the candidate shall be considered by the
Digitally Signed By:PREM W.P.(C)No.6932/2021                                               Pg. 10 of 15
Government for allocation to one of those Services for which
the preference has been indicated by the candidate in the on-
line Detailed Application Form-II subject to fulfilment of other
conditions. No change in preferences for Services once
submitted by a candidate would be permitted. In case
preference for none of the Services is indicated, the candidate
will not be considered for Service Allocation.”
(c) Case of Ms. Nivedita Dutta
Candidate vide email dated 07.09.2020 had informed that she will
submit fresh EWS certificate by 09.09.2020. Also, as per information
received from CBDT her annual family income was less than Rs 8 lakh
for the FY-2017-18. So, her candidature was kept provisional and was
cleared after the receipt of the relevant I & A Certificate for the FY
12.2(a)    In the case of the petitioner, the following (more elaborate)
submission is made in para 33(d) of the counter-affidavit.
"(d) Case of Ms.Aashima Goyal
Ms Aashima Goyal vide letter dated 31.08.2020 received on mail
requested for acceptance of I & A Certificate for FY- 2018-19. Besides,
her annual family income was found to be more than the benchmark
limit of Rs 8 lakh for the FY 2017-18 as ascertained from the documents
received from CBDT. Also, she was not recommended under General
Merit category whereby she could have been considered at par with
unreserved candidates.
As her annual family income was found to be more than the benchmark
limit for the relevant FY 2017-18, her candidature was cancelled with
the approval of the competent authority before the expiry of 3 months
from the date of publication of the final result as was done in the case of
12.3       A careful perusal of the aforementioned extract would show
that there was a hiccup in four cases; out of which in two cases
candidates were not able to meet the family income criteria and hence
Digitally Signed By:PREM W.P.(C)No.6932/2021                                             Pg. 11 of 15
they were not considered, while in the remaining two cases i.e., in the
case of Ms Polumita Saranaya and Ms Nivedita Dutta, respondent no.1
permitted submission of the I&A Certificate after the prescribed
deadline. However, in these two cases, there was no issue about the
concerned persons not meeting the family income eligibility criteria. In
sum, all those who were finally selected had family income below Rs.8
lakhs, as provided in the OM dated 31.01.2019. Therefore, even if we
were to consider the petitioner‟s case for relaxation, despite her
undertaking that she would meet the deadline; before any relief can be
granted in her favour, we would have to conclude that she met the
income eligibility criteria prescribed in the OM dated 31.01.2019.
13.        This brings us to the second aspect.
13.1.      Importantly, what is not disputed by the petitioner is that, in the
relevant period i.e., F.Y. 2017-18 (A.Y. 2018-19), she had earned an
income of Rs.5,75,185.
13.2.      It is also not in dispute that, in the first instance, the petitioner‟s
father had filed his ITR for F.Y. 2017-18 (A.Y. 2018-19) on 24.07.2018.
In this ITR, the petitioner‟s father disclosed that he had earned an income
of Rs.3,81,972. Concededly, if this return of the petitioner‟s father is
taken into account, and the ITR of the petitioner for the same period was
factored in, the combined income of the family would be Rs. 9,57,157.
In other words, the petitioner, undoubtedly, would not meet the income
eligibility criteria, as prescribed in the aforementioned OM.
13.3.      The petitioner, however, has relied upon her father‟s revised
return for F.Y. 2017-18 (A.Y. 2018-19), which, apparently was filed on
21.09.2020 and disclosed an income of Rs.1,04,863.
Digitally Signed By:PREM W.P.(C)No.6932/2021                                               Pg. 12 of 15
13.4.      It is important to note that the petitioner had disclosed the
family income along with DAF-II, which was filed after she cleared the
main examination. The family income disclosed in the EWS Annexure,
appended to DAF-II, was Rs.7,55,839, wherein the petitioner‟s father
income was disclosed as Rs. 4,39,323 and that of the petitioner as Rs.
3,16,516. This form was filed by the petitioner before she sat for the
personality test.
13.5.      It is only when respondent no.1 inquired generally, vis-a-vis all
candidates who had sought benefit under the EWS category, that it
discovered the petitioner‟s family income, as indicated above, which
included her income and that of her father, was beyond the family
income eligibility criteria provided in the OM dated 31.01.2019.
13.6.      It appears that the petitioner‟s father, to get over this difficulty,
on 21.09.2020, filed a revised ITR for F.Y. 2017-18 (A.Y. 2018-19)
scaling down his income from Rs.3,81,972 to Rs.1,04,863. A perusal of
the documents filed for the previous two years [i.e., AYs 2016-17 and
2017-18] shows that there was a steady increase in the petitioner‟s
father‟s income. As indicated above, in A.Y. 2016-17, he had earned an
income of Rs. 2,76,480, while in A.Y. 2017-18 he had disclosed an
income of Rs. 2,83,990. In consonance with this trend, initially, for A.Y.
2018-19, the petitioner‟s father had disclosed his income of Rs.3,81,972.
13.7       The revised ITR for A.Y. 2018-19 showed the petitioner's
father's income as Rs.1,04,863; trimming the total income for A.Y.
2018-19 by nearly 73%. The scaling down was done on 21.09.2020, just
before the petitioner submitted the I&A certificate for F.Y. 2017-18
Digitally Signed By:PREM W.P.(C)No.6932/2021                                             Pg. 13 of 15
13.8.      Therefore, according to us, even if we were to agree with the
petitioner that the delay in filing the correct I&A certificate should not be
the reason for cancelling her candidature, certainly there is a perceptible
and a real doubt as to the petitioner fulfilling the family income
eligibility criteria prescribed in the aforementioned OM.
14.        We may also indicate here that we are not persuaded with the
arguments advanced on behalf of the petitioner that respondent no.1 was
to go by the certificate issued by the concerned Tehsildar and that the
inputs given by the CBDT could not be considered for ascertaining as to
whether or not the petitioner fulfilled the income criteria.
14.1.      Respondent no.1, in our view, is entitled to seek information
from credible sources before concluding, as to whether or not the
concerned candidate has correctly claimed reservation under the EWS
category.
14.2.      In this case, information was sought from the CBDT by the
cadre controlling authority. We do not find anything wrong in the
approach adopted by respondent no.1; CBDT was, without doubt, a
reliable source. Furthermore, even if there was no rule which backed the
action of respondent no.1 in gathering such information, we would
sustain it, looking at the source of the information and the duty cast on
respondent no.1 to satisfy itself that the concerned candidate met the
family income eligibility criteria stipulated for EWS category. It would
fall within respondent no1's implied power. However, in this regard.
Respondent no.1 has adverted to Rule 20 of the CSE Rules 2019, in
paragraph 24 of the reply. For the sake of convenience, the same is
extracted hereafter:
Digitally Signed By:PREM W.P.(C)No.6932/2021                                            Pg. 14 of 15
"20. Success in the examination confers no right to appointment
unless Government is satisfied after such enquiry as may be
considered necessary that the candidate, having regard to his
character and antecedents and certificates produced by him during
the course of examination for the purpose of eligibility as well as
claiming any kind of benefit for reservation is suitable in all
respects for appointment to the Service. The decision of the
Government in this regard shall be final".
14.3.      A careful perusal of the aforesaid rule shows that respondent
no.1, in any event, is tasked with the duty to, inter alia, satisfy itself
whether the claim made for according, the benefit of reservation is
tenable; which, in our opinion, invests in respondent no.1 the
concomitant power to gather the necessary information.
15.        Thus, for the foregoing reasons, we are not inclined to grant
any relief to the petitioner. The writ petition is, accordingly, dismissed.
15.1       Consequently, the pending application shall also stand closed.
16.        There shall be, however, no order as to costs.
