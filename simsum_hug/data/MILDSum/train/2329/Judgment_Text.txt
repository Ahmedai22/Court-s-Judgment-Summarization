              Mrs. Rachana Joshi Issar, AOR
                 UPON hearing the counsel the Court made the following
            At  the request  of  Ms.  Aishwarya  Bhati, learned  Additional
       Solicitor  General,  list  the   instant interlocutory  applications
       after two weeks.
            I.A. No.5075/2021 stands disposed of accordingly.
            Issue notice returnable after two weeks.
            Reply affidavit, if any, be filed by the respondents in the
       meantime.
            Mr. P.S. Narasimha, learned Senior Counsel appearing for the
       applicant - Association, states that there are many shops which
       have been purchased by the owners for commercial use, but these
       have been sealed by the Monitoring Committee on the ground that
       there is an unauthorised and illegal diversion of the user of the
       shops. The allegation of unauthorised use is that the premises
       which have been sealed, were originally purchased as residential
       units and have now been unauthorisedly converted to commercial use.
            It is pointed out by Mr. Narasimha, learned Senior Counsel, on
       the bases of Certificate of Sale [Lease Hold Properties) issued
       under   Rule  90(15)   [Annexure   -   4  at   page  30  of  the  instant
       application) that the premises were original purchased as a shop.
       Further the notice for the auction held on 20.11.1957, shows that
       14 shops in Defence Colony were meant to be auctioned.
            If it is a fact that      the premises which have been sealed on
       the  ground  of   unauthorised   change   of  user  from  residential  to
       commercial, was actually sold as a shop, we see no reason why the
       sealing should continue.
            However, it is important to ascertain which of the premises
       which have been sealed were originally purchased as shops meant for
       commercial use. We accordingly consider it appropriate to direct
       that a list be prepared of all such premises which were originally
       purchased as shops and have now been sealed on the ground that
       residential    premises   have    been    converted   unauthorisedly   to
       commercial premises.
              Mr. A.D.N. Rao, learned Amicus Curiae, will scrutinize all
       the  relevant   documents   regarding    the  original  purchase  of  the
       premises.
            Mr. Sanjiv Sen, learned Senior Counsel appearing for the South
       Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC), seeks permission to point out
       such documents which will show the true status of the shops in
       question when they were purchased.
            We permit the South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) to do
            Since the matter affects the livelihood of the members of the
       applicant-Association, Mr. Rao, learned Amicus Curiae may submit
       his report to this Court within a period of four weeks from today.
            List  the  instant interlocutory  application  along  with the
       above report and I.A. Nos.108457/2020, 96784/2020, 96785/2020 and
       78530/2020 in Writ Petition (C) No.4677/1985 after four weeks.
