Learned Senior Counsel appearing for petitioner submitted that
petitioner was appointed on the post of Sub-Inspector in Civil Police
Department on 17.09.1990. While petitioner was posted at Jaunpur, an
F.I.R. has been lodged by one Chhedi Lal against three persons namely
Jagarnath Chaudhary, Asha Devi and mother of Asha Devi namely
Babana Devi, which was registered as Case Crime No. 172 of 1999
u/s 302, 201, 506 IPC at Police Station Jaunpur, District Jaunpur on
05.06.1999, in which petitioner was not named. Ultimately, charge
sheet was submitted in the year 1999, in which petitioner was also
charge sheeted under section 217, 218, 201 & 120-B IPC whereas
against other accused, charge sheet has been submitted under
sections 302, 201, 506, 217, 218 IPC. Feeling aggrieved by the said
charge sheet, petitioner has filed Criminal Misc. Application No.
6323/2003 (U/s 482 Cr.P.C.), in which this Court vide order dated
10.09.2003 was pleased to stay the further proceedings, which
continued upto year 2020.
It is further submitted that during the pendency of the said
criminal proceeding, petitioner was given out of turn promotion on
14.09.2006 on the post of Inspector, till then he is performing his
duty to the full satisfaction of the authorities and no other
disciplinary or criminal proceeding has ever been initiated against
him. It is next submitted that meeting of Departmental Promotion
Committee (in short, ‘DPC’) was held on 01.01.2018 for promotion
on the post of Deputy Superintendent of Police, in which case of
petitioner was also considered, but due to pendency of criminal
proceeding, his name was kept in a sealed cover envelop and juniors
to petitioner were granted promotion. Thereafter, meeting of DPC
was also held in the years 2020 & 2021 and other juniors to
petitioner have also been promoted.
It is next submitted that when the name of petitioner was kept
in a sealed cover envelop, petitioner has filed Writ Petition No. 7758
of 2019, which was disposed of by this Court vide order dated
07.02.2020 directing respondent No. 1 to decide the representation
of petitioner. Thereafter, comments were called from the Additional
Director General of Police, Administration (hereinafter referred to as
“ADGP,       Administration”)    and   vide    communication     dated
20.08.2020, comments were sent to Secretary Home (Police
Services), Secretariat U.P., Lucknow and in the comments, it is
mentioned that since last ten years, petitioner was awarded excellent
entries and never been penalized either major or minor penalty. It
was also stated in the comments that character role of petitioner is
excellent and after promotion on the post of Inspector, upto 17 years,
petitioner has never misused his post, but without considering the
comments, impugned order has been passed rejecting the claim of
petitioner on two grounds; first of all, petitioner has helped the
accused and secondly, offence against the petitioner is serious in
nature. It is also stated in the impugned order that petitioner was
chargesheeted in Case Crime No. 172 of 1999, under Sections 217,
He firmly submitted that comments so given by ADGP,
Administration had not been considered while passing the impugned
order. He further submitted that trial of main accused has been
concluded and ultimately, they have been convicted vide order dated
02.09.2014 passed by Additional Session Judge, Court No. 2,
Jaunpur under section 304 IPC, which itself shows that petitioner is
not guilty for any charges coupled with this fact that petitioner has
excellent service record and also he has been promoted on the post
of Inspector during the pendency of criminal proceeding. He further
placed reliance upon the Government Order No. 13/21/89-Ka-1-
1997, dated 28.05.1997 and submitted that para-10 is having specific
provision that after considering the promotion of first time charged
employee and keeping his name in a sealed cover envelop, after
completion of one year, the same shall be considered for ad hoc
promotion. Again in Government Order No. 1/2018-13(6)/2017/Ka-1-
2018, dated 09.01.2018, it is stated that in case of pendency of
criminal case in different courts, cases has to be examined for
further proceeding subject to final decision of the cases pending
before the Court. After examination, if it is found proper, further
proceeding should have been ensured. In support of his contention,
he has placed reliance upon the judgment of this Court passed in
Neeraj Kumar Pandey vs. The State of U.P. and 5 others ( Writ-A
No. 8151 of 2022) and submitted that on the similar set of facts
where the name of petitioner was kept in a sealed cover envelop,
Court after considering the Government Orders dated 28.5.1997 &
9.1.2018 directed to open the same to grant promotion. Therefore,
under such facts of the case, Court may please to quash the
impugned order and issue necessary direction for promotion of
Learned standing counsel, on the basis of counter affidavit,
has vehemently opposed the submissions made by learned counsel
for petitioner, but could not dispute the factual as well as legal
submissions made by learned Senior Counsel appearing on behalf of
I have considered rival submissions advanced by learned
counsels for parties and perused the records.
Facts of the case are undisputed. Petitioner was appointed on
the post of Sub-Inspector in Civil Police Department in the year1990
and chargesheet was submitted against him in the year 1999.
Thereafter, he was promoted on the post of Inspector in the year
2006 and first DPC for promotion on the post of Deputy
Superintendent of Police was also held on 01.01.2018, in which
name of petitioner was considered, but due to pendency of criminal
proceeding, his name was kept in a sealed cover envelop and juniors
to him have been granted promotion. Further, as per comments of
ADGP, Administration dated 20.08.2020, several excellent entries
were given to the petitioner in last ten years of his service coupled
with this fact that no punishment, either minor or major was
awarded to the petitioner and after promotion, he has never misused
his post in any way.
I have also perused the judgment of this Court passed in
Neeraj Kumar Pandey (Supra). In the said judgment, after DPC,
name of petitioner was kept in sealed cover envelop denying the
promotion. Court has considered this fact that even after pendency
of criminal proceeding, petitioner has continued in service, directed
the State to open the envelop to grant promotion. While allowing the
petition, Court has also considered the Government Orders dated
So far as case of petitioner is concerned, it is on better footing
than the case of Neeraj Kumar Pandey (Supra). Undisputedly, even
after initiation of criminal proceeding, petitioner was granted
promotion on the post of Inspector on 14.09.2006 upon which he is
still working without any misuse of post. Further, petitioner was
granted excellent entries for last 10 years as mentioned in the
comments of ADGP, Administration dated 20.08.2020. Not only
this, even the criminal proceeding so initiated against the petitioner
along with other co-accused, trial of co-accused was completed and
Additional Session Judge vide order dated 2.9.2014 awarded the
punishment under Section 304 IPC for seven years only, which also
shows that petitioner was not at fault in the said criminal proceeding
so initiated against him. Relevant paragraphs of judgment passed in
Neeraj Kumar Pandey (Supra) is quoted below:-
“17. Having heard the learned counsel for petitioner, the
learned standing counsel for State-respondents and upon
perusal of record, the Court finds that it is an undisputed fact
that irrespective of pendency of criminal case, petitioner has
been allowed to continue. Therefore, mere pendency of a
criminal case, prima-facie, cannot be taken as a ground to
deny promotion of petitioner. The Competent Authority
cannot withhold the claim of petitioner indefinitely on the
ground of having adopted Sealed Cover Procedure, due to
the pendency of criminal case.
18. In view of the discussion made above this writ petition is
disposed of finally with a direction to the Competent
Authority to consider the claim of petitioner for opening the
Sealed Cover within a period of two months from the date
of production of a certified copy of this order in the light of
observations made herein-above.”
After considering the entire facts of the case as well as law
laid down by this Court in Neeraj Kumar Pandey (Supra), this Court
is of the firm view that mere pendency of a criminal case coupled
with this fact that petitioner has been permitted to continue in
service and also granted promotion, cannot be a ground for denying
promotion. Further, additional fact may be taken into consideration
i.e. subsequent service record of petitioner while opening the sealed
cover envelop and in case subsequent service record of petitioner is
found excellent, unblemished, without any punishment, the same
should have been an additional ground to grant him promotion.
Therefore, under such facts and circumstances, impugned
order dated 12.8.2021 passed by respondent No. 1 is contrary to the
provisions of Government Orders dated 28.05.1997 & 09.01.2018 as
well as law laid down by this Court in the matter of Neeraj Kumar
Pandey (Supra), which is not sustainable and hereby set aside.
Accordingly, the writ petition is allowed. No order as to costs.
Respondent No. 1 is directed to take necessary action to open
the sealed cover envelop and grant promotion to the petitioner
maximum within six weeks from the date of production of certified
copy of this order with all consequential benefits.
