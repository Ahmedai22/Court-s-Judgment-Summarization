1.     The instant contempt petition has been filed for the alleged non-
compliance of the order dated 22.07.2019 passed by this Court in W.P. (C)
2.     The genesis of the dispute arises out of the directions passed by the
Apex Court in W.P. (C) 527/2011 in Order dated 29.01.2016. The said writ
petition was filed by the Trained Nurses Association of India (TNAI)
highlighting the grievances of the working conditions of the nurses in
Digitally Signed        CONT.CAS(C) 116/2021                                              Page 1 of 17
private hospitals as well as in nursing homes. The Apex Court by the said
order dated 29.01.2016 passed the following directions:
“4. We expect that the Central Government will look into the
grievances ventilated in this petition, by forming a Committee
within four months from today. We are sure that after
examining the factual situation, if the Committee is of the view
that the grievances ventilated in the petition are correct, the
Committee will make its recommendations, so as to do the
needful for improvement of working conditions and pay of the
nurses working in private hospitals and nursing homes within
six months from its constitution, which can ultimately be given a
form of legislation by the respondent-States or by the Central
Government itself.
5.     We are sure that the recommendations of the Committee
shall be duly considered by the Central Government and it shall
do the needful.
6.     We do not propose to give any guidelines, as prayed for
in this petition, as the grievances are to be looked into by the
Committee consisting of experts.
7.     So far as the grievance, with regard to system of
execution of bonds by private hospitals and nursing homes, is
concerned, the learned counsel appearing on behalf of Indian
Nursing Council has submitted that the said system has not
been abolished. Therefore, the said grievance does not
survive.”
3.     Apropos the said Order dated 29.01.2016 passed by the Apex Court, a
Committee consisting of 9 members, including Directorate General of
Health Service, Joint Secretary, MoHFW amongst others, was constituted by
the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India vide Order
dated 24.02.2016 to look into the grievances raised by TNAI. The said
Expert Committee made the following recommendations:

“Committee examined all the information collected from
various States, All India Govt Nurses Federation (AIGNF) and
Trained Nurses Association of India (TNAI) and felt that
adequate salary and basic facilities are not provided to nurses
employed in private hospitals/nursing homes. Their pay and
working condition is really pathetic and some steps are
required to be taken to uplift the standard of working conditions
in respect of nurses. After deliberations and discussions, the
committee has made following recommendations:
       In case of >200 bedded hospitals, salary given to private
nurses should be at par with the salary of State Govt. nurses
given in the concerned State/UT for the similar corresponding
grade.
       In case of >100 bedded hospitals, salary given to private
nurses should not be more than 10% less in comparison of the
salary of State Govt. nurses given in the concerned State/UT for
the similar corresponding grade.
       In case of 50-100 bedded hospitals, salary given to
private nurses should not be more than 25% less in comparison
of the salary of State Govt. nurses given in the concerned
State/UT for the similar corresponding grade.
       Salary given to private nurses should not be less than
Rs.20000/- pm in any case even for <50 bedded hospitals.
2.      Working conditions:
       Working conditions viz. leaves, working hours, medical
facilities, transportation, accommodation etc. given to nurses
should be at par with the benefits granted to State Govt. nurses
working in the concerned State/UTs.
3.      Steps should be taken by all States/UTs for formulating
legislation/guidelines to be adopted for implementation of the
above recommendations in case of Nurses working in private
hospitals / institutions.”

4.     The recommendations of the Expert Committee constituted by
MoHFW, GoI, were accepted by the Government of NCT of Delhi and an
Order was passed by the Directorate General of Health Service (DGHS) on
25.06.2018 directing all hospitals/nursing homes to comply with the
recommendations of the Expert Committee. The said Order also stated that
failure in compliance of the Apex Court’s Order would be viewed seriously
and strict action, including cancellation of registration in respect of defaulter
private hospital/nursing homes, would be initiated.
5.     The Order dated 25.06.2018 passed by the Directorate General of
Health Service (DGHS) was challenged before this Court by filing W.P. (C)
7291/2018 by private hospitals and nursing homes.
6.     During the pendency of the said writ petition, the Petitioner filed a
writ petition bearing W.P.(C) 5103/2017 before this Court by contending
that the recommendations of the Expert Committee which was constituted in
compliance of the Order dated 29.01.2016 passed by the Apex Court in W.P.
(C) 527/2011 were not being implemented. The Division Bench of this
Court, after noticing that in compliance of the Order dated 29.01.2016
passed by the Apex Court in W.P. (C) 527/2011, an Expert Committee was
formed which had given its recommendations and the same had been
accepted by the Government of NCT of Delhi vide Order dated 25.06.2018,
passed the Order dated 22.07.2019 directing that the recommendations be
implemented. Non-compliance of the order has been alleged in the instant
contempt petition.
7.     The challenge to the Order dated 25.06.2018, passed by the DGHS, in
W.P. (C) 7291/2018 was rejected by the learned Single Judge of this Court
vide Order dated 24.07.2019. In the said order, the Union of India and the

Government of NCT of Delhi vehemently defended the Order dated
25.06.2018. Paragraph No.17 and 18 of the said order which records the
stand of the Government reads as under:
“17. Mr. Sanjoy Ghose submitted, by way of response, that the
impugned Order, dated 25th June, 2018, had nothing to do with
the Minimum Wages Act, or the fixation of minimum wage
thereunder. Apropos the objection, of learned Senior Counsel
appearing for the petitioners, that the private hospitals had not
been heard, before the impugned Order came to be issued, Mr.
Ghose drew my attention to the Order, dated 24th February,
2016 supra, constituting the Expert Committee, which
specifically included two members from private hospitals,
namely Fortis, New Delhi and Narayana Health, Bangalore.
Mr. Ghosh submitted, however, that he was not averse to grant
of a post-decisional hearing to the members of the petitioner-
Association. In fine, Mr. Ghosh submitted that no ground,
whatsoever, existed, for this Court to interfere with the
impugned Notification.
18. Additional1y, the counter affiadavit filed by the GNCTD
draws attention to the fact that, consequent to the
recommendations of the             Expert Committee, e-mail
communications were sent to private hospitals and nursing
homes, seeking their comments/opinion thereon and that, in
response thereto, replies had been received from certain
hospitals. It is also pointed out that the Minimum Wages Act
only sets out the minimum amount payable to employees
covered thereunder, and did not prohibit fixation of wages at a
level higher than the minimum wage.”
8.     The learned Single Judge of this Court vide Order dated 24.07.2019
rejected the challenge to the order dated 25.06.2018 and observed as under:
“34. Having examined the matter in all its aspects and
contours, this Court is convinced that the Expert Committee
cannot be faulted, in any manner, for not having proceeded in
Digitally Signed        CONT.CAS(C) 116/2021                                              Page 5 of 17
accordance with the Minimum Wages Act, or the provisions
thereof. Inasmuch as the Supreme Court has already found that
nurses, in private hospitals and nursing homes, were not being
treated fairly in the matter of their service conditions and pay,
the recommendations of the Expert Committee, constituted by
the Supreme Court in order to examine the issue, have
necessarily to be treated as binding in nature. This Court
therefore, sees no infirmity, whatsoever, in the impugned Order
dated 25th June, 2018, whereby the DGHS, GNCTD has
mandated compliance with recommendations of the Expert
35. Compliance with the impugned Order, based as it is on
the recommendations of the Expert Committee constituted by
the Supreme Court to remedy the pay and service conditions of
nurses employed in private hospitals / nursing homes, cannot be
avoided on the ground of financial hardship. Empirically,
therefore, this Court finds itself unable to subscribe to this
contention, of the petitioner, either. Not one iota of material has
been produced, to bear out the contention that compliance, with
the recommendation of the Expert Committee, would render it
unviable for hospitals to continue functioning.
36. Besides, a reading of the recommendation of the Expert
Committee discloses that care has been taken, therein, not to
direct uniform enhancement of the salary of nurses for all
categories of hospitals. Depending on the number of beds in the
hospital, the extent, to which enhancement of the salary of
nurses is recommended, has been staggered. For hospitals
having less than 50 beds, the recommendations only require
that nurses, employed by the hospital, should not be paid less
than Rs. 20,000/- per month. In the case of hospitals having
between 50 and 100 beds and between 100 and 200 beds, the
Expert Committee has not recommended absolute parity, in pay,
between nurses employed in such employment and nurses
employed in State Government hospitals, but has only
recommended that the difference should not exceed 25% in the
first case and 10% in the Second case.
Digitally Signed        CONT.CAS(C) 116/2021                                             Page 6 of 17
42. The Committee, which constitutes extremely high-ranking
officials, and also includes representatives of private hospitals,
has positively found that the “pay and working condition” of
nurses employed in private hospitals/nursing homes “is really
pathetic". It is sacrilegious, therefore, to require nurses, who
discharge selfless service night after night, to work in
conditions which are pathetic. No compromise can, therefore,
be made, so far as ensuring optimum working conditions, for
nurses, is concerned. The Expert Committee merely equated the
salary, to be paid to nurses in private hospitals and nursing
homes, with the salary paid to nurses in govemment hospitals. It
cannot be said, by any stretch of imagination, that the
recommendation is expropriatory in nature.
52. In view of the above this writ petition is disposed of in the
(i)    The impugned Ordcr, dated 25th June, 2018,
issued by the DGHS, GNCTD, to the extent it
directs     mandatory     compliance       with    the
recommendations of the Expert Committee, by all
private hospitals/nursing homes, in the matter of
pay and service conditions of nurses, employed by
such hospitals/nursing homes, is upheld, and the
challenge, thereto, by the petitioner is rejected.
(ii) Before proceeding to cancel the registration
of any nursing home/hospital, on the ground of
failure, on the part of such nursing home/hospital,
to comply with the recommendations of the Expert
Committee, the DGHS would grant an opportunity
to the allegedly defaulting nursing home/hospital to
represent against such proposed cancellation of its
registration. The nursing home/hospital would also
be extended an opportunity of personal hearing,
before any such decision is taken. All defences,
against the proposed cancellation of its

registration, would be open to such allegedly
defaulting nursing home/hospital, including the
question of whether such cancellation could be
effected, in view of Section 7 read with proviso to
Section 5 (1) of the DNHR Act (supra). The DGHS
would,       on     the    conclusion    of     such
representation/hearing       by     the     affected
hospital/nursing home, pass a speaking order,
dealing with all the defences raised by the
hospital/nursing      homes    concerned,     before
proceeding to take any such proposed action for
cancellation of the registration of the
hospital/nursing home.
(iii) In order to avoid any confusion, it is
clarified that the limited protection against
cancellation of any defaulting hospital/nursing
home. As provided in (ii) (supra), would not detract
from the enforceability of the recommendations of
the Expert Committee, and the impugned Order,
dated 25th June, 2018, insofar as it mandates
compliance, by all hospitals/nursing homes, with
the said recommendations, would stand upheld in
its entirety.
(iv) The period of three months, provided in the
impugned Order dated 25th June, 2018, for the
hospitals/nursing homes to report compliance with
the recommendations of the Expert Committee,
would stand extended, and would now commence
from the date of pronouncement of this judgment,
i.e. 24th July, 2019.”
9.    The Government of NCT of Delhi, after defending the Order dated
25.06.2018, has now filed an affidavit dated 19.08.2020 in the instant
contempt petition stating that the recommendations of the Expert Committee
are unimplementable. The relevant portion of the said affidavit reads as
Digitally Signed        CONT.CAS(C) 116/2021                                            Page 8 of 17
“5. That it is necessary to appreciate certain crucial facts
which have a vital bearing on the issue at hand;
5.1 It is submitted that the Government of India,
Ministry of Health and Family Welfare on
20.09.2016 had forwarded recommendations of the
Committee constituted by it in compliance of the
judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in
29.01.2016 in WP (C) No.527/2011, to all
States/Union Territories for formulation of
necessary legislation/guidelines to be adopted in
respect    of     nurses    working      in    private
hospitals/nursing homes. Pursuant thereto, a
Committee was constituted by the GNCTD in this
regard. The said Committee in its report dated
10.01.2018 recommended that the minimum wage
payable to nurses should not be less than 20,000/-
per month even by nursing homes having less than
50 beds. A copy of the recommendation of the
Committee dated 10.01.2018 is annexed herewith
and marked as Annexure-B.
5.2 Unfortunately, the then DGHS issued the
order dated 25.06.2018 inadvertently without taking
into consideration the aforesaid report of the
Committee dated 10.01.2018.
5.3 It is necessary to bear in mind that nurses
working in the NCT of Delhi are classified as skilled
workers vide the notification dated 26.07.2011
issued by the Joint Secretary, Labour GNCTD. A
copy of the notification dated 26.07.2011 is annexed
herewith as Annexure-C. Furthermore, at present
the wages of skilled workers in the NCT of Delhi has
been fixed at Rs.19,291/- with effect from 01.04.2021
vide order dated 18.06.2021. A true copy of order
dated 18.06.2021 is annexed herewith as Annexure-
Digitally Signed        CONT.CAS(C) 116/2021                                             Page 9 of 17
5.4 Another crucial fact that the needs to be
noticed is that several nursing homes functioning in
GNCTD provide food and housing to nurses apart
from wages being paid to them.
6.     It is also submitted that the salaries / wages payable to
staff of all categories of nursing homes and hospitals are a
component of the input costs that such establishments incur in
the course of the provision of medical services and these are
passed on and borne by the general public which avails
treatment at such establishments. A manifold increase in the
benchmark figure required to be paid as salaries / wages will
have a ripple effect and will be passed to the general public
thereby increasing cost of provision of such services which will
be borne by public at large.”
10.    Dr. Amit George, learned Counsel appearing for the Petitioner, states
that the Expert Committee, which was constituted by the Ministry of Health
and Family Welfare, Government of India in compliance of the Order dated
29.01.2016 passed by the Apex Court in W.P. (C) 527/2011, had made its
recommendations and the same had been categorically accepted by the
Government of NCT of Delhi by passing an Order dated 25.06.2018. He,
therefore, states that after passing such an Order and then defending the
same, it is now not open to the Government to renege on its own Orders and
state that the said Order cannot be implemented.
11.    Per contra, Mr. Gautam Narayan, learned ASC for GNCTD, submits
that, at this juncture, it is not financially viable for the Government to
compel private hospitals/nursing homes to implement the pay scale as
recommended by the said Expert Committee. He draws attention of this
Digitally Signed        CONT.CAS(C) 116/2021                                            Page 10 of 17
Court to the Report dated 10.01.2018 furnished by the DGHS regarding
implementation of the recommendations made by the Expert Committee
wherein it was noted as under:
“3. The details so collected by the concerned branch in this
directorate revealed that:
i)     Some leading private Hospitals submitted that
salary structure suggested by expert committee
constituted by Hon'ble Court is on much higher side
and shall have repercussion on the cost of treatment
However, they were positive regarding improvement
in working conditions. As per information gathered
from different private hospitals, the salary being
given to nurses was found to be varying from Rs.
14000/- as minimum & Rs 33500/- as maximum.
Some hospitals give other incentives like free
uniform, leave encashment, gratuity concession in
medical treatment, leaves DA/Increment and also
have working hours 48 Hrs in a week. The private
hospitals gave comparison of nursing ratio in
private hospital viz a viz Govt. hospital & stated that
financial impact would be disproportionately higher,
patient cost, FDI momentum will come down with
these recommendations. It was also found that the
nursing staff working in certain hospitals having
critical areas are paid more than in other areas.
ii)    Another large hospital chain in Delhi
submitted that there should be overall development,
improvement in working conditions and they are
aligned with Apex Court’s Judgment and
recommendation, however they were not involved,
no inputs were taken from them by the expert
committee and no specific benchmark for working
conditions have been mentioned. Further, the
recommendations given by committee were not in
line with free market principles and nowhere Govt

has gone beyond setting minimum wage guidelines
and dictated as to how comparative level of job
across limit in private sector should be decided.
4.      Delhi Nursing Council was also requested to give its
opinion to which it has submitted that all nursing homes/
hospital in private should pay adequate salary and basic
facilities. Delhi Nursing Council on its own had attempted to
collect some information from private hospitals and found that
salary being paid by private hospital range from Minimum Rs
10000/- by some hospitals and around Rs 19250/- by some
hospitals.
5.      The committee also looked into the pay being given in
Govt institution. It was found that the nurses who are recruited
through selection process are given Govt scale allowance and
the gross salary is about Rs 62946/- as per prevailing pay
scales Another group of nurses engaged on contactual basis
under Delhi State Health Mission (DSHM) for specific jobs
under the programme get Rs. 27359/- at level I and Rs. 29801/-
in a month at level II with provision of leaves.
6.      The committee also observed that the Nurses working in
private institutions are covered under statutory Labour laws
which was evident from notification dated 26/07/2011 where the
Nursing staff is covered under skilled worker. (Annexure- A)
1.      The committee after having gone through these details
and discussion on the matter unanimously agreed that the
minimum wages as recommended by expert committee, GOI,
seem to be justified and it should not be less than Rs.20,000/-
p.m even by a smaller nursing home having less than 50 beds.
There are private hospitals in Delhi that have different
specialities and have large number of beds, some hospitals with
super-specialities even with lesser than 50 beds, thus they
should consider higher salary to attract good and skilled
nursing staff, which, ultimately would help in better patient
Digitally Signed        CONT.CAS(C) 116/2021                                          Page 12 of 17
care. Therefore, the hospital with more specialized kind of
facilities should consider paying more than the minimum wages
skilled workers.
2.      It was also observed by the committee that the hospitals
with NABH accreditations are being paid more than the non
NABH hospitals by the insurance agencies. Their charges for
the same treatment procedure are also higher than the smaller
hospitals and non NABH hospitals. The committee is of the view
that it is beneficial for the hospitals to attract better talent with
better salary and thus they should implement the
recommendations.
3.      In regard to working conditions the committee was
apprised that there is a provision in Section 5 (b), of DNHR Act
1953 that registration may be refused if a nurse is not resident
in nursing home. Some provisions are already there under
relevant DNHR Rules with regard to the working environment
in nursing home/hospital. Thus the nursing staff need to be
provided suitable accommodation or alternatives even for
registration, therefore, advisories should be issued to private
hospitals to implement the same.
4.      The concerned branch dealing in private nursing homes
and hospitals in this directorate may consider to check various
provisions already there in the relevant act and rules, relevant
provisions under labour laws etc. are met before grant of
registration/renewal of registration. Advisories to this effect
including yearly submission of compliances of Labour Laws
may also be issued and check list if any should be suitable
modified.
5.      Since fixation of minimum wages for skilled worker is the
domain of Labour Deptt, therefore, it may be requested to
consider changes in minimum wages of Nurses in view of
Hon’ble Supreme Court Judgment in WP (C) no 527/2011 and
report of Expert Committee, GOI, MOHFW.
Digitally Signed        CONT.CAS(C) 116/2021                                             Page 13 of 17
12.   Mr. Gautam Narayan, learned ASC for GNCTD, further relies upon
the Minutes of Meeting dated 13.08.2021 under the Chairpersonship of
Minister of Health, GNCTD, and refers to the following paragraphs:
“3. Addl. Chief Secretary (H&FW) informed that the earlier
dated 25.06.2018 was issued by then DGHS at his own level
without seeking approval of Department of Health & Family
Welfare, GNCTD and the competent authority. He pointed out
that any Government Order requires suitable backing of the
existing laws which was not the case in respect of the aforesaid
Order dated 25.06.2018. Further, fixation of wages lies under
the purview of Labour Department and there are no provisions
of fixing of wages of nurses in the existing Delhi Nursing Homes
Registration Act, 1953 and Rules made thereunder.
4.      Addl. Chief Secretary (H&FW) further informed that
Department of Health & Family Welfare, GNCTD had sought
the views of Law Department, GNCTD on the said matter. Law
Department, GNCTD opined that Hon'ble Delhi High Court in
W.P. (C) 7291/2018 had upheld the DGHS order dated
25.06.2018. As regards the issue that the same does not have
the approval of the competent authority, the same may be
obtained ex-post facto. On the contrary, if the administrative
department now intends to put in place any new policy in place
of the earlier one, on any ground or facts or the circumstances,
which have not been considered earlier or placed before the
Hon'ble High Court, the same shall required to be placed
before the Hon'ble High Court. Similarly, the circumstances/
developments emerged in the matter requiring change in stance
of Govt. of NCT of Delhi are required to be apprised to the
Hon'ble High Court in the Contempt Petition. Accordingly, the
appropriate policy decision may first be taken in the matter
before adopting the measures as suggested above that would be
subject of consideration and orders of Hon'ble Court.
5.      Medical Superintendent Nursing Homes informed that
Director, Nursing Section, MoHFW, Gol vide letter dated

20.09.2016 had forwarded the recommendations of the
Committee to all States/UTs for formulating the legislation/
guidelines to be adopted in r/o nurses working in private
hospitals/ institutions. In pursuance to the same, a Committee
was constituted vide Orders dated 04.07.2017 & 11.07.2017.
The said Committee in its report dated 10.01.2018
recommended that the minimum wages should not be less than
Rs.20,000/- per month even by smaller nursing home having
less than 50 beds. Since, fixation of minimum wages for skilled
worker is a domain of Labour Department, hence, it may be
requested to consider changes in minimum waages of Nurses in
view of Hon'ble Supreme Court judgement in W.P. (C) No.
527/2011 and report of the Expert Committee, MoHFW, GoI.
The copy of the report of the Committee is annexed at Annexure
6.     Medical Superintendent Nursing Homes further informed
that Order No. F.23/(413)/GEN/ Circular/DHS/HQ/14/643-645
dated 25.06.2018 was issued by then DGHS inadvertently
without considering the report of the Committee.
7.     Medical Superintendent Nursing Homes pointed out that
nurses in NCT of Delhi are considered under Skilled category
vide Notification No. 12(28)/142/11/MW/Lab 2046 dated
26.07.2011 issued by Jt. Secretary (Labour), GNCTD. The copy
of the notification is annexed at Annexure 'B'. He also informed
that presently the wages of skilled worker in NCT of Delhi
notified vide Order No. 12(142)/02/MW/VII]/Partfile/2044-
2055 dated 18.06.2021 is Rs. 19,291/- per month w.e.f.
01.04.2021. The copy of the said Order is annexed at Annexure
8.     DGHS informed that several nursing homes provide food
and lodging to their nurses apart from their wages and this fact
should also be taken into consideration.

agreed that implementation of Order No. 23/ (413)/GEN/

DGHS without seeking approval of the competent authority is
unworkable and impracticable. It was decided that nurses
working in private hospitals/ nursing homes in NCT of Delhi
are included in the Scheduled employment under Skilled
category of employees vide Notification No. 12(28)/142/11/MW/
Lab 2046 dated 26.07.2011 issued by Jt. Secretary (Labour),
GNCTD. Therefore, the minimum rates of wages in Scheduled
Employments under Minimum Wages Act, 1948 in the National
Capital Territory of Delhi notified by Labour Department,
GNCTD should be applicable upon these nurses working in
private hospitals / nursing homes. It was further decided that
Hon'ble High Court of Delhi may be suitably apprised
regarding the change in stance of Govt. of NCT of Delhi, and
the reasoning for it, as per advice of Law Department.”
13.    Despite the report dated 10.01.2018, pointing out the difficulties to
implement the recommendation of the Committee, the State accepted the
recommendation and order dated 25.06.2018 was passed. Further the
GNCTD chose to defend the Order dated 25.06.2018 before the learned
Single Judge in W.P. (C) 7291/2018. This indubitably reveals that the
GNCTD has willingly given the recommendations of the Expert Committee
of the State a go-by and accepted the recommendations of the Expert
Committee constituted under the orders of the Apex Court. If the GNCTD is
of the opinion that the recommendations of the Expert Committee are not
financially viable, it is for them to approach the Division Bench to seek a
clarification on the same. However, GNCTD has chosen not to adopt that
procedure and has now filed an affidavit dated 19.08.2021 stating that the
recommendations of the Expert Committee are unimplementable.

stance of the GNCTD inasmuch as the GNCTD, after accepting the
recommendations of the Expert Committee and defending the Order of the
DGHS dated 25.06.2018 before the learned Single Judge, is now taking a U-
turn by stating that said Order cannot be implemented. This conduct of the
GNCTD is not appreciated. It further raises the apprehension that something
has transpired during the time that has passed between the rendering of the
learned Single Judge’s Order dated 24.07.2019 and the filing of the affidavit
dated 19.08.2021 that has caused the GNCTD to take a 180° change in its
stand. This can be construed as wilful disobedience of the Orders of this

time to get further instructions in the matter.

22.07.2019 before the next date of hearing. In case the said Order is not
complied with, the concerned Officers are directed to be present in the Court

Contempt of Courts Act, 1971 should not be initiated against the erring
