Dated this the 13th day of June, 2022
“Brood parasitism” is a breeding strategy adopted by
some birds, insects and fishes to raise their young. The most
familiar example is a cuckoo laying eggs in a crow's nest to
raise their young by befooling the crow.        Homosapiens also
seem to have started adopting that strategy to befool their life
2.   Here is a case where a husband, after begetting a
child in his employee, took that child to his wife, a barren lady,
as if that child was abandoned by an unwed Nurse and offered
for adoption. The innocent wife nurtured that child believing
the child to be an adopted one, giving the love and warmth of
a mother. The wicked husband continued his illicit relationship
Mat.Appeal No.242 of 2012 & conn. cases 6
with the employee and often took the child to its biological
mother to be in company with her. After about five years, the
wife realised that, her husband was the biological father of
that child and the child was born in his illicit relationship with
the employee.             Realising the height of cheating she was
subjected to, she returned to her paternal home. When her
brothers intervened, he admitted paternity of the child but he
was not ready to give up his illicit relationship with the
employee who delivered his child. Thereafter the wife did not
come back to continue her marital relationship with the
husband. Their life boat which was otherwise sailing smoothly
sunk in deep sea due to the infidelity and distrust of her life
partner. The wife was compelled to break the nuptial tie as her
dreams and aspirations regarding the sanctity of marriage
were shattered due to the illicit connection, which her husband
had with his employee. Bringing the child born out of his illicit
relationship, to be taken care of by his wife as if it was an
adopted child, added insult upon injury.
3.      The couple lived together for about 16½ years
smoothly, doing various business activities and acquiring lot of
properties in their name jointly and severally. The wife left the
Mat.Appeal No.242 of 2012 & conn. cases   7
husband       on 07.03.2006 knowing about the cheating played
upon her by the husband. As the husband was not ready to
give up his illicit connection with the employee, she filed
Divorce O.P before the Family Court, Thrissur on 23.03.2006.
Thereafter, the husband filed O.P No.559 of 2006 against the
wife for a declaration that he was the beneficial owner and the
wife was only a name lender/benamidar in the property
transactions, and claiming injunction against her with respect
to item No.1 to 17 properties. Subsequently, the wife filed O.P
No.775 of 2006 before the very same court, against the
husband, and the minor son born to him in his employee, for a
declaration that              she is the beneficial owner and the
respondents are only name lenders/benamidars in 'F' to 'P'
schedule properties and in the alternative, for a partition, and
injunction - both mandatory and prohibitory, with respect to 'A'
to 'E' schedule properties, and also to get back 'Q' schedule
movables or its equivalent value.
4.     The Family Court tried those three cases together
treating O.P No.366 of 2006, the O.P for divorce filed by the
wife, as the leading case.              PWs 1 to 7 were examined and
Exts.A1 to A72 were marked from the side of the wife. RWs 1
Mat.Appeal No.242 of 2012 & conn. cases     8
to 69 were examined and Exts.B1 to B237 were marked from
the side of the husband.                Exts.X1 to X324 were marked as
witness exhibits and Ext.C1 and C1(a) were marked as Court
5. The Family Court, Thrissur, after evaluating the facts,
evidence and circumstances, allowed O.P No.366 of 2006
dissolving their marriage, dismissed O.P No.559 of 2006, and
decreed in part O.P No.775 of 2006 as per common judgment
6.    Challenging the decree of divorce in O.P No.366 of
2006, the husband filed Mat.Appeal No.244 of 2012. Against
dismissal of O.P No.559 of 2006, the husband filed Mat.Appeal
No.243 of 2012.            Against the relief granted to the wife vide
decree in O.P No.775 of 2006, the husband filed Mat.Appeal
No.242 of 2012.              Against the relief which was declined in
O.P No.775 of 2006, the wife filed Mat.Appeal No.317 of 2012.
7. Divorce was granted in O.P No.366 of 2006, on the
ground of adultery committed by the husband with the
2nd respondent in that O.P., who was an employee in his shop.
Though the husband preferred Mat.Appeal No.244 of 2012
against that judgment and decree, subsequently he not
Mat.Appeal No.242 of 2012 & conn. cases 9
pressed that appeal, and hence it was dismissed as not
pressed by which the decree of divorce on the ground of
adultery stands confirmed.
8.      The brief facts necessary for the appeals under
consideration could be summarised as follows:
Sri.C.C Joy married Smt.C.D Mini on 10.09.1989. At that
time, he was running a home appliances shop. After marriage,
a telephone booth and a beauty parlour were started in a
portion of that shop and Smt. Mini was its licensee. As they
could not bear a child even after continued treatment,
Smt.Mini agreed for adopting a child, and they went to an
institution and got registered there. Later Sri.Joy told Smt.Mini
that an unwed Nurse delivered a child, and as she is going
abroad, the child is offered for adoption.   Smt.Mini went along
with Sri.Joy to meet the child in the house of his sister at
Muringoor.        On the 9th month, the child was taken to their
house, and baptised, naming him 'Milan'.       Smt.Mini nurtured
and brought up that child as her own child, believing that the
child was adopted by them. Later she realised that Sri.Joy was
playing fraud upon her, and the child was born in his illicit
Mat.Appeal No.242 of 2012 & conn. cases 10
connection with his employee named Smt.Kala.                Unable to
bear the height of cheating, she went back to her paternal
house. Though her brothers and relatives intervened, Sri.Joy
was not ready to give up his illicit connection with Smt.Kala,
which resulted in wreckage of her family life.
9. Sri.Joy is admitting that, now his son Milan, and his
mother Smt.Kala, who was once his employee, are residing in
the house constructed by him at Ernakulam, and he often
visits the school, and signs the school diary, as his father. He
is admitting that he is having joint Bank accounts with
Smt.Kala, and obviously, now Sri.Joy and Smt.Kala are
residing together at his house at Ernakulam along with their
son Milan. Though he had a contention that he had physical
relationship with Smt.Kala with the knowledge and blessings of
Smt.Mini, that is not a believable story as Smt.Mini went back
to her paternal house, immediately on knowing that Sri.Joy
was the biological father of that child.       By not pressing the
Mat.Appeal No.244 of 2012 against the decree of divorce
granted on the ground of adultery, now Sri.Joy is endorsing
paternity of the child born out of his adulterous life with Smt.Kala.
Mat.Appeal No.242 of 2012 & conn. cases 11
10.        During subsistence of their marriage, several
properties were acquired by them jointly and severally and
after their separation, Sri.Joy filed O.P No.559 of 2006 for
declaration with respect to item No.1 to 17 properties as his
own and Smt.Mini filed O.P No.775 of 2006 claiming absolute
right with respect to 'A' to 'P' schedule immovable properties
and 'Q' schedule movables.
11. Regarding 'F' to 'N' schedule properties standing in
the joint name, Smt.Mini has sought for an alternative relief of
partition also, to allot her separate share.
12. Sri.Joy says that, the whole properties scheduled in
both cases exclusively belong to him, he expended money to
purchase those properties, he is possessing and improving the
same, and the title documents of those properties are still with
him. According to him, he purchased those properties for his
own benefit and not for the benefit of his wife. So, according
to him, even if some properties stand in the name of Smt.Mini
also, she has no right, title or interest over any of those
properties, and she was only a name lender in the respective
Mat.Appeal No.242 of 2012 & conn. cases    12
13. The case of Smt.Mini also is that, she is the absolute
owner of the whole properties scheduled, and Sri.Joy was only
a name lender in the documents.                   He had no business or
income and the source of money for purchasing those
properties was the income derived from her telephone booth,
beauty parlour and share business.                  She purchased those
properties for her own benefit, and not for the benefit of
Sri.Joy. So, their contention is that the properties were
purchased in 'benami' in the name of their spouse, and since
the spouse being only a name lender and trustee, he/she will
not get any right, title or interest over those properties.
14. Sri.Joy admitted that he started his business with a
watch repairing shop and                at the time of marriage, he was
running a home appliances shop.                According to him, he had
various businesses by the names See See's Time House,
real estate business, share market business, old car business
etc. etc. But he admitted that, he had not renewed his sales
tax registration after 1991. He has not adduced any specific
evidence to prove his income from his various businesses
except      the     Bank       Pass     Books   showing  some   financial
Mat.Appeal No.242 of 2012 & conn. cases 13
transactions and some income tax returns. Though Smt.Mini
filed a petition calling upon him to produce the details of his
businesses and income derived therefrom, he could not
produce any such documents.
15.       During cross examination in page 68, Sri.Joy
deposed that his income was too high than shown in the
income tax returns and the income shown in the returns was
not correct.         In the argument notes titled “the business of
Sri.Joy and benefit of purchase”, in paragraph 19, it is stated
that all the real estate transactions of Sri.Joy are not brought
on record, to maintain his business secrecy, and also due to
fear that Smt.Mini might create impediments for sale of some
of the properties that are not on record.       In paragraph 27, he
would admit that he had purchased properties in the name of
Smt.Mini, which she was not even aware of, as part of his real
estate business.
16.      The case of Smt.Mini is that Sri.Joy had lost his
home appliance business, and after marriage, in a portion of
that shop, a beauty parlour and a telephone booth were
started by her and she was getting income therefrom, and
with that income, she purchased the properties.           But, PW1
Mat.Appeal No.242 of 2012 & conn. cases      14
Smt.Mini       herself      admitted       in   page  No.4  of  her cross
examination         that,     she      was    getting monthly  income  of
Rs.10,000/- from the beauty parlour and Rs.1,500 from the
telephone booth. It is difficult to believe that she could
purchase commercial plots in Thrissur town and Ernakulam
City with the income she was deriving from the beauty parlour
and the telephone booth. According to Smt.Mini, Sri.Joy was
transferring money belonging to various persons into his Bank
account for some period, and thereafter it was returned to
them. So, according to her, the entries in his Bank pass book
were     fake, and it will not prove his source of income to
purchase the properties.
17. At this juncture, Sri.G.S. Reghunath, learned counsel
appearing for Smt.Mini brought to our notice Annexure A,
certified copy of the judgment in Calendar Case No.5/2008 in
the Court of Special Judge (SPE/CBI)-I Ernakulam, which was
accepted, as per order in I.A No.1 of 2022 in Mat. Appeal
No.317 of 2012. In that case, Sri.Joy was the 12 th accused,
and    he     was       charged         under   Section  120B  read  with
Sections 13(1)(d), 13(2) of PC Act, and Sections 420, 468 and
471 of IPC. The allegation against him was that, Sri.Joy, who
Mat.Appeal No.242 of 2012 & conn. cases     15
was a real estate broker, hatched a criminal conspiracy with
A1, Bank Manager of Union Bank of India, Cherpu branch, A13
Sri.K.T Thomas, a Chartered Accountant,and A14 Sri.G. Jyothi,
a Tax Practitioner, and entered into an illegal agreement to
canvass persons for loans, irrespective of their ineligibility and
capacity to repay the same, and collected part of the loan
sanctioned amount as commission, and canvassed A2 to A11
somewhere in 2004, and A1 Bank Manager processed and
sanctioned housing loans to them, without making proper
pre-sanction verifications, and accepting forged income tax
returns, and without ensuring the end use of funds.             Sri.Joy
was found guilty and convicted along with the other accused,
and he was sentenced to undergo simple imprisonment for two
years     each       and     fine,      under  Section 120B read   with
Sections 420, 468 and 471 of IPC with a default sentence,
directing that the substantive sentences shall run concurrently.
18. Sri.Joy also is admitting that, he was arranging loans
on commission basis. Annexure A judgment will show that, he
was canvassing people for availing bank loans as part of a
criminal conspiracy and he might have received huge amounts
as commission. 'D' to 'P' schedule properties in O.P No.775 of
Mat.Appeal No.242 of 2012 & conn. cases 16
2006 were seen purchased in the year 2004 and 2005.             The
alleged criminal conspiracy and illegal transactions were
carried out by Sri.Joy somewhere in 2004 as seen from
Annexure A judgment. His bank passbooks might have been
showing the amounts which he might have received in that
manner, as no scrap of paper has been produced to prove his
business and income therefrom, to think otherwise. But we are
not supposed to go into the legality of the transactions done
by Sri.Joy, or the benefit he had derived therefrom. There is
Vigilance and Income Tax Department to look into those
19. Now the question mooted before us is that, whether
the transactions involved in the above O.Ps are benami
transactions or not, and if it is benami, who is the real owner?
20.      Before        proceeding    further, let us have  an
understanding of what is meant by the word 'benami', the
transactions treated as 'benami', and the basic ingredients
which determines a 'benami' transaction.
21.      The word 'benami' is a Persian compound word
made up of two different words namely, 'be' which means
Mat.Appeal No.242 of 2012 & conn. cases  17
'without' and 'nam' which denotes 'name'.              It, therefore,
literally means, 'without a name', that is nameless or fictitious,
and is used to denote a transaction which is really done by a
person without using his own name but in the name of
another.       Benami transfer or transaction means the transfer
by or to a person who acts only as an ostensible owner in
place of the real owner, whose name is not disclosed. The
question whether such transfer or transaction was real or
benami depends upon the intention of the beneficiary.            The
real owner in such cases may be called the beneficiary and the
ostensible      owner       the     benamidar (Hindu Code  by  Gour,
4th edition, Page 726).
22. The benamidar has no beneficial interest in the
property or business that stands in his name; he represents in
fact the real owner and so far as the relative legal position is
concerned, he is a mere trustee for him. The Hon'ble Supreme
Court in Java Dayal Peddar vs. Bibi Hazra (AIR 1974
Supreme Court 171) laid down the following tests to determine
whether a transaction is benami or not.
i) The source from which the purchase money came.
Mat.Appeal No.242 of 2012 & conn. cases       18
ii) The nature and possession of the property after the
purchase.
iii) Motive, if any, for giving the transaction a benami
colour.
iv) The position of the parties and the relationship, if any,
between the claimant and the alleged benamidar.
v) The custody of the title-deeds after the sale, and
vi) The conduct of the parties concerned in dealing with the
property after the sale.
23.        The Apex Court re-affirmed the six tests to
determine the nature of a transaction as benami or not, in a
subsequent decision Valliammal vs. Subramanian (AIR 2004
24.       Section 3(1) and (2) of the Benami Transactions
(Prohibition) Act, 1988 (before its amendment in the year
“3. Prohibition of benami transactions.—
(1)     No     person       shall    enter into any benami
(2)     Nothing in sub-section (1) shall apply to—
(a) the purchase of property by any person in
the name of his wife or unmarried daughter and
Mat.Appeal No.242 of 2012 & conn. cases  19
it shall be presumed, unless the contrary is
proved, that the said property had been
purchased for the benefit of the wife or the
unmarried daughter...”.
25. The amendment Act 43 of 2016 came into effect on
01.11.2016 renaming the Act as 'The Prohibition of Benami
Property Transactions Act, 1988 (45 of 1988).           In Binapani
Paul     vs.    Prathima           Ghosh  ((2007) 6 SCC   100),  the
Hon'ble Supreme Court held that the Benami Transactions
(Prohibition) Act, 1988 has no retrospective effect. The
transactions disputed in the case on hand were spanning over
the period 1998 to 2005 i.e. when the Benami Transactions
(Prohibition) Act, 1988 was holding the field.
26. Section 2(a) of the Benami Transactions (Prohibition)
Act, 1988 defines a 'benami transaction' as 'any transaction in
which property is transferred to one person for a consideration
paid or provided by another person'.
27.     Going by Section 3(2)(a) of the said Act, nothing
prevents a person from purchasing property in the name of his
wife or unmarried daughter, and unless the contrary is proved,
it is presumed that the said property has been purchased for
Mat.Appeal No.242 of 2012 & conn. cases 20
the benefit of the wife or the unmarried daughter, as the case
may be.
28.      So, in order to find out whether the transaction
alleged is a 'benami transaction' or not, we have to apply the
six tests set out by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Java Dayal
Peddar's case (supra). If it is found that the person in whose
name the property stands was only a name lender, and the
property was actually purchased for the benefit of the
beneficial owner, expending his own money, then of course,
the benamidar may not get any right, title or interest over the
properties held in his/her name.
29. We have to test each and every transaction involved
in O.P Nos.559 of 2006 and 775 of 2006, in the touchstone of
six acid tests set out by the Hon'ble Supreme Court, to find
out whether those transactions were benami or not, and if it
was a benami transaction, who was the benamidar and who
was the beneficiary.
30.       In O.P No.775 of 2006, the wife Smt.Mini has
scheduled 'A' to 'P' schedule immovable properties and 'Q'
schedule movables.              In O.P No.559 of 2006, the husband
Sri.Joy has included 17 items of immovable properties.
Mat.Appeal No.242 of 2012 & conn. cases  21
I.       Item No.17 in O.P No.559 of 2006
31.      Item No.17 in O.P No.559 of 2006 is in the joint
name of Smt.Mini, Sri.Joy and Milan.                 That property is
extending 70 and odd cents in Kadupassery village comprised
in survey No.380/1.               That property was purchased as per
Ext.B18 document.             Though that property stands in the joint
name of Smt.Mini, Sri.Joy and Milan, Smt.Mini has not made
any claim over that property.               She has not scheduled that
property in         O.P No.775 of 2006 filed by her.      According to
Sri.Joy, he is possessing and improving that property.            PW1
Smt.Mini admitted that, she is not in possession of that
property, and she is not taking income therefrom. She has no
case that, she expended any money for purchasing item
No.17, though that property stands in her name also.             Since
Smt.Mini is not making any claim over that property, and she
has not included that property in the schedule of properties in
O.P No.775 of 2006, obviously that property was purchased by
Sri.Joy in the joint name of himself, his wife Smt.Mini and son
Milan, for his own benefit and not for the benefit of Smt.Mini or
Milan. So, regarding item No.17 in O.P No.559 of 2006, he
Mat.Appeal No.242 of 2012 & conn. cases 22
was entitled for the declaration as prayed for and dismissal of
O.P No.559 of 2006 by the Family Court with respect to item
No.17 is liable to be set aside.
II.      'E' (item No.1 to 3 in O.P No.559 of 2006) and
'O' schedule property in O.P No.775 of 2006
32. Item No.1 to 3 in O.P No.559 of 2006, corresponds
to 'E' schedule properties in O.P No.775 of 2006. According to
Sri.Joy, he entered into Ext.B1 sale agreement for purchasing
125.500 cents of land in Thrikkakkara North Village for a
consideration of Rs.60,000/- per cent.     Out of that property,
10 cents was sold to one Mr.K.V Kuriakose as per sale deed
No.3984/1/2005 dated 28.05.2005 which was marked as
Ext.B114. 57 ¾ cents was purchased in the name of Smt.Mini,
his wife, as per Ext.B5 document, and the balance 57¾ cents
was purchased in his own name as per Ext.B19 document.
Though Ext.B1 sale agreement was executed in the name of
Sri.Joy alone, as he wanted to take a bank loan for purchase
of that property, and as there was limit for personal loan upto
Rs.30 lakh, he decided to include his wife Mini also, for the
purpose of availing loan in her name. He could prove payment
of advance from his own account and availing of separate loan
Mat.Appeal No.242 of 2012 & conn. cases  23
for himself and his wife. The Family Court relied upon Ext.A72
agreement to find that, there was separate sale agreement in
favour of Smt.Mini and so, Ext.B1 sale agreement was not
33. Ext.B1 sale agreement is dated 28.02.2005 and
Sri.Joy agreed to purchase 125.500 cents of land within three
months from the date of agreement.               Exts.B5 and B19 sale
deeds were executed on 28.05.2005, exactly three months
from the date of Ext.B1. Ext.A72 sale agreement with respect
to 57¾ cents is dated 20.05.2005 i.e. just eight days prior to
the execution of the sale deed.             RW13, the vendor, deposed
that his father Pareed Haji and others executed Ext.B1 sale
agreement in favour of Sri.Joy, and subsequently, his father
passed away.            So, obviously, in Ext.A72 sale agreement,
Sri.Pareed Haji is not a party.
34.     RW26 Bank Manager supported the case of Sri.Joy
that, the personal loan that could have been sanctioned per
person was only Rs.30 lakh.             The total cash requirement for
the purchase of Exts.B5 and B19 property was more than
Rs.70 lakh including registration fee and value of stamp paper.
So, the maximum personal loan of Rs.30 lakh might not have
Mat.Appeal No.242 of 2012 & conn. cases  24
been sufficient for Sri.Joy to purchase that property. So, his
case that in order to avail maximum loan amount from the
Bank, he decided to split the purchase in his name as well as
in the name of his wife, seems to be a probable one.
35. The advance amount as per Ext.B1 sale agreement
was Rs.5 lakh and Sri.Joy paid that amount by way of cheque
drawn from his X-40 Account in Syndicate Bank, Palace road,
Thrissur. When two separate sale agreements were executed
for the purpose of availing separate loans in the name of
Sri.Joy and Smt.Mini, the advance amount was also split up as
Rs.2.5 lakh, in each agreement. RW69 Jayesh admitted receipt
of cheque for Rs.8,66,400/- drawn from Ext.X-40 Account of
Sri.Joy, for purchasing the stamp paper on 26.05.2005.
RW39, the document writer who wrote Exts.B5 and B19,
deposed that he prepared those documents as instructed by
Sri.Joy. RWs13 and 14, the vendors, RW15 attesting witness
all deposed that, Exts.B5 and B19 properties were purchased
by Sri.Joy, and Smt.Mini was not involved in that transaction.
RW44, the coconut climber, RW54, the immediate neighbour,
and RW55, a surety in their Bank loan, deposed that after
execution       of     Ext.B5      and  B19 documents, Sri.Joy was
Mat.Appeal No.242 of 2012 & conn. cases 25
possessing and improving that land.
36.       57¾ cents of land purchased in the name of
Smt.Mini as per Ext.B5 sale deed is item No.1 to 3 in O.P
No.559 of 2006, and it corresponds to 'E' schedule in
O.P.No.775 of 2006. The balance 57¾ cents purchased in the
name of Sri.Joy as per Ext.B19 document is 'O' schedule
property in O.P.No.775 of 2006. That property is not scheduled
in O.P No.559 of 2006, filed by Sri.Joy, may be because the
document stands in his exclusive name. The 'E' and 'O'
schedule properties in O.P No.775 of 2006 are lying together
as a single plot as reported by RW64 Advocate Commissioner
in Ext.B113 commission report. Smt.Mini is not disputing that
fact. At the same time she admits that Sri.Joy is in possession
of that property.
37. Regarding repayment of loan amount with respect to
'E' and 'O' schedule properties, RW1 Sri.Joy deposed that, he
was remitting amounts to the two loan accounts, by way of
one cheque.            RW26 Bank Manager supported Sri.Joy by
producing the cheque discounting forms X-100 to X-102. The
Bank Manager adduced evidence to show that, the payments
were made from X-103 SB Account of Sri.Joy in Syndicate
Mat.Appeal No.242 of 2012 & conn. cases    26
Bank, M.G road branch.                  The Bank Manager further stated
that, the payments through the cheque discounting forms
were made by Sri.Joy. Smt.Mini has not adduced any evidence
to show that, she paid the loan instalments with respect to 'E'
and 'O' schedule properties.                She has got a case that 'O'
schedule property was also purchased by her, using her own
funds, in the name of her husband and so she is the absolute
owner and Sri.Joy is only a name lender.
38. What is exempted under Section 3(2) of the Benami
Transactions        (Prohibition) Act, 1988        is the  purchase  of
properties by any person in the name of his wife or unmarried
daughter and it shall be presumed, unless the contrary is
proved, that the said property had been purchased for the
benefit of the wife or the unmarried daughter. That exemption
does not include purchase of property by any person in the
name of her husband. So much so, the purchase if any made
by the wife in the name of her husband is not covered under
the saving clause of Section 3(2) of the Benami Transactions
39.       It is quite explicit from the available facts and
evidence       that, in order to arrange separate Bank loans for
Mat.Appeal No.242 of 2012 & conn. cases    27
purchasing 'E' and 'O' schedule properties, in spite of
executing Ext.B1 agreement in the name of Sri.Joy, separate
agreements were executed in the name of Smt.Mini and
40.      As we have seen, there is nothing to show that
Smt.Mini paid the loan instalments to loan A/c Nos.1986 and
1987. She admitted that, she had given Ext.A28 letter to the
Bank not to accept repayment of loan from Sri.Joy. When the
Bank initiated SARFAESI proceedings, Sri.Joy obtained a stay
order regarding 'E' and 'O' schedule properties. But, Smt.Mini
approached the court for a relief with respect to 'E' schedule
property alone, and no relief was sought with respect to 'O'
schedule, though her claim was that 'O' schedule property also
absolutely belongs to her.              Though she obtained an order to
repay the dues amounting to Rs.30 lakh with respect to 'E'
schedule property in six equal monthly instalments, she did
not make any payment as admitted by her.                  PW1 Smt.Mini
admitted during her cross examination that, she addressed the
Bank, not to accept repayment of loan amount from Sri.Joy, as
she knows that, if instalments are defaulted, the property
would be auctioned by Bank, so that she could bid the
Mat.Appeal No.242 of 2012 & conn. cases 28
property in public auction. That itself will show that 'E' and 'O'
schedule properties were not purchased by her.
41. The King Solomon's wisdom in judgment, is narrated
in   Holy Bible 1 Kings 3, 16-18.          Two mothers came to King
Solomon, each claiming an infant son as her own. Calling for a
sword, Solomon declared his judgment, the baby would be cut
into two, and each woman to receive half. One mother did not
contest the ruling declaring that, if she could not have the
baby, then neither of them could.             But, the other begged
Solomon to give the baby to other lady and not to kill the
baby.     The King declared the second woman to be the true
mother, as a mother would even give up his baby if that was
necessary to save its life, and awarded custody of the child to
42. We are reminded of this story on going through the
statement of PW1 Smt.Mini that, she did not repay the loan
amount        and requested the bank not to accept the loan
repayment from Sri.Joy hoping that, on default of the loan,
Bank would auction those properties, and then she could bid
the property in auction. That itself will show that, she was not
the real owner of 'E' and 'O' schedule properties, and she was
Mat.Appeal No.242 of 2012 & conn. cases  29
only a name lender in the real estate business transactions of
her husband.
43. Smt.Mini claims that she withdrew amounts from her
Bank Account in the year 2003 for purchasing 'E' and 'O'
schedule properties. It is difficult to believe that, she withdrew
amounts in the year 2003 for the purchase made in the year
2005. In Ext.X135 income tax return of Sri.Joy for the
assessment year 2006-2007, 'E' and 'O' schedule properties
are included.          That also is a circumstance to believe that,
those properties were purchased by Sri.Joy.
44. On analysing Exts.B5 and B19 transactions with the
six tests set out by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Java Dayal
Peddar's case (supra), it satisfies the requirements of a
benami transaction.             The parties are husband and wife in a
fiduciary relationship. There is nothing to show that 'E'
schedule property was purchased in the name of Smt.Mini for
her benefit. So, regarding 'E' schedule property (item Nos.1 to
3 in O.P No.559 of 2006) and 'O' schedule property in O.P
No.775 of 2006, Sri.Joy could prove that, he purchased those
properties expending his own money and                   'E' schedule
property was registered in the name of Smt.Mini only as a
Mat.Appeal No.242 of 2012 & conn. cases 30
name lender, and Sri.Joy was intended to be its beneficiary.
45. The Family Court found that 'O' schedule property in
the name of Sri.Joy covered by Ext.B19 sale deed belongs to
him, whereas 'E' schedule property in the name of Smt.Mini
covered by Ext.B5 sale deed belongs to her.        The finding of
the Family Court with respect to 'E' schedule property is liable
to be set aside. Since Smt.Mini was only a name lender in the
sale deed as well as in the Bank loan, she cannot have any
liability towards the Bank also with respect to loan A/c
No.1987 in Syndicate Bank, Housing Finance Branch, if at all
that loan is still outstanding.
III. 'D' (item No.4 in O.P No.559 of 2006) and 'P'
schedule property in O.P No.775 of 2006
46. Item No.4 in O.P No.559 of 2006 corresponds to 'D'
schedule in O.P No.775 of 2006. It is 4.875 cents of land
covered by Ext.B7 sale deed in Chembukavu village.           That
property stands in the name of Smt.Mini.
47.     'P' schedule property in O.P.No.775 of 2006 is the
adjoining 4.875 cents of land covered by Ext.B46 sale deed in
the name of Sri.Joy. That property is not scheduled by Sri.Joy
in O.P.No.559 of 2006, may be because, that property stands
Mat.Appeal No.242 of 2012 & conn. cases     31
in his exclusive name. Exts.B7 and B46 sale deeds were
executed on the very same day i.e., 14.06.2004. Ext.B113
commission report shows that these two properties are lying
48.      'P''    schedule         property   originally  belonged   to
Smt.Leela, mother of RW7. She executed settlement deed in
favour of her son Sri.Suresh.                    Smt.Leela and Sri.Suresh
executed Ext.B136 sale agreement in favour of Sri.Joy
agreeing to sell that property for Rs.97,500/- per cent.                The
advance amount was seen withdrawn from the account of
Sri.Joy     evidenced         by     Ext.X33.      Since   Sri.Suresh  died,
subsequently Ext.B3 sale agreement was entered into between
Smt.Leela and the other legal heirs of Sri.Suresh with Sri.Joy.
In Ext.B3 agreement also, the advance amount paid as per
Ext.B136 agreement is mentioned. PW1 Smt.Mini is not aware
of any such agreements, and according to her, she had not
written any agreements with respect to that property.
49. Sri.Joy wanted to construct a multi storied building
in 'D' and 'P' schedule properties as that land was close to
St.Thomas College, and Entrance Coaching Centre of Prof.P.C
Thomas.         For that purpose he wanted to get maximum
Mat.Appeal No.242 of 2012 & conn. cases    32
possible loan from the Bank. As the maximum personal loan
that could have been sanctioned per person was only
Rs.20 lakh, he decided to split the loan by adding his wife also.
RW24 Bank Manager supported the statement of Sri.Joy, that
the maximum loan permissible per person from his Bank was
only Rs.20 lakh. Since loan had to be availed in the name of
Smt.Mini also, two separate agreements were needed and it
was prepared accordingly.               Ext.X53 is the sale agreement in
the name of Smt.Mini dated 08.06.2004.                  Ext.B7 sale deed
was executed in the name of Smt.Mini on 14.06.2004 i.e. six
days after execution of Ext.X53 agreement.                 So, obviously,
Ext.X53 sale agreement was executed in the name of Smt.Mini
for the purpose of availing a separate loan in her name from
Syndicate Bank, Palace road branch, Thrissur.                 RW39, the
document writer, identified Ext.B3 agreement as well as
Exts.B7 and B46 sale deeds written by him. He categorically
stated that, those documents were written as instructed by
Sri.Joy and the expenses also were met by him.
50. Sri.Joy obtained plan and permit for constructing a
multi storied building. Since the sale deeds were separate, the
plan and permit were also separately obtained.                    Sri.Joy
Mat.Appeal No.242 of 2012 & conn. cases 33
entered into a contract with RW56 contractor for constructing
a building in 'D' and 'P' schedule properties.         RW56 gave
evidence to the effect that, as per instructions given by Sri.Joy,
he carried out the piling work and foundation work. PW1
Smt.Mini also is admitting the fact that, the foundation has
been built up in that property.            According to Sri.Joy, he
expended Rs.18 lakh for the foundation work. But, according
to Smt.Mini, it is only Rs.13 lakh, and it was spent by her, but
no evidence is forthcoming. The testimony of RW2, RW7 and
RW44 support the case of Sri.Joy that, he is possessing and
improving that property. All the documents with respect to the
construction work in 'D' schedule property is in possession of
Sri.Joy. Smt.Mini also admitted that, Sri.Joy is in possession
of the property at Thrissur.
51.     According to Sri.Joy, he was making repayment of
the loan by giving standing instructions to the Bank. Even after
Smt.Mini went back to her paternal house, he continued to
make repayment. Meanwhile, Smt.Mini issued Ext.A34 letter to
the Bank, not to accept repayment of the loan amount from
Sri.Joy with respect to 'D' schedule property.        So the Bank
stopped taking repayment from his account, as per the
Mat.Appeal No.242 of 2012 & conn. cases    34
standing instructions.             But, subsequently, he closed the loan
account in the name of Smt.Mini by way of One Time
settlement. Smt.Mini is not disputing that fact.
52. On analysing Ext.B7 and B46 transactions with the
six tests to be applied, it satisfies the requirements of a
benami transaction. So, regarding 'D' schedule (item No.4 in
O.P No.559 of 2006) and 'P' schedule property in O.P No.775
of 2006, Sri.Joy could prove that, he purchased those
properties expending his own money for his own benefit, and
the 'D' schedule property was registered in the name of
Smt.Mini only as a name lender.
53. The Family Court found that 'P' schedule property in
the name of Sri.Joy covered by Ext.B46 sale deed belongs to
him, whereas 'D' schedule property in the name of Smt.Mini
covered by Ext.B7 sale deed belongs to her.                The facts and
circumstances narrated above clearly show that, the finding of
the Family Court with respect to 'D' schedule property is liable
to be set aside. Since Smt.Mini was only a name lender in the
sale deed as well as in the Bank loan, she cannot have any
liability towards the Bank with respect to Ext.X52 loan A/c
No.1046 with Syndicate Bank, Palace road branch, Thrissur, if
Mat.Appeal No.242 of 2012 & conn. cases   35
at all that loan is still outstanding.
IV.     'J' schedule property (item No.5 in O.P No.559
of 2006) in O.P No.775 of 2006.
54.     This property is in the joint name of Sri.Joy and
Smt.Mini as per Ext.B6 sale deed.                 That document was
registered on 12.05.2004.               RW3 Ratnapalan and his wife are
the vendors in Ext.B6 document. Sri.Joy and his friend RW12
Sri.K.T Thomas entered into a sale agreement with the
vendors and an advance amount of Rs.1,20,000/- was given
as deposed by RW3.                Ext.B6 stamp paper was purchased in
the name of Sri.Joy alone. Out of the total extent, the eastern
portion was conveyed to RW12 and the western portion was
assigned in the joint name of Sri.Joy and Smt.Mini. RW3, the
vendor, deposed that, it was as instructed by Sri.Joy.              The
stamp paper for Ext.B6 is in the name of Sri.Joy alone, though
the document was executed in the joint name of Sri.Joy and
Smt.Mini. Sri.Joy availed loan from Vijaya Bank, Thrissur and
Ext.X322 is the legal opinion given for Bank loan.            The loan
was sanctioned in May 2004 and so the document was
registered on 12.05.2004. The credit vouchers for repayment
of the loan were signed by Sri.Joy and RW29 and RW67, Bank
Mat.Appeal No.242 of 2012 & conn. cases    36
Managers, produced Ext.X118 to Ext.X125 to prove that fact.
When the repayment became irregular, the Bank initiated
SARFAESI proceedings and then Sri.Joy approached DRT,
Ernakulam and obtained stay order. Later he settled the loan
by One Time Settlement remitting full amount and closing the
55.     PW1 Smt.Mini would say that, she purchased that
property expending her own money in the joint name of
herself and her husband.                 She is not even aware of the
description of that property.               In item No.5, two items of
properties are involved. The first item is 7 and odd cents and
the second item is 4 and odd cents in Chiyaram Village.              In
O.P No.775 of 2006, when Smt.Mini scheduled that property as
'J' schedule, the second item of 4 and odd cents was excluded.
Though she would say that, there was a sale agreement for
this property, she does not know its details. She is not able to
say   anything         about      the   agreement  for purchasing  that
property.        The total consideration for that property was
Rs.3,60,000/-.          Though she deposed that she has got some
documents to prove repayment of Rs.25,000/- towards the
loan amount, no documents are there to support.                  She is
Mat.Appeal No.242 of 2012 & conn. cases   37
admitting that, she had requested the Bank not to accept
repayment from Sri.Joy, as she knows that, on default, the
property would be auctioned, and then she could bid the same.
56. The repayment and closing of the loan by Sri.Joy is
not disputed by Smt.Mini.               RW3, the vendor, and RW39, the
scribe, deposed that the document was prepared and executed
as instructed by Sri.Joy.              RW42 and RW44 speaks about the
possession of that property by Sri.Joy. So, there is evidence to
show that though Ext.B6 sale deed is in their joint name,
Sri.Joy was the beneficial owner and Smt.Mini was a name
lender. There is nothing to show that Sri.Joy purchased that
property for the benefit of his wife Smt.Mini. So Ext.B6
document satisfied the requirements of a benami transaction.
57. The finding of the Family Court that, Smt.Mini is a
joint owner of 'J' schedule property is liable to be set aside in
the light of the facts and evidence discussed above.             Since
Smt.Mini was only a name lender in the sale deed as well as in
the Bank loan, she cannot have any liability with respect to the
Bank loan availed from Vijaya Bank, if at all that loan is still
Mat.Appeal No.242 of 2012 & conn. cases   38
V.      'A' schedule property (item No.8 in O.P No.559
of 2006) in O.P No.775 of 2006
58.       'A' schedule property is 14 cents of land in
Kadupassery village.              That property stands in the name of
Smt.Mini as per Ext.B20 sale deed. According to Sri.Joy, it is
his residential property and it is situated just opposite to his
tharavad house. According to him, 84 and odd cents of land
was purchased by his father Sri.Chakkunni from his brother in
the name of his two sons Sri.Joseph and Sri.Antu, who are the
elder brothers of Sri.Joy. Later father gave another property
to his son Sri.Joseph for building a house, and so, Sri.Joseph
relinquished his right over the 84 and odd cents in favour of
his brother Sri.Antu.            Later, Sri.Antu constructed a house in
another property given to him by his father. So, as permitted
by father, Sri.Joy constructed a house in 84 and odd cents of
property which was standing in the name of Sri.Antu.                The
house construction was started in the year 1994, and it was
over within an year.              Pursuant to enquiry from Income Tax
Department regarding the source for the building construction,
Sri.Antu executed a power of attorney in favour of Sri.Joy with
respect to 84 and odd cents standing in his name.                Sri.Joy
Mat.Appeal No.242 of 2012 & conn. cases 39
executed Ext.B20 sale deed regarding 14 cents of land and the
house situated therein, in favour of his wife Smt.Mini.
According to him, it was done in trust, and it was not
supported by consideration, and so that property along with
the house absolutely belongs to him, in spite of Ext.B20 sale
59. According to Smt.Mini, she belonged to an affluent
family and her brothers were working abroad. At the time of
marriage, she was given 75 sovereigns of gold ornaments and
Rs.2 lakh in cash. Her 60 sovereigns of gold ornaments and
the cash given from her family were all utilised for the house
construction and so, Sri.Joy executed Ext.B20 sale deed in her
favour using the power of attorney given by his brother
60.       RW4 Sri.Antu supported his brother Sri.Joy by
saying that Ext.B20 was not supported by consideration, and
as part of a family settlement, the said property was given to
Sri.Joy.       There are no documents to prove the family
settlement, except the oral testimony of RW1 and RW4. But in
O.P No.775 of 2006, Smt.Mini is admitting that Sri.Joy started
construction of the house in the property obtained from his
Mat.Appeal No.242 of 2012 & conn. cases   40
tharavad.       But, according to her, since her patrimony was
utilised for construction of the house, Sri.Joy had agreed to
convey the house and the appurtenant land in her name.
Though Sri.Joy is disputing the quantum of gold and money
received from her family, he has no case that no gold or
money       was      received        from  her family. During cross
examination, he was even pleading ignorance regarding
employment of brothers of Smt.Mini in foreign countries,
though they lived together as husband and wife for about
16½ years. But later he admitted that some of them are
working abroad.             When he was asked whether the family
members of Smt.Mini are educated and financially well off, he
pleaded ignorance and added that he had not enquired into.
That itself will speak volumes about his nature and character.
61. RW4 Sri.Antu, the brother of Sri.Joy, admitted before
court that he is working in Bombay and he used to come to his
native, two three times in an year, and every time he used to
see his brother Sri.Joy. He obtained half right over 84 and odd
cents of property in the year 1981. Subsequently, his brother
Sri.Joseph relinquished his half right in favour of Sri.Antu in
the year 1986. Sri.Joy was permitted to construct the house
Mat.Appeal No.242 of 2012 & conn. cases 41
in that property and he started construction in the year 1994
and according to Sri.Joy, the construction was completed
within one year. Even according to Sri.Joy, the Income Tax
Department enquired about the source only in the year 1996-
1997.       In order to avoid trouble to Sri.Antu, change of
ownership was necessary for which Sri.Antu executed Ext.B21
power of attorney on 01.06.1998.
62. Ext.B21 power of attorney shows that Sri.Antu was
very much available in his native for executing and registering
that document before Vadakkumkara SRO.           If the entire 84
and odd cents was intended to be given to Sri.Joy as part of
family settlement, instead of executing Ext.B21 power of
attorney, straight away he could have executed a sale deed or
settlement deed in favour of Sri.Joy.      The explanation given
by Sri.Joy is that, in order to avoid ceiling problems and
income tax issues, 14 cents and the house situated therein
were transferred in the name of Smt.Mini. There is nothing to
show that in the year 1998 or on any day prior to that, Sri.Joy
was having any land registered in his name. He was not an
income tax payee during that period.        If so, there was no
necessity for executing Ext.B20 document in the name of
Mat.Appeal No.242 of 2012 & conn. cases 42
Smt.Mini to save the land ceiling limit of Sri.Joy or to escape
from income tax problems. According to Sri.Joy, since he was
the power of attorney holder, if the property was transferred
into his own name, in future transactions, it might have been
subjected to legal scrutiny, and that is why the document was
not executed in his name. But, using the very same power of
attorney, he transferred the balance 70 and odd cents in the
name of himself, his wife Smt.Mini and son Milan. So, it is not
a justification for not transferring 'A' schedule property his
name on the basis of the power of attorney, if the property
was really intended to be given to him.
63. In Ext.B20, the consideration shown is Rs.40,000/-.
Smt.Mini would say that during that period, the business of
Sri.Joy was dull, and using her patrimony the house was
constructed and that was also a consideration for transferring
that property along with the house into her name. Sri.Joy
himself is the vendor in Ext.B20 sale deed. According to him,
that transaction was only a benami, and it was not intended to
benefit his wife.
64.     A person alleging benami transaction has to prove
the same, otherwise the property standing in the name of a
Mat.Appeal No.242 of 2012 & conn. cases   43
person could be presumed as, that person is its real owner. In
Ext.B20 sale deed, it is clearly mentioned that Smt.Mini is a
business woman.            It is mentioned in that document that the
property was worth Rs.15,000/- and the partly constructed
house was worth Rs.25,000/-.                 Thus the total consideration
was fixed at Rs.40,000/-.               Moreover, there is recital in that
document that the said property and partly constructed house
was given possession to Smt.Mini even prior to that document.
Sri.Joy signed that document as the power of attorney holder
of Sri.Antu. The stamp paper for executing that document was
purchased in the name of Smt.Mini.
65.      In paragraph 11 of the counter affidavit filed by
Sri.Joy in O.P No.775 of 2006, it is categorically admitted that
he had informed the Income Tax authorities that, with the help
of Smt.Mini and her parents, the house was constructed.
Ext.A3 Basic Tax Register, A4 encumbrance, A5 building tax,
A8 ownership certificate are all in the name of Smt.Mini.
There is nothing to disbelieve the case of Smt.Mini that, for
her patrimony utilised for the house construction, Sri.Joy
agreed to transfer the house and the appurtenant land in her
favour.     If the entire 84 and odd cents were transferred in
Mat.Appeal No.242 of 2012 & conn. cases 44
favour of Smt.Mini, we could have presumed that for the
purpose of saving the ceiling or to defraud the Income Tax
authorities, such a document was executed. Keeping 70 and
odd cents with him, he transferred only the house and
appurtenant 14 cents of land in favour of his wife. So,
obviously, his intention was to give that property and house in
favour of his wife.
66. Initially, at the time of construction, the documents
of the house such as electricity connection, building tax
assessment etc. were in the name of Sri.Joy.            Subsequently,
the house was transferred in favour of Smt.Mini. Being
husband and wife living together without any problems, they
might not have been eager to change the name in those
registers, soon after the transfer of the property. So, the fact
that still the electricity connection and building tax assessment
register are in the name of Sri.Joy is of no avail to him, as it is
quite common in every family relationship.
67.       Learned Senior Counsel appearing for Sri.Joy,
Sri.S.Sreekumar,            pointed out that during cross examination
Smt.Mini took a stand that she paid money to RW4 Sri.Antu in
cash, as sale consideration, but there is no evidence to prove
Mat.Appeal No.242 of 2012 & conn. cases 45
that fact. Sri.Joy also has no case that he paid any
consideration to Sri.Antu. If it was part of a family settlement,
Sri. Antu might have executed a settlement deed in favour of
Sri.Joy. Since her patrimony was utitilised for the construction
of the house,          the document might have executed as a sale
deed on valid consideration. The recitals in Ext.B20 document
itself shows that the property and the house were given prior
possession to Smt.Mini and the house in that property was an
incomplete one.             Sri.Joy cannot deny the recitals in that
document as he himself executed that document in favour of
his wife. If at all that property was set apart to him as a family
arrangement, there was arrangement between Sri.Joy and
Smt.Mini, to give the house and the appurtenant land to
Smt.Mini for the patrimony utilised for the house construction
and also the financial assistance received from her family, and
that is why only 14 cents of land and the house was conveyed
in favour of Smt.Mini, keeping the balance 70 cents with him.
Smt.Mini is not making any claim over that 70 cents of land
which is item No.17 in O.P No.559 of 2006. Moreover, there is
categoric admission from the part of Sri.Joy that he had
informed the Income Tax authorities that the house was
Mat.Appeal No.242 of 2012 & conn. cases 46
constructed with the financial assistance of Smt.Mini and his
parents. So, even if there is no evidence to prove payment of
any amount by Smt.Mini to Sri.Antu, it could be treated as a
valid transfer from her husband on consideration of her
patrimony he had taken.
68. So the available facts and evidence are sufficient to
hold that Ext.B20 document was not a benami transaction. It
was knowingly executed by the husband in favour of his wife
for the financial assistance received from the wife and her
family for constructing the house. She was not a benamidar
and the husband was not the beneficial owner to claim title
over that property.
69.      When the relationship between the parties is so
close as husband and wife, the source of consideration plays a
minor part, the more important and significant factor will be
the motive behind the transaction. Sri.Joy failed to prove the
alleged motive that for the purpose of saving the land ceiling
and to answer the Income Tax Department, such a document
was executed in favour of his wife. As already stated, there is
nothing to show that Sri.Joy was having an inch of land or
taxable income in his name during that period. So, Smt.Mini is
Mat.Appeal No.242 of 2012 & conn. cases   47
the absolute owner of 'A' schedule property and the house
situated therein and so, she is entitled to get the relief of
mandatory injunction as well as prohibitory injunction prayed
for with respect to 'A' schedule property. So, the finding of the
Family Court with respect to 'A' schedule property is liable to
be upheld.
VI.      'B' & 'C' schedule property (item 6 & 7 in
O.P No.559 of 2006) in O.P No.775 of 2006
70. These properties stand in the name of Smt.Mini as
per Ext.B8 and B9 documents.                  The consideration for item
No.6 ('B' schedule) is Rs.75,000/- and the consideration for
item No.7 ('C schedule') is Rs.52,500/-. These properties are
lying together as a single plot.             Sri.Joy is a witness in these
two documents.            RW17 Sri.Nandakumar entered into a sale
agreement with Sri.Joy on the basis of power of attorney
executed by its owners. He deposed that, the document was
executed in the name of Smt.Mini as instructed by Sri.Joy and
he had never seen Smt.Mini when the agreement was drawn
up or the document was registered.                      But, no such sale
agreement         was      produced     by   Sri.Joy   to  show   that  an
agreement was there between himself and RW17. According
Mat.Appeal No.242 of 2012 & conn. cases 48
to Sri.Joy, the fixed deposits in Union Bank of India, Nenmara
Branch was utilised for purchasing these properties.      He is
relying upon Ext.X117 ledger extract produced by RW28 Bank
Manager to say that 10 fixed deposits of Rs.43,150/- each was
closed on 10.04.1999. The total consideration needed as per
the document was only Rs.1,27,500/-. Even if he closed fixed
deposits worth Rs.4,31,500/- it might have been for some
other purpose.          The document was executed on 12.04.1999
and it was registered on 13.04.1999.       So, we cannot expect
that the amount was withdrawn from the Bank three days
prior to the execution and registration of the document.
71.     Smt.Mini deposed that business of Sri.Joy was dull
during that period and that is why in a portion of his rented
shop, a telephone booth and beauty parlour were started for
her. She was getting income from there. Moreover her family
members who were employed abroad financially assisted her.
Even if it is taken for argument's sake that Sri.Joy expended
money and purchased that property, in the name of his wife,
there is nothing to show that it was not for her benefit. The
purchase by the husband in the name of his wife, unless a
different intention is proved, it could only be treated as a
Mat.Appeal No.242 of 2012 & conn. cases   49
purchase for her own benefit, and not for the benefit of the
72. Smt.Mini is relying on Ext.A52 Account to show that
on the date of execution of Exts.B8 and B9 documents,
Rs.80,000/- was withdrawn from her account. Though Sri.Joy
is admitting that withdrawal, according to him, all money in
the account of Smt.Mini belonged to him and he was dealing
with the money in all her bank accounts. That statement
cannot be accepted, as Smt.Mini was also having income from
telephone booth and beauty parlour, and she was an income
tax assessee.
73. Smt.Mini deposed that she is possessing and taking
income from 45 cents of land. 'A', 'B' and 'C' schedule
properties together comes around to 45 cents. There is
nothing to suggest that Exts.B8 and B9 transactions were
benami transactions made by the husband in the name of wife,
for his own beneficial interest. He himself is a witness in these
two documents, and even if he expended any money for
purchasing that property, it was for her benefit only, as his
wife.       It    was      not     part of   his real estate business,
which seemingly started in the year 2004. So, Smt.Mini is the
Mat.Appeal No.242 of 2012 & conn. cases    50
absolute owner of 'B' and 'C' schedule properties and so, she is
entitled to get the relief of mandatory injunction as well as
prohibitory injunction with respect to those properties.          So,
the finding of the Family Court with respect to 'B and 'C'
schedule property (item 6 and 7) is liable to be upheld.
VII. 'H' schedule property (item 15 in O.P No.559
of 2006) in O.P No.775 of 2006
74.      This      property       is  extending 2.200 cents  in
Kaduppassery village in the joint name of Sri.Joy and
Smt.Mini. The total consideration shown is Rs.5,500/-. It was
purchased for laying pipelines and also as a pathway to the
house in 'A' schedule and to the properties of Sri.Joy. As we
have seen, 'A' schedule property was transferred by Sri.Joy in
favour of his wife Smt.Mini as per Ext.B20 sale deed.             We
found that the said property along with the partly constructed
house was transferred by Sri.Joy in her name, in consideration
of the patrimony and financial assistance received from her
family. So, when a small strip of land was purchased for the
purpose of providing pathway to that house and also to the
remaining properties of Sri.Joy, we cannot presume that the
said pathway was purchased by Sri.Joy for his own benefit,
Mat.Appeal No.242 of 2012 & conn. cases 51
and his wife was included in that document only as a name
75. It is true that, RW1 Sri.Joy produced Ext.B16 original
title deed of that property. RW5 deposed that his father sold
that property to Sri.Joy. According to Smt.Mini, she purchased
that property in the joint name of herself and husband, for the
benefit of herself and Sri.Joy was only a name lender. As we
have already seen, Section 3(2)(a) of the Benami Transactions
(Prohibition) Act, 1988 does not contemplate purchase of
property by a person in the name of her husband so as to
claim exemption under Section 3(2).            Moreover, there is
nothing to show that even if Smt.Mini purchased that property,
it was for her own benefit and not for the benefit of her
husband also. So, Ext.B16 document cannot be termed as a
benami transaction by which Sri.Joy remained the beneficiary,
though the document was executed in the joint name of
himself and his wife.
76.     According to Sri.Joy, 'H' schedule property is lying
contiguous with his remaining properties.        He himself would
admit that the said property was purchased for the purpose of
pathway to the house, as well as to his remaining properties.
Mat.Appeal No.242 of 2012 & conn. cases 52
Smt.Mini was running a telephone booth and a beauty parlour
and she was an income tax assessee during that period. So,
we cannot assume that she was not in a position to pay
consideration of Rs.5,500/- for purchasing that property. If at
all the consideration was paid by Sri.Joy, the property was
purchased in the joint name of husband and wife for the
benefit of both, and so, it cannot be termed as a benami
transaction. No motive to infer otherwise is conspicuously
absent, except the self-serving statement of Sri.Joy.
77. Production of the original title deed by the husband
is of no significance as due to some matrimonial discord, on a
fine morning the wife returned to her paternal house. When
her life itself was put on a question mark, we cannot expect
her to take the documents of the properties purchased over a
period, to prosecute or defend the cases which may arise in
future. PW1 Smt.Mini deposed that after she left to her
paternal house, her brothers mediated to settle their issues,
but Sri.Joy was not ready to give up his illicit connection with
Smt.Kala and so she filed Divorce O.P without any delay.
78.      From the available facts and circumstances, the
finding of the Family Court that Sri.Joy and Smt.Mini are joint
Mat.Appeal No.242 of 2012 & conn. cases  53
owners of 'H' schedule property (Item No.15 in O.P.No.559 of
2006) is to be upheld.
VIII. 'L' schedule property (item No.9 in O.P
No.559 of 2006) in O.P No.775 of 2006
79.      This property is extending 15 cents of land and it
was purchased in the joint name of Sri.Joy, Smt.Mini and Milan
as per Ext.B10 sale deed.               RW9 Sri.Jose and his brother
executed Ext.B10 document and he would say that the name
of Smt.Mini and Milan were included as instructed by Sri.Joy.
The sale consideration of Rs.15,000/- was paid by Sri.Joy by
withdrawing amounts from his account as seen from Ext.X33.
The stamp papers for executing the sale deed was purchased
in the name of Sri.Joy alone. The possession of the property
was also handed over to Sri.Joy as deposed by RW9. Sri.Joy is
possessing and improving that property even going by the
admission of PW1 Smt.Mini.              The case of Smt.Mini was that
she paid the entire consideration for purchasing that property.
But, during cross examination, she would say that, they
together paid the consideration. There is nothing to show that
Smt.Mini was engaged in real estate business, whereas from
the very beginning the case of Sri.Joy is that he was doing real
Mat.Appeal No.242 of 2012 & conn. cases   54
estate business and he had purchased large extent of
properties in the name of various persons including his wife
and child even without their knowledge. There is no positive
evidence from the side of Smt.Mini to show that she expended
money for purchasing 'L' schedule property. There is nothing to
show that Sri.Joy purchased that property for the benefit of
Smt.Mini and Milan.              It has to be found that Smt.Mini and
Milan were only name lenders and the property was purchased
by Sri.Joy for his own benefit as part of his real estate
business and not for the benefit of Smt.Mini or Milan. So the
finding of the Family Court with respect to 'L' schedule
property is liable to be set aside.
IX.      'N' schedule property (item No.10 in O.P
No.559 of 2006) in O.P No.775 of 2006
80.      This property is extending 12 cents of land and it
was purchased in the joint name of Sri.Joy, Smt.Mini and Milan
as per Ext.B11 sale deed dated 03.09.2005.                 RW68, the
vendor of that property is a relative of Sri.Joy.         He deposed
that Sri.Joy paid the consideration, and as per his instructions,
the     name of Smt.Mini and Milan were included in that
document.        Possession of that property was given to Sri.Joy.
Mat.Appeal No.242 of 2012 & conn. cases 55
The sale consideration was paid by way of cheque drawn from
the account of Sri.Joy with Syndicate Bank, Palace road,
Thrissur, as borne out from Ext.X40 bank statement.          The
stamp paper for Ext.B11 was purchased in the name of Sri.Joy
alone. That        property is paddy land and PW1 Smt.Mini also
admitted in her cross examination that Sri.Joy had made
plantain cultivation in that property.     The testimony of RW44
and RW49 supported possession of that property by Sri.Joy.
Smt.Mini was not able to say about the details of that
purchase, or the payment of consideration with respect to that
81. Since there is clear evidence to show that Sri.Joy
paid the entire consideration, it has to be held that the said
property was purchased by him and there is nothing to show
that it was purchased for the benefit of Smt.Mini or Milan.   As
part of his real estate business, he might have purchased that
property in the name of his wife and son, and there is nothing
to show that it was purchased for their benefit. So, the finding
of the Family Court that Smt.Mini is a co-owner of 'N' schedule
property along with Sri.Joy and Milan is liable to be reversed.
It has to be found that Smt.Mini and Milan were only name
Mat.Appeal No.242 of 2012 & conn. cases  56
lenders and the property was purchased by Sri.Joy for his own
benefit and not for the benefit of Smt.Mini or Milan.
X.       'M' schedule property (item No.11 in O.P
No.559 of 2006) in O.P No.775 of 2006
82.      This property is extending 15 cents of land and it
was purchased in the joint name of Sri.Joy, Smt.Mini and Milan
as per Ext.B12 sale deed dated 30.03.2005. RW8, the vendor
of that property is a relative of Sri.Joy.           He deposed that
Sri.Joy paid the consideration, and as per his instructions, the
name of Smt.Mini and Milan were included in that document.
Possession of that property was given to Sri.Joy.            The sale
consideration was Rs.22,500/-.              Exts.X33 and X160 were
relied upon by Sri.Joy to prove withdrawal of amounts to pay
the consideration.            Smt.Mini was not serious in challenging
Exts.X33 and X160 documents.
83. Item No.17, 9 ('L' schedule) and this property were
all purchased by Sri.Joy on the very same date i.e. on
03.03.2005.             The    stamp    paper for  executing  Ext.B12
document was purchased in the name of Sri.Joy alone. RW16,
the scribe, deposed that as per the instructions of Sri.Joy, the
document was written in the joint names of Sri.Joy, Smt.Mini
Mat.Appeal No.242 of 2012 & conn. cases    57
and Milan. Possession of that property by Sri.Joy is spoken to
by RWs 44, 48 and 49. There is nothing to show that Smt.Mini
purchased that property in the joint name of her husband and
his son, paying consideration, as claimed by her.          Since there
is clear evidence to show that Sri.Joy paid the entire
consideration, it has to be held that the said property was
purchased by him, and there is nothing to show that it was
purchased for the benefit of Smt.Mini or Milan.          As part of his
real estate business, he might have purchased that property,
along with item No.9, 11 and 17 on the very same day,
including the name of his wife and son and there is nothing to
show that it was purchased for their benefit. So, the finding of
the Family Court that Smt.Mini is a co-owner of 'M' schedule
property along with Sri.Joy and Milan is liable to be set aside.
XI.      'I', 'G' and 'F' schedule property (item No.12,
13 and 16 in O.P No.559 of 2006) in O.P No.775 of 2006
84. These three properties were purchased in the joint
name of Sri.Joy and Smt.Mini as per Exts.B13, B14 and B17
documents respectively.                 All the three documents were
executed on 20.04.2004 and registered on 21.04.2004 and
22.04.2004.          The original sale deeds of all these properties
Mat.Appeal No.242 of 2012 & conn. cases   58
were produced by Sri.Joy.                  Schedule 'I' (item 12) was
purchased from one Sri.Davis, and RW46, the brother of the
vendor, deposed that Sri.Joy purchased that property paying
consideration to Sri.Davis.             'G' schedule (item No.13) was
purchased from RW6 Sri.Chandran. He also deposed that the
property was purchased by Sri.Joy and the consideration also
was paid by him. 'F' schedule property (item No.16) was
purchased from RW11 Smt.Annie and she also deposed that
the property was purchased by Sri.Joy and he paid the
consideration. According to the document writer, as instructed
by Sri.Joy, the name of Smt.Mini was included in the
85. Sri.Joy produced Bank Account statements to prove
the source of money to pay the consideration, and Smt.Mini
has no serious disputes with respect to the bank statements
produced by Sri.Joy.            According to her, his bank statements,
were fake and money of several persons credited in his
account were returned to the parties concerned. As already
stated in paragraph 18, we are not aware of the legality of the
money dealings made by Sri.Joy and the concerned authorities
will look into it.            The stamp papers for executing those
Mat.Appeal No.242 of 2012 & conn. cases    59
documents were all purchased in the name of Sri.Joy alone.
His possession is spoken to by the witnesses. There is nothing
to show that Smt.Mini purchased that property in the joint
name of herself and her husband, paying consideration, as
claimed by her.            Since there is clear evidence to show that
Sri.Joy paid the entire consideration, it has to be held that the
said property was purchased by him and there is nothing to
show that it was purchased for the benefit of Smt.Mini also.
As part of his real estate business, he might have purchased
those properties on the very same day, in the name of his wife
also. So, the finding of the Family Court that Smt.Mini is a co-
owner along with Sri.Joy with respect to 'I', 'G' and 'F'
schedule property is liable to be set aside.
XII. 'K' schedule property (item No.14 in O.P
No.559 of 2006) in O.P No.775 of 2006
86. This property is extending 38½ cents of land and it
was purchased in the joint name of Sri.Joy, and Smt.Mini as
per Ext.B15 sale deed.                  The total consideration for that
property was Rs.16,500/-. Ext.B24 is the sale agreement with
respect to that property dated 22.04.2004.                   In the sale
agreement        itself,     possession     handed  over  to   Sri.Joy is
Mat.Appeal No.242 of 2012 & conn. cases 60
specifically stated. That property is part of paddy land where
Sri.Joy cultivated plantains and PW1 Smt.Mini also admitted
cultivation of that property by Sri.Joy.         Possession of that
property by Sri.Joy is spoken to by neighbours.                Ext.X3
Account substantiates payment of advance amount from the
account of Sri.Joy and Smt.Sreekala by way of Demand Draft.
The case of Smt.Mini that she entrusted money with Sri.Joy to
purchase that property is not correct in the light of Ext.X3
bank statement.             There is nothing to show that Smt.Mini
purchased that property in the joint name of herself and her
husband paying consideration as claimed by her.          Since there
is clear evidence to show that Sri.Joy paid the entire
consideration, it has to be held that the said property was
purchased by him, and there is nothing to show that it was
purchased for the benefit of Smt.Mini also.        As part of his real
estate business, he might have purchased that property in the
name of his wife also. So, the finding of the Family Court that
Smt.Mini is a co-owner along with Sri.Joy            in 'K' schedule
property is liable to be set aside.
XIII. 'Q' schedule property in O.P No.775 of 2006
87.       Smt.Mini included 19 items of movables in 'Q'
Mat.Appeal No.242 of 2012 & conn. cases      61
schedule, which, according to her, were given from her family,
which includes fridge, washing machine, furniture, microwave
oven etc. worth Rs.3 lakh.                       Sri.Joy specifically denied
entrustment of the movables from her family and according to
him, he purchased the same and he produced Exts.B33, B34,
B36 etc. to prove purchase of washing machine, fridge, T.V
etc. The furniture also belongs to him as deposed.                    Though
Smt.Mini could not produce any bills for purchase of the
furniture or household articles, it is a custom in Kerala that
when daughters are married away, household utensils and
furniture like cot, almirah etc. are gifted from her family. In
connection with housewarming ceremony also, it is a practice
that    household          articles     like    fridge,  washing     machine,
microwave oven etc. are being gifted from her family.                    The
very fact that, Sri.Joy is denying any kind of furniture or
household articles received from her family will speak about
his unfair nature. Though reluctantly he is admitting that the
brothers of Smt.Mini were working abroad and all her siblings
were well placed. In such a situation, his statement that no
furniture or household articles were received from her family is
liable to be disbelieved.               He is not denying 'Q' schedule
Mat.Appeal No.242 of 2012 & conn. cases 62
movables in the house situated in 'A' schedule. He produced
Ext.B33 bill for washing machine, Ext.B34 bill for fridge and
Ext.B34(a) bill for T.V and Ext.B36 bill for the mixer grinder.
We have found that the 'A' schedule property and the house
situated therein absolutely belongs to Smt.Mini and so much
so, the movables if any in that house also belongs to her,
except the items over which Sri.Joy is claiming title as per the
bills produced by him. So, he has to vacate the house in 'A'
schedule property along with the movables therein except the
movables over which he is claiming title as per Ext.B33,
Ext.B34, Ext.B34(a) and Ext.B36 bills.      The total claim of
Smt.Mini towards 'Q' schedule movables is Rs.3 lakh. The bills
produced by Sri.Joy amounts to Rs. 51,150/- in total. If he
fails to hand over the movables in 'A' schedule house to
Smt.Mini, she can recover Rs.2,48,850/- towards the value of
88. When husband purchases property as part of his real
estate business joining his wife as a name lender in the title
document, even availing bank loans in her name to pay the
consideration, it cannot be said that the purchase was for the
Mat.Appeal No.242 of 2012 & conn. cases 63
benefit of the wife, when there is clear evidence to prove the
benami nature of the transaction. But when there is evidence
to show that the husband purchased the property or executed
document in favour of his wife, unless the contrary is proved,
it will be treated as the property of the wife purchased for her
benefit. The intention of the parties is a key factor in
determining the nature of the transaction, which could be
gathered from the relationship between parties, their conduct-
previous and subsequent to the transaction, source of money
for purchase, possession of the property, possession of the
title documents, repayment of loan, etc. etc.
In the light of the analysis we have made, Mat.Appeal
Nos.242 of 2012, 243 of 2012 and 317 of 2012 are allowed in
(i)     The finding of the Family Court with respect to
'A' , 'B', 'C' and 'H' schedule (item No.8, 6, 7
and 15 in O.P No.559 of 2006) in O.P No.775
(ii)    The finding of the Family Court with respect to
'O' and 'P' schedule in O.P No.775 of 2006 is
confirmed.
(iii) It is declared that Sri.Joy is the beneficial
owner of item No.17 in O.P No.559 of 2006,
Mat.Appeal No.242 of 2012 & conn. cases       64
and Smt.Mini             is injuncted from alienating
that property.
(iv) The finding of the Family Court with respect to
all other properties (immovable) in both
the     O.Ps are set aside as Sri.Joy is its
beneficial owner, and Smt.Mini is injuncted
from alienating the same.
(v)     Regarding 'Q' schedule movables, Smt.Mini is
entitled to receive the movables in the house
situated        in   'A'   schedule   property  except
the     articles covered by Ext.B33, Ext.B34,
Ext.B34(a) and Ext.B36 bills produced by
Sri.Joy, or its equivalent value Rs.2,48,850/-
from Sri.Joy and his assets.
