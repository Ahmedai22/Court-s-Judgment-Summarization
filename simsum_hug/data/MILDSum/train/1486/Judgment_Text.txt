Nos.1 and 2.
1       In the present PIL the Petitioner prays for two reliefs, (i) to postpone
the JEE (Main) exam to be held in January 2023 and (ii) to relax the
eligibility criteria of obtaining 75% marks in the 12th standard examination.
2       As far as the challenge to the eligibility criteria of obtaining 75%
marks in the 12th standard examination is concerned, the learned Advocate
of the Petitioner submits that he has received the copy of Affidavit-in-Reply
filed by the Respondent just now and seeks time to file Rejoinder and argue
the matter. The eligibility criteria laid down viz. obtaining 75% marks in the
12th standard examination would be relevant at the time of seeking
admission to the professional course which would be after June 2023.

3     The present apprehension of the Petitioner is that for the
examinations as are scheduled to be held from 24 January 2023 to 31
January 2023, the students will have very less time for preparation. The
schedule was declared only on 15 December 2022, hardly 40 days time
was accorded to the students to prepare for examination. The learned
Advocate for the Petitioner submits that though in April 2023 another
opportunity is available to the students to appear for JEE (Main), each and
every attempt is counted. Moreover, as a less time is provided for
preparations, holding of examination in January 2023 would be detrimental
to the interest of students. The learned Counsel submits that the
examinations of JEE (Main) to be held in January 2023 may be postponed
to April 2023 and the examinations to be held JEE (Main) in April 2023 may
be postponed to May 2023.
4     The learned ASG submits that in the year 2019 and in the year 2020
JEE (Main) exams were held in January and April. In the year 2021
because of pandemic the examinations were held in four sessions i.e.
February, March, April and May.
5     The learned ASG further submits that the Petitioner does not have
locus standi to file the present PIL.
6      The JEE (Main) exams are held twice every year. Even if a student
does not fare well in January exam, he can appear in April for improvement
and the better marks obtained in either of the exams are taken into
7      Even if the student does not appear for JEE (Main) exam in January
2023, he can appear for JEE (Main) exam in April 2023.
8      It is not disputed that the schedule of the JEE (Main) examination of
January and April is applicable pan India. The Petitioner claims to be a
social activist and a child right activist. If any orders are passed today
directing postponement of JEE (Main) January 2023 examination, the same
may have a cascading effect on the future examination also. The next JEE
(Main) examination is held in April 2023, sufficient time would be available
to the students from January to April. In case, the student does not fare well
in January examination, he can compete JEE (Main) in April examination.
9      The extraordinary circumstances do not appear to exist for restraining
the Respondents from holding JEE (Main) examination in January 2023.
Lakhs of students must have been preparing for the examination. On the
basis of the present PIL on behalf of a child right activist, it would not be
appropriate to direct postponement of the examination scheduled pan India.

10     As far as the another challenge to the eligibility criteria is concerned,
the learned Advocate for the Petitioner has sought time to file Rejoinder.
