The respondent in O.P. No. 606 of 2019 on the file of the
Family Court, Ernakulam has filed this original petition under
Article 227 of the Constitution of India. He challenges the
order of the Family Court dated 07.03.2022 in I.A.No.5447 of
2019 in O.P.No.606 of 2019, whereby the petitioner was
directed to pay interim maintenance to the respondent at the
rate of Rs.15,000/- per month.
2.   On 22.09.2022 notice on admission was ordered to
be served on the respondent. The respondent entered
appearance through her learned Counsel.
3.   Heard the learned Counsel appearing for the
petitioner and learned Counsel appearing for the respondent.
4.   The petitioner is the father of the respondent.
Marriage between the petitioner and the mother of the
respondent    which   was  solemnized   on   12.11.1995    was
dissolved as per the order of the Family Court, Ernakulam
dated 18.06.2012. The respondent filed O.P. No. 606 of 2019
under Section 7 of the Family Courts Act, 1984 seeking a
O.P.(FC) No.505 of 2022
decree for payment of maintenance; both past and future.
The respondent also claims Rs.75,00,000/- towards her
marriage expenses. The petitioner has filed an objection
resisting   the   claims   of  the  respondent.   Meanwhile   the
respondent     filed  I.A.No.5447    of 2019    claiming  interim
maintenance at the rate of Rs.15,000/- per month. The
petitioner has filed an objection. After hearing both sides the
Family Court allowed I.A.No.5447 of 2019 and directed the
petitioner   to   pay   interim  maintenance    at  the  rate   of
Rs.15,000/- per month. Ext. P5 is a copy of that order.
5.    The learned Counsel appearing for the petitioner
would submit that considering the monthly income being
derived, the petitioner is not in a position to pay such an
amount. He has to look after his second wife, daughter, step
son and mother in law. He is getting only pension now, having
he retired voluntarily from service in the year 2019. The
learned Counsel appearing for the petitioner raises a legal
contention that what the respondent can claim is maintenance
as provided under Section 125 of the Code of Criminal
Procedure, 1973, by operation of Section 7(2) of the Family
O.P.(FC) No.505 of 2022
Courts Act, and therefore, the Family Court is not empowered
to order payment of interim maintenance. The learned
Counsel placed reliance on the decision in Abhilasha v.
Prakash and others [AIR 2020 SC 4355] in order to fortify
that contention.
6.     The contention of the learned Counsel appearing
for the respondent on the other hand is that the petitioner at
the time of retirement received a huge amount. He retired as
a Scientist, and therefore, his monthly pension is much more
than what is stated by him. When he has unhesitantly been
maintaining his present wife, daughter, step son and mother
in law, he cannot refuse to pay appropriate amount towards
monthly maintenance of his daughter, the respondent, who is
a medical student.
7.     The parties are Christians. The decision in Abhilasha
(supra) is regarding a claim under Section 20 of the Hindu
Adoption and maintenance Act, 1956. The said decision cannot
have applicable in this case. Explanation (f) of Section 7 of the
Family Courts Act confers jurisdiction upon the Family Courts to
try a suit or proceedings for maintenance.
O.P.(FC) No.505 of 2022
8.    The    Apex Court   in  Shaila Kumari    Devi   v.
Krishnana Bhagwan Pathak [(2008) 9 SCC 632] held
that so far as 'interim' maintenance is concerned, it is true
that Section 125 of the Code as it originally enacted did not
expressly empower the Magistrate to make an order directing
payment of interim maintenance. But the Code equally did not
prohibit the Magistrate from making such an order. Now,
having regard to the nature of proceedings, the primary
object to secure relief to deserted and destitute wives,
discarded and neglected children and disabled and helpless
parents and to ensure that no wife, child or parent is left
beggared and destitute on the scrap-heap of society so as to
be tempted to commit crime or to tempt others to commit
crime in regard to them, it was held that the Magistrate had
'implied power' to make orders to pay interim maintenance.
The jurisdiction of the Magistrate under Chapter IX (Order for
Maintenance of Wives, Children and Parents) is not strictly
criminal in nature. Moreover, the remedy provided by Section
125 of the Code is a summary remedy for securing reasonable
sum by way of maintenance. Hence, in the absence of any
O.P.(FC) No.505 of 2022
express bar or prohibition, Section 125 could be interpreted
as conferring power by necessary implication to make interim
order of maintenance subject to final outcome in the
9.    Going by the principles laid down in the aforesaid
decision,    a   Christian   daughter   is   entitled    to    claim
10.   The    contention  of  the  petitioner   is   that   the
respondent being the daughter can claim maintenance as
provided under Section 7(2) of Family Courts Act alone.
Section 7(2) enables a daughter to claim maintenance under
Section 125 of the Code. As per Section 125(1)(b) of the Code
an    unmarried     daughter   who   has   physical     or  mental
abnormality or injury whereby unable to maintain herself
alone can claim maintenance. Whether the respondent is
entitled to claim maintenance under common law or under
Section 125 of the Code alone is a matter to be decided by
the Family Court at the time of final adjudication. The claim of
the respondent for maintenance is a pending consideration of
the Family Court. Till such time the original petition is decided,
O.P.(FC) No.505 of 2022
the petitioner being the father has to pay interim maintenance
to his daughter, the respondent, who is pursuing her studies
in medicine.
11.   Rs.15,000/- per month is the interim maintenance
ordered to be paid. The respondent being a medical student,
her expenses include not only what is required for mere
sustenance, but also educational and also other expenses.
Considering the status and financial conditions of the parties,
we are of the view that the interim maintenance at the rate of
Rs.15,000/- is not exorbitant.
12.   In such circumstances, we refrain from interfering
with the impugned order in exercise of the jurisdiction of this
Court under article 227 of the Constitution of India. This
Original Petition is accordingly dismissed.
