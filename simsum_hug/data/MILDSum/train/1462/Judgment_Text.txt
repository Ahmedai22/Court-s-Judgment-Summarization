and Empowerment, New Delhi and Others
Counsel for Petitioner :- Gyanendra Singh
Counsel for Respondent :- A.S.G.I.
2.    The petitioner has sought following reliefs in this petition
filed under Article 226 of the Constitution of India:
"i). Issue a writ order or direction declaring the Section
4(2)(e) of the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes
(Prevention of Atrocities) Act 1989 and Rule 7(2) of the
Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of
Atrocities Rules) 1995, ultra- vires to Part III of the
Constitution of India upto the extent they both necessarily
directs for filing of 'charge sheet'.
ii) Issue a writ, order or direction in the nature of
certiorari quashing the impugned order dated 02.03.2022

P.S. Maheshganj, District Pratapgarh, under Sections 376-
D, 506 IPC and 3(2)(v) & 3(2)(va) of the Act 1989."
3.     Vide Relief No. 1, he has sought a declaration that
Section 4(2)(e) of the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes
(Prevention of Atrocities) Act 1989 (for short 'the Act 1989) and
Rule 7(2) of the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes
(Prevention of Atrocities Rules) 1995 (for short 'the Rules of
1995') be declared ultra vires Part III of the Constitution of
India to the extent the said provisions necessarily direct for
filing of charge sheet.
4.     In order to consider this issue and relief prayed for, we
need refer to Section 4 including sub-Section (2)(e) of the Act
1989 which reads as under:
''4. Punishment for neglect of duties. (1) Whoever, being a
public servant but not being a member of a Scheduled
Caste or a Scheduled Tribe, wilfully neglects his duties
required to be performed by him under this Act and the
rules made thereunder, shall be punishable with
imprisonment for a term which shall not be less than six
months but which may extend to one year.
(2) The duties of public servant referred to in sub-section
(1) shall include- (a) to read out to an informant the
information given orally, and reduced to writing by the
officer in charge of the police station, before taking the
signature of the informant;
(b) to register a complaint or a First Information Report
under this Act and other relevant provisions and to
register it under appropriate sections of this Act;
(c) to furnish a copy of the information so recorded
forthwith to the informant;
(d) to record the statement of the victims or witnesses;
(e) to conduct the investigation and file charge sheet in
the Special Court or the Exclusive Special Court within a
period of sixty days, and to explain the delay if any, in
writing; to correctly prepare, frame and translate any
document or electronic record;
(g) to perform any other duty specified in this Act or the
rules made thereunder:
Provided that the charges in this regard against the public
servant shall be booked on the recommendation of an
administrative enquiry.
(3) The cognizance in respect of any dereliction of duty
referred to in sub-section (2) by a public servant shall be
taken by the Special Court or the Exclusive Special Court
and shall give direction for penal proceedings against such
public servant."
Rule 7 of the Rules of 1995 including sub-Rule (2) thereof,
vires of which has been challenged, reads as under:
"7. INVESTIGATING OFFICER.-(1) An offence committed
under the Act shall be investigated by a police officer not
below the rank of a Deputy Superintendent of Police. The
investigating officer shall be appointed by the State
Government/Director General of Police/Superintendent of
Police after taking into account his past experience, sense
of ability and justice to perceive the implications of the
case and investigate it along with right lines within the
shortest possible time.
(2) The investigating officer so appointed under sub-rule
(1) shall complete the investigation on top priority, submit
the report to the Superintendent of Police, who in turn
will immediately forward the report to the Director
General of Police or the Commissioner of Police of the
State Government, and the Officer incharge of the
concerned police station shall file a charge sheet in the
Special Court or the Special Court within a period of sixty
days (the period is inclusive of investigation and filing of
charge-sheet).
(2-A) The delay, if any, in investigation or filing of
charge-sheet in accordance with sub-rule (2) shall be
explained in writing by the investigating officer.
(3) The Secretary, Home Department and the Secretary,
Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes Development
Department (the name of the Department may vary from
State to State) of the State Government or Union Territory
Administration, Director of Prosecution, the officer in-
charge of Prosecution and the Director General of Police
or the Commissioner of Police incharge of the concerned
State or Union Territory shall review by the end of every
quarter the position of all investigations done by the
investigating officer."
5.    In this context, the contention of learned counsel for the
petitioner was that the language used in the aforesaid two
provisions leaves no scope for the Investigating Officer to file a
final report in a case where no offence is made out under the
Act 1989, meaning thereby he has necessarily and mandatorily
to file a charge-sheet in every case in which an FIR is lodged
alleging an offence under the Act. In this context, he further
submitted that the word used in the aforesaid provisions is 'file
charge-sheet' and not 'file a police report'. Under Section 173 of
the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (hereinafter referred as
'Code 1973'), the term used is police report which may be in
the form of a charge-sheet or a final report, the former to be
filed in a case where the offence is made out based on the
evidence collected and the latter in case where the offence is
not made out, but, distinct from the language used in Section
173 of Code 1973, the provision contained in the Act 1989 and
the   Rules   of  1995   mention    the  word   'charge-sheet'.  He
submitted that this makes the provision unreasonable and hit by
Articles 14 and 21 of the Constitution of India.
6.    The apprehension in the mind of the petitioner seems to
have arisen on account of use of the word 'charge-sheet' instead
of 'police report' in the above quoted provisions. The provisions
have to be read and understood in a reasonable manner. What
the aforesaid two provisions mean is that wherever the offence
is made out as having been committed under the Act 1989
based on evidence collected during investigation, a charge-sheet
is required to be filed as is mentioned therein. If the suggestion
or argument of learned counsel for the petitioner is accepted
that even if no offence is made out, the charge-sheet has
necessarily to be filed or in every case where an FIR alleging
the offence under the Act 1989 is lodged, the Investigating
Officer is bound to file a charge-sheet with the Special Court or
the    Exclusive   Special   Court,   it  would    be    apparently
unreasonable, absurd and hit by Articles 14 and 21 of the
Constitution of India. Statutory provisions cannot be read,
understood and applied in an unreasonable manner so as to
lead to absurdity and/or to violate fundamental rights of a
citizen. Our understanding and interpretation of this provision
as mentioned hereinabove is the correct understanding of law
and the argument of learned counsel for the petitioner is
7.     In view of the above, it is held that the aforesaid
provisions do not necessarily mandate the Investigating Officer
to file a charge-sheet in each and every case where an FIR has
been lodged alleging commission of offence under the Act 1989,
but it only enjoins upon him to file such charge-sheet where,
based on evidence collected during investigation, the offence is
made out. Relief No. 1 is accordingly rejected.
8.     Vide Relief No. 2, petitioner has challenged the order
dated 02.03.2022 passed by the Special Court, Pratapgarh.
9.     The impugned order dated 02.03.2022 has been passed by
a Court of Sessions which has been specified as Special Judge
10.    The   contention   was    that  the    Exclusive    Special
Court/Special Court, Pratapgarh does not have power to order
lodging of FIR and investigation in respect thereof as is
prescribed under Section 156 (3) of Code 1973 In this context
reliance was placed upon the definition "Exclusive Special
Court" contained in Section 2(bd) which has been been defined
to mean the Exclusive Special Court established under sub-
Section (1) of Section 14 of the Act 1989 to exclusively try the
offences under the Act 1989. It was submitted that such Court
is established to try the offences under the Act 1989. Trial
commences only after charge is framed and not prior to it. The
process under Section 156(3) of Code 1973 is a pre-trial stage,
therefore, in view of aforesaid provision the Exclusive Special
Court does not have the power prescribed under Section 156(3)
of Code 1973. The term Special Court is defined under Section
2(d) of the Act 1989 to mean a Court of Sessions specified as a
Special Court in Section 14. As per the proviso to Section 14(1)
Special Courts are also specified to try the offences under the
11.   Section 14 of the Act 1989 reads as under:
"14. Special Court and Exclusive Special Court. (1) For the
purpose of providing for speedy trial, the State
Government shall, with the concurrence of the Chief
Justice of the High Court, by notification in the Official
Gazette, establish an Exclusive Special Court for one or
Provided that in Districts where less number of cases
under this Act is recorded, the State Government shall,
with the concurrence of the Chief Justice of the High
Court, by notification in the Official Gazette, specify for
such Districts, the Court of Session to be a Special Court
to try the offences under this Act:
Provided further that the Courts so established or specified
shall have power to directly take cognizance of offences
under this Act.
(2) It shall be the duty of the State Government to
establish adequate number of Courts to ensure that cases
under this Act are disposed of within a period of two
months, as far as possible.
(3) In every trial in the Special Court or the Exclusive
Special Court, the proceedings shall be continued from
day-to-day until all the witnesses in attendance have been
examined, unless the Special Court or the Exclusive
Special Court finds the adjournment of the same beyond
the following day to be necessary for reasons to be
recorded in writing:
Provided that when the trial relates to an offence under
this Act, the trial shall, as far as possible, be completed
within a period of two months from the date of filing of
the charge sheet."
12.   The submission based on the aforesaid provisions was, as
already mentioned earlier, such Courts are only empowered to
try the offences under the Act 1989 that is to hold trial in
respect thereof, but not to exercise any other power.
13.   Learned counsel for the petitioner also submitted that
while the power to take cognizance of a case directly has been
conferred upon the Exclusive Special Court/Special Court in the
second proviso to Section 14(1), no such power as is prescribed
in Section 156(3) of Code 1973 to order lodging of FIR and
investigation has been conferred upon the said Courts. In this
context, learned counsel for the petitioner invited our attention
to Rule 5 of the Rules of 1995 to contend that Rule 5(3) of the
Rules of 1995 is pari materia to Section 154(3) of Code 1973
and it provides a remedy/recourse to aggrieved person before
the concerned official if FIR is not lodged by the officials of the
14.    Rule 5 of the Rules of 1995 reads as under:
A POLICE STATION:-(1) Every information relating to the
commission of an offence under the Act, if given orally to
an officer in-charge of a police station shall be reduced to
writing by him or under his direction, and be read over
to the informant, and every such information, whether
given in writing or reduced to writing as aforesaid, shall
be signed by the persons giving it, and the substance
thereof shall be entered in a book to be maintained by
that police station.
(2) A copy of the information as so recorded under sub-
rule (1) above shall be given forthwith, free of cost, to
the informant.
(3) Any person aggrieved by a refusal on the part of an
officer incharge of a police station to record the
information referred to in sub-rule (1) may send the
substance of such information, in writing and by post, to
the Superintendent of Police concerned who after
investigation either by himself or by a police officer not
below the rank of Deputy Superintendent of Police, shall
make an order in writing to the officer in-charge of the
concerned police station to enter the substance of that
information to be entered in the book to be maintained
by that police station."
15.    He further invited our attention to Section 4 of the Act
1989 pertaining to punishment for neglect of duties under
which     if  the   duties  mentioned    therein,  which    includes
registration of a complaint or an FIR under the Act 1989 and
other relevant provisions, are not performed by the concerned
official, cognizance in respect of such dereliction of duty
referred to in sub-Section 2 of Section 4 of the Act 1989 by a
public servant shall be taken by the Special Court or the
Exclusive Special Court and it shall give direction for penal
proceedings against such public servant.
16.   He submitted that though power of taking cognizance of
such dereliction of duty and also ordering penal proceedings
have been conferred upon the Special Court, but no provision
has been made empowering them to order lodging of an FIR
and investigation in terms of Section 156(3) of Code 1973. The
Legislator in its wisdom has stopped short of saying so and has
stopped at the stage of Section 154(3) of Code 1973 by
incorporating a similar provision in rule 5 of the Rules of 1995,
but has not incorporated any such provision analogous to
Section 156(3) of Code 1973 in the Act 1989 or the Rules of
1995. Based on it, he submitted that this itself makes the
intention of the Legislator and the Rule making authority very
clear that no such power has been vested with the Exclusive
Special Court or the Special Court.
17.   In this context, he also invited attention of the Court to
Section 18A of the Act 1989 which has been inserted by Act
No. 27 of 2018 w.e.f. 20.08.2018 by which preliminary inquiry
is not required for registration of First Information Report
against any person nor approval for arrest is required. The
contention of learned counsel for the petitioner was that this
provision makes registration of FIR mandatory without any
preliminary inquiry.
18.   It was also the contention of learned counsel for the
petitioner that the word used in Section 156 is Magistrate,
which, the Exclusive Special Court or the Special Court is not.
In the case at hand, the order has been passed by a Court of
Sessions which is referred as Special Court and not by the
19.   The argument of learned counsel for the petitioner as
noticed earlier appeared quite attractive at first blush, however,
we find that as far as the definition of Exclusive Special Court
and Special Court under the Act 1989 read with Section 14 of
the said Act are concerned, no doubt on a reading of it the
said Courts had been established for trying the offences
committed under the Act 1989, but, by the Act No. 1 of 2016,
amendments have been made in Section 14, by which, inter
alia, a second proviso to Section 14(1) has been added. Courts
so established or so specified under Section 14(1) have been
given the power to directly take cognizance of the offence
under the Act 1989. Taking of cognizance is a pre-trial stage,
therefore, the contention that such Courts are only empowered
to try cases is incorrect.
20.   Now, we may consider the applicability of Code of
Criminal Procedure before the Exclusive/Special Court under the
21.   In the Act 1989 or the Rules of 1995, the procedure to be
followed by these Courts under the Act 1989 has not been
prescribed. Such procedure has been prescribed in the Code
1973 which contains the general law relating to criminal
22.   In this context it is relevant to refer to Section 4 of the
Code 1973 which reads as under:
"4. Trial of offences under the Indian Penal Code and
other laws. (1) All offences under the Indian Penal Code
(45 of 1860) shall be investigated, inquired into, tried,
and otherwise dealt with according to the provisions
hereinafter contained.
(2) All offences under any other law shall be investigated,
inquired into, tried, and otherwise dealt with according to
the same provisions, but subject to any enactment for the
time being in force regulating the manner or place of
investigating, inquiring into, trying or otherwise dealing
with such offences."
"5. Saving. Nothing contained in this Code shall, in the
absence of a specific provision to the contrary, affect any
special or local law for the time being in force, or any
special jurisdiction or power conferred, or any special
form of procedure prescribed, by any other law for the
time being in force."
23.   As per Sections 4 and 5 of Code 1973 all offences under
any other law (which shall include the Act 1989) shall be
investigated, inquired, tried and otherwise dealt with according
to the Code of Criminal Procedure subject to there being any
enactment on the subject containing a specific provision to the
contrary. We find that certain provisions of the Code 1973 have
specifically  been   excluded   from   their  application  to   the
proceedings under the Act 1989. Section 18 of the Act 1989
excludes the application of Section 438 of Code 1973 regarding
anticipatory bail. Sections 18 and 18A of the Act 1989 exclude
any    preliminary   inquiry  before   registration  of    a  First
Information Report contrary to the provisions contained in
Sections 154 and 156 of Code 1973 Section 19 excludes
applicability of Section 360 of the Code 1973. The applicability
of other provisions of the Code 1973 have not been excluded
specifically or generally, therefore, it leads us to reasonably
infer that other provisions of the Code 1973 will apply to the
Courts established and specified under the Act 1989, subject to
Section 20 thereof.
Section 20 of the Act 1989 provides as under:
"20. Act to override other laws.—Save as otherwise
provided in this Act, the provisions of this Act shall have
effect notwithstanding anything inconsistent therewith
contained in any other law for the time being in force or
any custom or usage or any instrument having effect by
virtue of any such law."
24.   As per Section 20 of the Act 1989 save as otherwise
provided in the Act 1989, the provisions of the said Act shall
have effect notwithstanding anything inconsistent therewith
contained in any other law for the time being in force or any
custom or usage or any instrument having effect by virtue of
any such law. Thus, subject to any inconsistency between the
Act 1989 and the Code 1973, the said Code 1973 would apply
unless it has been otherwise provided in the Act 1989 itself.
This would obviously refer to the exclusion from applicability of
Section 438 of Code 1973, etc. as referred in Sections 18, 18A
and 19 of the Act 1989. Apart from these three provisions,
there is no other provision in the Act 1989 excluding the
applicability of the Code 1973 to the proceedings under the Act
1989 which is also indicative of applicability of other provisions
of the Code 1973 including Section 156(3) of Code 1973, to
proceedings under the Act 1989. Sections 4(2) and 5 of the
Code 1973 support this reasoning.
25.   The provisions of Section 4 of the Act 1989 and Rule 5 of
the Rules of 1995 do not persuade the Court to hold that as
nothing has been said beyond the said provisions specially
empowering the Courts under the Act 1989 to order lodging of
FIR and investigation, this power cannot be exercised by such
Courts. Section 4 of the Act 1989 or Rule 5 of the Rules of
1995 which are being relied by the petitioners' counsel, do not
answer the situation where the concerned Police Officer does
not register the FIR and the Superintendent of Police also after
being informed in terms of Rule 5 of the Rules of 1995 does
not take any action. It is here that the Courts come into picture
as a victim cannot be left remediless. Section 4 of the Act 1989
does not answer or remedy this situation. The authority to
lodge an FIR is distinct from the authority to take cognizance
for dereliction of duty under Section 4 of the Act 1989. To say
that the Exclusive Special Court or Special Court has the power
to take cognizance of dereliction of duty in this regard under
Section 4 and also to direct penal proceedings but not to order
lodging of FIR and investigation appears unreasonable and
incongruous and it defeats the very object of the Act 1989.
26.   The question is what happens after non-compliance of
Rule 5(3) of the Rules of 1995 i.e., if the Officer-in-Charge/SHO
of PS concerned refuses to lodge the FIR and an application is
submitted before the higher Officer that is Superintendent of
Police, but he also does not take any action? of what use
would be the proceedings under Section 4 of the Act 1989
which empowers the Exclusive Special Court or the Special
Court to take cognizance of dereliction of duty on the part of
the   said   Officers that is   the   Officer-in-Charge/SHO     and
Superintendent of Police in not lodging the FIR, if there is no
power with the Exclusive Special Court or the Special Court to
order lodging of such FIR? There is nothing in the Act 1989 or
the Rules made thereunder to exclude the applicability of
Section 156(3) of Code 1973 to investigation of offences under
27.   After all why the Legislator specifically excluded only few
provisions    of  the Code   1973    from   their   application  to
proceedings under the Act 1989. The Act 1989 or the Rules of
1995 do not provide the procedure to be followed by such
Courts under the Act 1989, therefore, such procedure has to be
as per the Code 1973 which is the general law applicable
relating to criminal procedure in all Courts exercising criminal
jurisdiction. We may in this context again refer to Section 4(2)
of the Code 1973 according to which all offences under any
other law shall be investigated, inquired into, tried, and
otherwise dealt with according to the same provisions (Code of
1973), but subject to any enactment for the time being in force
regulating the manner or place of investigating, inquiring into,
trying or otherwise dealing with such offences. We have already
noticed that there is nothing inconsistent in the Act 1989 or the
Rules of 1995 viz-a-viz the provision contained in Section
156(3) of Code 1973 which obviously has to be applied after
the contingencies mentioned in Rule 5 of the Rules of 1995 are
satisfied. Rule 5 of course is analogous to Section 154 of Code
1973 Section 4 of the Act 1989 is an additional provision to fix
accountability on the officials who are liable for dereliction of
duties by not registering any case, but, this provision will not
exclude the powers of the Exclusive Special Court/Special Court
to order registering of FIR and its investigation in view of
Sections 4 and 5 of the Code 1973 read with Section 20 of the
Act 1989 according to which, as discussed, Section 156(3) of
the Code 1973 will apply.
28.    In view of the above discussions in the context of Sections
4 and 5 of the Code 1973 read with Section 20 of the Act
1989, in matters of investigation of an offence under the Act
1989, Section 156(3) of the Code 1973 shall apply.
29.    We may now consider Sections 156(3) and 190 of the
Section 190 of the Code 1973 reads as under:
"190. Cognizance of offences by Magistrates. (1) Subject to
the provisions of this Chapter, any Magistrate of the first
class, and any Magistrate of the second class specially
empowered in this behalf under sub- section (2), may take
cognizance of any offence-
(a) upon receiving a complaint of facts which constitute
(b) upon a police report of such facts;
(c) upon information received from any person other than
a police officer, or upon his own knowledge, that such
offence has been committed.
(2) The Chief Judicial Magistrate may empower any
Magistrate of the second class to take cognizance under
sub- section (1) of such offences as are within his
competence to inquire into or try."
30.   Considering the issue involved in this case, we may now
refer Section 156 of the Code 1973 which reads as under:
"156. Police officer's power to investigate cognizable case.
(1) Any officer in charge of a police station may, without
the order of a Magistrate, investigate any cognizable case
which a Court having jurisdiction over the local area
within the limits of such station would have power to
inquire into or try under the provisions of Chapter XIII.
(2) No proceeding of a police officer in any such case
shall at any stage be called in question on the ground
that the case was one which such officer was not
empowered under this section to investigate.
(3) Any Magistrate empowered under section 190 may
order such an investigation as above- mentioned."
31.   Under Section 156(3) of the Code 1973, any Magistrate
empowered under Section 190 may order such an investigation
as is mentioned in Section 156 quoted hereinabove.
32.   The second proviso to Section 14(1) of the Act 1989
provides that the Courts so established or specified shall have
power to directly take cognizance of the offences under the Act
1989, meaning thereby such Courts can exercise powers of
taking cognizance of an offence under the Act 1989 which as
per the Code of 1973 is a pre-trial stage and is referable to
Section 190 thereof. The Code of 1973 is an Act to consolidate
and amend the law relating to criminal procedure. Taking
cognizance of an offence is dealt with under the said Code in
Section 190. As per the said provision the power to take
cognizance of any offence vests with the Magistrate. According
to Section 193, except as otherwise expressly provided by this
Code or by any other law for the time being in force, no Court
of Sessions shall take cognizance of any offence as a Court of
original jurisdiction unless a case has been committed to it by
the Magistrate under this Code. Special Court under Section 14
of the Act 1989 is a Court of Sessions. However, the second
proviso to Section 14 (1) vests the power of taking cognizance
of an offence under the Act 1989 upon an Exclusive Special
Court or a Special Court (which is a Court of Sessions) directly
without the case being required to be committed by the
Magistrate concerned to it after its cognizance by the latter.
Section 190 of Code 1973 has therefore to be applied to
Exclusive Special Court/Special Court under the Act 1989
mutatis   mutandis,    meaning   thereby,  reference  therein   to
Magistrate will have to be understood as a reference to these
Courts under the Act 1989.      Reading of Section 190 of Code
1973 conjointly with second proviso to Section 14(1) of the Act
1989 will make it clear that the Exclusive Special Court or the
Special Court which is a Court of Sessions is empowered to
directly take cognizance of an offence, thus, it exercises powers
of a Court of original criminal jurisdiction and the exercise of
its jurisdiction in this regard is not fettered by the provisions of
Section 193 of Code 1973. Thus, in view of second proviso to
section 14 of the Act 1989 the power exercisable under Section
190 of Code 1973 by the Magistrate are exercisable by the
Exclusive Special Court or Special Court as has already been
33.    The fact that there is no specific provision in the Act 1989
empowering the Exclusive Special Court or the Special Court to
order lodging of an FIR          and    to investigate   the   offence
mentioned therein is irrelevant, as the second proviso to Section
14(1) of the Act 1989 leaves no doubt that such Courts exercise
original criminal jurisdiction. All offences under the Act 1989
are to be tried by such Courts under the Act 1989 and no other
Court has jurisdiction in this regard. They can also take
cognizance of an offence directly. Now, such cognizance of an
offence can be taken on a private complaint also in view of
Section 190 of Code 1973, application of which is not excluded
to the proceedings under the Act 1989.
34.    We have already held that Section 156(3) of         Code 1973
will apply to investigation of an offence under the Act 1989
and    as   per   Section  156(3)   of   Code   1973   a   Magistrate
empowered under Section 190 of Code 1973 can order such
investigation and as, in view of proviso to Section 14 of the Act
1989 read with Section 190 of Code 1973, it is the Courts
established or specified under the Act 1989 which can take
cognizance directly in respect of an offence under the Act 1989,
therefore,    the   Magistrate  can    not  and   should    not   take
cognizance of an offence under the Act 1989 as such power
when specifically vested with the Special Courts under the Act
1989 should be exercised by the latter as held in Shantaben
Burabhai Bhuriya vs. Anand Athabhai Chaudhari1,          therefore,
this power under Section 156(3) of Code 1973 has to be
exercised by such Exclusive or Special Courts and not the
35.    It would have been better if the Legislator would have
specifically provided for such powers to be exercised by the
Exclusive Special Court or the Special Court, but the fact of the
matter is that there is no specific exclusion of the power under
Section 156(3) of Code 1973 from being exercised by the Courts
established or specified under Section 14 of the Act 1989 and in
view of the second proviso to Section 14 of the Act 1989 as
these Courts have the power to take cognizance of an offence
directly and also to entertain a complaint directly as per Section
190 of Code 1973, then, the Magistrate would not have the
power to exercise jurisdiction under Section 190 in respect of
an offence under the Act 1989 and this power should only be
exercised by these Special Courts, although, if the Magistrate in
a given case erroneously takes cognizance of an offence under
the Act 1989 and then commits the case to the Special Court,
this by itself will not vitiate the proceedings/trial as has been
held by the Supreme Court in Shantaben Burabhai Bhuriya
(supra) and Ramveer Upadhyay & Anr. Vs. State of U.P. &
Anr.2. In view of Section 156(3) of Code 1973 thy can also
order lodging of FIR and investigation where the offence alleged
is under the Act 1989.
36.   Even at the cost of repetition, there is no exclusion of the
powers prescribed under Section 156(3) of Code 1973 for such
Courts established under the Act 1989. Once such Courts have
power to take cognizance of an offence which is referable to
Section 190 of Code 1973, directly, then, in view of the
language used in Section 156 of Code 1973 they can order
lodging of FIR and investigation into an offence under the Act
1989 in exercise of powers under Section 156(3) of Code 1973
37.   The word Magistrate under Section 156(3) of Code 1973
does not mean that the Exclusive Special Court or the Special
Court which is a Court of Sessions will not have the power
under the said provision, as, in the absence of any specific
exclusion, the provision will apply mutatis mutandis.
38.   In fact, exercise of such powers by the Exclusive Special
Court or the Special Court is also necessary so as to achieve the
object of the Act 1989 and ensure speedy justice to the victim
as these are Courts exclusively established or specified to deal
with offences under the Act 1989.
39.   A Full Bench of this Court has recently held vide
judgment    and   order   dated   17.10.2022    in  a   bunch   of
Applications under Section 482 of Code 1973 leading case being
Application under Section 482 No. 14443 of 2022; Naresh
Kumar Valmiki vs. State of U.P. and others that the Exclusive
Special Court or the Special Court under the Act 1989 can treat
the application under Section 156(3) of Code 1973 as a
complaint and proceed with it accordingly.
40.   In view of the above discussion, the order passed by the
Special Court dated 02.03.2022 is not without jurisdiction. We
are of the opinion that the Relief No. 2 is not liable to be
41.   As regards Relief No. 3, we find that the offences under
the Act 1989 are such which are referred to as atrocity in
Section 2(a) which has been defined to mean an offence
punishable under Section 3. Now, in Section 3 of the Act 1989
various offences are mentioned. Section 3(2)(v) provides that
whoever not being a Member of the Scheduled Caste or
Scheduled Tribe commits any offence under the Indian Penal
Code (45 of 1860) punishable with imprisonment for a term of
ten years or more against a person or property knowing that
such person is a member of a Scheduled Caste or a Scheduled
Tribe or such property belongs to such member, shall be
punishable with imprisonment for life and with fine. Now, the
offence of gang-rape, as is alleged in the FIR, is referable to
Section 376-D IPC and carries a sentence which shall not be
less than 12 years, which may extend to life, which shall mean
imprisonment for the remainder of that person's natural life and
with fine, therefore, clearly an offence of gang-rape is referable
to Section 3(2)(v) of the Act 1989. Section 506 IPC, as is
alleged in the FIR, is referable to schedule read with 3(2)(v) of
the Act 1989, therefore, both these offences are referable to the
Act 1989 and also amenable to the jurisdiction of the Exclusive
Special Courts or the Special Courts under the said Act.
42.          Section 3(2)(va) provides for punishment of an offence
specified          in   the   schedule  to  the   Act  1989    subject   to
contingencies mentioned therein. The punishment shall be as
specified in the Indian Penal Code for such offences and shall
also be liable to fine. Thus, it is incorrect to say that the
petitioner would be penalised under two provisions. It would
not be so.
43.            In any case grounds (gg) and (hh) in the writ petition
can be raised/seen at the appropriate stage before the Court
concerned and as of now it cannot be said that the petitioner
would be punished for the same offence under two provisions.
44.          In view of above discussion, we see no reason to grant
45.          All this is of course without prejudice to the rights of the
petitioner in the pending investigation or before the Trial Court,
if the occasion so arises.
46.          Subject to above, the petition is dismissed.
