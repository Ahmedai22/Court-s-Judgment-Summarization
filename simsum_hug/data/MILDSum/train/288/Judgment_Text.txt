(ii) For issuance of any other relief or
reliefs for which the petitioner is found entitled
Learned counsel for the petitioner prays that the
petition be disposed of in terms of order dated 9 th January, 2020
passed in CWJC No. 20598 of 2019 titled as Md. Shaukat Ali
Vs. The State of Bihar and subsequent order dated 14th
January, 2020 passed in CWJC No.17165 of 2019 titled as
Umesh Sah Versus the State of Bihar & Ors. and order dated
29.01.2020 passed in CWJC No.2050 of 2020 titled as
Learned counsel for the respondents has no
objection to the same.
The Bihar Prohibition and Excise Act, 2016
(hereinafter referred to as the Act) prohibits the manufacture,
storage, distribution, transportation, possession, sale, purchase
and consumption of any intoxicant or liquor, unless so allowed
in terms of the Act. (Section 13).
In addition to the penalty imposed for committing
such an offence, Section 56 of the Act lays down the procedure
for confiscation of “things” used for in the commission of such
an offence. The said Section reads as under:
“56. Things        liable for confiscation.-
Patna High Court CWJC No.9247 of 2021 dt.01-07-2021
Whenever an offence has been committed, which
is punishable under this Act, following things
shall be liable to confiscation, namely-
(a) Any intoxicant, liquor, material, still, utensil,
implement, apparatus in respect of or by means
of which such offence has been committed;
(b) any intoxicant or liquor unlawfully imported,
transported, manufactured, sold or brought
along with or in addition to, any intoxicant,
liable to confiscation under clause (a);
(c) any receptacle, package, or covering in
which anything liable to confiscation under
clause (a) or clause (b), is found, and the other
contents, if any, of such receptacle, package or
(d) any animal, vehicle, vessel or other
conveyance used for carrying the same.
(e) Any premises or part thereof that may have
been used for storing or manufacturing any
liquor or intoxicant or for committing any other
offence under this Act.
Explanation.- The word “premises” include
the immovable structure, all moveable items within
the structure and the land on which the premises is
situated.”
Under section 58 power to issue an order of
confiscation vests with the District Collector/Authorized
officer, who upon receipt of the report of the seizing officer
Patna High Court CWJC No.9247 of 2021 dt.01-07-2021
detaining such property (“things”) is required to pass an order.
This Court has been flooded with several petitions
solely on account of non-initiation of such proceedings of
confiscation or passing of illegal orders with respect thereto.
Also, on account of lack of parties pursing the remedies so
provided under the Act.
Consequently, the court was faced with the
following fact situations:- (a) where despite seizure, no
proceedings for confiscation under Section 58 were initiated;
(ii) where such proceedings were initiated but not concluded
within a reasonable time; (c) the parties after obtaining interim
relief for release of “things” under orders passed in different set
of writ petitions, did not participate in the confiscatory
proceedings; (d) where the order of confiscation was neither
communicated nor the parties made aware of such fact, thus
precluding them from filing appeal under Section 92 and
Revision under Section 93 of the Act; (e) proceedings initiated
under Section 92/93 were not concluded within a reasonable
time either on account of inaction on the part of the authority(s)
or on account of non-cooperation of the private parties, be it for
whatever reason.
Resultantly, this Court from time to time has been
Patna High Court CWJC No.9247 of 2021 dt.01-07-2021
passing several orders.
In CWJC No.3245 of 2017 titled as Manish
Kumar Chaudhary versus the State of Bihar & Ors., this
Court vide order dated 18.01.20202 issued following
“As such, as mutually prayed for, the
present writ petition is being disposed of on the
following mutually agreed terms:-
(a) Interim order dated 07.03.2017 passed in the
instant writ petition, directing release of the
property (vehicle/land/house/shop etc.) shall
continue to remain in operation till such
time proceedings up to the stage of initiation
of confiscatory proceedings and its
culmination as also filing and culmination of
the proceedings in the appeal, as the case
may be. This, however, would be subject to
the petitioner(s) fully cooperating and not
transferring/alienating the property to any
person or creating third party rights. It goes
without saying that the property shall be
maintained and retained in its original
condition and not destroyed in any manner
or its character changed.
(b) Wherever proceedings for confiscation have
not started, the Appropriate Authority
constituted under the Act, shall positively
initiate the same within a period of four
weeks from today. In any event, petitioner
undertakes to appear in the office of the
concerned          appropriate    authority/the
concerned District Magistrate, on the 10th
of February, 2020 and apprise him of the
passing of the order. The said Officer shall
forthwith, and not later than four weeks
from today, initiate the proceedings and after
compliance of principles of natural justice,
take a decision thereupon within a period of
Patna High Court CWJC No.9247 of 2021 dt.01-07-2021
two months.
(c)     In the event of the authority arriving at the
conclusion, directing confiscation of the
property, the petitioner shall positively file
the appeal within the statutory period as
envisaged under Section 92 of the Bihar
Prohibition and Excise Act, 2016 and the
appellate authority shall positively decide
the same within a period of two months
thereafter.
(d)  Wherever confiscatory proceedings already
stand concluded and if the petitioner so
desires, within four weeks from today or
within the statutory period of limitation, as
the case may be, positively file an appeal,
which shall be adjudicated on its own merit.
The issue of limitation shall not be raised by
the State or come in the petitioner’s way of
decision on merits. The said proceedings
shall positively be concluded within a period
of two months from the date of filing.
(e)    Petitioner undertakes to fully cooperate in all
such proceedings (confiscatory, Appeal, etc.)
and shall not take any unnecessary
adjournment.
(f)    Where appeal already stands filed, petitioner
shall appear before the said Authority on the
20th February, 2020 and apprise him of the
passing of the order. The Appellate
Authority shall positively decide the same
within a period of two months thereafter.
(g)      With the decision in the appeal, it shall be
open for either of the parties to take recourse
to such remedies as are available in
accordance with law, including approaching
this Court, on the same and subsequent
cause of action.
(h)    If the petitioner fails to cooperate, does not
procrastination, in any one of the
proceedings referred to supra, it shall be
open for the authority to take a decision with
regard to the property (vehicle/house/land
etc.), including taking back possession and
Patna High Court CWJC No.9247 of 2021 dt.01-07-2021
putting it on sale in terms of the Act, with
the interim order deemed to have been
vacated.
(i)      If the appellant chooses not to prefer an
appeal within the said statutory period or as
directed herein, it shall be open for the
authority to take a decision with regard to
the property, including taking back
possession and putting it on sale in terms of
the Act and the interim order passed in the
instant petition shall be deemed to have
been vacated.
(j)        With the outcome of the Special Leave
Petition (C) No.29749 of 2016, titled as
State of Bihar & Ors. etc. Vs. Confederation
of Indian Alcoholic Beverage Companies &
Anr., parties, including the petitioner would
be at liberty to take recourse to such
remedies as are permissible in law.”
In CWJC No.20598 of 2019 titled as Md.
Shaukat Ali Vs. The State of Bihar & Ors. this Court vide
order dated 09.01.2020 issued the following directions: -
“Without adjudicating the petitioner’s petition
on merits, we are of the considered view that interest of
justice would be best met, if the petition is disposed of in
(a)      Since the vehicle in question stands
seized in relation to the FIR which stood registered
long ago, in case confiscation proceeding has not been
initiated, it must be initiated within a period of 15 days
from today and that confiscation proceeding stands
initiated, we direct the appropriate authority under the
Act to forthwith ensure that such proceedings be
concluded not later than 30 days.
(b)      The petitioner undertakes to make
himself available in the office of the concerned
appropriate authority empowered under Section 58 of
the Act i.e. District Collector, in his/her office on
24.01.2020 at 10:30 A.M.
(c)        We further direct the appropriate
authority to positively conclude the confiscation
Patna High Court CWJC No.9247 of 2021 dt.01-07-2021
proceeding within next thirty days on appearance of
the petitioner. If for whatever reason, such proceeding
cannot be concluded, in that event it shall be open for
the authority to take such measures, as are permissible
in law, for release of the vehicle in question by way of
interim measure, on such terms as may be deemed
appropriate, considering the attending facts and
circumstances of the case.
(d) If eventually, the appropriate authority
arrives at a conclusion that the property is not liable to
be confiscated, it shall be open for the petitioner to
seek damages in accordance with law and have
appropriate proceedings initiated against the erring
officials/officers.
Learned counsel for the petitioner states that
the certified copy of the order shall be made available to
the concerned District Collector on the date so fixed.
For future guidance, where parties have not
approached this Court, we issue the following direction:-
The expression “reasonable delay” used in
Section 58 of Chapter VI of the Act, in our considered
view, necessarily has to be within a reasonable time
and with dispatch, which period, in our considered
view, three months time is sufficient enough for any
authority to adjudicate any issue, more so, when we
are dealing with confiscatory proceedings.”
These directions were reiterated in CWJC
No.17165 of 2019 titled as Umesh Sah Versus The State of
Bihar & Ors. by this Court vide order dated 14.01.2020.
Since the respondents had failed to comply with
the several orders passed by this court, in CWJC No.2050 of
2020 titled as Bunilal Sah @ Munilal Sah versus the State of
Bihar & Ors. vide order dated 29.01.2020 by recording the
entire history, directed the State to file an affidavit as to why
proceedings for contempt be not initiated. Such order dated
Patna High Court CWJC No.9247 of 2021 dt.01-07-2021
29.01.2020 in toto reads as under:-
“It is seen that despite our order dated 9thof
January, 2020, passed in C.W.J.C. No. 20598 of 2019,
titled as Md. Shaukat Ali Vs. The State of Bihar& Ors.,
and the order dated 14thof January, 2020 passed in
C.W.J.C. No. 17165 of 2019, titled as Umesh Sah Vs. The
State of Bihar& Ors., the State has not initiated
proceedings under the provisions of the Bihar Prohibition
and Excise Act, 2016. It is a matter of record that this
legislation has generated huge litigation. The docket of
the Court, be it the trial court or the High Court, is now
choked solely on account of such legislation. In the High
Court itself, on an average, 400 bail applications are
being filed every day, some of which are pertaining to the
said Statute. Position in the lower courts is worse. Before
the trial courts, i.e. the Sessions Courts, more than
1,75,000 challans stand filed in relation to the said
Statute. Before this Court, on an average, more than 5000
writ petitions are being filed annually for release of
vehicles/properties seized under the said Act. It has been
the continued practice of this Court, since the year 2017,
that in the writ petitions the vehicles, unless the situation
so warrants, are normally being released subject to
fulfilment of certain conditions. This, perhaps, is done
only to protect the property from being destroyed, for
there is no mechanism under the Statute or with the
administration for protecting the property seized in
relation to the crime registered under the said Statute.
Property is left to the vagaries of weather, resulting into
national loss. This we say for the reason that proceedings
for confiscation, as envisaged under Section 58, were
never initiated by the authority, which under the Act is the
District Magistrate/Collector. It is only as a result of
inaction on the part of such authorities that the owners of
the vehicles/properties are constrained to approach this
Court for its release. When the matter in C.W.J.C. No.
20598 of 2019 (Md. Shaukat Ali Vs. The State of Bihar&
Ors.) and in 17165 of 2019(Umesh Sah Vs. The State of
Bihar& Ors.) (supra) was taken up for hearing, the State
vehemently opposed the release of the vehicle and, as
such, the following orders were passed:
(in C.W.J.C. No.20598 of 2019, order dated 9.1.2020)
“The petition filed on 01.10.2019 is listed for
hearing for the first time today before the Court.

With the consent of the learned counsel for the
parties, the writ petition stands disposed of in the
following terms.
The petitioner prays for provisional release of
Tata Indigo white vehicle bearing Registration No. BR
01CX 1796 which has been seized in connection with
Kotwali P. S. Case No. 721 of 2019, for the offences
punishable under Sections 427/279 of the Indian Penal
Code and Section 37(b)(c) of the Bihar Prohibition and
It is continued practice of this Court that in
cases of drunken driving; no recovery from the vehicle;
recovery of less than commercial quantity; where ex-
facie, vehicle is not liable to be confiscated; where there
is inordinate delay in initiating proceedings for
confiscation of the vehicle etc., this Court has been
directing      the      State   to    provisionally  release

proceedings, as the case may be. Reference can be made

In fact, in CWJC No. 5049 of 2018 titled as
Diwakar Kumar Singh Versus the State of Bihar & Ors.
the Court issued the following directions:-
proceedings, the confiscating authority shall take note
of the provisions of Section 56 of the Bihar
Prohibition and Excise Act, 2016 and record a positive
finding after hearing the petitioner as to whether when
the petitioner is found or the vehicle is found to be
used by a person in drunken condition and no liquor is
seized from the vehicle or when the vehicle is not used
for transportation of liquor, whether the provision of
Section 56 of the Act will apply. It shall be mandatory
for the confiscating authority to decide this issue
before passing any order on the confiscation
proceedings. The confiscating authority shall consider
the provision of Section 56 of the Act, apply his mind
and pass a speaking order with regard to confiscation
initiated. Without deciding the aforesaid issue as a
preliminary issue, further proceedings in the
confiscation proceedings shall be prohibited.
We further request the office of the
Patna High Court CWJC No.9247 of 2021 dt.01-07-2021
Advocate General to communicate this order to all the
District Magistrates in the State of Bihar, who would
be mandated to pass an appropriate order in such cases
where the vehicle has been confiscated under Section
56 of the Act only on the allegation that the vehicle
was being driven in a drunken condition and no liquor
was seized from the vehicle nor the vehicle used for
transportation or carriage of liquor. The issue shall be
decided by each and every District Magistrate before
proceeding in the confiscation proceedings where the
allegation is about the vehicle being driven in a
drunken condition and no liquor was found from the
possession of the vehicle.
It shall be the duty of the Advocate General
to communicate this order to each and every District
Magistrate and inform the Registrar General of this
Court. In spite thereof, if we find that the District
Magistrates are passing confiscation order without
addressing this issue first, we may consider initiating
contempt proceedings against the concerned District
It is further seen that in CWJC No.15003 of 2019
titled as Shobha Devi Versus The State of Bihar & Ors. the
“6. On examination of aforesaid fact,
particularly allegation of the petitioner that in a court
proceeding before the learned Special Judge, Excise, a
false information was given, we are of the opinion that
the court of learned Special Judge, Excise would be
competent court to pass an appropriate order, in view
of provisions contained in Section 340 of the Code of
7. Accordingly, the petitioner is granted
liberty to file appropriate petition before the learned
Special Judge, Excise for prosecuting the concerned
police official.
8. So far as claim of compensation is
concerned, obviously on going through the material on
record, since there was no recovery of liquor from the
vehicle and it was a case, in which, the occupants of
the vehicle were alleged to be in drunken condition
and were creating nuisance, though were liable to be
arrested. In any event, the vehicle was not required to
be seized, since it was not liable to be confiscated.
9. In such situation, we are of the opinion
that it is a fit case, in which, we may direct to pay
adequate compensation to the petitioner, being owner
Patna High Court CWJC No.9247 of 2021 dt.01-07-2021
of the vehicle, to the tune of Rs.75,000/- (seventy five
thousand), however, Sri Kumar Manish, learned
Standing Counsel – 5 requests for granting an
opportunity for obtaining detailed instruction and
filing counter affidavit in the matter. The request of Sri
Kumar Manish, S.C.-5 is allowed for filing counter
affidavit so that final order may be passed.
10. It goes without saying that before filing
counter affidavit, the respondent no. 4/Superintendent
of Police, Darbhanga may conduct a preliminary
inquiry regarding the conduct of the police officer,
who had seized the vehicle of the petitioner and state
all those facts in its counter affidavit, which must be
filed by 29th of November, 2019. The affidavit must
be sworn by the Superintendent of Police himself.
11. It further goes without saying that if
after considering all the facts, including counter
affidavit, which is proposed to be filed, the Court
comes to the conclusion that the petitioner is entitled
for claim of amount of compensation, which has been
referred hereinabove, the said compensation amount
must be recovered from the pocket of the police
officer, who was responsible for such illegal seizure.”
Despite the same, only before this Court, when
matters of similar nature came up for hearing on 16thof
December, 2019, the learned Advocate General assisted
by Shri Vikash Kumar, learned Standing Counsel-11, and
Shri Vivek Prasad, learned Government Pleader-7,
vehemently opposed the petitions for release of the
vehicles. Consequently, the writ petitions were disposed
of with the directions to the appropriate authorities to
positively initiate/conclude confiscatory proceedings
within a period of 30-45 days.
Without adjudicating the petitioner’s petition
on merits, we are of the considered view that interest of
justice would be best met, if the petition is disposed of in
(a)      Since the vehicle in question stands
seized in relation to the FIR which stood registered

initiated, it must be initiated within a period of 15 days
from today and that confiscation proceeding stands

himself available in the office of the concerned
Patna High Court CWJC No.9247 of 2021 dt.01-07-2021
appropriate authority empowered under Section 58 of
the Act i.e. District Collector, in his/her office on
24.01.2020 at 10:30 A.M.
(c)        We further direct the appropriate
authority to positively conclude the confiscation
proceeding within next thirty days on appearance of
the petitioner. If for whatever reason, such proceeding
cannot be concluded, in that event it shall be open for

proceedings and wherever parties are aggrieved, it
shall be open to them to initiate appropriate
proceeding before the appellate authority.

passed in CWJC No.2380 of 2019 titled as Avinash
Kumar Versus the State of Bihar & Ors.;
(xv) judgement dated 29.01.2019 passed
in CWJC No.1648 of 2019 titled as Roshan Kumar
Versus The State of Bihar & Ors.; and
(xvi) judgement dated 22.01.2019 passed
in CWJC No.1314 of 2019 titled as Shanti Devi
Versus The State of Bihar & Ors.
In fact, in CWJC No. 5049 of 2018 titled as
Diwakar Kumar Singh Versus the State of Bihar & Ors.
the Court issued the following directions:-
proceedings, the confiscating authority shall take note
of the provisions of Section 56 of the Bihar
Prohibition and Excise Act, 2016 and record a positive
finding after hearing the petitioner as to whether when
the petitioner is found or the vehicle is found to be
used by a person in drunken condition and no liquor is
seized from the vehicle or when the vehicle is not used
for transportation of liquor, whether the provision of
Section 56 of the Act will apply. It shall be mandatory
for the confiscating authority to decide this issue
before passing any order on the confiscation
proceedings. The confiscating authority shall consider
the provision of Section 56 of the Act, apply his mind
and pass a speaking order with regard to confiscation
initiated. Without deciding the aforesaid issue as a
Patna High Court CWJC No.9247 of 2021 dt.01-07-2021
preliminary issue, further proceedings in the
confiscation proceedings shall be prohibited.
We further request the office of the
Advocate General to communicate this order to all the
District Magistrates in the State of Bihar, who would
be mandated to pass an appropriate order in such cases
where the vehicle has been confiscated under Section
56 of the Act only on the allegation that the vehicle
was being driven in a drunken condition and no liquor
was seized from the vehicle nor the vehicle used for
transportation or carriage of liquor. The issue shall be
decided by each and every District Magistrate before
proceeding in the confiscation proceedings where the
allegation is about the vehicle being driven in a
drunken condition and no liquor was found from the
possession of the vehicle.
It shall be the duty of the Advocate General
to communicate this order to each and every District
Magistrate and inform the Registrar General of this
Court. In spite thereof, if we find that the District
Magistrates are passing confiscation order without
addressing this issue first, we may consider initiating
contempt proceedings against the concerned District
It is further seen that in CWJC No.15003 of 2019
titled as Shobha Devi Versus The State of Bihar & Ors.the
“6. On examination of aforesaid fact,
particularly allegation of the petitioner that in a court
proceeding before the learned Special Judge, Excise, a
false information was given, we are of the opinion that
the court of learned Special Judge, Excise would be
competent court to pass an appropriate order, in view
of provisions contained in Section 340 of the Code of
7. Accordingly, the petitioner is granted
liberty to file appropriate petition before the learned
Special Judge, Excise for prosecuting the concerned
police official.
8. So far as claim of compensation is
concerned, obviously on going through the material on
record, since there was no recovery of liquor from the
vehicle and it was a case, in which, the occupants of
the vehicle were alleged to be in drunken condition
and were creating nuisance, though were liable to be
arrested. In any event, the vehicle was not required to
be seized, since it was not liable to be confiscated.
Patna High Court CWJC No.9247 of 2021 dt.01-07-2021
9. In such situation, we are of the opinion
that it is a fit case, in which, we may direct to pay
adequate compensation to the petitioner, being owner
of the vehicle, to the tune of Rs.75,000/- (seventy five
thousand), however, Sri Kumar Manish, learned
Standing Counsel – 5 requests for granting an
opportunity for obtaining detailed instruction and
filing counter affidavit in the matter. The request of Sri
Kumar Manish, S.C.-5 is allowed for filing counter
affidavit so that final order may be passed.
10. It goes without saying that before filing
counter affidavit, the respondent no. 4/Superintendent
of Police, Darbhanga may conduct a preliminary
inquiry regarding the conduct of the police officer,
who had seized the vehicle of the petitioner and state
all those facts in its counter affidavit, which must be
filed by 29th of November, 2019. The affidavit must
be sworn by the Superintendent of Police himself.
11. It further goes without saying that if
after considering all the facts, including counter
affidavit, which is proposed to be filed, the Court
comes to the conclusion that the petitioner is entitled
for claim of amount of compensation, which has been
referred hereinabove, the said compensation amount
must be recovered from the pocket of the police
officer, who was responsible for such illegal seizure.”
Despite the same, only before this Court,
when matters of similar nature came up for hearing on
16thof December, 2019, the learned Advocate General
assisted by Shri Vikash Kumar, learned Standing
Counsel-11, and Shri Vivek Prasad, learned
Government Pleader-7, vehemently opposed the
petitions for release of the vehicles. Consequently, the
writ petitions were disposed of with the directions to
the       appropriate       authorities   to     positively
initiate/conclude confiscatory proceedings within a
period of 30-45 days.
Without adjudicating the petitioner’s
petition on merits, we are of the considered view that
interest of justice would be best met, if the petition is
disposed of in the following terms:-
(a)      Since the vehicle in question stands
seized in relation to the FIR which stood registered
long ago, in case confiscation proceeding has not been
initiated, it must be initiated within a period of 15 days
from today and that confiscation proceeding stands
initiated, we direct the appropriate authority under the
Patna High Court CWJC No.9247 of 2021 dt.01-07-2021
Act to forthwith ensure that such proceedings be
concluded not later than 30 days.
(b)      The petitioner undertakes to make
himself available in the office of the concerned
appropriate authority empowered under Section 58 of
the Act i.e. District Collector, in his/her office on
04.02.2020 at 10:30 A.M.
(c)        We further direct the appropriate
authority to positively conclude the confiscation
proceeding within next thirty days on appearance of
the petitioner. If for whatever reason, such proceeding
cannot be concluded, in that event it shall be open for
the authority to take such measures, as are permissible
in law, for release of the vehicle in question by way of
interim measure, on such terms as may be deemed
appropriate, considering the attending facts and
circumstances of the case.
(d) If eventually, the appropriate authority
arrives at a conclusion that the property is not liable to
be confiscated, it shall be open for the petitioner to
seek damages in accordance with law and have
appropriate proceedings initiated against the erring
officials/officers.
Learned counsel for the petitioner states that
the certified copy of the order shall be made available to
the concerned District Collector on the date so fixed.
For future guidance, where parties have not
approached this Court, we issue the following direction:-
The expression “reasonable delay” used in
Section 58 of Chapter VI of the Act, in our considered
view, necessarily has to be within a reasonable time and
with dispatch, which period, in our considered view, three
months time is sufficient enough for any authority to
adjudicate any issue, more so, when we are dealing with
confiscatory proceedings.
We clarify that we have not adjudicated the
writ petition on merits and it shall be open for the parties
to take all stand in the adjudicatory proceedings and
wherever parties are aggrieved, it shall be open to them to
initiate appropriate proceeding before the appellate
authority.
Learned counsel for the State also undertakes
to communicate the order to the concerned appropriate
authority i.e. District Magistrate, empowered under
Section 58 of the Act.”
In Umesh Sah (supra), this Court had clarified
Patna High Court CWJC No.9247 of 2021 dt.01-07-2021
that the expression “reasonable delay” under Section 58
of Chapter 6 of the Act has to be construed to be ‘not
more than three months’.
It is seen that despite our observations, the
appropriate authorities have not taken any action in
initiating the proceedings for confiscation of the property
under the Act. The litigants are, thus, forced to approach
this Court by way of filing separate petitions.
Thus, today we are left with two options;
either to initiate proceedings for contempt under the
provisions of Contempt of Courts Act or under Article
215 of the Constitution of India or ask the Chief
Secretary, Government of Bihar, to evolve a mechanism,
self serving in nature, so as to ensure that the provisions
of the Act are implemented in letter and spirit,
expeditiously, without any delay and with reasonable
dispatch.
Why is it that the owners of the property are
forced to approach this Court for release of the vehicles
or property? Is it that there is no mechanism under the
Act for initiating confiscatory proceedings at the earliest?
Is it that there is insufficient infrastructure with the State
Government for ensuring implementation of the
Illustratively, in the weekly list dated
27.1.2020, we notice that more than 75 cases stand filed
and listed despite our order dated 9 thof January, 2020. In
the instant case, seizure is of the year 2019 and no
proceedings of confiscation have commenced.
We are of the considered view that non-
implementation of the Act is generally having a very
serious adverse consequence on the dispensation of
administration of justice. And, peculiarly, it is only when
the matter was taken up by the Bench hearing the petition
bearing C.W.J.C. No. 25266 of 2019 (Vikki Kumar Vs.
The State of Bihar& Ors.) on 17.12.2019that the State
vehemently opposed release of the vehicle, contrary to
the practice adopted hitherto before.
Be that as it may, at this point in time, we
refrain from passing any order under the contempt
jurisdiction, but direct the Chief Secretary, Government
of Bihar, to file his personal affidavit dealing with each
one of the issues highlighted (supra) as also elaborately
indicating the mechanism which the State has or desires
to evolve so as to prevent the litigants from directly
approaching the Court for release of the vehicle and also
ensuring early completion of the proceedings, be it
confiscatory in nature or in an appellate jurisdiction,
Patna High Court CWJC No.9247 of 2021 dt.01-07-2021
under the provisions of the Bihar Prohibition and Excise
Let an affidavit in that regard be positively
filed within one week.
List this case on 6.2.2020.”
Further this very Bench in CWJC No.6148 of 2020,
titled as Vishal Kumar Versus the State of Bihar & Anr on
04.06.2020 issued the following directions: -
“In the aforesaid decisions, we have already
laid down the time-schedule within which all
proceedings are necessarily required to be
concluded and the outer limit is three months from
the date on which this Court has directed the party
to make himself available before the appropriate
authority.
We clarify that petitioner undertakes to fully
cooperate in the proceedings and we further clarify
that in case the authorities are not able to conclude
the proceedings within the time bound period, the
vehicle/property shall be allowed to be released on
such conditions as the appropriate authority may
deem fit and proper.
As such, petition is disposed of making the
directions contained in the orders referred to supra,
applicable mutatis mutandis, insofar as applicable
and possible, to the petitioner’s case.”
Learned counsel states that petition be disposed of
in terms of the various orders passed by this Court, more so the
orders referred to supra.
It is seen that till date, in large number of cases,
position about conclusion of the proceedings, be it under
Section 58, 92 or 93 remains the same.
We further direct that all proceedings under
Patna High Court CWJC No.9247 of 2021 dt.01-07-2021
Section 58 must positively be initiated/concluded within a
period of ninety days from the date of appearance of the parties.
Further, Appeal/Revision, if any, be also decided within a
period of thirty days from the date of initiation, failing which
the “things” (vehicle/property/ etc.) shall be deemed to have
been released in terms of several orders passed by this Court,
reference whereof stands mentioned in Bunilal Sah @ Munilal
Wherever         confiscatory proceedings stand
concluded and parties could not file the appeal/revision within
the statutory period of limitation, as already stands directed in
several matters, if they were to initiate such proceedings within
next thirty days, the plea of limitation would not come in their
way of adjudication of such proceedings on merit.
Petitioner through learned counsel undertakes to
make himself available on 15.07.2021 at 10:30 A.M. before the
appropriate authority which may be in the attending facts, the
Collector of the Gopalganj District/Appellate or the Revisional
Authority. If the Collector is not himself dealing with the matter
on account of delegation of power or assignment of work to
another officer of his District, he shall fix a date directing the
parties to appear before the said officer, which date shall be not
Patna High Court CWJC No.9247 of 2021 dt.01-07-2021
exceeding one week. Also, he shall inform the said authority of
fixing of such date. We clarify that convenience of parties,
specially during the time of Pandemic Covid-19 is of prime
importance and it shall be open for the authority to hear the
parties with the use of technology, i.e. Video Conferencing
facility etc.
Learned counsel for the State undertakes to
communicate the order to all concerned, including the District
Magistrate and no certified copy of the order shall be required
to be placed on the file of proceedings pending or initiated
under the Act, for such order is available on the official website
of the High Court & can be downloaded and/or verified from
there, in the times of current Pandemic Covid-19.
We only hope and expect that the Authorities under
the Act shall take appropriate action at the earliest and in
accordance with law, within the time schedule fixed, failing
which the vehicle/property/things liable for confiscation shall
be deemed to have been released without any further reference
to this Court.
Liberty reserved to the petitioner to take recourse
to such remedies as are otherwise available in accordance with
law if the need so arises subsequently.
Patna High Court CWJC No.9247 of 2021 dt.01-07-2021
Petition stands disposed of with the aforesaid
observations/directions.
