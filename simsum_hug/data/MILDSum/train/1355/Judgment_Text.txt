:Mr. Manoj Chauhan and Mr. Varun
rt              Chandel, Additional Advocate
Petitioner is an accused in case FIR No.
ig  h14/2021,       dated      27.03.2021,           registered         under
Sections 20           and 29 of Narcotic Drugs and
Psychotropic Substances, Act (for short ‘ND&PS’
H    Act), at Police Station            Sainj, District Kullu, H.P.
Petitioner is in custody since 30.03.2021.
1     Whether reporters of the local papers may be allowed to see the judgment?
2.          Petitioner is facing trial for offences
under Sections 20         and 29 of ND&PS Act in
pursuance     to challan filed by respondent. The
allegation against petitioner is that on 27.03.2021,
police party headed by HC Anupam Kumar No. 13
had laid ‘Naka ‘at place Larji. At about 4:30 am, a
for      checking.
vehicle bearing No. HP-24B-6994 (Tata Tigor) was
stopped                             Another            Vehicle
HP-24C-6968       (Pick   Up)   followed    and
behind the Tata Tigor car. Two person alighted from
vehicle bearing No. HP-24B-6994 and ran towards
river. Vehicle H.P. 24-C-6968 ( Pick Up) was
occupied by its driver Vinod Kumar. On search of
vehicle H.P-24C-6968 “Charas” weighing 1 Kg and
555 grams was recovered. Petitioner is alleged to be
ig  one of the occupants of vehicle No. HP-24B-6994,
H   who has fled from the scene. It is alleged against
him that contraband belonged to petitioner and
other occupant of vehicle No. HP-24B-6968.
3.          Petitioner has now prayed for grant of
bail on the ground that his constitutional right of
expeditious disposal of trial has been infringed. As
per petitioner, he is in custody approximately since
one year and ten months now and the trial has not
concluded, rather, it is progressing at snails pace. .
4.          In its status report,     respondent           has
submitted that prosecution witnesses have now
been summoned for 17.01.2023 for examination
before learned District and Sessions Judge.
Learned Additional Advocate General has
opposed the prayer of the petitioner, on the ground
that Section 37 of ND&PS Act, has application in
the facts of the case and merely, on the ground of
delay in conclusion of trial, petitioner cannot be
released on bail.
6.        I have heard learned counsel for the
ig  petitioner as well as learned Additional Advocate
H   General and have also gone through the status
report.
7.         The fetters placed by Section 37 of
ND&PS Act, evidently have been instrumental in
denial of right     of bail to the petitioner in the
instant case till date. The question that arises for
consideration is, can the provisions of Section 37
of the Act, be construed         to have same efficacy,
throughout the pendency of trial, notwithstanding,
the period of     custody of the accused, especially,
when it is weighed against his fundamental right
to have expeditious disposal of trial?
It is submitted by learned counsel for
the petitioner that till date prosecution witnesses
have not been examined, despite the fact that
petitioner is    in custody since 30.03.2021. In the
considered view of this Court, the Constitutional
guarantee of expeditious      trial cannot be          diluted
by applying the rigors of Section 37 of ND&PS Act
in perpetuity.
ig  9.         Recently,     in   a    number         of    cases,
H   under-trials      for offences involving commercial
quantity of contraband under ND&PS Act have
been allowed       the liberty     of bail      by Hon’ble
Supreme Court only on the ground that they have
been incarcerated for prolonged durations.
Supreme Court has held as under:-
“6.What persuades us to pass an order in favour of
the appellant is the fact that despite the rigors
of Section 37 of the said Act, in the present case
though charge sheet was filed on 23.09.2018 even
the charges have not been framed nor trial has
commenced.”
State of West Bengal (Special Leave to Appeal
(Cr.L.) No (s). 5769 of 2022, decided on 01.08.2022,
Hon’ble Supreme Court has held as under:-
“During the course of the hearing, we are informed
C   that the petitioner has undergone custody for a
period    of   01   year    and    07    months     as    on
09.06.2022. The trial is at a preliminary stage, as
ig  h         only     one   witness     has    been   examined.
petitioner does not have any criminal antecedents.
Taking into consideration the period of sentence
H              undergone by the petitioner and all the attending
circumstances but without expressing any views
in the merits of the case, we are inclined to grant
bail to the petitioner.”
Vs. Union of India (Cr. Appeal No. 1169 of 2022),
decided on 05.08.2022,Hon’ble Supreme Court has
held as under:-
“ The appellant is in custody since 18.06.2020 in
connection with crime registered as NCB Crime No.
02/2020 in respect of offences punishable under
Sections 8,20,27-AA, 28 read with 29 of the
Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act,
The application seeking relief of bail having been
rejected, the instant appeal has been filed.
We have heard Mr. Ashok Kumar Panda, learned
Senior Advocate in support of the appeal and Mr.
Sanjay Jain, learned Additional Solicitor General
for the respondent.
Considering the fact and circumstances on record
and the length of custody undergone by the
appellant, in our view the case for bail is made
out.”
State of West Bengal, (Criminal Appeal No.(s) 245
of 2020, decided on 07.02.2020, it has been held as
“The appellant was arrested on 21.07.2018 and
continues to be custody. It appears that out of 10
witnesses cited to be examined in support of the
H              case of prosecution four witnesses have already
been examined in the trial.
Without expressing any opinion on the merits or
demerits of the rival submissions and considering
the facts and circumstances on record, in our
view, case for bail is made out.”
Territory of Jammu and Kashmir( Special Leave
to Appeal (Cr.L.) No. 3961 of 2022, decided on
01.08.2022, it has been held as under:-
reported to be
“Having regard to the fact that the petitioner
in jail since 1-3-2020 and has
suffered incarceration for over 2 years and
months and there being no likelihood of completion
of trial in the near future, which fact cannot be
controverted by the learned counsel appearing for
bail.”.
the UT, we are inclined to enlarge the petitioner on
different        Co-ordinate
Benches of this Court have also followed precedent
to grant bail to the accused in ND&PS Act, on the
ground    of     prolonged       pre-trial     incarceration.
Reference can be made to order dated 28.07.2022,
passed in Cr.MP(M) No. 1255 of 2022, order dated
01.12.2022, passed in Cr.MP(M) No. 2271 of 2022
and order dated 04.11.2022, passed in Cr.MP(M)
No. 2273 of 2022.
H   16.        Reverting       to the facts of the case, the
petitioner is in custody since 30.03.2021 and the
facts suggest that the trial is not likely to be
concluded in near future. There is nothing on
record to suggest that the                   delay in         trial is
attributable to the petitioner.
17.            Keeping in view the facts of the case and
also the above noted precedents, the bail petition is
allowed and petitioner is ordered to be released on
bail in case FIR No. 14/2021, dated 27.03.2021,
registered under Sections 20 and 29 of ND&PS Act,

furnishing personal bond in the sum of Rs.
1,00,000/- with one surety in the like amount to
the satisfaction of learned trial court. This order
shall,       however,     be    subject      to    the      following
conditions:-
ig  h     i)       Petitioner shall regularly attend the trial of
the case before learned Trial Court and shall

event     of     petitioner    violating     the
