1.      The nine petitioners in the above captioned first petition [W.P.(C)
11083/2019] are group Officers in Grade-A in the Border Security Force
(‘BSF’) and are holding posts in the rank of Assistant Commandant,
Deputy Commandant and Second-in-Command.
W.P.(C) 11083/2019 & W.P.(C) 3370/2020                                   Page 1 of 12
2.      It is averred in the petition [W.P.(C) 11083/2019] that BSF is
entrusted with the responsibility to guard the Borders of the Indian
Territory, sensitive LWE areas, North East and other parts to maintain law
and order and for this, a large of the force is deployed in far flung
locations where there is no proper infrastructure or accommodation for the
families. Despite construction of the family accommodations, petitioners
and other similarly situated officers are still not provided with the
Government accommodation at the place where they are posted or the
locations where the separated family accommodations have been
constructed. The petitioners and similarly situated personnel, therefore,
face problems in keeping their families at the place of their postings;
especially at the border or difficult areas where there is lack of basic
education and medical facilities.
3.       According to petitioners, in the year 1999 the Government of India
had approved construction of separate family accommodations with the
purpose that if the Officer is not getting accommodation at the place of his
posting, he shall be entitled to a separate family accommodation, at
various locations where the BSF has constructed houses, by paying 10%
of the standard rent. Further, despite the aforesaid position, the petitioners
and other similarly situated persons are not provided Government
Accommodation nor they are being paid House Rent Allowance for
keeping their families at different locations. However, based upon the
representations of the petitioners and similarly situated persons, the
competent authority under the Seventh Pay Commission recommended
that the personnel of the uniformed services can keep their families at any
W.P.(C) 11083/2019 & W.P.(C) 3370/2020                            Page 2 of 12
location and they would be paid HRA for the same. However, the
aforesaid recommendations were confined to the Personnel Below Officer
Rank (‘PBOR’) but denied to the Group-A officers. Thereafter,
respondents issued the OM order dated 31.07.2017.
4.      Aggrieved against the aforesaid order dated 31.07.2017, petitioners
preferred a Representation dated 07.11.2017 praying for grant of similar
benefit as has been granted to the PBORs, which was forwarded to the
Ministry of Home Affairs for consideration. However, vide Signal dated
15.03.2018 the same was rejected by the MHA. Vide this petition,
petitioners have challenged the aforesaid OM dated 31.07.2017 as well as
Signal dated 15.03.2018 passed by the MHA; to the extent it is confined
to the PBORs with the prayer to include petitioners and similarly situated
personnel for grant of HRA.
5.      The nine petitioners in the above captioned second petition
[W.P.(C) 3370/2020] are also Group-A Officers, holding the rank of
Assistant Commandant in Central Reserve Police Force (‘CRPF’).
Petitioners have averred that under the service conditions and entitlement
and by virtue of Guidelines dated 30.11.2015, petitioners are entitled to
allotment of Government accommodation in their particular office based
upon their entitlement. Since the number of officers entitled for
Government accommodation is higher than the accommodation available
in the location, the respondents grant outliving permission with HRA to
the officers after obtaining a No Accommodation Certificate (‘NAC’)
from the Directorate of Estate. The petitioners have averred that not
everyone in the unit is entitled to get NAC and only the HRA of the
W.P.(C) 11083/2019 & W.P.(C) 3370/2020                         Page 3 of 12
location, where group centre is located, is provided if one has the rented
accommodation and rent agreement. As large numbers of personnel are
not in a position to keep their families in their group centre due to social
and language problem, many of them keep their families in different
places other than their group centre where good medical and education
facilities are available. However, according to petitioners, they are not
being paid HRA for keeping their families at different locations. A
proposal was, therefore, made to the Competent Authority to permit the
petitioners and similarly situated personnel to keep their families at any
location and be paid HRA for the same. According to petitioners, the
Competent Authority under the Seventh Pay Commission accepted the
aforesaid proposal in respect of PBOR but denied the same to Group- A
Officers like the petitioners. Thereafter, respondents issued OM dated
07.07.2017 and also order dated 31.07.2017 with regard to grant of HRA.
Petitioner further claims that another OM dated 31.01.2020 incorporating
the provisions of HRA in respect of PBORs but excluding the Officers,
was again issued by the respondents. Aggrieved by the OMs dated
31.07.2017 and 31.01.2020 issued by the respondents to the extent that it
only grants benefit of HRA to PBORs only, the present petition has been
filed with the prayer to extend it to Officers also.
6.      Since the grounds urged and relief sought in the above captioned
two petitions are similar, therefore, with the consent of learned counsel for
the parties, these were heard together and are being disposed of by this
common judgment.
7.      Learned counsel appearing on behalf of petitioners contended
W.P.(C) 11083/2019 & W.P.(C) 3370/2020                            Page 4 of 12
before us that while issuing the aforesaid OMs, the respondents have
failed to appreciate the nature of duties and place of postings of
petitioners, which on occasions do not even have basic amenities to keep
their families, including children, with them and so, the respondents
cannot deny grant of HRA for the place where petitioners and such like
officers keep their families. Attention of this Court was drawn to Clauses-
8.7.23, 8.7.24, 8.7.26 of the Seventh Pay Commission to submit that the
competent authority itself was of the view that the personnel of uniformed
services are always unique and, therefore, it cannot be accepted that the
benefit of HRA can be restricted to the PBOR. Learned counsel submitted
that in a somewhat similar situation, this Court in decision in Dev
Sharma, Dy. Comdt. of ITBP Vs. UOI & Anr. 2019 SCC OnLine Del
6797 has struck down the different age of superannuation from Constables
to Commandants and DIG to DG, for being violative of Article 14 and
Article 16 of the Constitution of India. Learned counsel also submitted
that if the benefit of HRA has been extended to the PBORs, the Officers
deployed in paramilitary forces also work under the same conditions and
so, the benefit of HRA cannot be denied to the Officers. Lastly, learned
counsel for petitioner submitted that the OMs dated 31.07.2017 and
31.01.2020 deserve to be set aside to the extent that benefit of HRA be
also extended to the Officers irrespective wherever their families reside.
8.      To the contrary, learned Central Government Standing Counsel
(‘CGSC’) submitted that the representation filed by the petitioners seeking
grant of HRA was considered in the light Office Memorandum No. II-270
12/35/CF-3396486/20            17-PF-I   dated    31.07.2017   issued   by      the
W.P.(C) 11083/2019 & W.P.(C) 3370/2020                               Page 5 of 12
Government of India, Ministry of Home Affair, Police-II Division (PF-I
Desk) and Signal No. P.I-1I2017 dated 08.09.2017 in respect of Seventh
Pay Commission issued by the DIG (Adm) Dte. CRPF and under other
provisions of law. It was submitted that the respondents have only
implemented the recommendations of the Seventh Pay Commission,
which is a policy decision under the instructions of Government of India.
Learned CGSC next submitted that the Seventh Pay Commission
recommended relaxation of HRA norms only in respect of PBORs.
9.      Further submitted that in terms of Rule 41 of CRPF Rules, 1955, all
members of the Force, other than the officers, who are required to reside
at or near the place of their duty for the proper discharge of duty, shall be
provided with rent free accommodation or house rent allowance in lieu
thereof, limited to the actual amount or house rent paid by the member
concerned subject to a maximum of 10 percent of pay and subject to the
condition that the accommodation is conveniently near to the premises in
which their regular duties have to be performed.
10.     Learned CGSC submitted that vide OM No.II.27012/35/CF-
3396486/2017-PF-I dated 31.07.2017, the Ministry of Home Affairs has
sanctioned provision of compensation for housing to PBORs who are not
provided with rent free accommodation or sanctioned HRA in accordance
with Ministry of Finance OM No.2/5/2017-E-II(B) Dated 7.07.2017 and
thereby, all the existing orders for grant of Compensation in Lieu of
Quarters (‘CILQ’) and Family Accommodation Allowance (FAA) to
CAPF personnel stood superseded. Lastly, it was submitted that the
Officers of the force are allowed to keep their families at some safe
W.P.(C) 11083/2019 & W.P.(C) 3370/2020                           Page 6 of 12
location at Group Centers or alike places where proper education & health
facilities are available and they are not entitled to get separate family
accommodation at any location as per their choice as no such provision
exists in the existing rule and thus, these petition deserve to be dismissed.
11.     In rebuttal, learned counsel for petitioners submitted that petitioners
are entitled to Government Accommodation. However, they are posted in
field areas, so their families have to live at their declared GC but also
since high number of officers are there than the accommodations available
in the attached GC, the respondents are granting outliving permission
subject to issuance of ‘No Accommodation Certificate’ by the Directorate
of Estates. But the Officers are granted HRA of the location where their
group is located; whereas subsequent to recommendations of the Seventh
Pay Commission PBORs, who are posted in the field areas and are
carrying similar duties as the petitioners, are paid HRA for keeping their
families at any location as per their convenience. Thus, respondents
cannot be permitted to keep double standards/yardsticks for employees in
the same force and posted in the same area.
12.     To buttress his arguments, learned counsel for petitioners relied
upon decision of Supreme Court in the case of Prem Chand Somchand
Shah Vs. Union of India 1991 (2) SCC 48 to submit that right of equality
implies to similarly situated persons and they have to be treated alike both
in privileges conferred and liabilities imposed. Reliance was also placed
upon decision of this Court in Govind Kumar Srivastava v Union of
India and Ors. 2019 SCC OnLine Del 6425 to submit that respondents
refusal to grant HRA benefit to the petitioners and such like Officer is not
W.P.(C) 11083/2019 & W.P.(C) 3370/2020                             Page 7 of 12
only discriminatory but violative of Article 14 of Constitution of India.
Lastly, learned counsel for petitioners submitted that the arbitrary action
of respondents, discriminating by creating a class within class, deserves to
be set aside.
13.     The submissions advanced by both the sides were heard at length
and upon perusal of the material placed on record we find that Office
Memorandum dated 31.07.2017 notes as under:-
“Consequent upon the acceptance of the
Commission by the Government vide Ministry of
Finance’s Resolution No. 11-1/2016-IC dated 6th
July, 2017, the President is pleased to sanction
provision of compensation for housing to
Personnel Below Officer Rank (PBORs) of
Rifles and NSG, who are not provided with rent
free accommodation or sanctioned HRA in
No.2/5/2017-E.II (B) dated 7th July, 2017…..”
14.     Further the respondents vide Signal dated 15.03.2018 notified as
W.P.(C) 11083/2019 & W.P.(C) 3370/2020                           Page 8 of 12
15.     Pertinently, the aforesaid Office Memorandum dated 31.07.2017
and Signal dated 15.03.2018 were passed after recommendations of the
Seventh Pay Commission, which are noted as under:-
“Analysis and Recommendations
uniformed services are unique in several ways.
They are required to stay in the field for long
periods of time, away from families. Even in non-
field stations (Peace stations), a minimum
strength is required to be maintained in the
barracks for quick deployment at short notice.
8.7.24 It is noted by the Commission that there
was a time when these personnel could leave their
families in villages and go for field postings.
However, times have changed. Many of these
PBORs have working spouses and harbour
legitimate expectations if raising their children in
urban areas.
8.7.25 With the AME percentage being limited,
personnel takes turns to fit into the AME
percentage. An employee who is married but is
less than 25 years of age is not entitled for AME
at all, and therefore cannot avail CILQ. In the
current context the provisions of AME as well as
the stipulated of minimum 25 years of age to
occupy these establishment are outdated and
needs revisiting.
8.7.26     It is felt that the service rendered by
W.P.(C) 11083/2019 & W.P.(C) 3370/2020                          Page 9 of 12
PBORs of uniformed services needs to be
recognized and their housing provisions
simplified. The Commission, in the interactions it
has had with the men on the ground at all field
locations it has visited, has seen firsthand that the
lack of proper housing compensation is a source
of discontentment among these employees.”
16.     The afore-noted commendation of the Seventh Pay Commission
acknowledging the services of uniformed services regarding HRA is
highly appreciated. We are also in consent with the view that they are
required to stay in the fields, far off from all necessary amenities while
leaving their families behind. We, while holding the Chair as the Judges
of this Court as well as normal civilians, respect their will power to stay
away from their families. Interestingly though the competent authority of
Seventh Pay Commission also recognized the lack of proper
compensation and need of paying HRA to these employees, we fail to
understand why the Commission only thought of giving parity to the
PBORs of CAPF at par with PBORs of Defence Forces; while leaving
behind the proposal of extending the same benefit to the Coy
Commanders (officers of the level of Assistant Commandants/ Deputy
Commandants) under examination. It is a strange anomaly which is
sought to be corrected in this petition.
17.     Even in the counter affidavit filed on behalf of respondents and
during the course of arguments, no such submission was made by learned
CGSC appearing on behalf of respondents that the proposal of extending
the same benefit to the Coy Commanders/ Officers of Group A was under
consideration. To the contrary, the stand of respondents is that the
impugned Signal has been passed in compliance of the recommendations
W.P.(C) 11083/2019 & W.P.(C) 3370/2020                           Page 10 of 12
of the Seventh Pay Commission. We are unable to find any reason as to
why officers belonging to the rank of Officers / Coy Commanders or
PBROs, should not be granted similar benefit more so as the factum of
their serving at far off locations has been recognized and it cannot be
differentiated on cadre basis. We fail to understand why such policy
decisions discriminating within the force should be permitted to continue,
especially to the officers of the force who spend their lives serving the
nation.
18.       We have gone through the decision in Supreme Court in Prem
Chand (Supra) relied upon by the petitioners and find that the said case
relates to benefits of flexibilities in imports given to Export Houses and
though the facts of the case are distinguishable and not applicable to the
present case, however, there is no dispute qua the settled position that the
right to equality guaranteed under Article 14 ensures equality amongst
equals and its aim is to protect persons- similarly placed against
discriminatory treatment. We have also gone through the decision of this
Court in Govind Kumar Srivastava (Supra) relied upon by the petitioners,
which pertains to grant of pro-rata pension only to the Commissioned
Officers of the Defence Services and not to non-Commissioned Officers/
PBORs and this Court held that such denial of pro-rata pension to them is
violative of Article 14 of the Constitution. In Dev Sharma (Supra) this
Court while dealing with the case of retirement age of members of the
Central and Allied Forces held that element of discrimination of
retirement age must be done away with.
19.     Applying the ratio of law settled in various decisions to these
W.P.(C) 11083/2019 & W.P.(C) 3370/2020                          Page 11 of 12
petitions, we find that respondents cannot be permitted to take
discriminatory view for personnel of different forces deployed in common
areas for grant of HRA. Accordingly, the Signal dated 15.03.2018 and
letter 22.03.2018, rejecting petitioners’ request for grant of HRA, are
hereby set aside. The impugned Office Memorandum No. II-270
12/35/CF- 3396486/20 17-PF-I dated 31.07.2017 issued by the
Government of India, Ministry of Home Affair, Police-II Division (PF-I
Desk) and the Signal No. P.I-1I2017 dated 08.09.2017 in respect of
Seventh Pay Commission issued by the DIG (Adm) Dte. CRPF, are
hereby partly set aside with direction to the respondents that the benefit of
HRA shall not be confined to only PBORs but shall be extended to all the
personnel of the Forces irrespective of their rank, as per their entitlement.
Further, respondents are directed to take necessary steps within six weeks
of this judgment, in consultation with the Ministry of Home Affairs as
well as Ministry of Finance, to grant benefit of HRA to the petitioners and
similarly situate personnel w.e.f. passing of this judgment.
20.     In view of the above, these petitions are accordingly disposed of.
