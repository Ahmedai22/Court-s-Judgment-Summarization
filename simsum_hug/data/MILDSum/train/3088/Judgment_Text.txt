Shri B.P.S. Chauhan, Counsel for the State.
Case diary is available.
This is fourth application filed under Section 439 of Cr.P.C. for
grant of bail. Previous application was dismissed sed by order dated
7.5.2021 passed in M.Cr.C. No. 22310/2021.
The applicant has been arrested on 25.3.2020 in connection
with Crime No.19/2020 registered by Police Station Baraso Distt.
Bhind for offence punishable under Sections 302, 34 of IPC and
under Section 25/27 of Arms Act.
The previous bail application was decided by a co-ordinate
bench of this Court and due to transfer of Hon'ble Judge, the present
bail application has been listed before this Court.
This application under Section 439 of Cr.P.C has been filed on
the ground that four eye witnesses namely Ramdas (PW-1),
Munnesh Singh (PW-2), Veer Singh (PW-3) and Deepak (PW-4) have
been been examined and they have not supported the prosecution
case. On 5.10.2021, the Co-ordinate Bench expressed its surprise to
note that by order dated 27.8.2021, the trial Court has given up two
eye witnesses namely Hariom and Sarnam Singh on the request of
Public Prosecutor and accordingly the Public Prosecutor was directed
to submit his affidavit for explaining reason for giving up the said
eye witnesses.
Accordingly, today Shri BPS Chauhan provided the affidavit of
Shri Sanjay Kumar Sharma ADP, Bhind in a sealed envelop. The
sealed envelop was opened by the Reader of this Court in open
Court, in the presence of the Counsel for the parties, which contains
the affidavit of Shri Sanjay Kumar Sharma. The affidavit was read-
over in the open Court and Shri M.K.Chaudhry was also permitted to
go through the affidavit. The affidavit is taken on record.
The affidavit of Shri Sanjay Kumar Sharma reads as under:-

Considered the affidavit filed by Shri Sanjay Kumar Sharma.
In the present case Ashok S/o of Sarnam Singh                          is the
deceased. On 27.8.2021 Shri Sanjay Kumar Sharma had given up
Hariom and Sarnam Singh (father of the deceased who is an eye
witness). It is really shocking that the APP who is conducting the trial
has given up such an important eye witness who is the father of the
deceased. In paragraph-4 of the affidavit, it is mentioned that since
Sarnam Singh and Hariom were not supporting the prosecution case,
therefore, in order to save precious time of the Court, these two
witnesses were given up. However, it is not mentioned in the
affidavit that Hariom and Sarnam Singh had ever contacted Shri
Sanjay Kumar Sharma to inform that they would not support the
prosecution case. Even from the order sheet dated 27.8.2021, it is
clear that Hariom and Sarnam Singh were not present in the Court. In
the affidavit also Shri Sanjay Kumar Sharma has not claimed that on
27.8.2021 Hariom and Sarnam were present and had contacted him in
his office. How Shri Sanjay Kumar Sharma was knowing that these
witnesses would not support the prosecution case is also a mystery.
On 27.8.2021 one Deepak (PW-4) was present and he was examined.
When Deepak was also not supporting the prosecution case, then
why he was not given up by Shri Sanjay Kumar Sharma by applying
the same analogy which he has adopted as mentioned in paragraph-4
of his affidavit. This conduct of Shri Sanjay Kumar Sharma indicates
a lot. Thus, it is clear that Shri Sanjay Kumar Sharma has arbitrarily
given up Sarnam Singh who is the father of the deceased and an eye
witness as well as Hariom. However, this Court is refraining itself
from mentioning anything further but one thing is clear that Shri
Sanjay Kumar Sharma has lost the confidence. Accordingly, it is
1. The Public Prosecutor, Bhind shall immediately
withdraw file of this case from Shri Sanjay Kumar
Sharma and Public Prosecutor shall himself conduct
trial and Shri Sanjay Kumar Sharma is directed to stay
away from this case.
2. The     Principal    Secretary, Law   and     Legislative
Affairs/District Magistrate, Bhind (whosoever is the
competent authority) is directed to conduct an enquiry
against Shri Sanjay Kumar Sharma and decide as to
whether his continuation on the post of APP is desirable
or not. Let decision with regard to desirability of Shri
Sanjay Kumar Sharma to continue on APP to be decided
positively within a period of two months from today.
In the meanwhile, Public Prosecutor, Bhind is directed
to withdraw all the Sessions Trial involving offence
under Sections 302, 307, 376/POCSO Act and all other
important matters from Shri Sanjay Kumar Sharma till
the enquiry report is received and the Public Prosecutor
shall assign the cases only thereafter, if the continuation
of Shri Sanjay Kumar Sharma is found to be desirable to
continue on the post of APP.
3. The Public Prosecutor shall immediately file an
application under Section 311 of Cr.P.C for seeking
permission to examine Hariom and Sarnam Singh. Since
this Court has already come to a conclusion that Shri
Sanjay Kumar Sharma APP has wrongly given up these
witnesses, therefore, the trial Court shall consider and
decide the same after considering the importance of the
witnesses.
So far as the present bail application is concerned, the
allegations are that the applicant and his son Ashok had fired causing
death of Ashok S/o of Sarnam Singh (an eye witness).
Considering the totality of facts and circumstances of the
case, this Court is of the considered opinion that it is not a fit case for
grant of bail. The application fails and is hereby dismissed.
Let a copy of this order be sent to the Principal Secretary, Law
and Legislative Affairs, Trial Court, District Magistrate, Bhind and
Public Prosecutor, Bhind along with the copy of order dated
27.8.2021 passed by the trial Court as well as a copy of affidavit of
Shri Sanjay Kumar Sharma which he has sent to this Court in
compliance of order dated 5.10.2021 for necessary information and
compliance.
