This appeal takes exception to the judgment
and order dated 18.11.2021 passed by the Madras
High Court, Bench at Madurai in H.C.P (MD) No.1126
of 2021, whereby the High Court rejected the writ
petition challenging the detention order bearing
No. P.D.No.83 of 2021 dated 20.7.2021 passed by
the   District    Collector   and   District    Magistrate
under    the   Tamil   Nadu   Act,   14/1982-Serving    of
Orders against one Kalyanaodai Senthil @ Senthil,
aged 53 years, son of Durairaj, now confined in
The    detention    order    does    refer   to   the
questionable activities of the detenu, which could
have been good reason to detain him by way of
preventive   action.     However,   the    sole  question
sufficient to dispose of this appeal is: whether
the representation dated 30.07.2021 made by the
detenu to the Additional Chief Secretary to the
had been considered by the appropriate authority
with utmost despatch?        From the response filed
before this Court, it can be noticed as follows:
"It   is    further     submitted      that   the
petitioner    made    another     representation
dated 30.07.2021 to the Additional Chief
Secretary to Government, Home, Prohibition
and Excise department which was received on
18.08.2021 with the request to cancel the
detention order of her husband. After
obtaining the remarks of the Detaining
Authority which was received on 06.09.2021,
the file was circulated on 06.09.2021. The
Minister (E.P. & E) cleared the file on
20.10.2021. Here again the time taken to
clear the file was due to his enormous
responsibility vested with him with his
offiical work. It may be inadvertently
omitted to mention the representation in
the counter filed before the High Court."
The  explanation    offered    by    the   Competent
Authority,   who   was  called    upon   to   decide  the
representation, to say the least, is unacceptable.
For, in the matter of considering representation
made   against    detention    order,    the    Competent
Authority   is  duty   bound   to  do   so   with  utmost
despatch.      The vague explanation of being pre-
engaged with other official work for more than two
months, cannot be countenanced in law.              Notably,
no   details     of   the    official     work   have   been
furnished,     much   less   to    indicate   that   it  was
relatively so urgent that the obligation to decide
the   representation     against    detention    order  with
promptitude could wait for two months.
In    the   present    case,    it   is   an   admitted
position that the representation dated 30.7.2021
was   received     in   the   office    of   the   concerned
Authority on 18.8.2021, the Minister cleared the
file finally on 20.10.2021.           Even if, it may not
be a case of lethargy of the Competent Authority
to consider the representation, the time period of
over   two   months    spent    in  doing   so,   cannot  be
countenanced.       It does not require such a long
time    to   examine    the   representation      concerning
preventive detention of the detenu.
Hence,    this   appeal    ought   to  succeed.     The
impugned judgment and order is set aside.                The
writ petition filed by the appellant for quashing
of the stated detention order stands allowed in
terms of this order.   The detenu is directed to be
set free forthwith, if not required in connection
with any criminal case pending against him.
The appeal(s) stands disposed of in the above
