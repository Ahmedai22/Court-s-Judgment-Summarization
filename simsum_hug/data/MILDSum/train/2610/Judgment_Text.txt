1         Parliament while enacting the Central Goods and Services Tax Act 2017,1 has
incorporated a provision for refund of tax in Section 54. Sub-Section (3) embodies a
provision for refund of unutilised input tax credit2 in cases involving:
(i)      zero rated supplies made without payment of tax; and
(ii)     credit accumulation “on account of rate of tax on inputs being higher than
rate of tax on output supplies”.
2         While envisaging a refund in the latter of the above two situations, Parliament
was cognizant of the fact that ITC may accumulate due to a variety of reasons.
However, Parliament envisaged a specific situation where the credit has
accumulated due to an inverted duty structure, that is where the accumulation of ITC
is because the rate of tax on inputs is higher than the rate of tax on output supplies.
Taking legislative note of this situation, a provision for refund has been provided for
in Section 54(3). The Central Goods and Service Tax Rules 2017 3 have been
formulated in pursuance of the rule making power conferred by Section 164 of the
CGST Act. Rule 89(5) provides a formula for the refund of ITC, in “a case of refund
on account of inverted duty structure”. The said formula uses the term “Net ITC”. In
defining the expression “Net ITC”, Rule 89(5) speaks of “input tax credit availed on
3        Writ petitions under Article 226 of the Constitution were instituted before the
High Court of Gujarat and the High Court of Judicature at Madras. The petitioners
before the High Court submitted inter alia that
(i)      Section 54(3) allows for a refund of ITC where the accumulation is due to
(ii)     ITC includes the credit of input tax charged on the supply of goods as well
(iii)    Section 54(3) does not restrict the entitlement of refund only to unutilised
ITC which is accumulated due to the rate of tax on inputs being higher
than the rate of tax on output supplies. It also allows for refund of
unutilised ITC when the rate of tax on input services is higher than the rate
(iv)     While Section 54(3) allows for a refund of ITC originating in inputs as well
as input services, Rule 89(5) is ultra vires in so far as it excludes tax on
input services from the purview of the formula; and
(v)      In the event that Section 54(3) is interpreted as a restriction against a
claim for refund of accumulated ITC by confining it only to tax on inputs, it
would be unconstitutional as it would lead to discrimination between inputs
and input services.
4        By its judgment dated 24 July 2020 in VKC Footsteps India Pvt. Ltd. v.
Union of India4, the Division Bench of the Gujarat High Court, held that:
“Explanation (a) to Rule 89(5) which denies the refund of
“unutilised input tax” paid on “input services” as part of “input
tax credit” accumulated on account of inverted duty structure
is ultra vires the provision of Section 54(3) of the CGST Act,
The High Court therefore directed the Union Government to allow the claim for
refund made by the petitioners before it, considering unutilised ITC on input services
as part of “Net ITC” for the purpose of calculating refund in terms of Rule 89(5), in
furtherance of Section 54(3).
5        By its judgment dated 21 September 2020, in Tvl. Transtonnelstroy Afcons
Joint Venture v. Union of India5 and connected cases the Division Bench of the
Madras High Court came to a contrary conclusion, after having noticed the view of
the Gujarat High Court, which it has declined to follow. The Madras High Court has
(1) Section 54(3)(ii) does not infringe Article 14.
(2) Refund is a statutory right and the extension of the benefit
of refund only to the unutilised credit that accumulates on
account of the rate of tax on input goods being higher than
the rate of tax on output supplies by excluding unutilised input
tax credit that accumulated on account of input services is a
valid classification and a valid exercise of legislative power.”
Writ Petition Nos 8596, 8597, 8602, 8603, 8605 and 8608 of 2019
6      The writ petitions challenging the validity of Rule 89(5) on the ground that it is
ultra vires Section 54(3)(ii) were dismissed. The divergence between the views of
the Gujarat High Court on the one hand, and the Madras High Court on the other,
forms the subject matter of this batch of appeals.
7      Section 54 of the CGST Act provides for a refund of tax. Under sub-Section
(1) of Section 54, a person claiming a refund of “tax and interest, if any, paid on such
tax or any other amount paid” has to make an application within two years of the
relevant date. Section 54(3) provides for a claim of refund of unutilised ITC. Sub-
sections (1) and (3) of Section 54 provide as follows:
(1) Any person claiming refund of any tax and interest, if any,
paid on such tax or any other amount paid by him, may make
an application before the expiry of two years from the relevant
date in such form and manner as may be prescribed:
Provided that a registered person, claiming refund of any
balance in the electronic cash ledger in accordance with the
provisions of sub-section (6) of Section 49, may claim such
refund in the return furnished under section 39 in such
manner as may be prescribed.
(3) Subject to the provisions of sub-section (10), a registered
person may claim refund of any unutilised input tax credit at
Provided that no refund of unutilized input tax credit shall be
(i) zero rated supplies made without payment of tax;
(ii) where the credit has accumulated on account of rate
of tax on inputs being higher than the rate of tax on
output supplies (other than nil rated or fully exempt
supplies), except supplies of goods and services or both
Provided further that no refund of unutilized input tax credit
shall be allowed in cases where the goods exported out of
Provided also that no refund of input tax credit shall be
allowed, if the supplier of goods or services or both avails of
drawback in respect of central tax or claims refund of the
integrated tax paid on such supplies.”
8         Rule 89 was originally inserted in the CGST Rules through the Central Goods
and Services Tax (Second Amendment) Rules 20176, which came into force on 1
July 2017. Rule 89(4) and Rule 89(5) were in the following terms:
(B) “Net ITC” means input tax credit availed on inputs
and input services during the relevant period;
(E) “Adjusted Total turnover” means the turnover in a State
or a Union territory, as defined under sub-section (112) of
section 2, excluding the value of exempt supplies other
than zero-rated supplies, during the relevant period;
(5) In the case of refund on account of inverted duty structure,
refund of input tax credit shall be granted as per the following
Maximum Refund Amount= {(Turnover of inverted rated
supply of goods) x Net ITC ÷ Adjusted Total Turnover} − tax
payable on such inverted rated supply of goods
Notification No.10/2017- Central Tax by the Government of India, Ministry of Finance, Department of Revenue,
Explanation:- For the purposes of this sub rule, the
expressions “Net ITC” and “Adjusted Total turnover”
shall have the same meanings as assigned to them in
sub-rule (4).”
9         On 18 April 2018, the Central Goods and Services Tax (Fourth Amendment)
Rules 20187 were notified. Rule 89(5) was amended in the following terms
“(5). In the case of refund on account of inverted duty
structure, refund of input tax credit shall be granted as per the
Maximum Refund Amount= {(Turnover of inverted rated
supply of goods and services) x Net ITC ÷ Adjusted Total
Turnover} − tax payable on such inverted rated supply of
goods and services.
Explanation:- For the purposes of this sub-rule, the
(a) “Net ITC” shall mean input tax credit availed on
inputs during the relevant period other than the input
tax credit availed for which refund is claimed under
(b) “Adjusted Total turnover” shall have the same meaning as
assigned to it in sub-rule (4).”
The amendment was with prospective effect. Rule 89(5), as it stands at present, was
substituted on 13 June 2018 by the Central Goods and Services Tax (Fifth
Amendment) Rules 20188. By the amendment, Rule 89(5) was substituted with the
retrospective effect from 1 July 2017 in the following terms:
“(iii) with effect from 01st July 2017, in rule 89, for sub-rule
(5), the following shall be substituted namely:-
Notification No.21/2018- Central Tax by the Government of India, Ministry of Finance, Department of Revenue,
Notification No.26/2018- Central Tax by the Government of India, Ministry of Finance, Department of Revenue of
“(5) In the case of refund on account of inverted duty
structure, refund of input tax credit shall be granted as per the
Maximum Refund Amount= {(Turnover of inverted rated
supply of goods and services) x Net ITC ÷ Adjusted Total
Turnover} − tax payable on such inverted rated supply of
goods and services.
Explanation:- For the purposes of this sub-rule, the
(a) Net ITC shall mean input tax credit availed on inputs
during the relevant period other than the input tax
credit availed for which refund is claimed under sub-
(b) Adjusted Total turnover shall have the same meaning as
assigned to it in sub-rule (4).””
The above sequence indicates that the definition of the expression ‘Net ITC’ in Rule
89(5) originally meant “input tax credit availed on input and inputs services”. By the
amendment of 18 April 2018, the definition of ‘Net ITC’ was substituted so as to
mean ITC availed on inputs, with prospective effect. On 13 June 2018, this definition
was made applicable with retrospective effect from 1 July 2017.
10     Before we proceed to analyse the submissions and formulate the points for
consideration, it is necessary to emphasise at the outset that one of the core issues
in the present batch of cases would turn upon the interpretation of the expression
“inputs” in Section 54(3)(ii) of CGST Act and the definition of “Net ITC” in the
amended Rule 89(5). During the course of the submissions, in the interest of
maintaining clarity, Counsel on both sides used the expression ‘input goods’ while
dealing with goods that are used as inputs and ‘input services’ while dealing with
services that are used as inputs. We propose to use the same formulation to ensure
conceptual clarity while distinguishing between goods which are used as inputs and
services which are used as inputs. With this preface, we shall now proceed to deal
with the submissions of the parties.
D.1.1 Part I- Distinction between goods and services
11       Mr N Venkataraman, learned Additional Solicitor General9 led the arguments
on behalf of the Union Government in assailing the correctness of the decision of the
Gujarat High Court (and supporting the decision of Madras High Court). Mr
(i)     Goods and services are distinct at a constitutional level. Article 366(12) of
the Constitution defines goods, while Section 366(26A) defines services.
Under the CGST Act, the expression ‘input’ in Section 2(59) means
tangible commodities other than capital goods, while on the other hand
‘input service’ in Section 2(60) means any service used or intended to be
used by a supplier for business. Hence, ‘goods’ and ‘services’ and ‘inputs’
and ‘input services’ have distinct definitions;
(ii)    Article 366(12A) defines ‘goods and services tax’ to mean any tax on the
supply of goods or services or both except taxes on the supply of alcoholic
(iii)    Article 246A, which traces the source of power of taxation and identifies
the fields of taxation, empowers the Parliament, the States and Union
Territories to impose simultaneous tax both on goods and services.
Consequently, though goods and services are brought to tax under a
common code, both the Constitution and the statute have maintained a
distinction between goods and services. They remain distinct for
prescription, treatment and interpretation;
(iv)     Section 2(62) and Section 2(63) define ‘input tax’ and ‘input tax credit’
which include taxes paid on goods (input goods) and services (input
services) either under CGST, State Goods and Services Tax Act 10 and
Integrated Goods and Services Tax Act 201711;
(v)      Input tax means a tax charged both on goods and services. These are
taxes paid by a supplier on their outward supplies as defined under
Section 2(83) which become inward supply for the recipient under Section
(vi)     The need to integrate both taxes on input goods and input services is to
enable credit on a single pool for further cross utilisation on both goods
and services.
D.1.2 Part II- Interpretation of Section 54(3)
(i)      The structure of Section 54(3) is as follows:
(a)      The opening clause permits a registered person to claim refund of any
unutilised ITC at the end of any tax period.
iv.       at the end of the tax period.
(ii)      Section 54(3) contains three provisos, out of which the first proviso falls for
interpretation in this case. The three provisos share common features
which indicate that these provisos are in the nature of restrictions and not
(iii)     The provisos to Section 54(3) should be construed as restrictions for the
(a)      The expression employed in the main clause of Section 54(3) is ‘claim’
whereas the provisos restrict this ambit by the use of the expression
‘allowed’. The expression ‘allowed’ appears in all the three provisos;
(b)      The main clause of Section 54(3) uses the expression “any unutilised
ITC”. On the other hand, the expression ‘any’ is conspicuous by its
(c)      The main clause of Section 54(3) uses the expression “a registered
person may claim refund” while on the other hand, the three provisos
have employed a restrictive expression or a negative expression, that
is, “no refund of unutilized ITC shall be allowed”;
(d)     When the main clause used the expression ‘any’, this is expressly
restricted by the use of the expression “no refund of unutilised ITC shall
be allowed in cases other than”. In other words, the expression ‘any’
(e)     In view of the above, the provisos under Section 54(3) have to be read
and interpreted as restrictions and not as qualifications;
(iv)     The first proviso restricts the refund of unutilized ITC only to two situations
and the subsequent two provisos further restrict it to one of the categories
out of the two in the first proviso. The two situations contemplated in the
first proviso deal with contrasting situations with stark differences:
(a)     Sub clause (i) of the first proviso deals with zero rated supplies which
are exports. Exports of goods and services are not taxable. Hence, the
taxes paid either on exported goods or services or on the input
goods/input services or both used in the export of such goods and
(b)     However, sub-clause (ii) of the first proviso deals with domestic
supplies which are taxable outward supplies, in respect of which
Parliament has chosen to allow refund of unutilised ITC only to the
extent of the ‘credit accumulated on account of rate of tax on inputs’;
(v)     The first proviso cannot be read as a mere qualification or eligibility for the
grant of refund on the entire unutilised ITC comprising input goods and
input services by a specified registered person, for the following reasons:
(a)    The expression used is ‘the credit’ and the accumulation is restricted
only on account of ‘inputs’. This cannot be read or interpreted to
(b)    The proviso limits the grant of refund only to two circumstances and
hence the limitation has to be read as it is without extending it to input
services and capital goods, specifically since the legislature has not
(c)    If the intention was to allow refund of unutilised ITC on account of input
services and capital goods, in addition to input goods, such an intent
would have been conveyed through statutory language, which is
(d)    The expression ‘credit’ has to be read along with ‘inputs’ and cannot be
read as to extend a refund to input services and capital goods also,
which are expressly not referred to in the proviso;
(e)    ‘The credit’ in sub clause (ii) can go only with the expression ‘inputs’
and excludes accumulation of any credit on account of rate of tax on
(f)    When there is an express inclusion limited only to the credit
accumulation arising out of ‘inputs’, it would not be permissible to
include input services and capital goods in the face of the statutory
provision. What has not been included in the statute should not be
included by way of judicial interpretation;
(vi)     The reason why Parliament has adopted the expression ‘unutilised ITC’ in
the main part of Section 54(3) and the first proviso, but has chosen to
employ only the expression ‘inputs’ is as follows:
(a)    There is a significant difference between the main provision and the
first proviso even in the use of the expression ‘unutilized ITC’. The
expression ‘any’ in the main Section is absent in the first proviso with
the further limitation that refund of ‘unutilized ITC’ is limited only to two
(b)    The first situation deals with refund on account of zero-rated supplies
which are exports where refund is granted on all the taxes paid on input
goods, input services including taxes paid on export supplies. This is
evident from Explanation-I to Section 54(3) where the expression
(c)    However, when it comes to an inverted duty tax structure, the refund is
limited to only one category namely, ‘credit accumulated on account of
(d)    The expression ‘unutilized ITC’ could comprise of taxes paid both on
input goods and input services, and the first proviso and the main
Section necessarily have to employ the expression ‘unutilized ITC’ to
take care of zero-rated supplies which are exports under the first
(e)   When it comes to an inverted tax structure, it is limited only to ‘inputs’. It
is a common fact that unutilized credit arising out of input services also
(f)   Parliament has rightly used the expression ‘unutilised ITC’ both in the
main clause and in the first proviso to deal with zero rated supplies and
restricted refund to those arising out of ‘inputs’ when it comes to an
(g)   Parliament could not have used the expression ‘inputs’ in the main
clause and first proviso as this would act as a disability to zero rated
supplies where Parliament intended to grant a refund arising out of
(h)   Parliament has therefore appropriately employed the expression
‘unutilized ITC’ in the main clause and the first proviso and has used
the limited expression ‘inputs’ in sub-clause (ii) to the first proviso in the
(vii)    Explanation-I to Section 54(3) defines refund in three parts:
(a)   When it comes to zero rated supplies on exports, it extends the refund
to ‘inputs’, ‘input services’ and also taxes paid on zero rated supplies of
(b)     When it comes to deemed exports, it restricts the refund of tax only on
(c)     When it comes to inverted structure, it limits it as provided in the
proviso to Section 54(3). This is one more reason to read the proviso to
Section 54(3), as a restriction and not as a qualification. If the intent of
Parliament was to grant a refund arising both out of input goods and
input services even in the case of inverted tax structure, it would have
defined refund in Explanation-I at par with zero rated supplies and
there was no need to limit it only to one situation of the credit
accumulation arising on account of ‘inputs’.
(i)       Article 265 of the Constitution provides that no tax shall be levied or
collected except by authority of law. There being no challenge either to the
levy or collection of taxes in these cases, taxes paid into the coffers of the
Union Government or the States become the property of the Union/States;
(ii)      The refund of taxes is neither a fundamental right nor a constitutional right.
The Constitution only guarantees that the levy should be legal and that the
collection should be in accordance with law. There is no constitutional right
to refund. Refund is always a matter of a statutory prescription and can be
regulated by the statute subject to conditions and limitations;
(iii)     Even in the case of an illegal levy or a levy which is unconstitutional, the
decision of the nine judges Bench in Mafatlal Industries Limited v. Union
of India12 held that the right of refund is not automatic. The burden of proof
lies on the claimant to establish that it would not cause unjust enrichment;
(iv)     Though tax enactments are subject to Articles 14 and 19(1)(g) of the
Constitution, this is subject to two well-settled principles:
(a)     Discriminatory treatment under tax laws is not per se invalid. It is invalid
only when equals are treated unequally or unequals are treated
equally. Both under the Constitution and the CGST Act, goods,
services, input (goods) and input services are not one and the same.
These are distinct species, though covered by a common code; and
(b)     The legislature is entitled to the widest latitude when it identifies
categories of classification and unless things constituting the same
class are treated differently without a rationale, the provision cannot be
(v)      The doctrine of reading down is employed to narrow down the scope of a
proviso under challenge, when it may otherwise be unconstitutional. The
doctrine cannot result in expansion of a statutory provision for refund
which would amount to rewriting the legislation;
(vi)     Accepting the submission of the assessees that goods and services must
be treated at par can lead to drastic consequences in terms of:
(c)     intervention in the areas of political, economic and legislative policies;
(vii)    Refund of taxes is one form of granting exemption;
(viii)   Once a refund is construed as a form of exemption from taxes, the
provision has to attract strict interpretation;
(ix)     Exemptions, concessions and exceptions have to be treated at par and
(x)      ITC is not a matter of right and the burden of proof is on the assessee to
establish a claim for a concession or benefit;
(xi)     The manner in which a proviso can be construed has been elucidated in
the precedents of this Court. A proviso may not be only an exception but
may constitute a restriction on the operation of the main statutory
(xii)    A legislative amendment which reflects a policy choice is not subject to
judicial review.
12      Mr Balbir Singh, learned ASG has adopted the submissions of Mr N
Venkataraman, learned ASG.
13         Mr V Sridharan, learned Senior Counsel appearing on behalf of the
(i)      The assessee is, inter alia, engaged in the manufacture and supply of
footwear which attracts output tax (goods and services tax14) at the rate of
(ii)     The assessee, inter alia, procures input goods such as synthetic leather,
PU Polyol and input services such as job work service, goods transport
agency service on payment of applicable GST for use in the course of
business and avails ITC on the GST paid thereon. A majority of the input
goods and input services attract tax at the rate of 12% or 18%;
(iii)    The rate of GST paid by the assessee on procurement of input goods and
input services is higher than the rate of tax payable on their outward
supply of footwear. Therefore, despite utilization of credit for payment of
GST on outward supply, there is an accumulation of unutilized ITC in the
(iv)     The assessee applied for refund of such unutilised accumulated ITC under
Section 54(3) of the CGST Act read with Rule 89(5) of the CGST Rules;
(v)      Rule 89(5) of the CGST Rules as originally enacted provided for refund of
ITC availed on both inputs (that is input goods) and input services and was
in line with Section 54(3) of the CGST Act. Accordingly, the assessee was
(vi)   Rule 89(5) was substituted by Notification No. 21/2018-CT dated 18 April
2018 prescribing a revised formula for determining the refund on account
of inverted duty structure. The above substitution was given retrospective
effect from 1 July 2017 by Notification No. 26/2018-CT dated 13 June
(vii)  The revised formula inter alia excludes ‘input services’ from the scope of
‘Net ITC’ for computation of the refund amount under the said Rule;
(viii) The substituted Rule 89(5) of the CGST Rules denies refund on the
unutilised ITC availed on input services and allows relief of refund of ITC
(ix)   The Revenue is relying on amended Rule 89(5) to contend that refund will
not be allowed on taxes paid on input services; and
(x)    The Revenue is allowing refund of accumulated ITC of tax paid on input
goods such as synthetic leather, and PU Polyol. Further, the Revenue is
allowing accumulation of ITC paid on procurement of input services such
as job work service and goods transport agency service. However, the
refund of accumulated unutilised ITC paid on input services is being
denied and refund already granted has been recovered from the
assessee.
14        Mr Sridharan urged that Rule 89(5) of the CGST Rules, to the extent to which
it denies refund of ITC relatable to input services, is ultra vires Section 54. The
submission has been premised on the following propositions:
(i)     GST is a destination-based consumption tax. The fundamental principle of
GST laws worldwide is that it is a multistage tax. Each point in a supply
chain is potentially taxed. However, suppliers are entitled to avail credit of
taxes paid at an anterior stage. This feature of GST leads to its description
as being a tax on value addition, with the final consumer alone ultimately
bearing the tax. The GST laws enacted in India are also based on this
(ii)    In All India Federation of Tax Practitioners v. Union of India15, this
Court held that excise duty, service tax and value added tax legislation
provide for taxes on value addition and are destination based-consumption
taxes. These are not charges on the business but on the consumer.
Though the erstwhile tax legislation, prior to the enforcement of the
Constitution (One Hundred and First Amendment) Act 2016, was based on
the principle of value addition and consumption tax, there was no
seamless flow of credit between Central and State levies. This anomaly
was sought to be addressed by the constitutional amendment and by the
legislation which has been enacted in pursuance of it;
(iii)     The purpose of the One Hundred and First Constitutional Amendment
(a)     to replace a number of indirect taxes being levied by the Union
(b)     to obviate and remove the cascading effect of taxes; and
(c)     to provide for a common national market for goods and services.
(iv)      The Statement of Objects and Reasons accompanying the bill introducing
the CGST Act also emphasised that there would be a seamless transfer of
ITC from one stage to another in the chain of value addition;
(v)       These principles reaffirmed the guidelines issued by the Organisation of
Economic Co-operation and Development which emphasise that
(a)     value added tax systems are designed to tax final consumption;
(b)     only the consumers should bear the tax burden; and
(c)     the main characteristic of a value added tax is of preserving neutrality
in the value chain.
(vi)      Compelling economic and fiscal realities necessitated the levy of value
added tax like GST in place of traditional excise duties, service tax, sales
(vii)     In a tax regime which was not based on value added tax, ensuring refund
of tax paid at various stages of manufacturing would be cumbersome and
complicated. It was to obviate the problems of the earlier regime that GST
legislation was enacted by various countries including India to fully
effectuate    the   principle  underlying    value-added     destination-based
(viii)   The situation in which the quantum of input taxes exceeds output tax is an
anomaly, aberration and distortion resulting from various sources of taxes
and conflicts with the fundamental principles of GST. The impact of these
distortions can be revealed by practical examples involving situations such
(a)     Intermediate products attracting a lower rate of tax; and
(b)     Intermediate products attracting a higher rate of tax.
(ix)     As a result, varied situations of economic distortion resulting from a
cascading effect of taxes in the form of unabsorbed ITC emerged due to
variations in the rate of taxes. This is against the basic tenets of GST. GST
being a consumption tax, postulates that the only tax in the entire chain
should be the tax charged to the end customer without any ‘sticking’ or
(x)      Government may in the public interest impose lower rates of tax on
products such as fertilizers, tractors and lower-price footwear. The
objective of taxing such goods at a lower rate is frustrated if inputs for
making the final products are taxed at a higher rate and no refund of
unutilized credit is granted. Refund of unutilised ITC seeks to achieve the
objective of value-added consumption-based taxation in its true sense;
(xi)   Cognizant of the anomaly resulting from inverted duty structures, the
erstwhile State Value Added Tax legislations provided for refund of
unutilized ITC, even before the GST legislation saw the light of the day;
(xii)  A near perfect GST legislation provides for refund of ITC in a situation
involving an inverted duty structure. The provisions for refund ensure that
anomalies in tax rates do not result in distortions to the fundamental
features of GST which remains a true consumption tax. ITC may
accumulate for a variety of reasons including (a) inverted duty structure,
that is, GST on output supplies is less than the GST on the input supplies;
(b) stock accumulation; (c) capital goods; and (d) partial reverse charge
(xiii) The cascading effect or sticking credit may arise on account of higher
taxes paid on input goods or input services. Refund of unutilized ITC will
ensure the elimination of the cascading effect of taxes in a true sense;
(xiv) Section 54(3) has been enacted to achieve the objective of removing the
cascading effect of unutilized ITC. Section 54(3) provides for refund of
“any unutilised input tax credit” but the refund is available in only two
situations namely, (a) zero rated supplies; and (b) inverted duty structure.
The quantum of refund is provided by the main part of Section 54(3) which
stipulates the refund of any unutilised ITC. This includes credit availed on
input goods as well as on input services having regard to the definitions
(xv)  The proviso only provides for cases in which the refund under the main
provisions of Section 54(3) will be available. Once the requirement of
inverted duty structure in proviso (ii) is fulfilled, the entire unutilised ITC
has to be refunded. The reason why proviso (ii) defines the inverted duty
structure with reference to only input (goods) vis-a-vis output supplies may
be that while services (barring a few) were leviable to tax at 18 per cent,
goods were subject to various categories of rates. If input services were
also considered for determining inverted duty structure, refund may be
required to be granted practically to all the assessees. Hence, the
legislature defined inverted duty structure only with reference to ‘inputs’
(input goods). However, once a case fulfils the condition of an inverted
duty structure, refund of the entire unutilised ITC which is attributable to
inverted duty structure supplies is allowed, including the credit availed on
(xvi) A circular has been issued on 31 December 2018, being Circular No.
79/53/2018-GST by the Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs16. In
a situation where GST on some inputs is higher than the rate of GST
applicable on the output supply, while the rate of GST on other inputs is
lower than the GST on the output supply, the circular provides that refund
will be granted by taking the ITC availed on all inputs, including input
services, which attract a lower rate of tax than on output supply. The
circular, in other words, does not treat Section 54(3) read with the proviso
(ii) as qualifying the extent of refund but only as a pre-condition to qualify
(xvii) Proviso (ii) to Section 54(3) only lays down ‘cases’ where refund is eligible
but it does not define the quantum of refund. This will be evident from the
(a)      The quantum of refund is provided in the main segment to Section
54(3). The expression “any” unutilised ITC means all unutilised ITC;
(b)      The definitions of ‘input tax credit’ under Section 2(63) and ‘input tax’ in
Section 2(62) would indicate that both input goods and input services
(c)      The proviso indicates the ‘cases’ in which refund will be eligible. The
expression ‘cases’ means situations or circumstances;
(d)      Clause (ii) of the first proviso commences with the expression “where”
which signifies that what follows will be a situation or aspect of
(e)      The statutory provision must be read as a whole and in the context of
other provisions. All the three provisos refer to cases in which refund is
allowed or, as the case may be, not allowed and do not refer to the
(f)      Clause (ii) of the proviso refers to “the credit”. The use of the definitive
article clearly indicates that the reference is to unutilised ITC already
mentioned in the main part of Section 54(3). The expression ‘the’
signifies one particular sum or credit and any attempt to bifurcate it into
credit on input goods and input services will produce anomalous
(g) The expression ‘accumulated’ signifies the credit balance which is
unutilized after credit has been availed and utilised for making
(h) Clause (ii) of the proviso uses the words “on account of” which means
by reason of or because of. By stipulating that the proviso provides for
the quantum of refunds, the Revenue is attempting to substitute the
words “on account of” with “to the extent of”;
(i) The submission of the Revenue cannot be accepted because clause
(ii) of the proviso refers to the rate of tax. To accept the interpretation of
the Revenue, the words “and only to the extent” will have to be added
(j) Though the CGST Act makes a distinction between ‘inputs’ and ‘input
services’, this is only relevant at the stage prior to the availment of
credit, namely to determine the eligibility of credits under Sections 16
and 17 of the CGST Act. After the credit has been availed, it goes in a
common pool from which the credit is utilised for making payment for
output tax. Utilization happens from the entire credit available for the
tax period in this common pool and it cannot be co-related to ITC
availed on particular input goods or input services. The balance is the
unutilised ITC at the end of the tax period. At this stage, it is not
possible to determine whether the balance pertains to ITC availed on
(k)    Alternatively, the words, “rate of tax on inputs” must be read to include
whatever goes in the making of output supplies namely, both input
goods and input services.
(xviii) Explanation (1) to Section 54 covers four cases of refund: (a) refund of tax
paid on zero-rated supplies of goods or services; (b) refund of tax paid on
input goods or input services used in making zero rated supplies (where
no output tax is paid); (c) refund of tax on the supply of goods regarded as
deemed exports; (d) refund of unutilised ITC under sub-Section (3). In the
case of (a) above, the legislature has used the expression “goods or
services”; in the case of (b), “inputs or input services”; in the case of (c),
“goods or services”. However, in respect of refund of unutilised ITC, it has
only been provided that the refund will be granted as provided under sub-
Section (3). The explanation does not restrict the refund only to credit
availed on input goods in the case of an inverted rated structure;
(xix)   Rule 89(5) by confining refund of unutilised ITC on input goods and
denying refund of ITC on input services curtails the ambit of Section 54(3)
(a) Rule 89(5) originally provided for refund of ITC paid both on input
goods and input services but it was amended with retrospective effect
to restrict refund only to ITC availed on input goods;
(b) After the amendment in terms of the formula, the ratio of proportionate
turnover is applied only to ITC availed on input goods. However, after
arriving at the proportionate value, the entire amount of tax paid on
output supplies is deducted. The formula erroneously assumes that the
entire output tax will be paid from ITC availed on input goods and the
credit on input services will not be utilised for payment of output tax. If
the rule took into computation ITC availed on both input goods and
input services, both parts of the formula would be comparable and
would result in a correct amount of unutilised ITC attributable to an
inverted duty structure. The rule is ultra vires Section 54(3) since it
restricts the computation of refund only by taking into account the credit
availed on input goods. Section 54(3) provides for entitlement to
refund, its quantum and the cases in which the refund is to be granted.
Section 54(3) being a code in itself, there is no reference to a provision
enabling the Government to frame rules in this regard. Hence, with
reference to Section 54(3), any exercise of the rule making power is
(xx)   The general rule making power conferred by Section 164(1) is to carry out
the provisions of the CGST Act and cannot save the offending provisions
(a)     Accumulation of credit may occur due to various reasons such as
absence of outward supplies in a tax period, supplies made at a loss,
bulk purchase of inputs, excess opening balance of credit, and change
(b)     A rule which provides for the identification of unutilised ITC which is
attributable to supplies having an inverted duty structure and bifurcating
it from credit accumulating due to other causes would be for the
purpose of carrying out the provisions of the CGST Act;
(c)     A rule may provide a proportionate formula for determining the pro-rata
amount of credit relatable to the inverted duty structure vis-a-vis total
turnover. Such a formula may be needed where the assessee is
making supplies involving an inverted duty structure as well as supplies
(d)     Where the entire supplies made by assessee are by way of export, the
entire ITC is refundable under proviso (i). However, where an assessee
is engaged in exporting goods and in domestic supplies, the assessee
should be eligible for claiming refund from ITC attributable to exports
while not being entitled to cash refund on ITC relatable to domestic
supplies. In such cases where an assessee makes both domestic
supplies as well as exports, a formula may be required to estimate the
ITC relatable to exports which alone can be refunded to the assessee
in a similar manner if an assessee has output supplies. Where an
assessee has output supplies having an inverted duty structure and
output supplies not having an inverted duty structure, refund is to be
given only for the former and not for the latter. The formula would be
required for that purpose. Rule 89(4) relating to export adopts pro-rata
of export turnover to total turnover as the basis. Rule 89(5) is similarly
enacted to deal with an assessee having inverted duty structure
supplies and other supplies not having an inverted duty structure. This
should be the sole purpose of the formula for Rule 89(5);
(e)    However, Rule 89(5) in the garb of fixing a formula for determining pro-
rata the amount of credit relatable to the inverted duty structure vis-à-
vis total turnover has restricted the refund to ITC on input goods by
denying it on input services. This has been done by defining ‘Net ITC’
to mean ITC availed on all ‘inputs’, thus overlooking ITC relatable to
input services. Such a rule cannot be treated as one for carrying out
(xxi)   A delegated legislation can be struck down as ultra vires of a principal
statute. The laying of delegated legislation before Parliament does not
confer any validity on such ultra vires rules. The process of laying rules
before Parliament and making them subject to modification or annulment
cannot be equated with legislation which has the assent of the President,
or the Governor, as the case may be. The doctrine of ultra vires will apply
even if a resolution is passed by Parliament approving or modifying the
rules. Though, the CGST Rules have been laid before Parliament, any part
which is ultra vires the CGST Act is liable to be struck down;
(xxii) The fact that the rules have been recommended by the Goods and
Services Tax Council 17 does not elevate them to the status of a statute
enacted by the legislature. The recommendations made by the GST
Council under Article 279A(4) of the Constitution take effect only after they
have been incorporated in the legislation passed by the Parliament or the
State legislature. The CGST Act and SGST Act have been enacted on the
recommendations of the GST Council, in exercise of the power under
Article 279A, while the CGST Rules have been framed on the
recommendations of the GST Council in exercise of the powers conferred
by Section 2(87) and Section 164 of the CGST Act. There is a clear
distinction between laws enacted by the legislature and delegated
legislation. A rule made on the recommendation of the GST Council must
be in consonance with the relevant legislation, failing which it would be
(xxiii) Section 54(3) grants a refund of the entire unutilised ITC in the case of an
inverted duty structure irrespective of whether the credit pertains to input
goods or input services. The amendment made in Rule 89(5) which
restricts the refund of unutilised ITC availed only on ‘inputs’ is ultra vires
(xxiv) By virtue of the doctrine of severability that portion of Rule 89(5) which is
ultra vires may be struck down. This would not constitute judicial
legislation. The challenge to the vires of Rule 89(5) is only because of the
definition of ‘Net ITC’ in the explanation to the rule. The explanation
defines net ITC to mean ITC availed on inputs during relevant period.
Section 54(3) allows refund of any unutilized ITC and not only credit on
input goods. Consequently, only if the expression “on inputs” employed in
Explanation (a) to Rule 89(5) is struck down, will Rule 89(5) be in line with
15        Mr Sujit Ghosh, learned Counsel18 submitted that

not a restriction but merely prescribes threshold conditions;

(iv)   The object and purpose of Section 54(3) must be borne in mind:
(a)   The purpose of the provision is to give effect to the doctrine of
equivalence or neutrality which is the basic objective of the GST and
this is sought to be achieved by granting seamless credit through
(b)   The legislative background and preparatory material duly support the
(c)   The State does not want the taxpayers to suffer the ill effect of tax
cascading solely because of its decision to offer a reduced rate of tax on
(d)   In the case of the petitioner which is engaged in providing services to
Chennai Metro Rail, the original rate of output tax used to be 18 per cent
while the input tax on goods and services was between 18 per cent to
28 per cent. As a result of Notification No. 1/2018 and a corresponding
State notification, the rate of tax on output supplies, namely construction
of mono rails and metro rails, was reduced to 12 per cent;
(e)   Section 54(3) is not intended to cover a situation where the inverted
duty structure is created by assessee due to its own actions such as
discount/distress/non-supply as distinguished from the rate structure
(f)   The object of achieving tax neutrality is sought to be implemented for
the first time through the anti-profiteering measure embodied in Section
(v)    The international jurisprudence on GST and tax neutrality postulates that
such taxes are not a permanent cost to the business and that businesses
are pass through entities. The essential character is of an economically
neutral tax through a seamless flow of credit;
(vi)   A contextual interpretation of Section 54(3) must look at the overall
scheme of the statute. The substantive part of Section 54(3) deals with the
quantum of credit which is amplified by three attributes:
(a)    it connotes a finite sum and thus a quantum, since a time period is
prescribed for identifying such quantum by the use of the phrase “at the
(b)    Section 54(3) needs to be read contextually with sub-Sections (4), (5)
and (6) of Section 49 and Rule 86(3) and Rule 89(3); and
(c)    Both the GST Council and the Union Government also understood that
the quantum of refund was the entire unutilised ITC and not only ITC
accumulated on account of input goods. This is evident from
Notification No. 5/2017 dated 28 June 2017. If the exception
contemplated in clause (ii) of the first proviso to Section 54(3)
contemplates denial of the entire basket of unutilised ITC (as argued by
the State) a fortiori the first part of clause (ii) should be presumed to
include refund of the entire basket of unutilised credit. This is because
unless the first part of clause (ii) did not entitle refund of the entire
basket of ITC, carving out an exception for denial of the entire basket of
ITC in the latter part would be absurd.
(vii)  The expression ‘claim’ means a demand made of right, calling upon
another to pay something which is due. Accordingly, a claim in the context
of Section 54(3) is a demand for enforcement of a right of refund which
becomes due. The entitlement to the right is not through the process of
allowance of the claim but instead, the enforcement of the right is through
the process of allowance. The entitlement to the right of the entire basket
of credit accrues from the substantive provision and its enforcement
(viii) The expression ‘allowed’ should be interpreted to mean verification of the
claim and its sanction. Allowed cannot mean the ‘creation of an
entitlement’ or else the main provision of Section 54(3) would become
(ix)   The phrase “wholly on account of” is conspicuous by its absence in
(x)    The absence of the word ‘any’ in the proviso is not fatal. Despite the
absence of ‘any’, the words “unutilised ITC” refer to credit on goods and
(xi)   The proviso to Section 54(3) merely prescribes the condition and does not
deal with the quantum of refund since the quantum is prescribed by the
substantive provision. The proviso is not an exception to the substantive
part since it makes a reference to the substantive condition to be satisfied.
Both must be construed harmoniously. Thus, the main provision of Section
54(3) confers an entitlement to the refund of the entire unutilised ITC and
the proviso only seeks to provide the condition and not to obliterate the
main provision. The better view is that the entitlement is created of the
quantum of refund by the main provision while the proviso only indicates
(xii)  The convergence of credit takes place at the stage of availing and not at
(xiii) The CGST Act contemplates that conditions and restrictions are two
(xiv) If the proviso was meant to deal with the quantum of refund, Parliament
would have separately carved out a substantive provision for zero rated
supplies and a separate provision for domestic supplies. Since that has
not been done, both cases derive their entitlement to refund of unutilised
(xv)   Section 54(3) is not akin to an exemption but is aimed at achieving tax
(xvi) Reliance on the decision of the nine judge Bench in Mafatlal Industries
Limited v. Union of India (supra) is out of context since what is being
claimed as a refund is not contrary to the statutory drill, but a refund
through an appropriate construction of the statute;
(xvii) The main submissions, in summation, are that:
(a)     The expression ‘input’ in the proviso if read contextually, and not by the
strict statutory definition, would cover both input goods and input
(b)     Grammatically ‘input’ covers labour and material and is opposite to
(c)     Use of the word “output supplies” as opposed to the defined expression
“outward supplies” (Section 2(83)) emphasises the legislative intent to
(d)     The substantive part of Section 54(3) should be construed to provide
for the quantum of refund of the entire basket of credit and the proviso
should be construed merely as a threshold condition that an “inverted
(e)     If the above propositions are not acceptable, there would be an
invidious discrimination between input goods and input services
(f)     The only way to save the provision in such a case is by (i) reading
down the word “input” in the proviso to include both goods and services
or (ii) interpreting the proviso as laying down conditions and the
quantum of refund being prescribed by the main part of Section 54(3);
or (iii) striking down/severing the offending portion;
(xviii) The doctrine of reading down the words of the statute to save its
constitutional validity also includes reading up. If two interpretations are
possible, the one which ensures that the provision is constitutionally valid
must be adopted. Even otherwise, if the phrase “on inputs being higher
than rate of tax on output supplies” is struck down, the impermissible
classification between input goods and input services can be severed,
thereby enlarging the class. Under such circumstances Section 54(3) as
“(3) Subject to provisions of Sub-section 10, a registered
person may claim refund of any unutilized input tax credit at
PROVIDED THAT no refund of unutilized input tax credit shall
(i)      Zero rated supplies made without payment of tax;
(ii)     Where the credit has accumulated on account of rate
of tax (other than nil rated or fully exempt supplies),
except supplies of goods or services or both as may
recommendations of the Council.”
(xix)   All registered persons demanding refund on account of inverted duty
structure for input goods and input services form a part of the same class
and seek equality of privileges in terms of Article 14:
i.       The class consists of all registered persons possessing unutilised
ITC whether or not they are engaged in domestic supplies or
ii.      The species consists of (i) exporters and (ii) domestic suppliers
where unutilised credit arises due to an inverted duty structure;
iii.     Discrimination inter se the species or sub-species of the same
class would be a class legislation which is hit by Article 14;
iv.      To form a part of the same class, the claimant’s position should be
substantially similar or in like circumstances, and conditions need
v.       In order to ascertain whether the persons are similarly placed one
must look beyond classification and into the purpose of the law.
(xx)    Goods and services, though defined separately, are treated substantially
in a similar manner in several aspects both in the Constitution and in the
(xxi)   In examining discriminatory treatment, it is the real effect of the provision
(a)      The real effect of the provision is to create an economy which does not
perpetuate a harmonized structure of GST or a harmonized national
market for goods and services, which is contrary to the constitutional
object of GST as provided in Article 279A(6); and
(b)     The effect that goods are tangible while services are intangible does
not bear any reasonable relation to the object of the legislation or to
Article 279A(6). According to the submission, equal laws in respect of
refunds of taxes in cases involving an inverted duty structure would
have to be applied to everyone in the same situation whether dealing in
input goods or input services. Since the purpose of GST is to achieve
tax neutrality, equivalence and anti-profiteering, their position is
substantially the same. The taxable event, person, measure of tax,
machinery, penal and prosecution provisions are substantially the
same. Hence the denial of the privilege of refund to input services is
arbitrary. The classification which is found to be valid in a given frame
of reference may be invalid in a different frame. From a revenue
harvesting perspective, goods and services may be treated as different.
However, from the perspective of neutrality and achieving a true
consumption tax, goods and services cannot be treated differently;
(xxii) The limitation on the power of judicial review of tax legislation on grounds
of ‘wide latitude’ is subject to exception. The submission is that after
treating tax on input goods and input services in an identical fashion by
granting credit (to achieve neutrality) and making the entire credit as a part
of homogeneous basket, granting refund to input goods and not to input
services (from that basket) is a colourable device to set at naught the
doctrine of neutrality. The State having reduced the rate of tax on output
supplies (leading to an inverted structure) the intent behind the refund was
to reduce the tax burden on the consumer. Denying refund on input
services would lead to an indirect impact on the very consumer that the
State wanted to benefit in the first place. Moreover, the State has made no
distinction between input goods and input services at the time of granting
credit, thereby declaring an intent to achieve tax neutrality. The denial of
refund on input services obliterates that intent and runs contrary to the
(xxiii) Denial of interest in the case of input services would be an unreasonable
restriction and would not be saved by Article 19(6).
16       Mr Arvind Datar, learned Senior Counsel19 urged the following submissions:
(i)      An interpretation of Section 54(3) first proviso (ii) which leads to
disallowance of credit on input services is impermissible as, firstly, Articles
269A and 279A introduced by the One Hundred and First Constitutional
Amendment seek to harmonise goods and services and remove the
cascading effect of taxes. Secondly, the Statement of objects and reasons
associated with the constitutional amendment and the Bill introducing the
CGST Act emphasised the need to treat goods and services as one
combined category. The concept of one nation one tax introduced by GST
laws cannot be ignored only at the time of refund;
(ii)     The proviso to Section 54(3) speaks only of categories of cases where
refund would be available. It does not speak of a restriction on the
quantum of refund. This is for the following reasons:
(a)    The quantum is determined by the main sub-section (3), which speaks
of “refund of any unutilised input tax credit”;
(b)    The first proviso employs the word “cases” [“no refund of unutilised
input tax credit shall be allowed in cases other than”] thus making it
clear that it only lists categories of cases, and does not deal with
(c)    The first proviso does not mention “credit to the extent of” or “credit of
an amount equal to” or any other such wording indicative of quantum;
(d)    Where the legislature intended to advert to the quantum, it has used the
words “amount claimed as refund” in the 4th proviso – such is not the
(e)    The second and third provisos too refer only to ‘cases’ – it is thus clear
that first, second and third provisos are intended to deal with cases and
are in nature of conditions, while it is only the fourth proviso which
adverts to the quantum and there again not to restrict the quantum but
only to refer to the amount claimed as refund under the main sub-
(f)     It has been the Union Government’s case that every word has been
carefully chosen in Section 54(3) first proviso (ii). It follows that where
the provision speaks the language of categories (i.e. ‘cases’) and not
the language of quantum (i.e. ‘amount’), it cannot be read as any
restriction of quantum.
(iii)     The word ‘inputs’ in the first proviso (ii) of Section 54(3) refers to the
aggregate of goods and services that are used in output supplies. In the
context of the first proviso (ii), the word ‘inputs’ has not been used to refer
only to input goods. The word employed in the proviso is “input(s)”
whereas definition of ‘input’ under Section 2(59) refers to goods alone;
(iv)      The accumulation (of ITC) is because the total GST on all the inputs
(goods or services or both) is more than the GST payable on the output
supplies. The reference is to all the inputs used to produce the output
(v)       The word “inputs” in Section 54(3) first proviso (ii) cannot be restricted to
goods because the CGST Act/ SGST Act treats goods as services. For
instance, transfer of right in goods without transfer of title is deemed as
“Supply of Services” as per Clause 1(b) of Schedule II, which reads as
“b.     any transfer of right in goods or of undivided share in
goods without the transfer of title thereof, is a supply of
services;”
(vi)    Similarly, “Works Contract” as defined in Section 2(119) of the CGST Act
is deemed as per Clause 6(a) of Schedule II as “Supply of Services”
although it involves the supply of goods. Section 2(119) and the relevant
“Section. 2(119) “works contract” means a contract for
building, construction, fabrication, completion, erection,
installation, fitting out, improvement, modification, repair,
maintenance, renovation, alteration or commissioning of any
immovable property wherein transfer of property in goods
(whether as goods or in some other form) is involved in the
execution of such contract”
The following composite supplies shall be treated as a supply
works contract as defined in clause (119) of section 2.”
(vii)   Further, Article 366(29A) of the Constitution, which provides for tax on sale
or purchase of goods and which treats six kinds of supplies as deemed
sales of goods, pertains to and is part of the erstwhile Entry 54 of List II
which deals only with goods. Article 366(29A) reads as follows:
“(29A) tax on the sale or purchase of goods includes
(a) a tax on the transfer, otherwise than in pursuance of a
contact, of property in any goods for cash, deferred
(b) a tax on the transfer of property in goods (whether as
goods or in some other form) invoked in the execution of
(c) a tax on the delivery of goods on hire purchase or any
(d) a tax on the transfer of the right to use any goods for any
purpose (whether or not for a specified period) for cash,
deferred payment or other valuable consideration;
(e) a tax on the supply of goods by any unincorporated
association or body of persons to a member thereof for
cash, deferred payment or other valuable consideration;
(f) a tax on the supply, by way of or as part of any service or
in any other manner whatsoever, of goods, being food or
any other article for human consumption or any drink
(whether or not intoxicating), where such supply or
service, is for cash, deferred payment or other valuable
consideration, and such transfer, delivery or supply of any
goods shall be deemed to be a sale of those goods by the
person making the transfer, delivery or supply and a
purchase of those goods by the person to whom such
transfer, delivery or supply is made;”
(viii) Chapter V (Section 16 to 21) of the CGST Act does not make any
distinction between credit of input tax on goods or services. Under Section
17 of the CGST Act, the input tax on both the goods and services used in
exempt supplies or other classes of supplies specified therein, are not
permitted to be availed as ITC. The remaining/ balance input tax is eligible
to be availed as ITC, which remains in the electronic credit ledger of the
taxpayer. After utilizing such ITC in terms of Section 49 of the CGST Act
(towards output GST on supply of goods or services or both), which too
makes no distinction between ITC accumulated on account of input goods
or input services, the balance is to be refunded in accordance with Section
54(3) of the Act. The relevant portion of Section 49 reads thus:
(6) The balance in the electronic cash ledger or electronic
credit ledger after payment of tax, interest, penalty, fee or any
other amount payable under this Act or the rules made
thereunder may be refunded in accordance with the
provisions of section 54”
(ix)     There is no distinction between ITC on goods or services either at the time
of availing or taking of the credit or at the time of utilization of credit.
Therefore, it could not have been the intention of the Parliament to
differentiate between the two only at the time of refund in the case of an
inverted duty structure envisaged under clause (ii) to the first proviso to
(x)      Without prejudice to the above submissions and assuming that the words
“inputs” means only input goods and not input services, it is stated that
even proceeding on the basis that the use of the words “on account of”
suggests the requirement of a causal relationship between the higher rate
of input goods and the accumulation of credit, once such a relationship is
present, then the entire accumulation is available as refund, rather than
just the portion relatable to input goods. To elaborate:
(a)     Parliament did not state “the credit has accumulated solely/only/entirely
on account of rate of tax on inputs being higher than the rate of tax on
(b)     Thus, all that is required is that there is accumulation and that the tax
on input goods is higher than the output supplies. If these two criteria
are met, it follows logically that at least some portion of the
accumulation would be on account of the higher rate of input services;
(c)     Thereupon, the entire accumulation would be available as refund in line
(xi)     The impugned notifications/delegated legislation, Notification No. 21/2018-
CT (amending Rule 89(5)) dated 18 April 2018 and Notification No.
26/2018 (retrospectively amending Rule 89(5)) dated 13 June 2018, by
disallowing the refund of ITC of tax on input services in an inverted duty
structure scenario is not only ultra vires Section 54(3) proviso but also
beyond the scope of powers of the delegate i.e. the Central Government,
because such a restriction is a typical policy change which could not have
been done through a delegated legislation.
17      Appearing on behalf of intervenor, Mr G Natarajan, in the course of his
submissions urged (for the purpose of his submissions) that he does not dispute the
position that under Section 54(3) read with rule 89(5), refund of ITC accumulating
only on account of “input goods” is eligible for refund and the credit accumulated on
input services is not entitled for refund. Based on this hypothesis, the submissions of
(i)      The formula which has been prescribed in Rule 89(5) seeks to identify the
quantum of ITC availed on inputs attributable to the outward supplies
having an inverted rate structure. From the quantum of ITC on inputs, the
tax payable by the supplier on the supplies having an inverted rated
structure is reduced to arrive at the quantum of the credit accumulating on
account of the inverted rate structure, which is available for refund;
(ii)     In the formula which is prescribed under Rule 89(5), while reducing the
“tax payable on such inverted rated supply of goods or services” the tax
payer should be allowed to first utilise the ITC accumulated on account of
input services, which is otherwise not eligible for refund;
(iii)    If the formula prescribed under Rule 89(5) is not read down in this manner,
it will lead to gross inequality between taxpayers having only inverted rated
supplies and taxpayers who also have other supplies; and
(iv)     The formula in Rule 89(5) should hence be read down by stipulating that
while calculating the refund entitlement as the difference between Net ITC
and tax payable on such supplies having inverted rated structure, the tax
payable after utilising the ITC availed on input services attributable to
inverted rate supplies for payment of the tax should be reckoned.
18       During the course of his oral submissions Mr Natarajan further elaborated on
(i)      Rule 89(5) suffers from the vice of treating unequals equally. This happens
because a discrimination results between assessees who have only
inverted rated supplies and those who have other supplies;
(ii)     ITC is available both on input goods and input services;
(iii)   At the end of every tax period, it is possible to note how much ITC has
arisen from input goods or input services. However, once a credit in the
electronic ledger is utilised, it is not possible to bifurcate what remains
(iv)    In the above backdrop, the manufacturer should be allowed to utilise the
ITC on input services first for the payment of taxes; and
(v)     The formula, as it stands, presumes that the outward tax liability is paid out
of the ITC accumulated only on account of input goods. Thus, what is
granted by the statute in Section 16 is indirectly taken away by the formula
prescribed in the rule. Thus, an order of utilization of credit should be
provided for payment of taxes to avail of credit on input services. In other
words, in the formula in Rule 89(5) the following words should be read in
at the end: “after utilising the input tax credit on input services pertaining to
such inverted rate supply of goods and services.”
19         Appearing for another intervenor20, Mr Shraff, learned Counsel submitted that-
(i)     If the Explanation (a) to Rule 89(5) is ultra vires Section 54(3), unutilised
ITC should include capital goods in addition to input goods and input
(ii)    The electronic ledger makes no distinction between input goods and input
services. The credit arises under integrated tax, central tax and state tax.
The electronic ledger represents a collective credit of input goods, input
(iii)    The inequality arises because small and medium enterprises (SMEs) with
one product, facing an inverted rate structure, would get a lesser amount
while availing refund whereas large companies with multiple products
would get refunds violating Article 19(1)(g); and
(iv)     The retrospective amendment to Rule 89(5) takes away vested or accrued
rights.
20         Mr Uchit Sheth, learned Counsel21 has urged the following submissions:
(i)      Once tax credit is claimed and credited into the electronic credit ledger, it
forms a consolidated pool of credit, making it impossible to segregate into
credit for input goods and credit for input services. Hence, it is not possible
to ascertain the source of unutilized ITC. The proviso to Section 54(3) only
lays down a condition precedent for claiming ITC and once the condition is
fulfilled, then refund is admissible on the entire amount of unutilized input
(ii)     The amended formula in Rule 89(5) stipulates maximum refund
permissible by deducting output tax from the Net ITC qua inputs goods. In
other words, it is presumed that output tax is first adjusted against ITC
pertaining to input goods and thereafter qua input services. There is no
basis for such hierarchy in utilization of tax credit and the anomaly arises
Appearing in SLP (Civil) Nos 2973 of 2021, 16003 of 2020, 677 of 2021 and 1340 of 2021
because of an incorrect interpretation of Section 54(3) of the Act by the
(iii) Section 49(6) of the Act provides that the balance in the electronic cash
ledger or electronic credit ledger after payment of tax, interest, penalty, fee
or any other amount payable is to be refunded in accordance with Section
54. The legal obligation is to refund the balance in the ledger if the
conditions specified in Section 54 are fulfilled. There is no legal basis for
the artificial dissection of such a balance;
(iv)  If the rate of tax on inputs is higher than the rate of tax on output supplies,
the entire unutilized ITC is “on account” of such circumstance and the
entire balance of tax credit is required to be refunded. The expression ‘on
account of’ cannot be read to mean ‘to the extent of’ particularly when it is
not possible to compute the unutilized ITC attributable to input goods or
(v)   There are two different connotations of the term ‘input’. The first
distinguishes it as goods vis-a-vis services while the second distinguishes
it from output. The expression ‘input tax’ and ‘input tax credit’ have been
defined to include tax in respect of both goods as well as services and
there is no phrase called “input service tax credit”. The expression ‘inputs’
in the proviso to Section 54(3) has been used in the second sense to
(vi)  GST is a destination-based consumption tax and the imposition of the tax
is on supply. A supplier is liable to pay tax only to the extent it is payable
on the output supply of goods or services and the refund of excess
balance of input of ITC under inverted duty structure is a means to achieve
this end. If the excess tax credit is not refunded, the tax liability of the
supplier will be in excess of the liability fixed by the charging section and
such interpretation should be avoided.
21       Dr Arvind Poddar, learned Counsel appearing on behalf of the respondents22,
urged that the respondents are in the business of providing dyeing and printing
services for textile industries. For job work operations, they procure input goods
(such as chemicals, stationeries and colours) and for providing outward supplies,
they also avail of input services such as contract labour, consultancies, repairs of
plants and machinery. The rate on outward supply of job work on textile fabrics is 5
per cent, while the rate on input goods and the rate on input services is 12 per cent
/18 per cent. Thus, most of the input goods and input services attract a higher rate of
GST compared to rate of GST applicable on the outward supply which is 5 per cent.
The inverted duty structure results where the rate of GST on inverted supplies is
higher than the outward supplies. As a result, over a period of time, credit gets
accumulated in the electronic credit ledger. In this backdrop, the following
(i)      Clause (ii) to the first proviso of Section 54(3) merely prescribes the
eligibility conditions subject to which a refund of unutilised ITC could be
made. The main part of Section 54(3) allows for a refund of any unutilised
ITC subject to the satisfaction of two conditions – either that the assessee
is making zero rated supplies without payment on taxes or where the
credit is getting accumulated on account of the rate of tax on inputs being
higher than the rate of tax on output supplies. Clause (ii) of the first proviso
merely prescribes a condition of eligibility subject to which refund of
(ii)  Rule 89(5) while providing a procedure for computing refund under Section
54(3) imposes an artificial restriction which has not been prescribed in the
main statute and is patently arbitrary and illegal. Section 49 allows credit
utilization irrespective of whether it is out of input goods or input services.
On the other hand, Rule 89(5) artificially restricts the credit by initiating the
formula under which duty can be paid out of credit on input goods and
input services only and hence the credit of input services will keep on
accumulating. Rule 89(5) must allow the taxpayers to utilise and make
payment through input services first and then the balance through credit
(iii) It is paradoxical that while on the one hand the definition of net ITC has
been amended to exclude ITC availed on input services, on the other
hand, turnover of inverted supply of services and tax payable on such
inverted rated supply of services has been included in the formula for
calculating the maximum amount of refund.
22     In response to the submissions of the assessees, Mr N Venkataraman, the
learned ASG, has submitted the following propositions:
(i)     The submission of the respondents that Article 279A(6) of the Constitution
mandates a harmonised structure of GST and obligates parity of treatment
amongst goods and services is misplaced for the following reasons:
(a)    Article 279A(6) does not compel parity of treatment between goods and
services. In fact, Article 366(12) deals with the definition of ‘goods’,
Article 366(26A) deals with the definition of ‘services’ and Article
366(12A) defines ‘goods and services’. Thus, goods and services are
(b)    Article 279A deals with the GST Council. The purpose of Article
279A(6) is to ensure that the GST Council, while discharging its
function, is guided by the need for a harmonised structure. Thus, the
term ‘harmonised’ or, harmony in this context would mean uniformity,
consistency, shared values and responsibilities between the Union
Government and State Governments. The essence of Article 279(A)(6)
(c)    If the interpretation of the respondents is accepted, it would render
Article 279A(4) otiose as it allows the GST Council to make
recommendations including rates and floor rates with bands of GST.
(ii)  Registered assessees having unutilised ITC do not form a distinct and
separate class. Unutilised ITC can accumulate on account of huge
discounts on output supplies of goods or services; as a business strategy
to indulge in predatory pricing; loss of business resulting in undervaluation
of goods; an Act of God; and inverted duty structure on account of inputs
or input services, among other reasons . Thus, although registered
assessees accumulating unutilised ITC constitute one category, it has
numerous species. Parliament is entitled to choose the species out of the
category and grant concessions or benefits. This would amount to treating
(iii) The doctrines of equivalence, neutrality or secondary stage cascading
effect are inapplicable and should not be used to read in grant of refund for
unutilised ITC on input services. Although the stated goal of the doctrines
may be convergence of a destination-based tax, policy issues as to how to
achieve the stated goal must be left to the discretion of the Union
Government and the State Governments. The level, type and time frame
to achieve a complete convergence is a policy issue which cannot be
(iv)  After the ITC on account of both inputs and input services is booked into
an electronic ledger, it forms a homogenous nucleus and the source of the
ITC (that is whether it arises from input or input services) cannot be
determined. Thus, the formula provided in Rule 89(5) is necessary to
(v)     Prior to the enactment of GST, MODVAT/CENVAT Rules contained
formulae to determine the quantum of eligibility of credit. Similarly, to
legally dissect the homogenous unutilised ITC, a formula may be resorted
to determine eligibility, restrictions, or refunds.
23       The idea which permeates GST legislation globally is to impose a multi stage
tax under which each point in a supply chain is potentially taxed. Suppliers are
entitled to avail credit of tax paid at an anterior stage. As a result, GST fulfils the
description of a tax which is based on value addition. Value addition is intended to
achieve fiscal neutrality and to obviate a cascading effect of taxation which
traditional tax regimes were liable to perpetuate. In a sense therefore, the purpose of
a tax on value addition is not dependent on the distribution or manufacturing model.
The tax which is paid at an anterior stage of the supply chain is adjusted. The
fundamental object is to achieve both neutrality and equivalence by the grant of
seamless credit of the duties paid at an anterior stage of the supply chain.
24       The State VAT legislation in India represented a significant stage in the
evaluation of fiscal legislation based on the principle of value addition. In All India
Federation of Tax Practitioners v. Union of India23, this Court, speaking through a
two judge Bench, noted the principle that VAT is a consumption tax as it is borne by
the consumer. The Court observed that with its increasing importance in the
economy, the service sector is “occupying the centre stage of the Indian economy”.
As economists postulate, there is no distinction between consumption of goods and
consumption of services both of which satisfy human wants and needs. The Court
underscored that service tax is a destination-based consumption tax, not a charge
on business but on the consumer of the service.
25     Though the erstwhile regime recognised the principle of value addition-based
consumption taxes, there was an absence of a seamless flow of credit, particularly
between Central and State levies. The background material antecedent to the
adoption of the constitutional and legal structure underlying GST in the country
indicates the importance which was ascribed to developing a tax regime which
would achieve a continuous chain of set-off from the original producer and service
provider’s point up to the retailer’s level in the supply chain and eliminate the burden
of cascading tax effects. Thus, the first discussion paper on GST in India published
by the Empowered Committee of State Finance Ministers on 10 November 2009
“1.14 … In the GST, both the cascading effects of CENVAT
and service tax are removed with set-off, and a continuous
chain of set-off from the original producer’s point and service
provider’s point upto the retailer’s level is established which
reduces the burden of all cascading effects. This is the
essence of GST, and this is why GST is not simply VAT plus
service tax but an improvement over the previous system of
VAT and disjointed service tax.”
26     The Statement of Objects and Reasons appended to the Constitution (One-
Hundred and Twenty-Second Amendment) Bill 2014 which eventually became the
Constitution (One Hundred and First Amendment) Act 2016 postulates that GST
shall replace a number of indirect taxes levied by the Union Government and the
State Governments. The object was to introduce a goods and service tax which
would fulfil two fiscal priorities namely, (1) removing the cascading effect of taxes;
and (2) providing for a common national market for goods and services. An extract
from the Statement of Objects and Reasons is set out below:
“The Constitution is proposed to be amended to introduce the
goods and services tax for conferring concurrent taxing
powers on the Union as well as the States including Union
territory with Legislature to make laws for levying goods and
services tax on every transaction of supply of goods or
services or both. The goods and services tax shall replace a
number of indirect taxes being levied by the Union and the
State Governments and is intended to remove cascading
effect of taxes and provide for a common national market for
goods and services. The proposed Central and State goods
and services tax will be levied on all transactions involving
supply of goods and services, except those which are kept
out of the purview of the goods and services tax.”
27     Now, it is in this backdrop that it becomes necessary to advert to the
constitutional amendment and the resulting legislation. The One Hundred and First
Amendment to the Constitution is a watershed moment in the evolution of
cooperative federalism. Since its origin, the Constitution contained a three-fold
distribution of legislative power. Under Article 246, the subjects of legislation
enumerated in the Union List of the Seventh Schedule were assigned to Parliament,
those in the State List were assigned exclusively to the States and those in the
Concurrent List were assigned both to Parliament and the States with precedence to
Parliament under the provisions of Article 254.
28      To illustrate, Entry 84 of the Union List provided for duties of excise on
tobacco and other goods manufactured or produced in India except – (a) alcoholic
liquors for human consumption; and (b) opium, hemp and other narcotic drugs and
narcotics. Entry 54 of the State List provided for taxes on sale or purchase of goods
other than newspapers subject to Entry 92A of the Union List which provided for
taxes on the sale or purchase of goods other than newspapers in the course of
interstate trade or commerce. Entry 97, the residual entry of the Union List
subsumed within it among other subjects, taxes not mentioned in the Union, State or
Concurrent List, thereby bringing with its ambit the notion of ‘rag-bag’ legislation.
The field contemplated by the erstwhile Entry 83 of the Union List (duties of customs
including export duties) or Entry 97 did not travel into the area of trading. State
legislation in the area of sales tax and VAT defined the ambit of the expression
‘inputs’, ‘capital goods’ and ‘input tax credit’.
29      The One Hundred and First Constitutional Amendment brought about a
significant merger by contemplating a fiscal umbrella comprehending GST. Article
246A was adopted in terms of which, notwithstanding anything contained in Article
246 and Article 254, Parliament and (subject to Clause (2)), the State Legislature of
every State have the power to make laws with respect to GST imposed by the Union
or by the State under clause (2) of Article 246A 24 . Parliament has the exclusive
power to make laws with respect to goods and services tax where the supply of
goods or of services, or both takes place in the course of inter-State trade or
commerce. With the enactment of the One Hundred and First Constitutional
Amendment, Entry 84 of the Union List has been restructured to incorporate duties
of excise on the following goods manufactured or produced in India, namely –
(c)        motor spirit (commonly known as petrol);
(f)        tobacco and tobacco products.
30         Entry 54 of the State List has been restructured to provide for taxes on the
sale of petroleum crude, high speed diesel, motor spirit (commonly known as
petrol), natural gas, aviation turbine fuel and alcoholic liquor for human consumption,
other than in the course of inter-State trade or commerce.
“Article 246A. (1) Notwithstanding anything contained in articles 246 and 254, Parliament, and, subject to clause
(2), the Legislature of every State, have power to make laws with respect to goods and services tax imposed by the
Union or by such State.
(2) Parliament has exclusive power to make laws with respect to goods and services tax where the supply of goods;
or of services, or both takes place in the course of inter-State trade or commerce.
Explanation. – The provisions of this article, shall, in respect of goods and services tax referred to in clause (5) of
article 279A, take effect from the date recommended by the Goods and Services Tax Council.”
31        Article 246A has brought about several changes in the constitutional scheme:
(i)       Firstly, Article 246A defines the source of power as well as the field of
legislation (with respect to goods and services tax) obviating the need to
(ii)      Secondly, the provisions of Article 246A are available both to Parliament
and the State legislatures, save and except for the exclusive power of
Parliament to enact GST legislation where the supply of goods or services
takes place in the course of inter-State trade or commerce; and
(iii)     Thirdly, Article 246A embodies the constitutional principle of simultaneous
levy as distinct from the principle of concurrence. Concurrence, which
operated within the fold of the Concurrent List, was regulated by Article
32        The    One     Hundred and First Constitutional Amendment brought in
amendments to the constitutional dictionary of definitions contained in Article 366.
Clause 12 of Article 366 contained a definition of the expression “goods” to include
all materials, commodities and articles. Clause 12A has been introduced by the
amendment to define “goods and services tax”:
“Clause (12A) “goods and services tax” means any tax on
supply of goods, or services or both except taxes on the
supply of the alcoholic liquor for human consumption”.
Clause 26A has been introduced to define “services”:
“Clause (26A) “Services” means anything other than goods”
‘Services’, therefore, under the constitutional scheme means anything other than
33     The constitutional scheme embodying GST is facilitated through the
composition of the GST Council under Article 279A. The GST Council is to consist of
the Union Finance Minister, the Union Minister of State in charge of Revenue of
Finance; and the Minister In-charge of Finance or Taxation or any other Minister
nominated by each State Government. Clause (4) of Article 279(A) empowers the
GST Council to make recommendations to the Union and the States on the aspects
comprehended in sub-clauses (a) to (h) of Clause (4), which are extracted below:
(a) the taxes, cesses and surcharges levied by the Union, the
States and the local bodies which may be subsumed in
(b) the goods and services that may be subjected to, or
(c) model Goods and Services Tax Laws, principles of levy,
apportionment of Goods and Services Tax levied on
supplies in the course of inter-State trade or commerce
under article 269A and the principles that govern the
(d) the threshold limit of turnover below which goods and
services may be exempted from goods and services tax;
(e) the rates including floor rates with bands of goods and
(f) any special rate or rates for a specified period, to raise
additional resources during any natural calamity or
(g) special provision with respect to the States of Arunachal
Pradesh, Assam, Jammu and Kashmir, Manipur,
(h) any other matter relating to the goods and services tax,
as the Council may decide.”
“(6) While discharging the functions conferred by this article,
the Goods and Services Tax Council shall be guided by the
need for a harmonised structure of goods and services tax
and for the development of a harmonised national market for
goods and services.”
34     Article 279A(6) indicates that in the discharge of its functions, the GST
Council is to be guided by the need for a harmonised structure of goods and
services tax and the development of a harmonised national market for goods and
services. This emphasis on harmony is crucial to co-operative federalism. It
underscores that in a federal arrangement where the States and Union are
converging together for the first time to adopt the same event for taxation, both sets
of partners must be guided by the over-arching need to preserve harmony. Harmony
postulates balance, an acceptance of mutual co-existence. Clauses (7) to (11) of
Article 279A contain provisions for quorum, procedure and voting. Clause (9) is a
clear indicator of the absence of supremacy either of the Union of the States. Under
sub clause (a) of Clause 9, the vote of the Union Government is to have a weightage
of one-third of the total votes cast, while the votes of all the State Governments
together are to have a weightage of two-thirds of the total votes cast. Every decision
of the Council is to be taken by a majority of not less than three-fourths of the
weighted votes of the members present and voting. The principle of harmony does
not postulate exact coincidence in all points of comparison or reference. Harmony is
a postulate of cooperative federalism and is founded on the principle of mutual co-
existence, deference and equality of the coexisting units.
35      While understanding the provisions of Section 54(3), it becomes necessary to
advert to some of the key definitions contained in the CGST Act.
Section 2 (52) defines the expression goods in the following terms:
“"goods” means every kind of movable property other than
money and securities but includes actionable claim, growing
crops, grass and things attached to or forming part of the land
which are agreed to be severed before supply or under a
contract of supply.”
36      The expression ‘goods’ is defined on the basis of a ‘means and includes’
formula. Following well-settled principles of statutory interpretation, the legislature
uses the expression ‘means’ when it intends the definition to be exhaustive. The use
of the expression ‘includes’ is intended to convey an expansive meaning. By using
the expression “means and includes”, the legislature intends to employ an extensive
definition, incorporating subjects which may not ordinarily fall within the common
understanding of the expression. Thus, the expression ‘goods’ is defined to mean
every kind of movable property other than money and securities. It also includes
certain other items incorporated in the inclusive part (“but includes”) of the definition.
The expression ‘goods’ is broadly defined. The expression ‘services’ is defined in
“Section 2(102) “services” means anything other than goods,
money and securities but includes activities relating to the use
of money or its conversion by cash or by any other mode,
from one form, currency or denomination, to another form,
currency or denomination for which a separate consideration
is charged.
Explanation: For the removal of doubts, it is hereby clarified
that the expression “services” includes facilitating or arranging
transactions in securities.”
The expression ‘services’ is thus distinguished from goods since the expression
means “anything other than goods”.
37      The definition of the expression ‘input’ is contained in Section 2(59) which
“2(59) “input” means any goods other than capital goods used
or intended to be used by a supplier in the course or
furtherance of business”
The expression ‘input’ is thus defined to mean goods other than capital goods. The
definition however, incorporates a requirement of use, actual or intended, by a
supplier or in the course or furtherance of business.
38      ‘Input service’ is defined in Section 2(60) as follows:
“input service” means any service used or intended to
be used by a supplier in the course or furtherance of
business;”
The definition of “input service” is parallel to that of “input”, with the important
distinction that while ‘input’ is defined with reference to “any goods”, ‘input service’ is
defined in relation to “any service”. Both sets of definitions incorporate the further
requirement of use or intended use by a supplier in the course or furtherance of
39      The expression “input tax” is defined in Section 2(62) :
“Input tax” in relation to a registered person, means the
Central tax, State tax, integrated tax or Union territory tax
charged on any supply of goods or services or both made to
(a) the integrated goods and services tax charged on
(b) the tax payable under the provisions of sub-sections
(c) the tax payable under the provisions of sub-sections
(3) and (4) of section 5 of the Integrated Goods and
(d) the tax payable under the provisions of sub-sections
(3) and (4) of section 9 of the respective State Goods and
(e) the tax payable under the provisions of sub-sections
(3) and (4) of section 7 of the Union Territory Goods and
but does not include the tax paid under the composition levy.”
The expression ‘input tax’ in relation to a registered person means (i) the Central,
State, Integrated or Union Territory tax; (ii) charged on any supply of goods or
services or both made to a registered person. This is followed by an inclusive
40      The expression ‘input tax credit’ is defined in Section 2 (63):
“2(63) “input tax credit” means the credit of input tax”
Evidently, since input tax credit means the credit on input tax, the definition of the
expression ‘input tax’ has to be read into Section 2(63) in understanding the ambit of
the expression ‘input tax credit’. Now, input tax is the tax charged on the supply of
goods or services or both. Apart from the above definitions there are three other
definitions which must be noted at this stage. The expression ‘inward supply’ is
defined in Section 2 (67) in the following terms:
“2(67) “inward supply” in relation to a person, shall mean
receipt of goods or services or both whether by purchase,
acquisition or any other means with or without consideration.”
41      The expression ‘output tax’ is defined in the following terms:
“2(82) “output tax” in relation to a taxable person, means the
tax chargeable under this Act on taxable supply of goods or
services or both made by him or by his agent but excludes tax
payable by him on reverse charge basis”
The expression ‘outward supply’ is defined in Section 2(83) thus:
“2(83) “outward supply” in relation to a taxable person, means
supply of goods or services or both, whether by sale, transfer,
barter, exchange, licence, rental, lease or disposal or any
other mode, made or agreed to be made by such person in
the course or furtherance of business.”
42      Again, as in the case of inward supply, the expression “outward supply”
incorporates the supply of goods or services or both. The expression “output tax” in
other words means tax chargeable under the Act on the taxable supply of goods or
services or both. The above definitions fall into three clusters: the first cluster relates
to receipt – Section 2(62), Section 2(63) and Section 2(67); the second cluster
consists of outward supply and output tax - Section 2(82) and Section 2(83); and the
third cluster consists of goods, services, input and input services – Section 2(52),
Section 2(102), Section 2(59) and Section 2(60).
43        Section 16 is comprised in Chapter V and is titled as ‘input tax credit’. The
marginal note to Section 16 indicates that the provision relates to eligibility and
conditions for taking ITC. Sub-Section (1) of Section 16 is in the following terms:
“16 Eligibility and conditions for taking input tax credit. – (1)
Every registered person shall, subject to such conditions and
restrictions as may be prescribed and in the manner specified
in section 49, be entitled to take credit of input tax charged on
any supply of goods or services or both to him which are used
or intended to be used in the course or furtherance of his
business and the said amount shall be credited to the
electronic credit ledger of such person.”
(i)      every registered person shall be entitled to take credit to input tax charged
on any supply of goods and services or both to him;
(ii)     which are used or intended to be used in the course or furtherance of his
(iii)    subject to such conditions and restrictions as may be prescribed; and
(iv)     in the manner specified in Section 49.
45        The amount of input tax credit is to be credited in the electronic credit ledger
of the registered person. Sub-Section (2) spells out the conditions upon the
fulfilment of which the entitlement to the credit of input tax in respect of any supply of
goods or services can be availed. Sub- Section (2) of Section 16 is in the following
(2) Notwithstanding anything contained in this section, no
registered person shall be entitled to the credit of any input
tax in respect of any supply of goods or services or both to
(a) he is in possession of a tax invoice or debit note issued by
a supplier registered under this Act, or such other tax paying
(aa) the details of the invoice or debit note referred to in
clause (a) has been furnished by the supplier in the statement
of outward supplies and such details have been
communicated to the recipient of such invoice or debit note in
(b)he has received the goods or services or both.
Explanation.—For the purposes of this clause, it shall be
deemed that the registered person has received the goods
(i) where the goods are delivered by the supplier to a
recipient or any other person on the direction of such
registered person, whether acting as an agent or
otherwise, before or during movement of goods, either by
way of transfer of documents of title to goods or otherwise;
(ii) where the services are provided by the supplier to any
person on the direction of and on account of such
registered person.
(c) subject to the provisions of section 41, the tax charged in
respect of such supply has been actually paid to the
Government, either in cash or through utilisation of input tax
credit admissible in respect of the said supply; and
(d) he has furnished the return under section 39:
Provided that where the goods against an invoice are
received in lots or instalments, the registered person shall
be entitled to take credit upon receipt of the last lot or
Provided further that where a recipient fails to pay to the
supplier of goods or services or both, other than the
supplies on which tax is payable on reverse charge basis,
the amount towards the value of supply along with tax
payable thereon within a period of one hundred and eighty
days from the date of issue of invoice by the supplier, an
amount equal to the input tax credit availed by the recipient
shall be added to his output tax liability, along with interest
thereon, in such manner as may be prescribed:
Provided also that the recipient shall be entitled to avail of
the credit of input tax on payment made by him of the
amount towards the value of supply of goods or services or
both along with tax payable thereon”
46     Section 16(2) indicates that the credit of input tax charged on any supply of
goods or services, or both, can be availed of by a registered person subject to the
conditions which are set out in the provisos. Input tax, as we have already seen, has
been defined in Section 2(62) as tax charged on any supply of goods or services or
both. The credit of input tax is, therefore, relatable both to the supply of goods and
services. Whether tax is paid on the supply of goods or services, the recipients
receive ITC in a similar manner. Taxes on goods and services are identifiable, but
upon credit to the electronic ledger they form a common pool for utilization. Section
16(1) indicates that the manner in which input tax credit can be utilized is spelt out in
Section 49. Sub- Section (1) of Section 49 provides:
“Section 49 (1) - Every deposit made towards tax, interest,
penalty, fee or any other amount by a person by internet
banking or by using credit or debit cards or National
Electronic Fund Transfer or Real Time Gross Settlement or
by such other mode and subject to such conditions and
restrictions as may be prescribed, shall be credited to the
electronic cash ledger of such person to be maintained in
such manner as may be prescribed...”
47     Sub-Section (3) of Section 49 envisages that the amount available in the
electronic cash ledger may be used for making any payment towards tax, interest,
penalty, fees or any other amount payable under the provisions of the Act or its rules
in the manner and subject to conditions and within such time as is prescribed.
Similarly, sub-Section (4) of Section 49 stipulates that the amount available in the
electronic credit ledger can be used for making payment towards output tax under
the CGST Act or under the IGST Act in such manner and subject to the conditions
and within such time as is prescribed. Sub-Section (5) of Section 49 spells out the
priorities according to which the amount of ITC available in the electronic credit
ledger can be utilized. Sub Section (6) of Section 49 is significant and provides as
“(6) The balance in the electronic cash ledger or electronic
credit ledger after payment of tax, interest, penalty, fee or any
other amount payable under this Act or the rules made
thereunder may be refunded in accordance with the
provisions of Section 54.”
48        The provisions of Section 16 and Section 49 indicate the following position:
(i)      The ITC in the electronic credit ledger may be availed of for making any
payment towards output tax under the CGST Act or under the IGST Act;
(ii)     The amount available in the electronic cash ledger may be used for
making any payment towards tax, interest, penalty, fees or any other
amount payable under the CGST Act or its rules;
(iii)    The balance in the electronic cash ledger or electronic credit ledger after
the payment of tax, interest, penalty, fees or any other amount payable
under the Act or rules may be refunded in accordance with the provisions
(iv)    Sub Section (6) of Section 49, in other words contemplates a refund of the
balance which remains in the electronic cash ledger or electronic credit
ledger in the manner stipulated by the provisions of Section 54.
F.3       Interpretation of Section 54(3) of the CGST Act
49        The controversy in the present case turns upon the interpretation of Section
54, which is found in Chapter XI titled as ‘Refunds’. The marginal note of Section 54
is titled “Refund of Tax”. Section 54(1) provides thus:
“54. (1) Any person claiming refund of any tax and interest, if
any, paid on such tax or any other amount paid by him, may
make an application before the expiry of two years from the
relevant date in such form and manner as may be prescribed:
Under sub-Section (1) of Section 54, an application has to be made within two years
of the relevant date by a person claiming refund of tax and interest (if any, paid on
the tax or any other amount paid), in such form and manner as prescribed.
Explanation 1 to Section 54 is in the following terms:
“Provided that a registered person, claiming refund of any
balance in the electronic cash ledger in accordance with the
provisions of sub-section (6) of section 49, may claim such
refund in the return furnished under section 39 in such
manner as may be prescribed.”
Sub-Section (3) of Section 54 is in the following terms:
“Subject to the provisions of sub-section (10), a registered
person may claim refund of any unutilised input tax credit at
Provided that no refund of unutilised input tax credit shall be
(i) zero rated supplies made without payment of tax;
(ii) where the credit has accumulated on account of rate of tax
on inputs being higher than the rate of tax on output supplies
(other than nil rated or fully exempt supplies), except supplies
of goods or services or both as may be notified by the
Government on the recommendations of the Council:
Provided further that no refund of unutilised input tax credit
shall be allowed in cases where the goods exported out of
Provided also that no refund of input tax credit shall be
allowed, if the supplier of goods or services or both avails of
drawback in respect of central tax or claims refund of the
integrated tax paid on such supplies.”
50     The submission which was urged by the assessees before the Gujarat and
Madras High Courts, as well as this Court, is that under the substantive part of
Section 54(3), Parliament has contemplated that the claim of refund may extend to
any unutilized ITC. ITC means credit of input tax and since ‘input tax’ is defined with
reference to the tax charged on the supply of goods or services or both, a refund
may be claimed not only of the tax charged on input goods but also input services as
a whole. According to the Revenue, the first proviso to Section 54(3) is a restriction.
On the other hand, assessees have urged that the first proviso sets out only a
condition or provision for eligibility and once it is fulfilled, the refund is available on
the entirety of the unutilized ITC including the credit which is relatable to tax paid on
input goods and input services.
51     The crux of the dispute in the present case pertains to how sub-Section (3) to
Section 54 and Explanation 1 to sub-Section (1) of Section 54 are to be understood
and interpreted. For convenience of analysis, the interpretation of sub-Section (3) of
Section 54 can be distributed in its main tier and the three provisos. The main part of
sub-Section (3) provides that a registered person may claim refund of any unutilized
ITC at the end of any tax period. Tax period is defined in Section 2(106) as the
period for which the return is required to be furnished. While enacting Section 54(3),
Parliament has envisaged a claim for the refund of unutilized ITC by a registered
person at the end of the tax period. The first tier is the main provision of Section
(iv)     At the end of any tax period, subject to the provisions of sub-Section (10).
52        The second tier is the first proviso. The first proviso begins with the
expression “no refund of unutilized ITC shall be allowed in cases other than” which
is followed by clauses (i) and (ii). The opening line of the first proviso contains two
expressions of significance, namely, “no refund shall be allowed” and “in cases other
than”. The expression ‘allowed’ in the proviso must be contrasted with the
expression ‘claim’ in the substantive part of sub-Section (3). A refund can be allowed
only in the eventualities envisaged in clauses (i) and (ii). The expression ‘other than’
operates as a limitation or restriction.
53        The third tier of sub-Section 54(3) consist of the two clauses of the first
proviso which deal with two distinct cases: Clause (i) deals with zero-rated supplies
made without payment of tax, while Clause (ii) deals with credit which has
accumulated on account of the rate of tax on inputs being higher than the rate of tax
on output supplies. Proviso (ii) embodies the concept of an inverted duty structure.
Proviso (ii) states that the refund of unutilized ITC shall be allowed only when the
credit has accumulated because the rate of tax of inputs is higher than the rate of
tax on output supplies. Input, as we have already noted, is defined in Section 2(59)
to mean goods other than the capital goods. ‘Output supplies’ is not defined in
the statute. As seen above, Section 16 stipulates the eligibility and conditions for
availing ITC. ITC accumulates when the credit cannot be utilized either partly or in
whole and this may occur for a variety of reasons. The credit of ITC may accumulate
for several reasons. Without spelling out an exhaustive list of circumstances, the
accumulation may be due to: (a) an inverted duty structure when the GST on output
supplies is less than the GST on inputs; (b) stock accumulation; (c) capital goods;
and (d) partial reverse mechanism for certain services. There could be other
reasons as well, such as excessive discounts or predatory pricing.
54     The distortion caused by unutilized accumulated ITC was noticed before the
advent of the GST regime, in the context of the State VAT legislation under the
erstwhile regime. A White Paper on State-level Value Added Tax by the Empowered
Committee of State Finance Ministers dated 17 January 2005 contemplated that if
any credit remained unutilized in a month, it will be carried forward. If even at the
end of second year there is an excess unadjusted ITC, the same will be refunded:
2.4 If the tax credit exceeds the tax payable on sales in a
month, the excess credit will be carried over to the end of
next financial year. If there is any excess unadjusted input tax
credit at the end of second year, then the same will be eligible
for refund….”
Based on this, a provision for refund of unadjusted ITC was inserted in Section 11 of
the Gujarat Value Added Tax Act read with Rule 15(6) of the Gujarat Value Added
Tax Rules 200625. When the GST regime was under discussion, the first discussion
paper by the Empowered Committee of State Finance Ministers published on 10
November 2009 acknowledged the problem of the accumulation of ITC on account
of the rate of input tax being higher than output tax and suggested that a refund be
provided of accumulated ITC. The relevant extract from the discussion paper dealing
with the ‘Salient features of the GST model’ reads thus:
“3.2…(vi) Ideally, the problem related to credit accumulation
on account of refund of GST should be avoided by both the
Centre and the States except in the cases such as exports,
purchase of capital goods, input tax at higher rate than output
tax etc. where, again refund/adjustment should be completed
in a time bound manner.”
“(6) Where the tax credit (other than tax credit on capital goods) admissible in the year remains unadjusted against
the output tax as per section 11, such amount shall be refunded not later than expiry of two years from the end of the
year in which such tax credit had become admissible:
Provided that the dealer claiming such refund shall have to prove to the satisfaction of the assessing authority that
the purchases of the goods on which such tax credit had been calculated have been disposed off in the manner
referred to in sub-section (3) of section 11 within the period by which refund under this sub-rule becomes admissible.”
See also, Section 51 of the Maharashtra Value Added Tax Act 2002 read with Rule 60 of the Maharashtra Value
55     The report of the Joint Committee, Empowered Committee of State Finance
Ministers on Business Process for GST and on Refund Process published in August
2015 noted that under the proposed GST law, ITC will be allowed, so as to remove
the cascading effect of taxes and it is the ultimate customer who should bear the
burden of taxes. However, the report noticed that there can be cases where there is
an accumulation of credit due to an inverted duty structure. The report envisaged
that there would fewer rates of taxes and exemptions under GST and hence, the
chances of an inverted duty structure would be “minimal”. At the same time, it
recommended a refund of carried forward ITC in the following terms:
i) As stated earlier, ITC is allowed to remove cascading and
under modern VAT laws, tax is charged on value addition
only and tax is not charged on tax. It is for this reason that the
ultimate consumer is liable to bear the tax burden.
ii) It is noted that the ITC may accumulate on account of the
a) Inverted Duty Structure i.e. GST on output
supplies is less than the GST on the input supplies;
d) Partial Reverse charge mechanism for certain
services.
iii) As regards the accumulated ITC attributed to accumulation
of stock or capital goods, it is recommended that GST Law
may provide that refund of carried forward ITC may not be
allowed and such amount would be carried forward to the
next tax period (s). The GST Law may provide for appropriate
provisions in this regard.
iv) Under the proposed GST law, it is proposed to have
fewer tax rates and fewer exemptions and therefore it is
felt that chances of inverted duty structure would not be
there or would be very minimal. But still there might be a
possibility that ITC may accumulate on account of
inverted duty structure.
v) It is recommended that in such case, cash refund may
be granted after due audit and should be sanctioned only
after the input tax credit has been matched from the
purchase and sales statements filed along with monthly
returns. The refund would be granted on submission of
application. It may be mentioned, however, that presently
the Centre does not grant refund in such cases.…”
While enacting Clause (ii) of the first proviso to Section 54(3) in the CGST Act,
Parliament, took legislative notice of a specific eventuality namely “where the credit
has accumulated on account of the rate of tax on inputs being higher than the rate of
tax on output supplies”. Parliament would be cognizant of the fact that ITC may
accumulate for a variety of reasons, of which an inverted duty structure is one
situation. Parliament was legislating to provide for a refund and therefore restricted
it to the two situations spelt out in clauses (i) and (ii) of the first proviso. The opening
words of the substantive part of Section 54(3) contemplate a claim of refund of
“any unutilized input tax credit”. Undoubtedly, any unutilized ITC would include credit
on account of tax charged on any supply of goods or services or both. The opening
sentence of Section 54(3) provides for (i) a claim of refund by a registered person;
(ii) of any unutilized input tax credit; (iii) at the end of any tax period. But the impact
of the first proviso, as its opening words indicate, is that :
(i)    “No refund” of unutilized ITC “shall be allowed” “in cases other than” (i)
(ii)  The expression “claim” in the substantive part must be distinguished from
the phrase “shall be allowed” in the opening sentence of the first proviso.
Likewise, the expression “may claim refund” in the opening part must be
distinguished from “no refund” in the opening part of the first proviso;
(iii) The impact of the first proviso is that a refund of unutilized ITC shall be
allowed only in cases falling under (i) and (ii). The expression ‘only’ in the
previous sentence is not a judicial addition to statutory language but
follows plainly from the expressions “no refund” of unutilized ITC shall be
(iv)  The expression “in cases other than” is a clear indicator that clauses (i)
and (ii) are restrictive and not conditions of eligibility. A refund, in other
words, can be allowed in the two contingencies spelt out in clauses (i) and
(v)   There is a clear distinction between clause (i) and clause (ii) of the first
proviso: (a) in the case of exports, the contingency is zero-rated supplies
without any distinction between input goods or input services; (b) in
contrast for domestic supplies, clause (ii) relates to the accumulation of
credit on account of rate of tax on inputs being higher than the rate of tax
(vi)  The legislative draftsperson has made a clear distinction between clause
(i) and clause (ii) of the first proviso and it was in this context that the
opening words of Section 54(3) have used the expression “may claim
(vii)   Explanation 1 to Section 54, while defining the expression “refund” for the
purposes of the section adopts an inclusive definition covering (a) refund
of tax paid on zero rated supplies of goods or services or both; (b) refund
of tax paid on input goods or inputs services used in making such zero-
rated supplies; (c) refund of tax on supply of goods regarded as deemed
exports; and (d) refund of unutilized ITC as provided under sub-section(3)
(viii)  Explanation 1 indicates that with reference to exports, the legislature has
brought within its fold ITC on input goods and input services. In contrast, in
the case of domestic supplies it has contemplated refund of unutilized ITC
“as provided under sub-section(3)”. The Explanation is a clear indicator
that in respect of domestic supplies, it is only unutilized credit which has
accumulated on the rate of tax on input goods being higher than the rate of
output supplies of which a refund can be allowed. Clause (ii) of the first
proviso in other words is a restriction and not a mere condition of eligibility.
56       The fulcrum of the argument of the assessees before the Gujarat and Madras
High Courts and before this Court is that clause (ii) of the first proviso prescribes a
condition of eligibility and not a restriction on the entitlement to refund. The entire
basket of unutilized ITC, whether traceable to goods or services, is in the
submission, eligible for refund. This submission has been made before the Court on
three planes. The first plane on which the submission has been urged is that the
purpose of enacting Section 54(3) was to ensure against a cascading effect or
‘sticking’ inputs tax. According to the assesses, the GST regime is a result of a long-
standing exercise of legislative preparation in the doctrine of equivalence and tax
neutrality. According to the submission, the doctrine of equivalence postulated an
equivalence between goods and services in the VAT regime, which must a fortiori be
so under the auspices of a unified GST legislation which contemplates that
businesses are only pass-through entities. The second plane of the submission is
that the function of the GST Council, as specified in Article 279A(6), is that it is to be
guided by the need for a harmonized structure of GST and a harmonized national
market for goods and services. Clause (12A) of Article 366 provides for the levy of
GST on both- goods and services. In this context, it was urged that in any fiscal
regime, there are five essential components comprising of (a) taxable events; (b)
taxable persons; (c) measure of tax; and (d) rate of tax; and (e) administrative
machinery. In all these, it is urged that the CGST makes absolutely no distinction
between goods and services. Section 16 which provides for the utilization of ITC
makes no distinction between goods and services. The pale of the law, it was urged,
applies substantive provisions similarly in the case of goods as well as services
except as regard rates. But as regards rates, it was urged that even within the
category of goods, the rates may or do vary. The legislature, for the first time,
introduced anti-profiteering provisions based on the precept that a reduction in the
rate of tax must be passed on to the consumer. When neutrality was not intended,
as in the case of Section 17(5), a specific provision has been made by the
legislature where the ITC cannot be availed of in those cases. Once the threshold of
Section 17(5) is crossed, tax neutrality must, in their submission, be achieved.
Finally, it was also urged that an inverted duty structure arises in many cases where
the rate of tax on output supplies is reduced in order to fulfil certain objectives
guided by public interest such as encouraging infrastructure development. In this
backdrop, it was submitted that where the reduction of the rate of tax on outward
supplies is in pursuance of the policy of the State, the ultimate object of achieving
tax neutrality must be given full effect by fully effectuating a refund under Section
54(3) by allowing a refund of unutilized ITC, whether relatable to goods or services.
57       The submission based on the doctrine of equivalence places reliance on the
decision of a three judge Bench of this Court in Association of Leasing and
Financial Service Companies v. Union of India 26 . Chief Justice S H Kapadia,
speaking for a three judge Bench, dealt with the validity of the provisions of Sections
65(12) and 65(105) (zm) of the Finance Act 1994, in so far as the said provisions
sought to levy service tax on leasing and hire purchase. The levy of service tax on
financial leasing services was challenged as being beyond the competence of
Parliament by virtue of Article 366(29A) of the Constitution. While construing the
issue, the Court adverted to the decision in All India Federation of Tax
“Service tax is an economic concept based on the principle of
equivalence in a sense that consumption of goods and
consumption of services are similar as they both satisfy
human needs. Today with the technological advancement
there is a very thin line which divides a “sale” from “service”.
That, applying the principle of equivalence, there is no
difference between production or manufacture of saleable
goods and production of marketable/saleable services in the
form of an activity undertaken by the service provider for
consideration, which correspondingly stands consumed by
the service receiver. It is this principle of equivalence which is
inbuilt into the concept of service tax under the Finance Act,
1994. That service tax is, therefore, a tax on an activity. That,
service tax is a value added tax. The value addition is on
account of the activity which provides value addition, for
example, an activity undertaken by a chartered accountant or
a broker is an activity undertaken by him based on his
performance and skill. This is from the point of view of the
professional. However, from the point of view of his client, the
chartered accountant/broker is his service provider. The value
addition comes in on account of the activity undertaken by the
professional like tax planning, advising, consultation, etc. It
gives value addition to the goods manufactured or produced
or sold. Thus, service tax is imposed every time service is
rendered to the customer/client. This is clear from the
provisions of Section 65(105)(zm) of the Finance Act, 1994.”
58     The above formulation of the doctrine of equivalence dwelt on the economic
rationale underlying the enactment of service tax. The economic rationale is based
on the equivalence of goods and services, both of which are instruments for the
satisfaction of human needs. The principle recognizes that there is, in economic
terms, an equivalence between production or manufacture of saleable goods and
production of marketable and saleable services. The issue before this Court,
however, is whether an a priori equivalence between goods and services for the
purpose of bringing both within a composite tax regime must result in the conclusion
that a refund of unutilized ITC must be made available to both - input goods as well
as input services, disregarding the provision which has been inserted by the
legislature in the present case in the form of Section 54(3). The answer to this is
clear. The Court while interpreting the provisions of Section 54(3) must give effect to
its plain terms. The Court cannot redraw legislative boundaries on the basis of an
ideal which the law was intended to pursue.
59      Sub-Section (6) of Article 279A has provided that while discharging its
functions the GST Council shall be guided by the need for (a) a harmonised
structure of goods and service tax; and (b) the development of a harmonised
national market for goods and services. In emphasizing the need, the constitutional
provision reflects a goal, object and aspiration to be achieved. By emphasizing this,
the provision underscores the vision that the GST Council should bear in mind in the
discharge of its constitutional functions. The constitutional object is however to be
realized under the auspices of legislation duly enacted under the provisions of
Article 246A. The GST Council is intended to function towards the advancement of a
harmonised structure for GST and market for goods and services. Contemporary
doctrine would suggest that these objects of the fiscal regime may be furthered by
bearing in mind (i) the doctrine of equivalence; (ii) the doctrine of neutrality; and (iii)
the need of obviating secondary stage cascading effects. The realpolitik of tax policy
and governance in the real world may not always match up to ideals. In an ideal tax
regime, with a uniform rate of taxes on inputs goods, input services and outward
supplies, the chance of accumulating unutilized ITC as a result of an inverted rate
structure would be minimal. An inverted duty structure arises where the rate of tax
on inputs exceeds the rate of tax on output supplies as a result of which the
unutilized ITC may get accumulated. The jurisprudential material which has been
relied upon by the assesses portrays an ideal state of GST legislation. In the well-
known treatise on VAT, Alan Schenk and Oliver Oldman27 explained the principled
basis in VAT/GST legislation for the grant of refund of excess input tax credit.
“II. Treatment of Excess Input Credits –Carry Forward, Offset,
As was discussed earlier and will be discussed in detail in
Chapter 7, most countries define the jurisdictional reach of
their VATs under the destination principle. Applying the
destination principle, exports are free of tax (zero rated).
As a result, exporters commonly report excess input VAT
in their periodic VAT returns. In addition, even registered
persons making sales taxable at a positive rate may
experience occasional excess input VATs, such as when
they make capital purchases generating substantial input
credits or when they increase their inventory as part of
an expansion of their businesses.
There is an implicit assumption in VAT systems that
registered persons will recover input VAT used in making
taxable sales so that the input VAT does not enter into the
pricing structure for those sales. To accomplish that goal, a
normative or well-structured VAT must grant registered
persons the right to recover excess input VATs within a
reasonable period of time after incurring the input t(a)x (sic).
In the EU, the Sixth Directive provides that if there are excess
input tax deductions, “Member States may either make a
refund or carry the excess forward to the following period
according to conditions which they shall determine. For
Member States, excess credits must be refunded after being
carried forward six months. However, Member States may
refuse to refund or carry forward if the amount of the excess
is insignificant…”
Alan Schenk and Oliver Oldman, VALUE ADDED TAX: A COMPARATIVE APPROACH (Cambridge Tax Law Series, 2007)
60     The jurisprudential basis furnishes a depiction of an ideal state of existence of
GST legislation within the purview of a modern economy, as a destination-based
tax. But there can be no gain saying the fact that fiscal legislation around the world,
India being no exception, makes complex balances founded upon socio-economic
complexities and diversities which permeate each society. The form which a GST
legislation in a unitary State may take will vary considerably from its avatar in a
nation such as India where a dual system of GST law operates within the context of
a federal structure. The ideal of a GST framework which Article 279A(6) embodies
has to be progressively realized. The doctrines which have been emphasized by
Counsel during the course of the arguments furnish the underlying rationale for the
enactment of the law but cannot furnish either a valid basis for judicial review of the
legislation or make out a ground for invalidating a validly enacted law unless it
infringes constitutional parameters. While adopting the constitutional framework of a
GST regime, Parliament in the exercise of its constituent power has had to make
and draw balances to accommodate the interests of the States. Taxes on alcohol for
human consumption and stamp duties provide a significant part of the revenues of
the States. Complex balances have had to be drawn so as to accommodate the
concerns of the states before bringing them within the umbrella of GST. These
aspects must be borne in mind while assessing the jurisprudential vision and the
economic rationale for GST legislation. But abstract doctrine cannot be a ground for
the Court to undertake the task of redrawing the text or context of a statutory
provision. This is clearly an area of law where judicial interpretation cannot be ahead
of policy making. Fiscal policy ought not be dictated through the judgments of the
High Courts or this Court. For it is not the function of the Court in the fiscal arena to
compel Parliament to go further and to do more by, for instance, expanding the
coverage of the legislation (to liquor, stamp duty and petroleum) or to bring in
uniformity of rates. This would constitute an impermissible judicial encroachment on
legislative power. Likewise, when the first proviso to Section 54(3) has provided for a
restriction on the entitlement to refund it would be impermissible for the Court to
redraw the boundaries or to expand the provision for refund beyond what the
legislature has provided. If the legislature has intended that the equivalence
between goods and services should be progressively realized and that for the
purpose of determining whether refund should be provided, a restriction of the kind
which has been imposed in clause (ii) of the proviso should be enacted, it lies within
the realm of policy.
61      The submission which has been urged on behalf of the assessees is that
registered persons constitute a class within the meaning of sub-Section (3) of
Section 54 and each of them is entitled to claim a refund of unutilized ITC whether
its origin lies in input goods or input services. In other words, it has been urged that
Section 54(3) constitutes one homogenous class of registered persons who have
unutilized ITC. The fallacy of the argument is in the hypothesis that unutilized ITC
cannot be unbundled for the purpose of fiscal legislation. Accumulated ITC may
result due to a variety of circumstances, some of which may while others may not lie
within the volition of a registered person. We have referred to some of these factors
(v)      Economic compulsion to sell at below value prices; and
(vi)     Stoppage of work.
62        These examples are indicators that the class, comprising of registered
persons with unutilized ITC, covers a bundle of species as opposed to one unique or
homogenous specie. Once we recognize this, it is necessary to allow the legislature
the latitude to distinguish between credits arising out of the input goods stream and
input service stream. GST legislation in India is the product of hard constitutional
and legislative work which stretched over several decades. Our fiscal regime is yet
to arrive at an ideological position of one bundle for goods and services based on a
single rate structure. Broadly speaking, goods and services are taxed at 5 per cent,
12 per cent, 18 per cent and 40 per cent. As on date, there is an absence of
uniformity in rates and it is the multiplicity of rates which has given rise to an inverted
duty structure. Registered persons with unutilized ITC may conceivably form one
class but it is not possible to ignore that this class consists of species of different
hues. Given these intrinsic complexities, the legislature has to draw the balance
when it decides upon granting a refund of accumulated ITC which has remained
unutilized. In doing so, Parliament while enacting sub-Section (3) of Section 54 has
stipulated that no refund of unutilized ITC shall be allowed other than in the two
specific situations envisaged in clauses (i) and (ii) of the first proviso. Whereas
clause (i) has dealt with zero rated supplies made without the payment of tax, clause
(ii), which governs domestic supplies, has envisaged a more restricted ambit where
the credit has accumulated on account of the rate of tax on inputs being higher than
the rate of tax on output supplies. While the CGST Act defines the expression ‘input’
in Section 2(59) by bracketing it with goods other than capital goods, it is true that
the plural expression ‘inputs’ has not been specifically defined. But there is no
reason why the ordinary principle of construing the plural in the same plane as the
singular should not be applied. To construe ‘inputs’ so as to include both input goods
and input services would do violence to the provisions of Section 54(3) and would
run contrary to the terms of Explanation-I which have been noted earlier.
Consequently, it is not open to the Court to accept the argument of the assessee
that in the process of construing Section 54(3) contextually, the Court should
broaden the expression ‘inputs’ to cover both goods and services.
63        Provisos in a statute have multi-faceted personalities. As interpretational
principles governing statutes have evolved, certain basic ideas have been
recognized, while heeding to the text and context. Justice GP Singh, in his seminal
text, Principles of Statutory Interpretation 28 formulates the governing principles of
interpretation which have been adopted by courts while construing a statutory
proviso. The first rule of interpretation is that:
“The normal function of a proviso is to except something
out of the enactment or to qualify something enacted
therein which but for the proviso would be within the
purview of the enactment. As stated by LUSH, J.: “When
one finds a proviso to a section the natural presumption is
that, but for the proviso, the enacting part of the section would
have included the subject- matter of the proviso. In the words
of LORD MACMILLAN: “The proper function of a proviso is to
except and to deal with a case which would otherwise fall
within the general language of the main enactment and its
effect is confined to that case.” The proviso may, as LORD
MACNAGHTEN laid down, be “a qualification of the
preceeding enactment which is expressed in terms too
general to be quite accurate”. The general rule has been
stated by HIDAYATULLAH, J., in the following words: “As a
general rule, a proviso is added to an enactment to qualify or
create an exception to what is in the enactment, and
ordinarily, a proviso is not interpreted as stating a general
rule”. And in the words of KAPUR, J.: “The proper function of
a proviso is that it qualifies the generality of the main
enactment by providing an exception and taking out as it
were, from the main enactment, a portion which, but for the
proviso would fall within the main enactment.”29
64        But then these principles are subject to other principles of statutory
interpretation which may supplement or even substitute the above formula. These
other rules which have been categorized by Justice GP Singh are summarized as
(i)    A proviso is not construed as excluding or adding something by
“Except as to cases dealt with by it, a proviso has no
repercussion on the interpretation of the enacting portion of
the section so as to exclude something by implication which is
embraced by clear words in the enactment.”30
(ii)      A proviso is construed in relation to the subject matter of the statutory
“The language of a proviso even if general is normally to be
construed in relation to the subject-matter covered by the
section to which the proviso is appended. In other words
normally a proviso does not travel beyond the provision to
which it is a proviso. “It is a cardinal rule of interpretation”,
observed BHAGWATI, J., “that a proviso to a particular
provision of a statute only embraces the field which is
covered by the main provision. It carves out an exception to
the main provision to which it has been enacted as a proviso
(iii)     Where the substantive provision of a statute lacks clarity, a proviso may
“If the enacting portion of a section is not clear, a proviso
appended to it may give an indication as its true meaning. As
stated by LORD HERSCHELL: “ Of course a proviso may be
used to guide you in the selection of one or other of two
possible constructions of the words to be found in the
enactment, and show when there is doubt about its scope,
when it may reasonably admit of doubt as to having this
scope or that, which is the proper view to take of it.”32
(iv)      An effort should be made while construing a statute to give meaning both
to the main enactment and its proviso bearing in mind that sometimes a
proviso is inserted as a matter of abundant caution:
“The general rule in construing an enactment containing a
proviso is to construe them together without making either of
them redundant or otiose. Even if the enacting part is clear
effort is to be made to give some meaning to the proviso and
to justify its necessity. But a clause or a section worded as a
proviso, may not be a true proviso and may have been placed
(v)       While ordinarily, it would be unusual to interpret the proviso as an
independent enacting clause, as distinct from its main enactment, this is
true only of a real proviso and the draftsperson of the statute may have
intended for the proviso to be, in substance, a fresh enactment:
“To read a proviso as providing something by way of an
addendum or as dealing with a subject not covered by the
main enactment or as stating a general rule as distinguished
from an exception or qualification is ordinarily foreign to the
proper function of a proviso. However, this is only true of a
real proviso. The insertion of a proviso by the draftsman has
not always strictly adhered to its legitimate use and at times a
section worded as a proviso may wholly or partly be in
substance a fresh enactment adding to and not merely
excepting something out of or qualifying what goes before.”34
65         Perhaps the most comprehensive and oft-cited precedent governing the
interpretation of a proviso is the decision of this Court in S Sundaram Pillai v. V R
Pattabiraman35. Justice S Murtaza Fazal Ali speaking for a three judge Bench of
“43. …To sum up, a proviso may serve four different
(1) qualifying or excepting certain provisions from the main
(2) it may entirely change the very concept of the intendment
of the enactment by insisting on certain mandatory conditions
to be fulfilled in order to make the enactment workable:
(3) it may be so embedded in the Act itself as to become an
integral part of the enactment and thus acquire the tenor and
colour of the substantive enactment itself; and
(4) it may be used merely to act as an optional addenda to
the enactment with the sole object of explaining the real
intendment of the statutory provision.”
66       While enunciating the above principles, S Sundaram Pillai (supra) took note
of the decision in Hiralal Rattanlal v. State of UP 36 where Justice KS Hegde,
speaking for a four judge Bench of this Court observed that while ordinarily, a
proviso is in the nature of an exception, the precedents indicate that sometimes a
proviso is in the nature of a separate provision, with a life of its own. The Court held:
“22… Ordinarily a proviso to a section is intended to take out
a part of the main section for special treatment. It is not
expected to enlarge the scope of the main section. But cases
have arisen in which this Court has held that despite the fact
that a provision is called a proviso, it is really a separate
provision and the so-called proviso has substantially altered
the main section. In CIT v. Bipinchandra Maganlal & Co. Ltd.,
ITR 290] this Court held that by the fiction in Section 10(2)(vii)
second proviso read with Section 2(6-C) of the Indian Income
Tax Act, 1922 what is really not income is, for the purpose of
computation of assessable income, made taxable income.”
Besides the decision in CIT v. Bipinchandra Maganlal 37 , the Court in Hiralal
Rattanlal (supra) adverted to the earlier decisions in State of Rajasthan v. Leela
Jain38 and Bihar Cooperative Development Cane Marketing Union Ltd. v. Bank
67         In their effort to persuade this Court to accept the submission that the first
proviso to Section 54(3) is in the nature of an eligibility condition as distinct from a
restriction on the substantive part (contained in the opening words) of the provision,
Counsel appearing on behalf of the assessees have sought to buttress their
(i)       Clause (ii) of the first proviso refers to “rate of tax” as distinct from the
(ii)      The expression “in cases other than where…” adverts to situations or
(iii)     The expression “on account of” would mean “due to”;
(iv)      The use of the expression ‘inputs’ (the singular being defined in Section
2(59) but not the plural) and the corresponding use of the expression
“output supplies” (which is not defined, though “outward supply” is defined
(v)       Section 54(8) and Section 49(6) provide that the balance in the electronic
credit ledger is to be refunded and makes no distinction between a credit
(vi)      The expression “on account of” has been used in Section 22(3) and
Section 18(3) and is distinct from the use of the expression “to the extent
of” in Section 23(1)(b) and the proviso to Section 12(2). “To the extent of”
is a limiting expression and has a distinct connotation from “on account of”;
(vii)     The Ministry of Finance has issued a circular dated 31 December 2018 40
“4. Representations have been received stating that while
processing the refund of unutilized ITC on account of inverted
tax structure, the departmental officers are denying the refund
of ITC of GST paid on those inputs which are procured at
equal or lower rate of GST than the rate of GST on outward
supply, by not including the amount of such ITC while
calculating the maximum refund amount as specified in rule
89(5) of the CGST Rules. The matter has been examined and
a) Refund of unutilized ITC in case of inverted tax structure,
as provided in section 54(3) of the CGST Act, is available
where ITC remains unutilized even after setting off of
available ITC for the payment of output tax liability. Where
there are multiple inputs attracting different rates of tax, in
the formula provided in rule 89(5) of the CGST Rules, the
term “Net ITC‟ covers the ITC availed on all inputs in the
relevant period, irrespective of their rate of tax.
b) The calculation of refund of accumulated ITC on account
of inverted tax structure, in cases where several inputs
are used in supplying the final product/output, can be
clearly understood with help of the following example:
i.       Suppose a manufacturing process involves the use of
an input A (attracting 5 per cent GST) and input B
(attracting 18 per cent GST) to manufacture output Y
(attracting 12 per cent GST).
Circular No 79/53/2018-GST available at <https://www.cbic.gov.in/resources//htdocs-cbec/gst/Circular-No-
79.pdf;jsessionid=CFAC18978FCA5664090473EACD101561> (accessed on 12 September 2021)
ii.     The refund of accumulated ITC in the situation at (i)
above, will be available under section 54(3) of the
CGST Act read with rule 89(5) of the CGST Rules,
which prescribes the formula for the maximum refund
amount permissible in such situations.
iii.    Further assume that the claimant supplies the output
Y having value of Rs. 3,000/- during the relevant
period for which the refund is being claimed.
Therefore, the turnover of inverted rated supply of
goods and services will be Rs. 3,000/-. Since the
claimant has no other outward supplies, his adjusted
total turnover will also be Rs. 3,000/-.
iv.     If we assume that Input A, having value of Rs. 500/-
and Input B, having value of Rs. 2,000/-, have been
purchased in the relevant period for the manufacture
of Y, then Net ITC shall be equal to Rs. 385/- (Rs.
respectively).
v.      Therefore, multiplying Net ITC by the ratio of turnover
of inverted rated supply of goods and services to the
adjusted total turnover will give the figure of Rs. 385/-.
vi.     From this, if we deduct the tax payable on such
inverted rated supply of goods or services, which is
Rs. 360/-, we get the maximum refund amount, as per
rule 89(5) of the CGST Rules which is Rs. 25/-.”
68     Para 4(b) of the Circular thereafter proceeds to give certain illustrations. The
above circular, it is urged, would demonstrate that the phrase “on account of” in the
proviso is interpreted by the State qua goods as a threshold condition. Hence even if
one input in the basket of inputs of a manufacturer results in an inverted duty
structure, the whole of the accumulated ITC can be availed of. On the other hand,
for services the same phrase is interpreted so as to mean ‘to the extent of’. The
expression “on account of” as understood for goods by the above circular must
apply for services as well, meaning thereby that it is a threshold condition alone.
69      The above submissions demonstrate the scholarship which has been brought
to bear upon the controversy by Counsel appearing on behalf of the assessees. The
above aspects of the statutory provision – Section 54(3) - must be juxtaposed
together with all the features of the statutory provision including Explanation- I which
have been adverted to earlier. The analysis earlier indicates why on a reading of the
provision as a whole, clauses (i) and (ii) of the first proviso are restrictions and not
mere conditions of eligibility. It is not possible for the Court to restrict the ambit of
clause (ii) of the proviso, based on a circular which has been issued by the Ministry
of Finance on 31 December 2018. In substance, the argument boils down to an
effort to lead this Court to hold that in spite of the language which has been used in
clause (ii) of the first proviso, (where the credit is accumulated on account of rate of
tax on inputs being higher than the rate of tax on output supplies), input services
must be read into the term “inputs”. The assessees argue that the Departmental
understanding, as reflected in the circular, should be the basis of interpreting a
statutory provision. Such an exercise would be impermissible, when its effect is to
expand the area of refund contemplated by the first proviso to cover input services in
addition to input goods despite statutory language to the contrary. Sub-Section (3) of
Section 54 begins, in its main part, with the stipulation that a registered person may
claim refund of any ‘unutilised ITC at the end of any tax period’. Whether we
construe the first proviso as an exception or in the nature of a fresh enactment, the
clear intent of Parliament was to confine the grant of refund to the two categories
spelt out in clauses (i) and (ii) of the first proviso. That clauses (i) and (ii) are the only
two situations in which a refund can be granted is evident from the opening words of
the first proviso which stipulates that “no refund of unutilised input tax credit
shall be allowed in cases other than”. What follows is clauses (i) and (ii). The
intent of Parliament is evident by the use of a double – negative format by employing
the expression “no refund” as well as the expression “in cases other than”. In other
words, a refund is contemplated in the situations provided in clauses (i) and (ii) and
no other. To put it differently, the first proviso can be recast, without altering its
meaning to read that a refund of unutilised ITC shall be allowed only in the cases
governed by clauses (i) and (ii). Clause (i) deals with zero rated supplies without
payment of tax. Explanation-1 to Section 54 clarifies that the expression ‘refund’
includes refund of tax paid on zero rated supplies on goods or services or both, or
on inputs or input services used in making such zero-rated supplies. On the other
hand, in the case of deemed exports, Explanation-1 refers to a refund of tax on the
supply of goods. Likewise in regard to domestic supplies, governed by clause (ii) of
the first proviso, the expression ‘refund’ means refund of unutilised ITC as provided
under sub-Section (3). With the clear language which has been adopted by
Parliament while enacting the provisions of Section 54(3), the acceptance of the
submission which has been urged on behalf of the assessee would involve a judicial
re-writing of the provision which is impermissible in law. Clause (ii) of the proviso,
when it refers to “on account of” clearly intends the meaning which can ordinarily be
said to imply ‘because of or due to’. When proviso (ii) refers to “rate of tax”, it
indicates a clear intent that a refund would be allowed where and only if the inverted
duty structure has arisen due to the rate of tax on input being higher than the rate of
tax on output supplies. Reading the expression ‘input’ to cover input goods and input
services would lead to recognising an entitlement to refund, beyond what was
contemplated by Parliament.
70     We must be cognizant of the fact that no constitutional right is being asserted
to claim a refund, as there cannot be. Refund is a matter of a statutory prescription.
Parliament was within its legislative authority in determining whether refunds should
be allowed of unutilised ITC tracing its origin both to input goods and input services
or, as it has legislated, input goods alone. By its clear stipulation that a refund would
be admissible only where the unutilised ITC has accumulated on account of the rate
of tax on inputs being higher than the rate of tax on output supplies, Parliament has
confined the refund in the manner which we have described above. While
recognising an entitlement to refund, it is open to the legislature to define the
circumstances in which a refund can be claimed. The proviso to Section 54(3) is not
a condition of eligibility (as the assessees’ Counsel submitted) but a restriction which
must govern the grant of refund under Section 54(3). We therefore, accept the
submission which has been urged by Mr N Venkataraman, learned ASG.
F.5    Constitutional validity: The ultra vires doctrine
71     The submission which has been urged on behalf of the assessees is that if
Section 54(3) is construed to confine a refund of unutilised ITC only to the extent
that the accumulation arises on account of the rate of tax on inputs (meaning input
goods) exceeding the rate of tax on outward supplies, the principles underlying
Article 14 of the Constitution would be attracted and the statutory provision would
suffer from the vice of arbitrariness. The submission is that this has become an
incident of a class legislation: the class consists of registered persons having
unutilised ITC. The class comprises of the following species (i) domestic suppliers;
and (ii) exporters. The sub-species are (i) input goods; and (ii) input services.
Opposing this submission, the learned ASG’s submission is that this is a valid
classification, denying one of the species namely input services the benefit of
72        The principle which Counsel for the assesses espouse is sought to be
buttressed by relying upon the decision in State of Jammu & Kashmir v. Triloki
Nath Khosa41 and in Re The Special Courts Bill, 197842. The principles which are
gleaned by Counsel from the above decisions, in their application to the present
(i)     Once the ITC comes within the fold of the electronic credit ledger and is
comprised into a homogenous credit, a ‘micro distinction’ cannot be
(ii)    A similarity of features between species comprised in the class is
sufficient: in the case of goods as well as services, the taxable event is the
value addition tax and the administrative machinery treats goods as well
as services similarly. The mere fact of goods being tangible is a matter of
no consequence.
73     Equality, it has been stressed in the above submission, cannot be cabined,
cribbed and confined. Differentiating between goods and services, it has been
urged, is not permissible and does not have a reasonable nexus to the object sought
to be achieved. There is an evident difference in the rates at which goods and
services are taxed but, according to the submission, this is not a provision for
revenue harvesting. Finally, on this limb of submission, it has been urged that the
wide latitude which is available with the legislature in the case of fiscal legislation is
only where a revenue harvesting measure is involved. The twin test of
reasonableness and the nexus with the object sought to be achieved must be
demonstrated. The nexus (a) must be based on the object of the legislation alone;
and (b) indicate a discernible principle which emanates from the classification. With
the clarification on inputs by the Ministry of Finance, it is urged that no discernible
principle emerges.
74     Counsel for the assesses also argued that before the High Courts of Gujarat
and Madras, the Union Government did not urge that outflow of finance was the
reason to exclude refunds on input services and it is not open to the Court to conjure
up a reason. In support of the above submissions on constitutional validity, which
have been urged by Mr Sujit Ghosh, learned Counsel, Mr Arvind Datar, learned
Senior Counsel has urged that it would be paradoxical to posit on the one hand that
goods and services are pari materia for the purpose of levy, collection and penalty
but, that a distinction will be made between them for the purpose of refund.
75      As a matter of first principle, it is not possible to accept the premise that the
guiding principles which impart a measure of flexibility to the legislature in designing
appropriate classifications for the purpose of a fiscal regime should be confined only
to the revenue harvesting measures of a statute. The precedents of this Court
provide abundant justification for the fundamental principle that a discriminatory
provision under tax legislation is not per se invalid. A cause of invalidity arises where
equals are treated as unequally and unequals are treated as equals. Both under the
Constitution and the CGST Act, goods and services and input goods and input
services are not treated as one and the same and they are distinct species.
76      Parliament engrafted a provision for refund Section 54(3). In enacting such a
provision, Parliament is entitled to make policy choices and adopt appropriate
classifications, given the latitude which our constitutional jurisprudence allows it in
matters involving tax legislation and to provide for exemptions, concessions and
benefits on terms, as it considers appropriate. The consistent line of precedent of
this Court emphasises certain basic precepts which govern both judicial review and
judicial interpretation of tax legislation. These precepts are:
(i)     Selecting the objects to be taxed, determining the quantum of tax,
legislating for the conditions for the levy and the socio-economic goals
which a tax must achieve are matters of legislative policy. Chief Justice M.
Hidayatullah,    speaking    for   the  Constitution  Bench    in   Assistant
Commissioner of Urban Land Tax v. Buckingham and Carnatic Co.
“10…The objects to be taxed, the quantum of tax to be levied,
the conditions subject to which it is levied and the social and
economic policies which a tax is designed to subserve are all
matters of political character and these matters have been
entrusted to the Legislature and not to the Courts. In applying
the test of reasonableness it is also essential to notice that
the power of taxation is generally regarded as an essential
attribute of sovereignty and constitutional provisions relating
to the power of taxation are regarded not as grant of power
but as limitation upon the power which would otherwise be
practically without limit.
(ii)    The same principle has been reiterated in Federation of Hotel &
Restaurant Association of India v. Union of India44, where Justice MN
Venkatachaliah (as the learned Chief Justice then was), speaking for the
“46. It is now well settled that though taxing laws are not
outside Article 14, however, having regard to the wide variety
of diverse economic criteria that go into the formulation of a
fiscal policy legislature enjoys a wide latitude in the matter of
selection of persons, subject-matter, events, etc., for taxation.
The tests of the vice of discrimination in a taxing law are,
accordingly, less rigorous. In examining the allegations of a
hostile, discriminatory treatment what is looked into is not its
phraseology, but the real effect of its provisions. A legislature
does not, as an old saying goes, have to tax everything in
order to be able to tax something. If there is equality and
uniformity within each group, the law would not be
discriminatory. Decisions of this Court on the matter have
permitted the legislatures to exercise an extremely wide
discretion in classifying items for tax purposes, so long as it
refrains from clear and hostile discrimination against
particular persons or classes.
47. But, with all this latitude certain irreducible desiderata of
equality shall govern classifications for differential treatment
in taxation laws as well. The classification must be rational
and based on some qualities and characteristics which are to
be found in all the persons grouped together and absent in
the others left out of the class. But this alone is not sufficient.
Differentia must have a rational nexus with the object sought
to be achieved by the law. The State, in the exercise of its
governmental power, has, of necessity, to make laws
operating differently in relation to different groups or classes
of persons to attain certain ends and must, therefore, possess
the power to distinguish and classify persons or things. It is
also recognised that no precise or set formulae or doctrinaire
tests or precise scientific principles of exclusion or inclusion
are to be applied. The test could only be one of palpable
arbitrariness applied in the context of the felt needs of the
times and societal exigencies informed by experience.”
(iii) In matters of classification, involving fiscal legislation, the legislature is
permitted a larger discretion so long as there is no transgression of the
fundamental principle underlying the doctrine of classification. In Hiralal
Rattanlal (supra), Justice KS Hegde, speaking for a four judge Bench
“20. It must be noticed that generally speaking the primary
purpose of the levy of all taxes is to raise funds for public
good. Which person should be taxed, what transaction should
be taxed or what goods should be taxed, depends upon
social, economic and administrative considerations. In a
democratic set up it is for the Legislature to decide what
economic or social policy it should pursue or what
administrative considerations it should bear in mind. The
classification between the processed or split pulses and
unprocessed or unsplit pulses is a reasonable classification. It
is based on the use to which those goods can be put. Hence,
in our opinion, the impugned classification is not violative of
(iv)    More recently in Union of India v. NITDIP Textile Processors Private
“67. It has been laid down in a large number of decisions of
this Court that a taxation statute, for the reasons of functional
expediency and even otherwise, can pick and choose to tax
some. A power to classify being extremely broad and based
on diverse considerations of executive pragmatism, the
judicature cannot rush in where even the legislature warily
treads. All these operational restraints on judicial power must
weigh more emphatically where the subject is taxation.
Discrimination resulting from fortuitous circumstances arising
out of particular situations, in which some of the tax-payers
find themselves, is not hit by Article 14 if the legislation, as
such, is of general application and does not single them out
for harsh treatment. Advantages or disadvantages to
individual assessees are accidental and inevitable and are
inherent in every taxing statute as it has to draw a line
somewhere and some cases necessarily fall on the other side
of the line.”
77        The principles governing a benefit, by way of a refund of tax paid, may well be
construed on an analogous frame with an exemption from the payment of tax or a
reduction in liability (Assistant Commissioner of Commercial Tax (Asst.) v.
78        In Elel Hotels and Investments Limited and Others v. Union of India47,
Justice MN Venkatachaliah (as the learned Chief Justice then was) held that:
“20…It is now well settled that a very wide latitude is available
to the legislature in the matter of classification of objects,
persons and things for purposes of taxation. It must need to
be so, having regard to the complexities involved in the
formulation of a taxation policy. Taxation is not now a mere
source of raising money to defray expenses of Government. It
is a recognised fiscal tool to achieve fiscal and social
objectives. The differentia of classification presupposes and
proceeds on the premise that it distinguishes and keeps apart
as a distinct class hotels with higher economic status
reflected in one of the indicia of such economic superiority.
The presumption of constitutionality has not been dislodged
by the petitioners by demonstrating how even hotels, not
brought into the class, have also equal or higher chargeable
receipts and how the assumption of economic superiority of
hotels to which the Act is applied is erroneous or irrelevant.”
79       In Spences Hotel Pvt Ltd. v. State of West Bengal48, a two judge Bench,
speaking through Justice KN Saikia, revisited the precedents of this Court governing
the principles of classification in tax legislation and held:
“24…The history of taxation is one of evolution as is the case
in all human affairs. Its progress is one of constant growth
and development in keeping with the advancing economic
and social conditions; and the fiscal intelligence of the State
has been advancing concomitantly, subjecting by new means
and methods hitherto untaxed property, income, service and
provisions to taxation. With the change of scientific,
commercial and economic conditions and ways of life new
species of property, both tangible and intangible gaining
enormous values have come into existence and new means
of reaching and subjecting the same to contribute towards
public finance are being developed, perfected and put into
practical operation by the legislatures and courts of this
country, of course within constitutional limitations.”
80      The Court held that the principle of equality does not preclude the
classification of property, trade, profession and events for taxation – subjecting one
kind to one rate of taxation and another to a different rate. The State may exempt
certain classes of property from any taxation at all and impose different specific
taxes upon different species which it seeks to regulate. The Court held:
“27. “Perfect equality in taxation has been said time and
again, to be impossible and unattainable. Approximation to it
is all that can be had. Under any system of taxation, however,
wisely and carefully framed, a disproportionate share of the
public burdens would be thrown on certain kinds of property,
because they are visible and tangible, while others are of a
nature to elude vigilance. It is only where statutes are passed
which impose taxes on false and unjust principle, or operate
to produce gross inequality, so that they cannot be deemed in
any just sense proportional in their effect on those who are to
bear the public charges that courts can interpose and arrest
the course of legislation by declaring such enactments void.”
“Perfectly equal taxation”, it has been said, “will remain an
unattainable good as long as laws and government and man
are imperfect.” ‘Perfect uniformity and perfect equality of
taxation’, in all the aspects in which the human mind can view
it, is a baseless dream.”
81      Parliament while enacting the provisions of Section 54(3), legislated within the
fold of the GST regime to prescribe a refund. While doing so, it has confined the
grant of refund in terms of the first proviso to Section 54(3) to the two categories
which are governed by clauses (i) and (ii). A claim to refund is governed by statute.
There is no constitutional entitlement to seek a refund. Parliament has in clause (i)
of the first proviso allowed a refund of the unutilized ITC in the case of zero-rated
supplies made without payment of tax. Under clause (ii) of the first proviso,
Parliament has envisaged a refund of unutilized ITC, where the credit has
accumulated on account of the rate of tax on inputs being higher than the rate of tax
on output supplies. When there is neither a constitutional guarantee nor a statutory
entitlement to refund, the submission that goods and services must necessarily be
treated at par on a matter of a refund of unutilized ITC cannot be accepted. Such an
interpretation, if carried to its logical conclusion would involve unforeseen
consequences, circumscribing the legislative discretion of Parliament to fashion the
rate of tax, concessions and exemptions. If the judiciary were to do so, it would run
the risk of encroaching upon legislative choices, and on policy decisions which are
the prerogative of the executive. Many of the considerations which underlie these
choices are based on complex balances drawn between political, economic and
social needs and aspirations and are a result of careful analysis of the data and
information regarding the levy of taxes and their collection. That is precisely the
reason why courts are averse to entering the area of policy matters on fiscal issues.
We are therefore unable to accept the challenge to the constitutional validity of
82     Rule 89(5) of the CGST Rules provides for the computation of the refund of
ITC on account of an inverted duty structure. The rule, as it was originally enacted,
provided for a refund of ITC paid both on input goods and input services. Rules
89(5) was amended on 18 April 2018 with prospective effect. On 13 June 2018, Rule
89(5) as amended was substituted with retrospective effect from 1 July 2017. The
effect of this amendment is that refund of unutilized ITC can only be availed on input
83     Section 164 of the CGST Act empowers the ‘government’ (the expression
‘government’ being defined in Section 2(53) to mean the Central Government) to
make rules for carrying out the provisions of the Act on the recommendations of the
GST Council. Sub-Section (3) of Section 164 stipulates that that power to make
rules shall include the power to make rules with retrospective effect not earlier than
the date on which the provisions of the Act came into force. As a result of the
amendment of Rule 89(5), the formula which has been specified for the refund of
“Maximum Refund Amount = {(Turnover of inverted rated
supply of goods and services) x Net ITC ÷ Adjusted Total
Turnover} – tax payable on such inverted rated supply of
goods and services.
Explanation- For the purposes of this sub-rule, the
(a) Net ITC shall mean input tax credit availed on inputs
during the relevant period other than the input tax credit
availed for which refund is claimed under sub-rules (4A)
(b) Adjusted Total turnover shall have the same meaning as
assigned to them in sub-rule (4).”
G.1    The validity of Rule 89(5) of CGST Rules in exercise of the rule-making
84     A preliminary submission which has been urged by Mr V Sridharan, learned
Senior Counsel is that the rule-making power under Section 164 of the CGST Act
can only be used if specific authority for making the rule is granted by the particular
section of the CGST Act. Elaborating on this submission, Mr V Sridharan has
submitted that under the CGST Act, various sections expressly employ the word
“prescribed” to indicate that rules may be formulated by way of delegated legislation
for that particular section. As an instance, Mr Sridharan points out that Section 9
provides that the manner in which tax is to be collected may be ‘prescribed’; Section
16(1) provides for conditions and restrictions for availing ITC which may be
‘prescribed’ and Section 31(2) provides that the time within which a person
supplying a taxable service must issue an invoice may be ‘prescribed’. These are
examples where the statute has expressly contemplated that rules would have to be
framed to give effect to a specific provision. It is the submission of Mr Sridharan that
in the absence of such words in the text of the legislation, the government cannot
exercise its authority under Section 164 of the CGST Act to frame rules for other
sections. Thus, since Section 54(3) does not provide any words which indicate that
specific authority has been granted for framing rules, Rule 89(5) is (according to the
submission) invalid.
85     We are unable to accept the above submission as it proceeds on a
misconception. Under Section 164(1), confers an express power on the Central
Government to make rules for carrying out the provisions of the CGST Act on the
recommendations of the GST Council. It may be true that in certain specific statutory
provisions, the Act recognizes, by using the expression ‘prescribes’, that rules may
be framed for that purpose. But the converse cannot be assumed inferentially, by
presuming that in other areas, recourse to the rule making power cannot be taken.
By its very nature, a statutory provision may not visualize every eventuality which
may arise in implementing the provisions of the Act. Hence it is open to the rule
making authority to frame rules, so long as they are consistent with the provisions of
the parent enactment. The rules may interstitially fill-up gaps which are unattended
in the main legislation or introduce provisions for implementing the legislation. So
long as the authority which frames the rules has not transgressed a provision of the
statute, it cannot be deprived of its authority to exercise the rule making power. The
wide powers given under Section 164 of the CGST Act are only limited by the
provisions of the Act itself, in furtherance of which a rule maybe framed. It is for this
reason that the powers under Section 164 are not restricted to only those sections
which grant specific authority to frame rules. If such a construction, as Mr Sridharan
has hypothesised, were to be acceptable, it would render the provisions of Section
164 otiose. Thus, we find that the absence of the words “as may be prescribed” in
Section 54(3) does not deprive the rule making authority to make rules for carrying
out the provisions of the Act.
G.2     The vires of Rule 89(5) vis-à-vis Section 54(3) of the CGST Act
86      The next submission which has been urged by Mr V Sridharan, learned
Senior Counsel is that Rule 89(5) is not in line with Section 54(3). The rule, as
retrospectively amended, is asserted to be ultra vires Section 54(3) in as much as it
restricts the computation of refund by taking into account only the credit availed on
input goods. Moreover, under Section 54(1), the CGST Rules can provide only the
form and manner in which an application for refund can be made and the
substantive provisions of the CGST Act cannot, it is urged, be curtailed by making a
contrary rule. The above submission which seeks to apply the doctrine of ultra vires
is based on the hypothesis that the rule is not in line with Section 54(3). The
submission, in other words, is based on the assumption that Section 54(3) allows for
a refund of unutilized ITC as a result of an inverted duty structure due to input goods
as well as input services.
87      The second limb of Mr Sridharan’s submission is that any rules framed under
Section 164 of the CGST Act must be for “carrying out the provisions of the Act”.
According to the submission, Section 54(3) provides for entitlement to refund of
unutilized ITC, its quantum and for cases in which refund is to be granted. This is a
complete code which does not require any rules for its operations and there is no
reference in Section 54(3) enabling the Government to frame rules in this regard.
Hence, the exercise of the rule making power is urged to be unnecessary and
88      The rule-making power under Section 164(1) of the CGST Act may be
exercised in numerous situations. As we have already noticed earlier in this
judgment accumulation of credit may occur due to a variety of reasons including the
absence of outwards supplies in a tax period, making supplies at a loss including by
discount or predatory pricing, bulk purchase of inputs, large opening balance of
credit or change in the rate of tax during the tax period. A rule providing for
identifying unutilized ITC which is attributable to supplies having an inverted duty
structure and bifurcating it from credit which has accumulated due to other causes
would be a rule required for carrying out the provisions of the Act. A second instance
to illustrate the same point is that a rule may provide a proportionate formula for
determining the pro rata amount of ITC relatable to the inverted duty structure vis-à-
vis the total turnover. Such a formula is necessary where the assessee is engaged
in outward supplies involving an inverted duty structure as well as those not
involving an inverted duty structure. In fact, Mr Sridharan in his submissions also
accepts that such a formula would be a rule made for carrying out provisions of the
Act. The third illustration in the link is with reference to exports. Under the CGST
Act, ITC relatable to exports (which are zero-rated supplies) has to be refunded. The
assessee may have both domestic sales as well as exports in which event there is a
need for a proportionate formula. Rule 89(4) provides a formula for refund of ITC to
cover a situation in which zero-rated supplies of goods or services or both has been
done without payment of tax under bond or letter of undertaking in accordance with
Section 16(3) of the IGST Act.
89     Mr Sridharan, while arguing that Section 54(3) is a complete code in itself and
does not warrant a rule to further the provisions of the Act, fairly concedes in his
written note that a formula maybe required for bifurcating the accumulated ITC for
the purpose of refund. According to the illustration which has been furnished by Mr
Sridharan in his written note, where an assessee has supplies which fall under an
inverted duty structure and supplies which do not, a refund of unutilized ITC can be
availed of only related to the former but not the latter. A formula would be required to
compute the ITC attributable to the two categories so that a refund is granted to the
former and not the latter. Rule 89(5) estimates the refund attributable to the inverted
duty structure by adopting a proportionate turnover basis, that is by dividing the
turnover of inverted duty structure supplies by the adjusted total turnover and
multiplying it with the ‘Net ITC’. The submission proceeds to concede that the need
and rationale for the formula contained in Rule 89(5) in considering the turnover of
supplies   relating   to  inverted   duty   structure    vis-à-vis overall  turnover   is
“understandable and reasonable”.
90     The grievance however is that Rule 89(5) goes beyond the “provisions of the
Act” when in the garb of fixing a formula, it restricts the refund of ITC to input goods
by denying ITC of input services. This is done by defining ‘Net ITC’ to mean ITC
availed of inputs. The gravamen of the challenge is that this consequently ignores
ITC relatable to input services. In other words, the submission is that Rule 89(5)
cannot be construed to be a rule for carrying out the “provisions of the Act”.
91       Mr V Sridharan has also submitted that in case a rule restricts the purpose of
the legislation, it can be struck down if it is ultra vires the principal statute. This is
because despite a provision for laying rules before a House of Parliament,
subjecting them to the procedure for modification and annulment, a rule can never
be equated with the process of legislation since in particular the rule lacks the
assent of the President or the Governor as the case may be. In support of his
submission, he has relied on the decision of a Constitution Bench in Kerala State
Electricity Board v. Indian Alluvium Co. Ltd.49 and the decision in Bharat Hari
Singhania v. Commissioner of Wealth Tax (Central)50 rendered by a three judge
92       The second limb of the line of challenge is that even though the rules are
required to be recommended by the GST Council this will not elevate them to the
status of a law enacted by the legislature. The submission which has been urged by
Mr V Sridharan proceeds on an underlying assumption which is that Rule 89(5) by
restricting the definition of Net ITC to mean ITC availed on input goods is an affront
to Section 54(3). It is on this foundation, that it has been urged that a rule which is
contrary to the statute cannot be saved merely on the ground that either (i) the rule
has been laid before Parliament and is subject to its power of modification
annulment or amendment; or (ii) the rule was made on the recommendations of the
GST Council. The application of the second layer of the argument does not arise in
the present case for the simple reason that Rule 89(5) in defining Net ITC to mean
“input tax credit availed on inputs” does not transgress the statutory restriction which
is contained in proviso (ii) of Section 54(3). The challenge to Rule 89(5) as a piece
of delegated legislation on the ground that it is ultra vires Clause (ii) of the first
proviso to Section 54(3) is therefore lacking in substance. As reasoned in the earlier
part of this judgment, Clause (ii) of the first proviso is not merely a condition of
eligibility for availing of a refund but a substantive restriction under which a refund of
unutilized ITC can be availed of only when the accumulation is relatable to an
inverted duty structure, namely the tax on input goods being higher than the rate of
tax on output supplies. There is therefore no disharmony between Rule 89(5) on the
one hand and Section 54(3) particularly Clause (ii) of its first proviso on the other
93      For the sake of clarity, it is necessary to reproduce para 24.6 and para 24.7 of
“24.5 Similarly, this… court has in several cases extended the
benefit of exemption/ lower rate in case where such denial to
a particular case was ultra vires or unconstitutional, thereby
enlarging the scope of beneficial provision.
24.6 In the present case, challenge to the vires of Rule 89(5)
is only because of definition of Net ITC in Explanation to the
“Net ITC” shall mean input tax credit availed on inputs during
the relevant period other than the input tax credit availed for
which refund is claimed under sub-rules (4A) or (4B) or both”
94     Mr Sridharan urges that the words ‘inputs’ in Explanation (a) to Rule 89(5) be
struck down as being severable to bring it “entirely in line with the main provision”.
We are unable to accept this submission. Explanation (a) to Rule 89(5) in defining
‘Net ITC’ to mean ITC availed on inputs (goods) is, as a matter of fact, entirely in line
with the main provision, Section 54(3). On the contrary, to accept the submission of
Mr Sridharan, would expand the ambit of Rule 89(5) beyond the terms governing the
admissibility of a refund under Section 54(3) and would be hence impermissible.
G.3    The validity of the formula prescribed in Rule 89(5)
95     Mr G Natarajan, Mr Sujit Ghosh, learned Counsel, and Mr V Sridharan,
learned Senior Counsel, have also urged an alternative submission for the challenge
to Rule 89(5). It has been submitted that the formula prescribed in Rule 89(5) which
seeks to grant refund of the ITC accumulated on account of input goods, is
inherently flawed and will lead to anomalous results. The alternative submission is
made on the assumption that Section 54(3)(ii) read with Rule 89(5) is restricted to
refund of ITC accumulated on account of input goods only, and not input services.
96     Mr G Natarajan, learned Counsel appearing on behalf of the intervenor, has
submitted that as it was originally framed, ‘Net ITC’ in Rule 89(5) allowed for a
refund on account of an inverted duty structure both for input goods and input
services. The position was amended initially on 18 April 2018 with prospective effect
and thereafter on 13 June 2018 with retrospective effect on 1 July 2017. The formula
prescribed in Rule 89(5) seeks to identify the quantum of ITC availed on input goods
attributable to the outward supplies having an inverted rate structure. From such
quantum of ITC on input goods, the tax payable by the supplier on such inverted
rated supplies of goods and services is reduced to arrive at the quantum of credit
accumulating on account of inverted rate structure, which is eligible for refund. The
submission of Mr Natarajan is that in the formula prescribed under Rule 89(5), while
reducing “tax payable on such inverted rated supplies of goods or services”, the tax-
payer should first be allowed to utilize the ITC availed on input services which is
otherwise not eligible for refund. If the formula prescribed under Rule 89(5) is not
construed in the above manner, it is alleged that it will lead to inequality between
taxpayers dealing with outward supplies involving only an inverted rate structure
(single line of goods) and taxpayers dealing with outward supplies having both an
inverted rate structure and those not having inverted rate structure. Thus, it has
been submitted that the Court should read down the formula prescribed in Rule
89(5) to the effect that while calculating the refund entitlement as the difference
between Net ITC and tax payable on such supplies having inverted rate structure, it
is presumed that the ITC accumulated on account of input services be allowed to be
used for payment of tax payable on inverted goods and services, and the remaining
balance of tax, which is paid out of accumulated ITC on account of input goods, is
deducted from Net ITC in the formula.
97      Mr G Natarajan’s submission indicates an aberration where a registered
person with a single product with an inverted duty structure is neither able to use the
unutilized ITC for the payment of tax on output supply nor is allowed a refund. On
the other hand, a registered person with products involving an inverted duty
structure and otherwise, is in a position to utilise the ITC availed on input services
for payment of tax on turnover not having an inverted rate structure. Mr G Natarajan

98     The submission of Mr Natarajan has also been supported by Mr V Sridharan
in rebuttal. The formula in Rule 89(5) is reproduced below:
{(Turnover of inverted rated supply of goods and services) x
Net ITC ÷ Adjusted Total Turnover} − tax payable on such
inverted rated supply of goods and services”
99      Mr V Sridharan has urged that the second leg of the formula, that is, “tax
payable on such inverted rated supply of goods and services” takes into account the
entire tax payable on output supplies. In reality, the tax payable on output supplies
would have been discharged by utilising the ITC on input goods and input services.
However, the formula under Rule 89(5) presumes that nothing has been utilised
from the ITC on input services and the entire tax on output supplies is discharged by
utilising ITC on input goods. It was urged that although the stated objective of the
formula is to grant refund of unutilised ITC accumulated on account of input goods,
by deducting the entire sum of tax payable on output supplies, the quantum of such
refund is reduced and the cascading effect of taxes is maximised. As a solution to
the said anomaly, Mr Sridharan has proposed that for the purposes of Rule 89(5), an
assumption must be made that ITC accumulated on account of input services, which
is not refundable under Section 54(3), is used for discharging the output tax payable
on inverted rate supply of goods and services. The remaining balance of output tax,
must be then presumed to have been discharged from the ITC accumulated on
account of input goods and it is only this remaining balance that should be deducted
from the formula to calculate the refund. In other words, Mr Natarajan and Mr
Sridharan propose an order of utilisation in the formula by which the ITC
accumulated on account of input services is used first for discharging the tax liability
and only then is the ITC accumulated on account of input goods used. During the
course of his submissions, Mr Sridharan has relied on the decision of this Court in
Commissioner of Income Tax, Coimbatore v. Lakshmi Machine Works 51 and
has urged before us to adopt a purposeful and schematic interpretation to the
formula which will make it comparable and workable.
100      Mr Sujit Ghosh has urged before us that the formula in Rule 89(5) creates a
distinction between suppliers of services having a higher component of input goods
than input services as against suppliers of services having a higher component of
input services than input goods. In his submissions, Rule 89(5) would favour the
former as they would be entitled to a larger quantum of refund on account of more
use of input goods.
101      In response to these submissions, Mr N Venkataraman, learned ASG, has
conceded that certain inadequacies might exist in the formula. However, he has
sought to justify the need for a formula in Rule 89(5). The ASG has submitted that
under the scheme of the CGST Act, the accumulated ITC arising out of input goods
and input services is booked into the electronic credit ledger and is to be utilised
thereafter for payment of tax on outward supplies on goods and services in
accordance with Section 49 of the CGST Act. Once payments are made from the
electronic ledger, the remaining quantum of unutilised ITC becomes one
homogenous nucleus and it is impossible to attribute the unutilised ITC to its source,
that is, it cannot be identified whether the balance unutilised ITC is arising from input
goods or input services. In order to bifurcate the unutilised ITC into input goods and
input services for the purpose of granting refund in accordance with Section 54(3)(ii)
on ITC on inputs, Rule 89(5)3 has resorted to prescribing a formula to legally dissect
the unutilised ITC. The learned ASG has urged that the prescription of formulae to
artificially determine refund or utilisation is a common practice in the field of taxation
and was used prior to the enactment of the CGST Act in MODVAT/CENVAT Rules
for determining quantum of eligibility of credit. Another instance is Rule 42 and 43 of
the CGST Rules 2017 which provide specific formulae in restricting the ITC when a
registered supplier uses input goods, input services and capital goods for purpose of
business and other than business purposes.
102      The ASG, having justified the need for a formula, has then argued that a
formula prescribed by delegated legislation may not be perfect and may have certain
aberrations. However, a wide discretion is given to the policy makers in this regard
and only if the formula is arbitrary and violative of Article 14 of the Constitution, can
it be struck down. For this, the ASG has relied on the decision of a Constitution
Bench of this Court in RK Garg v. Union of India52, where it was observed that
economic legislation ought not to be measured by abstract symmetry, since it is
essentially empirical in nature and is based on experimentation. We note however,
that the ASG has not refuted the anomalies point out by the Counsel for the
103    In our view, the justification of the formula under Rule 89(5) given by the ASG
to create a legal bifurcation is valid. In this context, it would be material to advert to
the provisions of Rule 42. Rule 42(1) provides that the ITC in respect of input goods
or input services which attract the provisions of sub-Section (1) or sub-Section (2) of
Section 17 being partly used for the purpose of business and partly for other
purposes or partly used for affecting taxable supplies including zero rated supplies
and partly for effecting exempts supplies shall be attributed for the purposes of
business or for effecting taxable supplies in the manner which is indicated in the
Rule. Sub-Section (1) of Section 17 provides that where the goods and services or
both are used by a registered person partly for the purposes of any business and
partly for any other purpose, the amount of credit shall be restricted to so much of
the input tax as is attributable to the purpose of its business. Sub-Section (2) of
Section 17 provides that where the goods or services or both are used by a
registered person partly for effecting taxable supplies including zero rated supplies
under the CGST Act or under the IGST Act and partly for effecting exempt supplies
the amount of credit shall be restricted to so much of the input tax as is attributable
to the taxable supplies including zero rated supplies. Rule 42, in other words,
provides for the manner in which the attributions of ITC in respect of the input or
input services under sub-Sections (1) or (2) of Section 17 shall be carried out. Rule
43 similarly provides the manner in which ITC in respect of capital goods attracting
the provisions of sub-Section (1) of Section 17, used partly for business and partly
for other purposes or partly for effecting taxable supplies including zero rated
supplies and partly for effecting exempt supplies would be attracted to the purpose
of business or for effecting taxable supplies. Both Rules 42 and 43 provide for a
formula for attribution. Rule 86 provides for the maintenance of an electronic credit
ledger. Rule 89(5) provides for a refund. In both sets of rule clusters, Rules 42 and
43 on the one hand and Rule 89(5) on the other hand, a formula is used for the
purpose of attribution in a post assimilated scenario. The use of such formulae is a
familiar terrain in fiscal legislation including delegated legislation under parent norms
and is neither untoward nor ultra vires.
104     We now turn to the submissions of the counsel for the assessees regarding
the anomalies in the formula. In our view, the submission of Mr Sujit Ghosh, that the
formula creates a distinction between suppliers having a higher component of input
goods than those having a higher component of input services, and must be read
down accordingly, must be rejected. The purpose of the formula in Rule 89(5) is to
give effect to Section 54(3)(ii) which makes a distinction between input goods and
input services for grant of refund. Once the principle behind Section 54(3)(ii) of the
CGST Act is upheld, the formula cannot be struck down merely for giving effect to
the same.
105     The aberrations which have been pointed out by the Mr Sridharan and Mr G
Natarajan certainly indicate that the formula is not perfect. The formula makes a
presumption that the output tax payable on supplies has been entirely discharged
from the ITC accumulated on account of input goods and there has been no
utilisation of the ITC on input services. While a similar formula is provided in Rule
89(4) with regard to zero rated supplies, in that case, the ‘Net ITC’ includes input
goods and input services and thus, there is no imbalance between the different
components of the formula. The formula prescribed in Rule 89(5) however, seeks to
deduct the total output tax from only one component of the ITC, namely ITC on input
goods. This in our view is at odds with reality, where the ITC on both input goods
and input services is accumulated in the electronic ledger and is then utilised for the
payment of output tax. In making such an assumption, the formula tilts the balance
in favour of the Revenue by reducing the refund granted. We are equally cognizant
of the fact that the proposed solution, that is prescribing an order of utilisation of the
ITC accumulated on input services and input goods, may tilt the balance entirely in
favour of the assessee as that would make a contrary assumption that the output tax
is discharged by the ITC accumulated on account of input services entirely. Another
possible solution could be that the Rule itself provides for a statutory assumption or
a deeming fiction of utilisation of a certain percentage of ITC on input services
towards the payment of output tax for the purpose of calculation of refund.
106    While we are alive to the anomalies of the formula, an anomaly per se cannot
result in the invalidation of a fiscal rule which has been framed in exercise of the
power of delegated legislation. In RK Garg (supra), Justice P N Bhagwati (as the
learned Chief Justice then was) speaking for the Constitution Bench underscored
the importance of the rationale for viewing laws relating to economic activities with
greater latitude than laws touching civil rights. The Court held:
“8. Another rule of equal importance is that laws relating to
economic activities should be viewed with greater latitude
than laws touching civil rights such as freedom of speech,
religion etc. It has been said by no less a person than
Holmes, J., that the legislature should be allowed some play
in the joints, because it has to deal with complex problems
which do not admit of solution through any doctrinaire or
strait-jacket formula and this is particularly true in case of
legislation dealing with economic matters, where, having
regard to the nature of the problems required to be dealt with,
greater play in the joints has to be allowed to the legislature.
The court should feel more inclined to give judicial deference
to legislative judgment in the field of economic regulation than
in other areas where fundamental human rights are involved.
Nowhere has this admonition been more felicitously
expressed than in Morey v. Doud [351 US 457 : 1 L Ed 2d
1485 (1957)] where Frankfurter, J., said in his inimitable style:
“In the utilities, tax and economic regulation
self-restraint if not judicial deference to
legislative judgment. The legislature after all
has the affirmative responsibility. The courts
bewildering conflict of the experts, and the
overruled by events — self-limitation can be
institutional prestige and stability.”
The Court must always remember that “legislation is directed
to practical problems, that the economic mechanism is highly
sensitive and complex, that many problems are singular and
contingent, that laws are not abstract propositions and do not
relate to abstract units and are not to be measured by
abstract symmetry”; “that exact wisdom and nice adaption of
remedy are not always possible” and that “judgment is largely
a prophecy based on meagre and uninterpreted experience”.
Every legislation particularly in economic matters is
essentially empiric and it is based on experimentation or
what one may call trial and error method and therefore it
cannot provide for all possible situations or anticipate all
possible abuses. There may be crudities and inequities in
complicated experimental economic legislation but on
that account alone it cannot be struck down as invalid.
The courts cannot, as pointed out by the United States
Supreme Court in Secretary of Agriculture v. Central Roig
Refining Company [94 L Ed 381 : 338 US 604 (1950)] be
converted into tribunals for relief from such crudities and
inequities. There may even be possibilities of abuse, but
that too cannot of itself be a ground for invalidating the
legislation, because it is not possible for any legislature
to anticipate as if by some divine prescience, distortions
and abuses of its legislation which may be made by
those subject to its provisions and to provide against
such distortions and abuses. Indeed, howsoever great
may be the care bestowed on its framing, it is difficult to
conceive of a legislation which is not capable of being
abused by perverted human ingenuity. The Court must
therefore adjudge the constitutionality of such legislation by
the generality of its provisions and not by its crudities or
inequities or by the possibilities of abuse of any of its
provisions. If any crudities, inequities or possibilities of abuse
come to light, the legislature can always step in and enact
suitable amendatory legislation. That is the essence of
pragmatic approach which must guide and inspire the
legislature in dealing with complex economic issues.”
107    The dictum in RK Garg (supra) squarely applies to the present case in which
the Government has exercised its powers of delegated legislation to frame a
formula, which has certain inequities. However, these inequities are to be ironed out
by the Government in the course of the application of the formula. We are
affirmatively of the view that this Court should not in the exercise of the power of
judicial review allow itself to become a one-time arbiter of any and every anomaly of
a fiscal regime despite its meeting the jurisdictional framework for the validity of the
legislation, including delegated legislation.
108    Mr Sridharan had also urged that the formula may be read down as was done
by this Court in Lakshmi Machine Works (supra). In this case, the Court was faced
with a question of whether excise duty and sales tax were to be included in the ‘total
turnover’, which was a denominator in the formula prescribed under Section 80-
HHC(3) of the Income Tax Act 1961 for the purpose of arriving at the deduction from
profits retained for export business. In order to arrive at the deduction, the formula
apportioned business profits by the ratio of export turnover to total turnover. Various
amendments had been made by the legislature to the formula in Section 80-HHC(3)
to make the formula workable. The Court, speaking through Justice SH Kapadia (as
the learned Chief Justice then was), observed that
“21. According to The Law and Practice of Income Tax by
Kanga and Palkhivala, the word “profits” in Section 28 should
be understood in normal and proper sense. However, subject
to special requirements of the income tax, profits have got to
be assessed provided they are real profits. Such profits have
got to be ascertained on ordinary principles of commercial
trading and accounting. However, the Income Tax Act has
laid down certain rules to be applied in deciding how the tax
should be assessed and even if the result is to tax as profits
what cannot be construed as profits, still the requirements of
the Income Tax Act must be complied with. Where a
deduction is necessary in order to ascertain the profits and
gains, such deductions should be allowed. Profits should be
computed after deducting the expenses incurred for business
though such expenses may not be admissible expressly
under the Act, unless such expenses are expressly
disallowed by the Act (see p. 455 of The Law and Practice of
Income Tax by Kanga and Palkhivala). Therefore, schematic
interpretation for making the formula in Section 80-HHC
workable cannot be ruled out. Similarly, purposeful
interpretation of Section 80-HHC which has undergone so
many changes cannot be ruled out, particularly, when those
legislative changes indicate that the legislature intended to
exclude items like commission and interest from deduction on
the ground that they did not possess any element of
“turnover” even though commission and interest emanated
from exports. We have to read the words “total turnover” in
Section 80-HHC as part of the formula which sought to
segregate the “export profits” from the “business profits”.
Therefore, we have to read the formula in entirety. In that
formula the entire business profit is not given deduction. It is
the business profit which is proportionately reduced by the
above fraction/ratio of export turnover ÷ total turnover which
constitutes Section 80-HHC concession (deduction). Income
in the nature of “business profits” was, therefore, apportioned.
The above formula fixed a ratio in which “business profits”
under Section 28 of the Act had to be apportioned. Therefore,
one has to give weightage not only to the words “total
turnover” but also to the words “export turnover”, “total export
turnover” and “business profits”. That is the reason why we
have quoted hereinabove extensively the illustration from
the Direct Taxes (Income Tax) Ready Reckoner of the
relevant word.”
109      The Court in Lakshmi Machine Works (supra) was dealing with a question of
interpretation, where the formula was silent on inclusion of sales tax or excise duty,
in the definition of total turnover. Thus, a schematic interpretation was adopted to
give effect to the intent of the legislature.
110      In Commissioner of Income Tax v. HCL Technologies Limited53, a two
judge Bench of this Court considered whether, while calculating ‘export profit’ for the
deduction under Section 10-A of the Income Tax Act 1961, software development
charges are to be excluded from the definition of ‘total turnover’. For calculating the
export profit, the total profits of the business were apportioned by the ratio of export
turnover to total turnover. The issue was complicated as these charges were
allowed to be deducted from export turnover, which was a component of the total
turnover and the numerator in the formula. However, the Revenue had denied the
deduction from the total turnover, the denominator. The Court interpreted and
revised the formula as otherwise it would lead to undesirable results. In doing so,
“16. The respondent Company has claimed deduction under
Section 10-A as per certificates filed on Form 56-F. The
respondent, while computing the deduction, has taken the
same figure of export turnover as of total turnover. […]
17. In the above backdrop, we are of the opinion that the
definition of total turnover given under Sections 80-HHC and
80-HHE cannot be adopted for the purpose of Section 10-A
as the technical meaning of total turnover, which does not
envisage the reduction of any expenses from the total
amount, is to be taken into consideration for computing the
deduction under Section 10-A. When the meaning is clear,
there is no necessity of importing the meaning of total
turnover from the other provisions. If a term is defined under
Section 2 of the IT Act, then the definition would be applicable
to all the provisions wherein the same term appears. As the
term “total turnover” has been defined in the Explanation to
Sections 80-HHC and 80-HHE, wherein it has been clearly
stated that “for the purposes of this section only”, it would be
applicable only for the purposes of those sections and not for
the purpose of Section 10-A. If denominator includes
certain amount of certain type which numerator does not
include, the formula would render undesirable results.
22. In the instant case, if the deductions on freight,
telecommunication and insurance attributable to the
delivery of computer software under Section 10-A of the
IT Act are allowed only in export turnover but not from
the total turnover then, it would give rise to inadvertent,
unlawful, meaningless and illogical result which would
cause grave injustice to the respondent which could
have never been the intention of the legislature.
23. Even in common parlance, when the object of the formula
is to arrive at the profit from export business, expenses
excluded from export turnover have to be excluded from total
turnover also. Otherwise, any other interpretation makes the
formula unworkable and absurd. Hence, we are satisfied that
such deduction shall be allowed from the total turnover in
In Arun Kumar and Others v. Union of India54, a challenge was raised to the
validity of the Rule 3 of the Income Tax Rules 1962 which amended the method of
computing valuation of a ‘perquisite’ (which includes rent free accommodation
provided to an assessee by their employer) under Section 17(2) of the Income Tax
Act 1961. The appellants argued that the amended Rule did not provide the
assessee with the right to claim before the assessing officer that there was no
“concession” in the matter of rent with respect to the accommodation provided and
thus, Section 17(2) and Rule 3 were not applicable. An argument was raised to
“read down” the Rule by introducing the principle of audi alteram partem. Rejecting
this argument, the Court, speaking through Justice CK Thakker, noted that
“55. The doctrine of “reading down” is well known in the field
of constitutional law. Colin Howard in his well-known
work Australian Federal Constitutional Law states:
Reading down puts into operation the principle that so far as it
is reasonably possible to do so, legislation should be
construed as being within power. It has the practical effect
that where an Act is expressed in language of a generality
which makes it capable, if read literally, of applying to matters
beyond the relevant legislative power, the Court will construe
it in a more limited sense so as to keep it within power.”
The Court after reviewing the judicial precedents on this point observed:
“61. But it is equally well settled that if the provision of
law is explicitly clear, language unambiguous and
interpretation leaves no room for more than one
construction, it has to be read as it is. In that case, the
provision of law has to be tested on the touchstone of
the relevant provisions of law or of the Constitution and
it is not open to a court to invoke the doctrine of “reading
down” with a view to save the statute from declaring
it ultra vires by carrying it to the point of “perverting the
purposes of the statute.
65. As we have already indicated earlier, Rule 3 prior to its
amendment in 2001 was totally different. It dealt with the
method of calculation of concession keeping in view the
concept of “fair rental value”. In the light of the principle and
phraseology in Rule 3, the rule-making authority provided an
opportunity to the assessee to satisfy the assessing officer
that the rent sought to be recovered from the employee could
not be said to be “concession” as it was “fair rent”,
“reasonable rent”, “market rent” or “standard rent'. When the
rule is amended and the concept of “fair rental value” has
been done away with and the only method which has been
adopted is to calculate the rent on the basis of population of
the city in question, it cannot be successfully contended that
the intention of the rule-making authority was to afford an
opportunity to the assessee to convince the assessing officer
that the rent recovered by the employer from his employee
was not in the nature of concession. Nor a court of law would,
by interpretative process, grant such opportunity to the
assessee so as to enable him to convince the assessing
officer that the rent fixed was not covered by Section 17(2)(ii)
of the Act and therefore was not a “perquisite”. We are,
therefore, unable to accept the argument of Mr Salve and
allow import of the principles of natural justice in Rule 3.”
111     The above judicial precedents indicate that in the field of taxation, this Court
has only intervened to read down or interpret a formula if the formula leads to
absurd results or is unworkable. In the present case however, the formula is not
ambiguous in nature or unworkable, nor is it opposed to the intent of the legislature
in granting limited refund on accumulation of unutilised ITC. It is merely the case that
the practical effect of the formula might result in certain inequities. The reading down
of the formula as proposed by Mr Natarjan and Mr Sridharan by prescribing an order
of utilisation would take this Court down the path of recrafting the formula and walk
into the shoes of the executive or the legislature, which is impermissible.
Accordingly, we shall refrain from replacing the wisdom of the legislature or its
delegate with our own in such a case. However, given the anomalies pointed out by
the assessees, we strongly urge the GST Council to reconsider the formula and take
a policy decision regarding the same.
112     Having devoted our attention to the submissions at the Bar, we have come to
the conclusion that the judgment of the Madras High Court needs to be affirmed by
dismissing the appeals challenging that verdict while the appeals against the
judgment of the Gujarat High Court by the Union of India should be allowed.
113     The Division Bench of the Gujarat High Court having examined the provisions
of Section 54(3) and Rule 89(5) held that the latter was ultra vires. In its decision in
VKC Footsteps India Pvt. Ltd. (supra), the Gujarat High Court held that by
prescribing a formula in sub-Rule (5) of Rule 89 of the CGST Rules to execute
refund of unutilized ITC accumulated on account of input services, the delegate of
the legislature had acted contrary to the provisions of sub-Section (3) of Section 54
of the CGST Act which provides for a claim of refund of any unutilized ITC. The
Gujarat High Court noted the definition of ITC in Section 2(62) and held that Rule
89(5) by restricting the refund only to input goods had acted ultra vires Section
54(3). The Division Bench of the Madras High Court on the other hand while
delivering its judgment in Tvl. Transtonnelstory Afcons Joint Venture (supra)
declined to follow the view of the Gujarat High Court noting that the proviso to
Section 54(3) and, more significantly, its implications do not appear to have been
taken into consideration in VKC Footsteps India Pvt. Ltd. (supra) except for a brief
reference. Having considered this batch of appeals, and for the reasons which have
been adduced in this judgment, we affirm the view of the Madras High Court and
disapprove of the view of the Gujarat High Court. We accordingly order and direct
