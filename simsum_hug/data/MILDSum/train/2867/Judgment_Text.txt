2. The case of prosecution as emerging from the record and proceedings of
the Trial Court is that an information was received in the Police Station
Chhawla on 09.02.2012 at 09:18 PM from the police control room that a
girl was kidnapped in the red-coloured Tata Indica Car near Hanuman
Chowk, Qutub Vihar, Chhawla and the car had proceeded towards Shyam
Vihar. The information was recorded as DD No. 27 A, and the investigation
was entrusted to SI Prakash Chand. Accordingly, SI Prakash Chand along
with the constable Rakesh reached at the spot near Hanuman Chowk,
Qutub Vihar, where they met a girl named Saraswati. On her statement
being recorded to the effect that on 09.02.2012 at about 08:45 PM, when
she was returning from her job at DLF Gurgaon along with her friends
Pooja, Sangeeta and the victim Anamika (name is changed), and when they
were walking near the Hanuman Chowk, a red coloured Indica Car came
from behind; the driver suddenly applied breaks on reaching near to them;
that a boy opened the door of the car and pulled Anamika forcibly inside
the car; that there were other three or four boys sitting in the Indica Car.
On the basis of the said statement of the complainant Saraswati, an FIR
was registered under Section 363 of IPC. The investigation was
commenced by the SI Prakash Chand.
3. On 12.02.2012, the investigation of the case was transferred to the special
staff south-west New Delhi and was entrusted to SI Ashok Kumar. On
13.02.2012, further investigation of the case was entrusted to Inspector
Sandeep Gupta. On the same day ASI Rajender Singh produced the
accused Rahul and a red coloured Indica Car bearing registration no. DL-
3 CAF-4348 before the Inspector Sandeep Gupta, stating that accused
Rahul who was found perplexed and roaming in the said car near Metro
station, sector-9 Dwarka, New Delhi.
4. During the course of interrogation of the accused Rahul by the Inspector
Sandeep Gupta, Rahul confessed that he along with his brother Ravi and
one Vinod @ Chhotu had kidnapped a girl from Qutub Vihar; had
committed rape on her, had killed her and had thrown her dead body in the
fields ahead of Jhajjar. The said accused Rahul therefore was arrested, and
subsequently the accused Ravi and accused Vinod were also arrested. The
disclosure statements of the other two accused were also recorded wherein
they had admitted to have kidnapped, gang raped and killed the victim.
5. As per the further case of the prosecution, when the aforesaid Tata Indica
car was seized, mobile phones were recovered from the personal search of
the accused Rahul and the accused Ravi, and they were also seized.
Thereafter, inspector Sandeep Gupta alongwith his staff and the two
accused Ravi and Vinod left for the search of the dead body of the victim,
and found the same lying in the mustard fields, near Karawara Morel,
village Rodai, at the instance of the two accused. Information about the
same was conveyed to P.S. Rodai. Thereafter ASI Balwan alongwith his
Crime Team from P.S. Rodai also reached at the spot. The Crime Team
lifted some hair strands from the body of the deceased as well as two plastic
glasses, one empty pouch of snacks, piece of earthenware pot, a broken
piece of a red-coloured plastic bumper and one wallet near the dead body.
Thereafter ASI Balwan Singh sent the dead body to Civil Hospital, Rewari
for postmortem examination. The two accused were brought to Delhi and
were got medically examined. During the course of further interrogation,
the accused Rahul got recovered the mobile phone of the deceased. The
accused also got recovered the panty of the deceased which she was
wearing at the time of incident and the steel Parat, in which they had burnt
the articles belonging to the deceased.
6. On 15.02.2012 further investigation of the case was entrusted to Inspector
Ranjeet Singh. He got the aforesaid Tata Indica Car inspected by CFSL
team. Hair strands found inside the car as well as in its seat covers were
seized. He obtained the opinion from the autopsy doctor regarding the Jack
and Pana, which were found in the Tata Indica Car and it was opined by
the doctor that the external injuries found on the body of the deceased were
possible by the said Jack and Pana. The hair strands of the deceased which
had been preserved by the autopsy doctor were sent to Safdarjung Hospital
for examination. All the articles lifted from and near the dead body were
sent to CFSL for examination. The Tata Indica Car was also sent to CFSL
for examination. The IO also obtained the call details record of mobile no.
9540594640 of the deceased, mobile no. 9968988533 of the accused Rahul
and mobile no. 8802090923 of the accused Ravi. The DNA reports were
also obtained on the articles seized and sent to the CFSL, New Delhi.
7. After completion of the investigation, Charge Sheet was laid before the
concerned court. Upon the committal of the case to the court of Sessions,
Charges u/s 365/34 IPC, u/s 367/34, u/s 376(2)(g) IPC, u/s 377/34 IPC, u/s
302 IPC and u/s 201/34 IPC were framed against all the three accused on
26.05.2012. Since the accused pleaded not guilty to the said charges, trial
was held.
8. The prosecution had examined 49 witnesses to bring home the guilt of the
accused. The accused were examined u/s. 313 Cr.PC on 27.11.2013
wherein all of them denied the incriminating facts and circumstances put
to them and claimed false implication. One witness was examined on
behalf of the accused Rahul and Ravi in their defence. He was the Legal
Assistant of ‘Nav Bharat Times’ and had brought the issue dated
15.02.2012 of daily newspaper ‘Nav Bharat Times’ Ex.DW1/A.
9. The Trial Court after appreciating the evidence on record adduced by the
prosecution and by the accused, convicted and sentenced them as stated
hereinabove, which has been confirmed by the High Court vide the
impugned order.
10. The present appeals were filed by the accused through the Supreme Court
Legal Services Committee. Considering the facts on record, the Court vide
order dated 05.12.2019 had requested learned Senior Counsel Ms. Sonia
Mathur to appear as an Amicus Curiae. Accordingly learned Amicus
Curiae Ms. Mathur and learned Senior Advocate Mr. A. Sirajudeen,
appearing for the Appellants-accused and learned ASG Ms. Aishwarya
Bhati appearing for the Respondent-state were heard at length.
11. The learned Amicus Curiae Ms. Sonia Mathur and learned Senior
Advocate Mr. Sirajudeen for the appellants broadly made the following
(i)   The identity of any of the Appellants-accused in the alleged
abduction of the victim was not established.
(ii)  The circumstances under which the possession of red
coloured Tata Indica Car was recovered from the appellant
Rahul, and the circumstances under which all the three
accused were arrested, were not proved.
(iii) The recoveries made from the scene of offence allegedly at
the instance of the appellants on 13.02.2021, were also not
proved.
(iv)   The recoveries of articles like broken piece of bumper, wallet
and hair strands allegedly recovered from the place where the
body of the deceased victim was found, were highly doubtful,
as the same were not mentioned by the key witnesses during
the course of their respective depositions.
(v)    There were discrepancies with regard to the photography and
the videography done by the Delhi Police and Haryana Police
and with regard to the position of the arm, visibility of the
jeans lining and mud on the jeans of the deceased and the
presence of a wallet seen in the photographs, which created a
dent in the credibility of the investigation carried by the
prosecution.
(vi)   Recoveries of articles made on 14.02.2012 from the open
places which were easily accessible to the public was not
supported by any independent witnesses.
(vii) The post-mortem report did not prove the time of the death of
the victim, in view of the state in which the body was
discovered.
(viii) The forensic evidence collected against the accused during the
course of investigation was not scientifically and legally
proved and therefore could not be used as a circumstance
against the appellants.
(ix)   The call details record of the accused Rahul and Ravi were
not proved to be incriminatory.
(x)    There was violation of fair trial rights of the accused, as ten
material witnesses were not cross-examined, and many other
crucial witnesses were not adequately examined by the
defence counsel during the course of the trial.
12. The learned ASG Ms. Aishwarya Bhati has made the following
(i)    There being concurrent findings of the facts and convictions
recorded by the Trial Court and the High Court after fully
appreciating the evidence on record, this Court may not
disturb the same considering the gravity of the offences for
which the appellants were charged.
(ii)   The case against Rahul was proved by the prosecution by
examining all material witnesses including the ASI Rajender
Singh who had apprehended him, while he was driving red
coloured Tata Indica Car in question. A jack and spanner and
a strand of hair were found in the said Tata Indica Car and the
jack was found to be stained with blood.
(iii)  DNA profile generated from jack and hair found in the car and
female fraction DNA obtained from the vaginal swab of
Anamika were consistent with each other.
(iv)   The injuries found on the victim Anamika were possible to
have been caused by the jack and spanner found in the car
(v)    A broken piece of bumper found near the dead body of
Anamika was opined to be the piece of bumper of red
coloured Indica Car being driven by Rahul.
(vi)   From the testimony of PW-10 Hari Om, it was established that
the car was with Rahul from 07:45 AM on January 9, 2012 till
around 10:00 AM of February 10, 2012, during the period
when the crime was allegedly committed.
(vii) The semen of Rahul was detected on the seat cover of the
(viii) A wallet containing two ATM cards, a driving licence,
photocopies of school leaving certificates and PAN card, was
found near place where Anamika’s dead body was recovered
and it was proved that it was the wallet of the accused Rahul.
(ix)   The hair strand recovered from the dead body of Anamika
matched with the DNA extracted from the blood sample of
the accused Ravi.
(x)    The accused Ravi was carrying a mobile phone having
telephone no. 8802090923 when he was arrested, and the call
details records showed that during the period Anamika was
removed from Delhi and her body dumped in village Rodai,
the said phone was found around the area of village Rodai.
(xi)   So far as the accused Vinod was concerned, the DNA profile
of the semen extracted from the vaginal swab of Anamika
matched with his DNA profile, and his semen was also
detected from the seat cover of Tata India Car driven by
13. After the arguments on the issue of conviction were concluded, certain
directions were given by this Court to the Respondent-State to place the
report of the Probation Officer relating to the appellants, the report of the
Jail Administration about the nature of the work done by the appellants in
jail. Directions were also issued to the Director VIMHANS to constitute a
suitable team for the psychiatric evaluation of the appellants and to place
the report on record. Accordingly, all the reports have been placed on
record by the concerned authorities. The father of the victim Kunwar Singh
Negi had filed an application being Crl.M.P. No. 5559 of 2015 seeking his
impleadment as a party respondent to enable him to participate in the
proceedings. Another application was also filed by one Yogita Bhayana to
implead her as a party respondent on the ground that she was a support
person of the family of the deceased-victim and activist working in the field
of providing counselling and succour to sexually abused children in Delhi
as well as other states.
14. Having heard the learned counsel for the parties, in the light of the evidence
on record, it cannot be denied that the entire case of prosecution rested on
the circumstantial evidence, and that the victim was raped and brutally
murdered. The Trial Court relying upon the following circumstances as
“proved” convicted and sentenced the Appellants-accused for the charged
“(1) The deceased has been kidnapped in a red colour Tata
Indica car.
(2) The red colour Tata Indica car bearing registration No.
DL 3C AF 4348 belonging to PW-10 was in the custody of
accused Rahul from 07.45 am on 9.2.2012 till 9 a.m. on
10.2.2012 and from 11.2.2012 to 13.2.2012.
(3) The female hair strand was found on the rear seat of the
aforesaid Tata Indica car and DNA generated from it was
found similar to the DNA of the deceased implying that it
was the hair of the deceased.
(4) The DNA generated from the semen spots found on the
seat covers of the aforesaid Tata Indica car was similar to
that of accused Rahul.
(5) The dead body of the deceased was recovered from the
fields of village Rodai at the instance of accused Ravi and
Vinod on 13.2.2012.
(6) A red colour purse containing some cash, ATM cards as
well as PAN card and driving license in the name of Rahul
were found near the dead body of the deceased.
(7) The three accused had pointed out the spot, on which they
had smashed the head of the deceased with a ‘Matka’ in
order to kill her.
(8) A Jack and pana were recovered from the boot of the
aforesaid Tata Indica car bearing registration No. DL 3C AF
4348, which was having blood spots and DNA generated
from the blood spots was found similar to that of the
deceased implying that deceased was hit by said Jack and
(9) The autopsy doctor (PW26) opined that the injuries
found on the dead body of ‘Anamica’ could be possible by
aforesaid Jack and Pana.
(10) A broken piece of bumper of the aforesaid Tata Indica
car bearing registration No. DL 3C AF 4348 was also
recovered from near the dead body of the deceased in the
fields of village Rodai.
(11) The panty of the deceased was got recovered by accused
Vinod from a vacant plot adjacent to house No. RZ-54,
Palam Vihar, Sector-6, Dwarka, belonging to PW-11 where
the three accused were residing as a tenant.
(12) Accused Rahul had got recovered the broken mobile
phone of the deceased from amongst the bushes on the
central verge in front of the road near Karnal Cinema Hall,
near Rajinder Dhaba, Delhi.
(13) The vaginal swab of the deceased was found to have
mixed male DNA profile, which was similar to that of
accused Vinod as well as accused Ravi.
(14) The location of mobile phones of the accused Rahul,
accused Ravi and the deceased was around Jhajhar, Haryana
in the night intervening between 09.2.2012 and 10.2.2012
when the deceased was kidnapped, raped and murdered.”
15. The High Court also believing the same set of circumstances as “proved”
further noted that the two incriminating circumstances of the DNA of a
strand of hair recovered from Anamica’s dead body matching DNA of
Ravi and DNA generated from semen spots found on seat cover of the
Indica car matching DNA profile of Vinod were overlooked by the Trial
16.      The law pertaining to the appreciation of circumstantial evidence is quite
well settled by this Court in catena of decisions. In Sharad Birdhichand
Sarda vs. State of Maharashtra1, this Court after taking note of earlier
decisions had carved out five principles: -
“152. Before discussing the cases relied upon by the High
Court we would like to cite a few decisions on the nature,
character and essential proof required in a criminal case
which rests on circumstantial evidence alone. The most
fundamental and basic decision of this Court
is Hanumant v. State of Madhya Pradesh [AIR 1952 SC 343
: 1952 SCR 1091 : 1953 Cri LJ 129] . This case has been
uniformly followed and applied by this Court in a large
number of later decisions up-to-date, for instance, the cases
of Tufail (Alias) Simmi v. State of Uttar Pradesh [(1969) 3
SCC 198 : 1970 SCC (Cri) 55] and Ramgopal v. State of
may be useful to extract what Mahajan, J. has laid down
in Hanumant case [AIR 1952 SC 343 : 1952 SCR 1091 :
“It is well to remember that in cases where the evidence is of
a circumstantial nature, the circumstances from which the
conclusion of guilt is to be drawn should in the first instance
be fully established, and all the facts so established should
be consistent only with the hypothesis of the guilt of the
accused. Again, the circumstances should be of a conclusive
nature and tendency and they should be such as to exclude
every hypothesis but the one proposed to be proved. In other
words, there must be a chain of evidence so far complete as
not to leave any reasonable ground for a conclusion
consistent with the innocence of the accused and it must be
such as to show that within all human probability the act
must have been done by the accused.”
153. A close analysis of this decision would show that the
following conditions must be fulfilled before a case against
an accused can be said to be fully established:
(1) the circumstances from which the conclusion of guilt is
to be drawn should be fully established.
It may be noted here that this Court indicated that the
circumstances concerned “must or should” and not “may be”
established. There is not only a grammatical but a legal
distinction between “may be proved” and “must be or should
be proved” as was held by this Court in Shivaji Sahabrao
Bobade v. State of Maharashtra [(1973) 2 SCC 793 :
“Certainly, it is a primary principle that the accused must be
and not merely may be guilty before a court can convict and
the mental distance between ‘may be’ and ‘must be’ is long
and divides vague conjectures from sure conclusions.”
(2) the facts so established should be consistent only with the
hypothesis of the guilt of the accused, that is to say, they
should not be explainable on any other hypothesis except
that the accused is guilty,
(3) the circumstances should be of a conclusive nature and
(4) they should exclude every possible hypothesis except the
(5) there must be a chain of evidence so complete as not to
leave any reasonable ground for the conclusion consistent
with the innocence of the accused and must show that in all
human probability the act must have been done by the
154. These five golden principles, if we may say so,
constitute the panchsheel of the proof of a case based on
circumstantial evidence.”
17.      In Padala Veera Reddy vs. State of Andhra Pradesh & Ors2 , it was
“10………. (1) the circumstances from which an inference
of guilt is sought to be drawn, must be cogently and firmly
(2) those circumstances should be of a definite tendency
unerringly pointing towards guilt of the accused;
(3) the circumstances, taken cumulatively, should form a
chain so complete that there is no escape from the conclusion
that within all human probability the crime was committed
by the accused and none else; and
(4) the circumstantial evidence in order to sustain conviction
must be complete and incapable of explanation of any other
hypothesis than that of the guilt of the accused and such
evidence should not only be consistent with the guilt of the
accused but should be inconsistent with his innocence.
(See Gambhir v. State of Maharashtra .”
18.      The said principles have also been followed in Navaneethakrishnan vs.
State by Inspector of Police (2018) 16 SCC 161. Keeping in view the
afore-stated principles, let us examine whether the circumstances relied
upon by the Trial Court and the High Court cogently and firmly established
the guilt of the Appellants-accused.
19.      The first and foremost circumstance relied upon by the prosecution was
with regard to the victim having been kidnapped in a red coloured Tata
Indica Car on 09.02.2012 at about 8:45 p.m. In this regard the prosecution
has relied upon evidence of PW-1 Pooja Rawat, PW-2 Vikas Singh Rawat,
PW-4 Vikas, PW-29 Saraswati and PW-42 Sangeeta. As per the case of the
prosecution, the victim along with PW-1 Pooja Rawat, PW-29 Saraswati
and PW-42 Sangeeta was returning home and when she and her friends
were walking through Hanuman Chowk, a red-coloured Tata Indica car
came from behind and suddenly stopped near them. One boy thereafter
came out of the car and pulled the victim into the car. There were other
three-four persons sitting in the said car. At that time PW-4 Vikas tried to
intervene, but the said boys in the car started quarrelling with him and
thereafter drove out the car along with victim. Though the said story put
forth by the prosecution to an extent, is supported by the concerned
witnesses viz. PW-1 Pooja Rawat, PW-4 Vikas, PW-29 Saraswati, and
PW-42 Sangeeta, none of the said witnesses had identified the accused
sitting in the Court during the course of their respective depositions. Even
the PW-4 Vikas, who had some altercations with the boys attempting to
kidnap the victim also could not identify any of the accused sitting in the
Court during the course of his deposition and say that the accused were the
boys with whom he had the altercations as they were kidnapping the victim.
Further, the PW-1 Pooja Rawat stated that the Appellants-accused had
covered their faces, whereas PW-29 Saraswati and PW-4 Vikas stated that
the faces of the accused could not be recognized because of darkness. PW-
2 Vikas Singh Rawat who happened to be the brother of PW-1 Pooja Rawat
and whose house was situated near Hanuman Chowk had immediately
come out of the house and had stated to have seen the red coloured Indica
car going towards Tajpur. The said witness also therefore could not identify
the persons who had kidnapped the victim. The PW-8 Kunwar Singh Negi,
father of the deceased had stated that his daughter was kidnapped on
09.02.2012 by some unknown persons when she was returning from
Gurgaon along with her friends, however, he having not witnessed the
incident, also could not identify the accused. There was no T.I. parade
conducted by any of the Investigating Officers during the course of their
respective investigations.
20. From the said evidence of the concerned witnesses, it clearly transpires that
neither any T.I. Parade was conducted by the investigating officer during
the course of investigation for the identification of the accused, nor any of
the witnesses had identified the accused during their respective depositions
before the Court. Therefore, the very identity of the Appellants -accused
having not been duly established, the entire case of the prosecution falls
flat on the very first circumstance having not been duly proved by any
evidence much less clinching evidence, against the Appellants-accused.
21. The next important circumstance relied upon by the prosecution was the
arrest of the accused Rahul with red coloured Indica car on 13.02.2012.
Again, turning to the case of prosecution, it appears that after the alleged
incident of kidnapping, an information was received by the Police Station
Chhawla, New Delhi through call at 21:18 hours on 09.02.2012 to the
effect that a girl was kidnapped in a red-coloured Tata Indica Car near
Hanuman Chowk, Qutub Vihar, Chhawla. The said information was
recorded as DD No.27A at the said police station. On receving the said
information S.I. Prakash Chand (PW-45) who was posted at P.S. Chhawla,
along with constable Rakesh had gone to the spot at Hanuman Chowk,
where they met the complainant- Saraswati. She gave her statement with
regard to the alleged incident and on the basis of her statement, the FIR
was got registered under Section 363 IPC by SI Prakash Chand. Thereafter
on 13.02.2012 when the investigation was entrusted to the SHO, P.S.
Chhawla, Inspector Sandeep Gupta (PW-48), the ASI Rajinder Singh from
P.S. Sector-23, Dwarka (PW-12) produced the accused-Rahul and one red
coloured Indica Car bearing Registration No. DL 3C AF 4348 stating that
the accused Rahul was found roaming in the said car near Metro station,
22. As regards the arrest of the accused-Rahul, PW-12 ASI Rajinder Singh had
stated before the Court that the accused-Rahul was seen driving the red
Indica Car, and he looked perplexed; when he asked for the documents of
the said vehicle, the accused-Rahul could not produce them and therefore
he (PW-12) apprehended Rahul and handed over his custody to the SHO
at P.S. Chhawla. The PW-12 ASI Rajinder had tried to explain that there
was a message from the Control Room that a girl was abducted in a red
coloured Indica Car and the police had to apprehend the said vehicle and
to report to the concerned SHO, and therefore he apprehended Rahul. Thus,
the accused Rahul was apprehended because he was driving one red Indica
Car. Pertinently, none of the witnesses examined by the prosecution had
identified the Indica Car which was allegedly being driven by Rahul on
13.02.2012. P.W-29, the complainant Saraswati had admitted in her cross-
examination that she could not say with certainty that it was the same car
in which the victim was kidnapped. None of the witnesses had seen even
the registration number of the car in which the victim was kidnapped.
23. Now, as per the further case of the prosecution, the accused-Rahul gave a
disclosure statement (Ex. PW-39/B) before Inspector Sandeep Gupta on
the basis of which the other accused Vinod and Ravi were brought to the
police station by the beat constables, and they were also arrested at 14:45
and 15:00 hours respectively. They also gave their disclosure statements
(Ex. P.W-39/A and Ex. PW-39/C) before P-1 Sandeep Gupta. The said beat
constables were not examined by the prosecution before the Trial Court.
The non-examination of the said beat constables has created a cloud of
doubt in the story of the arrests of the accused, as in the further statements,
recorded under Section 313 of Cr.P.C., the accused-Rahul had stated that
Ravi was lifted from his house, and when he (i.e., Rahul) reached to the
police station in the evening to enquire about Ravi, he was arrested and the
car was seized. The accused-Vinod and Ravi have also stated that they were
picked up from their home. Thus, the circumstances under which the
accused were arrested and the car was seized have also raised serious
doubts in the story put-forth by the prosecution.
24. Curiously, the evidence with regard to the time as who reached to the place
of incident first where the body of the victim was lying, is also not clear.
PW-46 ASI Balwan Singh P.S. Rodai, Haryana, stated that on 13.02.2012
on the receipt of DD No. 24, he along with head constable Vinod and head
constable Aman Kumar had reached to the fields near Karawara Railway
Phatak, Rewari, where he found that SHO P.S. Chhawla, Sandeep Gupta
(PW-48) and other staff members were already there. In his cross-
examination PW-46 stated that he received the DD No. 24 at about 11.30
a.m or 12.00 noon, and he had reached to the spot at around 4.30 p.m. P.W.
48 P1 Sandeep Gupta stated that on 13.02.2012, after arrest of all the three
accused and visiting the spot from where the alleged kidnapping had taken
place, he along with his team and the two accused Ravi and Vinod, leaving
Rahul at the police station, had gone to P.S. Rodai, Distt. Rewari, Haryana
he further stated that thereafter, on the accused Ravi and Vinod having
indicated, they all reached to the spot i.e., the field where the dead body of
the victim was lying. Since a PCR van of P.S. Rodai was parked there, an
information was sent to P.S Rodai through PCR officials and thereafter
ASI Balwant Singh along with his staff reached the spot. Thus, there are
contradictions in the respective depositions of P.W.-46 and P.W.-48 as to
how and when they reached to the spot where the dead body of the victim
was found lying. Though the said DD No. 24 was an extremely crucial
piece of evidence, the said document was not got exhibited as an evidence
by the prosecution.
25. At this juncture, it may be noted that the trial court had allowed the entire
disclosure statements of the three accused to be admitted in evidence by
exhibiting the same as Ex. PW-39/B, PW-41/B and PW-41/C. The said
statements were recorded by the PW-48, Sandeep Gupta, when they were
in police custody. The said statements being in nature of the confessions
before the police were hit by Section 25 of the Evidence Act. The law in
this regard is very clear that the confession before the police officer by the
accused when he is in police custody, cannot be called an extra-judicial
confession. If a confession is made by the accused before the police, and a
portion of such confession leads to the recovery of any incriminating
material, such portion alone would be admissible under Section 27 of the
Evidence Act, and not the entire confessional statements. In the instant
case, therefore the trial court had committed gross error in exhibiting the
entire disclosure statements of the accused recorded by the PW-48 P1
Sandeep Kumar Gupta, for being read in evidence. Though, the
information furnished to the Investigating Officer leading to the discovery
of the place of the offence would be admissible to the extent indicated in
Section 27 read with Section 8 of the Evidence Act, but not the entire
disclosure statement in the nature of confession recorded by the police
officer.
26. This takes us to the next circumstance with regard to the alleged discovery
of incriminating articles on 13.02.2021 namely, the broken piece of
bumper, wallet containing the documents connecting the accused-Rahul
etc. In this regard, the evidence of the Delhi Police and the Haryana Police
Officers would be relevant. Though PW-32 Head Constable Omkar Singh
of P.S. Chhawla and PW-36 ASI Atar Singh, in charge of Crime Team
South-West District, New Delhi, stated about the recovery of the said
incriminating articles, PW-37, PW-38, PW-39 and PW-41 who were also
there at the spot did not make any mention about the said articles. Again
PW-31 photographer called at the instance of P.S. Rodai also did not state
about the said articles. The other non-official witnesses i.e. PW-3, PW-7,
PW-8 and PW-14 also did not state anything about such discoveries or
recoveries. The prosecution had also not proved by cogent evidence that
the broken piece of bumper lying near the dead body of the victim was of
the red coloured indica car seized from the accused-Rahul. Further, the
seizure memo of the wallet (Exhibit 34/A) mentioned only that one red
coloured wallet containing Rs.365 and a list of things was seized. There
was no mention about any document in the seizure memo which could
connect the accused Rahul. If the ATM cards, driving licence, photocopies
of school leaving certificates and PAN card connecting the accused Rahul,
were found from the said wallet, no Investigating Officer would commit
such a blunder of not mentioning them in the seizure memo. The accused-
Rahul in his further statement under Section 313 had stated that the said
articles were taken away from him at the police station.
27. The recovery of a strand of hair found from the body of the deceased by
ASI Balwan Singh as per the Seizure Memo (Exhibit 34/A) is also highly
doubtful, inasmuch as the same was allegedly found from the body of the
deceased which was lying in the open field for about three days and three
nights. The PW-8 father of the deceased and PW-3 and PW-7 neighbours
of the deceased who had identified the dead body of the victim had not
stated anything about the articles lying near the dead body. The learned
advocates for the appellants had also drawn the attention of the Court with
regard to number of inconsistencies and contradictions appearing in the
evidence of the Haryana Police, Delhi Police and also in the testimonies of
the formal witnesses, which render the entire evidence with regard to the
discovery and recovery as also seizure of the incriminating articles, very
unreliable. The seizure of the articles like burnt ash, underwear of the
deceased etc. on 14.02.2012 at the instance of the accused were also not
duly proved by the prosecution. The said articles were sent to the CFSL for
examination however, no conclusive opinion was given by the CFSL to
establish their link with the accused.
28. The next circumstance relied upon by the prosecution was the alleged
recovery of the phone of the deceased at the instance of the accused Rahul
from the bushes on the road divider opposite to Rajinder Dhaba near Kamal
Cinema. Though PW-8 Kunwar Singh Negi, father of the deceased had
stated that mobile phone no.9540594640 was in his name and was used by
his daughter, he was not shown the phone instrument for the purpose of
identity. The call details record of the said phone being electronic record,
was also not proved in terms of Section 65B of the Evidence Act. Hence,
this part of the evidence also does not take the case of the prosecution any
further.
29. In the instant case, the alleged incident of kidnapping had taken place on
09.02.2012 and the dead body of the victim was found on 13.02.2012.
Hence, the time of death was also very much significant, however in view
of the state in which the dead body was found, the Post-Mortem Report
Ex.26/A is also not clear about the timing as to when the death had
occurred. The Post-Mortem report stated the time of death to be 72 to 96
hours i.e. between 10.02.2012 to 11.02.2012, as the post-mortem had taken
on 14.02.2012. However, as per the case of the prosecution, death would
have taken place on the intervening night of 09.02.2012 to 10.02.2012. The
body of the deceased also did not show any signs of putrefaction. It is
highly unlikely that the dead body would have remained in the field for
three days without being noticed by anybody.
30. The learned Senior Advocates appearing for the appellants have also
rightly drawn the attention of the Court to the timings and the manner in
which the samples were collected during the course of post-mortem of the
deceased, to submit that the PW-48 P1 Sandeep Kumar was present at the
hospital when the post-mortem was conducted on 14.02.2012, and
therefore there was no reason to collect the samples from the body of the
deceased on 16.02.2012. The collection and sealing of the samples during
the MLC of the accused which had taken place on 14.02.2012 at the RTMR
Hospital, Jaffarpur also does not inspire confidence. The story of blood
stains and semens found on the seat covers of the Indica Car seized on
13.02.2012 and sent to the CFSL for examination also appears to be highly
improbable and unreliable. There is no clear evidence as to who was in
custody of the said car after its seizure till it was sent to CFSL for
examination and as to whether the car was sealed during the said period.
31.      The learned Amicus Curiae has also assailed the forensic evidence i.e., the
report regarding the DNA Profiling dated 18.04.2012 (Exhibit P-23/1)
giving incriminating findings. She vehemently submitted that apart from
the fact that the collection of the samples sent for examination itself was
very doubtful, the said forensic evidence was neither scientifically nor
legally proved and could not have been used as a circumstance against the
Appellants-accused. The Court finds substance in the said submissions
made by the Amicus Curiae. The DNA evidence is in the nature of opinion
evidence as envisaged under Section 45 and like any other opinion
evidence, its probative value varies from case to case. In this regard a very
pertinent observations made by this Court in case of Manoj and Ors. Vs.
State of Madhya Pradesh3 deserve to be made. This Court has in detail
dealt with the issue of DNA profiling methodology and statistical analysis,
as also the collection and preservation of DNA evidence. The relevant
paragraphs read as under:-
“138. During the hearing, an article published by the Central
Forensic Science Laboratory, Kolkata was relied upon. The
relevant extracts of the article are reproduced below:
“Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is genetic material
present in the nuclei of cells of living organisms. An average
human body is composed of about 100 trillion of cells. DNA
is present in the nucleus of cell as double helix, supercoiled
to form chromosomes along with Intercalated proteins.
Twenty-three pairs of chromosomes present In each
nucleated cells and an individual Inherits 23 chromosomes
from mother and 23 from father transmitted through the ova
and sperm respectively. At the time of each cell division,
chromosomes replicate and one set goes to each daughter
cell. All Information about Internal organisation, physical
characteristics, and physiological functions of the body is
encoded in DNA molecules in a language (sequence) of
alphabets of four nucleotides or bases: Adenine (A),
Guanine (G), Thymine (T) and Cytosine (C) along with
sugar-phosphate backbone. A human haploid cell contains 3
billion bases approx. All cells of the body have exactly same
DNA but it varies from individual to Individual in the
sequence of nucleotides. Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA)
found in large number of copies in the mitochondria is
circular, double stranded, 16,569 base pair in length and
shows maternal inheritance. It is particularly useful in the
study of people related through the maternal line. Also being
in large number of copies than nuclear DNA, it can be used
in the analysis of degraded samples. Similarly, the Y
chromosome shows paternal inheritance and is employed to
trace the male lineage and resolve DNA from males in sexual
assault mixtures.
Only 0.1 % of DNA (about 3 million bases) differs from one
person to another. Forensic DNA Scientists analyse only few
variable regions to generate a DNA profile of an individual
to compare with biological clue materials or control samples.
DNA profile is generated from the body fluids, stains, and
other biological specimen recovered from evidence and the
results are compared with the results obtained from reference
samples. Thus, a link among victim(s) and/or suspect(s) with
one another or with crime scene can be established. DNA
Profiling Is a complex process of analyses of some highly
variable regions of DNA. The variable areas of DNA are
termed Genetic Markers. The current genetic markers of
choice for forensic purposes are Short Tandem Repeats
(STRs). Analysis of a set of 15 STRs employing Automated
DNA Sequencer gives a DNA Profile unique to an
Individual (except monozygotic twin). Similarly, STRs
present on Y chromosome (Y-STR) can also be used in
sexual assault cases or determining paternal lineage. In cases
of sexual assaults, Y-STRs are helpful in detection of male
profile even in the presence of high level of female portion
or in case of azoo11permic or vasectomized” male. Cases In
which DNA had undergone environmental stress and
biochemical degradation, min lSTRs can be used for over
routine STR because of shorter amplicon size.
DNA Profiling is a complicated process and each sequential
step involved in generating a profile can vary depending on
the facilities available In the laboratory. The analysis
principles, however, remain similar, which include:
1. isolation, purification & quantitation of DNA
2. amplification of selected genetic markers
3. visualising the fragments and genotyping
4. statistical analysis & interpretation.
In mtDNA analysis, variations in Hypervariable Region I &
II (HVR I & II) are detected by sequencing and comparing
results with control samples:….
Atypical DNA case involves comparison of evidence
samples, such as semen from a rape, and known or reference
samples, such as a blood sample from a suspect. Generally,
there are three possible outcomes of profile comparison:
1) Match: If the DNA profiles obtained from the two samples
are indistinguishable, they are said to have matched.
2) Exclusion: If the comparison of profiles shows
differences, it can only be explained by the two samples
originating from different sources.
3) Inconclusive: The data does not support a conclusion Of
the three possible outcomes, only the “match” between
samples needs to be supported by statistical calculation.
Statistics attempt to provide meaning to the match. The
match statistics are usually provided as an estimate of the
Random Match Probability (RMP) or in other words, the
frequency of the particular DNA profile in a population.
In case of paternity/maternity testing, exclusion at more than
two loci is considered exclusion. An allowance of 1 or 2 loci
possible mutations should be taken Into consideration while
reporting a match. Paternity of Maternity Indices and
Likelihood Ratios are calculated further to support the
If DNA evidence is not properly documented, collected,
packaged, and preserved, It will not meet the legal and
scientific requirements for admissibility in. a court of law.
Because extremely small samples of DNA can be used as
evidence, greater attention to contamination issues is
necessary while locating, collecting, and preserving DNA
evidence can be contaminated when DNA from another
source gets mixed with DNA relevant to the case. This can
happen when someone sneezes or coughs over the evidence
or touches his/her mouth, nose, or other part of the face and
then touches area that may contain the DNA to be tested. The
exhibits having biological specimen, which can establish
link among victim(s), suspect(s), scene of crime for solving
the case should be Identified, preserved, packed and sent for
139. In an earlier judgment, R v. Dohoney & Adams the UK
Court of Appeal laid down the following guidelines
concerning the procedure for introducing DNA evidence in
trials: (1) the scientist should adduce the evidence of the
DNA comparisons together with his calculations of the
random occurrence ratio; (2) whenever such evidence is to
be adduced, the Crown (prosecution) should serve upon the
defence details as to how the calculations have been carried
out, which are sufficient for the defence to scrutinise the
basis of the calculations; (3) the Forensic Science Service
should make available to a defence expert, if requested, the
databases upon which the calculations have been based.
140. The Law Commission of India in its report, observed as
“DNA evidence involves comparison between genetic
material thought to come from the person whose identity is
in issue and a sample of genetic material from a known
person. If the samples do not ‘match’, then this will prove a
lack of identity between the known person and the person
from whom the unknown sample originated. If the samples
match, that does not mean the identity is conclusively
proved. Rather, an expert will be able to derive from a
database of DNA samples, an approximate number
reflecting how often a similar DNA “profile” or
“fingerprint” is found. It may be, for example, that the
relevant profile is found in 1 person in every 100,000: This
is described as the ‘random occurrence ratio’ (Phipson
Thus, DNA may be more useful for purposes of investigation
but not for raising any presumption of identity in a court of
141. In Dharam Deo Yadav v. State of UP this court
discussed the reliability of DNA evidence in a criminal trial,
“The DNA stands for deoxyribonucleic acid, which is the
biological blueprint of every life. DNA is made-up of a
double standard structure consisting of a deoxyribose sugar
and phosphate backbone, cross-linked with two types of
nucleic acids referred to as adenine and guanine, purines and
thymine and cytosine pyrimidines…..DNA usually can be
obtained from any biological material such as blood, semen,
saliva, hair, skin, bones, etc. The question as to whether
DNA tests are virtually infallible may be a moot question,
but the fact remains that such test has come to stay and is
being used extensively in the investigation of crimes and the
Court often accepts the views of the experts, especially when
cases rest on circumstantial evidence. More than half a
century, samples of human DNA began to be used in the
criminal justice system. Of course, debate lingers over the
safeguards that should be required in testing samples and in
presenting the evidence in Court. DNA profile, however, is
consistently held to be valid and reliable, but of course, it
depends on the quality control and quality assurance
procedures in the laboratory.”
142. The US Supreme Court, in District Attorney's Office
for the Third Judicial District v. Osborne, dealt with a post-
conviction claim to access evidence, at the behest of the
convict, who wished to prove his innocence, through new
DNA techniques. It was observed, in the context of the facts,
“Modern DNA testing can provide powerful new evidence
unlike anything known before. Since its first use in criminal
investigations in the mid-1980s, there have been several
major advances in DNA technology, culminating in STR
technology. It is now often possible to determine whether a
biological tissue matches a suspect with near certainty.
While of course many criminal trials proceed without any
forensic and scientific testing at all, there is no technology
comparable to DNA testing for matching tissues when such
evidence is at issue. DNA testing has exonerated wrongly
convicted people, and has confirmed the convictions of
many others.”
143. Several decisions of this court - Pantangi Balarama
Venkata Ganesh v. State of Andhra Pradesh, Santosh Kumar
Singh v. State Through CBI, Inspector of Police, Tamil
Nadu v. John David, Krishan Kumar Malik v. State of
Haryana, Surendra Koli v. State of Uttar Pradesh,
and Sandeep v. State of Uttar Pradesh, Rajkumar v. State of
Madhya Pradesh and Mukesh v. State for NCT of
Delhi have dealt with the increasing importance of DNA
evidence. This court has also emphasized the need for
assuring quality control, about the samples, as well as the
technique for testing-in Anil v. State of Maharashtra
“7. Deoxyribonucleic acid, or DNA, is a molecule that
encodes the genetic information in all living organisms.
DNA genotype can be obtained from any biological material
such as bone, blood, semen, saliva, hair, skin, etc. Now, for
several years, DNA profile has also shown a tremendous
impact on forensic investigation. Generally, when DNA
profile of a sample found at the scene of crime matches with
DNA profile of the suspect, it can generally be concluded
that both samples have the same biological origin. DNA
profile is valid and reliable, but variance in a particular result
depends on the quality control and quality procedure in the
laboratory.”
32.  It is true that PW-23 Dr. B.K. Mohapatra, Senior Scientific Officer
(Biology) of CFSL, New Delhi had stepped into the witness box and his
report regarding DNA profiling was exhibited as Ex. PW-23/A, however
mere exhibiting a document, would not prove its contents. The record
shows that all the samples relating to the accused and relating to the
deceased were seized by the Investigating Officer on 14.02.2012 and
16.02.2012; and they were sent to CFSL for examination on 27.02.2012.
During this period, they remained in the Malkhana of the Police Station.
Under the circumstances, the possibility of tampering with the samples
collected also could not be ruled out. Neither the Trial Court nor the High
Court has examined the underlying basis of the findings in the DNA reports
nor have they examined the fact whether the techniques were reliably
applied by the expert. In absence of such evidence on record, all the reports
with regard to the DNA profiling become highly vulnerable, more
particularly when the collection and sealing of the samples sent for
examination were also not free from suspicion.
33. Thus, having regard to the totality of circumstances and the evidence on
record, it is difficult to hold that the prosecution had proved the guilt of the
accused by adducing cogent and clinching evidence. As per the settled
legal position, in order to sustain conviction, the circumstances taken
cumulatively should form a chain so complete that there is no escape from
the conclusion that within all human probability, the crime was committed
by the accused only and none else. The circumstantial evidence must be
complete and incapable of explanation of any other hypothesis than that of
the guilt of the accused and such evidence should not only be consistent
with the guilt of the accused but should be inconsistent with his innocence.
As demonstrated earlier, the evidence with regard to the arrest of the
Appellants-accused, their identification, discoveries and recoveries of the
incriminating articles, identity of the Indica Car, the seizures and sealing
of the articles and collection of samples, the medical and scientific
evidence, the report of DNA profiling, the evidence with regard to the
CDRs etc. were not proved by the prosecution by leading, cogent, clinching
and clear evidence much less unerringly pointing the guilt of the accused.
The prosecution has to bring home the charges levelled against them
beyond reasonable doubt, which the prosecution has failed to do in the
instant case, resultantly, the Court is left with no alternative but to acquit
the accused, though involved in a very heinous crime. It may be true that
if the accused involved in the heinous crime go unpunished or are
acquitted, a kind of agony and frustration may be caused to the society in
general and to the family of the victim in particular, however the law does
not permit the Courts to punish the accused on the basis of moral conviction
or on suspicion alone. No conviction should be based merely on the
apprehension of indictment or condemnation over the decision rendered.
Every case has to be decided by the Courts strictly on merits and in
accordance with law without being influenced by any kind of outside moral
pressures or otherwise.
34.      The Court is constrained to make these observations as the Court has
noticed many glaring lapses having occurred during the course of the trial.
It has been noticed from the record that out of the 49 witnesses examined
by the prosecution, 10 material witnesses were not cross-examined and
many other important witnesses were not adequately cross-examined by
the defence counsel. It may be reminded that Section 165 of the Indian
Evidence Act confers unbridled powers upon the trial courts to put any
question at any stage to the witnesses to elicit the truth. As observed in
several decisions, the Judge is not expected to be a passive umpire but is
supposed to actively participate in the trial, and to question the witnesses
to reach to a correct conclusion. This Court while not accepting the
submission that it was improper for the Court to have interjected during the
course of cross-examination of the witness, had observed in the case of
State of Rajasthan vs. Ani alias Hanif and Others4 thus: -
“11. We are unable to appreciate the above criticism.
Section 165 of the Evidence Act confers vast and
unrestricted powers on the trial court to put “any question he
pleases, in any form, at any time, of any witness, or of the
parties, about any fact relevant or irrelevant” in order to
discover relevant facts. The said section was framed by
lavishly studding it with the word “any” which could only
have been inspired by the legislative intent to confer
unbridled power on the trial court to use the power whenever
he deems it necessary to elicit truth. Even if any such
question crosses into irrelevancy the same would not
transgress beyond the contours of powers of the court. This
is clear from the words “relevant or irrelevant” in Section
165. Neither of the parties has any right to raise objection to
any such question.
12. Reticence may be good in many circumstances, but a
Judge remaining mute during trial is not an ideal situation.
A taciturn Judge may be the model caricatured in public
mind. But there is nothing wrong in his becoming active or
dynamic during trial so that criminal justice being the end
could be achieved. Criminal trial should not turn out to be a
bout or combat between two rival sides with the Judge
performing the role only of a spectator or even an umpire to
pronounce finally who won the race. A Judge is expected to
actively participate in the trial, elicit necessary materials
from witnesses in the appropriate context which he feels
necessary for reaching the correct conclusion. There is
nothing which inhibits his power to put questions to the
witnesses, either during chief examination or cross-
examination or even during re-examination to elicit truth.
The corollary of it is that if a Judge felt that a witness has
committed an error or a slip it is the duty of the Judge to
ascertain whether it was so, for, to err is human and the
chances of erring may accelerate under stress of nervousness
during cross-examination. Criminal justice is not to be
founded on erroneous answers spelled out by witnesses
during evidence-collecting process. It is a useful exercise for
trial Judge to remain active and alert so that errors can be
13. In this context it is apposite to quote the observations of
Chinnappa Reddy, J. in Ram Chander v. State of
1981 SC 1036] : (SCC p. 193, para 2)
“The adversary system of trial being what it is, there is an
unfortunate tendency for a Judge presiding over a trial to
assume the role of a referee or an umpire and to allow the
trial to develop into a contest between the prosecution and
the defence with the inevitable distortions flowing from
combative and competitive elements entering the trial
procedure. If a criminal court is to be an effective instrument
in dispensing justice, the presiding Judge must cease to be a
spectator and a mere recording machine. He must become a
participant in the trial by evincing intelligent active interest
by putting questions to witnesses in order to ascertain the
truth.”
35. In the instant case, material witnesses examined by the prosecution having
not been either cross-examined or adequately examined, and the trial court
also having acted as a passive umpire, we find that the Appellants-accused
were deprived of their rights to have a fair trial, apart from the fact that the
truth also could not be elicited by the trial court. We leave it to the wisdom
and discretion of the trial courts to exercise their powers under Section 165
of the Indian Evidence Act for eliciting the truth in the cases before them,
howsoever heinous or otherwise they may be.
36.  Having said that and for the reasons stated above, the judgments and orders
of conviction and sentence passed by the trial court and the High Court are
set aside. The Appellants-accused are acquitted from the charges levelled
against them by giving them a benefit of doubt, and they are directed to be
set free forthwith if not required in any other case. The appeals deserve to
be allowed accordingly.
37.  It is needless to say that in view of Section 357(A) Cr.PC, the family
members of the deceased- victim would be entitled to the compensation
even though the accused have been acquitted. Hence, while allowing these
appeals and acquitting the Appellants- accused, we direct that the parents
of the victim would be entitled to the compensation, if not awarded so far
by the Delhi State Legal Services Authority, as may be permissible in
accordance with law.
38.   In view of the above, the appeals stand allowed. All pending applications
also stand disposed of.
39.   Before parting, we place on record the valuable assistance rendered by the
Amicus Curiae Ms. Sonia Mathur and the learned Senior Advocates and
their associates appearing for the parties.
