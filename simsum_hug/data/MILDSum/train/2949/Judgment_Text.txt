The petitioner has sought for issuance of writ in the nature
of mandamus directing respondent nos.1 and 2 to consider the
representation at Annexure-'J' and 'J1' and direct respondent
nos.1 and 2 to issue an order of appointment to the post of
Assistant Professor, Department of Architecture in Bangalore
University as regards the vacant post under the category
2. It is submitted that the respondent University had
invited applications for recruitment as per the Notification at
Annexure-'C' dated 21.03.2018.      Insofar as the specific post
which is the subject matter of the present writ petition ie.,
Assistant Professor, Department of Architecture, the appropriate
reservation as indicated in the notification was two posts
for Scheduled Tribe (Other Candidate) and (Women) [ST (O) &
(W) for brevity]. It is submitted that insofar as recruitment to
the Open category is concerned, recruitment was completed
however, the recruitment for the category of ST (W) could not be
concluded as no candidates has applied for the post earmarked
for the particular category. It is further submitted that in the
event recruitment could not be concluded, respondent-authority
ought to have taken note of the Government Order at Annexure-
'H' which provides at Clause (7) that in the event as regards to
the post, eligible women are not available, such reserved post
could be filled up by eligible male candidates of the same
3.     It is submitted that the petitioner came to know
regarding non-submission of application with respect to the post
of Assistant Professor (Women) under the category of ST by
virtue of the communication of the Bangalore University at
Annexure-'G' on 08.01.2021 and soon thereafter petitioner has
made a representation on 09.01.2021 as per Annexure-'J'.
4.   It is further submitted by the learned Senior Counsel
Sri.A.G.Shivanna appearing for the petitioner that subsequent
notification by the University does not make any provision for
filling of this post as notified on 14.06.2021. Accordingly, it is
submitted that in terms of Section 53 (8) of the Karnataka State
Universities Act, the Board of Appointment shall follow the orders
issued by the State Government from time to time and the
Government Order at Annexure-'H' must be construed to be an
order issued by the State Government in terms of Section 53 (8)
of the Act.
5.  It is further submitted that the vertical reservation is
the category of ST while the horizontal reservation is that of
woman and taking note of the applicable Government Order, in
the   event    suitable  woman     candidate   as  regards  vertical
reservation of ST is not found, in terms of the Government Order
if the horizontal reservation is shifted to the men, there would be
no prejudice that would be caused to the vertical reservation.
6.  The learned Government Advocate upon direction by
the court has filed an affidavit of the Under Secretary,
Department of Personnel and Administrative Reforms, Vidhana
Soudha and the stand taken by the Government is that the
Government Order at Annexure-'H' dated 22.11.2002 is required
to be adhered to by the appointing authority 'in all the cadres'.
It is further observed that sub-rule (1B) of Rule 9 of the
Rules", for short) points out that vacancies set apart to the
extent of 33% shall be filled up from amongst the category of
General Merit, Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes and each of
the categories among the other backward classes by women.
However, it is submitted that the said Recruitment Rule has a
proviso which states that if sufficient number of eligible women
candidates are not available, to the extent of thirty-three
percent, the unfilled vacancies shall be filled by men candidates
belonging to the same category.
7. It is further submitted by the learned AGA that sub-rule
(1B)   of  Rule    9  of  the  Karnataka   Civil Service  (General
Recruitment) Rules, 1977 must be read along with Annexure-'H'.
Accordingly, it is submitted that the University is required to
follow the Government Order at Annexure-'H'.
8. Learned Counsel Sri.Rajendrakumar Sungay appearing
for the University has contended that the Government Order at
Annexure-'H' is not applicable insofar as the present recruitment
notification is in terms of the Karnataka State Civil Services
(Unfilled vacancies reserved for the persons belonging to the
Scheduled      castes    and   the   Scheduled    tribes)  (Special
Recruitment) Rules, 2001 and also the Karnataka State Civil
Services (Unfilled vacancies reserved for the persons belonging
to the Scheduled castes and the Scheduled tribes) (Special
9.  It  is further  contended    that   in the  recruitment
notification at Annexure-'C', there is a reference to the Special
Recruitment Rules and there is no reference to the Government
Order at Annexure-'H'. Accordingly, it cannot be submitted that
Annexure-'H' is not applicable insofar as filling up of post under
the Special Recruitment Rules of 2001.
10. It is further submitted that the direction by the
Government need not be followed if it is not backed by any
statute.   Reliance  is placed   on  the   judgment   reported  in
Dr.Parappa Shankarappa & Others v. The Secretary to
KAR 282). It is further submitted that filing up of the post by
ST (Men) would result in injustice to the women category.
11. Heard both sides.
12. It must be noted that sub-rule (1B) of Rule 9 of the
Karnataka Civil Service (General Recruitment) Rules, 1977 is as
"(1B). Notwithstanding anything contained in the
rules of recruitment specially made in respect of any
service or post, in all direct recruitment [thirty three
percent] of vacancies set apart for that method of
each of the categories of General Merit, Scheduled
Castes, Scheduled Tribes and each of the categories
among the other Backward Classes shall, subject to
any general instructions that may be issued by the
Government regarding the manner of appointment,
be filled from among women candidates;
Provided, that if sufficient number of eligible
women candidates are not available, to the extent of
thirty three percent, the unfilled vacancies shall be
filled by men candidates belonging to the same
Provided further that nothing in this rule shall
prevent the women candidates from competing and
for being considered against Sixty Seven percent of
direct recruitment vacancies, if selected on the basis
of merit.
Provided also that the Government may, by
Notification exclude any service of post from the
application of the provision of this sub-rule.
13. The Government Order at Annexure-'H' makes it clear
at Clause 7 as follows:
ªÀÄ»¼ÉAiÀÄjUÉ «ÄÃ¸À°j¹zÀ jPÀÛ ¸ÁÜ£U          À ½À UÉ CºÀð ªÀÄ»¼Á
C¨sÀåyðUÀ¼ÀÄ ®¨sÀåªÁUÀ¢zÀÝ°è CAvÀºÀ jPÀÛ ¸ÁÜ£U       À ¼À £
14. It must be noted that as per Recruitment Notification
at Annexure-'C' the post of Assistant Professor of Department of
Architecture is to be filled up under the main Category of vertical
reservation of Scheduled Tribe (ST) and horizontal reservation as
regards one post with respect to women and the other post is
reserved 'Open' for the same category.                        It is accordingly to be
construed that the vertical reservation is of ST while horizontal
reservation is as regards category of women. The Government
Order at Annexure-'H' as rightly contended by the learned Senior
Counsel appearing for the petitioner is to be treated to be a
direction of the State Government under Section 53 (8) of the
Section 53 (8) reads as hereunder:
(8) In preparing the list under sub-section (7),
the Board of Appointment shall follow the orders
issued by the State Government from time to time in
the matter of reservation appointments and posts,
for the persons belonging to Scheduled Castes,
Scheduled Tribes and Other Backward Classes.
15. It must be noted that reliance is placed also on a letter
dated 09.01.2021 whereby the Government as regards the
matter pending in W.P.No.21973/2019 had referred to the same
Government Order and observed that the said Government Order
was applicable even with respect to recruitment in the case of
Karnataka State Civil Services (Unfilled Vacancies Reserved for
the  Persons belonging     to the     Scheduled  Castes  and the
Scheduled Tribes) (Special Recruitment) Rules, 2001. The said
submission and reference requires to be accepted which is also
the same stand of the State Government.
16. Though the learned counsel for the University has
contended that the Government Order at Annexure-'H' is not
applicable insofar as recruitment under the Special Recruitment
Rules is concerned, we find that such submission deserves to be
rejected as the Government Order at Annexure-'H' does not
make any such distinction and would be applicable whether it is
recruitment under the General Recruitment Rules or Recruitment
as regards backlog vacancies under the Special Recruitment
Rules. The direction under the notification at Annexure-'H' being
a direction under Section 53 (8) requires to be accepted by the
University.     The reliance on the judgment in Dr.Parappa
Shankarappa & Others (supra) is misplaced as the present
direction by the State finds its origin in the relevant recruitment
rules referred to in Para 12.           It must also be noted that
recruitment to other post having been completed and as
contended by the        petitioner a subsequent notification for
recruitment also having been made, there is no notification for
recruitment as regards category of ST (Women).         If that being
so, non-filling of the post for ST under the vertical reservation of
ST by other eligible women or in the absence by men would
prejudice the rights of those under ST Category. Wherever the
horizontal reservation of eligible candidates are not found and as
provided under the recruitment Rule 9 (b) referred to above as
well as Government Order at Annexure-'H', it is the duty of the
authorities concerned to then have a vertical reservation filled in
terms of the Government Order by ST (Women).
17. Accordingly, the respondent No.1 University is directed
to take note of the Government Order at Annexure-'H' and
proceed forthwith to make an order of appointment.          The said
process is to be completed within a period of three months from
the date of receipt of certified copy of this order.
18. Accordingly, the petition is disposed off.
