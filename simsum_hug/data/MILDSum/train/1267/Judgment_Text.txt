4. It is stated in para 38 of the affidavit that out of 23 cases, only 12 are still
pending against the accused-applicant. The close scrutiny of the averments
of para 38 of the affidavit would reveal that though the accused-applicant
has secured acquittal in some of the cases against him but some of the
heinous cases including murder and rape etc., are still pending against him
in the Courts.
5. The background of the present case is that a case was registered against
the accused-applicant being FIR No.548 of 2019 under Sections 376, 420,
406, 506 IPC at Police Station Lanka, District Varanasi on a complaint by
the victim, who later on attempted to commit suicide along with her friend
within the precincts of the Supreme Court India on 16.08.2021. They were
admitted in very serious and critical conditions in Ram Manohar Lohia
Hospital, New Delhi and later on died on 21.08.2021 and 24.08.2021
6. Present accused-applicant is a ‘Bahubali, a criminal turned politician
which is evident from his long criminal history of heinous offences given in
para 38 of the affidavit. The police after investigating the offence filed a
charge-sheet against the accused-applicant in the said FIR No.548 of 2019
(supra).     In   order   toterrorize   and    put   undue    pressure   on    the
victim/prosecutrix, the accused-applicant got several cases registered
against her and her friend/witness so that they would not support the
prosecution case.
7. On 10.11.2020, the victim gave an application to the Senior
Superintendent of Police, Varanasi alleging that co-accused-Amitabh
Thakur, an Ex IPS officer was manufacturing false documents/evidence
against the victim and her friend to favour of present accused-applicant on
monetary consideration. It was alleged that prosecutrix’s dignity, honour
and image were being besmirch and tarnished. The accused and co-accused
were abating and drawing her close to commit suicide. She was being
continuously harassed physically and mentally and subjected to cruelty to
change her stand before the Court. The accused-applicant and his henchman
were employing all kinds of undue pressure on her to change her stand
before the Court and turn hostile. She made allegations against the co-
accused-Amitabh Thakur, who in active connivance with the present
accused-applicant, extended threat to her life. She also said that she would
be compelled to commit suicide because of the accused-applicant and co-
8. The victim and her friend-Satyam Prakash Rai, thereafter, on 16.08.2021
attempted to commit suicide outside the Gate No.6 of the Supreme Court
and went live on Facebook making serious allegations against the accused-
applicant and co-accused-Amitabh Thakur. Statements made by two victims
live on Facebook have been treated as dying declarations.
9. The Director General of Police constituted a Two Members Committee
consisting of Director General, U.P. Police Recruitment and Promotional
Board and Additional Director General, Women and Child Security
Organization, Lucknow. The said Committee submitted its report on
27.08.2021. On the basis of said report, a written complaint was given
by Sub Inspector Daya Shankar Dwivedi at Police Station Hazratganj,
which is the basis of the FIR in question registered against the
accused-applicant and co-accused.
10. Report of the two members team on the basis of which the FIR in
question has been registered would mention that Bharat Singh, father of the
accused-applicant gave an application on 03.03.2020 to S.S.P. Varanasi
requesting him to get further investigation conducted under Section 173(8)
Cr.P.C. in FIR No.548 of 2019 (supra) registered against the accused-
11. Then, Senior Superintendent of police, Varanasi marked           the said
application to the then Circle Officer, Bhelupur, Mr.Amresh Kumar Singh.
Mr.Amresh Kumar Singh prepared a report on the application and in last
paragraph of his report said that the FIR No.548 of 2019 (supra) was falsely
lodged in conspiracy of the prosecutrix, her friend, Satyam Prakash Rai,
Angad Rai and Vijay Shankar Tiwari and recommended for fresh
investigation under Section 173(8) Cr.P.C. The case was pending in the
Court but the Circle Officer, Amresh Kumar Singh made available the said
report to co-accused-Amitabh Thakur and other persons under Right to
Information Act despite the case being pending in the Court. This report
was made public to defame the victim/prosecutrix and tarnish her character
and dignity. It was made public to weaken the case against the accused-
applicant. The Report of C.O. Bhelupur was a preliminary report on the
application for further investigation, and final decision for further
investigation was yet to be taken but the said report was made public in
order to put undue pressure on the prosecutrix and her friend so that they
should not support the prosecution case against the accused-applicant.
12. It is alleged that when the accused-applicant and his goons were
not successful in breaking down/winning the victim and the witness, they
put all kind of pressure and tortured them physically and mentally. Circle
Officer, Bhelupur also assisted the accused-applicant. The victim and her
friend were so much harassed and tortured that they became desperate as
they perceived that they would not get justice. They had fears about their
lives. Their dignity, character and image were being tarnished and
besmirch. Under these circumstances, they went to Supreme Court, highest
seat of justice and attempted suicide outside the Supreme Court gate and
later on they died during the course of treatment. Co-accused-Amitabh
Thakur ex-IPS officer has been granted bail by this court vide order dated
14.03.2022 but the case of the accused-applicant is different from the co-
13. It is unfortunate and the greatest irony of the largest democracy of the
world that as many as 43 percent of the Member of Lok Sabha who got
elected in 2019 general elections are having criminal cases including cases
related to heinous offences pending against them.
14. A constitution Bench of the Supreme Court in the case of Public
Interest Foundation & Ors vs Union of India & Anr : (2019) 3 SCC 224
has taken note of 244th Law Commission report in which it was said
that 30 per cent or 152 sitting M.P.s were having criminal cases
pending against them, of which about half i.e. 76 were having serious
criminal cases. This phenomenon has increased with every general
election. In 2004, 24 per cent of Lok Sabha M.Ps. had criminal cases
pending, which increased to 30 per cent in 2009 elections. In 2014, it went
up to 34 per cent and in 2019 as mentioned above, 43 per cent Members of
Parliament who got elected for Lok Sabha are having criminal cases
pending against them. The Supreme Court has taken judicial notice of
criminalization of politics and imperative needs of electoral reforms. There
have been several instances of persons charged with serious and heinous
offences like murder, rape, kidnapping and dacoity got tickets to contest
election from political parties and even got elected in large number of
15. The Supreme Court has said that this leads to a very undesirous and
embarrassing situation of law breakers becoming law makers and moving
around police protection. The Supreme Court in the said case has
directed the Election Commission of India to take appropriate measures to
curb criminalization in politics but unfortunately collective will of
the Parliament has not moved in the said direction to protect the
Indian Democracy going in the hands of criminals, thugs and law
breakers. If the politicians are law breakers, citizens cannot expect
accountable and transparent governance and the society governed by the
rule of law be an utopian idea. After independence with every election,
role   of    identities  such   as  caste,  community,    ethnicity, gender,
religion etc, has been becoming more and more prominent in giving
tickets to winnable candidates. These identities coupled with money and
muscle power has made entry of criminals in politics easy and every
political party without exception (may be with some difference in degree
and extent)       uses these criminals to win elections. Giving tickets
to candidates with serious criminal charges would break the confidence
and trust of the civil society, law abiding citizens of this country in the
electoral politics and elections.
16. No one can dispute that the present day politics is caught in crime,
identity, patronage, muscle and money network. Nexus between crime and
politics is serious threat to democratic values and governance based on rule
of law. Elections of Parliament and State Legislature and even for local
bodies and panchayats are very expensive affairs. The record would show
that the elected members of Lok Sabha with criminal records are extremely
wealthier candidates. For example, in 2014 Lok Sabha election 16 out of 23
winners having criminal charges in their credit related to murder were
multi-millionaire. After candidates get re-elected, their wealth and income
grows manyfold which is evident from the fact that in 2014, 165 M.Ps. who
got re-elected, their average wealth growth was Rs.7.5 Crores in 5 years.
17. Earlier, ‘Bahubalis’ and other criminals used to provide support to
candidates on various considerations including caste, religion and political
shelter but now criminals themselves are entering into politics and getting
elected as the political parties do not have any inhibition in giving tickets to
candidates with criminal background including those having heinous
offence(s) registered against them. Confirmed criminal history sheeters and
even those who are behind bars are given tickets by different political
parties and surprisingly some of them get elected as well.
18. It is the responsibility of the Parliament to show its collective will to
restrain the criminals from entering into the politics, Parliament or
legislature to save democracy and the country governed on democratic
principles and rule of law.
19. There is responsibility of civil society as well to rise above the
parochial and narrow considerations of caste, community etc and to ensure
that a candidate with criminal background does not get elected.
Criminalization of politics and corruption in public life have become the
biggest threats to idea of India, its democratic polity and world’s largest
democracy. There is an unholy alliance between organized crime, the
politicians and the bureaucrats and this nexus between them have become
pervasive    reality.  This    phenomenon     has   eroded     the  credibility,
effectiveness, and impartiality of the law enforcement agencies and
administration. This has resulted into lack of trust and confidence in
administration and justice delivery system of the country as the accused
such as the present accused-applicant win over the witnesses, influence
investigation and tamper with the evidence by using their money, muscle
and political power. Alarming number of criminals reaching Parliament and
State Assembly is a wake up call for all. Parliament and Election
Commission of India are required to take effective measures to wean away
criminals from politics and break unholy nexus between criminal politicians
and bureaucrats.
20. This unholy nexus and unmindfulness of political establishment is the
result of reaching person like the accused-applicant, a gangster, hardened
criminal and ‘Bahubali’ to the Parliament and becoming a law maker. This
Court, looking at the heinousness of offence, might of the accused,
evidence available on record, impact on society, possibility of accused
tampering with the evidence and influencing/ winning over the witnesses
by using his muscle and money power does not find that there is a ground
to enlarge the accused-applicant on bail at this stage. This bail application is
thus, rejected.
