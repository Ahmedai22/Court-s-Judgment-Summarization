Mat.Appeal Nos.43 & 72 of 2020
Dated this the 4th day of February, 2022
These     appeals    are  between   the   same  parties.  Mat.
Appeal No.43/2020 is filed by the wife challenging the
decree of divorce granted in favour of the respondent-
husband on the ground of cruelty.            Mat.Appeal No.72/2020
was filed by the husband challenging the dismissal of his
petition for permanent custody of the child born in the
wedlock     with    the   respondent-wife.       The   parties   are
hereinafter     referred     with   reference   to   their  marital
2.      The parties are Christians. Their marriage was
solemnized on 30.04.2015. The husband is an Engineer by
profession and the wife is a Dentist holding post-graduate
degree. At the time of marriage,              the wife was a post-
graduate student in Kannur and the appellant was working
as an Assistant Professor in an Engineering College in
Parippally,     Thiruvananthapuram.         We,  after  hearing   the
counsel for the appellant and going through the pleadings
and  evidence      threshold,    are    of   the  opinion   that  the
parties never developed any emotional bond or intimacy.
Perhaps,    the    reason   that    they   were  living   at  distant
places at the time of marriage had hampered developing
such bonding.       The   marital relationship is built over the
period, based on harmonious combination of differences in
taste, outlook, attitude etc. The initial phase of the
marriage lays a strong foundation for the marriage.               The
understanding built during the initial phase would enable
the parties to resolve the differences which they may
encounter in the later stage of the marriage. In some
jurisdictions, incompatibility is a recognized ground for
divorce.     If domestic harmony is not achieved during the
initial phase of the marriage,             it may lead to constant
quarrels and bickering, spoiling the relationship.                The
incompatibility essentially refers to both parties being
unable to reconcile in their approach to the matrimonial
life.    We thought to refer to the above remarks in this
case obviously for the reason that both parties could not
yield to each other in building a relationship and the
marriage failed at the threshold itself.                The husband
realising    the    insurmountable    hurdle   in  moving   forward,
approached the court for divorce on the ground of cruelty.
The ground of cruelty necessarily pinpoints the faults of
the  opposite      party.     Legal   cruelty   is  different   from
actual cruelty.       The popular meaning of cruelty cannot be
ascribed    to   the    statutory   meaning   of  cruelty.     While
deciding this case, we have           outlined at the outset the
incompatibility of the parties for the reason that, if we
omit   to    refer     to   the  incompatibility,     the   judgment
rendered would only prove innocence or fault of either of
the  parties.        By    incompatibility,    we  mean   that  both
parties failed in building the relationship and one alone
cannot be attributed with the imputation of fault.
3.    The pleadings of the husband dominantly refers to
the quarrelsome attitude of the wife.           The husband would
say even a small provocation would vitiate a conducive
atmosphere at the matrimonial home.           The husband states
that his wife does not like his relationship with his
mother   and     sister.      The   constant  and  recurring   and
quarrelsome attitude of the wife has been             projected as
the ground for divorce.           The wife, on the other hand,
denied any sort of misbehaviour from her side.            However,
she admitted that the husband failed to offer care and
emotional    support     when  it   was  required   including  the
period of pregnancy. It is her case that the husband gave
priority to his comfort and needs than the needs of the
wife while she was pregnant and studying the MDS Course.
The objection of the wife pointed to the fact that the
parties never had any cordial relationship and failed to
develop any emotional intimacy.
4.     We are sure that the parties were leading an
incompatible life from the initial phase of the marriage.
We are called upon to decide on cruelty as a ground for
divorce. The Family Court referred to various incidents
including email communications between the parties to hold
that the wife committed matrimonial cruelty.              We perused
the evidence, email communications and oral evidence of
the parties. We cannot completely blame the wife for the
deteriorated relationship.        All that would go to show that
the parties never had a peaceful relationship.             The email
communications      would   show   the  emotional    turbulence  and
stress experienced by the wife.             Ext.A8 series perhaps
would bring more reflection on the character of the wife.
The  wife    obsessively     charted   her   plans   and  course  of
action. She lists out the work and action of a day in
writing.       It   seems   that     she   was   in   the  habit  of
cataloguing the schedules and routines in writing.               The
distraction or variation appears to have disturbed her
thoughts.     She    meticulously     minutiaed    her   actions  in
advance. The husband         produced a bunch of notes prepared
by the wife as Ext.A8 series. We just refer here the note
prepared on 17.9.2017:
5.     The    husband      attributes    this   conduct    as   a
behavioural disorder.          The wife denies the same.       We are
not   able    to    discern     ourselves    to  classify    this   as
behavioural disorder or not.           There are   various types of
personality disorders.            In the absence of any medical
evidence before us, we may not be able to classify this
behaviour as a personality disorder.              But, we are sure
unstable emotions and relationships existed between the
parties as revealed from Exts.A2 to A4 e-mail chatting
reports and Ext.A5 whatsapp message. If one of the spouses
is unable to adjust to such behaviour, that party cannot
be  found     fault    with.       The   obsessive  nature    of   the
character    possessed      by   the  wife   would  have   led   to  a
deteriorating relationship between the parties from the
initial phase of life itself.           Chasing happiness based on
schedules instead of living in the moment, appears to be
the vowed daily life routine adopted by her.             She was not
realistic to the fact that the secret of marital harmony
lies in accepting the life as it unfolds and not becoming
a  stickler     of   the    schedules   or   routines.    Compulsive
obsessiveness is also considered as a disorder.            Though we
are not sure about attributing the appellant as a person
who  suffers      from   such    disorder,    on  going  though  the
evidence, we are certain such attitude and behaviour was
unbearable to the husband. If the conduct and character of
one party causes misery and agony to the other spouse, the
element     of    cruelty      to   the    spouse   would   surface,
justifying grant of divorce. If the parties cannot mend
their ways, the law cannot remain oblivious to those who
suffer     in     that     relationship.      In   any   matrimonial
relationship, spouses may have a different outlook on the
marriage based on faith, perceptions, outlook, attitudes,
social ethos, etc.         Fearing    divorce is repugnant to his
or her notion,        one would refrain from the divorce based
on mutual consent.         The court cannot leave the life of a
spouse to the mercy of the opposite spouse.            Human problem
requires resolution consistent with the notion of justice.
The husband wants to get out of the misery and agony of
the relationship; though, what was portrayed before the
court is the fault of the wife, the husband also failed in
building    the    relationship.      We   made   an   attempt   for
conciliation.      The said attempt failed.     There is no scope
for reviving the dead marriage.          The Apex Court in Naveen
Kohli v. Neelu Kohli [(2006) 4 SCC 558],            opined that if
the parties cannot live together on account of obvious
differences, one of the parties is adamant and callous in
attitude    for    having    divorce  on   mutual    consent,   such
attitude can be treated as the cause of mental cruelty to
other spouses.          The Apex Court in Samar Ghosh v. Jaya
Ghosh [(2007) 4 SCC 511] also considered such act as
cruelty in the following words:
“Where there has been a long period of
continuous separation, it may fairly be concluded
that the matrimonial bond is beyond repair.            The
marriage becomes a fiction though supported by a
legal tie. By refusing to sever that tie the law in
such cases does not serve the sanctity of marriage;
on the contrary, it shows scant regard for the
feelings and emotions of the parties. In such like
situations, it may lead to mental cruelty.”
6.    The   law    on  divorce  recognises   both   fault   and
consent as a cause for separation. When both the parties
are unable to lead a meaningful matrimonial life due to
inherent differences of opinion and one party is willing
for separation and the other party is withholding consent
for  mutual     separation,     that   itself   would   cause   mental
agony and cruelty to the spouse who demands separation.
The  purpose      of   marriage    is   to   hold   matrimonial   ties
lifelong, respecting mutual obligations and rights. The
companionship of spouses creates oneness of the mind                to
walk together. It is through mutual respect and courtship,
the companionship is built and fortified.                 The modern
jurisprudence of irretrievable break down to allow divorce
is premised on the fact that the spouses can never remain
together on account of their differences. If the court is
able to form an opinion that due to incompatibility, the
marriage failed and one of the spouses was withholding
consent for mutual separation, the court can very well
treat   that    conduct     itself   as  cruelty.    If  one  of   the
spouses is refusing to accord divorce on mutual consent
after   having     convinced    of   the   fact   that  the  marriage
failed,     it is nothing but cruelty to spite the other
spouse. No one can force another to continue in a legal
tie  and    relationship      if   the   relationship    deteriorated
beyond   repair.      The   portrayal    of   such   conduct   through
manifest behaviour of the spouse in a manner understood by
a prudent as 'cruelty' is the language of the lawyer for a
cause before the court. This case is also not different.
The   behavioural          disorder     pointed    out   against   the
appellant    in    the   petition    for   divorce   was   essentially
reflection     of   incompatibility      that  existed    between  the
parties.     The husband wants to get out of the struggled
relationship,      on   the   projected     cause   of  cruelty   with
reference       to       the     incidents       of     misbehaviour.
Incompatibility is a factor that can be reckoned while
considering the ground for cruelty, if one of the spouses
withholds     the     consent    of    mutual    separation,    though
incompatibility is not recognised as ground for divorce.
7.     The     parties    are    young.       They   are   living
separately since 2017.         We, in such circumstances, are of
the view that for the reasons stated above, the order of
the Family Court granting divorce has to be sustained.
Mat.Appeal No.72/2020 is against the dismissal of the
custody    petition.        Admittedly,   the  child   is   with  the
mother ever since his birth.             The father also had not
sought   interim     custody    of   child.  The   husband   was  not
enthusiastic to obtain the custody of the child. The child
is only five years old.           The Family Court dismissed the
claim   for    permanent     custody   taking  note   of   the  above
facts.     We find no reason to interfere with the above
order. However, the said dismissal will not stand in the
way  of    the    husband    moving   the   Family   Court   for  any
visitorial rights or contact rights with a fresh petition.
The Mat. Appeals are dismissed.          No costs.
