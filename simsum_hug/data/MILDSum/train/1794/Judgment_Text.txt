Shri I.S. Asthana, Public Prosecutor for the respondent/State.
Case Diary is available.
This tenth application under Section 439 of CrPC has been
filed for grant of bail. Ninth bail application of the applicant was
dismissed as withdrawn by order dated 07.06.2021 passed in M.Cr.C.
The applicant has been arrested on 05.01.2018 in connection
with Crime No.7/2018 registered at Police Station Ron District Bhind
for the offence under Section 8/20 of NDPS Act.
This repeat application has been filed for grant of bail on the
ground of delay along with the complete order-sheets of the Trial
It is submitted by the counsel for the applicant that this Court
by order dated 25.06.2020 passed in M.Cr.C. No.10547/2020 had
awarded the compensation to the applicant on account of non-
appearance of the prosecution witnesses, but the situation has not
improved and still the prosecution witnesses are not appearing.
Heard the learned counsel for the parties.
According to the prosecution case, 520 grams of opium was
seized from the possession of the applicant, whereas 21 kg 570 grams
of ganja was seized from the possession of the accused Ramnaresh
and both of them were travelling in the same nano car. Earlier also
the applicant had moved an application for grant of bail on the
ground of delay in trial, however after condemning the hostile
attitude of the prosecution by not producing the prosecution
witnesses, this Court in M.Cr.C. No. 10547/2020 passed a detailed
order dated 25.06.2020 and held that the prosecution has blatantly
violated the fundamental right of the applicant of speedy trial and,
accordingly, the prosecution was saddled with the liability of
Rs.20,000/- to be paid by way of compensation to the applicant with
liberty to recover the same from the salary of Inspector Rekha Pal
It is not known as to whether the compensation amount of
Rs.20,000/- has been paid to the applicant Jaipal Singh or not and
whether the said compensation amount has been recovered from the
salary of Inspector Rekha Pal and Inspector Ramnaresh Yadav or not
and whether copy of the said order has been placed in the service
book of Inspector Rekha Pal and Inspector Ramnaresh Yadav or not,
therefore, the Superintendent of Police, Bhind is directed to
immediately submit his compliance report to the Principal Registrar
of this Court within a period of two weeks from today.
So far as the question of delay in trial is concerned, the
applicant was awarded the compensation by order dated 25.06.2020
and from the order-sheets of the Trial Court, it appears that thereafter
the case was taken up on 22.07.2020 but the prosecution witnesses
were not present. Even the applicant was not produced. Thereafter,
the case was adjourned to 17.08.2020. However, on 17.08.2020 the
case was adjourned on account of limited Court functioning in the
wake of second wave of Covid-19. On 03.09.2020, 18.09.2020,
06.10.2020, 19.11.2020 and 10.12.2020, the case was adjourned for
the same reason. On 23.12.2020 the application of the applicant for
his transfer to Bhind Jail was allowed. On 13.01.2021 warrant of
arrest was issued against the prosecution witness No. 9. On
06.02.2021 the examination-in-chief and cross-examination of
Ramnaresh (PW-6) was recorded. Thereafter, on 23.02.2021 the
Rekha Pal (PW-7) was examined. On 15.03.2021 summons were
served on Sub-Inspector Vinod Chhawai, but he did not appear and,
accordingly, bailable warrants were issued. On 03.04.2021 summons
issued against the other witnesses were received back as served, but
they did not appear. Similarly bailable warrant of arrest issued
against Vinod was not received back either served or unserved. On
04.08.2021 bailable warrants issued against Sub-Inspector Vinod
Chhawai were received back with an endorsement that he has been
informed through RM as well as on mobile. However, when the AGP
contacted Vinod then he informed that due to heavy rains in Guna
and Shivpuri, the road connection has broken with Gwalior,
therefore, he is unable to appear, accordingly, fresh bailable warrants
of arrest was issued and the case was taken on 24.08.2021.
Since the applicant has not filed the copy of the order-sheet
dated 24.08.2021, therefore, it is not known as to what transpired on
the said date. From the order-sheets of the Trial Court, it is clear that
although the summons were served on Sub-Inspector Vinod Chhawai,
but he deliberately did not appear before the Trial Court on
15.03.2021 and on 03.04.2021, the bailable warrant of arrest was not
returned back either served or unserved. Thus, it is clear that the
prosecution has not taken a lesson from the order dated 25.06.2020
passed in M.Cr.C. No.10547/2020 and they are still working as per
their own pleasure. The prosecution is not interested in early disposal
of the trial and every prosecution witness who is a police personnel is
taking trial for granted, and are not appearing before the Trial Court
without assigning any reason and permission from the Court.
Accordingly, this Court is of the considered opinion that the
State Government is continuously blatantly violating the fundamental
right of the applicant of speedy trial. On earlier occasion,
compensation of Rs.20,000/- was directed to be paid to the applicant
for violation of his fundamental right. It is really unfortunate that the
prosecution is not ready to understand that no one can be kept behind
the bars at the whims and wishes of the prosecution witnesses. If the
prosecution is not in a position to keep its witnesses present, then
they must think it seriously as to whether they should go for
prosecution of the accused or not. Filing of the charge-sheet is not the
end of the duty of the prosecution. It is their duty to ensure that the
witnesses appear before the Trial Court regularly without any default
so that fate of a person can be decided on the basis of evidences.
Under these circumstances, where the prosecution has not
learnt a lesson and is again blatantly violating the fundamental right
of the applicant, accordingly, the State is directed to pay Rs.50,000/-
(Rupees Fifty Thousand) to the applicant for utter violation of the
fundamental right. The PHQ has issued various circulars directing
that   daily    review    regarding   service   of   Summons/Bailable
Warrants/Warrants shall be done by a gazetted officer. But it appears
that all those circulars have been thrown in the dustbin and since the
Superintendent of Police, Bhind has miserably failed in ensuring the
appearance of his own police witnesses before the Trial Court,
therefore, it is directed that the said compensation amount of
Rs.50,000/- shall be recovered from the salary of Superintendent of
Police, Bhind. The State Government is also directed to initiate a
Departmental Enquiry against Vinod Chhawai, Sub-inspector, who
did not appear before the Trial Court on 15.03.2021 in spite of
service of summons. The State Government is also directed to start
Departmental Enquiry against the constable who did not serve the
bailable warrants on Vinod Chhawai and did not returned the same
either served or unserved on 03.04.2021.
Let the compensation amount be paid within a period of 15
days from today and the Departmental Enquiry against Vinod and
other guilty police personnel be initiated within the said period.
The Inspector General of Police, Chambal Range, Gwalior is
directed to submit his compliance report before the Principal
Registrar of this Court on or before 04.10.2021. The Inspector
General of Police is also directed to file an affidavit before the
Principal Registrar of this Court to the effect as to whether the
amount of Rs.50,000/- has been recovered from the salary of
Superintendent of Police, Bhind or not as well as he is also directed
to place the copy of the charge-sheet, which shall be issued to Vinod
Chhawai and other guilty persons who did not appear before the Trial
Court or who did not serve the summons/bailable warrants on the
police witnesses.
Apart from the payment of compensation amount of
Rs.50,000/- to the applicant, it is directed that the Trial shall be
positively concluded within a period of three months from the date of
receipt of certified copy/soft copy of this order.
The Trial Court shall fix the case on day to day basis and it
shall be the personal duty and responsibility of Superintendent of
Police, Bhind to ensure that all the prosecution witnesses appear
before the Trial Court on the date which will be fixed by the Trial
Court. In case, if any witness is unable to appear before the Trial
Court, then the application shall be filed with an affidavit of the
Superintendent of Police, Bhind pointing out the reasons for
exemption from appearance of the witness on the said date.
Office is directed to immediately send a copy of this order to
the Trial Court as well as to the Inspector General of Police, Chambal
Range, Gwalior as well as the Superintendent of Police, Bhind for
necessary information and compliance.
A typed copy of this order be also provided to the Public
Prosecutor so that he can communicate the same to the Inspector
General of Police, Chambal Range, Gwalior as well as the
Superintendent of Police, Bhind without any further delay.
With aforesaid observations, the application is finally disposed
