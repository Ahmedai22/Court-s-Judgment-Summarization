The petitioner is before this Court calling in question the
proceedings in C.C.No.2610 of 2020 pending before the IX
Additional Chief Metropolitan Magistrate, Bangalore, whereby
the learned Magistrate takes cognizance for the offences
punishable under Sections 357, 499 and 500 of the IPC.
2.  Heard   Sri.Madhukar     Deshpande,      learned counsel
appearing for petitioner and Sri.Puttige.R.Ramesh, learned
senior counsel appearing for the respondent.
3. Shorn of unnecessary details, facts in brief germane for
consideration of the subject lis are as follows:-
The respondent/complainant is an officer of the Indian
Police   Service  having   retired    on   attaining   the age  of
superannuation on 31.07.2017.        The petitioner was posted as
Deputy Inspector General (DIG) Prisons in the Department of
Prisons, Government of Karnataka. The petitioner and the
respondent were in the same department and the petitioner was
an officer of a rank below to that of the respondent. On
12.07.2017 the allegation is that the petitioner had made
defamatory statement on the respondent by way of written words
published in the media and had thereby committed offences
punishable under Sections 357, 499 and 500 of the IPC. The
contention of the respondent is that by the said words, the
petitioner had tarnished the image of the respondent by giving
wide publicity of the report which was communicated by the
petitioner to the Head of the Department.     The wide publicity
alleged is for the reason print and visual media carried the said
4. On the basis of the aforesaid report dated 12-07-2017,
the respondent registers a complaint invoking Section 200 of the
Cr.P.C. for offences punishable under Sections 357, 499 and
500 of the IPC for defamation. After recording statements of
witnesses, the petitioner and the respondent, the learned
Magistrate in terms of order dated 22-10-2019 takes cognizance
and directs registration of criminal case against the petitioner
and also issued summons against the accused/petitioner. It is
at that juncture the petitioner has knocked the doors of this
Court in the subject petition.
5. Heard Sri Madhukar Deshpande, learned counsel
appearing for the petitioner and Sri Puttige R.Ramesh, learned
Senior Counsel appearing for the respondent.
6. The learned counsel for the petitioner would urge the
following contentions:
(a)   That since the allegation that is made is performed
during the course of conduct of official duty sanction
under Section 197 of the Cr.P.C. is mandatory.
Admittedly, there is no sanction in the case accorded
to prosecute the petitioner and therefore, the entire
proceedings would stand vitiated.
(b)   The ingredients that are required to drive home
Section 499 of the IPC are totally absent in the case
at hand as the petitioner has communicated to the
Head of the Department in the official capacity and
there is no evidence that the petitioner has
communicated the same to the media both visual
and print. Official communication of true facts or
events cannot mean that they would be defamation of
any officer much less the respondent.
(c)   Section 199 of the Cr.P.C. permits only an aggrieved
person to invoke Section 499 or Section 500 of the
IPC. The complainant cannot be construed to be an
aggrieved person.
In support of his contentions, he would place reliance on the
following judgments:
(i)   RAMNATH GOENKA v. A.R.RAJI – 1981 SCC OnLine
(ii)  P.K. GHOSH AND ANOTHER v. SUKHBIR SHARMA –
(iii) D.DEVARAJA v. OWAIS SABEEN HUSSAIN - (2020) 7
(iv)  RAJESH RANGARAJAN v. CROP CARE FEDERATION
7. On the other hand, the learned senior Counsel
representing the respondent would submit that the petitioner
was, on the date of lodging of the complaint, holding a different
post and, therefore, no sanction is required to prosecute the
petitioner. The incident that has led to the alleged defamation is
not referable to any public work that was discharged by the
petitioner and, therefore, protection under Section 199(2) of the
Cr.P.C.      is   not   available.   He  would   submit   that  the
communication is sent by the petitioner to the head of the
Department as also to both print and visual media and as such,
it is a matter of trial for the petitioner to come out clean in the
proceedings. The learned senior counsel would place reliance
upon the following judgments:
(i)      PARKASH SINGH BADAL AND ANOTHER v. STATE
(ii)     L.NARAYANA SWAMY v. STATE OF KARNATAKA AND
(iii)    AMRIK SINGH v. STATE OF PEPSU – AIR 1955 SC
(iv)     SUBRAMANIAN SWAMY v. MANMOHAN SINGH AND
(v)      URMILA DEVI v. YUDHVIR SINGH – (2013) 15 SCC
(vi)     RAJIB RANJAN AND OTHERS v. R.VIJAYKUMAR –
(vii)    K.K.MISHRA v. STATE OF MADHYA PRADESH AND
8.    I  have  given   my   anxious   consideration  to  the
submissions of the learned counsel appearing for the petitioner
and the learned senior counsel for the respondent and perused
the material on record.     In furtherance whereof, the following
issues fall for my consideration:
(i)   Whether     proceedings    instituted   for   offences
punishable under Sections 499 and 500 of the IPC for
defamation would be rendered illegal for want of sanction
under Section 197 of the Cr.P.C.?
(ii) Whether the alleged communication/report dated
12-07-2017 amounts to defamation within the meaning of
ingredients     of  Section   499    of  the   IPC   against   the
(i)     Whether            proceedings              instituted            for offences
punishable under Sections 499 and 500 of the IPC for
defamation would be rendered illegal for want of sanction
under Section 197 of the Cr.P.C.?
The petitioner and the respondent are feathers of the same
department. Prior to the entry of the petitioner as DIG, Prisons,
the respondent was working as DGP & Inspector General
(Prisons).        The      petitioner          while       working      as       DIG  (Prisons)
conducted a review about functioning of prison on 12.07.2017.
The outcome of review was a communication to the DGP &
Inspector General (Prisons) in the form a report. The report is
about continued irregularities in the Prison. The narration
contains the inspection conducted by the petitioner from time to
time. Since the entire issue revolves around the communication
dated 12-07-2017 the same is quoted herein for the purpose of

The narration brings about some grave aspects of illegalities
happening in the Prison and also suggested corrective measures
that need to be taken. While saying so, it was also noted that
there were some allegations against the respondent that also
needs to be looked into and stringent action be taken against
those who are making such allegations against the respondent.
10. The communication is not sent to any other person, as
could be seen from the communication itself. It is a simple
communication from the petitioner to the respondent who is the
Head of Prisons. It would have been a circumstance altogether
different if the communication had been made to any other
quarter in the Department, Government, print or Visual media.
It transpires that newspapers next day carried the report and
even the visual media. It is after the publication came about, the
respondent retired from service on 31-07-2017 on attaining the
age of superannuation.      On his retirement, he registers the
impugned private complaint against the petitioner alleging that
the act of the petitioner in communicating the report and the
same being published in both print and visual media has
defamed him. The alleged defamatory part of the communication
is what     is highlighted   in the   afore-quoted  report dated
12.07.2017. On the registration of the private complaint,
recording of sworn statement took place and the learned
Magistrate takes cognizance of the offence punishable under
Sections 357, 499 and 500 of the IPC against the petitioner. It is
at that juncture the petitioner has knocked the doors of this
11. It is not, cannot be in dispute that the report
communicated by the petitioner to the respondent was in the
official capacity.  The narration in the report is a blend of
inspection taken up by the petitioner from time to time in the
official capacity. Therefore, the entire act revolves around the
official duties and on the official capacity of the petitioner. If any
act being done by a public servant in the official capacity is to be
alleged to have a colour of crime and criminal law is to be set in
motion, on such allegations sanction for setting such criminal
law in motion in terms of Section 197 is imperative. Sub-section
(1) of Section 197 of the Cr.P.C. reads as follows:
“197. Prosecution of Judges and public
servants.—(1) When any person who is or was a
Judge or Magistrate or a public servant not
removable from his office save by or with the
sanction of the Government is accused of any
offence alleged to have been committed by him
while acting or purporting to act in the discharge
of his official duty, no Court shall take
cognizance of such offence except with the
previous sanction save as otherwise provided in
the Lokpal and Lokayuktas Act, 2013 (1 of
(a) in the case of a person who is employed or, as
the case may be, was at the time of commission of the
alleged offence employed, in connection with the affairs
of the Union, of the Central Government;
(b) in the case of a person who is employed or, as
the case may be, was at the time of commission of the
alleged offence employed, in connection with the affairs
of a State, of the State Government:
Provided that where the alleged offence was
committed by a person referred to in clause (b) during
the period while a Proclamation issued under clause (1)
of article 356 of the Constitution was in force in a State,
clause (b) will apply as if for the expression “State
Government” occurring therein, the expression “Central
Government” were substituted.
Explanation.—For the removal of doubts it is
hereby declared that no sanction shall be required in
case of a public servant accused of any offence alleged
to have been committed under section 166A, section
166B, section 354, section 354A, section 354B, section
354C, section 354D, section 370, section 375, section
376, section 376A, section 376C, section 376D or
section 509 of the Indian Penal Code (45 of 1860).”
(Emphasis supplied)
Section 197 of the Cr.P.C. which deals with prosecution of
public servants mandates that no Court shall take cognizance of
the offence except with the previous sanction of the Competent
12. It is an admitted fact that the Court has taken
cognizance of the offence against the petitioner for offences
punishable under Sections 357, 499 and 500 of the IPC.
Without doubt, they are offences punishable under the Code and
the Court could not have taken cognizance without an order of
sanction from the hands of the Competent Authority being
placed before the Court. There could have been no question of
further proceedings being taken up without an order of sanction.
Several Constitutional Courts have, while considering a case
that is instituted for the offence punishable under Section 499
or 500 of the IPC which deals with defamation have so
interpreted that sanction under Section 197 of the Cr.P.C. is
imperative.       If the kernel of the article or letter alleging
defamation is seen, as quoted (supra), it would demonstrate
reasonable connection to the discharge of official duty of the
petitioner.    The High Court of Madras in the case of RAMNATH
GOENKA V. A.R. RAJI1 has held as follows:
“10. He also relies on the extracts incorporated in
the above decision from Hori Ram Singh's case reported
in AIR 1939 FC 43 : ((1939) 40 Cri LJ 468) and AIR
1948 PC 128 : ((1948) 49 Cri LJ 503). He also referred
to me a decision of our High Court by Maheswaran, J.
reported in Ramachandran In re, 1979 Mad LW (Cri)
180 : (1980 Cri LJ 349). The learned Judge, after
referring to a number of cases under S. 197 Cri. P.C.
has observed at page 184 (of Mad LW) (Cri): (at p. 353
“I must point out that the act
entitled to the protection of S. 197 Cri.
11. There is a plethora of decisions on the
application of S. 197 Cri. P.C. but ultimately the test to
be applied, whether the sanction is needed or not,
depend on circumstances of each case. The learned
counsel for the respondent brings to my notice the
official functions and duties of the Principal Information
Officer, press Conference Bureau, Government of
“Advising    Government       on     the
ministries. Disseminating information on the
policies and activities of the Government;
Maintaining liaison with press; the reporting
to    Government     public    policies    and
performance as reflected in the press.”
12. Thus it is seen that the handing over of
the hand outs for publication is undoubtedly
characteristic of the official duty of the
respondent, I have no doubt that the acts
complained of are so interrelated with the official
duty of the Principal Information Officer, so as to
attract the protection afforded by S. 197 Cri. P.C.
The acts are so integrally connected with the duty
attached to the officer it is not possible to
separate them. At any rate, there is a reasonable
connection between the act alleged by the
respondent and his official duty. What has been
alleged against him is certainly something to do
with his official duty. Under these circumstances,
opposing the principles laid down in the decisions
referred above, I feel the order passed by the
learned Chief Metropolitan Magistrate is correct.
The revision fails and it is dismissed.”
(Emphasis supplied)
The High Court of Delhi in the case of P.K. GHOSH &
ANOTHER V. SUKHBIR SHARMA2, has held as follows:
“5. That part, the said letter contains certain
comments regarding the complaint made by the
respondent against the Commissioner (Personnel) of the
D.D.A. It does not contain any defamatory word against
the respondent. That being so, there was absolutely no
justification for taking cognizance of the offence under
Section 500, IPC against petitioner No. 1.
6. It is undisputed that the petitioner No. 1
is the Vice-Chairman of the D.D.A. D.D.A. is an
authority created under the statute by the
Government and such an authority is an affair of
the State and the Officer appointed as the Vice-
Chairman of the D.D.A. is definitely a public
servant employed in connection with the affairs of
the State within the meaning of Section 197, Cr.
P.C. Consequently, prosecution of the petitioner
No. 1 is also bad for want of sanction under
7. So far as the petitioner No. 2 is concerned,
there is nothing on record to make out any case against
him. Admittedly, he is not he author of the letter in
question. He had neither made nor published any
defamatory statement against the respondent. It has to
be borne in mind that setting criminal law in motion is
fraught with serious consequences. Before issuing a
process against the accused, the Magistrate should
satisfy himself that the allegations made in the
complaint on its face values and the sworn statements
coupled with the documents filed prima facie reveal the
commission of any offence against him. In the instant
case, the impugned order does not reflect that the
learned Magistrate has applied his mind to the facts of
the case and the law applicable thereto. On the other
hand, I am constrained to observe that the learned
Magistrate has acted in a mechanical manner in taking
cognizance of the offence against the petitioners. In this
context, I may usefully excerpt the following
observations of Their Lordships of the Supreme Court in
M/s. Pepsi Food Ltd. v. Special Judicial Magistrate, AIR
criminal case is a serious matter. Criminal
law cannot be set into motion as a matter of
course. It is not that the complaint has to
bring only two witnesses to support his
allegations in the complaint to have the
criminal law set into motion. The order of the
Magistrate summoning the accused must
reflect that he has applied his mind to the
facts of the case and the law applicable
allegations made in the complaint and the
evidence both oral and documentary in
support thereof and would that be sufficient
for the complainant to succeed in bringing
charge home to the accused. It is not that the
Magistrate is a silent spectator at the time of
recording of preliminary evidence before
summoning of the accused. Magistrate has to
carefully scrutinise the evidence brought on
record and may even himself put questions
to the complainant and his witnesses to elicit
answers to find out the truthfulness of the
allegations or otherwise and then examine if
any offence is prima facie committed by all or
any of the accused.”
For the foregoing reasons, the petition is allowed
and the impugned order dated 3.3.1999 is set aside
and the proceedings emanating from the complaint filed
by the respondent and pending on the file of the
Metropolitan Magistrate, Delhi are quashed.”

In the light of the afore-quoted judgments of both the High Court
of Madras and High Court of Delhi, interpreting the interplay
between Section 499 and 500 of the IPC and Section 197 of the
Cr.P.C. it becomes unmistakably clear that sanction under
Section 197 of the Cr.P.C. would be imperative, if the alleged
defamatory statements are in the course of discharge of official
13. The aforesaid interpretation is further amplified by the
Apex Court in the case of D.DEVARAJA3 (supra), wherein the
Apex Court has interpreted sanction under Section 197 of the
Cr.P.C. to be imperative, if the allegation that drives a case to
the concerned criminal Court is in discharge of official duty or
has a reasonable connection to it. The Apex Court has held as
“30. The object of sanction for prosecution,
whether under Section 197 of the Code of Criminal
Procedure, or under Section 170 of the Karnataka
Police Act, is to protect a public servant/police officer
discharging official duties and functions from
harassment by initiation of frivolous retaliatory
criminal proceedings. As held by a Constitution Bench
of this Court in Matajog Dobey v. H.C. Bhari: (AIR p. 48,
“15. … Public servants have to be protected from
harassment in the discharge of official duties while
ordinary citizens not so engaged do not require this
There is no question of any discrimination
between one person and another in the matter of taking
proceedings against a public servant for an act done or
purporting to be done by the public servant in the
discharge of his official duties. No one can take such
proceedings without such sanction.”
31. In Pukhraj v. Stateof  Rajasthan this    Court    held:
“2. … While the law is well settled the difficulty really
arises in applying the law to the facts of any particular case.
The intention behind the section is to prevent public servants
from being unnecessarily harassed. The section is not
restricted only to cases of anything purported to be done in
good faith, for a person who ostensibly acts in execution of his
duty still purports so to act, although he may have a
dishonest intention. Nor is it confined to cases where the act,
which constitutes the offence, is the official duty of the official
concerned. Such an interpretation would involve a
contradiction in terms, because an offence can never be an
official duty. The offence should have been committed when
an act is done in the execution of duty or when an act
purports to be done in execution of duty. The test appears to
be not that the offence is capable of being committed only by a
public servant and not by anyone else, but that it is committed
by a public servant in an act done or purporting to be done in
the execution of duty. The section cannot be confined to only
such acts as are done by a public servant directly in
pursuance of his public office, though in excess of the duty or
under a mistaken belief as to the existence of such duty. Nor
need the act constituting the offence be so inseparably
connected with the official duty as to form part and parcel of
the same transaction. What is necessary is that the offence
must be in respect of an act done or purported to be done in
the discharge of an official duty. It does not apply to acts done
purely in a private capacity by a public servant. Expressions
such as the “capacity in which the act is performed”, “cloak of
office” and “professed exercise of the office” may not always
be appropriate to describe or delimit the scope of section. An
act merely because it was done negligently does not cease to
be one done or purporting to be done in execution of a duty.”
32. In Amrik Singh v. State of PEPSU this Court referred
to the judgments of the Federal Court in Hori Ram
Singh v. Crown; H.H.B. Gill v. King Emperor and the judgment
of the Privy Council in Gill v. R. and held: (Amrik Singh
case AIR p. 312, para 8)
“8. The result of the authorities may thus be
summed up : It is not every offence committed by a
public servant that requires sanction for prosecution
under Section 197(1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure;
nor even every act done by him while he is actually
engaged in the performance of his official duties; but if
the act complained of is directly concerned with his
official duties so that, if questioned, it could be claimed
to have been done by virtue of the office, then sanction
would be necessary; and that would be so, irrespective
of whether it was, in fact, a proper discharge of his
duties, because that would really be a matter of defence
on the merits, which would have to be investigated at
the trial, and could not arise at the stage of the grant
of sanction, which must precede the institution of the
33. Section 197 of the Code of Criminal Procedure,
1898, hereinafter referred to as the old Criminal Procedure
Code,      which      fell   for    consideration     in Matajog
Dobey, Pukhraj and Amrik Singh is in pari materia with
Section 197 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973. The
Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 has repealed and replaced
the old Code of Criminal Procedure.
34. In Ganesh Chandra Jew this Court held: (SCC pp.
“7. The protection given under Section 197 is to
protect responsible public servants against the
institution of possibly vexatious criminal proceedings
for offences alleged to have been committed by them
while they are acting or purporting to act as public
servants. The policy of the legislature is to afford adequate
protection to public servants to ensure that they are not
prosecuted for anything done by them in the discharge of their
official duties without reasonable cause, and if sanction is
granted, to confer on the Government, if they choose to
exercise it, complete control of the prosecution. This protection
has certain limits and is available only when the alleged act
done by the public servant is reasonably connected with the
discharge of his official duty and is not merely a cloak for
doing the objectionable act. If in doing his official duty, he
acted in excess of his duty, but there is a reasonable
connection between the act and the performance of the official
duty, the excess will not be a sufficient ground to deprive the
public servant of the protection. The question is not as to the
nature of the offence such as whether the alleged offence
contained an element necessarily dependent upon the
offender being a public servant, but whether it was committed
by a public servant acting or purporting to act as such in the
discharge of his official capacity. Before Section 197 can be
invoked, it must be shown that the official concerned was
accused of an offence alleged to have been committed by him
while acting or purporting to act in the discharge of his official
duties. It is not the duty which requires examination so much
as the act, because the official act can be performed both in
the discharge of the official duty as well as in dereliction of it.
The act must fall within the scope and range of the official
duties of the public servant concerned. It is the quality of the
act which is important and the protection of this section is
available if the act falls within the scope and range of his
official duty.”
35. In State of Orissa v. Ganesh Chandra Jew this
Court interpreted the use of the expression “official
duty” to imply that the act or omission must have been
done by the public servant in course of his service and
that it should have been in discharge of his duty.
Section 197 of the Code of Criminal Procedure does not
extend its protective cover to every act or omission done
by a public servant while in service. The scope of
operation of the section is restricted to only those acts
or omissions which are done by a public servant in
discharge of official duty.
36. In Shreekantiah Ramayya Munipalli v. State of
Bombay this Court explained the scope and object of Section
197 of the old Criminal Procedure Code, which as stated
hereinabove, is in pari materia with Section 197 of the Code of
Criminal Procedure. This Court held: (AIR pp. 292-93, paras
“18. Now it is obvious that if Section 197 of the Code of
Criminal Procedure is construed too narrowly it can never be
applied, for of course it is no part of an official's duty to
commit an offence and never can be. But it is not the duty we
have to examine so much as the act, because an official act
can be performed in the discharge of official duty as well as in
dereliction of it. The section has content and its language must
be given meaning. What it says is—
‘When any public servant … is accused of any “offence”
alleged to have been committed by him while acting or
purporting to act in the discharge of his official duty….’
We have therefore first to concentrate on the word
19. Now an offence seldom consists of a single act. It is
usually composed of several elements and, as a rule, a whole
series of acts must be proved before it can be established. In
the present case, the elements alleged against Accused 2 are,
first, that there was an “entrustment” and/or “dominion”;
second, that the entrustment and/or dominion was “in his
capacity as a public servant”; third, that there was a
“disposal”; and fourth, that the disposal was “dishonest”.
Now it is evident that the entrustment and/or dominion here
were in an official capacity, and it is equally evident that there
could in this case be no disposal, lawful or otherwise, save by
an act done or purporting to be done in an official capacity.
Therefore, the act complained of, namely, the disposal,
could not have been done in any other way. If it was innocent,
it was an official act; if dishonest, it was the dishonest doing
of an official act, but in either event the act was official
because Accused 2 could not dispose of the goods save by the
doing of an official act, namely, officially permitting their
disposal; and that he did. He actually permitted their release
and purported to do it in an official capacity, and apart from
the fact that he did not pretend to act privately, there was no
other way in which he could have done it. Therefore, whatever
the intention or motive behind the act may have been, the
physical part of it remained unaltered, so if it was official in
the one case it was equally official in the other, and the only
difference would lie in the intention with which it was done: in
the one event, it would be done in the discharge of an official
duty and in the other, in the purported discharge of it.”
37. The scope of Section 197 of the old Code of Criminal
Procedure, was also considered in P. Arulswami v. State of
Madras [P. Arulswami v. State of Madras, AIR 1967 SC 776 :
1967 Cri LJ 665] where this Court held : (AIR p. 778, para 6)
“6. … It is the quality of the act that is important
and if it falls within the scope and range of his official
duties the protection contemplated by Section 197 of
the Criminal Procedure Code will be attracted.”
“If the act is totally unconnected with the official
duty, there can be no protection. It is only when it is
either within the scope of the official duty or in excess
of it that the protection is claimable….”
38. In B. Saha v. M.S. Kochar this Court held : (SCC p.
“18. In sum, the sine qua non for the applicability of this
section is that the offence charged, be it one of commission or
omission, must be one which has been committed by the
public servant either in his official capacity or under colour of
the office held by him.”
39. In Virupaxappa Veerappa Kadampur v. State of
Mysore cited by Mr Poovayya, a three-Judge Bench of this
Court had, in the context of Section 161 of the Bombay Police
Act, 1951, which is similar to Section 170 of the Karnataka
Police Act, interpreted the phrase “under colour of duty” to
mean “acts done under the cloak of duty, even though not by
virtue of the duty”.
40. In Virupaxappa Veerappa Kadampur this Court
referred (at AIR p. 851, para 9) to the meaning of the words
“colour of office” in Wharton's Law Lexicon, 14th Edn., which
“Colour of office, when an act is unjustly done by the
countenance of an office, being grounded upon corruption, to
which the office is as a shadow and colour.”
41. This Court also referred (at AIR p. 852, para 9) to
the meaning of “colour of office” in Stroud's Judicial
Dictionary, 3rd Edn., set out hereinbelow:
“Colour:“Colour of office” is always taken in the worst
part, and signifies an act evil done by the countenance of an
office, and it bears a dissembling face of the right of the office,
whereas the office, is but a veil to the falsehood, and the thing
is grounded upon vice, and the office is as a shadow to it. But
“by reason of the office” and “by virtue of the office” are taken
always in the best part.”
42. After referring to the Law Lexicons referred to
above, this Court held: (Virupaxappa Veerappa Kadampur
case AIR p. 852, para 10)
“10. It appears to us that the words “under colour of
duty” have been used in Section 161(1) to include acts done
under the cloak of duty, even though not by virtue of the duty.
When he (the police officer) prepares a false panchnama or a
false report he is clearly using the existence of his legal duty
as a cloak for his corrupt action or to use the words
in Stroud's Dictionary “as a veil to his falsehood”. The acts
thus done in dereliction of his duty must be held to have been
done “under colour of the duty”.”
43. In Om Prakash v. State of Jharkhand this Court,
after referring to various decisions, pertaining to the police
excess, explained the scope of protection under Section 197 of
the Code of Criminal Procedure as follows: (SCC p. 89, para
“32. The true test as to whether a public servant was
acting or purporting to act in discharge of his duties would be
whether the act complained of was directly connected with his
official duties or it was done in the discharge of his official
duties or it was so integrally connected with or attached to his
office as to be inseparable from it (K. Satwant Singh [K.
Satwant Singh v. State of Punjab, AIR 1960 SC 266: 1960 Cri
LJ 410]). The protection given under Section 197 of the Code
has certain limits and is available only when the alleged act
done by the public servant is reasonably connected with the
discharge of his official duty and is not merely a cloak for
doing the objectionable act. If in doing his official duty, he
acted in excess of his duty, but there is a reasonable
connection between the act and the performance of the official
duty, the excess will not be a sufficient ground to deprive the
public servant of the protection (Ganesh Chandra Jew [State
of Orissa v. Ganesh Chandra Jew, (2004) 8 SCC 40 : 2004
SCC (Cri) 2104] ). If the above tests are applied to the facts of
the present case, the police must get protection given under
Section 197 of the Code because the acts complained of are so
integrally connected with or attached to their office as to be
inseparable from it. It is not possible for us to come to a
conclusion that the protection granted under Section 197 of
the Code is used by the police personnel in this case as a
cloak for killing the deceased in cold blood.”

44. In Sankaran Moitra v. Sadhna Das the majority
referred       to Gill v. R , H.H.B.     Gill v. King    Emperor;
Shreekantiah Ramayya Munipalli v. State of Bombay; Amrik
Singh v. State      of PEPSU ; Matajog    Dobey v. H.C.    Bhari ;
Pukhraj v. State          of      Rajasthan ; B.      Saha v. M.S.
Kochar ; Bakhshish Singh Brar v. Gurmej Kaur ; Rizwan
Ahmed Javed Shaikh v. Jammal Patel and held: (Sankaran
Moitra case [Sankaran Moitra v. Sadhna Das, (2006) 4 SCC
584 : (2006) 2 SCC (Cri) 358] , SCC pp. 602-603, para 25)
“25. The High Court has stated that killing of a person
by use of excessive force could never be performance of duty.
It may be correct so far as it goes. But the question is whether
that act was done in the performance of duty or in purported
performance of duty. If it was done in performance of duty or
purported performance of duty, Section 197(1) of the Code
cannot be bypassed by reasoning that killing a man could
never be done in an official capacity and consequently Section
197(1) of the Code could not be attracted. Such a reasoning
would be against the ratio of the decisions of this Court
referred to earlier. The other reason given by the High Court
that if the High Court were to interfere on the ground of want
of sanction, people will lose faith in the judicial process,
cannot also be a ground to dispense with a statutory
requirement or protection. Public trust in the institution can be
maintained by entertaining causes coming within its
jurisdiction, by performing the duties entrusted to it diligently,
in accordance with law and the established procedure and
without delay. Dispensing with of jurisdictional or statutory
requirements which may ultimately affect the adjudication
itself, will itself result in people losing faith in the system. So,
the reason in that behalf given by the High Court cannot be
sufficient to enable it to get over the jurisdictional requirement
of a sanction under Section 197(1) of the Code of Criminal
Procedure. We are therefore satisfied that the High Court was
in error in holding that sanction under Section 197(1) was not
needed in this case. We hold that such sanction was
necessary and for want of sanction the prosecution must be
quashed at this stage. It is not for us now to answer the
submission of the learned counsel for the complainant that
this is an eminently fit case for grant of such sanction.”
45. The dissenting view of C.K. Thakker, J. in Sankaran
Moitra supports the contention of Mr Luthra to some extent.
However, we are bound by the majority view. Furthermore
even the dissenting view of C.K. Thakker, J. was in the
context of an extreme case of causing death by assaulting the
46. In K.K. Patel v. State of Gujarat [K.K. Patel v. State
of Gujarat, this Court referred to Virupaxappa Veerappa
Kadampur and held: (K.K. Patel case SCC p. 203, para 17)
“17. The indispensable ingredient of the said offence is
that the offender should have done the act “being a public
servant”. The next ingredient close to its heels is that such
public servant has acted in disobedience of any legal direction
concerning the way in which he should have conducted as
such public servant. For the offences under Sections 167 and
219 IPC the pivotal ingredient is the same as for the offence
under Section 166 IPC. The remaining offences alleged in the
complaint, in the light of the averments made therein, are
ancillary offences to the above and all the offences are parts
of the same transaction. They could not have been committed
without there being at least the colour of the office or authority
which the appellants held.”
47. Mr Poovayya argued that the complaint filed by the
respondent against the appellant-accused was in gross abuse
of process, frivolous and mala fide. Controverting the
allegation of the respondent in his complaint, of police
excesses while the respondent was in police custody between
27-2-2013 and 14-3-2013 in connection with Crime No.
12/2012, Mr Poovayya referred to the order of the learned
Chief Metropolitan Magistrate dated 28-2-2013 in the said
crime case, observing that the respondent had not complained
of any ill-treatment by the police.
48. Mr Poovayya submitted that the learned Chief
Metropolitan Magistrate had, in any case, passed an order for
medical examination of the respondent in view of his
complaint of ill-treatment, but the medical reports, upon such
examination, showed that there was no injury on the
respondent. Mr Poovayya argued that the appellant-accused
had been arrayed as the accused vindictively, out of
vengeance, since the appellant-accused had, in his capacity
as Deputy Commissioner of Police (Central Crime Branch),
submitted an affidavit in the habeas corpus petition filed by
the respondent's father in the Karnataka High Court. The said
affidavit led to the dismissal of the habeas corpus petition.
49. Citing the judgment of this Court in State of
Haryana v. Bhajan Lal [State of Haryana v. Bhajan Lal,
Poovayya argued that where a criminal proceeding is
manifestly prompted by mala fides and instituted with
the ulterior motive of vengeance due to private or
personal grudge, power under Section 482 of the
Criminal Procedure Code ought to be exercised to
prevent abuse of the process of court and/or to secure
the ends of justice.
50. In State of Orissa v. Ganesh Chandra Jew cited by
Mr Poovayya, this Court had, in similar circumstances,
referred to and followed Bhajan Lal and held: (Ganesh
Chandra Jew case SCC pp. 51-52, para 20)
“20. … The factual scenario as indicated above goes to
show that on 28-2-1991 the respondent was produced before
the Magistrate. He was specifically asked as to whether there
was any ill-treatment. Learned SDJM specifically records that
no complaint of any ill-treatment was made. This itself strikes
at the credibility of the complaint. … Though there are several
other aspects highlighted in the version indicated in the
complaint and the materials on record are there, we do not
think it necessary to go into them because of the inherent
improbabilities of the complainant's case and the patent mala
fides involved.”
51. In K.K. Patel v. State of Gujarat this Court held:
(SCC p. 201, paras 11-12)
“11. That apart, the view of the learned Single Judge of
the High Court that no revision was maintainable on account
of the bar contained in Section 397(2) of the Code, is clearly
erroneous. It is now well-nigh settled that in deciding whether
an order challenged is interlocutory or not as for Section
397(2) of the Code, the sole test is not whether such order was
passed during the interim stage (vide Amar Nath v. State of
Haryana, Madhu Limaye v. State of Maharashtra , V.C.
Shukla v. State and Rajendra Kumar Sitaram Pande v.
Uttam. The feasible test is whether by upholding the
objections raised by a party, it would result in culminating the
proceedings, if so any order passed on such objections would
not be merely interlocutory in nature as envisaged in Section
397(2) of the Code. In the present case, if the objection raised
by the appellants were upheld by the Court the entire
prosecution proceedings would have been terminated. Hence,
as per the said standard, the order was revisable.
12. Therefore, the High Court went wrong in holding
that the order impugned before the Sessions Court was not
revisable in view of the bar contained in Section 397(2) of the
52. In D.T. Virupakshappa v. C. Subash, cited by Mr
Poovayya, the question raised by the appellant before this
Court was, whether the learned Magistrate could not have
taken cognizance of the alleged offence which was of police
excess in connection with the investigation of the criminal
case, without sanction from the State Government under
Section 197 of the Code of Criminal Procedure and whether
the High Court should have quashed the proceedings on that
ground alone.
53. This Court in Virupakshappa case held that the
whole allegation of police excess in connection with the
investigation of the criminal case, was reasonably connected
with the performance of the official duty of the appellant. The
learned Magistrate could not have, therefore, taken
cognizance of the case, without previous sanction of the State
Government. This Court found that the High Court had missed
this crucial point in passing the impugned order, dismissing
the application of the policeman concerned under Section 482
of the Code of Criminal Procedure.
54. In Ganesh Chandra Jew, the Magistrate had, as in
this case, specially recorded that there was no complaint of
any ill-treatment. This Court was of the view that continuance
of the proceeding would amount to the abuse of the process of
law. Accordingly, this Court set aside the judgment of the
High Court whereby the High Court refused to exercise its
power under Section 482 of the Criminal Procedure Code to
quash an order of sub-Divisional Judicial Magistrate, in a
complaint against police officials, without sanction under
Section 197 of the Criminal Procedure Code.
55. Devinder Singh v. State of Punjab cited by Mr
Luthra is clearly distinguishable as that was a case of killing
by     the    police   in    fake   encounter. Satyavir    Singh
Rathi v. State also pertains to a fake encounter, where the
deceased was mistakenly identified as a hardcore criminal
and shot down without provocation. The version of the police
that the police had been attacked first and had retaliated,
was found to be false. In the light of these facts, that this
Court held that it could not, by any stretch of imagination, be
claimed by anybody that a case of murder could be within the
expression “colour of duty”. This Court dismissed the appeals
of the policemen concerned against conviction, inter alia,
under Section 302 of the Penal Code, which had duly been
confirmed by the High Court. The judgment is clearly
56. The judgment of this Court in State of A.P. v. N.
Venugopal is distinguishable in that the policemen concerned,
being the Sub-Inspector, Head Constable and a Constable
attached to a police station had without warrant, illegally
detained the complainant for interrogation under Section 161
of the Criminal Procedure Code in connection with a private
complaint of house break and theft, assaulted him along with
the private complainant to extract statements and left him in
an injured condition.
57. In the context of the aforesaid, this Court held that
an act is not “under” a provision of law merely because the
point of time at which it is done coincides with the point of
time when some act in the exercise of the powers granted by
the provision or in performance of the duty imposed by it. To
be able to say that an act is done “under” a provision of law,
one must discover the existence of a reasonable relationship
between the provisions and the act. In the absence of such a
relation, the act cannot be said to be done under the particular
provision of law. It cannot be said that beating a person
suspected of a crime or confining him or sending him away in
an injured condition, at a time when the police were engaged
in investigation, were acts done or intended to be done under
the provisions of the Madras District Police Act or the Criminal
Procedure Code or any other law conferring powers on the
police. It could not be said that the provisions of Section 161 of
the Criminal Procedure Code authorised the police officer
examining a person to beat him or to confine him for the
purpose of inducing him to make a particular statement.
58. In Bhanuprasad      Hariprasad     Dave v. State    of
Gujarat the Head Constable concerned was accused of
preparing a false report with the dishonest intention of saving
a person from whom ganja had been seized, after obtaining
illegal gratification. The Court held that demand and/or
acceptance of illegal gratification could not be said to be an
act done under colour of duty. Significantly, the policemen
concerned had been tried and convicted and their conviction
was affirmed by the High Court. The Head Constable
concerned was seeking bail in this Court.
59. The judgment in State of Maharashtra v. Atma Ram,
was rendered in an appeal from a judgment and order of the
High Court, whereby the High Court had reversed the
conviction of the policemen concerned under Sections 330,
342, 343 and 348 of the Penal Code, holding the prosecution
to be barred under Section 161(1) of the Bombay Police Act.
Allowing the appeal of the State, this Court held that Section
64(b) which confers duty on every police officer to obtain
intelligence concerning the commission of cognizable offences
or designs to commit such offences and to take such other
steps to bring offenders to justice or to prevent the commission
of cognizable and non-cognizable offences, did not authorise
any police officer to beat persons in the course of examination
for the purpose of inducing them to make any particular
statement or to detain such persons. The acts complained of
were factually found not to have been done under colour of
any duty or authority. The order of the High Court acquitting
the policemen concerned was thus, set aside.
60. In Bakhshish Singh Brar v. Gurmej Kaur, the
question raised before this Court was, whether while carrying
out investigation in performance of duty as a policeman, it
was necessary for the policeman concerned to conduct
investigation in such a manner as would result in injury and
death. This Court held that trial of a police officer, accused of
accused of causing grievous injury and death in conducting
raid and search, need not be stayed for want of sanction for
prosecution of the police officer, at the preliminary stage,
observing that criminal trial should not be stayed at the
preliminary stage in every case, as it might cause damage to
the evidence. The Court observed that if necessary, the
question of sanction might be agitated at a later stage.
61. In Om Prakash v. State of Jharkhand this Court
held: (SCC pp. 90-91 & 95, paras 34 & 42-43)
“34. In Matajog Dobey the Constitution Bench of this
Court was considering what is the scope and meaning of a
somewhat similar expression ‘any offence alleged to have
been committed by him while acting or purporting to act in the
discharge of his official duty’ occurring in Section 197 of the
Criminal Procedure Code (5 of 1898). The Constitution Bench
observed that no question of sanction can arise under Section
197 unless the act complained of is an offence; the only point
to determine is whether it was committed in the discharge of
official duty. On the question as to which act falls within the
ambit of abovequoted expression, the Constitution Bench
concluded that there must be a reasonable connection
between the act and the discharge of official duty; the act
must bear such relation to the duty that the accused could lay
a reasonable, but not a pretended or fanciful claim that he did
it in the course of performance of his duty. While dealing with
the question whether the need for sanction has to be
considered as soon as the complaint is lodged and on the
allegations contained therein, the Constitution Bench referred
to Hori Ram Singh and observed that at first sight, it seems as
though there is some support for this view in Hori Ram
Singh because Sulaiman, J. has observed in the said
judgment that as the prohibition is against the institution
itself, its applicability must be judged in the first instance at
the earliest stage of institution and Varadachariar, J. has also
stated that : (Matajog Dobey case AIR p. 49, para 20)
‘20. … the question must be determined with reference
to the nature of the allegations made against the public
servant in the criminal proceedings.’
The legal position is thus settled by the Constitution
Bench in the above paragraph. Whether sanction is necessary
or not may have to be determined from stage to stage. If, at
the outset, the defence establishes that the act purported to be
done is in execution of official duty, the complaint will have to
be dismissed on that ground.
42. It is not the duty of the police officers to kill the
accused merely because he is a dreaded criminal.
Undoubtedly, the police have to arrest the accused and put
them up for trial. This Court has repeatedly admonished
trigger-happy police personnel, who liquidate criminals and
project the incident as an encounter. Such killings must be
deprecated. They are not recognised as legal by our criminal
justice administration system. They amount to State-
sponsored terrorism. But, one cannot be oblivious of the fact
that there are cases where the police, who are performing
their duty, are attacked and killed. There is a rise in such
incidents and judicial notice must be taken of this fact. In such
circumstances, while the police have to do their legal duty of
arresting the criminals, they have also to protect themselves.
The requirement of sanction to prosecute affords protection to
the policemen, who are sometimes required to take drastic
action against criminals to protect life and property of the
people and to protect themselves against attack. Unless
unimpeachable evidence is on record to establish that their
action is indefensible, mala fide and vindictive, they cannot be
subjected to prosecution. Sanction must be a precondition to
their prosecution. It affords necessary protection to such police
personnel. The plea regarding sanction can be raised at the
43. In our considered opinion, in view of the facts which
we have discussed hereinabove, no inference can be drawn in
this case that the police action is indefensible or vindictive or
that the police were not acting in discharge of their official
duty. In Zandu Pharmaceutical Works Ltd. this Court has held
that the power under Section 482 of the Code should be used
sparingly and with circumspection to prevent abuse of process
of court but not to stifle legitimate prosecution. There can be no
two opinions on this, but, if it appears to the trained judicial
mind that continuation of a prosecution would lead to abuse of
process of court, the power under Section 482 of the Code
must be exercised and proceedings must be quashed. Indeed,
the instant case is one of such cases where the proceedings
initiated against the police personnel need to be quashed.”
62. In Pukhraj v. State      of   Rajasthan the    accused
Postmaster General, Rajasthan had allegedly kicked and
abused a union leader who had come to him when he was on
tour, to submit a representation. This Court held that Section
197 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, which is intended to
prevent a public servant from being harassed does not apply
to acts done by a public servant in his private capacity. This
Court, however, left it open to the accused public servant to
place materials on record during the trial to show that the acts
complained of were so interrelated with his official duty as to
attract the protection of Section 197 of the Criminal Procedure
63. In Rizwan Ahmed Javed Shaikh v. Jammal Patel,
this Court held that where the gravamen of the charge was
failure on the part of the accused policemen to produce the
complainants, who were in their custody, before the Judicial
Magistrate, the offence alleged was in their official capacity,
though it might have ceased to be legal at a given point of
time, and the accused police officers would be entitled to the
benefit of Section 197(2) of the Criminal Procedure Code.
64. The judgment in B. Saha v. M.S. Kochar was
rendered in the context of allegations against the Customs
Authorities of misappropriation or conversion of goods. This
Court held that while the seizure of goods by the custom
officers concerned was an act committed in discharge of
official duty, the subsequent acts of misappropriation or
conversion of the goods could not be said to be viewed as
under the colour of official duty. Accordingly, this Court held
that sanction for prosecution was not necessary.
65. The law relating to the requirement of
sanction to entertain and/or take cognizance of an
offence, allegedly committed by a police officer under
Section 197 of the Code of Criminal Procedure read
with Section 170 of the Karnataka Police Act, is well
settled by this Court, inter alia by its decisions referred
to above.
66. Sanction of the Government, to prosecute a
police officer, for any act related to the discharge of an
official duty, is imperative to protect the police officer
from facing harassive, retaliatory, revengeful and
frivolous proceedings. The requirement of sanction from
the Government, to prosecute would give an upright
police officer the confidence to discharge his official
duties efficiently, without fear of vindictive retaliation
by initiation of criminal action, from which he would be
protected under Section 197 of the Code of Criminal
Procedure, read with Section 170 of the Karnataka
Police Act. At the same time, if the policeman has
committed a wrong, which constitutes a criminal
offence and renders him liable for prosecution, he can
be prosecuted with sanction from the appropriate
67. Every offence committed by a police officer
does not attract Section 197 of the Code of Criminal
Procedure read with Section 170 of the Karnataka
Police Act. The protection given under Section 197 of
the Criminal Procedure Code read with Section 170 of
the Karnataka Police Act has its limitations. The
protection is available only when the alleged act done
by the public servant is reasonably connected with the
discharge of his official duty and official duty is not
merely a cloak for the objectionable act. An offence
committed entirely outside the scope of the duty of the police
officer, would certainly not require sanction. To cite an
example, a policeman assaulting a domestic help or indulging
in domestic violence would certainly not be entitled to
protection. However, if an act is connected to the discharge of
official duty of investigation of a recorded criminal case, the
act is certainly under colour of duty, no matter how illegal the
act may be.
68. If in doing an official duty a policeman has
acted in excess of duty, but there is a reasonable
connection between the act and the performance of the
official duty, the fact that the act alleged is in excess of
duty will not be ground enough to deprive the
policeman of the protection of the government sanction
for initiation of criminal action against him.
69. The language and tenor of Section 197 of the Code
of Criminal Procedure and Section 170 of the Karnataka Police
Act makes it absolutely clear that sanction is required not only
for acts done in discharge of official duty, it is also required for
an act purported to be done in discharge of official duty
and/or act done under colour of or in excess of such duty or
70. To decide whether sanction is necessary, the test is
whether the act is totally unconnected with official duty or
whether there is a reasonable connection with the official
duty. In the case of an act of a policeman or any other public
servant unconnected with the official duty there can be no
question of sanction. However, if the act alleged against a
policeman is reasonably connected with discharge of his
official duty, it does not matter if the policeman has exceeded
the scope of his powers and/or acted beyond the four corners
of law.”
The Apex Court, in the afore-quoted judgment, considers entire
spectrum of law as emanated from 1956 till the date of delivery
of the judgment, as to why it is imperative that protection under
Section 197 of the Cr.P.C. should be strictly construed to protect
public servants from fearless discharge of their official duties.
The said judgment would cover the issue in the case at hand on
all its fours insofar as sanction to prosecute a public servant, in
the case at hand - a police officer.
14. Insofar as non-obtaining of sanction from the hands of
the Competent Authority prior to the Court taking cognizance, it
is an admitted fact that in the case at hand, no sanction is
sought or accorded by the Competent Authority. Therefore, any
proceeding of taking cognizance and setting of criminal law in
motion thereon without sanction will lose its legs to stand and
would, therefore, suffer from want of tenability.
15. The contention of the learned counsel appearing for the
respondent that the petitioner had left the post by the time the
complaint was registered and, therefore, sanction is noted, only
to be repelled, as it is fundamentally flawed. Leaving the post
cannot be equated with leaving the service. Change of post will
not mean that the petitioner has ceased to be a public servant.
The petitioner continues to be a public servant in any post in the
cadre and the act performed by a public servant during any time
in service if sought to be given a colour of crime by wanting to
set the criminal law in motion, in some cases even after
retirement, sanction under Section 197 of the Cr.P.C. is
imperative. This is the purport of the law declared, as extracted
16. The judgments relied on by the learned senior counsel
representing the respondent would bring no assistance to him as
they are all judgments rendered in the peculiar facts of those
cases. It is no law, declared by the Apex Court that sanction
would not be required if the public servant has ceased to hold
that particular post. As long as the public servant remains a
public servant and his/her actions are sought to be alleged of
crime, sanction would become necessary. The judgment in the
case of PARKASH SINGH BADAL (supra) was concerning
requirement of sanction after PARKASH SINGH BADAL had
ceased to be the Chief Minister of Punjab. The act committed
while he was the Chief Minister was sought to be alleged after
cessation of office. The cadre officers would cease to become
public servants only on their cessation of service by any mode.
They cannot be compared to politicians. Same goes with every
judgment that is relied on by the learned senior counsel
appearing for the respondent.
17. The other judgments that are relied on are concerning
the fact whether sanction under Section 197 of the Cr.P.C.
would be required for acts performed by such public servant
which were not in the discharge of their official duty. The
reasonable connection between the official duty and the alleged
act committed by those public servants is what was considered
by the Apex Court in the other case – URMILA DEVI (supra).
Therefore, the judgments relied on in the case of D.DEVARAJA
(supra) and that of other High Courts is what would become
applicable to the case at hand and none of the armory from the
arsenal of the learned senior counsel appearing for the
respondent would support the case of the respondent, as the
judgment in the case of D.DEVARAJA (supra) is overwhelming
qua the facts of the case at hand. Therefore, I answer issue No.1
against the respondent holding that the learned Magistrate
could not have taken cognizance of the aforesaid offences
without an order of sanction for such prosecution from the
hands of the Competent Authority.
(ii) Whether the alleged communication/report dated
12-07-2017 amounts to defamation within the meaning of
ingredients    of   Section   499   of the    IPC  against    the
The second issue is as to whether the report submitted
would be defamatory also merits consideration. In my view, the
report was an official communication from the petitioner to the
head of the department. The factual happenings in the prison
were highlighted and what was being spoken about was only a
caution. A pure official communication without it being referred
to any other department or a quarter, cannot become the
ingredient of Section 499 of the IPC.            Section 499 of the IPC
“499. Defamation.—Whoever, by words either spoken
or intended to be read, or by signs or by visible
representations, makes or publishes any imputation
concerning any person intending to harm, or knowing or
having reason to believe that such imputation will harm, the
reputation of such person, is said, except in the cases
hereinafter excepted, to defame that person.
Explanation 1.—It may amount to defamation to impute
anything to a deceased person, if the imputation would harm
the reputation of that person if living, and is intended to be
hurtful to the feelings of his family or other near relatives.
Explanation 2.—It may amount to defamation to make
an imputation concerning a company or an association or
collection of persons as such.
Explanation 3.—An imputation in the form of an
alternative or expressed ironically, may amount to
defamation.
Explanation 4.—No imputation is said to harm a
person's reputation, unless that imputation directly or
indirectly, in the estimation of others, lowers the moral or
intellectual character of that person, or lowers the character of
that person in respect of his caste or of his calling, or lowers
the credit of that person, or causes it to be believed that the
body of that person is in a lothsome state, or in a state
generally considered as disgraceful.
A perusal at the provision of law that is invoked to bring in
allegations under Section 499 of the IPC clearly mandates that
one who makes or publishes any imputation concerning any
person with an intention to harm is said to defame the said
person, except the issues covered under the exceptions.
Therefore, making or publishing is the nucleus of the section.
The words makes or publishes if considered qua the impugned
communication, it becomes clear that even if it is made, it is not
published to any quarter by the petitioner.          Making of the
communication is also restricted to the reporting of outcome of
the inspection and between two people. It is, on its perusal, a
pure official communication between two people as to what was
happening in the prison during the inspection that was
conducted. In these circumstances, reference being made to the
judgment of the Apex Court in the case of RAJESH RANGARAJAN
V. CROP CARE FEDERATION OF INDIA AND ANOTHER4, becomes
apposite. The Apex Court considering an identical circumstance
of official communication has held as follows:
“2. Mr Raj Panjwani, learned Senior Counsel
appearing for the appellant has drawn our attention to
Annexure P-1, which is the Report of the Fact-Finding
Committee which deals with farmers' deaths due to
exposure to pesticides in Warangal District of Andhra
Pradesh. We have carefully perused the Report. The
relevant page of the Report, which is at p. 40 of the
paper book, clearly indicates that the Fact-Finding
Committee was not aimed at doing health study or in-
depth scientific investigation, but to do an indicative
study which would lead to a larger health study. The
general tenor of the Report indicates that the
Report was meant to focus the harmful effects of
exposure to pesticides. It is quite evident from the
Report that it was not meant to harm, hurt or
defame any individual or the manufacturing
company. Mr Panjwani, learned Senior Counsel
appearing for the appellant also fairly submitted that
the Report was not intended to harm or defame any
individual or manufacturers of pesticides.
3. In our considered opinion, the complaint
filed under Sections 120-B, 34, 500, 501 and 502
of the Penal Code, 1860 lacks basic ingredients.
According to our view, no useful purpose would be
served in permitting the trial court to proceed
with the complaint which lacks the basic
ingredients of the aforementioned sections.
Consequently, we quash the complaint.”
(Emphasis supplied)
The Apex Court was considering an official report by the
accused      therein   and    has    held   that  it  is  an   official
communication and no offence under Section 500 or 501 of the
IPC can be made out of such official communication.
19. In the light of the preceding analysis and the admitted
fact that no sanction is sought or granted by the Competent
Authority to prosecute the petitioner for offences punishable
under Sections 499 and 500 of the IPC and the fact that the
communication being purely official between two people, the
contents of it, in the considered view of this Court, would not
attract the ingredients of Section 499 of the IPC, as it cannot be
held to be defamatory. Therefore, I hold issue No.2 in favour of
the petitioner for the reasons indicated hereinabove.
20. It is trite that criminal prosecution is a serious matter;
it affects the liberty of a person, therefore, in cases where this
Court finds that permitting further proceedings would become
an abuse of the process of the law or would result in miscarriage
of justice, exercise of jurisdiction under Section 482 of the
Cr.P.C. to obliterate such proceedings would become imperative.
Wherefore, further proceedings against the petitioner, cannot be
permitted to be continued.
21. For the aforesaid reasons, I pass the following:
(i)  The Criminal Petition is allowed.
(ii) The impugned proceedings in C.C.No.2610 of 2020
pending before the IX Additional Chief Metropolitan
Magistrate, Bangalore stands quashed.
