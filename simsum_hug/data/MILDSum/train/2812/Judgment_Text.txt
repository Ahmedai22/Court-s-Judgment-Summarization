2   This appeal arises from a judgment of the Single Judge of the High Court of
Judicature at Allahabad in Criminal Miscellaneous Bail Application No 49007
of 2020. The first respondent sought bail under Section 439 of the Code of
Criminal Procedure during the pendency of the trial arising out of Case Crime
No 116 of 2020 for alleged offences punishable under Sections 147, 148,
149, 323, 307, 302 read with Section 34 of the Indian Penal Code (registered
at police station Singhwali Ahir, District Baghpat). The application was
allowed by the High Court.
3    Prior to the judgment of the High Court dated 9 November 2021, this Court in
its judgment dated 5 March 2021 (Rishipal @ Rishipal Singh Solanki vs
Amardeep and Others1) had occasion to consider the correctness of an
order dated 23 November 2020 granting bail to the co-accused, Amardeep
and Bhushan arising out of the same FIR. By the judgment of this Court dated
5 March 2021, the order of the High Court granting bail was set aside.
4    Notice was issued in these proceedings by an order dated 21 February 2022.
5    Mr Anupam Dwivedi, counsel has appeared on behalf of the appellant. Mr
Saurav Trivedi, counsel appears on behalf of the first respondent. Mr Sarvesh
Singh Baghel appears on behalf of the State of Uttar Pradesh.
6    We are unable to accept the approach of the High Court in granting bail to
the first respondent despite the judgment of this Court dated 5 March 2021
having been specifically drawn to its notice. The High Court has not held that
the case of the first respondent was distinguishable prima facie on facts for
evaluating the case for the grant of bail. As a matter of fact, the reasons
which have weighed with this Court in cancelling the bail which was granted
to the co-accused would equally apply to the case of the first respondent
which also arises out of the same first information report and incident.
7    We accordingly allow the appeal and set aside the impugned judgment and
order of the High Court dated 9 November 2021 granting bail to the first
respondent. The application for bail shall accordingly stand dismissed and
the first respondent shall surrender no later than within a week from the date
of this order.
8     If the trial is not concluded within a reasonable period, the first respondent
will be at liberty to pursue the remedies which are available in law.
9     Pending applications, if any, stand disposed of.
