name www.dream11.bet to be a gambling website, and offered phone
numbers and contact details in order to enable users to obtain the
necessary login credentials to place bets.
11.    Upon an investigation being conducted by the plaintiff, a person on
the other end helped the investigator set up his account after the transfer
of Rs. 5000/-. Using the login credentials, the investigator was able to
access the defendant’s website which contained the ‘Dream11 Marks’

12.    Complaining the acts of the defendant amount to infringement of
the plaintiffs’ trade marks as also passing off, the plaintiffs filed the
present suit inter-alia praying for a decree of permanent injunction
against the defendant.
13.    Initially, the plaintiffs had impleaded ‘GoDaddy.com,LLC’, the
Domain Name Registrar, as the defendant no. 2 for ensuring effective
implementation of any relief that this Court may grant in favour of the
plaintiffs and against the defendant.
14.    Later, vide order dated 24.11.2020 passed by the learned Joint

direction was also issued to YouTube LLC to suspend/remove/take down
the channel ‘Dream11.bet’ from its platform.
16.    As    noted   herein    above,    vide   order   dated    24.11.2020,
‘GoDaddy.com, LLC’ was deleted from the array of parties.
17.    As the defendant failed to file its Written Statement, its right to file
the same was closed by the learned Joint Registrar (Judicial) vide order
dated 14.07.2022.
18.    Vide order of this Court dated 10.11.2022, the defendant no. 1 was
proceeded ex-parte.
19.    The learned counsel for the plaintiffs submits that the acts of the
defendant, which primarily include the adoption of the plaintiffs’
‘Dream11 Marks’, amounts to infringement of the registered trade
marks of the plaintiffs as also passing off the services of the defendant as
those of the plaintiff. He states that the adoption of the ‘Dream11
Marks’ as a part of their trade name and domain name has been by the
defendant is mala fide and is intended to trade upon the reputation and
goodwill of the plaintiffs.
20.    The learned counsels for the plaintiffs assert that the adoption of
the ‘Dream11 Marks’ by the defendant for the activities of betting and
gambling are illegal under statutes, including but not limited to the Public
Gambling Act, 1867. The use of the ‘Dream11 Marks’ by the defendant
would be contrary to the judgments of the High Court of Punjab and
Haryana in Varun Gumber v. Union Territory of Chandigarh, 2017
SCC OnLine P&H 5372 and of the Division Bench of the High Court of
Signing Date:28.11.2022CS (COMM) 59/2020                                               Page 6 of 10
Bombay in Gurdeep Singh Sachar v. Union of India and Ors., 2019
SCC OnLine Bom 13059, wherein it was held that the business carried
out by the plaintiffs, that is of fantasy games, have an element of skill
and, thus, were held to be legal.
21.    The learned counsel for the plaintiffs, placing reliance on the
judgment of this Court in Satya Infrastructure Ltd. and Ors. v. Satya
Infra & Estates Pvt. Ltd., 2013 SCC OnLine Del 508, submits that as the
defendant has failed to appear in the proceedings and voluntarily chosen
not to respond to the plaint, it is indicative of the fact that the defendant
has nothing substantial to urge by way of a response to the allegations in
the plaint. He submits that this is a fit case where a Summary Judgment
in terms of Order XIII-A of the CPC, as applicable to commercial
disputes of a specified value, read with Rule 27 of the Delhi High Court
Intellectual Property Rights Division Rules, 2022 (in short, ‘IPD Rules’)
deserves to be passed in favour of the plaintiffs and against the defendant.
22.    I have considered the submissions of the learned counsel for the
plaintiffs.
23.    From the averments made in the plaint and the documents filed
therewith, the plaintiffs have been able to prove that they are the
registered proprietor of the ‘Dream11 Marks’, the details whereof are
given herein above. The plaintiffs have also been able to show their
goodwill and reputation in the ‘Dream11 Marks’ not only in India but
across the globe. The domain name adopted by the defendant, that is,
www.dream11.bet is deceptively similar to that of the plaintiffs and is
Signing Date:28.11.2022CS (COMM)   59/2020                                              Page 7 of 10
clearly intended to ride on the goodwill and reputation of the marks of the
plaintiffs.
24.    The adoption of the domain name www.dream11.bet is a clear case
of infringement of the marks of the plaintiffs and amounts to passing off
the services of the defendant as that of the plaintiffs. The defendant not
only intends to take unfair advantage of the marks of the plaintiffs and
ride on the reputation of the plaintiffs’ marks, but also deceive unwary
consumer of their association with the plaintiffs. Such acts of the
defendant would also lead to dilution of the mark of the plaintiffs.
25.    In Anugya Gupta v. Ajay Kumar and Anr., 2022 SCC OnLine Del
1922, this Court has held that the right of a proprietor in a domain name
is entitled to equal protection, applying the principles of the trade mark
law. The use of the same or similar domain name may lead to diversion
of users, which could result from such users mistakenly accessing one
domain name instead of another. Therefore, a domain name may have all
the characteristics of a trade mark and could found an action for passing
26.    In the present case, the defendant has chosen neither to file its
written statements nor to enter appearance in the suit to defend the same.
In my opinion, therefore, this is a fit case where a Summary Judgment in
terms of Order XIII-A of the CPC, as applicable to commercial disputes
of a specified value, read with Rule 27 of the IPD Rules deserves to be
passed in favour of the plaintiffs and against the defendant. This Court, in
Su-Kam Power Systems Ltd. v. Kunwer Sachdev and Another, 2019
SCC OnLine Del 10764 has held as under:
Signing Date:28.11.2022CS (COMM)   59/2020                                            Page 8 of 10
“90. To reiterate, the intent behind incorporating
the summary judgment procedure in the
Commercial Court Act, 2015 is to ensure disposal
of commercial disputes in a time-bound manner.
In fact, the applicability of Order XIIIA, CPC to
commercial disputes, demonstrates that the trial is
no longer the default procedure/norm.
91. Rule 3 of Order XIIIA, CPC, as applicable to
commercial disputes, empowers the Court to grant
a summary judgement against the defendant
where the Court considers that the defendant has
no real prospects of successfully defending the
claim and there is no other compelling reason why
the claim should not be disposed of before
recording of oral evidence. The expression “real”
directs the Court to examine whether there is a
“realistic” as opposed to “fanciful” prospects of
success. This Court is of the view that the
expression “no genuine issue requiring a trial” in
Ontario Rules of Civil Procedure and “no other
compelling reason….. for trial” in Commercial
Courts Act can be read mutatis mutandis.
Consequently, Order XIIIA, CPC would be
attracted if the Court, while hearing such an
application, can make the necessary finding of
fact, apply the law to the facts and the same is a
proportionate, more expeditious and less
expensive means of achieving a fair and just
result.
92. Accordingly, unlike ordinary suits, Courts
need not hold trial in commercial suits, even if
there are disputed questions of fact as held by the
Canadian Supreme Court in Robert Hryniak v.
Fred Mauldin, 2014 SCC OnLine Can SC 53, in
the event, the Court comes to the conclusion that
the defendant lacks a real prospect of successfully
defending the claim.”
27.     In view of the above, the plaintiffs have been able to make out a
case for grant of prayers made in paragraph nos. 33 (A) and (B) of the
plaint.

28.    The Suit is decreed in favour of the plaintiffs and against the
defendant in terms of prayers made in paragraph nos. 33 (A) and (B) of
the plaint. The plaintiff is also held entitled to the costs of the Suit.
