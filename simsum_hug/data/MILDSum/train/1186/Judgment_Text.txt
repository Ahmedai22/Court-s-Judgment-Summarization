Through: Mr. Anurag Ahluwalia CGSC for ED.
1.       This hearing has been done through hybrid mode.
2.       The Petitioner - State Bank of India has filed the present petition
seeking setting aside of the impugned order dated 22nd December, 2021
passed by the Adjudicating Authority (PMLA).
3.       The case of the Petitioner is that it’s case has not even been
considered by the Adjudicating Authority (PMLA) despite filing a detailed
reply and explaining its position along with its documents and decisions
relied upon. It is submitted that the Adjudicating Authority (PMLA) is
passing template cut-paste orders and the same has been demonstrated to the
Court by the ld. Counsel for the Petitioner through a compilation of similar
orders passed by the Adjudicating Authority.
4.       The Court has also perused the same and it appears that at least in
respect of portions of the orders relating to compliance under 5(1) and 8(1)
of the PMLA, 2002, the Adjudicating Authority (PMLA) is using identical

paragraphs as is seen in several orders. As an illustration, two paragraphs
are extracted below:
In the present case, in relation to the scheduled offences
the charge sheet is not filed against the accused named. In
view thereof the Director or any other officer not below
the rank of Deputy Director authorized by the Director for
the purposes of section 5 of PMLA is empowered to issue
an order of attachment of property in terms of second
proviso under section 5(1) of PMLA. In the present case
the Deputy Director has passed the PAOs on the
reasonable belief that if property involved in money
laundering is not attached immediately under Chapter-III
of the Act, the non-attachment of the property is likely to
frustrate proceeding under the Act. The empowerment to
issue PAO is conditional to the formation of requisite
reasonable belief, (the reasons for such belief to be
recorded in writing, on the basis of material in his
possession) that if property involved in money laundering
is not attached immediately under Chapter-III of the Act,
the non- attachment of the property is likely to frustrate
proceeding under the Act.
In the present case there is no dispute as to the authority
of the Deputy Director to pass the provisional attachment
Order. While examining the compliance of section 5, what
is required to be seen in the present case is that the Deputy
Director has entertained the reasonable belief on the basis
of material in his possession and secondly whether the
reason for such belief are recorded in writing or not.

5.       Use of identical templated paragraphs could reflect as non-application
of mind by the Authority concerned and hence ought to be avoided. The
Adjudicating Authority is cautioned about passing such templated orders.
6.       The above position shall be brought to the notice of the Adjudicating
Authority by ld. Counsel appearing for the Enforcement Directorate.
7.       The Petitioner has also preferred the appeal before the Appellate
Tribunal (PMLA) at the relevant point of time, however, since the Tribunal
was not duly constituted, the present writ petition was filed.
8.       It is the admitted position that the Appellate Tribunal (PMLA) is now
constituted under the PMLA, 2002. The order under challenge is an

Attachment Order which is appealable to the Appellate Tribunal (PMLA).
Accordingly, the Petitioner is relegated to the Appellate Tribunal (PMLA) to
avail of its appellate remedies before the same. The appeal of the Petitioner
shall now be listed and taken up by the Appellate Tribunal, for adjudication
in accordance with law.
9.       All contentions of the parties are left open.
10.      With these observations, the present petition, along with all pending
applications, is disposed of.
