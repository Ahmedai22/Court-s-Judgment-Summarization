CORAM: HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE TEJINDER SINGH DHINDSA
            HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE PANKAJ JAIN
Present:-   Mr. Divya Suri, Advocate and
            Mr. Sachin Bhardwaj, Advocate for the petitioner.
            Mr. Rajesh Katoch Sr. Standing Counsel and
            Ms. Pridhi Jaswinder Sandhu, Jr. Standing Counsel
            for respondents No.2 and 3.
            The instant writ petition is directed against the re-assessment order
dated 31.03.2022 (Annexure P-11) passed under Section 147 read with Section
144-B of the Income Tax Act 1961. In the writ petition one of the primary
grounds of challenge raised was that the impugned order has been passed in
undue haste and in negation of the principles of natural justice.
            The specific averments in such regard are contained in Ground B of
Para 18 to the effect that the draft assessment order/show cause notice dated
30.03.2022 (Annexure P-9) was issued to the petitioner at 20.42 P.M. calling
upon the assessee to furnish a reply on the same date itself i.e.30.03.2022 by
23.59 P.M. and the final order has been passed on the next day i.e. 31.03.2022.
            The petition had come up for preliminary hearing before us on
17.05.2022 and on such short ground we had called upon Mr. Rajesh Katoch, Sr.
Standing Counsel for respondents No.2 and 3 to complete instructions.
              CWP-9810-2022 (O&M)                                      -2-
              During the course of resumed hearing today the factual premise as
noticed hereinabove and as contained in ground B of Para 18 is not disputed.
              There would be no gainsaying the assessee ought to have been
furnished a reasonable time to respond to the draft assessment order/show cause
notice so as to comply with the principles of natural justice. The same would
also be consonance with a fair and transparent procedure.
              In view of the above and without opining on the merits of the case,
the impugned re-assessment order dated 31.03.2022 (Annexure P-11) is set
              Liberty is granted to the respondents to proceed afresh in the matter
as regards framing of re-assessment order de novo from the stage of issuance of
the draft assessment order/show cause notice dated 30.03.2022 and conclude
proceedings within a period of four months from today after affording due and
adequate opportunity to the assessee.
              At the cost of repetition, it is clarified that the impugned re-
assessment order dated 31.03.2022 (Annexure P-11) has been set aside only on
the ground that due opportunity had not been afforded to the assessee to respond
to the draft assessment order/show cause notice dated 30.03.2022 and this Court
has not delved into the merits of the case.
              Disposed of.
