2    By a judgment dated 14 August 2014, the Additional Sessions Judge,
Ghaziabad, acquitted the second to sixth respondents in Sessions Trial No
2125 of 2012, where they were tried for having committed offences
punishable under Section 302 read with Section 149, Section 304B and
Section 498A of the Indian Penal Code and Sections 3 and 4 of the Dowry
Prohibition Act. The judgment of the trial Judge was sought to be assailed
before the High Court by the appellant, the original informant, by filing an
application for leave to appeal, being Criminal Miscellaneous Application
(Leave to Appeal No 351/2014). The Division Bench of the High Court of
Judicature at Allahabad dismissed the application on the basis of the
“On a careful perusal of the judgment and record, it cannot
be said that the view taken by the trial judge is perverse or
unreasonable. Simply because another view might have
been taken of the evidence provides no ground for
interfering with the order of acquittal unless the view taken
by the trial judge is not a possible view. On the evidence
available on record, it cannot be said that the view taken by
the trial judge was not a reasonably possible view.
In this view of the matter, there is no merit in the
application for leave to appeal which is rejected and
consequently the Appeal is also dismissed.”
3     Notice was issued in the Special Leave Petition on 17 October 2016 after
condoning the delay. In pursuance of the notice, Mr Z U Khan has appeared
on behalf of the second to sixth respondents.
4     Ms Sonia Mathur, senior counsel appearing on behalf of the appellant has
submitted that while considering an application for the grant of leave to
appeal against the order of acquittal, the High Court was required to
scrutinize the evidence and findings and to determine as to whether leave
should be granted to appeal. In this context, learned counsel placed reliance
on the provisions of Section 378 of the Code of Criminal Procedure 1973 and
on the decision of this Court in State of Madhya Pradesh vs Giriraj
5     On the other hand, Mr Z U Khan, learned counsel for the second to sixth
respondents submits that there are concurrent findings of fact which have
led to the acquittal of the accused and he sought to invite the attention of
the Court to the findings which have been recorded by the trial Court.
6     Having evaluated the rival submissions, we are of the view that the
impugned judgment of the High Court does not meet the requirements
which are to be observed, consistent with the provisions of Section 378 of
the Code of Criminal Procedure 1973, where the High Court hears an
application for leave to appeal against an order of acquittal. In State of
Madhya Pradesh vs Giriraj Dubey (supra), a two-Judge Bench of this
Court has extensively adverted to the precedents of this Court on the
subject. The earlier decisions which have been followed in the above
decision are: (i) State of Maharashtra vs Vithal Rao Pritirao Chawan 2;
(ii) State of Orissa vs Dhaniram Luhar 3, (iii) State of Rajasthan vs.
Sohan Lal4; (iv) State of U.P. vs Ajai Kumar5; and (v) State of
Maharashtra vs Sujay Mangesh Poyarekar6. The principle which has
been enunciated is that the High Court must set forth its reasons, indicating
at least in brief, an application of mind to the nature of the evidence and the
findings which have been arrived at. In other words, merely observing that
the order of the trial Judge has taken a possible view without an application
of mind to the evidence and the findings is not consistent with the duty
which is cast upon the High Court while determining whether leave should
be granted to appeal against an order of acquittal.
7     In State of Orissa vs Dhaniram Luhar (supra), the principles which must
govern a case such as the present, where the High Court is requested to
grant leave to appeal against an order of acquittal by the trial court have
been enunciated. The Court has observed:
“6. The trial court was required to carefully appraise the entire
evidence and then come to a conclusion. If the trial court was at
lapse in this regard the High Court was obliged to undertake
such an exercise by entertaining the appeal. The trial court on
the facts of this case did not perform its duties, as was enjoined
on it by law. The High Court ought to have in such circumstances
granted leave and thereafter as a first court of appeal,
reappreciated the entire evidence on the record independently
and returned its findings objectively as regards guilt or otherwise
of the accused. It has failed to do so. The questions involved
were not trivial. The effect of the admission of the accused in the
background of testimony of official witnesses and the documents
exhibited needed adjudication in appeal. The High Court has not
given any reasons for refusing to grant leave to file appeal
against acquittal, and seems to have been completely oblivious
to the fact that by such refusal, a close scrutiny of the order of
acquittal, by the appellate forum, has been lost once and for all.
The manner in which appeal against acquittal has been dealt
with by the High Court leaves much to be desired. Reasons
introduce clarity in an order. On plainest consideration of justice,
the High Court ought to have set forth its reasons, howsoever
brief in its order, indicative of an application of its mind; all the
more when its order is amenable to further avenue of challenge.
The absence of reasons has rendered the High Court order not
sustainable. Similar view was expressed                 in State   of
U.P. v. Battan [(2001) 10 SCC 607: 2003 SCC (Cri) 639]. About
two decades back in State of Maharashtra v. Vithal Rao Pritirao
1215] the desirability of a speaking order while dealing with an
application for grant of leave was highlighted. The requirement
of indicating reasons in such cases has been judicially
recognised as imperative. The view was reiterated in Jawahar Lal
Singh v. Naresh Singh [(1987) 2 SCC 222: 1987 SCC (Cri) 347].
Judicial discipline to abide by declaration of law by this Court,
cannot be forsaken, under any pretext by any authority or court,
be it even the highest court in a State, oblivious to Article 141 of
the Constitution.”
8     These principles have been more recently followed in a judgment of this
Court in Chaman Lal vs State of Himachal Pradesh 7 [Criminal Appeal No
1229 of 2017, decided on 3 December 2020].
9     The Court has been apprised of the fact that the State of Uttar Pradesh had
also filed an application for leave to appeal against the judgment of
acquittal by the trial court and leave to appeal was denied by the High Court
on 7 July 2015. However, it is common ground that in declining to grant
leave to the State to appeal, the High Court followed order which is
impugned in the present appeal, in which the informant was denied leave to
appeal by the judgment of the High Court dated 24 September 2014.
10    For the above reasons, we are of the view that an order of remand would be
warranted to the High Court. We accordingly allow the appeal and set aside
the impugned judgment and order of the High Court dated 24 September
2014 and remit Criminal Miscellaneous Application (Leave to Appeal No
351/2014) to the High Court of Judicature at Allahabad for determination
afresh.
11    Pending applications, if any, stand disposed of.
