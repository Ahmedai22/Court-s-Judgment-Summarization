(BY SRI.R SRINIVASA GOWDA, AGA FOR R1 TO R4;
    SRI.R.VISHWANATH HEGDE, ADVOCATE FOR R5)
      THIS WRIT PETITION IS FILED UNDER ARTICLES 226
AND 227 OF THE CONSTITUTION OF INDIA PRAYING TO
      The short grievance of the Petitioners regardless of
the lengthy pleadings & prayer is as to land forcibly being
taken away by the Authorities for the expansion of the
road in question even     when they are not agreeable
      2.     Learned counsel for the Petitioners argues
that the Right to Property though not a Fundamental
Right is constitutionally guaranteed under Article 300A;
his clients cannot be compelled to give up their property
except in accordance with law; his clients are not
agreeable for relinquishing their property and therefore,
if at all the State wants these properties, the acquisition
process under 2013 Act is the only course open.          He
argues that his clients’ ownership & possession should be
protected from interference of the Respondents save with
the authority of law.
      3.     Learned AGA appearing for the State and the
learned Panel Counsel appearing for the Respondent –
Authority together submit that some of land owners have
agreed and accordingly given up their lands by executing
Relinquishment Deeds and therefore, this course is open
to the Petitioners as well wherein the compensation
payable would be three times the Guideline value
keeping     in  view  the  provisions  of  Right  to   Fair
Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition,
Rehabilitation   and   Resettlement    Act,  2013.     So
contending, they both seek dismissal of these Writ
      4.    Having heard the learned counsel for the
parties and having perused the Petition Papers, this
Court is broadly in agreement with the submission made
on behalf of the Petitioners that their lands cannot be
touched by the State and the authorities, save by
acquisition in accordance with law the Right to Property
having been constitutionally guaranteed. If others have
given up their land, that cannot be a legal ground to
compel the Petitioners to give up their land too, since
constitutionally guaranteeed avails to the property of
individuals   and   not  necessarily   the  collection  of
individuals.    An   argument   to   the  contrary   would
undermine the sanctity    & efficacy of Article 300A and
therefore, cannot be countenanced.
      In the above circumstances, these Writ Petitions
succeed in part; the Respondents are restrained from
interfering with the properties of the Petitioners till after
the same are acquired in accordance with law, namely
      Ordered accordingly.
      No costs.
