The petitioner is a company assessed to income tax on the file of the sole
respondent in terms of the provisions of Income Tax Act, 1961 (in short ‘Act’).
In respect of assessment year (AY) 2012-13 a return of income had been filed
disclosing income both under the regular provisions as well as under the
provisions of Minimum Alternate Tax (in short ‘MAT’).
2. Proceedings for amalgamation had been ongoing at that particular
juncture, in Company Petition Nos.190 and 191 of 2012 for amalgamation of
the petitioner with one, Island Hotel Maharaj Limited. By order dated
06.02.2013 the scheme of amalgamation had been approved by this Court,
merging the aforesaid two entities. The appointed date was fixed as 01.04.2011.
3. The scheme provided for the merging of the assets and liabilities as
well as the method of accounting to be followed in respect of the merged assets.
The accounting was to be under the pooling of interest method adopting
accounting standard (AS 14) that provided for the methodology for accounting
for amalgamations, issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India.
4. Post-amalgamation, a revised return had come to be filed by the
petitioner, once again computing the income both under regular provisions as
well the under the provisions of Minimum Alternate Tax (MAT). The brought
forward loss in the hands of the petitioner (amalgamated entity) is as follows:-
Surplus in Statement of Profit and Loss
Less: Adjustment of Debit balance of Profit 505,251,912
& Loss Account of Transferor Company
Add: Profit/(Loss) during the year           (306, 552, 091)
5. Thus and admittedly, the amount of brought forward loss is a sum of
Rs.30,65,52,091/- and the amount of brought forward depreciation is a sum of
Rs.18,05,97,492/-. There is no dispute with regard to the aforesaid two
figures.The petitioner, in computing the income under the provisions of MAT,
applied the provisions of Section 115JB of the Act and, interalia, the upward
and downward adjustments set out under the Explanations thereunder.
6. As per the methodology of computation prescribed, the lower of either
book depreciation or loss of the transferor company, was to be set of against the
adjusted book profit. Applying the aforesaid methodology, the adjusted book
profit arrived at in the present case was ‘nil’. Since the amount of book
depreciation constituted the lower of the two figures, the same was taken into
the reckoning for arriving at the adjusted book profit. This procedure followed
aligns with the prescription and the methodology set out under Section 115JB.
7. An order of assessment came to be passed thereafter on 26.03.2015,
the Assessing Authority computing income both under regular provisions as
well as under the provisions of MAT. As far as the latter is concerned the
computation is as follows:-
Add: Expenses attributable to income exempt                22,66,356
8. The Assessing Authority has neither mechanically adopted the figures
supplied by the petitioner nor the methodology for computation of book profit
as he adds expenses attributable to exempt income, increasing the taxable book
profit for the purposes of Section 115JB. Thus the order of assessment passed
under scrutiny is a reasoned order passed after the application of mind upon the
computation furnished by the petitioner.
9. The impugned proceedings for re-assessment have to be seen in this
context. Notice under Section 148 of the Act was issued on 21.03.2019, barely
10 days prior to the expiry of the six year period which places an absolute bar
upon reassessment, except in certain stipulated situations,that do not arise in the
present case.
10. The petitioner complied with the notice reiterating its computation
made at the original instance (by way of revised return) and sought the reasons
for re-opening of the assessment. The reasons supplied are as follows:-
“2.1 . The assessee's subsidiary M/s. Island Hotel Maharaj Limited
amalgamated with the effective from 28.02.2013 (effective date) vide
2.2 The assessee filed its revised return of income on 28.03.2013
declaring NIL income after setting - off the total income of
Rs.14,58,76,516/- against unabsorbed depreciation loss/brought
forward business loss . The assessee offered NIL book profit u/s
115JB after reducing book loss of transferor Company amounting to
2.3 . During the scrutiny assessment u/s 143 (3), an addition of Rs.
55,25,821/- was made amounting to Rs.15,14,02,337/ - under normal
computation. However, the assessed income has become NIL after
setting-off with the brought forward business loss/ unabsorbed
depreciation loss. An addition of Rs.22,66,356/- was made to the
book profit u/ s 115JB totalling to 18,28,63,848/ - . However, the
assessment was completed with NIL book profit after setting - off with
the brought forward book loss of the transferor company (M / s.
2.4 . It is seen from the ' Post Amalgamation Annual A/Cs for the year
ending 31.03.2012 under Schedule ' Reserves of Surplus ' that the
assessee company had Rs . 50.00 crores opening balance in the
general reserve and Rs. 19.87 crores in Surplus Statement of Profit &
Loss a / c . thereby totalling to Rs . 69.87 crores , before
amalgamation . The loss available in the books of the transferor
company was Rs.50.52 crores as on 31.03.2011 (i.e.,) before
amalgamation . Thus, it is seen that no book loss or depreciation is
available to be deducted u / s 115JB as detailed below :”
Before amalgamation as on 31.03.2011
Surplus in P&L a/c    19,86,99,821
Less: Loss of the transferor company (M/s.Island Hotel (50,52,51,912)
Accumulated book profit as on 31.03.2011                        19,34,47,909
“2.5 It is evident from the above that there is no book loss or
depreciation available, rather there is a book profit of
Rs.19,34,47,909/- . Therefore, the set - off of Rs.18,28,63,848/- as
brought forward book loss against the book profit is required to be
disallowed and brought to tax u / s 115JB .
2.6. In these circumstances , I have reasons to believe that the income
has escaped assessment in the case of the assessee for AY 2012-13
within the meaning of Section 147 of the Income Tax Act,1961.”
11. The premise upon which the assessment has been re-opened is that
the loss available was a sum of Rs.50.52 Crores and no book loss or
depreciation was available to be deducted under Section 115 JB.However the
computation accompanying the revised return reveals depreciation of a sum of
Rs.18.05 crores.
12. That apart, the challenge is on the assumption of jurisdiction by the
Assessing Officer, seeing as the provisions of Section 147 of the Act impose a
pre-condition that, for the department to proceed for reassessment beyond a
period of 4 years, the burden was upon it to establish that the assessee
concerned had made an incomplete and untrue disclosure at the first instance.
In the present proceedings the reopening is beyond the period of four years
from the end of relevant assessment year.
13.The officer considered the objections raised by the petitioner and
rejects the same vide the impugned order dated 31.07.2019. Incidentally, the
officer erroneously states therein, that the reassessment had been initiated
within four years from the end of the relevant assessment year. However this
factual error has been rectified in the counter.
14. A perusal of the impugned order leaves me in no doubt that the
Officer has proceeded entirely on the mistaken assumption that the re-
assessment was within a period of four years. It is in this context that he refers
to explanation 1 to Section 147,that reads as follows:
“Production before the assessing officer of account books
or other evidence from which material evidence could with due
diligence have been discovered by the assessing officer will not
necessarily amount to disclosure within the meaning of the
proviso to Sec.147 of the IT Act.”
15. However the proviso to Section 147, which is extracted below is a
statutory pre-condition that has to be complied with by the Assessing Officer
and places a significant burden upon the Officer that must be discharged, prior
to proceeding with the re-assessment beyond the period of four years from the
end of the relevant assessment year. The provision and proviso thereunder read
Income escaping assessment.
“147. If the 73[Assessing] Officer 74[has reason to
believe75] that any income chargeable to tax has escaped
assessment75 for any assessment year, he may, subject to the
provisions of sections 148 to 153, assess or reassess75 such
income and also any other income chargeable to tax which has
escaped assessment and which comes to his notice subsequently
in the course of the proceedings under this section, or re-
compute the loss or the depreciation allowance or any other
allowance, as the case may be, for the assessment year
concerned (hereafter in this section and in sections 148 to 153
referred to as the relevant assessment year) :
Provided that where an assessment under sub-section (3)
of section 143 or this section has been made for the relevant
assessment year, no action shall be taken under this section
after the expiry of four years from the end of the relevant
assessment year, unless any income chargeable to tax has
escaped assessment for such assessment year by reason of the
failure76 on the part of the assessee to make a return under
section 139 or in response to a notice issued under sub section
(1) of section 142 or section 148 or to disclose fully and truly
all material facts necessary for his assessment, for that
16. It is a well settled position that in cases of reopening beyond the
period of four years from the end of the relevant assessment year, the statutory
pre-condition set out in the proviso to Section 147 of the Act must first be
complied with prior to invoking the benefit under the Explanations.
17. It is an equally well settled rule of construction that the interpretation
of a statutory provision, must be in the sequence in which the sub-sections and
clauses are arranged. Thus the construction of Section 147 is relevant and must
be appreciated and applied in seriatim. The proviso is placed at the first
instance and the Explanations thereafter and this would mean that the statutory
condition and burden cast upon the Department by virtue of the first proviso
must first be discharged by the officer, before he proceeds to avail benefit of
the deeming explanations that follow thereafter.
18. The test would thus be as to whether the disclosure made by the
petitioner at the time of original assessment was full and complete. There is no
dispute in this regard and all material in regard to the computation of tax under
the provisions of MAT were available before the Assessing Authority.
19. The reasons proceed on the basis that the methodology for
computation is erroneous which premise, as noticed earlier, does not appear to
be correct as the financials disclose the availability of depreciation. In such
circumstances, the assumption of jurisdiction under Section 147 is held to be
bad in law.
20. That apart, I also find force in the submission that there is no
allegation in the reason itself to the effect that there has been any incomplete
disclosure or false statement made at the time of assessment that would justify
the assumption of jurisdiction beyond the period of four years.
21. The petitioner also raises the argument that the impugned
proceedings are based on an audit objection though none of the documents on
record would evidence this position. However, there is an averment in the
affidavit to this effect and the counter filed by the respondent does not
specifically deny this.
22. Thus even on this score and following the settled position that an
audit objection does not satisfy the requirement of the Assessing Officer having
an independent ‘reason to believe’ that income has escaped assessment, that too
after the elapse of nearly six years from the end of the relevant assessment year,
the impugned proceedings are vitiated.
23. In light of the discussions above, this writ petition is allowed and the
impugned proceedings are quashed. Connected writ miscellaneous petitions are
closed. No costs.
