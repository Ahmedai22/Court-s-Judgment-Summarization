A Full Bench of the Calcutta High Court has decided that it will not extend the life of interim orders, that were earlier extended in view of the lockdown induced by Covid-19 pandemic. Thus, the extensions granted will expire on March 31, 2021.

 The order stated,
 "We do not see any reason to extend the original order any further beyond March 31st, 2021, except as regards the matters which we specifically order hereinbelow." 
 These exceptions are as follows:

 This order is also applicable to orders pertaining to Original Side of the Court, the Bench said.
