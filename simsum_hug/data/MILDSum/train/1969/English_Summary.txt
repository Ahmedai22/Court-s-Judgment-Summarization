The Delhi High Court has permanently restrained a total of 732 rogue websites from broadcasting and streaming the Ajay Devgn starrer movie "Bhuj: The Pride of India."
Directed by Bhuj Abhishek Dudhaiya, the film was released on August 13 last year. The movie relates to the Indo-Pak war of 1971 and has now been released on various online and OTT platforms. 
Justice Pratibha M Singh decreed a suit filed last year by Star India Private Limited and Novi Digital Entertainment Private Limited against 42 rogue websites seeking that the websites be restrained permanently from communicating the film to the public. 
On August 9 last year, the court had passed an order of interim injunction against the 42 rogue websites as set out in the plaint, restraining them from broadcasting the movie.
However, despite the interim order, the court was apprised that additional URLs and domain names were also illegally streaming the film. In this regard, the plaintiffs then filed affidavits bringing on record various other domain names and websites. 
Noting that the movie has already been released on various platforms including the OTT platforms and other online platforms, the court ordered:
"In view thereof, since the rights of the Plaintiffs are not in question, a permanent injunction is liable to be granted in terms of paragraph 66(i) of the plaint against all the rogue websites i.e., Defendant Nos. 1 to 42 and the other domain names added by subsequent affidavits totalling 689 additional websites/ domain names."
The court also directed the domain name registrars to ensure that the impugned domain names are suspended, locked and status quo is maintained in respect of the same. 
"The same shall not be permitted to be transferred to any third party. The orders of blocking shall also stand confirmed permanently in respect of all the impugned domain names / websites," the court added.
