for the applicant.
This application under Section 11(6) of the Arbitration and
Conciliation Act, 1996 (in short the Act) seeking appointment of an arbitrator
has been filed by the applicant on 28.04.2017.
The claim is based on the fact that the applicant entered into an
agreement with the respondents on 23.04.2004 for widening and strengthening
on Dabwali Kalanwali via Desujodha Road K.M. 0.00 to 35.10 in Sirsa
District. The work was to be completed within a period of twelve months,
whereas it was completed on 31.05.2007. A dispute arose between the parties
on account of the fact that an inquiry by the State Vigilance Bureau was
conducted in respect of certain issues and, therefore, payment of the applicant
was withheld. The applicant thereafter filed an application seeking
appointment of an arbitrator by issuing a legal notice to the respondents on
11.04.2011         (Annexure P-3) pursuant to which the respondents sent a letter
dated 28.04.2011 (Annexure R-1) asking the applicant to deposit 10% of the
claim amount immediately well before the limitation period so that the
arbitrator could be appointed. The communication clearly stated that in case
the applicant failed to deposit the claim amount well before the limitation
period, it would be responsible for the delay. Thereafter, several
correspondences took place between the parties and the respondents continued
to reiterate their stand on the deposit of 10% of the claim amount which was
admittedly not deposited by the applicant. Ultimately, the applicant filed this
application under Section 11 of the Act before this Court on 28.04.2017.
The preliminary objection raised by the respondents is that the
application filed by the applicant seeking appointment of an arbitrator is barred
by limitation on account of delay and laches and, therefore, deserves to be
Learned counsel for the applicant in support of his submission
that the application is not barred by limitation has relied upon the decision of
the Supreme Court rendered in the case of M/s Mayavti Trading Pvt. Ltd. Vs
Pradyuat Deb Burman, 2019 (8) SCC 714 to contend that the question of
staleness of the claim or as to whether the claim made in the arbitration
proceeding is barred by limitation or not cannot be or should not be decided in
Section 11 proceedings and the said issue should be left to be decided by the
arbitrator. It is contended that the issue in Section 11 proceedings is confined
only to the extent of an arbitration agreement and for appointing an arbitrator.
It is submitted that in such circumstances, the preliminary objection regarding
delay and laches raised by the respondents deserves to be rejected and in terms
of the arbitration clause, the arbitrator should be appointed. It is further
submitted that the letter dated 28.04.2011 (Annexure R-1) sent by the
respondents regarding deposit of 10% of the claim amount is also untenable in
view of the law laid down by the Supreme Court in the case of
M/s ICOMM Tele Ltd. Vs Punjab State Water Supply & Sewerage Board and
Learned State counsel, appearing for the respondents, per contra
has relied upon the decision of the Supreme Court rendered in
(5) SCC 705 and Bharat Sanchar Nigam Ltd. Vs M/s Nortel Networks India
Pvt. Ltd., 2021 (5) SCC 738 to contend that the issue involved in the present
application is not regarding staleness of the claim, but as to whether the
application under Section 11(6) is barred by limitation on account of delay and
laches and as the Section 11(6) application is barred by limitation, it be
I have heard the learned counsel for the parties at length.
Evidently, the issue involved in the present case is as to whether the present
application is barred by limitation. The law in that respect has been
summarized by the Supreme Court in the case of Secunderabad Cantonment
Board (supra), wherein the Supreme Court has held as under:-
14. Having heard the learned counsel appearing for both parties,
it is first necessary to refer to the recent judgment of this Court
in Geo Miller & Co. (P) Ltd. v. Rajasthan Vidyut Utpadan Nigam
Ltd. [Geo Miller & Co. (P) Ltd. v. Rajasthan Vidyut Utpadan
Nigam Ltd., (2020) 14 SCC 643], which extracts passages from
all the earlier relevant judgments, and then lays down as to when
time begins to run for the purpose of filing an application under
Section 11 of the Arbitration Act. This Court, after referring to the
relevant statutory provisions, held: (SCC pp. 649-52, paras 15,
“15. In Damodar Das [State of Orissa v. Damodar Das,
(1996) 2 SCC 216], this Court observed, relying
upon Russell on Arbitration by Anthony Walton (19th
Edn.) at pp. 4-5 and an earlier decision of a two-Judge
Bench in Panchu Gopal Bose v. Port of Calcutta [Panchu
Gopal Bose v. Port of Calcutta, (1993) 4 SCC 338], that
the period of limitation for an application for appointment
of arbitrator under Sections 8 and 20 of the 1940 Act
commences on the date on which the “cause of
arbitration” accrued i.e. from the date when the claimant
first acquired either a right of action or a right to require
that an arbitration take place upon the dispute concerned.
21. Applying the aforementioned principles to the present
case, we find ourselves in agreement with the finding of
the High Court [Geo Miller & Co. v. Rajasthan Vidyut
RLW 429] that the appellant's cause of action in respect of
Arbitration Applications Nos. 25/2003 and 27/2003,
relating to the work orders dated 7-10-1979 and 4-4-1980
arose on 8-2-1983, which is when the final bill handed
over to         the respondent became            due.   Mere
correspondence of the appellant by way of writing
letters/reminders to the respondent subsequent to this
date would not extend the time of limitation. Hence the
maximum period during which this Court could have
allowed the appellant's application for appointment of an
arbitrator is 3 years from the date on which cause of
action arose i.e. 8-2-1986. Similarly, with respect to
Arbitration Application No. 28/2003 relating to the work
order dated 3-5-1985, the respondent has stated that final
bill was handed over and became due on 10-8-1989. This
has not been disputed by the appellant. Hence the
limitation period ended on 10-8-1992. Since the appellant
served notice for appointment of arbitrator in 2002, and
requested the appointment of an arbitrator before a court
only by the end of 2003, his claim is clearly barred by
limitation.
23. Turning to the other decisions, it is true that in Inder
Singh Rekhi [Inder Singh Rekhi v. DDA, (1988) 2 SCC
338] , this Court observed that the existence of a dispute
is essential for appointment of an arbitrator. A dispute
arises when a claim is asserted by one party and denied
by the other. The term “dispute” entails a positive element
and mere inaction to pay does not lead to the inference
that dispute exists. In that case, since the respondent
failed to finalise the bills due to the applicant, this Court
held that cause of action would be treated as arising not
from the date on which the payment became due, but on
the date when the applicant first wrote to the respondent
requesting finalisation of the bills. However, the Court also
expressly observed that ‘a party cannot postpone the
accrual of cause of action by writing reminders or sending
reminders’.
24. In the present case, the appellant has not disputed the
High Court's finding [Geo Miller & Co. v. Rajasthan Vidyut
RLW 429] that the appellant itself had handed over the
final bill to the respondent on 8-2-1983. Hence, the
holding in Inder Singh Rekhi [Inder Singh Rekhi v. DDA,
(1988) 2 SCC 338] will not apply, as in that case, the
applicant's claim was delayed on account of the
respondent's failure to finalise the bills. Therefore the right
to apply in the present case accrued from the date on
which the final bill was raised (see Union of India v. Momin
Construction Co. [Union of India v. Momin Construction
29. Moreover, in a commercial dispute, while mere failure
to pay may not give rise to a cause of action, once the
applicant has asserted their claim and the respondent fails
to respond to such claim, such failure will be treated as a
denial of the applicant's claim giving rise to a dispute, and
therefore the cause of action for reference to arbitration. It
does not lie to the applicant to plead that it waited for an
unreasonably long period to refer the dispute to arbitration
merely on account of the respondent's failure to settle
their claim and because they were writing representations
and reminders to the respondent in the meanwhile.”

15. The recent judgment of this Court in BSNL v. Nortel
Networks (India) (P) Ltd. [BSNL v. Nortel Networks (India) (P)
Ltd., (2021) 5 SCC 738] , delivered on 10-3-2021 in Civil Appeals
Nos. 843-844 of 2021 has also considered the entire law on the
subject. The first paragraph of the said judgment reads as
follows: (SCC p. 747, para 1)
“1. … The present appeals raise two important issues for
our consideration: (i) the period of limitation for filing an
application under Section 11 of the Arbitration and
Conciliation Act, 1996 (“the 1996 Act”); and (ii) whether
the Court may refuse to make the reference under Section
11 where the claims are ex facie time-barred?”
16. Insofar as the first issue is concerned, after examining Article
137 of the Limitation Act, this Court held: [Nortel Networks
(India) (P) Ltd. case [BSNL v. Nortel Networks (India) (P) Ltd.,
(2021) 5 SCC 738] , SCC pp. 751-52, paras 15-16]
“15. It is now fairly well settled that the limitation for filing
an application under Section 11 would arise upon the
failure to make the appointment of the arbitrator within a
period of 30 days from issuance of the notice invoking
arbitration. In other words, an application under Section
11 can be filed only after a notice of arbitration in respect
of the particular claim(s)/dispute(s) to be referred to
arbitration [as contemplated by Section 21 of the Act] is
made, and there is failure to make the appointment.*
16. The period of limitation for filing a petition seeking
appointment of an arbitrator(s) cannot be confused or
conflated with the period of limitation applicable to the
substantive claims made in the underlying commercial
contract. The period of limitation for such claims is
prescribed under various Articles of the Limitation Act,
1963. The limitation for deciding the underlying
substantive disputes is necessarily distinct from that of
filing an application for appointment of an arbitrator. This
position was recognised even under Section 20 of the
Arbitration Act, 1940. Reference may be made to the
judgment of this Court in J.C. Budhraja v. Orissa Mining
Corpn. Ltd. [J.C. Budhraja v. Orissa Mining Corpn. Ltd.,
(2008) 2 SCC 444 : (2008) 1 SCC (Civ) 582] wherein it
was held that Section 37(3) of the 1940 Act provides that
for the purpose of the Limitation Act, an arbitration is
deemed to have commenced when one party to the
arbitration agreement serves on the other party, a notice
requiring the appointment of an arbitrator. Para 26 of this
judgment reads as follows: (SCC p. 460)
‘26. Section 37(3) of the Act provides that for the
purpose of the Limitation Act, an arbitration is
deemed to have been commenced when one party
to the arbitration agreement serves on the other
party thereto, a notice requiring the appointment of
an arbitrator. Such a notice having been served on
4-6-1980, it has to be seen whether the claims were
in time as on that date. If the claims were barred on
4-6-1980, it follows that the claims had to be
rejected by the arbitrator on the ground that the
claims were barred by limitation. The said period
has nothing to do with the period of limitation for
filing a petition under Section 8(2) of the Act. Insofar
as a petition under Section 8(2) is concerned, the
cause of action would arise when the other party
fails to comply with the notice invoking arbitration.
Therefore, the period of limitation for filing a petition
under Section 8(2) seeking appointment of an
arbitrator cannot be confused with the period of
limitation for making a claim. The decisions of this
Court in Inder Singh Rekhi v. DDA [Inder Singh
Rekhi v. DDA, (1988) 2 SCC 338] , Panchu Gopal
Bose v. Port        of    Calcutta [Panchu        Gopal
Bose v. Port of Calcutta, (1993) 4 SCC 338]
and Utkal Commercial Corpn. v. Central Coal Fields
Ltd. [Utkal Commercial Corpn. v. Central Coal
Fields Ltd., (1999) 2 SCC 571] also make this
position clear.’”
17. Insofar as the second issue is concerned, this Court went
into the position prior to the Arbitration and Conciliation
(Amendment) Act, 2015 [“the 2015 Amendment”] together with
the change made by the introduction of Section 11(6-A) by the
2015 Amendment, stating: [Nortel Networks (India) (P) Ltd.
case [BSNL v. Nortel Networks (India) (P) Ltd., (2021) 5 SCC
738] , SCC pp. 759-61, paras 31-34]
“31. Sub-section (6-A) came up for consideration in Duro
Felguera S.A. v. Gangavaram Port Ltd. [Duro Felguera
S.A. v. Gangavaram Port Ltd., (2017) 9 SCC 729 : (2017)
4 SCC (Civ) 764] , wherein this Court held that the
legislative policy was to minimise judicial intervention at
the appointment stage. In an application under Section 11,
the Court should only look into the existence of the
arbitration agreement, before making the reference. Post
the 2015 Amendment, all that the courts are required to
examine is whether an arbitration agreement is in
existence — nothing more, nothing less: (SCC pp. 759 &
‘48. Section 11(6-A) added              by   the   2015
“11. (6-A) The Supreme Court or, as the case
may be, the High Court, while considering
any application under sub-section (4) or sub-
section      (5)    or     sub-section     (6),
shall, notwithstanding any judgment, decree
or order of any court, confine to the
examination of the existence of an arbitration
agreement.”
From a reading of Section 11(6-A), the intention of
the legislature is crystal clear i.e. the court should
and need only look into one aspect—the existence
of an arbitration agreement. What are the factors
for deciding as to whether there is an arbitration
agreement is the next question. The resolution to
that is simple—it needs to be seen if the
agreement contains a clause which provides for
arbitration pertaining to the disputes which have
arisen between the parties to the agreement.
59. The scope of the power under Section 11(6) of
the 1996 Act was considerably wide in view of the
decisions in SBP & Co. [SBP & Co. v. Patel Engg.
Ltd.,       (2005)     8   SCC     618]     and Boghara
Polyfab [National Insurance Co. Ltd. v. Boghara
(Civ) 117]. This position continued till the
amendment brought about in 2015. After the
amendment, all that the courts need to see is
whether an arbitration agreement exists—nothing
more, nothing less. The legislative policy and
purpose is essentially to minimise the Court's
intervention at the stage of appointing the arbitrator
and this intention as incorporated in Section 11(6-A)
ought to be respected.’
32. In Mayavati Trading (P) Ltd. v. Pradyuat Deb
Burman [Mayavati Trading (P) Ltd. v. Pradyuat Deb
Burman, (2019) 8 SCC 714 : (2019) 4 SCC (Civ) 441] , a
three-Judge Bench held that the scope of power of the
Court under Section 11 (6-A) had to be construed in the
narrow sense. In para 10, it was opined as under: (SCC
‘10. This being the position, it is clear that the law
prior to the 2015 Amendment that has been laid
down by this Court, which would have included
going into whether accord and satisfaction has
taken place, has now been legislatively overruled.
This being the position, it is difficult to agree with
the reasoning contained in the aforesaid judgment
[United India Insurance Co. Ltd. v. Antique Art
(Civ) 785] , as Section 11(6-A) is confined to the
examination of the existence of an arbitration
agreement and is to be understood in the narrow
sense as has been laid down in the judgment
in Duro         Felguera         S.A. [Duro      Felguera
S.A. v. Gangavaram Port Ltd., (2017) 9 SCC 729 :
Ltd. v. Northern Coal Field Ltd. [Uttarakhand Purv Sainik
Kalyan Nigam Ltd. v. Northern Coal Field Ltd., (2020) 2
SCC 455 : (2020) 1 SCC (Civ) 570] this Court took note of
the recommendations of the Law Commission in its 246th
Report, the relevant extract of which reads as: (SCC p.
‘7.6. The Law Commission in the 246th Report
[ Amendments to the Arbitration and Conciliation
Act, 1996, Report No. 246, Law Commission of
India (August 2014), p. 20.] recommended that:
“33. … the Commission has recommended
Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996. The
scope of the judicial intervention is only
restricted    to      situations    where    the
court/judicial authority finds that the
arbitration agreement does not exist or is null
and void. Insofar as the nature of intervention
is concerned, it is recommended that in the
event the court/judicial authority is prima
facie satisfied against the argument
challenging the arbitration agreement, it
*shall* appoint the arbitrator and/or refer the
parties to arbitration, as the case may be.
The amendment envisages that the judicial
authority shall not refer the parties to
arbitration only if it finds that there does not
exist an arbitration agreement or that it is null
and void. If the judicial authority is of the
opinion that prima facie the arbitration
agreement exists, then it shall refer the
dispute to arbitration, and leave the existence
of the arbitration agreement to be finally
determined by the Arbitral Tribunal.” ’
contained in the amended Section 11(6-A),
the Court is now required only to examine the
existence of the arbitration agreement. All
other preliminary or threshold issues are left
to be decided by the arbitrator under Section
16, which enshrines the kompetenz-
kompetenz-komptenz implies that the Arbitral
Tribunal is empowered, and has the
competence to rule on its own jurisdiction,
including determination of all jurisdictional
issues. This was intended to minimise judicial
intervention at the pre-reference stage, so
that the arbitral process is not thwarted at the
threshold when a preliminary objection is
raised by the parties.”
18. This Court went on to hold that limitation is not a
jurisdictional issue but is an admissibility issue. It then referred to
a recent judgment of this Court in Vidya Drolia v. Durga Trading
Corpn. [Vidya Drolia v. Durga Trading Corpn., (2021) 2 SCC 1 :
(2021) 1 SCC (Civ) 549] , and stated as follows: (Nortel
Networks case [BSNL v. Nortel Networks (India) (P) Ltd., (2021)
5 SCC 738] , SCC pp. 763-66, paras 45-47)
“45. In a recent judgment delivered by a three-Judge
Bench in Vidya Drolia v. Durga Trading Corpn. [Vidya
Drolia v. Durga Trading Corpn., (2021) 2 SCC 1 : (2021) 1
SCC (Civ) 549] , on the scope of power under Sections 8
and 11, it has been held that the Court must undertake a
primary first review to weed out ‘manifestly ex facie non-
existent and invalid arbitration agreements, or non-
arbitrable disputes’. The prima facie review at the
reference stage is to cut the deadwood, where dismissal
is barefaced and pellucid, and when on the facts and law,
the litigation must stop at the first stage. Only when the
Court is certain that no valid arbitration agreement exists,
or that the subject-matter is not arbitrable, that reference
may be refused.
45.1. In para 144, the Court observed that the judgment
in Mayavati Trading [Mayavati Trading (P) Ltd. v. Pradyuat
had rightly held that the judgment in Patel Engg. [SBP &
Co. v. Patel Engg. Ltd., (2005) 8 SCC 618] had been
legislatively overruled. Para 144 reads as: (Vidya Drolia
case [Vidya Drolia v. Durga Trading Corpn., (2021) 2 SCC
1 : (2021) 1 SCC (Civ) 549] , SCC pp. 114-15)
‘144. As observed earlier, Patel Engg. Ltd. [SBP &
Co. v. Patel Engg. Ltd., (2005) 8 SCC 618] explains
and holds that Sections 8 and 11 are
complementary in nature as both relate to reference
to arbitration. Section 8 applies when judicial
proceeding is pending and an application is filed for
stay of judicial proceeding and for reference to
arbitration. Amendments to Section 8 vide Act 3 of
2016 have not been omitted. Section 11 covers the
situation where the parties approach a court for
appointment of an arbitrator. Mayavati Trading (P)
Ltd. [Mayavati Trading (P) Ltd. v. Pradyuat Deb
441] , in our humble opinion, rightly holds that Patel
Engg. Ltd. [SBP & Co. v. Patel Engg. Ltd., (2005) 8
SCC 618] has been legislatively overruled and
hence would not apply even post omission of sub-
section (6-A) to Section 11 of the Arbitration
Ltd. v. Pradyuat Deb Burman, (2019) 8 SCC 714 :
(2019) 4 SCC (Civ) 441] has elaborated upon the
object and purposes and history of the amendment
to Section 11, with reference to sub-section (6-A) to
elucidate that the section, as originally enacted,
was facsimile with Article 11 of the UNCITRAL Model
of law of arbitration on which the Arbitration Act was
drafted and enacted.’
While exercising jurisdiction under Section 11 as the
judicial forum, the court may exercise the prima facie test
to screen and knockdown ex facie meritless, frivolous, and
dishonest litigation. Limited jurisdiction of the courts would
ensure expeditious and efficient disposal at the referral
stage. At the referral stage, the court can interfere “only”
when it is “manifest” that the claims are ex facie time-
barred and dead, or there is no subsisting dispute. Para
148 of the judgment reads as follows: (Vidya Drolia
case [Vidya Drolia v. Durga Trading Corpn., (2021) 2 SCC
1 : (2021) 1 SCC (Civ) 549] , SCC p. 119)
‘148. Section 43(1) of the Arbitration Act states that
the Limitation Act, 1963 shall apply to arbitrations
as it applies to court proceedings. Sub-section (2)
states that for the purposes of the Arbitration Act
and Limitation Act, arbitration shall be deemed to
have commenced on the date referred to in Section
21. Limitation law is procedural and normally
disputes, being factual, would be for the arbitrator
to decide guided by the facts found and the law
applicable. The court at the referral stage can
interfere only when it is manifest that the claims are
ex facie time-barred and dead, or there is no
subsisting dispute. All other cases should be
referred to the Arbitral Tribunal for decision on
merits. Similar would be the position in case of
disputed “no-claim certificate” or defence on the
plea of novation and “accord and satisfaction”. As
observed in Fili Shipping Co. Ltd. [Fili Shipping Co.
Ltd. v. Premium Nafta Products Ltd., 2007 Bus LR
1719 : 2007 UKHL 40] , it is not to be expected that
commercial men while entering transactions inter se
would knowingly create a system which would
require that the court should first decide whether
the contract should be rectified or avoided or
rescinded, as the case may be, and then if the
contract is held to be valid, it would require the
arbitrator to resolve the issues that have arisen.’
45.2. In para 154.4, it has been concluded that: (Vidya
Drolia case [Vidya Drolia v. Durga Trading Corpn., (2021)
2 SCC 1 : (2021) 1 SCC (Civ) 549] , SCC p. 121)
‘154.4. Rarely as a demurrer the court may interfere
at Section 8 or 11 stage when it is manifestly and
ex facie certain that the arbitration agreement is
non-existent, invalid or the disputes are non-
arbitrable, though the nature and facet of non-
arbitrability would, to some extent, determine the
level and nature of judicial scrutiny. The restricted
and limited review is to check and protect parties
from being forced to arbitrate when the matter is
demonstrably “non-arbitrable” and to cut off the
deadwood. The court by default would refer the
matter when contentions relating to non-arbitrability
are plainly arguable; when consideration in
summary proceedings would be insufficient and
inconclusive; when facts are contested; when the
party opposing arbitration adopts delaying tactics or
impairs conduct of arbitration proceedings. This is
not the stage for the court to enter into a mini trial or
elaborate review so as to usurp the jurisdiction of
the Arbitral Tribunal but to affirm and uphold
integrity and efficacy of arbitration as an alternative
dispute resolution mechanism.’
45.3. In para 244.4 it was concluded that: (Vidya Drolia
case [Vidya Drolia v. Durga Trading Corpn., (2021) 2 SCC
1 : (2021) 1 SCC (Civ) 549] , SCC p. 162)
‘244.4. The court should refer a matter if the validity
of the arbitration agreement cannot be determined
on a prima facie basis, as laid down above
i.e. “when in doubt, do refer”.’
46. The upshot of the judgment in Vidya Drolia [Vidya
Drolia v. Durga Trading Corpn., (2021) 2 SCC 1 : (2021) 1
SCC (Civ) 549] is affirmation of the position of law
expounded             in Duro    Felguera [Duro       Felguera
S.A. v. Gangavaram Port Ltd., (2017) 9 SCC 729 : (2017)
4 SCC (Civ) 764] and Mayavati Trading [Mayavati Trading
(P) Ltd. v. Pradyuat Deb Burman, (2019) 8 SCC 714 :
(2019) 4 SCC (Civ) 441] , which continue to hold the field.
It must be understood clearly that Vidya Drolia [Vidya
Drolia v. Durga Trading Corpn., (2021) 2 SCC 1 : (2021) 1
SCC (Civ) 549] has not resurrected the pre-amendment
position on the scope of power as held in SBP &
Co. v. Patel Engg. Ltd. [SBP & Co. v. Patel Engg. Ltd.,
47. It is only in the very limited category of cases, where
there is not even a vestige of doubt that the claim is ex
facie time-barred, or that the dispute is non-arbitrable, that
the court may decline to make the reference. However, if
there is even the slightest doubt, the rule is to refer the
disputes to arbitration, otherwise it would encroach upon
what is essentially a matter to be determined by the
tribunal.”
On the basis of the aforesaid analysis, the Supreme Court
recorded its conclusion in paragraph 19 which reads as follows:-
“19. Applying the aforesaid judgments to the facts of this case,
so far as the applicability of Article 137 of the Limitation Act to
the applications under Section 11 of the Arbitration Act is
concerned, it is clear that the demand for arbitration in the
present case was made by the letter dated 7-11-2006. This
demand was reiterated by a letter dated 13-1-2007, which letter
itself informed the appellant that appointment of an arbitrator
would have to be made within 30 days. At the very latest,
therefore, on the facts of this case, time began to run on and
from 12-2-2007. The appellant's laconic letter dated 23-1-2007,
which stated that the matter was under consideration, was within
the 30-day period. On and from 12-2-2007, when no arbitrator
was appointed, the cause of action for appointment of an
arbitrator accrued to the respondent and time began running
from that day. Obviously, once time has started running, any final
rejection by the appellant by its letter dated 10-11-2010 would
not give any fresh start to a limitation period which has already
begun running, following the mandate of Section 9 of the
Limitation Act. This being the case, the High Court was clearly in
error in stating that since the applications under Section 11 of
the Arbitration Act were filed on 6-11-2013, they were within the
limitation period of three years starting from 10-11-2020. On this
count, the applications under Section 11 of the Arbitration Act,
themselves being hopelessly time-barred, no arbitrator could
have been appointed by the High Court.”
In view of the aforesaid law laid down by the Supreme Court, it is
evident that in the present case the dispute between the parties arose in the
year 2007, whereafter the applicant for the first time sent a legal notice to the
respondents for the appointment of an arbitrator on 11.04.2011, whereupon the
respondents responded by their letter dated 28.04.2011 asking the applicant to
deposit the necessary 10% of the claim amount failing which it would be
responsible for the delay and, therefore, deserves to be dismissed, as evidently,
the limitation as far as filing of the application under Section 11 of the Act is
concerned would start running from that date and, therefore, the present
application filed by the applicant before this Court on 28.04.2017 is apparently
delayed and barred by limitation, as it has been filed well beyond three years,
in view of the law laid down by the Supreme Court in Secunderabad
Cantonment Board’s as well as Bharat Sanchar Nigam Ltd.’s cases (supra).
The application, accordingly, stands dismissed.
