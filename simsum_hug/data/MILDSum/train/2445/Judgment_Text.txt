1.     This appeal challenges the order dated 25.03.2022 passed by the High Court of
Judicature for the State of Telangana at Hyderabad by which the Habeas Corpus Writ
Petition bearing No. 35519 of 2021 of the petitionerwife challenging the order of
prevention of detention of her husband has been dismissed.
2.     The brief facts of the case are that the prevention detention order was passed
against the husband of the petitioner on 28th October, 2021 by the Commissioner of
Police, Rachakonda Commissionerate on grounds that the detenu was involved in gold
chain snatching offences, where victims were mostly women. He has been doing this
since the year 2020 in the States of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana. He was involved in
as many as 36 gold chain snatching offences. Earlier, the detenu, along with three others,
had formed a gang to commit these offences in order to make quick money. It was
alleged that they had come to Hyderabad in a car bearing No. AP 39 TU 5033 and took
shelter in a lodge. Their modus operandi was to first conduct recce of some residential
areas and after selecting a suitable residential area, lift two wheelers and motor cycles
which were then used in the chain snatching offences. Although according to the
Authority the detenu was involved in more than 30 cases but only 4 cases of chain
snatching were considered as ground for detention, as the other cases were reported to
be behind the proximity period and out of the jurisdiction of Commissionerate. The four
cases on which reliance has been placed are as under:
“(1) Crime No. 355 of 2021 for the offences under Sections 392, 411 read with 34 IPC of Medipally
(2) Crime No. 358 of 2021 for the offences under Sections 392, 411 read with 34 IPC of Medipally
(3) Crime No. 532 of 2021 for the offence under Section 392 read with 34 IPC of Medipally Police
(4) Crime No. 533 of 2021 for the offences under Sections 392, 411 read with 34 IPC of Medipally
3.      In short, against the detenu the F.I.Rs primarily an offence of ‘robbery’ under
section 392 of the Indian Penal Code. The detention order also says that the crimes were
committed in broad day light and have thus resulted in creation of fear and panic in the
minds of the general public, especially women and hence, the Government had to
interfere in order to “maintain public order”.
4.      The said four cases were allegedly committed by the detenu within a span of two
months between 06.05.2021 to 26.07.2021 and were committed within the jurisdiction of
one police station i.e., Medipalli police station. In all these cases, the detenu had moved
bail applications before the concerned Metropolitan Magistrate and was granted bail
under Section 167 (2) Cr.P.C, which is commonly known as ‘default bail’ and the detenu
was released on 16.10.2021. The detention order was later passed on 28.10.2021, which
was subsequently confirmed by the Advisory Council on 13.01.2022, i.e., within the
stipulated time. The detenu is under detention since 28.10.2021.
5.      The Preventive Detention Law, under which the powers have been exercised is a
long winded statute called the “Telangana Prevention of Dangerous Activities of Boot-
Arms Offenders, Cyber Crime Offenders and White Collar or Financial Offenders Act,
1986”(hereinafter referred to as `the Act’). Powers have been exercised under Section 3
“3. (1) The Government may, if satisfied with respect to any boot-legger, dacoit, drugoffender,
goonda, immoral traffic offender [Land-Grabber, Spurious Seed Offender, Insecticide Offender,
Arms Offender, Cyber Crime Offender and White Collar or Financial Offender] that with a view to
preventing him from acting in any manner prejudicial to the maintenance of public order, it is
necessary so to do, make an order directing that such person be detained.
(2) If, having regard to the circumstances prevailing or likely to prevail in any area within the local
limits of the jurisdiction of a District Magistrate or a Commissioner of Police, the Government are
satisfied that it is necessary so to do, they may, by order in writing, direct that during such period as
may be specified in the order, such District Magistrate or Commissioner of Police may also, if
satisfied as provided in sub-section (1), exercise the powers conferred by the said subsection:
Provided that the period specified in the order made by the Government under this sub-section shall
not in the first instance, exceed three months, but the Government may, if satisfied as aforesaid that
it is necessary so to do, amend such order to extend such period from time to time by any period
not exceeding three months at any one time.
(3) When any order is made under this section by an officer mentioned in sub-section (2), he
shall forthwith report the fact to the Government together with the grounds on which the order has
been made and such other particulars as in his opinion, have a bearing on the matter, and no such
order shall remain in force for more than twelve days after the making thereof, unless, in the mean
time, it has been approved by the Government.”
6.      The powers have been exercised in the present case under section 3(1) of the Act.
Under the aforesaid provision, inter alia, a detention order can be passed against a
“goonda”. A “goonda” has been defined under Section 2 (g) of the Act, which reads as
“2. g) “goonda” means a person, who either by himself or as a member of or leader of a gang,
habitually commits, or attempts to commit or abets the commission of offences punishable under
Chapter XVI or Chapter XVII or Chapter XXII of the Indian Penal Code;
7.      Since the allegation is that the detenu is involved in four cases of chain snatching
i.e., robbery, which comes under offences given under Chapter XVII of the Indian Penal
Code, he has been declared a habitual offender and thus a “goonda” vide the detention
order dated 28.10.2021.
8.      Now under section 3(1) of the Act, detention order can be passed, inter alia, against
a “goonda”, “with a view to prevent him from acting in any manner prejudicial to the
maintenance of public order…”. Due to the detenu’s alleged involvement in four criminal
cases relating to “robbery” he has been declared a “goonda” and it is said that this is
acting in a manner which is “prejudicial to the maintenance of public order”.
9.      A bare reading of the aforesaid provision shows that the “maintenance of public
order” has a crucial bearing here and unless the Government is justified in holding that
the act of the detenu is prejudicial to the maintenance of public order, the preventive
detention would be bad and would be in violation of Articles 21 and 22 of the Constitution
of India as it encroaches upon the liberty and freedom of an individual.
10.     The detention order was challenged by the wife of the detenu in a Habeas Corpus
petition before the Division Bench of the Telangana High Court. The ground taken by the
petitioner before the High Court was that reliance has been taken by the Authority of four
cases of chain snatching, as already mentioned above. The admitted position is that in
all these four cases the detenu has been released on bail by the Magistrate. Moreover,
in any case, the nature of crime as alleged against the petitioner can at best be said to
be a law and order situation and not the public order situation, which would have justified
invoking the powers under the Preventive Detention Law. This, however did not find
favour with the Division Bench of the High Court, which dismissed the petition, upholding
the validity of the detention order.
11.     Shri Rahul Gupta, learned counsel for the Petitioner before this Court has confined
his arguments on two aspects. Firstly, the detenu is allegedly involved in four criminal
cases where he has been granted bail, and that too has been granted as the prosecution,
in all four cases, failed to file its charge sheet in time. Now they cannot resort to the law
of Preventive Detention. Secondly, even assuming the allegations of the prosecution to
be correct, then too it only reflects a “law and order” problem and not a “public order”
problem as mentioned under the Act.
12.     There is absolutely no doubt in our mind that the facts and circumstances of the
case as alleged in the detention order dated 28.10.2021 though does reflect a law and
order situation which can be dealt with under the ordinary law of land, and there was
absolutely no occasion for invoking the extraordinary powers under the law of Preventive
Detention. The reasons assigned by the authority in its detention, justifying the invocation
of the provisions of the detention law are that the detenu has been granted bail in all the
four cases and since he is likely to indulge in similar crime, hence the order of preventive
13.     The reason why bail was granted in all four cases, however, has not been given.
Bail was granted in all the four cases due to the inability of the prosecution, which did not
complete its investigation in time. The bail had to be given as the charge sheet was not
filed by the police in all the cases within the stipulated period of 60 days. The fault thus
lies with the prosecution.
14.     The other reason assigned is that the Trial Court while granting bail did not lay
down any conditions. This is again a wrong presentation of the case. Conditions were
not imposed simply as it was a default bail, and in bail of this nature conditions are not
liable to be imposed.
15.     Having heard the learned counsel for the petitioner and learned counsel for the
State of Telangana, we are of the considered view that in the present case invocation of
the Preventive Detention Law against the petitioner was not justified. The powers to be
exercised under the Preventive Detention Law are exceptional powers which have been
given to the Government for its exercise in an exceptional situation as it strikes hard on
the freedom and liberty of an individual, and thus cannot be exercised in a routine
manner. The distinction between law and order situation and a public order situation has
been dealt with by the Supreme Court in a catena of decisions. In the case of Ram
Manohar Lohia Vs. State of Bihar, it has been held as under:
51. “We have here a case of detention under Rule 30 of the Defence of India Rules which permits
apprehension and detention of a person likely to act in a manner prejudicial to the maintenance of
public order. It follows that if such a person is not detained public disorder is the apprehended result.
Disorder is no doubt prevented by the maintenance of law and order also but disorder is a broad
spectrum which includes at one end small disturbances and at the other the most serious and
cataclysmic happenings. Does the expression “public order” take in every kind of disorders or only
some of them? The answer to this serves to distinguish “public order” from “law and order” because
the latter undoubtedly takes in all of them. Public order if disturbed, must lead to public disorder.
Every breach of the peace does not lead to public disorder. When two drunkards quarrel and fight
there is disorder but not public disorder. They can be dealt with under the powers to maintain law
and order but cannot be detained on the ground that they were disturbing public order. Suppose
that the two fighters were of rival communities and one of them tried to raise communal passions.
The problem is still one of law and order but it raises the apprehension of public disorder. Other
examples can be imagined. The contravention of law always affects order but before if can be said
to affect public order, it must affect the community or the public at large. A mere disturbance of law
and order leading to disorder is thus not necessarily sufficient for action under the Defence of India
Act but disturbances which subvert the public order are. A District Magistrate is entitled to take action
under Rule 30(1) (b) to prevent subversion of public order but not in aid of maintenance of law and
order under ordinary circumstances.
52 .It will thus appear that just as “public order” in the rulings of this Court (earlier cited) was said to
comprehend disorders of less gravity than those affecting “security of State”, “law and order” also
comprehends disorders of less gravity than those affecting “public order”. One has to imagine three
concentric circles. Law and order represents the largest circle within which is the next circle
representing public order and the smallest circle represents security of State. It is then easy to see
that an act may affect law and order but not public order just as an act may affect public order but
not security of the State. By using the expression “maintenance of law and order” the District
Magistrate was widening his own field of action and was adding a clause to the Defence of India
16.     In two recent decisions1, this Court had set aside the detention orders which were
passed, under the same Act, i.e., the present Telangana Act, primarily relying upon the
decision in Dr. Ram Manohar Lohia case (supra) and holding that the detention orders
were not justified as it was dealing with a law and order situation and not a public order
17.     In any case, the State is not without a remedy, as in case the detenu is much a
menace to the society as is being alleged, then the prosecution should seek for the
cancellation of his bail and/or move an appeal to the Higher Court. But definitely seeking
shelter under the preventive detention law is not the proper remedy under the facts and
circumstances of the case.
18.     In fact, in a recent decision of this Court, the Court had to make an observation
regarding the routine and unjustified use of the Preventive Detention Law in the State of
Telangana. This has been done in the case of Mallada K. Sri Ram Vs. The State of
Telangana & Ors. 2022 6 SCALE 50, it was stated as under :
“17.It is also relevant to note, that in the last five years, this Court has quashed over five detention
orders under the Telangana Act of 1986 for inter alia incorrectly applying the standard for
maintenance of public orderand relying on stale materials while passing the orders of detention. At
least ten detention orders under the Telangana Act of 1986 have been set aside by the High Court
of Telangana in the last one year itself. These numbers evince a callous exercise of the exceptional
power of preventive detention by the detaining authorities and the respondent-state. We direct the
respondents to take stock of challenges to detention orders pending before the Advisory Board,
High Court and Supreme Court and evaluate the fairness of the detention order against lawful
1 1 Banka Sneha Sheela Vs. State of Telangana (Crl.A.No.733/202; Mallada K. Sri Ram Vs.
State of Telangana (Crl.A. No. 561/2021)
19.    In view of the above, the appeal stands allowed. The order of detention dated
28.10.2021 and order dated 25.03.2022 of the Division Bench of the High Court of
Telangana are set aside. The detenu shall be released forthwith, in case he is not
required in any other case.
1.     This appeal challenges the order dated 25.03.2022 passed by the High Court of
Judicature for the State of Telangana at Hyderabad by which the Habeas Corpus Writ
Petition bearing No. 35523 of 2021 of the petitionerwife challenging the order of
prevention of detention of her husband has been dismissed.

(4) Crime No. 533 of 2021 for the offences under Sections 392, 411 read with 34 IPC of Medipally
3.     In short, against the detenu the F.I.Rs primarily an offence of ‘robbery’ under
section 392 of the Indian Penal Code. The detention order also says that the crimes were
