for the petitioners in all the petitions.
By this common order, the above-captioned revision petitions
are being disposed off.
The present revision petitions have been filed under Article 227
of the Constitution of India for setting aside the orders dated 23.02.2022
I attest to the accuracy and
authenticity of this order/judgment
CR No.1394 of 2022                                                     -2-
(Annexures P-4 and P-5) whereby evidence of the petitioners has been
closed by order and order dated 23.02.022 whereby the application filed by
the petitioners for summoning the official witnesses has been dismissed and
further for setting aside the order dated 05.04.2022 (Annexure P-8) passed
by the Labour Court, Panipat vide which the application dated 16.03.2022
(Annexure P-6) for recalling the orders dated 23.02.2022 has been
dismissed.
Learned counsel for the petitioners would contend that the
petitioners in the present case are Mali/Beldar, who were appointed by the
respondent-Management in the year 2000. They worked continuously upto
31.07.2018. However, their services were terminated on 01.08.2018. It is
further the contention of learned counsel for the petitioners that services of
the petitioners have been terminated in an arbitrary and illegal manner after
they had worked for a period of more than 19 years. Learned counsel for the
petitioners would further contend that the petitioners have no record with
them and moved an application for production of the service record as well
as the seniority list of daily wagers maintained by the respondent-
Management. However, without considering the said application, the
evidence of the petitioners was directed to be closed vide order dated
23.02.2022. Learned counsel for the petitioners would further contend that
the petitioners would lead their evidence if one opportunity is granted to
them and that their application for summoning the official witnesses along
with the record be considered on merits.

CR No.1394 of 2022                                                       -3-
Per contra, learned State counsel vehemently contended that
despite numerous opportunities the petitioners did not lead their evidence. It
is further the contention that the order closing the evidence of the petitioners
was passed on 23.02.2022 and the present petition was filed in April, 2022.
I have heard learned counsel for the parties.
In the present case the petitioners, who are Mali/Beldar, had
filed an application on 09.02.2022 for summoning the official witnesses
along with the record. However, without considering the said application the
evidence of the petitioners was closed vide order dated 23.02.2022.
Thereafter, the application for summoning the official witnesses was also
dismissed as having been rendered infructuous on the same very day vide a
separate order dated 23.02.2022. An application was thereafter moved by the
petitioners for recall of the orders dated 23.02.2022. However, the said
application was also dismissed vide the impugned order dated 05.04.2022.
The petitioners, who are Mali/Beldar, had been working as
daily wagers and have alleged that they have no record qua their service and
are unable to lead any evidence in the absence of the record being produced
by the respondent-Management. Though the application for summoning of
the official witnesses was filed on 09.02.2022, however, without considering
the same the order closing the evidence of the petitioners was passed on
23.02.2022. The petitioners, who are daily wagers and litigating for their
rights, would suffer irreparable loss and injury in case they are not allowed
to lead their evidence.

In view of the above and to do the complete justice between the
parties, the impugned orders are set aside. The petitioners shall be granted
one opportunity to lead their evidence. The Court, before granting them an
opportunity to lead their evidence, shall consider the application filed by
them for summoning of the official witnesses along with the record in
accordance with the law.
The revision petitions stand disposed off in the above terms.
Pending applications, if any, also stand disposed off.
