The Allahabad High Court on Monday granted bail to one Fuzail who has been accused of selling sugarcane juice which was adulterated with beef.
 The bench of Justice Deepak Verma granted him bail keeping in view the nature of offence, evidence, and complicity of the accused and the law laid down by the Apex Court in the case of Satender Kumar Antil vs Central Bureau Of Investigation |  (SC) 577.
 Accused Fuzail, booked under Sections 323, 504, 295-A I.P.C. and Section 3, 5 of U.P. Prevention of Cow Slaughter Act, 1955, had moved the High Court seeking bail on the ground that he is innocent and has been falsely implicated in the case due to ulterior motive.
 It was submitted by his counsel Hasan Parvez that the accused is engaged in selling sugarcane juice and he was implicated in the case by the informant making a concocted story after a dispute arose between the parties regarding the payment of money. 
 It was also argued that there is no FSL report of the alleged incident, which may prove the prosecution story, hence, no offence under the alleged sections is made out and he is languishing in jail since November 30, 2022. 
 Against this backdrop, noting that the accused had made a case for bail, the Court granted him relief on his furnishing a personal bond and two sureties each in the like amount to the satisfaction of the court concerned.
