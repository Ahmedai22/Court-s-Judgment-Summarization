This petition is directed against the order dated 13.04.2022
passed by the Additional District Judge, Court No. 5/Special Judge
(U.P. Gangsters and Anti-social Activities (Prevention) Act, 1986)
Muzaffarnagar, dismissing Civil Revision No. 18 of 2022 and
affirming an order dated 07.03.2022 passed by the Civil Judge
(Senior Division) Fast Track Court, Muzaffarnagar in Original Suit
No. 372 of 2013, rejecting the petitioner’s application 85C seeking
to recall orders dated 26.10.2021 and 14.12.2021.
2.    By    the   order   dated   26.10.2021,    an   application   for
adjournment by the defendant has been rejected and his
opportunity to cross-examine P.W.1 closed. The suit was directed
to come up for arguments. By the order dated 14.12.2021, in the
absence of the defendant, the suit was directed to come up for
arguments ex-parte on 03.01.2022. A perusal of the record shows
that Original Suit No. 372 of 2013 was filed by Vipul Mittal against
Yogendra Kumar Garg before the Court of the Civil Judge (Senior
Division), Muzaffarnagar for partition of his half share in House No.
212/1, situate at Mohalla Civil Lines, West, Muzaffarnagar, detailed
in Schedule A to the plaint. The plaintiff sought a decree in terms
that after the determination of his share, the suit property be
partitioned by metes and bounds and separate possession
delivered to him. A decree for permanent injunction was also
sought to the effect that the defendants, prior to the partition being
effected, may not mortgage the suit property or alter the nature and
character of the house in dispute. The original defendant to the
suit, Yogendra Kumar Garg, appears to have passed away pending
suit and was substituted by his heirs and L.Rs., numbering five,
and arrayed as defendant nos. 1/1 to 1/5 to the suit. The suit is one
of the year 2013. The suit has proceeded to trial and it appears that
the plaintiff had filed his evidence on affidavit and 16.10.2021 was
the date scheduled for cross-examination of P.W.1. On the said
date, the Counsel for the defendant made an application for
adjournment, which was opposed by the plaintiff. The application
for adjournment was rejected and opportunity to cross-examine
P.W.1 was closed. The suit was directed to come up for arguments
on 09.11.2021. On 09.11.2021, 17.11.2021 and 01.12.2021, the
suit was adjourned eventlessly. It was adjourned on 09.11.2021
because the Presiding Officer was on leave, but the parties were
also absent. On 17.11.2021, it was adjourned because the learned
Members of the Bar had abstained from judicial work. Again, on
01.12.2021, the case was adjourned because the Presiding Officer
was on leave. On 01.12.2021, it was adjourned to 14.12.2021. On
14.12.2021, when the suit came up for arguments, the Counsel for
the plaintiff was present, but no one appeared on behalf of the
defendant. It was in those circumstances that the Trial Court
directed that the suit may come up for arguments ex-parte on
03.01.2022. In the said order, it was recorded that the Bar
Association has proposed no work from 17.12.2021, due to
elections of the Bar.
3.     By the application dated 04.01.2022, the defendant has
sought recall of the order dated 14.12.2021 that directs the suit to
come up for address of arguments ex-parte. This application bears
Paper No. 85C. By the other application dated 07.03.2022, the
defendant has sought recall of the order dated 26.10.2021 that has
closed the defendant’s opportunity to cross-examine P.W.1 and
once again asked for recall of the order dated 14.12.2021, setting
down the suit for address of arguments ex-parte. It is these
applications that the Trial Judge has rejected vide his order dated
4.     Heard Mr. Anil Kumar Aditya, learned Counsel for the
petitioner in support of the motion to admit this petition to hearing
and Ms. Shreya Gupta, learned Counsel appearing for the plaintiff-
respondents at length. The records have been carefully perused.
5.     The impugned order passed by the Trial Judge shows that he
has rejected the Application 85C seeking recall of the order dated
14.12.2021 alone, that is to say, the application dated 04.01.2022
on the ground that there is no order dated 14.12.2021. That remark
or reason to reject by the Trial Court is not borne out from the
record. There is definitely an order dated 14.12.2021 passed by the
Trial Court, directing the suit to come up for address of arguments
ex-parte. So far as the other application is concerned, the Trial
Court has dismissed it on the ground that the order dated
14.12.2021 is non-existent and the order dated 26.10.2021 ought
not to be recalled, because the defendant is merely trying to delay
the trial. It has also been remarked that the Application 85C (the
application dated 07.03.2022 that seeks recall of both orders dated
26.10.2021 and 14.12.2021) is not supported by an affidavit. It is
for the reason that Application 89C has been rejected. The
Revisional Court has upheld the orders impugned on the ground
Matters under Art. 227 No. 3265 of 2022
that both the applications 85C and 89C have been made much
beyond limitation, without an application or prayer for condonation
of delay; but, this is one facet of the reasoning that the Revisional
Court has adopted. The Revisional Court has looked wholesomely
into the record to arrive at a conclusion that the defendant is
attempting to delay trial of the suit, which has been expedited
under orders of this Court dated 14.09.2018 passed in some
supervisory proceedings. It appears that there is some order of this
Court, directing the suit to be decided within two years and that
schedule was violated because of the dilatory tactics adopted by
the defendant. It is bearing all these facts in mind that the
Revisional Court has declined to interfere with the orders made by
the learned Trial Judge.
6.    This Court has carefully looked into the order-sheet. It must
be remarked that indeed, there have been determined efforts to
delay trial of the suit. On 08.01.2021, the plaintiff’s evidence on
affidavit was accepted and the suit was scheduled for cross-
examination     of   P.W.on    28.01.2021.   From        28.01.2021              to
26.10.2021, 18 dates were fixed prior to 26.10.2021, but for one
reason or the other, the defendant did not cross examine P.W.1.
The Trial Judge in between 28.01.2021 and 26.10.2021 has taken
note of the orders of this Court in the order recorded on
02.08.2021, saying that the High Court has issued directions for
concluding the trial within two years, and further, that the suit has
been assigned to him by the District Judge. It is not that the order
dated 26.10.2021, closing the defendant’s opportunity has been
passed surreptitiously or suddenly. The defendant has been given
enough opportunity by the orders passed by the Trial Court on
earlier dates, and also, by all those ominous resolutions of the Bar,
directing its members to abstain from judicial work. It must be
Matters under Art. 227 No. 3265 of 2022
remarked that Resolutions of the Bar, asking its Members to
abstain from judicial work, are absolutely unlawful, in view of the
directions of the Supreme Court in Ex-Capt. Harish Uppal v.
Union of India and another 1, Common Cause, a registered
society and others v. Union of India and others 2, Krishnakant
Tamrakar v. State of Madhya Pradesh, (2018) 17 SCC 27 3 and
District Bar Association, Dehradun through its Secretary v.
Ishwar Shandilya and others4. Such resolutions being per se
illegal, no litigant can derive any advantage out of these. The
orders passed on 01.09.2021, 13.09.2021, 14.09.2021, 08.10.2021
and 26.10.2021 must be taken particular note of, as these
immediately preceded the order dated 26.10.2021 passed by the
learned Trial Judge. These orders are extracted below :
Called out.
Counsel on behalf of the df. Present and filed
adjournment 82D stating that O.S. 982/10 is a connected
case and is pending in the Court of Civil Judge S.D. df.
are trying to get the connected case transferred to one
Court. Hence adjournment is moved.
Application allowed in interest of justice.
Put up on 13-09-2021.
Proposal of Bar to abstain from judicial work.
Hon’ble H.C. has pass direction to dispose off the
case within 2 years. Even on repeated requests to the
counsels, no sides are appearing.
In the interest of justice, last opportunity is
granted to parties. Put up on 24-09-2021.
7.     This Court takes particular notice of the order dated
13.09.2021, where the learned Trial Judge has observed that the
High Court has directed the suit to be decided within two years, but
despite repeated requests to the learned Counsel, no one is
appearing. This was so because the Bar had abstained from
judicial work. This conduct of the Bar is not only reprehensible, but
also downright illegal. The Bar Association is, after all, a registered
society and cannot hold up the functioning of a Sovereign Court by
their resolutions. Whatever they do, they do it at the peril of the
litigants whose interest their Members represent. If the learned
Counsel refuse to appear and so do the parties, the Court is
supposed to pass orders in accordance with the Code of Civil
Procedure, 1908 that provides for orders to be made when parties,
both or one, are absent. The impugned order passed on
26.10.2021, which follows the order dated 10.10.2021 recorded
hereinabove, reads :
Counsel of Df. filed an adjournment 84D which is
strongly opposed by pf.
On perusal it is observed that df. is continuously
delaying the case by not turning up. In the light of
conduct of df., opportunity to cross examine PW1 is
closed. Adjournment rejected.
8.     The other order of which recall was sought is the one dated
14.12.2021. It reads :
Put up on 03-01-2022 for ex-parte arguments,
as BAR proposed no work from 17-12-2021 due to
elections of BAR.
9.     Again on 14.12.2021, the Members of the Bar abstained from
judicial work, because Bar Elections were going on. It is beyond
imagination that the work of a Court would be brought to a grinding
halt, because the elections of a registered society are to be held.
No doubt, learned Members of the Bar are superior officers of the
Court, but the Bar Association is no more than a registered society
established for the welfare of the learned Members of the Bar and
to positively contribute to the functioning of its individual Members.
The Bar Association is not established to obstruct functioning of the
Court and interfere with the discharge of its sovereign functions.
The Trial Court was, therefore, absolutely right when it made the
order dated 14.12.2021, directing the suit to come up for address
of arguments ex-parte.
10.    It must be noted that on 14.12.2021, learned Counsel for the
plaintiff was present. Had the learned Counsel for the plaintiff not
been present on 14.12.2021, the Trial Court would have dismissed
the suit in default also. But, it was the defendant’s Counsel alone
who was absent and not the plaintiff. The order dated 14.12.2021,
Matters under Art. 227 No. 3265 of 2022
like the order dated 26.10.2021, is unexceptionable. It must be
noted that on 26.10.2021 also, the plaintiff, along with his Counsel,
was present. The Revisional Court has upheld the order on the
ground of limitation, besides taking the conduct of the defendant
into account, though not eloquently said in the order impugned
passed by the learned Additional District Judge.
11.   For the added reasons mentioned, this Court concurs in the
conclusion reached by the two Courts below unanimously.
12.   In the result, this petition fails and stands dismissed.
13.   There shall, however, be no order as to costs.
14.   The Registrar General is directed to circulate this order to all
the learned District Judges, the Presiding Officers of Land
Acquisition,   Rehabilitation     and      Resettlement         Tribunals,           the
Principal Judges of Family Courts, the Presiding Officers of Motor
Accident Claim Tribunals and the Chairman, Board of Revenue.
