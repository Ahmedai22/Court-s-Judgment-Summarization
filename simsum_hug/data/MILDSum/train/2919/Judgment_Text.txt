The applicant has filed this third bail application u/S.439 Cr.P.C.
for grant of bail. Applicant has been arrested on 19.06.2021 by Police
Station Physical, District Shivpuri (M.P.) in connection with Crime
No.133/2021 for the offence punishable under Sections 8, 21 NDPS
It is the submission of learned counsel for the applicant that the
applicant is suffering confinement since 19.06.2021 and charge-sheet
has been filed. As alleged, applicant found in possession 14 grams of
smack when he was moving alongwith other co-accused Chatur Singh
Kushwaha. Although criminal record of six cases haunt the applicant
but they are minor in nature therefore, a chance may be given to him
for course correction and to mend his ways and become a better
citizen. It is further submitted that applicant undertakes to cooperate in
trial and would abide by the terms and conditions as imposed by this
Court. It is also submitted that initially in the case in hand, when case
diary received, no criminal case was found to be existed against the
applicant but counsel for the applicant fairly mentioned in his bail
application that applicant has some criminal history and admitted the
said fact. He undertakes to perform community service to purge his
misdeeds,     if  any,   by   way     of   plantation   and    to   serve
national/environmental/social cause. On these grounds, he prayed for
Counsel for the respondent/State at the outset fairly submits that
when earlier bail was dismissed vide order dated 02.09.2021 passed in
MCRC.No.43300/2021, then case dairy was having list of criminal
cases of applicant and therefore, on the basis of his criminal record,
bail application was dismissed. When case dairy came again for this
bail application, then at that point of time, no criminal history was
available and it appears that applicant does not bear any criminal
record but since ealier order contained reference of criminal history
therefore, as per direction of this Court, affidavit of SHO, Police
Station Physical, Shivpuri has been filed.
Counsel for the State further referred the contents of affidavit in
which course of events have been mentioned and it has been
specifically stated that SHO, Police Station Physical had no lapse on
his part. In fact, wireless message regarding no criminal history of
applicant was sent by Constable- Lokendra Singh-Batch No.660 who is
posted at Police Station Karera and it was his duty to give correct
details of criminal record of applicant because all six cases were
registered at Police Station Karera. Since Constable did not state the
correct facts and on wireless reply referred the fact that applicant does
not bear any criminal record, therefore, believing the same, SHO,
Police Station Physical referred the fact about the applicant as man of
no criminal background. SHO, Police Station Physical tenders apology
for his mistake and submits that next time he will improve upon the
system and would not repeat the lapse in future.
Heard learned counsel for the parties and perused the documents
appended thereto.

19.06.2021 and he has criminal record for minor offences therefore, a
chance be given to the applicant to reform himself and for course
correction. Although, this Court intends to allow the bail application

Constable- Lokendra Singh-Batch No.660, Police Station Karera and
thereafter, ensure appropriate action if any officer including the
constable is found guilty of the misconduct.
A copy be given to the Superintendent of Police, Shivpuri for
information and compliance.
