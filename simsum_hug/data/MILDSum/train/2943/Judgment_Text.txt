Opposite Party :- State of U.P. and Another
Counsel for Applicant :- Prem Shankar,Abhijeet
Counsel for Opposite Party :- G.A.
Heard learned counsel for the applicant, learned AGA for
the State and perused the record.
This application under Section 482 CrPC has been filed
by the applicant Durga Datt Tripathi with the prayer to
quash the charge-sheet no. 03 of 2020, dated 15.09.2020
and cognizance order dated 03.01.2019 as well as entire
proceedings of Criminal Case No. 26 of 2019 (State Vs.
Sanjeev Saxena and others), arising out of Case Crime
No. 74 of 1997, under Sections 409, 420, 465, 468, 471,
120-B IPC, Sections 13(1)D, 13(1)C, 13(2) of Prevention
As per the allegations made in the FIR, it is alleged that
financial budget was allotted to Directorate, Ayurvedic
Evam Unani Services for the Financial Years 1990-91,
1991-92 and 1992-93, however, it is alleged that amount
expended was much more than the amount allotted. On
the basis of which, FIR was lodged and after investigation
by the Vigilance Establishment, charge-sheet dated
15.09.2020 has been submitted and after due sanction,
cognizance has been taken by the court below and the
applicant has been summoned to face trial vide order
Perusal of the record shows that Vigilance Establishment
after thorough investigation has submitted the charge-
sheet dated 15.09.2020 against the applicant and the
court below after thoughtful consideration has taken the
cognizance on the same vide order dated 03.01.2019,
against which, present application under Section 482
CrPC has been filed by the applicant before this Court.
Learned counsel for the applicant has submitted that from
the allegations made in the FIR and the material collected
during the course of investigation, no offence is made out
against the applicant and as such, charge-sheet be
Learned counsel for the applicant has further submitted
that FIR in the present case was lodged on 03.03.1997,
however, sanction for prosecution was granted on
19.06.2018 after considerable delay of more than 20
years and therefore, the applicant has already suffered
because of protracted legal proceedings and as such,
entire proceedings be quashed.
In order to buttress her arguments, learned counsel for
the applicant has placed reliance upon the decisions of
Hon'ble Apex Court reported in Criminal Appeal No.
1038 of 2001 (Mahendra Lal Das Vs. State of Bihar
and others) and in Criminal Appeal No. 198 of 1992
(Ramanand Chaudhary Vs. State of Bihar and others)
and has prayed that entire proceedings be quashed
against the applicant in view of the said decisions.
Per contra, learned AGA has vehemently opposed the
said prayer of counsel for the applicant and has submitted
that from the allegations made in the FIR and the material
collected during the course of investigation, prime facie
offence is clearly made out against the applicant and it is
trite law that in matter of corruption, no such latitude can
be given.
It is further submitted that a sum of Rs.17.27 crores is
said to have been embezzled, as such, the entire
proceedings cannot be quashed and the court is not
required to hold a mini trial at this stage.
Having considered the rival submissions of learned
counsel for the parties and taking into consideration the
entire allegations made in the FIR and the material
collected during the course of investigation, I do not find
any illegality in the impugned order.
It is well settled that for successful working of democracy,
it is essential that public revenues are not defrauded and
the public servants do not indulge in corruption and if they
do, allegations of corruption are inquired into fairly and
properly and those, who are guilty, are brought to book.
The abuse of public office for private gain has grown in
scope and scale and hit the nation badly, corruption
reduces revenue. It slows down economic activity and
hold back economic growth. In recent times, there has
been concern over the need to ensure that the corridor of
power remain untainted by corruption and nepotism and
there is optimum utilization of resources and funds.
Corruption has potentiality to destroy many a progressive
aspect and has acted as formidable enemy of the nation.
Hon'ble Apex Court in the cases reported in (2005) 4
SCC 81 C.S. Krishnamurthy Vs. State of Karnataka
and (2014) 14 SCC 95 CBI Vs. Ashok Kumar Agarwal
has consistently held that no latitude can be given in the
matter of corruption and therefore, the entire proceedings
can not be quashed on the ground of delay. The
impugned order passed by the court below is just, proper
and legal and do not call for any interference at this stage.
The present application under Section 482 CrPC is devoid
of merit and is accordingly dismissed.
