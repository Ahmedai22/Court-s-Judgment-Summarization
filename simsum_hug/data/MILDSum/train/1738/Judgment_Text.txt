1.    This         is   a  petition         preferred               under
Article 226 of the Constitution of India.
2.    Brief         facts   leading        to     the         present
petition are as follow:
2.1      The petitioner is a sole proprietor of
JBM Textiles, Surat and is engaged in the
business of textile trading and export. The
Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (‘the
DRI’       hereinafter),        Ahmedabad          Zonal            Unit,
Ahmedabad had, on receipt of intelligence,
searched            the   office          premise           of          the
petitioner on dated 03.04.2019 where the
cash amount of Rs.35,99,000/- belonging to
the petitioner and his family members and
two mobile phones also were seized by the
officers. Panchnama was drawn on seizure by
the     officers        where    the      signature           of        the
petitioner was taken on 04.04.2019 which as
explained by him, was a forcible act thrust
upon him by the respondents.
2.2        The statement of the petitioner was
recorded on 04.04.2019, after the panchnama
proceedings dated 03.04.2019. There was no
proposal for confiscation of seized cash of
Rs.35,99,000/- and also of mobile phones,
computer and documents seized during this
2.3        A show cause notice came to be issued
on    27.11.2020     in respect        of    the        alleged
illegal export by one M/s.Amira Impex in
connivance of number of other persons which
included the petitioner, as alleged by the
respondents.       This  show        cause     notice             was
received by the petitioner on 14.12.2020.
2.4        As      averred      by       the  petitioner,                   19
months elapsed after the seizure. No notice
since had been issued within a period of
six months as statutorily prescribed from
date of the seizure, the seized cash and
mobile phones were needed to be returned to
the petitioner and his family, hence, this
3.    This Court at the time of issuance of
notice           passed      the       following         order              on
“1.      The petitioner is before this Court seeking the
return of the seized cash amounting to Rs.35,99,000/-
belonging to the petitioner and his family members and
two mobile phones seized from the office of the petitioner
on 03.04.2019 without issuance of any show cause notice
and in violation of provisions of Section 110 (2) of the
Customs Act, 1962 with the following prayers:
(A)   This Hon’ble Court may be pleased to hold
that the impugned panchnama proceedings dated
03.04.2019 as well as the non-return of the seized
currency   of    Rs.35,99,000/-       belonging         to     the
petitioner and his family members along with two
seized mobile phones after expiry of the statutory
period of six months provided in section 110(2) of
the Customs Act, 1962 is ex-facie illegal, non-est
and ab initio void due to violation statutory
provisions in Section 110 and other provisions of
the Customs Act, 1962 as interpreted by the
Courts of law in respect of return of seized
currency,   goods       and    things    lying     with        the
authorities without issue of show cause notice
within the period prescribed in said section.
B.     That this Honourable Court may be pleased
to hold that the seized currency amounting to
Nine Thousand Only) and two mobile phones be
returned   to    the     petitioner   forthwith         by     the
Respondent No.3 and Respondent No.4 herein.
C.     That this Hon’ble Court may be pleased to
issue a writ of mandamus or in the nature of
mandamus or any other writ, order or direction
quashing and setting aside the impugned seizure
and continued retention of the currency and two
mobile phones through panchnama proceedings
dated 03.04.2019 for the period beyond the expiry
of six months, that is, beyond 03.10.2019 without
issue of show cause notice under Section 124 of
the Customs Act, 1962 as lacking in jurisdiction,
harsh, unfair, illegal, absurd and therefore non-est
with consequential relief to the Petitioner as per
Prayer B above;
D.     That this Honourable Court may be pleased
to grant ad-interim and interim reliefs in terms of
prayer (C) above pending admission, hearing and
final disposal of this Special Civil Application.
E.     For award of the costs of this Petition.
F.     For such other and further or incidental
reliefs as may be deemed just and proper in the
facts and circumstances of the present case may
kindly be granted.”
2. We   have    heard   extensively  the   learned       advocate,
Mr.S.S.Iyer appearing for the petitioner, who also has
taken us through the material which has been placed on
record and also the Circular No.07 of 2013 dated
19.03.2013 based on the decision of the Delhi High Court
rendered in case Kore Koncepts vs. Deputy Commissioner
of Customs, reported in 2016 (333) ELT 76. Reliance is
also placed on the decision of this Court rendered in case
of Deepak Natvarlal Soni vs. Union of India, reported in
2019 (368) ELT 27. His emphasis is therefore, since six
months from the date of seizure as no show cause notice
under Section 124 of the Customs Act for the good seized
has been issued, there shall need to be returned of the
seized goods.
3. Issue urgent NOTICE, returnable on 13.10.2021.
4. Over and above the regular mode of service, direct
service through speed post as well as e-mode is also
permitted.”
4.    In reply to the show cause notice, the
respondents appeared and their reply has
also been tendered before this Court.
4.1.           In   the    affidavit-in-reply,                   it has
been        denied        that     there        has       been            any
violation            of     the        provision           of           law.
According to the respondents, since it is a
case of a large scale illegal availment of
the       export        benefits,           no  indulgence                   is
necessary.           It    is   also         contended          by        the
respondents that specific information had
been received by the DRI, Ahmedabad that
certain export firms were wrongly availing
export benefits including IGST refund on
the       basis       of    bogus/overvalued                exports,
therefore, the operation had been carried
out at the premise of Shri Kuberji Textiles
Park by a joint team of DRI and Directorate
of     General          of   Goods         and     Service               Tax
Intelligence,             Ahmedabad         (DGGI)          and          the
panchnama           had   been    drawn       in    presence                of
three         persons      namely         Shri    Mihir          Mahesh
Chevli,            Mr.Amit      Doctor          and         Mr.Aazam
Sabuwala. They jointly operated different
firms which included eight firms and those
persons           had  admitted         that   they        were          not
proprietors/partners/directors                       of       any           of
the firms.
4.2          The Indian currency notes totaling
Rs.1,00,85,100/-             had      been     seized          out          of
which        Rs.35,99,000/-          is     claimed        by         Shri
Amit        Doctor.      These        three     persons               were
getting commission from third party export
Scheme in cash. They arranged invoices                                     in
the name of export firm, but no goods were
physically             received           under       the             said
documents           and  they     made       payment          towards
this said supply on paper from the account
of     the        respective    export        firms        and          the
money were returned back to them by the
respective supplier in cash or by middleman
through whom the said bills were arranged.
The cash amount received by them were in
the form commission from the third party
export           in   EPCG   Scheme          and      the           money
returned back by the supplier on paper. As
no      proper        and   satisfactory             reply              was
received           during  the      search,       the       DIR         and
DGGI      officers     had    detained         the       cash          for
further verification. Statements were also
recorded under Section 108 of the Customs
Act, 1962 (‘the Act’ hereinafter) and the
modus operandi has been explained by those
4.3           The    amount,          according           to           the
respondents, which has been claimed by Shri
Amit Doctor was the amount of IGST refund,
which       was    fraudulently          availed        and          that
needed         to be   treated         as  EPCG      commission
income and was liable to be taxed under the
GST Act. Both the income of EPCG commission
and     IGST      refund    were         received         in         cash
covered under the GST Law. The statements
recorded of the petitioner and other are
contended to voluntary without adopting any
coercive measure. Allegation of force on
expiry of 21 months is afterthought on the
part        of      the  petitioner.               Emphatically
further           contended   that         DRI   and       DGGI          are
organizational structure of Central Board
of    Indirect         Taxes    and        Customs.        The         cash
seized          is   amount   of      commission           and         IGST
refund wrongly availed. DGGI is claimed to
be the proper authority to appropriate the
said amount against the IGST refund wrongly
availed           and  the  cash         was   transferred                  to
DGGI, Ahmedabad as the total IGST refund
wrongly           and  illegally         availed       is      of        the
tune of Rs.3,27,61,295/-, which is alleged
to be a grave economic offence and hence
request is not to interfere.
5.    The learned advocate, Mr.S.S.Iyer for
the petitioner and learned senior standing
counsel,             Mr.Priyank            Lodha         for             the
respondents-department                     have      been             heard
6.    The short question for consideration is
as to whether the show cause notice given
under        Section     124    of       the   Act       after            six
months of seizure can be sustained under
the law.
7.    The         challenge    made         is    also         to         the
alleged arbitrary action on the part of the
respondents-authority in retaining the cash
amount          of   Rs.35,99,000/-           along        with           two
mobile          phones   and     other        material            seized
from        the      office    of        the     petitioner                  on
03.04.2019. The seizure of goods and the
cash by the respondents is under section
110 of the Customs Act and Section 124 of
the Act provides for the show cause notice
to be issued for the confiscation of the
7.1           The     key  contention           raised          by        the
petitioner             is    that           the     respondents-
authority           has   not      followed         the         mandate
provided under Sub-section (2) of Section
110 of the Act that the goods seized under
Sub-section (1) of Section 110 of the Act
shall need to be returned to the person
from      whom       they  were        seized.       As      provided
under Sub-section (2) of Section 110 of the
Act, if no show cause notice is given under
clause (a) of Section 124 of the Act in
respect           of    such     goods,         cash        and           the
articles within six months of the seizure
of the goods, the same needs to be refunded
to the person from whom they are seized.
7.2            The amendment in the Finance Act,
2018       provided      that      the       sufficient               cause
being shown, such period could be extended
by the Principal Commissioner of Customs or
Commissioner           of   Goods          for   a     period             not
exceeding six months.
7.3            Section    124     of        the    Act       provides
that no order of confiscation of any goods
or imposing of penalty on any person is to
be     made        under   Chapter           XIV,     unless              the
notice has been served upon the person who
is the owner of the goods, in writing with
prior approval of the officer of customs
not       below       the    rank           of    an       Assistant
Commissioner            of    Customs           informing                 the
grounds on which it is to be confiscated or
for imposition of penalty.
7.4     The mode of service of notice prior to
the amendment by Finance Act, 2018 included
the summons or notice issued under Section
153 of the Act. This Court (Coram:Justice
Anant S. Dave & Justice Biren Vaishnav) in
case of Deepak Natvarlal Soni vs. Union of
India, reported in 2019 (368) ELT 27 (Guj.)
was      considering the         similar      issue             and
addressed this question of issuance of the
notice as envisaged under Section 110(2)
vis-a-vis Section 124 and Section 153 which
is no longer res integra. After a detailed
discussion, it had held that the action of
respondents-authority in not returning the
goods seized upon failure to comply with
Sections 110(2), 124 and 153 of the Act, is
illegal and the writ petition was allowed
by directing the respondents to return                          all
gold ornaments/gold items and two apple I-
phones          seized       under           panchnama           to          the
petitioner             within         a       specified              period
unconditionally               subject           to     adjudication
process           to    be     carried           out       afresh               in
accordance with law.
7.5           The     relevant           paragraphs             will            be
profitably reproduced:
“9. Having heard learned counsels appearing for the
parties,   at  the    outset,     outcome     of     adjudication
proceedings resulting into finality with regard to subject
seizure of goods at the end of competent authority, no
record is produced and no affidavit is filed in this
regard.
The issue about giving notice so envisaged under
Section 110 (2)of the Customs Act, 1962 vis-a-vis Section
124 and Section 153 is no more res integra.
For better appreciation and above provisions of Customs
Act, 1962 we produce herein below such provisions
governing seizure in the year 2017 that is before
amendment carried out by Finance Act, 2018.
“110. Seizure of goods, documents and things.-(1) If the
proper officer has reason to believe that any goods are
liable to confiscation under this Act, he may seize such
Provided that where it is not practicable to seize any
such goods, the proper officer may serve on the owner
of the goods an order that he shall not remove, part
with, or otherwise deal with the goods except with the
previous permission of such officer.
(2) Where any goods are seized under subsection (1) and
no notice in respect thereof is given under clause (a) of
section 124 within six months of the seizure of the
goods, the goods shall be returned to the person from
whose possession they were seized” {Provided that the
aforesaid period of six months may, on sufficient cause
being shown, be extended by the Principal Commissioner
of Customs or Commissioner or Customs for a period not
exceeding six months.}
Section   124.   Issue    of     show  cause     notice       before
confiscation of goods, etc.-No order confiscating any
goods or imposing any penalty on any person shall be
made under this Chapter unless the owner of the goods
or such person-
(a) is given a notice in [writing with the prior approval
of the officer of customs not below the rank of [an
Assistant Commissioner of Customs], informing] him of
the grounds on which it is proposed to confiscate the
goods or to impose a penalty;
(b) is given an opportunity of making a representation in
writing within such reasonable time as may be specified
in the notice against the grounds of confiscation or
imposition of penalty mentioned therein;
(c) is given a reasonable opportunity of being heard in
the matter.
Provided that the notice referred to in clause (a) and the
representation referred to in clause (b) may at the
request of the person concerned be oral.
153. Service of order, decision, etc.- Any order or
decision passed or any summons or notice issued under
this Act, shall be served,-
(a) by tendering the order, decision, summons or notice
or sending it by registered post or by such courier as
may be approved by the Commissioner of Customs;
(b) if the order, decision, summons of notice cannot be
served in the manner provided in clause (a), by affixing
it on the notice board of the customs house”.
10. It is not in dispute that seizure of goods in question
was effected on 11.2.2017 in the arrival hall of terminal
No.2 of SVPI Airport, Ahmedabad, in presence of
panchas and seizure memo was issued accordingly on the
same day. Further, request was made by the petitioners
for   returning   seized    ornaments      and    ‘I    phones’         on
19.8.2017, reminder dated 1.9.2017 wherein reference
was made to seizure memo dated 11.2.2017 and various
decision of Delhi High Court and also that of Supreme
Court which mandated return of seizure goods in case of
failure of giving notice within six months from the date
of seizure which was over in the facts of the case on
11.8.2017. That reply dated 12.9.2017 was received from
the     office   of    Assistant      Commissioner,          Customs,
Ahmedabad wherein it was stated that show cause notice
dated     9.8.2017    has     been     issued    from       file      No.
VIII/10-12/SVPIA/O&A/2017              by      the         Additional
Commissioner, Customs, Ahmedabad and was delivered at
the residence of the petitioners under proper panchnama
dated     10.8.2017   since      residential   premises         of     the
petitioners was found to be locked. In addition to the
above, a copy of show cause notice was also affixed on
the notice board of Customs House, Ahmedabad on
10.8.2017 in terms of provisionsof Section 153 (b) of the
Customs Act, 1962 and, therefore, seized articles were
not to be released and the petitioners were requested to
join the adjudication procedure. The above fact is
reflected in the affidavit dated 30.10.2017 filed by Dy.
Commissioner of Customs (Air Intelligent Unit) SVPI
11. In view of the above stand it is categorically stated
by the petitioners that they had not received any such
notice given by the authority and claim about service of
notice by fixation by inserting the same in the residential
premises in presence of panchas or fixation of such
notice on the notice board of the Customs House etc.
were denied and, for which, the petitioners had no
knowledge. It was further stated that Mr. Deepak Soni,
petitioner no. 1was admitted to the hospital for heart
ailment. They had not attended even their business,
however,    son  of   petitioner  no.1   was     through         out
available at the shop as he was looking after the business
when the petitioner no.1 was unwell. It is further borne
out from the record, various summons were issued by
custom authorities to appear and cooperate but had no
occasion the petitioners remained present before the
authority. That apart, no record is available or produced
before this Court that show cause notice was given in
terms of Section 110 (2) read with Section 124 and
service thereof as envisaged under Section 153 of the
Act, 1962. That so called panchnama drawn by the
authority reveal that two panchas were taken from
Amraiwadi and Vastral area of Ahmedabad away at the
distance of more than 20 Km. And in their presence
residential house of the petitioners was found locked and
no person was available there. Since it was raining, it
was thought fit not to fix the notice and it was inserted
through grill of the door of the house of the petitioners
in a green colour polythene bag.
12. If the law in this regard is considered in the case of
Ambalal Moraraji Soni (supra) this Court by considering
provisions of Gold (Control) Act and also that of Section
124 of Customs Act, 1962 refer to decisions of the Apex
Court in the case of Narasimhiab v. Singri Gowda, AIR
1966 SC 330 where giving notice was interpreted that as
soon as the person with a legal duty to give the notice
despatches the notice to the address of the person to
whom it has to be given the giving is not complete.
Even    the    Apex  Court       also considered       concept         of
reasonable opportunity to be given of being heard and
other aspects. Further by referring to Section 110 (2) of
Customs Act and Section 79 of the Gold (Control) Act,
this court referred to the case of Assistant Collector of
Customs v. Charan Das Malhotra AIR 1972 SC 689 in
which it was held as under:
“The right to restoration of the seized goods is a
civil right which accrues on the expiry of the
initial six months ad which is defeated on an
extension   being      granted,    even     though        such
extension is possible within a year from the date
of the seizure. Consequently such a vested civil
right in the respondent cannot be defeated by an
ex parte order of extension of time by the
Collector. An opportunity to be heard should be
available even in a case where extension is
granted before expiry of the initial six months,
after which period alone the respondent can
claim the right to return of the seized goods.”
Thereafter, discussing the facts of the case on hand the
Division Bench held as under:
“Giving of the notice contemplated by Section
124 of the Customs Act and Section 79 of the
Gold Control Act means that the notice must have
been received because as pointed out by the
Supreme Court in Narasimhiah’s case, AIR 1966
SC 330 (supra) the giving of the notice is not
complete unless and until it reaches the person
concerned or its actual tender to him. Merely
despatching of the notice to the address of the
person does not complete the giving of the notice.
I the instant case, therefore, the fact that the
respondents despatched the notices by post on
November 5, 1968, would not complete the giving
of the notice. The giving of the notice should
have been completed on or before November 6,
1968    i.e.   notices      should   have     reached          the
petitioner on or before November 6, 1969 or
should have been tendered to him before that
date. That was not done in the instant case and,
therefore, as from November 7, 1969, the civil
right to get back the seized goods accrued to the
petitioner.”
13. That in another decision in the case of Purushottam
Jajodia v. Director of Revenue Intelligence, New Delhi,
once again considered the case of K. Narasimhiah (supra)
AIR 1966 SC 330 and reiterated that notice can be
regarded as ‘given’ only when it is received by the party
and mere its issues within the said time-limit not
sufficient. Again in the case of New Drug Y Chemical
Co. v. Union of India (supra) the Division Bench of
Bombay       High    Court       considered    requirement            of
compliance of provisions of Section 153 (a) of Customs
Act, 1962 held that sending of order by “Speed Post” is
not sufficient compliance of the above provisions and
order is to be served upon assessee or his agent sending
it by Registered Post A.D. Or by other modes of service
and that Section 153 (a) will come into play only when
service was not envisaged under Section 153(a) is not
possible then only affixation of notice board of the
Customs House is permitted.
14. Thus, in the facts of this case submissions made by
learned counsel for the petitioner and facts as well as on
law remained virtually un-answered and the petitioners
were not given notice so envisaged under Section 110 (2)
read with Section 124 and Section 153 of the Customs
Act, 1962 and the case on hand is covered by the
decision to which we have made reference in earlier
paragraph and the case of the petitioners is further
strengthened    that    procedure     followed      by      drawing
panchnama etc. was of no use and the same cannot be
termed as compliance with provisions of the Act, 1962,
Even the decision relied on by Mr. Mitesh Amin, learned
advocate for the respondents in the case of                vs. Ram
Kumar     Agarwal    reported      in  2012    (280)       ELT       13
(M.P.)submitted that the Bombay High Court simply
considered provisions of Section 110 (2), 124, 153 of the
Customs Act and in the facts appeared before it, appeal
filed by the authority was allowed. In the above case
also the court concluded that service of notice will be
complete either by tendering or by sending the same by
registered post A.D. And such facts cannot be equated
with the facts of this case and that of High Court of
Karnataka dated 22.4.2015 in the case of K.Abdulla
Kunhi Abdul Rahaman will have no bearing on the facts
of this case since it was categorically placed on record
by the department that show cause notice was already
despatched on 13.3.2014 which came to be delivered on
the petitioner on 17.3.2014 after the expiry of two days
of period of six months so envisaged under Sub-Section
(2) of Section 110 of the Act.”
7.6           In case of Kore Koncepts vs. Deputy
Commissioner of Customs (SIIB), reported in
2016(333) E.L.T.76 (Del.) where the show
cause          notice      was        not       issued            within
stipulated period according to the Court,
the seizure order would not sustain and the
goods           which      were             released            earlier
provisionally            were        held       to     have             been
released          unconditionally              and        the           Bank
Guarantee          furnished             at     the        time              of
provisional release would cease to operate,
the same also was required to be returned
following         the    earlier           decision        of        Jatin
Ahuja        vs.    Union      of       India,      reported                 in
of Delhi in case of Jatin Ahuja (supra)
held as under:-
“9. It can be gathered from the above discussion that the
provision of Section 110(2) insofar as the prescription of a
time limit for holding seized goods, is deemed mandatory;
the consequence of not issuing a show cause notice within
the period or extended period specified is clearlys pelt out
to be that the ‘goods shall be returned to the person from
whose possession they were seized’ (apparent from a
combined reading of Section 110(2) and its proviso). The
corollary is not that the Customs authorities lose jurisdiction
to issue show cause notice.
13. In the light of the above discussion, the Petition has to
succeed. It is declared that the effect of non-issuance of
show cause notice under Section 124 in this case, has
resulted in the operation of Section 110(2) and the statutory
dissolution of the seizure order made in the case of the
Petitioner’s car. The said vehicle ‘released provisionally and
subject to conditions under Section 110A’ shall be deemed
to have been unconditionally released. If the Maserati car
has not been released, the same shall be released within
two weeks and the superdarinama is hereby quashed. The
writ petition is allowed in the above terms;no costs.”
8.    Reverting to the facts on hands, M/s.
Amira Impex of Maharashtra engaged in the
business           of  various         items     is     alleged               to
have indulged in gross over valuation and
mis-declaration of the export goods with an
intent to wrongfully avail IGST refund in
various other export related incentives.
9.    A search was conducted at the office
premise of the proprietor of JBM Textiles
Shri Amit Harishankar Doctor and also of
Shri       Mihir      Mahesh     Chevli         and     Shri           Aazam
Sabuwala           at   Surat.       The       statements                were
recorded           of  the   authorized             signatory                 of
about           eight     firms,            which       were             also
operating            independently             from        the           same
premise.           It   also     was         alleged        that           the
export of the goods were made in the names
of five firms out of the eight firms which
were       called      upon     to       show     cause          to        the
Additional/Joint             Commissioner              of        Customs
for FOB value of export goods under the
provision of Section 14(1) of the Act read
with           Rule     8     of          Customs           Valuation
(Determination of Value of Export Goods)
Rules, 2007 and under Rule 6 of the Customs
Valuation (Determination of Value of Export
10.            The   notice     for       confiscation                 and
penalty also was given under the Act on
27.11.2020.            Admittedly,              the            search
proceedings had been carried out as per the
panchnama          drawn  and         placed     before              this
Court on 03.04.2019. The statements have
also been recorded on 04.04.2019 and a show
cause notice          had been issued on 27.11.2020
for the alleged illegal export attempted by
M/s.Ameera Impex by the Additional Director
served upon the petitioner on 14.12.2020.
Admittedly, this notice of confiscation is
issued          beyond    the     prescribed            statutory
period of six months.
10.1          The interim reply to the said show
cause notice was filed on 12.01.2021. Since
not    responded,        a   reminder        had      also           been
sent on 21.01.2021. The cash and the seized
articles          since  continued         to    be      with          the
respondents,           present         petition        has           been
10.2        Mandate      of       Sub-section             (2)             of
Section 110 of the Act is crystal clear
that if no notice is given under clause (a)
of section 124 of the Act for confiscation
within six months of the seizure of the
goods, the goods shall be returned to the
person         from    whose     possession          they            were
seized            provided      that        the         Principal
Commissioner of Customs for reasons to be
recorded in writing can extend this period,
not exceeding the period of six months and
inform the concerned person from whom such
goods       were     seized     before       expiry           of        the
period so specified. It is further needed
to be specified that where an order for
provisional release of the seized goods has
been passed under Section 110 A of the Act,
the specified period of six months shall
not apply.
11.         In    the    instant          case,       admittedly
there has been no provisional release of
the seized goods.            Further extension of six
months         with   the  reasoned         order             by        the
Principal           Commissioner           of      Customs                 or
Commissioner of Customs also is completely
missing. The period of six months from the
date of signature expired on 03.10.2019.
Even       further       period         of     six      months               as
provided in the first proviso to Section
110(2)         also    got   over          on   03.04.2020.                  Of
course, in absence of any order, much less
reasoned           order   by     prescribed            authority,
extension would need to be disregarded yet,
the    respondents         chose         not    to     return             the
seized currency or mobile phones and the
request           of  the  petitioner            has       not          been
addressed nor replied to.
12.         Noticing that the period prescribed
under        the     law   has      already         lapsed              long
before         the    show    cause          notice        has          been
issued, this Court needs to intervene for
this being a clear violation of statutory
provisions            of   section            110      and            other
provisions of Customs Act, these items are
required to be returned to the petitioner.
13.         The Court notices that nothing has
been explained in the entire reply of 27
paragraphs          with     regard        to        the            non
compliance of the statutory mandate under
Section 110(1)(2) read with Section 124 of
the Act. It is quite unfathomable as to why
the     time      limit  is      not    adhered          to         and
issuance of the show cause notice has been
delayed beyond the statutory time period
and hence, intervention will be necessary
at the end of this Court by keeping open
the rights of the respondents to initiate
adjudication process afresh in accordance
with law.
14.         Resultantly,       present       petition                  is
allowed. Respondents shall return the cash
and articles/goods to the petitioner not
later         than  period    of       eight     weeks          seized
from the petitioner. Respondents shall be
at         liberty     to      initiate             action                 of
adjudication, in accordance with law,                                      if
permissible under the law otherwise.
15.           No order as to costs.
