Punjab and Haryana High Court while dealing with an appeal filed by the widow claiming right over the suit property on the basis of natural succession, held that appellant's husband was not the owner of the suit land on the date of his death, therefore, the question of inheritance of the estate does not arise. It has been held that late Sh. Baldev Singh was not the owner of the suit land on the date of his death. Hence, the question of inheritance of the estate does not arise. The bench comprising Justice Anil Kshetarpal was dealing with the case where the original plaintiff filed the instant appeal, assailing the correctness of the concurrent findings of fact arrived at by the Courts below. The plaintiff claimed the suit property based on natural succession, claiming that her late husband owned and possessed the same. She filed a suit against 4 of her sons and subsequent purchasers from her 4 sons. The Court considered the written statement by the defendants which claimed that the husband of the appellant in the Civil Court acknowledged the 4 sons to be the owners in possession of the property resulting in a judgment and decree passed by the Civil Court in their favor.
