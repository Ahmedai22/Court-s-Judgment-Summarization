While assailing the correctness of the concurrent findings of
fact arrived at by the Courts below, the plaintiff has filed the present appeal.
She claims property on the basis of natural succession. It was
claimed that the property in question was owned and possessed by her
husband late Sh. Baldev Singh. She filed a suit against 4 of her sons and
subsequent purchasers from her 4 sons.           In the written statement, the
defendants submitted that late Sh. Baldev Singh in the Civil Court
acknowledged the 4 sons to be the owners in possession of the property
resulting in a judgment and decree passed by the Civil Court in their favour.
The sons also claimed that late Sh. Baldev Singh, as a
precautionary measure, bequeathed the property by an unregistered Will
dated 25.11.1994, to them.       It has been stated that defendant no.3 has
adopted defendant No's 2 son and now the intention of defendant no.3 and
his wife has become dishonest and that's why they have challenged the
RSA-4275 of 2015(O&M)                                             -2-
adoption. It has also come on record that the sons had transferred the
property in favour of defendant no.5 and 6 by the registered sale deeds on
receipt of valuable consideration.
Both the Courts have found that the plaintiff has not challenged
the correctness of Civil Court judgment and decree dated 03.10.1991. It has
been held that late Sh. Baldev Singh was not the owner of the suit land on
the date of his death. Hence, the question of inheritance of the estate does
not arise.
Consequently, finding no merit in the facts of the case.
All the pending miscellaneous applications, if any, are also
disposed of.
