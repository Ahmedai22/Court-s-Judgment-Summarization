1.     The jurisdiction of this Court under Article 32 of the Constitution has been invoked
by MBBS graduate doctors who have appeared for the NEET – PG 2021 and have
participated in the ongoing counselling process for 2021-2022. Their grievance pertains
to the schedule which has been prescribed by the National Board of Examinations for
holding the NEET-PG 2022 examination, which is due to commence on 21 May 2022.
They seek the issuance of a direction for:
(i)    Postponement of the NEET-PG 2022 examination which is to commence on 21
(ii)   Notification of a fresh date for the examination after a period of eight weeks so that
in the meantime the issue of counselling for the NEET-PG 2021 examination gets
resolved and to avoid an overlap of the former with the NEET-PG 2022 examination; and
(iii)  A direction to the respondents to permit students who have participated in the
counselling for the NEET-PG 2021 examination to register for the NEET-PG 2022
examination by extending the last date for registration (25 March 2022).
2      We have heard Mr Rakesh Khanna, Mr Anand Grover and Mr P Wilson, senior
counsel appearing on behalf of the petitioners. Ms Aishwarya Bhati, Additional Solicitor
General has appeared on behalf of the respondents.
3      In view of the urgency of the issue, it has been taken up for final disposal on the
basis of the submissions which have been placed on the record by counsel appearing
on either side.
4      The NEET-PG examination for 2022-2023 is due to be held on 21 May 2022.
Registration for the ensuing examination stands closed on 25 March 2022. The grievance
of the petitioners is that they have not been allowed a fair opportunity to participate, which
violates their fundamental rights particularly under Articles 14 and 21 of the Constitution.

5       The second column of above chart indicates the course of events for the NEET-
PG 2021 entrance examination. The first round of counselling took place between 12 and
22 January 2022. The second round took place between 3 January to 12 February 2022
and was extended up to 18 February 2022. Thereafter, mop up/stray rounds have taken
place up to 7 May 2022. The States are holding their counselling sessions till 12 May
2022. The NEETPG 2022 examination was originally scheduled for 12 March 2022, but
was postponed due to a clash of counselling dates. This was noticed in a judgment of
this Court in Shivam Satyarthee and Others vs Union of India and Others 1 . In
paragraph 4 of the judgment, this Court observed:
“One of the grounds on which the petition under Article 32 of the Constitution was instituted was that
there was a likely clash between the schedule of counselling for NEET-PG 2021-22 and the NEET-
PG examination for the ensuing academic year. This aspect of the matter has now been resolved
as a result of the postponement of the NEET-PG examination.”
6       The new date for NEET-PG 2022 has been fixed as 21 May 2022. The results are
expected on 20 June 2022. Senior counsel appearing on behalf of the petitioners urged
that the petitioners are doctors who have rendered Covid duties in the past two years
and were participating in the counselling process following the NEET-PG 2021 entrance
examination and that process was to end on 12 May 2022. It has been submitted that an
extension of about two months may be granted for conducting the NEET-PG 2022 for
the ensuing academic year. Counsel submitted that representations have been made by
the doctors similarly circumstanced and if an extension is granted, this would cause no
prejudice to the Union Government while at the same time giving the petitioners and
similarly placed candidates as well as those doctors who have registered, additional time
to study for the ensuing examination.
7        Mr P Wilson, senior counsel has placed reliance on a public notice dated 5 May
2022 issued by the National Medical Commission2 which intimated all medical colleges
and institutes that the last date for filling information relating to admissions made for Post
Graduate (Broad and Super Specialty courses) for 2021-2022 on the NMC portal was
extended to 9 May 2022.
8        Ms Aishwarya Bhati, Additional Solicitor General has while opposing the
submissions urged that:
(i)      The issue as to whether a postponement should be effected of the NEET-PG 2022
entrance examination was a matter of serious deliberation in the Ministry of Health and
Family Welfare and a conscious decision was taken on 10 May 2021 against postponing
the examination for reasons bearing on public interest and the needs of medical
(ii)     Any delay in conducting the NEET-PG 2022 examination would impact upon
patient care since this would lead to a fewer number of resident doctors in hospitals.
There are supposed to be three batches of doctors who are studying for PG courses and
are available for patient care and treatment in medical college hospitals. However, only
two batches are currently available because of the delay in conducting the examination
and any further postponement will be have a cascading effect on patient care, treatment
and other ancillary matters;
(iii)    The number of doctors who have registered for NEET-PG between the period
2019-2020 and 2022-2023 is indicated in the following table:
Academic Year          No. of Registered Doctors
(iv)     The NEET-PG 2022-2023 examination is scheduled to be held in January 2023.
Adhering to the schedule for the NEET-PG 2022 will allow the Union Government to put
the schedule back on track which was disturbed thus far due to the onset of the Covid-
19 pandemic.
(v)      The schedule has to be consistent with the order of this Court in Dr Ashish Ranjan
and Others vs Union of India and Others3;
(vi)     In terms of the judgment of this Court in Dr Ashish Ranjan ( supra), NMC moved
this Court for its approval of the time schedule, which has been granted on 9 May 2022;
Writ Petition (Civil) No 76 of 2015 dated 18.01.2016
(vii)   The Public Notice of the NMC dated 5 May 2022 did not extend time for completing
admissions and as a matter of fact, admissions have been closed on 7 May 2022.
9       While considering the rival submissions, it must be noted at the outset that the
academic session has been delayed by a period of four months when compared with the
schedule which has been prescribed by this Court by its order dated 18 January 2016 in
Dr Ashish Ranjan (supra). The schedule which has been prescribed by the order of this
Court is tabulated below:

12     The petitioners and similarly placed doctors have participated in the counseling
process for NEET-PG 2021. They were not barred from registering for NEET-PG 2022.
The registration for NEET-PG 2022 for the ensuing year has been closed on 25 March
2022. As many as 2,06,541 doctors have registered for the ensuing examination. The
submission of the petitioners that a postponement of the examination will cause no
prejudice to the Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare is specious. What must be
borne in mind is that there is a large batch of student - doctors on the other hand who
have registered for the entrance test. Moreover, the needs of patient care are paramount.
Over two lakh students have registered for the ensuing examination and their schedule
would be seriously affected if a further postponement is granted under a direction of this
Court. Postponement of exams results in chaos and uncertainty. During the onslaught of
the Covid waves, postponements may have been granted by the administering
authorities when confronted with an unprecedented human crisis. This should not
become the norm. Doing so will disturb the sanctity of medical education. As the country
gets back on the rails after the dislocation which was caused due to the Covid-19
pandemic, it is necessary that the decision which has been taken by the Union Ministry
of Health and Family Welfare of adhering to the time schedule must be accepted. An
important consideration which has weighed in the decision not to postpone the NEET-
PG 2022 examination is that any delay in conducting the examination will lead to a fewer
number of resident doctors in hospitals. This year, only two batches are currently
available because of the delay in holding the examination, resulting in serious deficiency
in the required strength of doctors in hospitals. This impacts patient care and results in
back-breaking loads of work for the existing doctors. Their quality of life, dignity and well-
being are also of concern.
13     In this backdrop, while the request which has been made by the petitioners for a
further postponement of the NEET-PG examination may seem innocuous from their
perspective, it cannot be entertained for the reason that this would seriously impact upon
availability of patient care and qualified postgraduate doctors. It is likely to have a
cascading effect on patient care and on the careers of those doctors who have already
registered in large numbers for the ensuing examination. These matters essentially
pertain to policy domain. Unless the Court is satisfied that the decision which has been
taken by the authorities is without application of mind to relevant circumstances or was
manifestly arbitrary, there would no reason for the Court to interfere. Postponement of
any examination is replete with serious consequences. While one body of the students
may be interested in seeking a postponement, there will be a large number of other
students who have studied and have registered for the examination who would be
seriously affected. Above all, the needs of patient care and treatment must be paramount
in the clash of rival interests between those doctors who have registered for the ensuing
examination and those who have not registered. Balancing of priorities in administration
is a difficult task. The task is entrusted to the executive and not to courts. Hence, in our
considered view, the reliefs which have been sought in these proceedings cannot be
14     The petition shall accordingly stand dismissed.
15     Pending applications, if any, stand disposed of.
