2.   These two petitions for Special Leave to Appeal, now
appeals on grant of leave, have been listed as connected
matters and heard by us as such. A learned Single Judge of the
Rajasthan High Court in an order passed on 31st March, 2020,
from which SLP (Crl.) No. 5618 of 2021 originated, had directed
the Registrar (Judicial) of the High Court to not to list bails,
appeals, applications for suspension of sentence in appeals and
revisions in the category of extreme urgent matters. We shall
henceforth    refer   to   that    application    (S.B.  Criminal
Miscellaneous Second Bail Application No. 17767 of 2019) filed
in the High Court as the first bail application. The same learned
Judge, in the other order, passed on 17th May 2021 giving rise
to SLP (Crl.) No. 3949 of 2021, had directed the police
authorities not to make arrest of persons in cases where the
accused is charged under an offence carrying maximum
sentence of three years and the offence is triable by a First
Class Magistrate. In this order also, direction had been given to
the High Court administration not to list bail applications
under Section 438 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (the
1973 Code) in offences where maximum sentence extends upto
three years and the offence which is triable by a First Class
Magistrate. When these orders were passed, the Covid-19
pandemic was raging across this country. This order was
passed in an application for anticipatory bail, registered as S.B.
Criminal Miscellaneous Bail Application No. 3125 of 2021 (the
second bail application). We, however, find that the bail plea of
the applicant was ultimately rejected by the High Court on 20th
May, 2020 in the first bail application. The second bail
application, which was for anticipatory bail, was also rejected
by the High Court on 2nd August, 2021.
3.    By an interim order passed by this Court on 25th May,
2021 in appeal brought by the High Court of Judicature for
Rajasthan, Bench at Jaipur there was interim stay of the
directions issued in Paragraphs 9, 10 and 11 of the impugned
order dated 17th May, 2021. The directions contained in
paragraphs 15 and 16 in the order passed on 31st March, 2020
was also stayed by an interim order passed by this Court on
3rd April, 2020. The order passed by the High Court in the first
bail application was to last till withdrawal of the order of
complete lockdown by the Government of India. The order in
the second bail application was to last till 17th July, 2021.
4.    The applicant in the first bail application was one
Shahrukh, who went unrepresented on the day the order was
passed.   This     order    contained,     inter-alia,    the    following
“13. Release of an accused or convict at the cost of
breaching the order of lockdown and at the cost of
risking lives of many cannot be considered to fall
within the category of "extreme urgent matter." It
is also relevant to note that Rajasthan High Court
has Holi, Dashera, Diwali and Winter vacations
ranging from few days to few weeks during which
period also Bail applications and applications for
suspension of sentence are not taken up by the
14. It is pertinent to mention that a report was
sought from DG Prisons who has reported that
there is no overcrowding in Prisons, there is
regular medical check up of inmates and all new
inmates are subject to medical check up and
wherever space is available are kept separately
before putting them with the inmates.
15. In view of the discussions made herein above,
this Court is of the considered view that at the
time when there is complete lockdown the bail
applications,     Appeals    under   SC/ST       Act,
applications for suspension of sentence can not be
considered to be of extreme urgency.
16. Registrar Judicial is directed not to list Bails,
appeals applications for suspension of sentence in
Appeals and Revisions in the category of "extreme
urgent matters".
17. All such matters and the present applications
be listed after the withdrawal of order of complete
lockdown by the Government of India.”
5.       The applicant in the second bail application was one
Than Singh, accused of offences under Sections 457 and 354
of the Indian Penal Code read with Section 67 of the
Information Technology Act, 2000. Observations made and
directions issued in this order were:-
“5. A query was put to learned Additional
Advocate General as to whether the police, which
is involved in other more important task of
enforcing the lock-down, be directed not to arrest
an accused charged with offence punishable with
a term, which may extend upto 3 years till
situation normalizes and for the time being, till
17th July, 2021, to which the learned Additional
Advocate General replied in affirmative.
6. Further, this Court is also of the opinion that
the arrest of persons in cases where imprisonment
extends upto 3 years and are triable by First Class
Magistrate under present circumstances will
prove to be counter-productive. If a person, who is
arrested and produced before the Magistrate and
thereafter, sent to Jail is an asymptomatic carrier
of Covid-19, the inmates may be put at risk.
7. Taking note of the above and also in view of
larger public interest, this Court is of the view that
the police may be restrained for the time being
from making arrest of the accused persons, who
are charged with offence where maximum
sentence is upto three years, till 17th July, 2021.
Thus, listing of bail applications under Section
438 Cr.P.C. both before Sessions Court as well as
High Court will be avoided.
8. Learned Additional Advocate General has
requested the Court to pass appropriate order so
that Director General of Police (for short “DGP”)
may be informed to comply with the same.
9. In light of the discussions made hereinabove
and considering the suggestions, I deem it proper
to direct the DGP to issue instructions to all the
Officers concerned in the State of Rajasthan not to
make arrest of persons in cases where accused is
charged under an offence where maximum
sentence extends upto three years and the offence
is triable by First Class Magistrate. The order
would remain in operation till 17th July, 2021.
10. A copy of this order be sent to the Registrar
General for issuance of necessary directions. The
Registrar (Judicial), Jaipur Bench, Jaipur & the
Registrar (Judicial), Principal Seat, Jodhpur, are
directed not to list bail applications under Section
438 Cr.P.C. in offences where maximum sentence
extends upto three years and the offence is triable
by First Class Magistrate till reopening of Courts
after Summer Vacation.”
6.    Since both the applications before the High Court stand
rejected now, under ordinary circumstances we would have
had    dismissed      these     appeals      having    been     rendered
infructuous. So far as service is concerned, the same was not
complete as against respondent no.2 (the applicant before the
High Court) in SLP (Crl.) No.5618 of 2021. But considering the
fact that his application stood ultimately rejected and in this
judgment we are considering the legality of the order
containing     certain    directions       upon     the   High     Court
administration, we chose to consider the appeal on merit.
Otherwise also, the impugned orders have outlived their
duration specified by the learned Single Judge. Substantial
relaxations have also been made by the authorities on
restrictions in the Covid-19 protocol. But we decided to address
legality of the orders under appeal for two reasons. First, the
impugned orders did not concern themselves with the
applicants for bail, but general directions were issued on the
Registry of the High Court and the police authorities. Secondly,
the respective orders in substance impacted operation of
legislative provisions giving right to an accused to apply for
bail, suspension of sentence and other aggrieved parties to
institute appeals under the Schedule Castes and Schedule
Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989. The “in rem”
character of these orders raise question of jurisdiction of the
learned Judge in passing such orders. The ultimate rejection
orders of the two bail applications also do not contain any
reference to the orders which are under appeal before us. The
appellant before us is the High Court of Rajasthan in both
these cases.
7.     The Rajasthan High Court had issued a notification
bearing NO. PA/RG/Misc/2020 dated 24.03.2020 at the onset
of the COVID-19 pandemic. Clause 1 (xiii) of the notification as
quoted in the order dated 31st March, 2020, reads:-
“It is made clear that on consideration of written
mentioning and written submissions, if any, the
relief as prayed for in urgent matters will be
considered and/or the matter shall be suitably
adjourned without passing any adverse orders….”
8.     In the order passed on 31st March, 2020, the learned
Single Judge opined that in the category of urgent matters,
even 2nd, 3rd and 4th Bail Applications were being filed as the
advocates/litigants were aware that no adverse order would be
passed. The reason for issuing the direction which we have
quoted above is that at that stage, the pandemic was having
devastating effect on large parts of this country. Guidelines
had been issued under the provision of Section 6 (2)(i) of the
Disaster Management Act, 2005 on 24th March, 2020 for
maintaining social distancing to prevent its spread. These
guidelines continued and subsequently have been varied from
time to time. The extension or variation of the guidelines are
not of much significance for deciding the questions involved in
these appeals.
9.     The    learned   Single   Judge    dealing   with  the  bail
application of Shahrukh was primarily concerned with
difficulties in effecting service of the notices in connection with
the cases which were being listed as “matters of extreme
urgency”. There was another factor which weighed with the
learned Single Judge for issuing such directions. It appears
that when the applications were moved, lawyers were
abstaining from professional work on account of call given by
the Bar Council of Rajasthan and because of this reason
complainants would have been deprived of their right to engage
a lawyer to oppose bail applications or applications for
suspension of sentence. The reasoning was summarized in
paragraphs 10 and 11 of the impugned order.
10.    In the order passed in S. B. Criminal Miscellaneous Bail
Application No. 3125 of 2021, the reasoning thereof would
appear from paragraphs 5 and 6. We have quoted these
paragraphs earlier in this judgment. The factors considered by
the learned Single Judge, ex-facie, were of administrative
concern.   Mr.   Vijay  Hansaria,     learned  Senior    Advocate
appearing for the High Court has based his submissions on two
main planks. His main argument is that decisions for listing of
matters by fixing the roster rest with the Chief Justice of a High
Court and such administrative power cannot be appropriated
by any Bench. The authorities on which reliance has been
placed by him in support of this argument are (1) State of
Rajasthan v. Prakash Chand & Ors. [(1998) 1 SCC 1), (2) High
Court of Judicature for Rajasthan v. Ramesh Chand Paliwal
& Another [(1998) 3 SCC 72] and (3) Campaign for Judicial
Accountability and Reforms v. Union of India & Anr. [(2018)
1 SCC 196]. He has also relied on decisions of this Court in
case of Asok Pande v. Supreme Court of India [(2018) 5 SCC
341] and Shanti Bhushan v. Supreme Court of India & Anr.
[(2018) 8 SCC 396) in support of the same proposition of law.
The    other  ground     of   grievance   of  the   High     Court
administration, the appellant before us, is that the impugned
orders were passed without giving any opportunity of hearing
to the High Court administration.
11.   In their reply affidavit to the appeal arising from the Order
passed on 17th May, 2021, the State, represented by Dr. Manish
Singhvi, learned Senior Advocate has taken a stand that the
issue of congestion in correctional homes has been addressed
to by this Court in an order passed on 7th May, 2021 in Suo
Motu Writ Petition (C) No. 1 of 2020. Strict implementation
of directions relating to arrests as contained in the case of
Arnesh Kumar v. State of Bihar and Anr. [(2014) 8 SCC 273]
has been mandated in this order. The said order of this Court
in Suo Motu Writ Petition (C) No. 1 of 2020 contains
observations and directions to the following effect:-
“10. Second, the rapid proliferation of the virus
amongst the inmates of congested prisons is a
matter of serious concern. The High-Powered
Committees      constituted     by     the     State
Governments/Union Territories shall consider
release of prisoners by adopting the guidelines
(such as inter alia, SOP laid down by NALSA)
followed by them last year, at the earliest. Such of
those states which have not constituted High
Powered Committees last year are directed to do so
immediately. Commissioner of Police Delhi shall
also be a member of the High-Powered Committee,
11. Third, due to the immediate concern of the
raging pandemic, this court has to address the
issue of de-congestion. We find merit in the
submission of Mr. Colin Gonsalaves, learned
Senior Counsel appearing on behalf of the
applicant, that the High-Powered Committee, in
addition to considering fresh release, should
forthwith release all the inmates who had been
released earlier pursuant to our order 23.03.2020,
by imposing appropriate conditions. Such an
exercise is mandated in order to save valuable time.
12. Fourth, further we direct that, those inmates
wo were granted parole, pursuant to our earlier
orders, should be again granted a parole for a
period of 90 days in order to tide over the
13. Fifth, the fight against the pandemic is greatly
benefitted by transparent administration. In this
regard, our attention was drawn to example of
Delhi, wherein the prison occupancy is updated in
websites. Such measures are required to be
considered by other States and should be adopted
as good practice. Moreover, all the decisions of
High-Powered Committees need to be published on
Governments/High Courts websites in order to
enable effective dissemination of information.
14. Overcrowding of prisons is a phenomenon,
plaguing several countries including India. Some
prisoners might not be willing to be released in view
of their social background and the fear of becoming
victims of the deadly virus. In such extraordinary
cases, the authorities are directed to be considerate
to the concerns of the inmates. The authorities are
directed to ensure that proper medical facilities are
provided to all prisoners who are imprisoned. The
spread of Covid-19 virus should be controlled in
the prisons by regular testing being done of the
prisoners but also the jail staff and immediate
treatment should be made available to the inmates
and the staff. It is necessary to maintain levels of
daily hygiene and sanitation required to be
improved. Suitable precautions shall be taken to
prevent the transmission of the deadly virus
amongst the inmates of prisons. Appropriate steps
shall be taken for transportation of the released
inmates of the prisons, if necessary, in view of the
curfews and lockdown in some States.”
12. The position of the Hon’ble Chief Justice for allocation of
business to the individual judges stand well established in the
light of the decisions in the cases of Prakash Chand (supra),
Campaign For Judicial Accountability and Reforms (supra),
Asok Pande (supra) and Shanti Bhushan (supra). Barring the
first judgment, the rest of these authorities outline the
administrative power of the Chief Justice of this Court under
Article 145 of the Constitution of India. But the pre-eminent
position of the Chief Justice of a High Court in fixing the roster
is no different. This issue has been highlighted in the case of
Prakash Chand (Supra). A Coordinate Bench of this court in
the case of Ramesh Chand Paliwal (Supra) underscores the
administrative power of the Chief Justice of a High Court
under Article 229 of the Constitution of India in dealing with
the subordinate staff.
13. In our view, orders under appeal passed on 31st March,
2020 and 17th May, 2021 encroached upon the administrative
power of the Chief Justice of the High Court of Rajasthan in
the matter of allocation of business to Hon’ble Judges of that
Court. It was also improper for the learned Single Judge to
come to a general finding that when there is complete
lockdown the bail applications, appeal under SC/ST Act and
applications for suspension of sentence in appeals and
revisions could not be considered to be matters of extreme
urgency.       Such     sweeping    orders  in  our   adversarial
adjudicatory system would be contrary to law as many persons
would be impacted by such orders without having any
knowledge of the proceeding. The orders were passed in
relation to criminal matters and would have had adverse effect
on those suffering or anticipating pre-trial detention or
convicts awaiting of their appeals. There could be individual
cases of extreme urgency for undertrial prisoners or convicts
also to apply for bail, upon suspension of sentence for the
latter category of litigants. In the impugned orders, the learned
Single Judge was in error in picking up the four categories of
litigations and arrive at a finding that these categories of cases
could not be considered to be of extreme urgency. It was also
not within his jurisdiction to direct the Registrar (Judicial) not
to list bail, appeals and applications for suspension of
sentence in Appeals and Revisions in the category of extreme
urgent matters.     In passing such order, the learned Single
Judge had assumed administrative jurisdiction of the Chief
Justice to allocate business to individual Judges of the Court.
Also, by issuing such sweeping directions, decision has been
taken which should have been left to be decided by the
respective Benches for determining as to whether the specific
cases fell in the category of extreme urgent matters warranting
listing, even during the pandemic.
14. Apart from this jurisdictional issue, on which we find the
learned Single Judge went beyond his allocated judicial
business, a blanket order prohibiting listing of bail application
or applications for suspension of sentence in appeals also
infringe upon the right of personal liberty of incarcerated
persons. Such right has been taken away by judicial order,
without compliance of procedure established by law, which in
our constitutional jurisprudence, is akin to “the due process”
dictum. Right to apply for bail is an individual right implicit in
Articles 14, 19 and 21 of the Constitution. The right of an
accused, an undertrial prisoner or a convicted person awaiting
appeal court’s verdict to seek bail on suspension of sentence
is recognized in Sections 439, 438 and 389 of the 1973 Code.
Similarly, the factors guiding appeal provision is contained in
the 1989 Act. If there is a blanket ban on listing of these
applications,   even   for  offences   with   lesser  degree    of
punishment, that would effectively block access for seekers of
liberty to apply for bail and in substance suspend the
Fundamental Rights of individuals in or apprehending
detention. Such an order also has the effect of temporarily
eclipsing statutory provisions.
15. In the case of Nikesh Tara Chand Shah v. Union of
India & Anr. [(2018) 11 SCC 1], a Coordinate Bench of this
Court traced the history and highlighted importance of bail
provisions in criminal jurisprudence, starting from Clause 39
of Magna Carta to the case of Gurbaksh Singh Sibbia v. State
of Punjab [(1980) 2 SCC 565]. It was, inter-alia, observed in
“In Gurbaksh Singh Sibbia v. State of Punjab [Gurbaksh
Singh Sibbia v. State of Punjab, (1980) 2 SCC 565 :
1980 SCC (Cri) 465] , the purpose of granting bail is set
out with great felicity as follows: (SCC pp. 586-88,
“27. It is not necessary to refer to decisions which deal
with the right to ordinary bail because that right does
not furnish an exact parallel to the right to anticipatory
bail. It is, however, interesting that as long back as in
1924 it was held by the High Court of Calcutta
in Nagendra Nath Chakravarti, In re [Nagendra Nath
Chakravarti, In re, 1923 SCC OnLine Cal 318 : AIR
1924 Cal 476 : 1924 Cri LJ 732] , AIR pp. 479-80 that
the object of bail is to secure the attendance of the
accused at the trial, that the proper test to be applied
in the solution of the question whether bail should be
granted or refused is whether it is probable that the
party will appear to take his trial and that it is
indisputable that bail is not to be withheld as a
punishment. In two other cases which, significantly,
are the “Meerut Conspiracy cases” observations are to
be found regarding the right to bail which deserve a
special mention. In K.N. Joglekar v. Emperor [K.N.
Joglekar v. Emperor, 1931 SCC OnLine All 60 : AIR
1931 All 504 : 1932 Cri LJ 94] it was observed, while
dealing with Section 498 which corresponds to the
present Section 439 of the Code, that it conferred upon
the Sessions Judge or the High Court wide powers to
grant bail which were not handicapped by the
restrictions in the preceding Section 497 which
corresponds to the present Section 437. It was
observed by the Court that there was no hard-and-fast
rule and no inflexible principle governing the exercise
of the discretion conferred by Section 498 and that the
only principle which was established was that the
discretion      should    be    exercised     judiciously.
In Emperor v. H.L.           Hutchinson [Emperor v. H.L.
356 : 1931 Cri LJ 1271] , AIR p. 358 it was said that it
was very unwise to make an attempt to lay down any
particular rules which will bind the High Court, having
regard to the fact that the legislature itself left the
discretion of the court unfettered. According to the
High Court, the variety of cases that may arise from
time to time cannot be safely classified and it is
dangerous to make an attempt to classify the cases
and to say that in particular classes a bail may be
granted but not in other classes. It was observed that
the principle to be deduced from the various Sections
in the Criminal Procedure Code was that grant of bail
is the rule and refusal is the exception. An accused
person who enjoys freedom is in a much better position
to look after his case and to properly defend himself
than if he were in custody. As a presumably innocent
person he is therefore entitled to freedom and every
opportunity to look after his own case. A presumably
innocent person must have his freedom to enable him
to establish his innocence.
28. Coming nearer home, it was observed by Krishna
Iyer, J., in Gudikanti Narasimhulu v. State [Gudikanti
Narasimhulu v. State, (1978) 1 SCC 240 : 1978 SCC
(Cri) 115] that: (SCC p. 242, para 1)
‘1. … the issue [of bail] is one of liberty, justice, public
safety and burden of the public treasury, all of which
insist that a developed jurisprudence of bail is integral
to a socially sensitised judicial process. … After all,
personal liberty of an accused or convict is
fundamental, suffering lawful eclipse only in terms of
“procedure established by law”. The last four words of
Article 21 are the life of that human right.’
29.      In Gurcharan        Singh v. State       (UT     of
Delhi) [Gurcharan Singh v. State (UT of Delhi), (1978) 1
SCC 118 : 1978 SCC (Cri) 41] it was observed by
Goswami, J., who spoke for the Court, that: (SCC p.
‘29. … There cannot be an inexorable formula in the
matter of granting bail. The facts and circumstances of
each case will govern the exercise of judicial discretion
30. In AMERICAN JURISPRUDENCE (2nd, Vol. 8, p. 806,
‘Where the granting of bail lies within the
discretion of the court, the granting or denial
is regulated, to a large extent, by the facts and
circumstances of each particular case. Since
the object of the detention or imprisonment of
the accused is to secure his appearance and
submission to the jurisdiction and the
judgment of the court, the primary inquiry is
whether a recognizance or bond would effect
It is thus clear that the question whether to
grant bail or not depends for its answer upon
a variety of circumstances, the cumulative
effect of which must enter into the judicial
verdict. Any one single circumstance cannot
be treated as of universal validity or as
necessarily justifying the grant or refusal of
bail…”
16. There was a hint of suggestion from learned Additional
Advocate    General     before     the    High    Court     for  passing
appropriate order so that the Director General of Police may
be informed to comply with the same.               But we can accept
neither the rationale nor the substantive parts of these
directives. The power to make arrest of persons lies with the
investigating agencies and the 1973 Code as well as other
statutory   instruments       have     laid   down      the   procedural
structure in which such power may be exercised. Moreover, in
the case of Arnesh Kumar (supra), this Court has laid down
certain methodology to be followed by the law enforcing
agencies while making arrest.
17.    We do not think in view of the comprehensive guidelines
contained in the case of Arnesh Kumar (supra) and Suo Motu
Writ Petition (C) No. 1 of 2020 (supra), there was any
necessity for the learned Single Judge to issue general
directives to which the subject of arrest of the applicants was
remotely involved. In the orders under appeal, the actual fate
of the plea of the applicants for bail was not addressed to.
18. We have already observed that since both the bail
applications were eventually rejected, we had considered the
course of disposing of these appeals as having become
infructuous. But we chose to labour on testing the correctness
and propriety of these orders as these contained general
directions going far beyond the lis forming subject–matter of
the two proceedings. The directions issued had the potential
for breaching the constitutional and legal rights of individuals
who could be or are arraigned in criminal action and also put
fetters on power of investigating agencies. Though the impact
of the orders under appeal no more survives, we decided to
express our opinion on the subject–controversy. With these
observations, we allow the appeals. As both the applications
for bail have been rejected, there is no necessity of formally
setting aside the orders under appeal.
