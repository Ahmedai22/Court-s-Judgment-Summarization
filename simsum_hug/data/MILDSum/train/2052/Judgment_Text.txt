Case :- CRIMINAL MISC. BAIL APPLICATION No. - 11290 of 2022
1. Heard Sri Upendra Upadhyay, learned counsel for the applicant as well
as S/Sri Ratnendu Kumar Singh and Rajesh Mishra, learned AGA and
perused the record.
2. The present application under Section 439 Cr.P.C. was filed on
4.10.2021 seeking bail in FIR/Case Crime No.160 of 2020, under Section
3(1) of the U.P. Gangster and Anti-social Activities (Prevention) Act,
3. Learned counsel for the accused-applicant submits that he has received
instructions to withdraw the present bail application without undertaking
that he would not file a fresh application seeking bail in the aforesaid case
crime number.
4. This Court is of the view that the accused-applicant wants to avoid this
Bench and, therefore, it has been prayed on behalf of the accused-
applicant to reject this bail application as withdrawn simplicitor as there is
no bar for filing subsequent bail application. Therefore, this Court would
like to proceed to decide the case on merit instead of rejecting the bail
application as withdrawn simplicitor.
5. The Supreme Court in the case of Fatehchand Himmatlal and others
vs State of Maharashtra and others, (1977) 2 SCC 670 has held that it is
important, by comity of the Bench and the Bar, to conserve judicial time
in the name of public justice.
6. The Supreme Court has time and again deprecated the practice of
bench-hunting, bench-hopping and bench-avoiding. In the case of
Subrata Roy Sahara Vs. Union of India and others, (2014) 8 SCC 470
has held that any act of bench-hunting, bench-hopping and bench-
avoiding cannot be allowed. The benchmark, that justice must not only
be done but should also appear to be done, has to be preserved at all
costs. Any attempt for bench-hunting, bench-hopping and bench-
avoiding needs to be strongly repulsed.
7. Allegation against the accused-applicant is that on 6.10.2020, the In-
charge Inspector, Swatantra Kumar Singh along with police team was on
patrol duty and was for look out of the wanted criminals and, therefore,
the vehicles etc. were being checked. During the patrol of the police
team, it was noticed an organised gang containing Rajendra Pasi alias
S/o Phoolchand, Rajesh Singh alias Rajan Singh S/o Late Ramvriksh
Yadav, Shyam Babu S/o Pasidh Pasi and Abhishek Mishra alias Deepu
Mishra S/o Lalji Mishra and other accused. The leader of the gang is the
present accused-applicant. The leader and members of the gang
committed heinous offences such as murder, abduction, extortion, loot
ransom etc. for their financial, economic and material benefits. Because
of the criminal activities such as murder etc. there remains a problem of
law and order. Because of the fear and terror of this gang, no one comes
forward to lodge a report at the police station and no one dares to give
evidence against any member of the gang. As this gang and leader is
involved in heinous cases such as murder etc., their freedom would not
be in the interest of public in general. The gang and its leader have been
committing the offences under Chapter 16, 17 and 22 of IPC and they
are habitual criminals.
8. On 6.2.2014 at around 1920 hours in Village Esa Kala Pokhre where
work was being conducted by a contractor through the workers, the gang
members came there and fired from the automatic weapons on the
workers, as a result thereof one worker, Ram Iqbal S/o Mohan died on
the spot. Pachu S/o Ramjatan got seriously injured and received several
fire arm injuries. This incident created an atmosphere of helter skelter.
People got scared and terrified. In respect of the said offence, Case
Crime No.20 of 2014, under Sections 147, 148, 149, 302, 307, 506
and120-B IPC and Section 7 Criminal Law Amendment Act was lodged
and after completion of the investigation, charge sheet no.24 dated
14.5.2014 and other charge sheets were filed. Gang chart was approved
by the District Magistrate.
9. Learned AGA has submitted that the accused-applicant is the most
dreaded criminal, gangster and one of the biggest bahubali of India.

10. This Court while rejecting the bail application of the accused-
applicant in Criminal Misc. Bail Application No.46494 of 2021 in Case
Crime No.185 of 2021, under Sections 419, 420, 467, 468, 471 and 120-
B IPC, Police Station Sarai Lakhansi, District Mau has said that the
accused-applicant is a notorious criminal, who is an image of ‘Robin
Hood’ in Northern India. He is harden and habitual offender, who has
been in sphere of crime since 1986, but he has managed not a single
conviction against him. He has more than 56 cases to his credit of
heinous nature and he could manage his affairs in such a way that he did
not receive a single conviction barring of two which have been rendered
recently. This Court said that it is slur and challenge to the judicial
system that such an dreaded and white collored criminal in the field of
crime is undefeated and unabetted.
11. This Court has taken note of the criminal cases registered against the
accused-applicant and said that the rich criminal horoscope of the
accused-applicant made him to be popular public figure and he gets
elected to Legislative Assembly for six consecutive times. It is a most
unfortunate and ugly face of our democracy where a person on one hand
facing almost two dozen sessions trials, but he gets elected by the public
as their representative for six consecutive times.
12. If the present accused-applicant is not a gangster, then in this country
no one can be said to be a gangster. He and his gang members
accumulated enormous wealth by striking fear and terror in the minds
and hearts of the people and his freedom would be peril of the law
abiding citizens of this Court.
13. The present offence was committed only with object to strike fear
that no one should dare to take contract except for the accused-applicant
or his gang members and, therefore, the members of the gang opened
indiscriminate fire from illegal automatic weapons on innocent workers,
which resulted into death of one person and injury to others in order to
strike fear and terror and give a message that one should not dare to take
contract work of the Government in his area.
14. Considering the allegations and the rich criminal horoscope of the
accused-applicant and also taking into consideration of the fact that in
most of the cases the accused-applicant could secure acquittal as the
witnesses turned hostile because of fear and terror or the witnesses got
eliminated and a criminal, gangster and bahubali, the accused-applicant
is not entitled to be enlarged on bail.
15. Bail application is accordingly rejected.
