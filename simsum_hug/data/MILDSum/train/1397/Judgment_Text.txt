These Writ Petitions have been instituted for a direction to appoint
the petitioners as Field Assistant (Trainee) pursuant to the results published
W.P.Nos.13321, 13324, 13325, 13327, 13328, 13329, 13330, 13335, 13343 and 13344 of 2022
based on the Notification No.1 of 2016 dated 28.02.2016 and as officially
there are 2,900 vacancies as per the Notification No.5 of 2020 dated
2.The learned Senior Counsel appearing on behalf of the writ
petitioners mainly contended that the petitioners, pursuant to the
notification issued in Notification No.1 of 2016 dated 28.02.2016,
participated in the process of selection for appointment to the post of Field
Assistant (Trainee). However, they did not fall within the zone of
consideration and were not appointed.                         Subsequently, thousands of
vacancies in the cadre of Field Assistant arose and the respondents have not
initiated any action to fill up those posts by providing an opportunity to the
persons who have participated in the selection during the year 2016.
3.The learned Senior Counsel articulated by stating that, several
Gangmen were appointed in the TANGEDCO, who were all utilized to
perform the duties of the Field Assistant and several accidents occurred and
the concerns raised in this regard are not addressed by the competent
authorities nor redressed. Thus, the actions of the respondents are not
W.P.Nos.13321, 13324, 13325, 13327, 13328, 13329, 13330, 13335, 13343 and 13344 of 2022
condonable and they are bound to consider all the candidates for
appointment to the post of Field Assistants, more specifically, with
reference to the selection conducted during the year 2016.
4.The learned Senior Counsel drew the attention of this Court with
reference to the news published and the information provided regarding
electrocution occurred due to the irregular actions of the respondents in
allotting the Gangmen to perform the duties attached to the post of Field
Assistant. These Gangmen are not qualified to perform the duties in the live
electric wires. Contrary to the job responsibilities alloted to these Gangmen,
they are made to perform other duties, which resulted in accidents.
5.The learned Senior Counsel drew the attention of this Court to the
Affidavit filed by the respondents before the High Court that they will not
engage the Gangmen for breakdown and other technical works. When such
an affidavit is filed before the High Court, the said affidavit is to be
honoured by the respondents. But they are going on engaging these
Gangmen for performing the duties and responsibilities attached to the post
of wiremen, electricians, etc., which is a greater public concern and
W.P.Nos.13321, 13324, 13325, 13327, 13328, 13329, 13330, 13335, 13343 and 13344 of 2022
therefore, the case of the writ petitioners are to be considered for
appointment to the post of Field Assistant (Trainee).
6.The learned counsel appearing for the respondents objected the
contentions raised by the petitioners by stating that the petitioners were not
within the zone of consideration in respect of selection of the year 2016 and
the selected candidates numbering 900 were already appointed pursuant to
the Notification No.1 of 2016 dated 28.02.2016. Thereafter, another
notification was issued on 19.03.2020 for filing up 2,900 vacancies in the
post of Field Assistant and the process of selection was discontinued on
account of Covid-19 situation. Recently, the Government enacted Act 14 of
2022 and accordingly, the Tamil Nadu Public Service Commission has to
recruit the candidates for appointment to the post of Field Assistant. Thus,
the Board cannot recruit immediately and they have to approach the Tamil
Nadu Public Service Commission for the purpose of selecting eligible
candidates for appointment to the post of Field Assistant. As far as the writ
petitioners are concerned, they participated in the process of selection and
as per their ranking, they were not falling within the zone of consideration
and accordingly, the selected 900 candidates were appointed and therefore,
W.P.Nos.13321, 13324, 13325, 13327, 13328, 13329, 13330, 13335, 13343 and 13344 of 2022
the writ petitions now filed after a lapse of six years is liable to be rejected.
7.The learned Senior counsel appearing on behalf of the petitioners
stated that, over and above the notified vacancies of 900, now after a lapse
of several years, the respondents have appointed some Field Assistants. The
said statement is disputed by the learned counsel for the respondents by
stating that, no appointments are made to the post of Field Assistants so far
and the recruitment notification issued in the year 2020 was also cancelled.
8.Undoubtedly, certain serious concerns raised by the learned Senior
counsel appearing on behalf of the writ petitioners are to be looked into by
the TANGEDCO Authorities. However, those concerns cannot be a reason
for granting the relief of appointment in favour of the writ petitioners. The
relief sought for and the right established are to be tested for the purpose
issuing a direction. In the present case, admittedly, the writ petitioners have
participated in the process of selection for the year 2016 and they were not
within the zone of consideration for appointment.
W.P.Nos.13321, 13324, 13325, 13327, 13328, 13329, 13330, 13335, 13343 and 13344 of 2022
9.This Court is of the considered opinion that appointment can never
be claimed as a matter of absolute right and appointments are to be made
strictly in accordance with the recruitment rules in force. Equal
opportunities in public employment is the Constitutional mandate. Thus,
whenever a decision is taken for recruitment, the competent authorities are
bound to follow the recruitment rules in force by providing equal
opportunities to all the candidates who all are aspiring for securing public
employment. Now, the process of selection to the post of Field Assistant is
to be conducted by the Tamil Nadu Public Service Commission. The
selection of the year 2016 cannot be considered now after a lapse of six
years, more specifically, for the purpose of issuing a direction to appoint the
writ petitioners as Field Assistants. That apart, the petitioners were not
selected and appointed pursuant to their participation during the year 2016.
Thus, the writ petitioners have not established any right for the purpose of
granting the relief of appointment to the post of Field Assistant, as
appointments are to be made in accordance with the recruitment rules in
force. The writ petitioners were not within the zone of consideration during
the year 2016 and the selected 900 persons were appointed and thereafter,
W.P.Nos.13321, 13324, 13325, 13327, 13328, 13329, 13330, 13335, 13343 and 13344 of 2022
no recruitment was conducted for the purpose of filling up the post of Field
10.It is needless to state that, public institutions are expected to act in
accordance with law in such circumstances where the Gangmen are utilized
to perform the duties of wiremen, electricians, etc. The concerns raised by
the learned Senior counsel is on public interest.
11.The petitioners are at liberty to participate in the process of
selection for appointment to the post of Field Assistant, if any notification is
issued by the competent selection authorities. With this liberty, these writ
petitions stand dismissed. No costs. Consequently, connected Writ
Miscellaneous Petitions are closed.
