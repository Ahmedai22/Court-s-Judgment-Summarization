1      The need for and importance of setting up facilities which cater to the need for
creating a safe and barrier free environment for recording the evidence of
vulnerable witnesses has engaged the attention of this Court over two decades. In
Sakshi v Union of India 1, this Court issued directions in addition to those which were
contained in the decision in State of Punjab v Gurmit Singh 2. The relevant extract
from the decision in Sakshi (supra) reads thus:
(1)    The provisions of sub-section (2) of Section 327 CrPC shall, in
addition to the offences mentioned in the sub-section, also
apply in inquiry or trial of offences under Sections 354 and
(2)    In holding trial of child sex abuse or rape:
(i)     a screen or some such arrangements may be made where
the victim or witnesses (who may be equally vulnerable like
the victim) do not see the body or face of the accused;
(ii)    the questions put in cross-examination on behalf of the
accused, insofar as they relate directly to the incident,
should be given in writing to the presiding officer of the
court who may put them to the victim or witnesses in a
language which is clear and is not embarrassing;
(iii)   the victim of child abuse or rape, while giving testimony in
court, should be allowed sufficient breaks as and when
required.”
2 More recently, in State of Maharashtra v Bandu @ Daulat 3, directions were issued by
this Court for setting up “special centres for examination of vulnerable witnesses” in
criminal cases so as to facilitate a conducive environment for recording the
statements of vulnerable witnesses. This Court dwelt on the guidelines which have
been issued by the High Court of Delhi for recording the evidence of vulnerable
witnesses in criminal matters and noted that special centres have been set up in
Delhi for that purpose. While observing that the direction of the High Court of Delhi
for setting up special centres for vulnerable witnesses is consistent with the earlier
decisions of this Court and supplement the principles which have been laid down,
this Court issued the following directions:
“12. […] all High Courts can adopt such guidelines if the same
have not yet been adopted with such modifications as may be
deemed necessary. Setting up of one centre for vulnerable
witnesses may be perhaps required almost in every district in the
country. All the High Courts may take appropriate steps in this
direction in due course in phases. At least two such centres in the
jurisdiction of each High Court may be set up within three months
from today. Thereafter, more such centres may be set up as per
decision of the High Courts.”
3 The fairness of the process of trial as well as the pursuit of substantive justice are
determined in a significant measure by the manner in which statements of
vulnerable witnesses are recorded. The dignity of person, which is an intrinsic
element of Article 21 of the Constitution, cannot be left to the vagaries of insensitive
procedures and a hostile environment. Access to justice mandates that positive
steps have to be adopted to create a barrier free environment. These barriers are
not only those which exist within the physical spaces of conventional courts but
those which operate on the minds and personality of vulnerable witnesses. There is a
pressing need to facilitate the salutary purpose underlying the creation of a barrier
free environment where depositions can be recorded freely without constraining
limitations, both physical and emotional. This requires not just the creation of
infrastructure but sensitizing all stakeholders.
4  This Court issued notice to all the High Courts in pursuance of which they have
appeared through Counsel. Based on the material which has been placed before
the Court, Ms Vibha Datta Makhija, amicus curiae, has prepared a tabulated
statement of the position of infrastructure in various High Courts as of 25 October
2021. A copy of the tabulated statement is annexed as a broad indicator at
Annexure ‘A’ to this order. Based on the deliberations which have taken place
during the course of proceedings in the Court, the suggestions which have been
proposed by the amicus curiae and the responses of some of the Counsel who
have appeared on behalf of the High Courts, the following directions are issued
under Article 142 of the Constitution in furtherance of the earlier decisions of this
Court. These are intended to facilitate the implementation of the directions which
were rendered on 24 October 2017 in Bandu (supra) and earlier in other decisions.
5 The directions are enumerated below:
(i)      The definition of “vulnerable witness” contained in Clause 3(a) of the
‘Guidelines for recording evidence of vulnerable witnesses in criminal
matters’ 4 of the High Court of Delhi shall not be limited only to child witnesses
who have attained the age of 18 years and should be expanded to include,
inter alia, the following categories of vulnerable witnesses:
(a)     Age neutral victims of sexual assault read with Sections 273 and 327 of
the Code of Criminal Procedure 1973 and Section 354 of the Indian
(b)     Gender neutral victims of sexual assault read with Section 2(d) of the
Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act 2012;
(c)     Age and gender neutral victims of sexual assault under Section 377 of
the Indian Penal Code 1860 read with paragraph 34(1) of the decision
in Sakshi (supra);
(d)     Witnesses suffering from “mental illness” as defined under Section 2(s)
of the Mental Healthcare Act 2017 read with Section 118 of the Indian
(e)     Any witness deemed to have a threat perception under the Witness
Protection Scheme 2018 of the Union Government as approved by this
Court in Mahender Chawla v Union of India 6;
(f)     Any speech or hearing impaired individual or a person suffering from
any other disability who is considered to be a vulnerable witness by the
competent court; and
http://delhihighcourt.nic.in/writereaddata/upload/notification/notificationfile_lcwcd2x4.pdf.
(g)     Any other witness deemed to be vulnerable by the concerned court.
(ii)  The High Courts shall adopt and notify a Vulnerable Witnesses Deposition
Centres 7 Scheme within a period of two months from the date of this order
unless a scheme is already notified. The High Courts which already have
existing VWDC Schemes in place may consider making suitable modifications
in conformity with the guidelines which are indicated in the present order. In
formulating the VWDC Scheme, the High Courts shall have due regard to the
scheme which has been formulated by the High Court of Delhi, which has
been duly approved in the judgment of this Court in Bandu (supra);
(iii) Every High Court should set up an in-house permanent VWDC Committee for
continuously supervising the implementation of the present directions and
making a periodic assessment of the number of VWDCs required in each
district proportionate to the time required for recording evidence of
vulnerable witnesses and to coordinate the conduct of periodic training
(iv)  Every High Court is requested to make an estimation of costs towards
manpower and infrastructure required to set up at least one permanent
VWDC in every establishment of the District Court (or additional Sessions Court
establishments) and estimate the optimal number of VWDCs required for the
entire State within a period of three months;
(v)   Having due regard to the importance of conducting periodic training
programmes for manning and managing the VWDCs and sensitizing all stake
holders, including judicial officers, members of the Bar and the staff of the
court establishment, we constitute a Committee chaired by Justice Ms Gita
Mittal, former Chief Justice of the Jammu and Kashmir High Court. The
Committee shall devise and implement an All India VWDC Training
Programme, besides engaging with the High Courts on the creation of
infrastructure for VWDCs. The initial tenure of the Chairperson shall be for a
period of two years.       All High Courts or concerned role assignees shall
facilitate and give full cooperation in conducting training programmes in
terms of the module which may be prepared by the Chairperson;
(vi)   Upon the estimation of costs prepared by the VWDC Committee of each
High Court, the State Government shall expeditiously sanction the requisite
funds within a period of three months from the date of the submission of the
proposal or the end of the financial year, whichever is earlier, and disburse
the funds to the High Court in accordance with the project plan. The State
Government shall nominate a nodal officer of the Finance Department who
shall be associated ex officio with the work of the VWDC Committee of the
High Court, to facilitate the implementation of the proposal submitted by the
High Court in terms of these directions;
(vii)  The High Courts shall ensure that at least one permanent VWDC is set up in
every District Court establishment (or additional Sessions Court establishments)
within a period of four months. The Registrars General of the High Courts shall
file compliance reports before this Court;
(viii) In many States, ADR Centres have been set up by the High Courts in close
proximity to the court establishments in the districts. Where such ADR Centres
are in place, the High Courts would be at liberty to ensure that the VWDC is
made available within the premises of the ADR Centre so as to secure a safe,
conducive and barrier free environment for recording the depositions of
vulnerable witnesses;
(ix) The National Legal Services Authority 8 as well as the State Legal Services
Authorities 9 have a vital stake and role, particularly in devising and
implementing sensitization and training programmes. The Chairperson of the
Committee appointed by this Court is requested to engage with NALSA and
SLSAs (subject to the directions which may be issued by the Hon’ble Executive
Chairperson of NALSA) so as to provide an effective interface for
implementing the scheme for training;
(x)  The Hon’ble Chief Justices of the High Courts would be at liberty to take all
appropriate steps either on the administrative side or on the judicial side in
furtherance of the present directions and to monitor compliance on a
(xi) The Chief Justice of the High Court of Delhi is requested to make available a
work space/room for the office of the VDWC Committee Training Centre and
requisite staff, preferably personnel who have previously assisted in the
development and implementation of the Training Modules of the Delhi High
Court and to designate a Coordinator of the programme in consultation with
the Chairperson.     Appropriate secretarial and logistical support staff and
equipment may be made available to the Committee on a reasonable
remuneration as fixed by the Chairperson.        The expenses in that regard,
including the honorarium payable to the Chairperson shall be defrayed      by
the Ministry of Women and Child Development to the Director of the Delhi
Judicial Academy. The Chairperson may fix a reasonable honorarium for the
work assigned to her under the terms of this order. In the event that any
further directions are necessary, the Chairperson may seek them before this
Court and any communication in that regard shall be placed for further
(xii)   The Ministry of Women and Child Development of the Union Government shall
designate a nodal officer for coordinating the implementation of these
directions and for providing all logistical support to Justice Ms Gita Mittal, the
Chairperson of the Committee appointed by this Court. This would include
the payment of honorarium to the Chairperson in terms as fixed by the
Chairperson and meeting the expenses, including those towards engaging
domain experts for training programmes. The Union Ministry of Women and
Child Development and all Ministries of Women and Child Development in
the States shall coordinate with the Chairperson and extend logistical support.
The High Courts shall, in consultation with the Chairperson of the Committee,
enlist experts in the field to facilitate proper training and development of all
stake holders.
6  A copy of this order shall be forwarded by the Secretary General of this Court to the
Secretary, Ministry of Women and Child Development of the Union Government and
to the Secretaries of the Ministries of Women and Child Development of all the State
Governments for compliance. A copy of this order shall also be emailed to Justice
Ms Gita Mittal for information and also to the Registrars General of all the High
Courts for implementation by the High Courts.
