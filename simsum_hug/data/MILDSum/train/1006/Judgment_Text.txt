1.     This is wife's appeal directed against the judgment and order dated
19.03.2020 passed by the Additional Principal Judge, Family Court,
Bareilly under Section 13 of the Hindu Marriage Act. The marriage of the
appellant with the respondent was held on 15.12.2013.
2.     The divorce petition had been filed by the respondent husband on
6.3.2017 on the ground that the appellant, his wife, had left her
matrimonial home on 10.1.2015 without any rhyme or reason, in his
absence, alongwith her family members. At that point of time, the
appellant wife was pregnant for two months. It was alleged in the divorce
petition that while leaving her matrimonial home, the appellant took all
her jewellery as also Rs.36,000/- in cash kept by the respondent in his
safe. On 25.1.2015, the respondent went to bring the appellant back to his
home when she refused to maintain any kind of relationship with him.
3.     It was further contended that on 22.8.2015, the appellant had given
birth to a girl child. She was admitted in the hospital by the respondent
who had borne all expenses of birth of his daughter. The appellant wife
went to her paternal home after birth of the child. After about eight to ten
days, the respondent went to bring the appellant back to his home when
she denied to meet him and did not allow him to even see his child. On
15.1.2017 the respondent again went alongwith his relative to bring the
appellant to his home when she had denied to accompany him. It is, thus,
stated in the divorce petition that the appellant was residing separately
since 10.1.2015 and she has refused to keep relationship with the
4. The plea in the divorce petition, thus, is that the appellant wife had
deserted her husband/respondent without any rhyme or reason and refused
to cohabit with him. The cause of action for filing the divorce petition
stated to have arisen on 10.1.2015 when appellant wife had left her
matrimonial home along with her father and brother and lastly on
15.1.2017 when she refused to accompany the respondent to her
matrimonial home. Another ground for seeking divorce is that the
appellant had refused to do the household work and misbehaved with the
family members of the respondent. She used to go to her paternal home or
to her relatives without any information to the respondent or his family
5.      The trial court had framed four issues; Issue nos. 1 and 2 framed by
the trial court read as under:
6.      In support of the averments in the divorce petition, the respondent
husband had produced five witnesses including himself as P.W-1. P.W-2
Amit Kapoor is brother of the respondent; P.W-3 is father-in-law of P.W.-2
Amit Kapoor and P.W-4 is neighbour of the respondent; P.W-5 is an
acquaintance. In rebuttal, appellant-wife entered in the witness box as
O.P.W-1 and her father Atar Singh as O.P.W-2.
7.      An application under Section 24 of the Hindu Marriage Act was
filed by the appellant on 6.9.2017 which was contested by the respondent
by filing his objection on 26.2.2018. By the order dated 10.7.2018, while
allowing the application under Section 24 of the Hindu Marriage Act, an
amount of Rs.5,000/- per month was awarded to the appellant and
Rs.2000/- for her daughter towards monthly maintenance. In addition to
the same, Rs.20,000/- in lumpsum was awarded towards the cost of the
8.      A written statement in rebuttal was filed by the appellant wife on
06.10.2018 wherein she had categorically denied the assertion that she
had left her matrimonial home on 10.1.2015 rather it was stated therein
that the appellant lived with the respondent, her husband, in his house
uptil July, 2016. A child was born out of the wedlock on 22.8.2015 in
Rashmi Goyal Hospital situated at Rampur Garden Bareilly. The appellant
was admitted in the hospital by the respondent on 22.8.2015 who had
signed the consent letter for the surgery. It is emphatically denied that the
appellant had refused to have sexual relationship with the respondent. It
was further stated that after the birth of the girl child the respondent did
not care to take the appellant to his home from the hospital and she had to
go to her father's home. After about a period of four months, the
respondent went to the house of the appellant's parents and when the
matter was amicably settled and the appellant came to live with the
respondent in his house. On 13.6.2016, their daughter had to undergo an
operation for which she was admitted in Medanta Medicity Hospital
Gurgaon when both the appellant and respondent were with their child.
After surgery, the appellant-wife came back to the house of the respondent
and stayed there until 21 July, 2016 when she was turned out of her
matrimonial home along with her infant daughter. It is alleged in the
written statement that the original documents such as Aadhar Card, Pan
Card, Driving licence, Voter Id, Marriage certificate and other documents
pertaining to the educational qualification of the appellant-wife were in
the possession of the respondent and he was misusing them by forging her
9.     An F.I.R under Section 498, 506 I.P.C and Â¾ of D.P Act was lodged
in P.S Prem Nagar Bareilly on 27.01.2018 by the appellant-wife against
the respondent in respect of which investigation was going on whereas
interim protection had been granted by this Court in a writ petition filed
by the respondent. It is denied by the appellant that she took her jewellery
while leaving the home of the respondent. It is also denied that the
respondent went to the house of the parents of the appellant on 25.1.2015.
10.    Some photographs have been filed by the appellant along with the
written statement to prove that she along with her daughter were living
alongwith the respondent. It was lastly stated that on 15.12.2015 marriage
of the brother of the respondent was solemnised wherein the appellant had
participated. Some of the photographs in which the appellant and
respondent could be seen with the wife of the elder brother of the
respondent were of the month, February, 2016. It is lastly stated that the
respondent had filed Income Tax Returns of the appellant by forging her
signature for the assesment year, 2013-14 till 2016-17.
11.    The contention of the appellant, thus, is that she was turned out of
her matrimonial home by the respondent on 21.7.2016 without any
reasonable cause and the respondent did not care for his wife and the
infant child.
12.    Noticing the pleadings of the parties, the evidence on record, in his
statement as P.W-1, the respondent has admitted factum of marriage
though denied the demand of dowry and stated that his wife/appellant
used to threatened him that she would implicate him in a false case of
dowry. The averment of desertion on the part of the wife as on 10.1.2015,
as stated in the divorce petition, has been reiterated in the examination-in-
chief. It was also stated that the appellant was admitted in the hospital by
the respondent during birth of their child and the respondent borne all the
expenditures therein. It was also admitted that during surgery of their
daughter on 13.6.2016 in Medanta Medicity Hospital, the appellant was
present. However, it is denied that at that point of time the appellant, his
wife, was living with him. The photographs marked as paper nos.30Ga/4,
30Ga/5, 30Ga/6, 30Ga/7, 30Ga/8, and 30Ga/9 were admitted by the
respondent. It was also admitted that the marriage of his brother on
15.12.2015 was attended by the appellant and the said date is also the
wedding anniversary of the appellant and the respondent. Paper no.20/14
is the photograph of 15.12.2015 which was the date of marriage of the
brother of the respondent, his own wedding anniversary. It is admitted that
in the said photograph, wife and daughter of the respondent could be seen
with him. Paper no.30Ga/10 is the photograph wherein the appellant,
respondent and brother and sister-in-law of the respondent could be seen
together. This document is also admitted. Other photographs marked as
paper no.30Ga/11, 30Ga/13, 30Ga/15, 30Ga/16, 30 Ga/17 and 30Ga/18
are also admitted to the appellant which are photographs of his daughter
with his parents. Paper no.30Ga/18 is the photograph which is admittedly
of the respondent and his wife, but he has refused to recognize the place
where it was taken.
13.    As noted above, it is pertinent to state here that in one of the
photographs paper no.30Ga/6, the respondent could be seen along with
his wife (appellant) and daughter. The respondent has admitted that the
said photograph was taken after birth of his daughter when she was about
four to five months. There are photographs of mother and daughter of the
respondent with him which are admitted though it is not specified by him
as to when and where those photographs were taken and what was the age
of his child at that point of time. One of the photographs marked as
30Ga/9 is of the drawing room of the house of the respondent where his
daughter, who was about 7-8 months old, could be seen on a walker. In
the cross examination, the respondent had categorically stated that his
brother Amit got married on 15.12.2015. In the marriage anniversary of
his brother which was on 15.12.2016, the appellant was not present. We
are surprised to note at this moment that the family court had recorded a
finding that the appellant had attended the wedding anniversary of his
brother-in-law on 15.12.2016 and the photograph paper no.30Ga/9 was of
the said function which was held in the house of the respondent. It is
difficult to understand as to what was the basis of the said finding.
14.    Contrary to this, the appellant in her statement before the family
court has categorically asserted that her parent's house and her
matrimonial house are located barely at a distance of 400 metres. Her
husband took her to the hospital when their child was born on 22.8.2015.
Paper no.30Ga/9 has been proved to be the photograph of her child which
was taken in the drawing room of the house of the respondent. Paper
no.30Ga/10 is the photograph of the appellant along with the respondent
and her sister-in-law and brother-in- law Amit Kapoor. This photograph
was stated to have been taken in the month of February, 2016 when they
went to attend a marriage in the family. Paper no.30Ga/11 is also the
photograph of the appellant and her sister-in-law (wife of Amit Kapoor-
brother of respondent). Paper no.30/12 is the photograph of the
respondent, his daughter alongwith his mother and was stated to have
been clicked in the drawing room of the house of the respondent. Paper
no.30Ga/14 is the photograph of their marriage anniversary on 15.12.2015
(which incidently was the date of marriage of brother of the respondent).
Paper no.30Ga/15 is the photograph of Amit Kapoor (brother of the
respondent), daughter of the appellant and mother of the respondent.
Paper no.30Ga/17 is the photograph which as per the statement of the
appellant is of their marriage anniversary which is also admitted to the
respondent as he stated that the said photograph was taken in the marriage
of his brother Amit wherein his wife could also be seen. Paper
no.30Ga/18 is the photograph wherein the appellant and respondent could
be seen together and it was stated by the appellant that the said
photograph was clicked in a Mall in Delhi on 14.2.2016 whereas the
respondent had refused to recognise the place where it was taken.
15.    The appellant in her statement has categorically stated that she was
kicked out of her matrimonial home on 21.7.2016 and the first
information report was lodged against the respondent thereafter. She was
confronted on the allegations of demand of dowry in the cross
examination. The appellant has asserted in cross that the marriage of her
brother-in-law was held after two years of their marriage on 15.12.2015,
and their marriage anniversary also fell on the said date. She had
reiterated that she remained in the house of the respondent till July, 2016
and at that point of time she was not pregnant. She had categorically
denied of leaving her matrimonial home in January, 2015.
16.    In support of the plea of desertion, the respondent has produced
other witnesses also. P.W-2 is the brother of the respondent namely Amit
Kapoor. He has stated that the appellant had left their home on 10.1.2015
alongwith her father saying that she would come back after few days. He
states that the father of the appellant remained in their house for around
30-45 minutes. In cross, he states that whatever has been stated in
paragraph-5 in his examination-in-chief with regard to the appellant
taking her jewellery and money while leaving on 10.1.2015, was based on
the information given to him by his brother, the respondent herein.
17.    P.W-3 is the father-in-law of P.W-2-Amit Kapoor. He states that he
was an acquaintance of the family of the respondent since, 2012 and in the
year 2015, the talk of marriage of his daughter with Amit Kapoor, brother
of the respondent, was going on. On 10.1.2015, he went to the house of
the respondent to invite them for his wedding anniversary. While he was
in the house of the respondent, father of the appellant came at around 6.00
p.m and took the appellant alongwith him. He then stated that on
25.1.2015 he along with the respondent went to the house of the appellant
to bring her back when she refused to come back with the respondent. In
cross, P.W-3 states that on 25.1.2015 he went to the house of the
respondent by chance and he was not called by the respondent. He then
stated that when P.W-1 respondent got his wife admitted for delivery, he
was informed by P.W-1 on telephone and he (P.W-3) also reached the
hospital when he came to know about the birth of their child.
18.     P.W-4 is a neighbour named as Ram Chandra Lal Srivastava whose
house is located in front of the house of the respondent. He states that he
saw the appellant leaving her matrimonial home alongwith her father
about five years back while he was standing outside his house. After that
he had never seen the appellant in her matrimonial house.
19.     P.W-5 namely Ashok Kumar Khanna is an acquaintance of the
respondent who stated that he knew the family since 2002. He states that
the appellant had left her matrimonial home in January, 2015 at around
6.30 p.m and he had seen her leaving. He further states that he knew
father of the appellant and had seen him going along with the appellant.
The statement in paragraph-'6' in the examination-in-chief of this witness
is verbatim the same as that of P.W-4 namely Ram Chandra Lal
Srivastava. P.W-5 also admitted in the cross that the statement in para-6 of
the examination in chief made by him was based on the information given
to him by P.W-4 namely Ram Chandra Lal Srivastava and this fact has not
been disclosed by him while making the said statement.
20.    On appreciation of the oral evidence led by the respondent husband,
at least, this can be elicited that P.W-3, P.W-4 and P.W-5 are the persons
who had no knowledge as to whether the appellant had actually left her
matrimonial home on 10.1.2015 with the intention to end her matrimonial
relationship. The statement of P.W-3 in this regard is not credible, in as
much as, he admitted that he was not related to the family on two crucial
dates, i.e. on 10.1.2015 and 25.1.2015. His statement that the appellant
had left her matrimonial home along with her father on 10.1.2015 and
refused to come back on 25.1.2015 when he also went along with the
respondent to bring her back, is sketchy. He seems to be either a chance
witness or brought up by the respondent. At least the statements of P.W-3,
P.W-4 and P.W-5 cannot be proof of desertion on the part of the appellant.
21.    We are left with two witnesses, i.e the respondent himself and his
brother Amit Kapoor. P.W.-2-Amit Kapoor was the resident of the same
house. He states that the appellant had left along with her father on
10.01.2015 saying that she would come back within few days. In the
examination in chief this witness states that his brother went to the house
of the appellant on 25.1.2015 but she refused to come back.
In cross, P.W-2 states that he brought the appellant back to his
house many a times but did not remember the exact number, though lastly
he brought her back in December, 2016. He further clarified that the
statement made by him in para-5 in examination-in-chief that the
appellant took his jewellery and cash alongwith her clothes while leaving
her matrimonial home on 10.1.2015 was based on the information given
by his brother/respondent.
22.    P.W.1, the respondent husband reiterated his averments in the
divorce petition by making statement in cross that the appellant had left
her matrimonial home on 10.1.2015 and after fifteen days, i.e 25.01.2015
he himself went to bring her back. She, however, refused to accompany
him. Their child was born in the hospital on 22.8.2015 and he got
admitted his wife in the hospital. For the treatment of his daughter, he
took her to Medanta Hospital Gurgaon and got her admitted therein on
13.06.2016. P.W-1 has, however, denied that his wife was residing with
him on 22.08.2015 and 13.06.2016. He also admits that the appellant
along with her daughter attended the marriage of his brother Amit
solemnized on 15.12.2015. In the cross examination, P.W-1 has denied
that the appellant had attended the marriage anniversary of his younger
brother Amit on 15.12.2016. The photographs shown to P.W-1 had been
admitted being of himself, his family and his daughter alongwith the
23.     A perusal of this part of statement of P.W.-1 indicates that the
photographs of his daughter uptil the age of 7-8 months were taken at
different point of time and location and some in his house also. In one of
these photographs, the child could be seen in the walker in a room of the
house of the respondent. P.W.-1 admitted the photograph marked as paper
no.30Ga/9 which is of his daughter when she was aged about 7-8 months
at that point of time. On appreciation of the statement of P.W-1/husband,
it is evident that the appellant and her daughter were well photographed in
the house of the respondent, i.e the matrimonial home of the appellant. In
various photographs, P.W.-1 himself could be seen alongwith his daughter
in his own house. There is a categorical statement of the appellant O.P.W-
1 that she was residing in her matrimonial house both at the time of birth
of her daughter and her treatment in Medanta Medicity Hospital Gurgaon
and thereafter till July, 2016. The distance between two houses, i.e
paternal home of the appellant and her matrimonial house (the
respondent's home) is barely 400 metres.        In these circumstance, the
statement of P.W.-1 that the appellant had deserted him by leaving her
matrimonial home on 10.01.2015, in his absence, permanently is
unbelievable. There is admission of the respondent/P.W-1 that his wife
though attended the wedding of his younger brother Amit on 15.12.2015
but was not present in his marriage anniversary on 15.12.2016. The
statement of P.W-2 in the cross examination that he went to bring the
appellant back many a times and lastly brought her back in December,
2016, also shows that the appellant came to her matrimonial home at least
24.            From the evidence on record, thus, it cannot be accepted that the
appellant had left her matrimonial home on 10.01.2015 with the intention
to end her matrimonial relationship. The statement of appellant O.P.W-1
that she came back to her matrimonial home after four months of birth of
her daughter when the respondent himself brought her back and remained
there till July, 2016 is found to be more convincing. The plea of desertion
on the part of the appellant without any reasonable cause and denial of
matrimonial obligation on her part, therefore, is not found proved.
25.             While recording finding on the issue no.2 of desertion, the Family
Court has recorded that the appellant could not explain as to how and why
she attended the wedding anniversary of her brother-in-law on 15.12.2016
when she was thrown out of her matrimonial home by her husband on
21.07.2016. The findings returned by the trial court on the issue of
26.            This finding of the Family Court is against the evidence on record,
the categorical statement of the respondent P.W.1 that her wife did not
attend the wedding anniversary of his younger brother Amit on
15.12.2016. It seems that the Family court has misread the statement of
27.    As regards the legal position, on the issue of desertion, the Apex
Court in Savitri Pandey vs Prem Chandra Pandey reported in
(2002) 2 SCC 73 considering its earlier decisions has held that the
desertion in its essence means the intentional permanent forsaking and
abandonment of one spouse by other without that other's consent, and
without reasonable cause. To constitute the offence of desertion so far as
the deserting spouse is concerned, two essential conditions must be there:
(i)the factum of separation.
(ii)the intention to bring cohabitation permanently to end (animus
deserendi).
28.    Similarly two elements are essential so far as the deserted spouse is
(1)     the absence of consent, and
(2)     absence of conduct giving reasonable cause to the spouse leaving the
matrimonial home to form necessary intention aforesaid.
29.    It was held that for holding desertion as proved the inference may
be drawn from certain facts viewing them as to the purpose which is
revealed by those acts or by conduct and expression of intention, both
anterior and subsequent to the actual acts of desertion. Desertion may also
be constructive which can be inferred from attending circumstances. It has
also always to be kept in mind that the question of desertion is a matter of
inference to be drawn from the facts and circumstances of each case.
30.    In the instant case, from the act and conduct of the parties, it cannot
be inferred that the appellant had deserted her husband (respondent) with
the intention to bring cohabitation permanently to an end by leaving her
matrimonial home on 10.01.2015 in the absence of her husband. The
appellant was pregnant at that time and she may have gone to her parents
house which was barely 400 metres, for sometime. Further, the act of the
appellant in visiting her parents house frequently without taking consent
of her husband and other family members cannot constitute the offence of
desertion on her part. P.W-2, brother-in-law of the appellant had stated
that he brought her back many a times from her parents house and lastly
she came in December, 2016. The plea of desertion taken by the
respondent can not be accepted from the facts and circumstances of the
case, in as much as, such an inference cannot be drawn from the attending
circumstances which speak otherwise. It may be inferred that there were
differences between husband and wife but the act of desertion, without
reasonable cause, with the intention to bring cohabitation permanently to
end is not proved, at least not on 10.01.2015. The cause of action as
alleged to have been accured firstly on 10.01.2015 and lastly on
15.01.2017, the period of two years of desertion, is not proved from the
material on record.
31.    Further, the appellant has come out with the categorical statement
that she alongwith her daughter was thrown out of her matrimonial home
by the respondent in July, 2016. The respondent admittedly did not bring
any legal action with a view to assert his right to restitute his conjugal
rights. When application under Section 24 of the Hindu Marriage Act was
filed, the respondent contested the same on various pleas and did not
come forward to pay interim maintenance even for his daughter. In this
appeal, the respondent did not appear in spite of filing of the caveat
application and service of the notice upon him, on account of which the
status quo order was passed on 05.10.2020. The respondent or his counsel
never participated in this proceeding which shows that the respondent
husband himself is not willing to take care of his wife and even his minor
daughter. It seems that he has deserted her wife on his own and is running
away from his responsibility of a father towards his minor daughter.
32.    For the above discussion, the findings returned by the Family Court
on issue no.2 that the appellant had deserted her husband without any
reasonable cause from 10.01.2015 and further on 15.01.2017 deserve to
be set aside.
33.   On the issue no.1 of cruelty, the Family Court has returned the
34.    The conclusion drawn by the trial court is that the appellant used to
go her parent's house without any information to the respondent or his
family members and she did not do daily chores of the house being a
daughter-in-law. We may record that not a single instance of such an act
of the appellant has been brought on record either by the respondent or
his brother who entered in the witness box as P.W-2. The general
allegations and casual statement of the respondent in the divorce petition
has been treated as a gospel truth by the Family Court without any cogent
evidence on record. The act of the appellant in visiting her parent's house,
in any case, even without the permission of the respondent does not
amount to cruelty. The facts that the appellant was admitted in the
hospital by the respondent at the time of her delivery or he had borne
expenses for treatment of their daughter do not go against the appellant
rather these facts support the case of the appellant that she did not leave
her husband that too permanently with the intention of bringing the
cohabitation to an end and has never done any act to deprive the
respondent from the pleasure of fatherhood. The ground of cruelty on the
said assertion is not made out.
35.    Last ground to hold cruelty on the part of the appellant is that she
had lodged a criminal case against her husband and in-laws on the false
plea of demand of dowry and her statement that she was thrown out of
her matrimonial house by the respondent by beating her is false. The
Family Court while recording the said finding has completely ignored the
fact that the first information report was lodged by the appellant on
27.01.2018 much after the divorce petition was instituted on 6.3.2017.
The act of the appellant in lodging the first information report on the plea
of demand of dowry may not be approved by the Family Court but the
said issue was not subject matter of scrutiny in the divorce proceeding.
Surprisingly, the family court has lost sight of the fact that the plea of
cruelty was taken as a ground of divorce in the plaint filed on 06.03.2017.
The plaintiff, i.e the respondent herein was required to prove the
existence of such acts or conduct of the appellant which amounted to
cruelty prior to the date of institution of the divorce suit. Any subsequent
conduct of the appellant in lodging the first information report after she
was thrown away from her matrimonial home by the respondent cannot
be treated as an act of cruelty on the part of the appellant.
36.    The respondent husband could not prove cruelty from any act or
conduct or behaviour of the appellant by leading any evidence much less
cogent evidence. The findings on issue no.1 on the plea of cruelty
returned by the family court are, thus, liable to be set aside.
37.   For the foregoing discussion and reasons, the divorce decree
granted by the trial court cannot be sustained in the eye of law. The
judgment and order dated 19.03.2020 passed by the Additional Principal
Judge, Family Court Bareilly is hereby set aside.
38.   The divorce petition no.284 of 2017 (Sumit Kapoor vs Smti Mohit
Preet Kapoor) under Section 13(1) of the Hindu Marriage Act is
dismissed as such.
39.    However, before parting with this judgment, we would like to
address one more issue which is of maintenance to wife and daughter
deserted by the respondent.
40.    It is evident from the record that the appellant got interim
maintenance under Section 24, pursuant to the order dated 10.07.2018
whereby Rs.5,000/- was fixed for the appellant and Rs.2,000/- for her
daughter on monthly basis by the Family Court. After dismissal of the
divorce suit on 19.03.2020, the interim maintenance has been stopped.
41.    While admitting this appeal and passing the interim order of status
quo, this Court did not clarify that interim maintenance would payable to
the appellant and her daughter. The result is that during the pendency of
the appeal, the appellant and her daughter have been left to survive on
their own. They have no financial support as the appellant has no income.
The question is as to whether after dismissal of the divorce suit, the
appellant is entitled for maintenance while living separately in case her
husband refuses to maintain her. This issue can be answered with the help
of the provisions contained in Section 18 of the Hindu Adoption and
Maintenance Act, 1956 which provides that a Hindu wife shall be entitled
to live separately from her husband without forfeiting her claim for
maintenance, in case her husband is guilty of desertion or abandoning her
without reasonable cause or is guilty of willfully neglecting her. The right
to claim interim maintenance by instituting a suit under Section 18 of the
Hindu Adoption And Maintenance Act, 1956 is a substantive right and can
be availed by the appellant by bringing her own action.
42.    However, as to the dependant daughter, who is aged about six years,
the obligation is upon the respondent by virtue of Section 20 of the Hindu
Adoption and Maintenance Act, 1956. The appellant needs money to
provide education, clothing, food and participation in extra curricular
activities for the upbringing of her daughter. The meagre amount of
maintenance of Rs.2,000/- per month for the minor daughter as fixed by
the Family Court has also been stopped since the year, 2020 after the
decree of divorce was passed in favour of the respondent.
43.    Considering the fact that the respondent is a Chartered Accountant
and is engaged in this profession since the year 2012, we find it fit and
proper that an amount of Rs.30,000/- per month shall be paid by the
