This appeal is filed against the impugned interim
order dated 02.06.2022 passed by the High Court of Delhi
in LPA No.362 of 2022 and Civil Miscellaneous Application
No.25664 of 2022 by which the       Division Bench of the     High
Court has restrained the appellant from            continuing as
Secretary  of   All  India   Chess    Federation.   The   original
respondent No.3 before the High Court has preferred            the
present appeal.
One  of   the   grievances,    which   is  voiced    in  the
present  appeal   is   that,  without    giving  any   sufficient
opportunity   either   to  the    appellant   or  to   the   Union
Government,  the   Division   Bench    has passed   the   impugned
order in haste.    It is also submitted that the main         writ
petition before the learned Single Judge which, according
to the appellant, is not maintainable,        is pending and yet
to  be   considered    by   the  learned     Single   Judge.    It  is
further submitted that as such the learned Single Judge
rejected   the   prayer    for  interim     relief   at   that   stage
awaiting the further affidavit to be filed on behalf of
the Union of India and the question in respect of interim
injunction was yet to be considered by the learned single
On the other hand, learned counsel appearing for the
contesting    respondent-original        appellant    has   submitted
that   in   the   facts     of   the     present   case    and      on
interpretation of relevant provisions of the Federation
and the manner in which the election was conducted                 and
the   appellant    was    elected     as   the   Secretary    of   the
Federation,    the Division Bench of the High Court has not
committed any error in granting the injunction and passing
the impugned order.
Having heard the learned counsel appearing for the
respective parties, we dispose of the present appeal in
terms of the following order:
(1)  Let the Union of India and the appellant file a
detailed affidavit before the Division Bench of the High
Court in LPA No.362 of 2022        within a period of four weeks
from today.
(2) Thereafter, the Division Bench of the High Court
shall     pass  a  fresh    order   including    the   grant   of  any
interim   order   after    giving    an   opportunity    to  all   the
concerned within a period of four weeks thereafter.
(3)   As it is reported that the Nation is holding a
prestigious Chess Olympiad    in the Country from 28.07.2022
to 10.08.2022 and to see the same be not affected further
in any manner,    we direct the appellant to be continued as
a Secretary of the Federation till 15.08.2022 by way of
interim   arrangement   only.   However,   the   same   shall   be
without prejudice to the rights and contentions of the
respective parties in the pending appeal       and pending writ
petition before the High Court, and subject to further
orders that may be passed by the Division          Bench in the
pending  LPA   No.362  of  2022   within  the   time   stipulated
hereinabove and/or the order that may be passed by the
learned Single Judge.
With   these   observations,    the   present    appeal   is
disposed of.
