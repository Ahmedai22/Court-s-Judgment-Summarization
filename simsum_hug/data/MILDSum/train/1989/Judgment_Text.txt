Challenging the premature release of 13 life convicts, by the State Government
in exercise of its power conferred under Article 161 of the Constitution of India, two
writ petitions (W.P.(MD)No.24324 of 2019 and W.P.(MD)No.25333 of 2019) filed by
W.P.(MD)Nos.24324 & 25333 of 2019 and 3431 of 2020
two different persons as public interest litigants and one petition by the relatives of
the victims who died in the violence. All the three writ petitions are taken up for
consideration together by consent.
2. It is pertinent and relevant to record at this juncture that six members of the
victims' family filed W.M.P.(MD)No.1643 of 2020 in W.P.(MD)No.25333 of 2019, to
get themselves impleaded in the public interest writ filed by Balachandra Bose @
Ulaganambi, a Political Leader claiming himself interested in the case as a public.
The Impleading Petition filed by the representatives of the victims to get themselves
impleaded in W.P.(MD)No.25333 of 2019. They questioned the locus of the writ
petitioner namely, Balachandra Bose @ Ulaganambi and also termed him as a busy
body.       Certain allegations were made specifically against Balachandra Bose @
Ulaganambi and the leader of his party for misleading them.                 For the sake of
completion, W.M.P.(MD)No.1643 of 2020 is allowed though impleading them is
only superfluous exercise in the light of the fact that the impleading petitioners have
filed separate Writ Petition in W.P.(MD)No.3431 of 2020 subsequently.
3. Melavalavu Village Panchayat in Melur Taluk, Madurai District, was a
General constituency till 1996. When the Government of Tamil Nadu notified it as a
constituency exclusively reserved for the members of Scheduled Caste, resentment
W.P.(MD)Nos.24324 & 25333 of 2019 and 3431 of 2020
from the other communities surfaced resulting in violent protest. After intervention
by the State machineries, election date was fixed as 09.10.1996. Though few
members of the Schedule Caste filed their nominations, they withdrew their
nominations fearing danger to life. Again, the date for election fixed as 10.12.1996,
but met with the same fate and got cancelled since the candidates again withdrew
their nominations. For the third time, the election date was fixed as 28.12.1996.
Though after much persuasions, the nominations were not withdrawn, but, on the
date of election, there was rioting and booth capturing, leading to postponement of
the election to 31.12.1996. At last, the election held on 31.12.1996. One Murugesan
was declared elected as President and One Mookan was declared elected as Vice-
4. Nearly six months thereafter, on 20.06.1997 when Murugesan and Mookan
with others were proceeding in a private bus, a gang of about 40 persons armed with
lethal weapon, stopped the bus and brutally attacked the occupants. In the said
attack, 6 persons, including Murugesan and Mookan died while several others were
injured. All the victims belongs to Schedule Caste.
5. The jurisdictional Police registered the case under Sections 120-B, 147, 148,
341, 307 and 302 IPC and Section 3(2)(v) of the SC and ST (POA) Act, 1989. On
completion of investigation, two final reports filed. Later, as per the direction of the
W.P.(MD)Nos.24324 & 25333 of 2019 and 3431 of 2020
High Court, both cases were clubbed and tried by the Sessions Court at Salem in S.C.
No.10 of 2001.       The trial Court, vide its judgment dated 26.07.2001, acquitted 23
accused from all charges and convicted 17 for offences under Section 302 r/w 34 IPC
and sentenced them to undergo life imprisonment. All the accused were acquitted
from the charges under SC & ST (POA) Act. Further, appeals to the High Court and
then to Supreme Court by the convicts were dismissed on 19.04.2006 and
22.10.2009 respectively. The Criminal Revision Petitions filed on behalf of the
victims against the order of acquittal of 23 accused from murder charge and all the
accused from charges under the SC & ST (POA) Act, were dismissed by the High
Court and no further appeal was filed before the Supreme Court challenging the
acquittal.
6. The 17 life convicts were sent to prison and one among them died in prison
due to illness. Out of the remaining 16 convicts, in the year 2008, three were
released pre-maturely, vide G.O.Ms.No.1155, Home Department, dated 11.09.2008.
Subsequently, the remaining 13 convicts were ordered to be released, vide
G.O.Ms.Nos.603 to 615 , Home ( Prison IV) Department, dated 08.11.2019, pursuant
to the decision taken by the State Government to grant amnesty to life convicts
completed 10 years of imprisonment to commemorate the Birth Centenary of Bharat
Ratna Puratchi Thalaivar Dr.M.G.Ramachandran, subject to Prison Rules.
W.P.(MD)Nos.24324 & 25333 of 2019 and 3431 of 2020
7. When this came to the knowledge of Mr.P.Rathinam, a practising Advocate,
known for espousing the cause of downtrodden, filed W.P.(MD)No.24324 of 2019 as
party-in-person, to issue Mandamus to the respondents, to furnish the copies of the
G.O.Ms.Nos.603 to 615, dated 08.11.2019. Later, he amended his prayer to issue a
Writ of Certiorarified Mandamus and quash the said G.Os. The beneficiaries of these
G.Os were also later, impleaded as respondents 4 to 16.
8. With similar prayer, viz., to quash the G.Os. leading to premature release of
the 13 life convicts accused in the Melavalavu massacre, Balachandra Bose @
Ulaganambi, a leader of a Political Party, preferred W.P.(MD)No.25333 of 2019.
These two public interest writ petitions were followed by W.P.(MD)No.3431 of
2020, filed by the family members of the victims.
Case of the writ petitioners:-
9. The grounds for challenging the premature release of the life convicts in all
these three writ petitions are almost similar and therefore, they are taken up for
consideration together. For brevity, the grounds are capsulated as below:-
The impugned order of premature release is arbitrary, irrational and
discriminatory.
(i) One of the convicts, by name Ramar, a beneficiary of G.O.Ms.No.613 was
earlier convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment for committing double murder
W.P.(MD)Nos.24324 & 25333 of 2019 and 3431 of 2020
of members belonging to Schedule Caste. Pending trial of the earlier case, he
committed the present crime and found guilty. The antecedent of this convict
disentitle him to get the benefit of the remission G.O.Ms.No.64, dated 01.02.2018.
However, ignoring the said fact, 13 life convicts were released prematurely without
considering the relevant materials need to be considered.
(ii) Though the accused were acquitted of the charges under the provisions of
SC & ST (POA) Act, 1989, the Division Bench of the High Court while confirming
the conviction for offences under Section 302 r/w 34 of IPC, had observed that, even
in respect of charge under Section 3(2)(v) of SC & ST (POA) Act, there is enough
material to hold against the accused persons, but unfortunately the State has not
preferred appeal against the acquittal. This observation not been taken note before
passing the impugned G.Os. Therefore, the life convicts are not entitled for
premature release.
(iii) The Melavalavu Village is prone for caste discrimination and leaching
violence against the SC Members. Numerous cases registered under the SC & ST
(POA) Act, 1989 in the Melavalvu Police Station in the past would show that the
premature release of these convicts is not conducive for the peace, tranquillity and
safety of the oppressed class. Without considering the safety of the victims family,
the State has exercised its power to release them prematurely without application of
mind.
W.P.(MD)Nos.24324 & 25333 of 2019 and 3431 of 2020
(iv) Before passing the impugned G.Os., the State has failed to follow the
procedure laid under law and the G.Os. silent about the reasoning, thus, suffers
arbitrariness.
10. The State as well as the beneficiaries of the impugned G.Os. were served
and represented through Counsels. On behalf of Mr.P.Rathinam, who preferred Writ
Petition(MD)No.24324 of 2019 as party-in-person, on instruction from the petitioner
Mr.T.Lajapathi Roy, learned Senior Counsel appeared and lead the submissions in
support of the writ petitioners and placed reasons why the impugned G.Os. are
unstainable in law.
11. On behalf of the State, Mr.N.R.Ilango, learned Senior Counsel and on
behalf        of    victims  Mr.V.Karthick,   learned  Senior   Counsel,     assisted    by
Mr.M.Jegadeesh Pandian; and              S.Kanagarajan and Mr.Y.Jagadesh lead the
submissions in support of the impugned G.Os.
12. Even before adverting to the merits of the rival submissions, it is essential
to understand the law of the land governing premature release of the prisoners by the
State exercising its power under Article 161 of the Constitution. Hence, the law and
dictum laid by the Apex Court, which are relevant is extracted below:-
W.P.(MD)Nos.24324 & 25333 of 2019 and 3431 of 2020
''161.Power of Governor to grant pardons, etc, and to
suspend, remit or commute sentences in certain cases.- The
Governor of a State shall have the power to grant pardons,
reprieves, respites or remissions of punishment or to suspend,
remit or commute the sentence of any person convicted of any
offence against any law relating to a matter to which the
executive power of the State extends.''
13. In exercise of the power conferred under Article 161, the Governor of
Tamil Nadu through the Home Department of the State, issued G.O.Ms.No.64, dated
01.02.2018, wherein a scheme was framed for considering the cases of premature
release of convicted prisoners on the occasion of the birth centenary of Shri.
M.G.Ramachandran, former Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu.
14. Following the above said G.O., the State issued G.O.Ms.No.302, Home
(Prison-IV) Department, dated 03.05.2018, wherein guidelines were issued in tune
with the Supreme Court judgments rendered in Epuru Sudhakar and others vs.
Government of A.P. and others [2006 (8) SCC 161]; Maru Ram and others vs.
Union of India [AIR 1980 SC 2147]; and Union of India vs. Sriharan @
Murugan [2016 (7) SCC 1]. The said guidelines restricted the benefit to any life
convicts, who have completed 10 years of actual imprisonment as on 25.02.2018 and
those life convicts, who were aged above 60 years and completed 5 years of actual
W.P.(MD)Nos.24324 & 25333 of 2019 and 3431 of 2020
imprisonment on 25.02.2018, including those who were originally sentenced to death
by the trial Court and modified to life sentence by the Appellate Court (other than
those whose convictions have been commuted).
15. The Scheme framed under G.O.Ms.No.64, dated 01.02.2018 and the
guidelines under G.O.Ms.No.302, dated 03.05.2018, read as follows:-

shall not be extended later on to the persons who fulfill all the
conditions stipulated in the Government Orders on a later date.
(VIII) The life imprisonment prisoners cannot claim
premature release as a matter of right."
16. The case of the 13 life convicts, who are arrayed as respondents in these
three Writ Petitions were positively considered for premature release. G.Os. were
passed individually for each of the convict and they all were released.
17. The learned counsel appearing for the writ petitioners assail the G.Os.
claiming that, except a vague references about the two committees constituted for the
premature release and the proposal of the Additional Director General of Police/I.G.
of Prisons, the G.O. does not discloses the content of the recommendations of the
two committees or the proposal of the I.G. of Prisons, therefore, the decision of
premature release suffers non application of mind.
18. In counter to this submission, Mr.N.R.Ilango, learned Senior Counsel
W.P.(MD)Nos.24324 & 25333 of 2019 and 3431 of 2020
representing the State submitted that these 13 life convicts were released prematurely
in accordance with the procedure laid and the G.O. indicates about the process and
material considered. The details of the recommendations or proposal deed not
necessarily be stated in detail while recording the satisfaction. The circulation file
pertaining to the respective G.O. contains the process undergone before passing the
G.O. and it will speak about the application of mind before passing the G.O. The
learned Senior Counsel also submitted that out of 17 persons convicted for life in
this case, one died in the prison due to illness. Three of them were positively
considered for premature release in the light of G.O.Ms.No.1155, Home (Prison (IV)
Department, dated 11.09.2008, issued in commemoration of Birth Centenary of
Peraringar Anna. The release of these three life convicts namely Alagarsamy,
Markandan and Rasam @ Ayyavu prematurely did not create any law and order
problem in Melavalavu Village nor objected by the victims family. Subsequently,
nearly after 10 years when the State took a policy decision to grant remission to life
convicts in view of the Birth Centenary of Late Dr.M.G.Ramachandran, former Chief
Minister of Tamil Nadu, about 1636 life convicts were found eligible for premature
release. They were considered case to case basis by the District Level Committees
and the State Level Committee. Based on their recommendations, independently
decision to release them were taken by the State and G.Os. Passed.
19. As far as the cases of the private respondents in these Writ Petitions are
W.P.(MD)Nos.24324 & 25333 of 2019 and 3431 of 2020
concerned, initially, the District Level Committee did recommend for their premature
release. However, the State Level Committee did not recommend for their premature
release, apprehending possibility of communal clash again in the Village. Later,
representations were received on behalf of the life convicts and by a Member of the
Legislative Assembly. Objections were also received opposing any consideration for
premature release. After due consideration of the rival representation, realising that
the State Committee earlier has not taken note of the premature release of three co-
convicts, who were convicted for life along with these 13 convicts in the same case
and no report of communal clash at Melavalavu Village consequent to their release,
the State Committee re-examined the file taking note of the facts which were omitted
to be considered while rejecting the case of these life convicts.
20. Thereafter, considering the report of the Probation Officer, the
representation made on the victims side, the prevalence of the law and order during
the leave period of the said 13 prisoners, the impact of the premature release of the 3
co-accused/convicts recommended for premature release. This proposal              of the
Second Level/District Committee was re-examined by the State Level Committee
headed by the Inspector General of Prisons. Based on the proposals, the premature
release of these 13 life convicts were considered by the State and orders issued.
21. The files in connection with the issuance of G.Os. were produced for
scrutiny and same perused by the Court. On examination of the files, which have
W.P.(MD)Nos.24324 & 25333 of 2019 and 3431 of 2020
originated by the Home Department of the State based on recommendations of the
Committees, has been circulated upto the Governor of the State, contains all
particulars necessary for taking the decision. The content of the file is in tune with
the submission of the learned Senior Counsel Mr.N.R.Ilango. This Court is satisfied
that the premature release of these 13 life convicts has undergone the procedure laid
under law and was issued based on subjective satisfaction of the Government.
22. The point now for consideration is whether the Court can substitute it view
in the place of the policy decision of the State exercised under Article 161 and
Sections 432, 433 of the Cr.P.C., just because, the judiciary differs from the view of
the Governor, who is head of the executive and act under the aid and advice of the
Council of Ministers.
23. This issue is well addressed in Epuru Sudhakar and another vs. Govt. of
A.P. reported in 2006 (8) SCC 161 by the Bench consisting of Hon'ble Mr.Justice
Arjit Pasayat and Hon'ble Mr.Justice S.H.Kapadia. Before considering the dictum
laid in the Epuru Sudhakar judgment [cited supra], it is also pertinent to record
that, in W.P.(MD)No.9177 of 2019 filed by Thiru P.Rathinam arising from this very
same case (S.C.No.10 of 2001), the writ petition filed to declare these 13 life
convicts are not eligible for premature release, this Court declined to entertain the
Writ and has observed that, ''When an administrative decision is taken by the
Government, this Court cannot intervene with the decision as such acting as an
W.P.(MD)Nos.24324 & 25333 of 2019 and 3431 of 2020
appellate authority.''
24. Reverting back to Epuru Sudhakar's case [cited supra], the Hon'ble
Supreme Court has observed that,
''65. Exercise of executive clemency is a matter of
discretion and yet subject to certain standards.       It is not a
matter of privilege. It is a matter of performance of official duty.
It is vested in the President or the Governor, as the case may be,
not for the benefit of the convict only, but for the welfare of the
people who may insist on the performance of the duty. This
discretion,    therefore,   has   to   be   exercised  on    public
considerations alone. The President and the Governor are the
sole judges of the sufficiency of facts and of the appropriateness
of granting the pardons and reprieves. However, this power is
an enumerated power in the Constitution and its limitations, if
any, must be found in the Constitution itself. Therefore, the
principle of exclusive cognizance would not apply when and if
the decision impugned is in derogation of a constitutional
provision. This is the basic working test to be applied while
granting pardons, reprieves, remissions and commutations.
66. Granting of pardon is in no sense an overturning of a
judgment of conviction, but rather it is an executive action that
mitigates or sets aside the punishment for a crime. It eliminates
the effect of conviction without addressing the defendant's guilt
or innocence. The controlling factor in determining whether the
exercise of prerogative power is subject to judicial review is not
its source but its subject-matter. It can no longer be said that
W.P.(MD)Nos.24324 & 25333 of 2019 and 3431 of 2020
prerogative power is ipso facto immune from judicial review. An
undue exercise of this power is to be deplored. Considerations
of religion, caste or political loyalty are irrelevant and fraught
with discrimination. These are prohibited grounds. The Rule of
Law is the basis for evaluation of all decisions. The supreme
quality of the Rule of Law is fairness and legal certainty. The
principle of legality occupies a central plan in the Rule of Law.
Every prerogative has to be subject to the Rule of Law. That rule
cannot be compromised on the grounds of political expediency.
To go by such considerations would be subversive of the
fundamental principles of the Rule of Law and it would amount
to setting a dangerous precedent. The Rule of Law principle
comprises a requirement of “Government according to law”.
The ethos of “Government according to law” requires the
prerogative to be exercised in a manner which is consistent with
the basic principle of fairness and certainty. Therefore, the
power of executive clemency is not only for the benefit of the
convict, but while exercising such a power the President or the
Governor, as the case may be, has to keep in mind the effect of
his decision on the family of the victims, the society as a whole
and the precedent it sets for the future.''
25. It is also beneficial to refer the observation of judgment of this Court
passed by the Division Bench in W.P.No.5073 of 2021, dated 25.03.2022 in Zaheera
Banu vs. State of Tamil Nadu arising from a writ petition challenging the refusal to
extend the benefit of G.O.(Ms)No.1155, Home (Pri.IV) Department, dated
11.09.2008 and G.O.(Ms)No.64, Home (Prison-IV) Department, dated 01.02.2018,
W.P.(MD)Nos.24324 & 25333 of 2019 and 3431 of 2020
by the State Government.
26. After relying upon observations of the Supreme Court made in earlier
cases, the learned Judge has vividly explained the process undertaken before the
administrative decision and the prerogative of the State under the scheme of
constitution in the following words:-
''22. Under our Constitutional Scheme, the judiciary is
vested with the power to decide the culpability or otherwise of
an accused objectively based on the evidence on record. After
the judiciary convicts and sentences an accused, the convicted
accused is handed over to the executive for implementing the
sentence imposed by the Court. The executive cannot sit in
judgment over the correctness of the findings of the judiciary.
Life imprisonment means imprisonment until the end of the
natural life of the convicted accused. The Governor has the
sovereign power under Article 161, ibid., to remit the sentence.
The Governor acts under the aid and advice of the Council of
Ministers (Cabinet). The Chief Minister and his Council of
Ministers should enjoy the confidence of the majority of the
elected members in the assembly. The task of governance of the
State is on the Chief Minister and his Council of Ministers.
Therefore, when they advise the Governor not to grant
premature release to a prisoner, the Court should be slow in
interfering with that order. In Epuru Sudhakar and Another Vs.
Government of Andhra Pradesh and Others [(2006) 8 SCC
161], the grounds on which judicial review of the order of the
W.P.(MD)Nos.24324 & 25333 of 2019 and 3431 of 2020
Governor passed under Article 161, ibid., can be done have
been enumerated. The Court cannot also issue a mandamus to
the Governor directing him to exercise his power under Article
27. In Epuru Sudhakar's case [cited supra], to recollect the words of Justice
S.H.Kapadia, the power of pardon is the prerogative of the Government, but not
immune from judicial review. If the decision indicates exercise of the power by
application of manageable standards, Courts will not interfere in its supervisory
jurisdiction. By manageable standard, we mean standard expected in functioning
democracy. A pardon obtained by fraud or granted by mistake or granted for
improper reasons would invite judicial review.
28. In the instant case, we find the impugned order of premature release been
issued after due consideration of facts relevant. It includes the objections from the
side of victims and the conduct of the prisoners during the parole and in prison. The
law and order situation prevailing in the Village after three out of 17 convicts
released prematurely earlier. The parity between those three convicts and the
remaining 13 convicts (one died due to illness).
29. The learned counsel for the petitioners referring the earlier conviction of
one Ramar in S.C.No.78 of 2007, on the file of the Principal District Judge, Karur,
W.P.(MD)Nos.24324 & 25333 of 2019 and 3431 of 2020
for the major offence under Section 302 IPC, submitted that S.C.No.78 of 2007 is a
case of double murder of Scheduled Caste community members. Pending trial of this
case, he has committed similar crime, in which 6 members of the SC community
were murdered. This is a relevant material, which has not been considered while
ordering premature release.
30. The learned Senior Counsel appearing for the State, in response, submitted
that in both the earlier case in S.C.No.78 of 2007 as well as in S.C.No.10 of 2001,
though charges were framed for the offences under the SC & ST (POA) Act, 1989, in
both the cases, the accused were acquitted of the charges under the SC & ST (POA)
Act by the trial Courts. The murder occurred not because the victims were members
of SC community, but for other reasons. Ramar preferred appeal before the High
Court in Crl.A.No.369 of 2008 against the conviction in S.C.No.78 of 2007. The
Hon'ble High Court in Crl.A.No.369 of 2008, ordered the period of sentence
imposed in S.C.No.78 of 2007 to run concurrently along with the sentence imposed
in S.C.No.10 of 2001. Thus, the life imprisonment imposed in these two cases got
merged. Therefore, it is incorrect to allege that the antecedent of the prison was not
considered.
31. The reading of the judgment of Ramar and others vs. State of Tamil
Nadu and others in Crl.A.No.369 of 2008, dated 07.07.2010 against the judgment
of conviction and sentence imposed in S.C.No.78 of 2007, the judgment of
W.P.(MD)Nos.24324 & 25333 of 2019 and 3431 of 2020
Alagarsamy and others vs. State of Tamil Nadu and others in Crl.A.No.803 of
2002 etc. along with the revision filed on behalf of the victim against order of
acquittal passed in S.C.No.10 of 2008 and the order of the Supreme Court on further
appeal by Alagarsamy and others, we find though few of the accused are common in
both the cases, the reason and motive for the occurrence are not same and the trial
Court in both the cases, has disbelieved the case of the prosecution that the murder
was committed because the victims belong to SC community. Therefore, there is no
reason to infer that the State has failed to consider relevant materials or passed the
order of premature release for extraneous considerations.
32. It is further reported by the learned Additional Public Prosecutor through
the status report that there is no law and order problem either when the prisoners
were released on parole on various occasions and also after their premature release.
This justifies the discretion of the State exercising its prerogative power applying
mind considering all relevant materials. In fine, on appreciating the facts and the
perusal of records, this Court finds no irrelevant or extraneous materials entered into
the decision making process. Therefore, the order granting premature release
sustains.
33. In the result, the Writ Petitions are dismissed. No costs. Consequently,
C.M.P.(MD)No.2884 of 2020 is closed.
