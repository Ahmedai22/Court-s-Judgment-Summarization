No.21 of 2004 against the concerned accused persons
for    the     alleged      offence    punishable       under       Sections
426, 427, 341 and 114 of the Indian Penal Code. It is
submitted         that    initially      the     concerned      Magistrate
Court passed an order under Section 210 of the Code
of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (hereinafter referred to
as ‘the Code’) and report of the concerned police
officer was called for. After perusing the report of
the concerned officer, the concerned Magistrate Court
followed the procedure under Section 202 of the Code.
The deposition of the present applicant was recorded
at   Exh.14.          After  perusing       the   material      placed          on
record, the concerned Magistrate Court dismissed the
complaint under Section 203 of the Code vide order
dated     16.07.2016.        It  is    submitted       that     thereafter
petitioner filed Criminal Revision Application No.28
of 2016 before the Sessions Court and Sessions Court,
vide impugned order dated 24.08.2021, dismissed the
said revision application and therefore the petition
has preferred this petition under Article 227 of the
Constitution of India.
5.     Learned advocate for the petitioner has assailed
the impugned order mainly on the ground that the
concerned          Magistrate    Court        has   not   followed            the
procedure prescribed under the Code before dismissing
the complaint under Section 203 of the Code. It is
further submitted that the Sessions Court has also
not     properly         appreciated         the   relevant         aspects.
Learned         advocate,      thereafter,          referred         to       the
averments and allegations made against the concerned
accused person in the complaint filed by the present
petitioner. After referring to the said allegations,
it is submitted that, prima facie, the ingredients of
the alleged offence are made out and therefore the
concerned trial Court has committed an error while
dismissing the complaint on the ground that dispute
between       the      parties   is    of     civil   nature.        Learned
advocate,         therefore,    urged       that   both   the      impugned
orders passed by the Courts below be quashed and set
6.     On the other hand, learned APP has opposed this
petition and referred the impugned order passed by
the    concerned         Magistrate     Court,     copy   of     which         is
placed on record at page 24-A of the compilation.
Learned APP has thereafter referred the deposition of
the petitioner, which was recorded by the concerned
Magistrate           Court   while     conducting       inquiry          under
Section 202 of the Code. Learned APP, thereafter,
referred         the    observations        made   by   the      concerned
Sessions           Court     while      rejecting       the        revision
application.            Learned     APP       after    referring             the
aforesaid          documents,    contended        that   no      error         is
committed          by   the   concerned        Sessions    Court         while
rejecting the revision application and therefore this
petition may not be entertained.
7.       Having heard the learned advocates appearing
for the parties and having gone through the material
placed on record, it would emerge that the petitioner
filed private compliant under Sections 426, 427, 341
and 114 of IPC before the concerned Magistrate Court.
Thereafter, the concerned Magistrate passed an order
under Section 210 of the Code and asked the concerned
police authority to submit a report. After perusing
the report, the concerned Magistrate thought it fit
to follow the procedure prescribed under Section 202
of the Code. During the course of inquiry conducted
under Section 202 of the Code, the deposition of the
present        petitioner      –     original      complainant             was
recorded vide Exh.14, copy of which is placed on
record at page 21A of the compilation. The concerned
Magistrate, thereafter, on the basis of the material
available on the record with him, specifically gave
the finding that the dispute between the complainant
– present petitioner and the original accused is of
civil     nature       and   therefore        on  that     ground          the
complaint         filed    by   the       petitioner    came         to      be
dismissed under Section 203 of the Code. Petitioner,
thereafter,          preferred    revision       application           under
Section 397 of the Code before the concerned Sessions
Court.       The      said   revision        application        is       also
dismissed. From the record, it appears that a Regular
Civil Suit No.107 of 2004 is pending between the
parties for the same issue before the concerned Civil
Court at Mahuva. The said aspect is reflected from
the impugned order passed by the concerned Sessions
Court.      The      concerned     opponent       of   the       Revision
Application produced a copy of the said civil suit
vide Mark 18/1 before the concerned Sessions Court
and after verifying the record, the Sessions Court
has specifically observed that the civil suit is also
pending between the parties for the same reason and
therefore revision application filed by the present
petitioner was not entertained.
8.      This Court has considered the reasoning recorded
by the Sessions Court and this Court is of the view
that no error is committed by the Sessions Court
while rejecting the revision application filed by the
petitioner. Hence, no interference is required in the
present petition, which is filed under Article 227 of
the Constitution of India. Accordingly, petition is
