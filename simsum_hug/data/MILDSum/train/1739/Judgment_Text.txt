BSA/B/06/07/314-37 dated 31.08.2007, the reference was made by the
Superintendent of Police (Border), Baksa district on the basis of investigation
and enquiry that the petitioner along with other family members are foreigners
coming into Assam after 01.01.1966 and before 25.03.1971. It is on the basis of
this reference, the Tribunal registered a case and proceeded to answer the
reference made. The extract of the reference is reproduced herein below:
Order reference M/S 2 (i) (A) under foreigners (Tribunal) order 1963 against
suspected foreigners MusstGolapi Begum, W/O MdFazalAliVillN.K. Darranga P.S. Tamulpur in
I have gone through the Enquiry report of suspected Foreigners MussttGolapi
Begum, W/O MdFazalAliVillNKDarranga suspected by SI (B) Akan Ch. Medhi during enquiry the
suspect MussttGolapi Begum appears to be a foreigners, who entered into Assam after 1 st
January 1966 and before 25th March 1971.
Under the circumstances I Sri P.K. Dutta A.P.S. Superintendent of Police (B) Baksa
hereby forward the case to foreigners Tribunal, Nalbari for favour of opinion whether the
suspect MussttGolapi Begumalongwith his family members mentioned in col No 13 are the
foreigners coming into Assam, after 1st January 1966 and before 25th March, 1971. The
interrogation from alongwith the statement of witnesses etc are sent herewith for favour of
perusal.
10. From the reference, it is clear that the investigations conducted by the
police have revealed that the petitioner and her family members are foreigners
who came into Assam after 01.01.1966 and before 25.03.1971 and the same
was referred to the Tribunal for its opinion.
11. The Tribunal entered into the reference on the grounds and reasons
mentioned therein. It arrived at the conclusion recorded in Paragraph-18 of the
opinion that the petitioner had entered into India illegally after 24.03.1971 from
the specified territory and the reference was disposed of by holding that the
proceedee(petitioner) is a foreigner.
12. In terms of Order 2(1), the Tribunal gets its jurisdiction to render its
opinion only when any reference is made to it under Order of the Foreigners
(Tribunals for Assam) Order, 2006. Without a reference being made, Tribunal
cannot exercise its jurisdiction to opine that a person is or is not a foreigner. It is
only when a reference is made as above that the Tribunal assumes jurisdiction
to render its opinion. It has further been held by this Court that the Tribunal will
have to confine its opinion to the terms of the reference made to it and not go
beyond the same. Admittedly, in this case, reference was that petitioner was a
foreigner who had illegally entered into India (Assam) from the specified
territory during the period 01.01.1966 to 24.03.1971. The Tribunal was required
to answer the reference either in favour of the State or in favour of the
proceedee. If the reference was to be answered in favour of the State and it
was answered rightly so by the Tribunal, the natural corollary would be that
petitioner is a foreigner belonging to the 01.01.1966 to 24.03.1971 stream.
Therefore, the view taken by the Tribunal that the Foreigners’ Act, 1946 or the
Orders framed thereunder do not bind it to the terms of the reference is not
correct. The Tribunal cannot suo motu assume jurisdiction to give an opinion
which is not sought. No opinion was sought from the Tribunal as to whether the
petitioner entered India after 24.03.1971 or not.
13. As such, though the reference made by the Superintendent of Police
(Border), Baksa vide Memo No. BSA/B/06/07/314-37 dated 31.08.2007 against
the petitioner was that he was a foreigner who entered into Assam after
01.01.1966 and before 25.03.1971, the Tribunal, however, rendered its opinion
by holding that the petitioner entered India on or after 25.03.1971. The issue of
theForeigners’ Tribunal assuming jurisdiction beyond the reference has been
held to be not permissible by this Court in Santosh Das Vs. Union of India
reported in (2017) 2 GLT 1065 and in WP(C) No.1293/2021 [SonaKha @
Sona Khan vs. Union of India and Ors.] disposed of on 24.03.2021.
14. We have perused the judgments rendered by this Court and we are of the
opinion that ratio laid down by the aforesaid judgments will be applicable in the
present case. As discussed above, it is seen that though the reference was
made by the Superintendent of Police (Border), Baksa for an opinion of the
Foreigners’ Tribunal, that the petitioner is an illegal immigrant who entered India
between 01.01.1966 and 25.03.1971, the Tribunal went beyond the reference
and rendered its opinion that the petitioner and her family members are illegal
immigrants who entered India after 25.03.1971, which is clearly impermissible
in law.
15.     Accordingly,   we    are    of  the    view      that the   opinion    dated
29.11.2019impugned in the present proceedings rendered by Foreigners
Tribunal, Baksa, Tamulpur in F.T. Case No. 126/Baksa/2017 holding that the
petitioner is a foreigner after 25.03.1971 is beyond the reference made by the
Superintendent of Police (Border), Baksa vide Memo No. BSA/B/06/07/314-37
dated 31.08.2007 and thus, illegal.
16. We, therefore, interfere with and set aside the impugned opinion dated
29.11.2019 passed in F.T. Case No.126/Baksa/2017 and remand the matter to
the Foreigners Tribunal, Baksa, Tamulpur for a fresh decision in terms of the
reference of Superintendent of Police (Border), Baksa district in F.T. Case
No.51/07 issued vide Memo No. BSA/B/06/07/314-37 dated 31.08.2007 made.
The Foreigners’ Tribunal will hear the matter afresh and thereafter, render a
finding as to whether the petitioner entered India between 01.01.1966 and
25.03.1971 or not.
17. It is needless to say that in the event, the Foreigners’ Tribunal answers the
reference in affirmative, the petitioner will be entitled to the benefits of
registration under Sub-section 3 of Section 6A of the Citizenship Act, 1995 read
with Rule 19 of the Citizenship Rules, 2009.
18. The writ petition is accordingly disposed of in terms of the above.
19. LCR be immediately remitted to the Foreigners Tribunal, Baksa, Tamulpur.
