1.      Issue notice. Ms. Seema Dolo and Mr. Mohinder Rupal, learned
counsels, accept notice on behalf of University of Delhi in W.P.(C)
5664/2021 and 5668/2021 respectively. Mr. Preetpal Singh, learned
counsel, accepts notice on behalf of Bar Council of India [“BCI”] in
W.P.(C) 5664/2021. Ms. Nidhi Mittal, learned counsel, accepts notice on
behalf of University Grants Commission [“UGC”] in W.P.(C) 5664/2021.
2.      The petitioners are students in the final year of the LL.B. course in
the Faculty of Law, Delhi University [“the University”]. They have filed
this petition under Article 226 of the Constitution in respect of an open
book examination proposed to be held by the University in respect of
their fourth semester papers, which were postponed from May, 2020 in
view of the Covid-19 pandemic. Although the petitioners are similarly
placed, inasmuch as they are all sixth semester students in the LL.B.
programme, the grievances which have been articulated by their learned
counsel, noted below, are slightly different.
3.      The common case of the petitioners is broadly that the UGC, by a
notification dated 29.04.2020, permitted the evaluation               of the
intermediate semester students i.e. students who were not in the final
year, by a combination of marks obtained in the internal evaluation and
past performance. The University adopted this course for most of its
W.P.(C)5664/2021 and connected matter                                Page 2 of 7
courses. However, the BCI, by a series of notifications, commencing
from 09.06.2020 and terminating with a notification dated 01.11.2020,
directed all law colleges to hold examinations for the intermediate
semesters also. Learned counsel for the petitioners point out that the
notification of the BCI dated 01.11.2020, insofar as it relates to
intermediate semester examinations, was set aside by the Karnataka High
Court by a judgment dated 08.02.2021 in W.P.(C) 14839/2020 [Ritvik
Balanagraj B. vs. Bar Council of India & Ors.] and connected matters.
4.      In these circumstances, Mr. Siddharth Seem, learned counsel for
the petitioners in W.P.(C) 5664/2021, urges that instead of an open book
examination, the University ought to be directed to evaluate the students
for their fourth semester, only on the basis of internal evaluation and past
performance. Although he candidly admits that the UGC notification
dated 29.04.2020 does not contain any prohibition on holding of
examinations in respect of intermediate semesters, he submits that the
approach of the University is inconsistent with the interests of students in
the wake of Covid-19 pandemic. Mr. Seem particularly emphasises that
several students have suffered illness, loss in their families, financial
hardships in the family, and have been burdened with responsibilities far
beyond those which fall upon them in normal times. He, therefore,
submits that an evaluation, at least as far as the fourth semester is
concerned, on the basis of internal assessments and past performance
would suffice, and would also aid in expeditious completion of the
evaluation process. Mr. Seem has drawn my attention to paragraphs 22 to
26 of the aforesaid judgment of the Karnataka High Court in this regard.
His final submission is that by a notification of the University dated
W.P.(C)5664/2021 and connected matter                               Page 3 of 7
04.06.2020, students in intermediate semesters in all other programmes
were promoted on the basis of internal evaluation and previous
performance, and were not subjected to any examination. It is the
contention of learned counsel that the differentiation was subsequently
adopted only in respect of students of the Law Faculty, presumably on
account of the BCI notifications.
5.      Mr. Prateek Sharma, learned counsel for the petitioners in
W.P.(C)5668/2021, points out during the course of hearing that, by a
notice issued yesterday (31.05.2021), the University has announced that,
as far as the petitioners’ batch of students is concerned, the examinations
for the sixth semester will commence from 14.06.2021 and the pending
examinations of the fourth semester (which the petitioners would
ordinarily have taken in the academic session 2019-20), will be
tentatively scheduled around 15.07.2021. A copy of the notice has been
shared on screen by Mr. Sharma, from which it appears that the
University is proceeding on the basis of the notifications issued by the
BCI, including the notification dated 01.11.2020, in setting the schedule
for these examinations. The notice, in fact, specifically refers to the
aforesaid notification of the BCI.
6.      Mr. Sharma supports the case laid out by Mr. Seem but also
contends that the examination for the sixth semester ought to be held only
after the fourth semester results are made available. He submits that the
procedure of holding the sixth semester examinations first would be
detrimental to the students in the position of the petitioners as, in the
event a student requires or desires to repeat any of the fourth semester
papers, that opportunity will be available to him/her only after one year,
W.P.(C)5664/2021 and connected matter                              Page 4 of 7
when the fourth semester examinations are next held in the regular
course. Per contra, the supplementary examinations for the sixth semester
are, according to Mr. Sharma, held soon after the conclusion of the
regular sixth semester examination, to enable the students to repeat the
examinations and conclude their course expeditiously.
7.      Mr. Preetpal Singh, learned counsel for the BCI, brings it to the
notice of the Court that the BCI has set up a committee headed by a
former Chief Justice of the Allahabad High Court and comprising the
heads of law faculties in various universities, to deliberate upon the
nature of the evaluation. The committee is expected to submit its report
within the next one week, following which it will be considered by the
counsels.
8.      Mr. Rupal and Ms. Dolo, learned counsels for the University, have
drawn my attention to the notification dated 31.05.2021 to submit that the
fourth semester examinations, with which the present petitioners are
concerned, are scheduled to be held only around 15.07.2021. They submit
that the University will, in the meantime, further consider the necessity of
holding the aforesaid examinations, particularly in the light of the
submissions recorded above regarding the alternative modes of
assessment available to the University under the UGC notification dated
29.04.2020, and the aforesaid judgment of the Karnataka High Court
whereby the BCI notification dated 01.11.2020 was quashed, insofar as it
related to intermediate semester examinations. The University is at liberty
to consider the matter, as submitted by learned counsel on its behalf. The
decision taken by the University be placed on record in its counter-
affidavit.
W.P.(C)5664/2021 and connected matter                              Page 5 of 7
9.      The University will also elaborate in its affidavit, as to the
arrangements which it is making to ensure that the Covid-19 affected
students, students who are unable to clear the examinations and those
who seek to improve their marks, are given a second opportunity to take
the aforesaid fourth semester examinations within a reasonable time
frame. The University will also place on record the arrangements made
for evaluation of intermediate semester candidates in other courses.
10.     As mentioned above, these petitions concern only the intermediate
(fourth) semester examinations, which remain pending for the petitioners
and their batch of students. As the said examinations are not going to be
held prior to the next date of hearing, there is no occasion to pass any
interim order relating thereto at this stage.
11.     Mr. Sharma however points out that, in W.P.(C) 5668/2021, the
interim relief sought is for stay of a notification dated 28.05.2021,
whereby the University had scheduled the petitioners’ sixth semester
examinations prior to their fourth semester examinations. Although it is
unclear whether the notification dated 28.05.2021 survives the issuance
of the further notification dated 31.05.2021, Mr. Sharma presses for an
interim order to the effect that the sixth semester examinations must be
held only after the fourth semester examinations.
12.     As noticed above, this contention is founded not upon the timing of
the examinations themselves, but upon the timing of the supplementary
examinations, which would be available to the petitioners, if required.
However, the aforesaid contention does not require a stay to be granted
against the sixth semester examinations, proposed to be held in June,
2021. The arrangements which would enable the petitioners to clear any
W.P.(C)5664/2021 and connected matter                              Page 6 of 7
remaining papers of their fourth semester examination, within a
reasonable time frame, can be examined independently in the course of
this petition. It is not in the interests of the students as a whole to
postpone the sixth semester examinations – and consequently extend the
duration of their academic programme - only on the basis of the
apprehension that a repeat examination of the fourth semester may not be
available until next year. If the petitioners make out a case for such an
order, the rights of the parties in this regard can be adjusted at the
appropriate stage, by            directing that the University   holds the
supplementary examination for the fourth semester within a reasonable
time. Mr. Sharma’s request for an interim order is, therefore, declined.
13.     The respondents are directed to file their counter affidavits within
three weeks, positively. Rejoinders thereto, if any, may be filed within
one week thereafter.
14.     List on 05.07.2021.
