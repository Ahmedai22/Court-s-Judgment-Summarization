6.      Mr. Rahul Mehra, who is appearing in person, has objected to this
application stating that the Applicant ought not to have come to this Court
with the present application at the last minute. He further states that granting
any latitude to the Applicant would result in further applications being filed
before this Court by other Sport Federations which are in complete violation
of the Sports Code. He states that the present petition is not adversarial in
nature and has been filed only keeping in mind the interests of sports in the
country. He states that the NRAI is also in violation of various Clauses of
the Sports Code.
7.      Mr. Mehra has given an ad hoc solution stating that a committee
comprising of a retired Judge of this Court and Mr. Abhinav Bindra, the first
Olympic Gold Medal winner in Shooting, must be constituted to oversee the
World Cup event in March, 2023. He states that the funds which are
proposed to be released must be passed through the Committee and the
Committee must furnish its Report in a sealed cover before this Court upon
the conclusion of the World Cup event.
8.      The suggestion made by Mr. Mehra for constitution of a Committee to
oversee the utilisation of funds which are proposed to be released by the
Union of India is a fair solution. This proposal of Mr. Mehra is not opposed
by the learned ASG and by the learned Senior Counsel appearing for NRAI.
9.      The prestige of the country will be affected if there is any impediment
in organizing the World Cup event which would require funding from the
Union of India.
