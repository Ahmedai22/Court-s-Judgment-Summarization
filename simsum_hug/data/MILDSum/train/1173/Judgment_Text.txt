      Learned Counsel for the CBI has filed the progress
report disclosing the stage of investigation. Report has
been filed in pursuance to the order of this Court dated
25th of March, 2022 whereby this Court had handed over
the investigation of the incident of putting on fire 10
houses of the village Bogtui at Birbhum’s Rampurhat at
the late night on 21st of March, 2022 resulting into death
of at least 8 persons.
      The report has been produced in the sealed cover
which has been opened, perused and taken on record.
      Supplementary affidavit in WPA(P) 129 of 2022 as
also CAN 1 of 2022 in       WPA(P) 125 of 2022, CAN 1 of
                                   WPA (P) 130 of 2022 and 5 others
2022 in WPA(P) 126 of 2022 and CAN 1 of 2022 in WPA(P)
133 of 2022 have been filed with the prayer to clarify the
earlier order of this Court and hand over the investigation
in the case of murder of Bhadu Sk to the CBI since the
incident of burning of the houses at Bogtui took place as
a counter-blast to murder of Bhadu Sk.
      It has been submitted by the      learned Counsel for
the applicants in the CAN and the supplementary
affidavit that in order to have complete investigation and
to unearth truth behind the incident of burning of 8
persons alive, the investigation in the case of Bhadu Sk
murder should also be done by the CBI as both the
incidents are interconnected and the investigating agency
in Bhadu Sk murder case is trying to cover up the issue
which will affect the investigation by CBI.
      Learned Counsel for the CBI has submitted that CBI
has no objection in conducting the investigation in Bhadu
Sk murder case but this prayer should have been made
earlier. He has submitted that it is better if the
investigation is done in both the cases by the same
agency as both are interlinked and that will also facilitate
trial of the cases before the same Judge.
      Learned Advocate General has submitted that except
in WPA(P) 126 of 2022 there is no prayer in other
petitions for conducting the investigation in the case of
murder of Bhadu Sk by the CBI and that there is no
allegation that the investigation in the case of murder of
                                   WPA (P) 130 of 2022 and 5 others
Bhadu Sk is not being done properly. He has disclosed
that Rampurhat PS Case No. 168 of 22 has been
registered in respect of incident of Bhadu Sk murder.
     We have heard the learned Counsel for the parties
and perused the record.
     The Report submitted by the CBI before this Court
today prima facie suggests that brutal incident of burning
and killing at Bogtui village is the direct fall out of killing
of Bhadu Sk son of Marfat Sk of village Bogtui at 8.30
P.M. on the same day. It also suggests that the incident is
outcome of the rivalry amongst the members of two
groups in the village and that burning of the houses
resulting into death of 8 persons was retaliatory plan.
     In the applications filed before this Court as also in
the supplementary affidavit filed in WPA(P) 129 of 2022 it
has been alleged that the unfortunate incident of setting
10 houses on fire is not an isolation and independent
incident rather it is a counter-blast of murder of Bhadu
Sk who was the Upa-Pradhan allegedly belonging to the
ruling party in the State.
     Both the incidents took place within a gap of about 2
hours. Material placed on record prima facie suggests
close relationship and linkage between the two incidents.
The incidents are alleged to be result of political rivalry.
The allegation of the applicants that both incidents form
part of the common conspiracy and continuous cause of
action cannot be ignored.
                                     WPA (P) 130 of 2022 and 5 others
      It is also worth noting if one agency investigates both
the incidents then not only it will be easier to unearth the
truth but it will also facilitate trial before the same
      The object of issuing the necessary direction in the
suo motu petition is to ensure appropriate action against
the person responsible for the incident. On the basis of
the material which is available before us, we are of the
opinion that the said object can be more appropriately
achieved if the incident of murder of Bhadu Sk is also
investigated by the CBI along with the incident of burning
of houses and murder of villagers of Bogtui which took
place shortly thereafter. The second incident prima facie
seems to be the fall out of first incident.
      Hence, we allow the prayer made in CAN 1 of 2022 in
WPA(P) 125 of 2022, CAN 1 of 2022 in WPA(P) 126 of
2022 and CAN 1 of 2022 in WPA(P) 133 of 2022 and
direct the investigating agency to immediately hand over
the investigation in the case of murder of Bhadu Sk being
Rampurhat PS Case No. 168 of 22 to the CBI along with
all the record of investigation which is conducted till now
as also the accused which have been arrested.
      The CBI is directed to investigate the murder case of
Bhadu Sk along with the investigation in the case of
Bogtui house burning and murder case.
      CBI is directed to file further report of investigation
in both the cases on the next date of hearing.
                             WPA (P) 130 of 2022 and 5 others
List on 02nd of May, 2022.
