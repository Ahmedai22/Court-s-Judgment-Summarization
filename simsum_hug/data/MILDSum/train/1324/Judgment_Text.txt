Counsel for Respondent :- A.S.G.,Vijay Vikram Singh
1.      These proceedings under Article 226 of the Constitution of
India have ostensibly been instituted in public interest challenging
paragraphs 3 of an order issued on 19th September, 1989 by the
Election Commission of India (hereinafter referred to as "Election
Commission"), whereby it has been observed that Bhartiya Janta
Party shall be recognized as a National Party, for which symbol
"Lotus" shall be reserved for it in terms of the provisions
contained in sub paragraph 2 of paragraph 7 of the Election
Symbols (Reservation and Allotment) (Second Amendment) Order
1989 (hereinafter referred to as "Second Amendment Order,
2.      Similar prayer has been made challenging paragraph 3 of
another order dated 23rd September, 1989 issued by the Election
Commission, whereby it has been observed that Indian National
Congress shall be a National Party for which symbol "Hand" shall
be reserved.
3.      Heard Shri Sheshmani Nath Tripathi, petitioner in person
and Shri Vijay Vikram Singh, learned counsel representing the
4.      At the outset, we may observe that though this petition has
purportedly been filed in "public interest", however, from the
pleadings available on record, it can very well be inferred that the
petitioner has attempted to espouse a personal cause as well. In
this regard, it is noted that in paragraph 6 of the petition it has
been stated that the petitioner is a primary member of Samajwadi
Party in U.P. which is a registered political party under section
29A of the Representation of People Act, 1951 (hereinafter
referred to as the "Act") and plea of discrimination in issuance of
Letters of Registration under section 29A of the Act has been
raised by stating that paragraph 3 in the impugned orders dated
19th September, 1989 and 23rd September, 1989 issued by the
Election Commission in respect of two political parties, namely,
Bhartiya Janta Party and Indian National Congress, it has been
provided that these parties shall be National Parties and their
election symbols shall also be reserved, however, similar
provision is missing in the registration letter issued in respect of
Samajwadi Party on 21st May, 1993. Thus a cause on behalf of the
Samajwadi Party has also been attempted to be pleaded in this writ
petition. In the same breath, however, the petitioner also states in
the writ petition that he does not have any personal or private
interest in this writ petition in any manner whatsoever and that the
P.I.L Civil No.28404 of 2021                            page 2 of18
petition has been filed in public interest and also that the entire
cost of litigation is being borne by the petitioner himself. The
petitioner has also stated that he is a public spirited person and that
the matter raised herein carries immense importance as such he
has filed this petition. In paragraph 4 of the writ petition, it has
also been averred by the petitioner that the result of this litigation
will not lead to any undue gain to himself or to any one associated
with him or any undue loss to any one, body of persons or the
State, though the petitioner, admittedly, is a member of another
political party, namely, Samajwadi Party.
5.       The writ petition also, in our considered opinion, suffers
from non-joinder of necessary parties. In this regard, it is
noticeable that though it has been prayed in the writ petition that
paragraph 3 of the letters of recognition dated 19th September,
1989 and 23rd September, 1989 may be quashed and struck down,
however, the political parties, which are likely to be affected in
case the prayer made in this petition is granted, have not been
impleaded as respondents.
6.      As noticed above, letters of registration issued by the
Election Commission way back in the year 1989 are now being
challenged after a lapse of about 32 years offering an explanation
that in case of violation of fundamental rights conferred on the
citizenary of this country in part III of the Constitution of India,
delay is not material. Further explanation which has been sought
to be given is that the impugned letters of registration have been
challenged as the petitioner received reply to a query made by him
under the Right to Information Act from the Election Commission
by its letter dated 12.05.2021 enclosing therewith the impugned
letters of registration in response to his application dated
15.04.2021. The said reply, it has been stated, was received by the
P.I.L Civil No.28404 of 2021                              page 3 of18
petitioner on 27.10.2021. The explanation offered for such
inordinate delay in instituting this petition though is not
satisfactory, however, we are entertaining the petition for the
reasons given hereinafter.
7.      Having      observed    as above,  we     have,  nonetheless,
entertained this writ petition and proceed to decide the same as an
important issue has been raised in the petition pertaining to scope
and ambit of section 29A of the Act and also the powers and
jurisdiction of Election Commission under Article 324 of the
Constitution of India.
8.      It has been argued by the petitioner that the letters of
registration dated 19th September, 1989 and 23rd September, 1989
have been issued by the Election Commission in exercise of its
power vested in it under section 29A of the Act which clearly does
not empower the Election Commission either to declare a political
party as a National Party or to reserve its election symbol,
therefore paragraph 3 of the said letters of registration are bad in
9.      Drawing attention of the Court to the language used in
section 29A of the Act, it has vehemently been submitted by the
petitioner that the said provision empowers the Election
Commission only to decide either to register an association or a
body as a political party or not so to register it on consideration of
the particulars and other relevant factors as required by the said
section. It has, thus, been urged that as per the scheme envisaged
in section 29A of the Act, an association or a body of individuals
is required to make an application for its registration as a political
party giving particulars/information required under sub sections 2,
3, 4 and 5 of section 29-A of the Act and the Election Commission
after receiving the particulars/information, is mandated to consider
P.I.L Civil No.28404 of 2021                             page 4 of18
the same and take a decision either to register the applicant as a
political party or not to register it. The petitioner has thus,
submitted that section 29-A of the Act does not in its ambit
encompass the powers of recognizing a political party as a
National Party or a State Party or to reserve the Election Symbol
for such a political party.
10.     On the strength of the aforesaid submission, it has thus, been
argued that the impugned paragraph 3 of the letters of registration
dated 19th September, 1989 and 23rd September, 1989 whereby
the political parties concerned have been recognized as National
Parties and election symbols have also been reserved, is unlawful,
without jurisdiction and amounts to transgression of its authority
and power by the Election Commission as vested in it under
section 29A of the Act. It has further been argued that the
impugned stipulation contained in paragraph 3 of the letters of
registration dated 19th September, 1989 and 23rd September, 1989
is not available in the letters of registration issued by the Election
Commission in respect of other political parties, such as
Samajwadi Party and Vikas Party. The letters of registration of
these parties issued by the Election Commission have been
annexed as annexures 2, 3, 7 and 8 to the writ petition which are
dated 21.05.1993, 02.04.2014, 30.09.1989 and 06.11.1996
respectively. It has, thus, been argued that the impugned
stipulation in paragraph 3 in the letters of registration of two
parties is missing in the letters of registration issued under section
29A of the Act in respect of other political parties, which is
violative of Article 14 of the Constitution of India. The petitioner
has also pleaded that stipulation of impugned paragraphs in the
letters of registration in respect of aforementioned two political
parties is violative of Articles 19(1)(C) , 19(4) and 21 of the
P.I.L Civil No.28404 of 2021                              page 5 of18
Constitution of India. It has also been stated by the petitioner that
the impugned paragraphs of the letters of registration are non-est
in view of the provisions contained in Article 13 of the
Constitution of India.
11. Shri Tripathi has also submitted that it is not only that under
section 29A of the Act the Election Commission is not allowed to
allot symbols and grant recognition but also that there is no other
authority available to the Election Commission to grant
recognition or grant symbol to any political party. Reference in
this regard has been made by the petitioner to the Election
Symbols (Reservation and Allotment) Order, 1968 (hereinafter
referred to as "Allotment Order, 1968") who has stated that if a
field is already covered by the statutory provisions (in this case
section 29A of the Act), the Election Commission has to act within
its bounds as circumscribed by the said statute and even Article
324 of the Constitution of India does not permit the Election
Commission to travel beyond the scope of section 29A of the Act.
12.     On the other hand, Shri Vijay Vikram Singh, learned counsel
representing the Election Commission, has stated that the instant
petition does not espouse the cause of any public interest and that
the petition has been filed as Public Interest Litigation only as a
camouflage for serving personal interest. He has also argued that
delay of about 32 years in filing this petition has not been
explained. On the merit, learned counsel representing the Election
Commission has submitted that the impugned paragraph 3
contained in the letters of registration dated 19th September, 1989
and 23rd September, 1989 does not suffer from any illegality and
as a matter of fact, the same are only a communication of the fact
that these political parties were National Parties and that their
symbols were reserved. He has, thus, argued that even though
P.I.L Civil No.28404 of 2021                            page 6 of18
paragraphs 3 of these two letters of registration are not referable to
section 29A of the Act, however, the same being only a
communication of an existing fact, cannot be faulted with on any
count. On behalf of Election Commission, it has also been argued
that Article 324 of the Constitution of India vests plenary powers
in the Election Commission so far as superintendence, direction
and control of the elections are concerned. His submission, thus, is
that recognition of a political party as a National Party or a State
Party and reservation of symbols are the matters related to control
of elections as such the Election Commission is fully empowered
to issue Allotment Order, 1968 and that the impugned paragraphs
3 of the letters of registration are referable to the said Order, 1968.
13.     The Parliament has enacted Representation of People Act,
1951 to provide for conduct of elections to the Houses of
Parliament and to the House or the Houses of Legislature of each
State and the matters connected thereto. Part IV A was inserted in
the Representation of People Act by way of enacting Act 1 of 1989
by the Parliament, whereby section 29A was added. Section 29A
of the Act which came into force w.e.f.15.06.1989, is extracted
"29A. Registration with the Election Commission of
associations and bodies as political parties.—(1) Any
association or body of individual citizens of India calling
itself a political party and intending to avail itself of the
provisions of this Part shall make an application to the
Election Commission for its registration as a political

(a) if the association or body is in existence at the
commencement of the Representation of the People
(Amendment) Act, 1988 (1 of 1989), within sixty

Constitution of India as by law established, and to the
principles of socialism, secularism and democracy, and

(6) The Commission may call for such other particulars as
it may deem fit from the association or body.
(7) After considering all the particulars as aforesaid in its

P.I.L Civil No.28404 of 2021                                 page 8 of18
and after giving the representatives of the association or
body reasonable opportunity of being heard, the
Commission shall decide either to register the association
or body as a political party for the purposes of this Part, or
not so to register it; and the Commission shall
communicate its decision to the association or body:

or body conform to the provisions of sub-section (5).
(8) The decision of the Commission shall be final.
(9) After an association or body has been registered as a
political party as aforesaid, any change in its name, head
office, office-bearers, address or in any other material
matters shall be communicated to the Commission without
delay.]
Registration of political party-Scope and effect
Registration of political party is not compulsory, but
optional. However, registration enables a political party to
claim certain benefits under law such as accepting of a
contribution from any person or company. Similarly, under
Election Symbols Order, certain symbols are reserved fo a
recognized political party for the exclusive allotment to the
candidate seet up by such political party; Jeevan
Chandrabhan Idnani v. Divisional Commissioner, Konkan
14.    A perusal of the aforequoted section 29A of the Act reveals
that the said provision was added for the purposes of registration
of political parties. It provides that an association or body of
individual citizens of India which intends to avail itself of the
provisions of part IVA of the Act shall make an application to the
Election Commission for its registration as a political party. Sub
section 2 of section 29A provides for time period within which
such association or body may make an application seeking
P.I.L Civil No.28404 of 2021                             page 9 of18
registration as a political party. Sub sections 3, 4 and 5 stipulate
the information and other material to be furnished for registration.
Sub section 6 permits the Election Commission to call for such
other particulars as may be deemed fit from the association or the
body seeking its registration as a political party. Sub section 7
provides that the Commission on consideration of the application
and after giving reasonable opportunity of being heard to the
representative of the applicant shall decide either to register the
applicant as a political party or not so to register it for the
purposes of Part IVA of the Act. Section 29B and Section 29C
were inserted later in the Principal Act w.e.f. 11.09.2003 and
01.04.2017 respectively, which entitle a registered political party
to accept contributions and require such political party to declare
the donation received by it. Accordingly, registration of an
association or a body of citizens of India as a political party
enables it to claim certain benefits under law, such as accepting
contributions. It also obligates the political party to declare
donations received by it. Registration of a political party under
section 29A, as is apparent from a bare reading of the said
provision, is for the purposes of availing such political party of the
provisions of Part IVA of the Act.
15.     No doubt section 29A or any other provision contained in
Part IVA of the Act, 1951 does not empower the Election
Commission either to recognize a political party or to reserve the
election symbols. However, the power to recognize a National
Party or a State Party and to reserve the election symbol is in
terms of the provisions contained in the Allotment Order, 1968
which has been issued by the Election Commission in exercise of
its power conferred by Article 324 of the Constitution of India and
Rules 5 and 10 of the Conduct of Elections Rule, 1961 and all
other powers enabling it in that behalf. Clause 4 of the Allotment
P.I.L Civil No.28404 of 2021                             page 10 of18
Order, 1968 provides that a symbol shall be allotted to a
contesting party in accordance with the provisions of the said
order in every contested election. Clause 5 classifies the election
symbols into two categories, namely, (i) reserved symbol which is
a symbol reserved for a recognized political party for exclusive
allotment to the contesting candidates set up by that party and (ii)
a free symbol which is a symbol other than a reserved symbol.
Clause 6 classifies recognized political parties either as a National
Party or a State Party. Clause 6A and 6B of the said Allotment
Order provides for eligibility for recognition as a State Party or a
National Party. Clause 6C provides for conditions for continued
recognition as a National Party or State Party. Clause 8 provides
for choice of symbols and allotment thereof, according to which a
candidate set up by a National Party or State Party in an election
shall be allotted the symbol reserved for that party and no other
symbol. The Allotment Order, 1968 also contains the provisions
for allotment of free symbols as well. Clause 17 mandates the
Election Commission to publish list in the Gazette of India
specifying the National Parties, State Parties and symbols reserved
for them.
16.    Thus, so far as recognition of political parties as a National
Party or a State Party is concerned, the Allotment Order, 1968
contains provisions empowering the Election Commission to do
17.    When we examine the impugned paragraphs 3 of the letters
of registration dated 19th September, 1989 and 23rd September,
1989, what we find is that the same owes its existence not to
section 29A of the Act but to the provisions contained in the
Second Amendment Order, 1989 issued on 11.08.1989 by the
Election Commission. Though the Second Amendment Order,
P.I.L Civil No.28404 of 2021                              page 11 of18
1989 is specifically mentioned the impugned paragraph 3 of the
letters of registration dated 19th September, 1989 and 23rd
September, 1989 issued with regard to two different political
parties, however, it appears that the said provision has completely
been overlooked by the petitioner. The entire basis of the instant
writ petition, in our considered opinion, is misreading of
paragraph 3 of the letters of registration dated 19th September,
1989 and 23rd September, 1989. It appears that the said
paragraphs 3 has been understood by the petitioner as if the same
has been issued by the Election Commission in exercise of its
power vested in section 29A of the Act and is thus referable to the
said provision. The provisions of the Second Amendment Order,
1989 have completely been overlooked by the petitioner.
18.    In order to properly appreciate the issue, it would be
appropriate to quote the entire Second Amendment Order, 1989
notified on 11.08.1989 which is extracted herein below:
O. N.73(E):- In exercise of the powers conferred by article
324 of the Constitution, read with section 29A of the
Representation of the People Act, 1951 (43 of 1951), and
rules 5 and 10 of the Conduct of Elections Rules, 1961, and
all other powers enabling it in this behalf, the Election
Commission of India hereby makes the following Order
further to amend the Election Symbols (Reservation and
Allotment) Order 1968, namely:-
1. Short title and commencement.- (1) This Order may be
called the Election Symbols (Reservation and Allotment)
(2) It shall come into force on the date of its publication in
the Gazette of India.
2. Amendment of paragraph 7 :- In the Election Symbols
(Reservation and Allotment) Order, 1968, in paragraph 7,
for sub-paragraphs (2) and (3) the following sub-
paragraphs shall be substituted, namely:-
"(2) Notwithstanding anything contained in sub-paragraph
(1), every political party which, immediately before the l5th
day of June, 1989 is a National Party, shall, on its
registration under section 29A of the Representation of the
People Act, 1951, be a National party and shall, subject to
the other provisions of this Order, continue to be so until it
ceases to be a National Party on the result of any general
election held after the said date.
(3) Notwithstanding anything contained in sub paragraph
(I), every political party which, immediately before the l5th
day of June, 1989, is a State party in a State, shall, on its
registration under section 29A of the Representation of the
People Act, 1951 be a State party in that state and shall
subject to the other provisions of this Order, continue to be
so until it ceases to be a State party in that State on the
result of any general election held after the said date."
19.    As per clause 1(2) of the Second Amendment Order, it came
into force on the date of its publication in Gazette of India. Second
Amendment Order was published on 11.08.1989 in the official
gazette. Thus, the same was enforced w.e.f. 11.08.1989. Clause 2
of the Second Amendment Order, 1989 amends paragraph/(clause)
7 of the principal Order of 1968. In paragraph 7, sub paragraphs 2
and 3 were substituted. Newly added sub paragraph 2 of paragraph
7 provides that every political party which was a National Party
immediately before the 15th day of June, 1989, on its registration
under section 29A of the Act shall be a National Party and shall
continue to be so until the same is ceased to be a National Party.
Similarly, newly added sub paragraph 3 of paragraph 7 provides
P.I.L Civil No.28404 of 2021                                    page 13 of18
that every political party which was a State Party immediately
before 15th day of June,1989, on its registration under section 29A
of the Act shall be a State Party in that State and shall continue to
be so until is ceased to be a State Party.
20.    The date 15th June of 1989 in newly added sub paragraphs
2 and 3 of the Order is of significance. It is noticeable at this
juncture itself that section 29A which was inserted in the
Representation of People Act by the Act 1 of 1989 came into force
w.e.f. 15.06.1989. Sub section 2(a) of section 29A provides that if
an association or a body was in existence at the commencement of
the Act 1 of 1989, such an association or body shall make an
application seeking its registration within 60 days next following
such commencement. Act 1 of 1989 came into force on 15th of
June, 1989. Thus, from the said date, within sixty days if any
association or body intended to seek registration, application could
have been made within sixty days from 15th of June, 1989. The
provision contained in newly added sub clauses 2 and 3 of the
Order thus was made with a purpose which has a rationale too.
The purpose was to maintain continuity of any association or a
body as a National or State Party, which was in existence before
15th of June, 1989 even after its registration as a National Party or
a State Party and to maintain continued reservation of election
symbol. This provision in the Order vide notification dated
11.08.1989 appears to have been made to avoid confusion which,
in the absence of continued recognition as a National Party or a
State Party and also in absence of continued reservation of
election symbols, would have arisen once a political party was
registered under section 29 of the Act.
21.    As already observed above, clause 3 of the letters of
registration dated 19th September, 1989 and 23rd September, 1989
P.I.L Civil No.28404 of 2021                              page 14 of18
clearly refer to Second Amendment Order, 1989 dated 11.08.1989.
We have,thus, no doubt in our mind that the impugned clause 3 of
these two letters of registration are not referable to section 29A of
the Act, rather they are referable to the provisions contained in the
newly added sub paragraphs 2 and 3 of Paragraph 7 of the order
vide notification issued on 11.08.1989 by the Election
22.    Submission of the petitioner that the impugned clause 3 of
the aforementioned letters of registration are beyond statutory
powers vested in the Election Commission under section 29A of
the Act may or may not be correct, however, that in itself will not
render these stipulations contained in paragraph 3 bad or without
jurisdiction for the reason that the same are referable to Second
Amendment Order, 1989. Submission of the petitioner that the
impugned clause 3 of two letters of registration are without
jurisdiction, is thus, highly misconceived.
23.    We may also note that it is not the case of the petitioner that
prior to issuance of the letters of registration dated 19th
September, 1989 and 23rd September, 1989 the political parties
concerned were not recognized as National Parties or their
symbols were not reserved. There is no challenge in this petition
to the recognition of the political parties or to their reserved
symbols. The challenge is only to the existence of clause 3 in the
letters of registration which as observed above, is referable to the
Second Amendment Order, 1989 and in our opinion the Election
Commission was well within its power and jurisdiction to have
provided for the same.
24.    Submission made by the petitioner based on the ground that
the impugned paragraphs 3 of the letters of registration is violative
of Article 14 of the Constitution of India as the same is itself
P.I.L Civil No.28404 of 2021                               page 15 of18
discriminatory, is also highly misconceived and is thus hereby
rejected for the reason that it has not been pleaded as to whether
the other political parties in respect of whom the letters of
registration have been issued (including Samajwadi Party to which
the petitioner belongs to) were recognized as National/State Party
or their elections symbols were reserved or by virtue of non-
existence of similar clause in their letters of registration, the
parties concerned have been de-recognized and their election
symbols have been de-reserved.
25.      For the reasons aforesaid, challenge made in this petition on
the ground of violation of Articles 19 and 21 of the Constitution of
India also fails. The petitioner has also submitted that in absence
of any statutory powers vested in the Election Commission of
India in the field covered by the Act, the power to recognize a
political party and to reserve the election symbol could not have
been exercised by the Election Commission. The said submission
is completely misconceived and is untenable. The recognition of a
political party as a National Party or a State Party and reservation
of election symbol are the functions which are exercised by the
Election Commission under the provisions of Election Symbols
(Reservation and Allotment) Order, 1968, as amended from time
to time.
26. The issue relating to the scope and powers in respect of
superintendence, directions and control of elections under Article
324 of the Constitution of India is no more res integra. A Division
Bench of this Court, in this regard, in the case of Shraddha
Tripathi, Advocate vs. the Election Commission of India and
others, Misc. Bench No.12092 of 2016 decided on 11.01.2021
has observed as under:
"As regards contention of the petitioner that the Election
Commission of India does not have any power to allot
P.I.L Civil No.28404 of 2021                                page 16 of18
symbols to a recognized National or State level political
party or to reserve a symbol for them, firstly, we are of the
view that Article 324 vests ample power on the Election
Commission of India for superintendence, direction and
control of elections and in this context if such reservation
or allotment is made it is in furtherance of the
constitutional goal contained in Part XV of the
Constitution of India. The only limitation is that this
exercise of power cannot violate any constitutional or
statutory provision or any rule made there under. We have
already noticed that there is no such violation by the
Election Commission of India in issuing Order, 1968 for
allotment and reservation of symbols. There is no provision
in the Act, 1951 or the Rules, 1961 which prohibits the
Commission from reserving or allotting symbols as has
been done by the Order, 1968. In fact, the said Act, 1951
and the Rules, 1961, hint or suggest such reservation and
allotment of symbols, as already noticed. Vires of the Act,
1951 or Rules, 1961 are not under challenge before us. We
therefore reject this contention. In fact, the vires of Order,
1968 was put to challenge before the Supreme Court of
India in the case of Kanhiya Lal Omar Vs. R.K. Trivedi
and others, 1985 (4) SCC 628. The Order, 1968 was held to
be intra vires the Constitution, the Act, 1951 and the Rules,
27.     Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Desiya Murpokku
Dravida Kazhagam and another vs. Election Commission of
India, reported in [(2012) 7 SCC 340] in paragraphs 14, 49 and
50 has observed as under:
"14. The authority of the Election Commission under the
Election Symbols Order, 1968 as a whole was also
challenged before this Court in Kanhiya Lal Omar v. R.K.
Trivedi [(1985) 4 SCC 628] , wherein it was urged on behalf
of the petitioner that the said Order, being legislative in
character, could not have been issued by the Election
Commission, which was not entrusted by law with power to
issue such an Order regarding the specification,
reservation, choice and allotment of symbols that might be
chosen by the candidates during elections in the
parliamentary and assembly constituencies. It was also
urged that Article 324 of the Constitution which vests the
power of superintendence, direction and control of all
elections to Parliament and to the Legislative Assemblies, in
the Commission, could not be construed as conferring
power on the Commission to issue the Symbols Order.
Rejecting the said contention, this Court held that the
expression “election” in Article 324 of the Constitution is
used in a wide sense so as to include the entire process of
P.I.L Civil No.28404 of 2021                                    page 17 of18
election which consists of several stages, some of which had
an important bearing on the result of the process and that
every norm which laid down a Code of Conduct could not
possibly be elevated to the status of legislation or even
delegated legislation. It was emphasised that there are
certain authorities or persons who may be the source of
rules of conduct and who at the same time could not be
equated with authorities or persons who are entitled to
make law in the strict sense.
49. The submissions made on behalf of the writ
petitioners regarding the constitutional validity of the
Election Symbols Order, 1968, and the power of the
Election Commission to settle issues relating to claims of
splinter groups to be the original party, had fallen for the
decision of this Court about forty years ago in Sadiq Ali
case [(1972) 4 SCC 664] , when this Court had occasion to
observe that the Election Commission had been clothed
with plenary powers by Rules 5 and 10 of the Conduct of
Elections Rules, 1961 in the matter of conducting of
elections, which included the power to allot symbols to
candidates during elections. The challenge to the vires of
the Symbols Order, 1968 was, accordingly, repelled.
50. The view in Sadiq Ali case [(1972) 4 SCC 664] has since
been followed inAll Party Hill Leaders' Conference
case[(1977) 4 SCC 161] , Roop Lal Sathi case[(1982) 3 SCC
487] , Kanhiya Lal Omar case [(1985) 4 SCC 628] and as
recently as in Subramanian Swamy case [(2008) 14 SCC
318] , to which reference has been made in the earlier part
of this judgment, where the provisions of Article 324 of the
Constitution vesting the superintendence, direction and
control of elections, were considered in detail and it was,
inter alia, held that in addition to Rules 5 and 10 of the
Conduct of Elections Rules, 1961, the powers vested in the
Election Commission could be traced to Article 324 of the
28.    Thus,      the argument of the petitioner that the Election
Commission does not have any authority to recognize a political
party or to reserve an election symbol also fails.
29.    For the discussions made and reasons given above, we find
that the writ petition is highly misconceived which is hereby
