+       W.P.(C) 584/2023 with CM APPLs. 2281/2023, 2282/2023
1.      The present writ petition has been filed with grievance that
name of the petitioner child has been struck off from the school due to
non-payment of fees and despite the fact that the petitioner is a student
of Class 10th. The petition has been listed upon urgent mentioning
since the Class 10th Board Examination (Practical Exams) are
scheduled from tomorrow i.e. 18.01.2023, which constitute substantial
part of the upcoming final Class 10th Board Examination. Thus, the
present petition has been filed with prayer for direction to the
respondent No. 1 school to reinstate the petitioner as a student on its
rolls and allow the petitioner child to sit in the upcoming CBSE Board
Exams for Class 10th.
2.      It is the case on behalf of the petitioner that the petitioner has
been studying in the respondent No. 1 school since the Academic Year
2011-12. The petitioner has made all the past payments of the school
fees in a time bound manner till before the onset of Covid – 19. Thus,
the fees till January, 2021 has been cleared by the petitioner.
3.      It is the case of the petitioner that due to the financial losses
faced by his father, he was unable to clear the fees regularly after the
pandemic lockdown. In view thereof, the respondent No. 1 school
issued letter dated 29.08.2022 to the petitioner in regard to the
pending fee amount of the petitioner along with recommendation of
striking off the name of the petitioner from the rolls of the school.
Further, the respondent No. 1 school also sent an e-mail dated
30.08.2022, wherein it again recommended striking off the name of
the petitioner.
4.      On receipt of the aforesaid e-mails, the petitioner’s father
approached the Directorate of Education (in short ‘DOE’) and made a
representation dated 05.09.2022. He prayed to the DOE for direction
to the school to allow the petitioner to attend his classes and not strike
off the name of the petitioner from the roll of the school.
5.      However, the respondent No. 1 school by letter dated
07.09.2022 informed the father of the petitioner that name of the
W.P.(C) 584/2023                                                       Page 2 of 11
petitioner had been struck off from the rolls of the school. Thus, the
father of the petitioner again approached the respondent No. 2 – DOE.
Subsequently, the respondent No. 2- DOE issued a letter dated
12.09.2022 to the respondent No. 1 school requesting the school to
roll back the names of all students whose names had been struck off
from the rolls of the school due to delay/ non-payment of fees. The
school was further requested to allow the students to continue their
studies/ examination in the school.
6.      Father of the petitioner also made a complaint to the Delhi
Commission for Protection of Child Rights (in short ‘DCPCR’). In
response to the complaint, the DCPCR took cognizance of the matter
and issued interim directions keeping in view the urgency of the
situation. The DCPCR by its order dated 13.09.2022 directed that the
school shall not bar any student from appearing in ongoing half-yearly
exams, pending inquiry by the commission.
7.      Subsequently, the respondent No. 1 school vide e-mails dated
14.09.2022 and 16.09.2022 permitted the petitioner herein to appear
for the half yearly examinations and also allowed the petitioner to
attend the classes.
8.      Subsequently, however the name of the petitioner was again
struck off by the school, which was informed to the petitioner vide e-
mail dated 19.11.2022. It is submitted that after receipt of the
aforesaid e-mail, the father of the petitioner made numerous attempts
to request the school authorities to allow the petitioner to attend the
classes. However, the respondent No. 1 school did not allow the
petitioner to either attend the school, nor is now allowing the
W.P.(C) 584/2023                                                    Page 3 of 11
petitioner to take the Class 10th Practical Board Examination
commencing from tomorrow i.e. 18.01.2023.
9.      Ms. Mehak Nakra, ASC(Civil) GNCTD appearing on advance
notice submitted that the DOE has already written a letter dated
12.09.2022 to the school directing the respondent No. 1 school to roll
back the names of all the students whose names had been struck off
and allow the students to continue their studies in school as well as to
allow them to sit for the examinations. Thus, she submits that the
DOE is supporting the case of the petitioner in that the petitioner may
not be barred from either attending the school or from appearing in the
10.     At the outset, Mr. Pramod Gupta, Advocate appearing on
advance notice on behalf of respondent No. 1 school has vehemently
opposed the present petition. He submits that large amounts of sums
towards fees are due and payable not only by the petitioner, but his
sister also who passed out in the last Academic Session i.e. 2021-22.
Learned counsel has handed over a chart showing the dues payable by
the petitioner as well as his sister, amounting to a total of
Rs.3,14,000/-. He submits that this amount which is due and payable
from the petitioner and his sister is a large amount, which can fund the
monthly salary of at least four teachers. The respondent No. 1 school
is a private unaided school and it is not possible for the school to
impart education if the students are not regular in payment of their
11.     He further submits that since the DCPCR issued orders against
the school, the respondent No. 1 school was constrained to approach
W.P.(C) 584/2023                                                     Page 4 of 11
this Court by way of a writ petition, W.P.(C) No. 16940/2022 titled as
„The Indian School vs. Delhi Commission for Protection of Child
Rights and Ors.‟. It is submitted that the said petition is still pending
and is now listed on 22.03.2023.
12.     Learned counsel for respondent No. 1 further draws the
attention of this Court to e-mail dated 31.08.2022 received from the
father of the petitioner, wherein it is stated that tuition fees qua the
petitioner had been paid by his father from April, 2022 to August,
2022. By way of the said e-mail, father of the petitioner assured the
school that due to some financial issues, payment of fees was delayed
and that he shall pay rest of the fees as soon as possible. Thus, it is
submitted that despite the assurance given to the school, the petitioner
has not paid the upto date fees of the school, resulting in huge arrears
due and payable to the school. The school has further been constrained
to file a suit for recovery in the District Court, Saket against father of
the petitioner for the amounts payable to the school.
13.     Learned counsel for respondent No. 1 school also draws the
attention of this Court to Rule 35 of Delhi School Education Rules,
1973 (in short ‘DSER’) to contend that the name of the petitioner has
been struck off in exercise of the power as envisaged under Rule 35 of
the said Rules. As per Rule 35 of DSER, 1973, the name of a student
may be struck off the rolls by the Head of the school on account of
non-payment of fees and other dues.
14.     Learned counsel for respondent No. 1 relies upon order dated
27.05.2022 passed by Division Bench of this Court in W.P.(C) No.
8466/2022, wherein it has been categorically held that Rule 35 does
W.P.(C) 584/2023                                                       Page 5 of 11
not impinge upon the operation of the Right to Education (RTE) Act.
In the said judgment, Division Bench of this Court has held that the
petitioner therein is free to take admission in a Government school, if
he cannot afford to pay the fees of the private unaided school.
15.     Similarly, learned counsel for respondent No. 1 also relies upon
order dated 23.02.2022 in W.P.(C) No. 3330/2022 and order dated
06.09.2022 in W.P.(C) 3858/2022 passed by Coordinate Benches of
this Court, wherein this Court has directed the parents of the
petitioners therein to make payment towards the outstanding fees by
way of monthly instalments or payment of lumpsum amounts.
16.     I have heard the learned counsels for the parties. With the
consent of the parties, the matter is taken up for final disposal.
17.     Education has been held to be essentially a charitable object, a
kind of service to the community. Supreme Court in the case of
T.M.A. Pai Foundation vs. State of Karnataka, 2002 SCC OnLine
SC 1036 has held as follows:
“20. Article 19(1)(g) employs four expressions viz. profession,
occupation, trade and business. Their fields may overlap, but
each of them does have a content of its own. Education is per
se regarded as an activity that is charitable in nature (see State
of Bombay v. R.M.D. Chamarbaugwala [AIR 1957 SC 699 :
1957 SCR 874] ). Education has so far not been regarded as a
trade or business where profit is the motive. Even if there is any
doubt about whether education is a profession or not, it does
appear that education will fall within the meaning of the
expression “occupation”. Article 19(1)(g) uses the four
expressions so as to cover all activities of a citizen in respect of
which income or profit is generated, and which can
consequently be regulated under Article 19(6). In Webster's
Third New International Dictionary, at p. 1650, “occupation”
W.P.(C) 584/2023                                                         Page 6 of 11
is, inter alia, defined as “an activity in which one engages” or
“a craft, trade, profession or other means of earning a
living”.”
18.     Thus, a child cannot be made to suffer and not be allowed to
attend classes or barred from taking examinations in the middle of an
academic session on the ground of non-payment of fees. Education is
the foundation, which shapes the future of a child and which in turn
shapes the future of the society in general. Therefore, not allowing a
student to take examinations, especially the Board Examinations,
would be infringement of the rights of a child akin to Right to Life as
guaranteed under Article 21 of the Constitution of India. Supreme
Court has expanded the rights under Article 21 of Constitution of
India and education is certainly one of the important rights which
would be encompassed under right to life. In furtherance of the same,
Article 21A of the Constitution of India provides for Right to
Education, wherein the State has been ordained to provide free and
compulsory education to all children of the age of 6 to 14 years.
19.     Supreme Court in the case of Bandhua Mukti Morcha vs.
Union of India and Ors., (1984) 3 SCC 161 has held as follows:
“10. ...... It is the fundamental right of everyone in this country,
assured under the interpretation given to Article 21 by this
Court         in Francis      Mullin     case [Francis       Coralie
Mullin v. Administrator, UT of Delhi, (1981) 1 SCC 608 : 1981
SCC (Cri) 212] to live with human dignity, free from
exploitation. This right to live with human dignity enshrined in
Article 21 derives its life breath from the Directive Principles of
State Policy and particularly clauses (e) and (f) of Article 39
and Articles 41 and 42 and at the least, therefore, it must
include protection of the health and strength of workers, men
and women, and of the tender age of children against abuse,
W.P.(C) 584/2023                                                         Page 7 of 11
opportunities and facilities for children to develop in a healthy
manner and in conditions of freedom and dignity, educational
facilities, just and humane conditions of work and maternity
relief. These are the minimum requirements which must exist in
order to enable a person to live with human dignity and no
State — neither the Central Government nor any State
Government — has the right to take any action which will
deprive a person of the enjoyment of these basic essentials. ....”
20.     A child’s future cannot be allowed to be spoiled and blemished
by barring him/ her from taking examinations, especially at such a
crucial juncture. In the context of Indian Society, Class 10 th and Class
12th Board Examinations are vitally important and critical, having
decisive repercussions and bearing on the future of a student.
21.     At the same time, a school which is run as a private unaided
school cannot be forced to continue with a child who is unable to pay
fees, having taken admission in the general quota and not under the
Economically Weaker Section (EWS) or Disadvantaged Group (DG)
quota. The constitutionality and validity of Rule 35 of DSER, 1973,
which authorises the Head of the school to strike off the name of a
student from the rolls of the school on account of non-payment of
fees, has not been struck down by any Court of law.
22.     Division Bench of this Court in the case of Master Divyam
Bhateja through father Mr. Vinod Bhateja vs. Bhai Parmanand
Vidya Mandir and Ors., MANU/DE/2900/2022 in W.P. (C)
8466/2022 by order dated 27.05.2022, while rejecting the challenge
to the vires of Rule 35 of DSER, 1973 has held as follows:
“9. Given the independent and distinct framework of Delhi
School Education Act and the Rules framed thereunder, and the
W.P.(C) 584/2023                                                        Page 8 of 11
RTE Act and the rules framed thereunder, there can be no
question of Rules 35 and 167 of Delhi School Education Rules
impinging upon the operation of the RTE Act. The RTE Act
guarantees the right to education. However, it nowhere
provides that the said right can be unconditionally enforced
against a private unaided school. The petitioner is free to take
admission in a government school if he cannot afford to pay the
fee of the private unaided school. If he is entitled to admission
in the EWS category, he may apply under that category to seek
waiver of the school fee. If the claim of the petitioner were to be
allowed, if would mean that even a private unaided school
would not be able to charge any fee even though they have to
meet all their expenses from their own resources and
accretions. This is completely untenable.
10. Likewise, the impugned Rules 35 and 167 of Delhi School
Education Schools do not impinge upon or affect in any manner
the operation of Sections 75 of Juvenile Justice Act. The said
provision has been enacted in a completely different
context.........”
23.     Therefore, the rights of a child to education has to be balanced
with the rights of the school under the DSER, 1973. If the petitioner is
unable to pay the fees of the school, the petitioner certainly does not
have a right to continue education in the school in question. However,
the petitioner cannot be tormented in this manner in the middle of the
academic session. The academic year of the petitioner cannot be
allowed to be wasted, since the current academic session is almost at
its end. Further, it is also pertinent to note that the petitioner is
currently in Class 10th, for which registration with the CBSE for
appearing in Class 10th Board Examination has already taken place.
Therefore, at this juncture, the petitioner cannot be directed to take
admission in a new school, when the current academic session has
W.P.(C) 584/2023                                                        Page 9 of 11
almost ended and the Board Examinations are round the corner. Not
allowing the petitioner to take up the Board Examinations would put
the petitioner at a great hardship and the petitioner would suffer
irreparable harm if he is not allowed to take up the examination.
Therefore, considering the facts and circumstances of the present case,
it is deemed expedient that the prayers as made in the present writ
petition are allowed and the petitioner child is permitted to take the
24.      However, it is noted that the petitioner has approached this
Court at a belated stage despite the fact that name of the petitioner had
been struck off by the school firstly by way of letter dated 07.09.2022
and subsequently, by way of letter dated 19.11.2022. This Court
deprecates the conduct of the petitioner in approaching this Court at
the eleventh hour, when the Practical Board Examinations are to
commence from tomorrow onwards.
25.     Nevertheless, taking a compassionate and sympathetic view,
considering the fact that the petitioner is a minor child studying in
Class 10th and the Academic Year of the petitioner will be wasted in
case this Court does not intervene in the matter, it is directed that the
petitioner child shall be allowed by the respondent No.1 school to take
up the Practical Board Examinations of Class 10th commencing from
tomorrow i.e. 18.01.2023. Further, the school shall also issue the Class
10th CBSE Roll Number to the petitioner to enable the petitioner to
take up the Class 10th Board Examinations. The school shall also
allow the petitioner child to attend any classes/ special classes that
may be held by the school for imparting education to the children for
W.P.(C) 584/2023                                                      Page 10 of 11
appearing in Class 10th Board Examinations.
26.     However, in order to balance the equities, it is considered
imperative that the petitioner pays some amount towards the fees
payable to the school. In the facts and circumstances of the case, since
it has been expressed on behalf of the father of the petitioner that the
family is undergoing financial constraints, it is directed that the
petitioner shall pay an amount of Rs.30,000/- to the school within a
period of four weeks from today on account of the dues payable to the
school towards the fees.
27.     The present writ petition is disposed of in the aforesaid terms
along with all the pending applications.
