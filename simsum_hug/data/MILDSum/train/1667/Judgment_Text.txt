For an incident which occurred on 21/22.7.2014,
information was given by the Station House Officer, Nevdhia,
District Jaunpur to the Superintendent of Police, Jaunpur that he
had got a report through his mobile phone on 23.7.2014 that the
petitioner under influence of alcohol has misbehaved with the
private cook Shamshad Ahmad. The petitioner thereafter was
suspended on 23.7.2014. A preliminary enquiry was undergone
by a retired police officer by the name of Sagir Ahmad who
submitted his report on 28.10.2014 finding a prima facie case
against the petitioner. On the basis of the preliminary report, the
enquiry was allotted on 20.6.2017 to Sri Sanjay Rai, Additional
Superintendent of Police, Rural, Jaunpur by the Superintendent of
Police, Jaunpur. A charge sheet was prepared on 28.7.2017 and
was handed over to the petitioner on 1.8.2017. For the conducting
of the enquiry dates were fixed on 1.8.2017, 16.8.2017, 3.9.2017,
21/23.12.2017, 6.1.2018, 17.1.2018, 18.2.2018 and 18/20.3.2018.
Thereafter enquiry report was submitted on 24.4.2018 by the
Enquiry Officer finding the petitioner guilty of the charges levied
against him and a major punishment of removal was proposed
under Rule 4(1) of the Uttar Pradesh Police Officers of the
Subordinate Ranks (Punishment and Appeal) Rules, 1991. On
30.4.2018, a show-cause notice was issued to the petitioner for
his reply. Upon receiving the show-cause notice, the petitioner
submitted his reply on 7.7.2018. Thereafter the punishment order
was passed against the petitioner and he was removed from
service vide order dated 27.8.2018. The appeal filed by the
petitioner was dismissed on 17.10.2018 and similarly the revision
filed by him was also dismissed on 25.1.2019. Aggrieved thereof,
the petitioner had filed the instant writ petition.
Contention of learned counsel for the petitioner is that the
enquiry was a sham enquiry inasmuch as the enquiry was being
undergone in Jaunpur and the petitioner was posted at Varanasi
from where he was unable to get leave to attend the enquiry.
What is more, it has been stated that no eye-witness of the
incident had been examined by the Enquiry Officer. The only
persons who were examined as witnesses by the Enquiry Officer
were Vishwajeet Pratap Singh, the Station House Officer who
had by his mobile phone informed the Superintendent of Police
on 23.7.2014 about the incident which had taken place on
21/22.7.2014 and the private cook Shamshad Ahmad. It has been
contended by learned counsel for the petitioner that no other
witness was examined. Still further, it is the contention of the
learned counsel for the petitioner that only a medical report which
was based on smell coming from the petitioner of alcohol was
relied upon. The blood test and the urine test of the petitioner
were not undertaken and, therefore, it cannot with any certainty
be said that the petitioner was guilty of having consumed alcohol.
Still further, it is the contention of learned counsel for the
petitioner that if the incident of slapping etc. had taken place
when the petitioner was inebriated then a First Information
Report ought to have been lodged which in fact was never
lodged. Learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that the
paragraph 31 of the writ petition, which had categorically stated
that no medical officer was examined and also the sample of
blood or urine was not used to prove the allegations, was not
replied to in the counter affidavit. Learned counsel for the
petitioner submits that as per the judgments reported in (1971) 3
SCC 930 : Bachubhai Hassanalli Karyani vs. State of
vs. State of Punjab and AIR 2010 SC 1812 : R.
Venkatakrishnan vs. Central Bureau of Investigation, the law
is certain that the prosecution must stand on its own legs basing
its findings on the evidence that has been led by it. It matters little
as to whether the accused has made out a plausible defence or
not. Learned counsel for the petitioner relying upon a decision of
the Constitution Bench of Supreme Court in Union of India vs.
H.C. Goel reported in AIR 1964 SC 364 submitted that suspicion
cannot be allowed to take the place of proof even in domestic
enquiries. Since, learned counsel for the petitioner cited a certain
paragraph of the judgment reported in AIR 1964 SC 364, the
".......mere suspicion should not be allowed to take
the place of proof even in domestic enquiries. It may
be that the technical rules which govern criminal
trials in courts may not necessarily apply to
disciplinary proceedings, but nevertheless, the
principle that in punishing the guilty scrupulous care
must be taken to see that the innocent are not
punished, applies as must to regular criminal trials as
to disciplinary enquiries held under the statutory
Learned counsel for the petitioner, therefore, submitted
that the charge was not proved to the hilt and, therefore, it cannot
be presumed that the petitioner was guilty of the charges.
Learned Standing Counsel, however, in reply submitted
that if the petitioner chooses not to appear and to reply to the
charge sheet, then the Police Department had no other option but
to presume that the charges were proved.
Having heard Sri Pawan Giri, Advocate holding brief of
learned counsel for the petitioner and the learned Standing
Counsel and after having gone through the written arguments, I
am of the view that the impugned order dated 27.8.2018 passed
by the Superintendent of Police, Jaunpur, the order dated
17.10.2018 passed by the Inspector General of Police, Varanasi
Zone, Varanasi and the order dated 25.1.2019 passed by the
Additional Director General of Police, Varanasi Zone, Varanasi
cannot be sustained in the eyes of law. Even if the petitioner had
not replied to the charges and had not appeared on the dates fixed
when the enquiry was undergone, it was the bounden duty of the
Enquiry Officer to have seen whether the charges were proved on
the basis of the evidence which was led by it. The cook was a
person affected. The police officer namely Vishwajeet Pratap
Singh was only a person who had informed the Superintendent of
Police, Jaunpur on 23.7.2014 about the incident of slapping etc.
which took place on 21/22 July 2014. He was not an eye-witness.
Further no individual who had seen the incident was summoned
as an eye-witness to prove the incident. Also, there was only a
medical report that there was a suspicion on account of the fact
that there was a smell coming of alcohol from the petitioner while
there was no blood report or urine report of the petitioner which
actually would have proved that the petitioner had actually
consumed liquor/alcohol to an extent that he was in a state of
drunkenness.
For the reasons stated above, the order dated 27.8.2018
passed by the Superintendent of Police, Jaunpur, the order dated
17.10.2018 passed by the Inspector General of Police, Varanasi
Zone, Varanasi and the order dated 25.1.2019 passed by the
Additional Director General of Police, Varanasi Zone, Varanasi
are quashed and are set-aside.
The writ petition is, accordingly, allowed.
