2.             Aggrieved by an order passed by the High Court of
Judicature at Patna dismissing a petition under Section 482 of
the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (for short “Cr.P.C”) for
quashing an FIR registered at the instance of the second
respondent herein, the appellants have come up with the above
appeal.
appellants, the learned standing counsel for the State of Bihar
and the learned standing counsel appearing on behalf of the
respondent No.2, who was the complainant.
4.    The respondent No.2 was engaged by appellant no.1 as its
Carrying and Forwarding agent (C&F), on certain terms and
conditions, reduced into writing. The agreement continued from
time to time until February­2012.
5.    Thereafter disputes arose between appellant No.1 and
respondent No.2 which led to appellant No.1 filing a civil suit on
the file of the High Court of Judicature at Bombay, in CS
No.1432 of 2012. In the said suit, the High Court passed an
order appointing a Court Receiver to take possession of the goods
including medicines belonging to appellant No.1, which were in
the possession of respondent no.2. The Court Receiver seems to
have executed the warrant and recovered possession of certain
goods, the details of which are not relevant for our present
6.    Apart from filing a civil suit, appellant No.1 also filed a
criminal complaint against respondent No.2 for alleged offences
under Sections 406 and 420 IPC. By an order dated 14.08.2013,
the learned Chief Judicial Magistrate, Patna took cognizance and
issued summons to respondent No.2.
7.    Thereafter respondent No.2 filed a criminal complaint before
the learned Chief Judicial Magistrate, Patna. On 12.12.2013, the
learned Chief Judicial Magistrate, Patna passed an order
directing the copy of the complaint to be forwarded to the
Patliputra Police Station, for registration of an FIR against the
appellants herein. Pursuant to the said order, the Patliputra
Police Station registered an FIR in Crime No.17 of 2014 on
07.01.2014, against the appellants herein, for alleged offences
under Sections 406, 420, 408, 460, 471, 384, 311, 193, 196 read
8.    Challenging the FIR so registered, the appellants filed a
petition in Criminal Miscellaneous Petition No.13742 of 2014 on
the file of the High Court of Judicature at Patna, under Section
482 Cr.P.C seeking the quashing of the same. When the said
petition came up for final hearing in the year 2018, the Court
was informed that the police had already filed a charge­sheet and
that the Chief Judicial Magistrate had taken cognizance of the
9.    In the light of the subsequent development as aforesaid, the
High Court of Judicature at Patna dismissed the quash petition
on the only ground that it was not proper to keep the matter
pending any further. The High Court did not choose to go into
the merits of the contentions, despite the fact that appellant No.1
moved an application in IA No.1015 of 2014 for bringing on
record the charge­sheet and also for inclusion of a prayer for
quashing the charge­sheet.
10. Aggrieved by such a disposal of their quash petition, the
appellants are before this Court.
11. The primary contention of Mr. Mukul Rohatgi and Mr.
Gopal Jain, learned senior counsel appearing for the appellants
is: (i) that the complaint filed by respondent No.2 does not
disclose the commission of any offence; (ii) that the complaint
filed by respondent No.2 was only a counter blast to the civil suit
filed by appellant No.1 and a criminal complaint lodged by the
appellants against respondent No.2; (iii) that the High Court
overlooked the pendency of an application for bringing on record
the charge­sheet and for the inclusion of a prayer for quashing of
the charge­sheet.
12. In response, it is contended by Mr. Narender Hooda, learned
senior counsel for respondent No.2 that though the appellants
moved an application for bringing on record the subsequent
development of filing of the charge­sheet and also for inclusion of
a prayer for quashing the charge­sheet, the appellants were
negligent in not pressing for the same at the time of hearing of
the quash petition. According to the learned senior counsel for
respondent No.2, the appellants sought adjournment on several
occasions, without pressing for an order in the Interlocutory
Application and that therefore the Court found it not proper to
keep the quash petition pending, impeding the trial.
13. Before going into rival contentions, it would be appropriate
to have a look at the criminal complaint filed by respondent No.2
on the file of the Chief Judicial Magistrate, Patna, under Section
200 Cr.P.C, which formed the foundation for the Magistrate
passing an order under Section 156(3) Cr.P.C, the registration of
the FIR by the police and the filing of the charge­sheet. In sum
and substance, what was alleged in the said complaint was as
(i)     that respondent No.2 is a Clearing and Forwarding
agent for different pharmaceutical companies;
(ii)    that appellant No.1 hired the services of respondent
No.2 as its Clearing and Forwarding agent to carry
out various tasks including the storage of medicines
in the godown, distribution of the same and
corresponding with the Government.
(iii)  that appellant No.1 acquired another company
which had taken on rent, a godown situate in the
campus               of            Patna
(iv)   that at the instance of the appellants, respondent
No.2 provided manpower for the distribution of the
products of appellant No.1 and they worked under
the supervision of the managerial staff of appellant
(v)    that   certain  service  charges   were  payable  to
respondent No.2 for the services so rendered;
(vi)   that in the meantime the rental agreement for the
godown expired and hence respondent No.2 was not
allowed to store the drugs in the godown;
(vii)  that on account of the same, the agreement
executed by appellant No.1 in favour of respondent
No.2 became inoperative;
(viii) that through a supplementary agreement dated
26.11.2004, new conditions were incorporated;
(ix)   that at the time of execution of the supplementary
agreement, it was assured that on and from
1.04.2005, respondent no.2 will be entitled to get
the entire work handed over to them by having the
custody of the godown;
(x)    that the appellant No.1 also took a bank guarantee
from respondent no.2 in a sum of Rs.5,00,000/­
(xi)   that without any prior intimation to respondent
no.2, the appellants locked up the godown in 2012.
(xii)   that respondent No.2 came to know about a new
warehousing agreement entered into by appellant
No.1 behind the back of respondent No.2;
(xiii)  that whenever respondent No.2 raised a question of
execution of power of attorney in their favour, the
appellants threatened to terminate the agency,
forcing     the   respondent   No.2  to   part  with
Rs.2,00,000/­per annum;
(xiv)   that due to the non­execution of the power of
attorney from 2004 till 2012, respondent No.2 could
not act as C&F agent;
(xv)    that the appellants made use of the furniture and
fixtures belonging to respondent No.2 kept in the
godown.
(xvi)   that for appointing them as C&F agent, the
appellants demanded Rs.12 lakhs, but respondent
No.2 refused to pay;
(xvii)  that on 28.02.2012, the Regional Distribution
Manager of appellant No.1 locked the godown and
relieved respondent No.2.
(xviii) that the furniture and fixtures of respondent No.2
are still inside the godown; and
(xix)   that all the above acts showed that the appellants
conspired together and committed the offences of
cheating, forgery and breach of trust.
14. A careful reading of the complaint, the gist of which we have
extracted above would show that none of the ingredients of any of
the offences complained against the appellants are made out.
Even if all the averments contained in the complaint are taken to
be true, they do not make out any of the offences alleged against
the appellants.    Therefore, we do not know how an FIR was
registered and a charge­sheet was also filed.
15. The contention of the learned senior counsel for respondent
No.2 that the Court has to take note of the final report filed by
the police along with the statement of witnesses, could have been
accepted by us, if the whole thing had emanated from a First
Information lodged with the police. Respondent No.2 actually
filed a private complaint under Section 200 Cr.P.C, which was
referred by the Court under Section 156(3) to the police. When
this complaint itself disclosed nothing more than a commercial
relationship which broke, it is not possible for respondent No.2 to
enlarge the scope of his complaint by merely adding the language
used in the text of the Indian Penal Code.
16. Admittedly appellant No.1 had instituted a civil Suit on the
file of the judicature at Bombay and also obtained an order for
the appointment of a Court Receiver to take possession of the
goods lying in the godown. The appellants have also lodged a
criminal complaint, which was refused to be quashed by the High
Court of Patna. It is only after the appellants filed a civil suit and
a criminal complaint that respondent No.2 chose to file his
17. The High Court was clearly in error in overlooking the
application for bringing on record the subsequent development of
the filing of the charge­sheet and the prayer for inclusion of the
relief of quashing of the charge­sheet in the original petition.
18. It is too late in the day to seek support from any precedents,
for the proposition that if no offence is made out by a careful
reading of the complaint, the complaint deserves to be quashed.
19. Therefore, the appeal is allowed. The impugned order of the
High Court is set aside and the FIR and the charge­sheet against
the appellants are quashed. There will be no order to costs.
