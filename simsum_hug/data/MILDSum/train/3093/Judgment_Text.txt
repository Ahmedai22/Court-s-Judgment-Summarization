Facts of Criminal Appeal No. 203 of 2022 and the
affidavits filed therein
4.    The facts that formed the bedrock of this case are that a
first Information Report No. 0261/2021 was lodged on
22.08.2021 by the father of the victim against Waseem, Saniv,
Nazeev, Shafeek and Nazim under Section 452, 376D, 3(2)(V)
S.C./S.T. Act and ¾ POCSO Act at police station-Tanda, district-
Rampur making allegations of gang rape against them. Victim
in her statement under Section 164 Cr.P.C dated 24.08.2021
has also made allegation of gang rape on her by the aforesaid
five named accused, but investigating officer ignoring the
statement under Section 164 Cr.P.C. of the victim submitted
police report under Section 173(2) Cr.P.C./charge sheet dated
20.10.2021 only against Waseem and remaining four accused
have been exonerated. On 09.5.2022, learned Additional
Government Advocate was directed to file an affidavit disclosing
therein the specific grounds on which co-accused Saniv,
Nazeev, Shafeek and Nazim have been exonerated by the
investigating officer when there is specific allegation of rape
against them by the victim in her statement under Section 164
Cr.P.C. On 17.05.2022 when the case was taken up, learned
counsel appearing on behalf of the informant apprised the
Court that after taking note of the defective investigation
conducted by the investigating officer and on putting query in
this regard by this Court by order dated 09.05.2022, one Sub-
Inspector Adesh of police station Tanda, district Rampur at the
behest of the investigating officer and in collusion with the
accused persons is mounting pressure upon the informant and
the victim for not pursuing the case and made allegation
against the investigating officer. It is also submitted that Sub-
Inspector Adesh visited several times to the house of the victim
for the said purpose. The victim and her family members are
under constant threat of their lives and liberty. The statement
of victim under Section 161 Cr.P.C. was not recorded by audio-
video means with a view to extend undue favour to the
accused     persons,    whereas     provisions  of   recording the
statement under Section 161 Cr.P.C. by audio-video means was
inserted by the Act No. 5 of 2009 with effect from 31.12.2009
and similar provision has also been provided under sub Section
(10) of Section 15A of the S.C./S.T. Act, but the aforesaid
mandatory provisions have not been complied with. In view of
the above, informant and victim were given opportunity to file
their respective affidavits. The Superintendent of Police,
Rampur, Dharma Singh Marchal, the Investigating Officer of this
case and Sub-Inspector Adesh of police station Tanda, District
Rampur were also directed to appear in person before this
Court on 26.05.2022 and to file their personal affidavit in the
matter. Superintendent of Police, Rampur was also directed to
file an affidavit indicating that in the last one year in how many
cases amended provisions of Section 161 Cr.P.C. and provisions
of sub Section (10) of Section 15A of S.C./S.T. Act have been
complied with in true sense and in how many cases, the said
provisions have not been followed.
5.     Shri Virender, son of the complainant has filed his
personal affidavit dated 22.5.2022 mentioning inter alia that
investigation has been conducted with ulterior motive in
collusion with the accused persons. Sub Inspector Adesh Kumar
is closely associated with Aquil, who is father of the co-accused
Nazeev, who used to pressurize the informant and his son to
compromise the matter. On 26.05.2022 Mr. Ashok Kumar, the
Superintendent of Police, Rampur, Mr. Dharm Singh Marchhal,
Additional Superintendent of Police, the investigating officer of
the case and Mr. Adesh Kumar, Sub-inspector of Police station

that statement of the victim was recorded under Section 161
Cr.P.C. by audio and video clippings, and the same was sent to
the Court on 26.05.2022. The pen drive of the audio and video
clippings, was summoned from the court concerned and it was
displayed in the presence of the learned counsel for the parties
and it was found that the statement of the victim recorded
through audio video means does not match with the contents
of the statement recorded under Section 161 Cr.P.C.
6.     He also tendered his unconditional and unqualified
apology for submitting police report under Section 173(2)
Cr.P.C. ignoring the statement under Section 164 Cr.P.C. of the

allegations levelled against him by the victim and stated that a
bald allegation has been levelled against him without there
being any substance or evidence to this effect. However, on
putting query by this Court, he has admitted that he is in touch
with Aquil, who is the father of accused Nazeev.
8.     Mr. Ashok Kumar Singh, the Superintendent of Police,
Rampur has come up with a stand in his affidavit that he has
joined the post of Superintendent of Police, Rampur on
17.04.2022. He, vide order dated 20.5.2022, has instituted an
enquiry against the Sub-Inspector Adesh Kumar and Circle

no such mistake may occur. It is also pointed out that in the
year 2021, total 245 criminal cases (against women) related to

of the victims have been submitted before the concerned court
below along with the charge sheet or not, he prays for and was
allowed time to file affidavit in this regard.

Ashok Kumar, presently posted as Superintendent of Police,
Rampur has filed his personal affidavit dated 07.07.2022
mentioning therein that “in the cases in which audio/video

to Section 161(3) Cr.P.C. as well as the provisions of sub-

different police stations of District Aligarh, only in 1959
criminal cases audio/video recording were made and in 10730
cases audio/video recording were not made. The chart further
depicts that between 25.5.2021 and 24.5.2022, total 1250

Cr.P.C. was already recorded on 28.7.2020 and her statement
under Section 164 Cr.P.C. was recorded on 17.8.2020.
19.    Apart from several reasons justifying his action, it is
further mentioned in the affidavit that since there were material
contradictions in the statements of the victim recorded under
Section 161 and 164 Cr.P.C. he got the Majeed Bayan (second

Superintendent of Police, Aligarh,       Shri Devi Gulam, the first
investigating officer, Shri Vikas Kumar, the second investigating
officer and Shri Karmveer Singh, the third investigating officer
of the case, it is crystal clear that compliance of          amended
provisions of Section 161(3) Cr.P.C. as well as Sub-Section 10 of
Section 15-A of the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes
(Prevention of Atrocities) Act has not been made in the instant

mother of the victim against the applicant Vivek Kumar under

It would be relevant to mention that 1st and 2nd proviso
to Section 161 (3) Cr.P.C had been inserted by Act 5 of
2009 (w.e.f. 31.12.2009) and Act 13 of 2013 (we.f.
2.03.2013) respectively, but this Court has been noticing
that in majority of cases, the said provisions are not
being followed by the Investigating Officers in true sense
and practice of recording second statement under section
161 Cr.P.C. of the victim/prosecutrix after recording her
statement under Section 164 Cr.P.C. is on higher side and
in some cases, conclusions are drawn by the
Investigating Officer on the basis of second statement
under section 161 Cr.P.C., ignoring the statements under
Section 164 Cr.P.C. This Court also found that it is
common argument on behalf of the prosecution in all
such cases that there is no bar for recording the second
statement under Section 161 Cr.P.C. of the
victim/prosecutrix. In the opinion of this Court, the
statement under Section 164 Cr.P.C, will prevail over the
statement under Section 161 Cr.P.C.
High Courts are sentinels of justice with extraordinary
powers to ensure that rights of citizen are duly protected.
Since Mr. Chaturvedi has fairly conceded that 1st and 2nd
proviso to Section 161 (3) Cr.P.C. has not been followed
in this case and assured this Court that higher authority
will certainly look into the matter, therefore this Court is
not taking any action leaving it upon the authorities
concerned to take appropriate action in the matter. In
view of above, personal appearance of Mr. Raj Kishore
(Investigating Officer of this case) is dispensed with.
Exemption application No. 5 of 2021 dated 09.08.2021 is
disposed of.
Let a copy of this order be sent to the Director General of
Police, U.P., Lucknow and Principal Secretary, Home,
U.P. Lucknow within two weeks, who shall issue
necessary directions/guidelines to all the Senior
Superintendent of Police regarding compliance of
statutory provisions provided in 1st and 2nd proviso to
Section 161 (3) Cr.P.C. within two months.
30.   Further, in compliance of the directions of the Coordinate
Bench of this Court in Criminal Misc. Application No. 31695 of
2021 (Dharmendra alias Patra Vs. State of U.P.), the Director
General of Police , U.P. Lucknow had already issued Circular
Letter No. 41 of 2021 dated 29.10.2021 directing all the
investigating officers that in the cases against women in which
the statement of the victim has been recorded under Section
164 Cr.P.C. and in case of there being variations in the
statements of the victim under Sections 161 and 164 Cr.P.C.,
the investigating officer shall not put any question in
supplementary statement (Majeed Bayan) of the victim, which
frustrate and negate the statement of the victim under Section
164 Cr.P.C. The Circular Letter No. 41 of 2021 reads as under :

9. In the matters in hand the prosecutrix/victim after
giving her statement under Section 161 of the Code
levelling allegations of rape against the accused, has
given up the same in her statement recorded under
Section 164 of the Code. The Investigating Officer then
records the statement of the prosecutrix/victim again
under Section 161 of the Code and puts specific
questions to her with regards to the said variations in
her statements and records her answers to the said
10. The said action of the Investigating Officer is not
appreciable. Putting questions to the prosecutrix/victim
with regards to the change in version by her in the
statements under Section 161 of the Code and in the
statement under Section 164 of the Code, clearly shows
disrespect to the courts who have recorded the
statements under Section 164 of the Code. The said
statements under Section 164 of the Code recorded by
Judicial Magistrates is in discharge of their judicial
functions and the act of recording of the said statements
was a judicial act which was performed by a public
servant while discharging his judicial functions. The
said document is relevant under Section 35 of Indian
Evidence Act and also under Section 72 of Indian
Evidence Act and, as such, assumes the character of
being a public document.
11. The statement made by the prosecutrix/victim under
section 164 of the Code before the Magistrate stands on
a high pedestal and sanctity during the course of
investigation than that of her statement recorded under
section 161 of the Code by the Investigating Officer.
12. Though the Investigating Agency has unfettered
powers to investigate a matter, but they cannot on their
whims and fancy adopt a procedure which would
clearly be challenging the sanctity of an act done by a
court of law while discharge of a judicial function. By
putting questions to the prosecutrix/victim in her
second statement under Section 161 of the Code after
recording of the statement under Section 164 of the
Code relating to the different versions in the said two
statements, the Investigating Officer cannot frustrate
the same and also make an attempt to make the purpose
of the said exercise look a farce.
13. The act of putting specific questions pertaining to
the variations in the said two statements by the
Investigating Officer is viewed with an impression of
clearly challenging the authority of a judicial act. The
Investigating Officers have clearly exceeded their
jurisdiction by proceedings to investigate in such a
manner. The same appears to be with a sole purpose to
frustrate the statements recorded by a Magistrate.
14. Even the Uttar Pradesh Police Regulations while
dealing with the particular duties of Police Officers for
"Investigations" in its Chapter XI do not in any manner
authorize Investigating Officers to act as such.
Although Paragraph-107 of the same states that the
Investigating Officer would not act as a mere clerk
while recordings of statements but has to observe and
infer. Paragraph-109 empowers for recording of
supplementary statements. But the manner in which
supplementary statements in the present matters have
been recorded clearly show that they are for the sole
purpose to put the variations to the witnesses and
record the same.
15. This court thus finds that the manner in which the
supplementary statements are recorded and the purpose
for recording of the same is only and solely for
frustrating the purpose of statements recorded under
Section 164 of the Code and to negate and defeat the
earlier statement of the prosecutrix/victim given under
section 164 of the Code whether it is in favour or
against the accused otherwise the sanctity of the
statement under section 164 of the Code will loose its
value. The same is neither the intent of Investigation
nor is the purpose of it.
16. The Director General of Police, Uttar Pradesh
Lucknow is directed to look into the said new trend of
Investigation as adopted and issue suitable guidelines
for such matter so that the sanctity and authority of
judicial proceedings are maintained and they should not
be frustrated by any act done during Investigation.
17. The Registrar (Compliance) of this Court and the
learned counsels for the State are directed to
communicate this order to the Director General of
Police, Uttar Pradesh Lucknow for its compliance and
necessary action within a period of one month from
today and submit a compliance report within one week

31.    Earlier, the Director General of Police, Uttar Pradesh had
also issued Circular letter dated 18/20.5.2022 directing therein
that in spite of the directions of the Director General of Police, it
has come to his notice that the directions given by the High
Court are not being complied with. The Circular reads as under:
It is pointed out that earlier this Court vide order dated 11.8.2021
passed in Criminal Misc. Bail Application No. 22430 of 2021 (Bulle Vs.
State of U.P.) has directed the state Government to ensure fair
investigation in all the matters and issue appropriate directions to all the
investigating officers regarding mode and manner of recording the
statement under Section 161 Cr.P.C.
It has been informed that pursuant to the said order, the State
Government has issued Circular letter No. 820........... directing all the
Police Commissioner/Senior Superintendent of Police/Superintendent of
Police of Uttar Pradesh to bring the guidelines mentioned in the Circular
in the notice of their subordinates and to ensure strict compliance of the
Circular letter, which was issued in compliance of the order of this Court
dated 11.8.2021 passed in Criminal Misc. Bail Application No. 22430 of
2021 (Bulle Vs. State of U.P.).
It is very disturbing to note that the investigating officer of this
case namely SI Ashish Kumar Singh of police station Nawabganj, district
Prayagraj has recorded the second statement under Section 161 Cr.P.C.
(Majeed Bayan) of the victim on 26.7.2021 after the statement of the
victim under Section 164 Cr.P.C. was recorded on 25.6.2021, which is in
the teeth of the Circular letter dated 01.9.2021 issued by the State
Government as well as in violation of the provisions of Section 161
32.   It is submitted that pursuant to the order of this Court
dated 11.8.2021 passed in Criminal Misc. Bail Application No.
22430 of 2021 (Bulle Vs. State of U.P.), the Additional Chief
Secretary (Home), Government of U.P., Lucknow U.P. had again
issued a Government Order dated 10.6.2022 to the Director
General of Police and Additional Director General of Police,
Crime, U.P. and all the Police Commissioners/SSPs/SPs in Uttar
Pradesh directing them to comply with the amended provisions
of Section 161 of Code of Criminal Procedure. The Government
Order dated 10.6.2022 reads thus:
Affidavits/suggestions/undertakings of the State
33.   An affidavit of Shri Awanish Kumar Awasthi, Additional
Chief Secretary (Home), Government of Uttar Pradesh Lucknow
dated 29.8.2022 has also been filed, which is taken on record.
34.   In paragraph No. 4 of the affidavit, it is mentioned that a
meeting was convened on 26.8.2022 under the Chairmanship
of Additional Chief Secretary (Home), Government of Uttar
Pradesh, Lucknow, which was attended by Mr. B.D. Paulson,
Secretary, Home Department, Government of U.P. Lucknow, Mr.
Tarun Gauba, Secretary Home Department, Government of
General of Police (Crime), U.P. Lucknow, Mr. Prem Prakash,
Additional Director General of Police, Prayagraj Zone, Prayagraj
(through        video     conferencing),         Mr.  Amit     Pathak,     Deputy
Inspector        General         of    Police      (Public   Grievance)        DGP
Advocate, High Court, Allahabad (through video conferencing),
Allahabad (through video conferencing) and Mr. Ashish Singh,
Senior Prosecuting Officer and after due deliberation, following
decisions were taken:
(i)   Postmortem and injury reports must be typed out
and made easily legible and practice of handwritten
reports be discontinued.
(ii)  During the postmortem examination, there should
be DNA and fingerprint sampling and necessary software
must be developed for this purpose.
(iii) In cases of gunshot injuries, instead of full body x-
ray, the x-ray should be of the area where the wound is
located. However, in such cases where the wound of
entry or exit is not apparent, the need of taking x-ray be
made mandatory.
(iv)    During postmortem examination, the injuries on
the dead body should be photographed in colour to
highlight the same.
(v)    An index be prepared to be appended with each
case     diary,   which    is   submitted    before     the
Prosecutor/Hon'ble Judges. It should be explored if
necessary facility can be provided through CCTNS
(vi)   A synopsis be prepared of the contents of the
report containing the opinion of the investigating officer
as encapsulated in the report under Section 173(2) Cr.P.c.
An index should also be prepared for convenient perusal
and reference. This synopsis be a part of the report under
(vii)   The importance of the role of the supervisory
officer be emphasized and that the said officer should not
function only as a post office. Every investigation must be
scrutinized in a microscopic manner and any lacuna or
lapse must be pointed out to the investigating officer.
Provisions    should   also  be   made    for  training the
investigating officer on a regular basis.
(viii) Senior Supervisory Officers must submit the report
submitted by the police under Section 173(2) Cr.P.C
expeditiously and not hold it back in their custody
needlessly. In this context, a letter dated 05.05.2016 had
already been issued by the Director General of Police, U.P.
(ix)    Before ordering further investigation under Section
173(8), it is desirable to seek permission/give information
to the concerned learned court, but the necessity of this
step be examined in the light of the relevant and
applicable statutory provisions and the judgements and
observations passed by Hon'ble Apex Court and Hon'ble
High Court. In all cases where the statements of
witnesses are recorded using audio/video mode, the
relevant material be made part of the case diary by
means of compact disc/pen drive.
(x)    The font size used for preparing the case diary be
increased to a size, which would facilitate easy and legible
perusal of the same. For this purpose, the cooperation of
NIC be sought to implement the increase in font-size in
the records, uploaded on the CCTNS.
(xi)   The strict adherence be ensured to the statutory
provisions encapsulated in Section 65B IPC and that
investigating officer be trained to adopt a sensitive
approach in these matters.
(xii)   It was emphasized that proper directions be
imparted to supervisory officers to ensure that they
perform their duty efficiently and diligently. It was
informed by the Additional Director General of Police
(crime) that in all districts (pan state) training was being
imparted in orderly room and by crime meetings. The
Additional Chief Secretary (Home), Government of U.P.,
Lucknow issued directions that action be initiated against
those investigating officer who displayed negligence in
discharging their duties and thereby impair fair and
proper investigation.
(xiii)       In every district, the Joint Director (Prosecution)
should head a legal cell, which should be established with
the aim to educate all investigating officers with the latest
amendments in criminal law and the judgements passed
by the Hon'ble Apex Court and Hon'ble High Court.
(xiv)        Lastly,    it    was      decided         that the  necessary
government order/circular/road-map, which was to be
issued covered a vast range and the support and
cooperation of technical and other departments was
required.
35.       The Minutes of the meeting dated 26.8.2022, which was
held under the chairmanship of Additional Chief Secretary
(Home), Government of U.P., Lucknow is reproduced herein
under for ready reference:
सचाक्ष्यों की सचुरक्षा व अिभरक्षा की श्रृंखिला (Chain of Custody) भी सचुिनितिश्चित की
36.    On the strength of the said decision, which was taken in
the meeting dated 26.8.2022, it is submitted by Shri M.C.
Chaturvedi, learned Additional Advocate General and Shri Shiv
Pal Singh, learned Government Advocate that the aforesaid
decision taken by the State Government shall be effectively
implemented as expeditiously as possible not later than two
37.    Shri Prem Prakash, Additional Director General of Police,
Prayagraj Zone, Prayagraj on behalf of the Director General of
Police, U.P. Lucknow assures the Court that apart from the
aforesaid steps/suggestions, he will also take other steps to be
needed for fair investigation.
38.    This   Court  is  of   the  view   that  criminal  justice
administration system in India places human rights and dignity
of human at a much higher pedestal. In our jurisprudence an
accused is presumed to be innocent till proved guilty. The
accused is entitled to fair and impartial investigation and fair
trial and prosecution is expected to play a balanced role in the
39.    Fair and unbiased investigation are the fundamental
canons of our criminal jurisprudence and are quite in
conformity with the constitutional mandate enshrined in Articles
20 and 21 of the Constitution of India. Every investigation has
to be conducted in a fair manner and in accordance with law.
Fair and proper investigation is the primary duty of the
investigating officer. In every civilized society, the police is
invested with powers of investigation of a crime to secure
punishment for the criminals and it is in the interest of the
society that the investigating agency must act honestly and
fairly and did not resort to fabricating false evidence or creating
false clues because such acts shake the confidence of the
common people not only in the investigating agency, but in the
ultimate analysis in the system of dispensation of criminal
40.    On the strength of affidavit dated 10.7.2022 filed by Shri
Awanish     Kumar     Awasthi,    as    mentioned    in   preceding
paragraphs, he assured the Court that amended provisions of
Section 161 Cr.P.C. and Sub-Section 10 of Section 15A of the
Scheduled     Castes   and    Scheduled    Tribes   (Prevention  of
Atrocities) Act shall be complied with and implemented in letter
and spirit.
41.    Considering the steps taken by the State Government for
strict implementation of the amended provisions of Section 161
Cr.P.C. and Sub Section 10 of Section 15A of the SC/ST Act and
the undertakings given by the State Government by means of
affidavit dated 10.07.2022 and 29.8.2022 both filed by Shri
Lucknow      for  implementation       of   various   reform    and
improvement in investigation system as mentioned in the
preceding paragraphs as well as assurance given to the Court
that whatever other necessary steps will be needed to improve
the investigation system shall also be taken from time to time
by the State Government, this Court does not find any reason
to doubt on the aforesaid undertakings          given by the State
Government and feels that at this stage no further direction is
required. I hope and trust that the State Government shall
make all efforts to ensure the compliance of undertakings given
by the State Government in the affidavit dated 10.7.2022 and
29.8.2022 for improving the investigation system.
42.    Before parting with the case, this Court records its
appreciation to Shri Prem Prakash, Additional Director General
of Police, Prayagraj Zone, Prayagraj, who attended the Court
proceeding on behalf of the Director General of Police, U.P.
Government and Shri Radhey Mohan Srivastava, Additional LR,
who attended the Court proceeding on behalf of LR, U.P.
Government for their valuable assistance and making sincere
and tireless efforts to streamline the investigation system.
43.    Registrar (Compliance) is directed to send a copy of this
order immediately to the Additional Chief Secretary (Home),
UP., Lucknow and the Director General of Police, UP, Lucknow.
44.    The Additional Chief Secretary (Home), U.P. Lucknow is
directed to send a copy of this order to the Director General
(Health), who in turn shall circulate the same to all the CMOs of
the district as well as to the authorities, who are concerned for
execution of the decision taken in the meeting dated 26.8.2022
for compliance.
45.    The Director General of Police is directed to circulate a
copy of this order to all the Senior Superintendent of
Police/Superintendent of Police of the districts for compliance.
46.    Since, the aforesaid cases have been connected and
heard together only for limited purpose and common order is
passed, they are disconnected and be listed separately on
07.9.20222 before the appropriate Bench for consideration of
prayer for bail.
47.    Put up this matter on 07.9.2022 before the appropriate
Bench for hearing the matter on merits as fresh.
