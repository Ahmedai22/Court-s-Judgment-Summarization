7.     The investigation into the crime was conducted by the team headed by PW72
(Pradeep Singh, Asstt. Commissioner of Police) and the salient features of the matter
including the steps undertaken during investigation can be tabulated as follows:
1         28.12.2005        An incident of shoot-out occurred at the JN Tata Auditorium of Indian

and 38 material objects in support of its case. Exhibits D1 to D7 were also marked at the
instance of the Accused in the cross examination of the Prosecution witnesses. The

(2)    Connectivity of those articles to the conspiracy between the accused persons;
(3)    The conduct of the accused persons with reference to such conspiracy to constitute the

11. The Prosecution examined PWs 1 to 8 and 13, who according to the Prosecution,
were sought to be drawn and indoctrinated into the design and scheme of the Accused.
All these witnesses did not support the Prosecution and were declared hostile. However,
Paragraph 44 of the judgment under appeal
according to the Prosecution, their testimonies could still be relied upon to establish the
fact that all the Accused were working together with a sense of purpose and had been in
touch with the witnesses. By way of example, the following portions from the depositions
“I am acquainted with, Accused-2, Afzal Pasha and Accused-6 Nazamuddin. Both of them are
present in this court on this day. Witness identified the Accused-2 and 6 who are sitting at the 4th
and 6th position respectively.
One day when I was there in my shop along with Parveed, 4 years ago, Accused-2 and 6 came to
my shop and said that they have come from Kolar, presuming that they might be friends of my friend
Mukthiyar who lives Kolar, I called Mukthiyar over phone. The said Mukthiyar is originally from Kolar
and was residing in Bangalore. I had called his Bangalore number. Mukthiyar came to my shop.
Accused-2 and 6 told us about Islam religion, told us to do Namaz and told us to help the poor
people. Told us to establish one Madarasa. We offered both of them cup of tea and sent them off.
After six-seven days, both of them came to my shop once again. Me, Parveez, Mukthiyar and
Zaheed were there in the shop. They told us, we will not talk in shop, lets go to park and talk. All
four of us went to park along with them. Both of them told about Quran and said that, we have to
establish an organisation of people, and told us that it is not possible for the people to go to the
mosques or Dargah and pray, hence they are to be demolished. For this work, 15-20 persons are
to be organised and the expenses for the same shall be borne by the same organisation. As the
matters that they were saying were not appropriate, I told them that I am getting a phone call and I
returned to the shop. Behind me, my friends also came back. Accused-2 and 6 went back from the
park only. All four of us had talk amongst ourselves, and we decided that the conduct of Accused-2
and 6 are not good, if they come back again, we will not entertain them. After few days, Javid had
received a call from the said persons, Javid informed that he has told them not to come and we will
not be available.
After the witness was declared hostile, he was cross examined by the Special
Public Prosecutor, when the witness stated:-
It is correct if stated that, in my statement I had stated that the accused persons had informed me
that Madarasas are to be opened, Muslims are to be trained, for that finance needs to be arranged.
It is not correct if stated that, I had stated that Jihad to be declared against the killings of Muslims
by Hindus in Gujarat. The said statement was flagged as EP-1. It is correct if stated that, they had
told me that, people are to be stopped from going to Dargahs and we should make Dargahs non-
existent. It is not correct if stated that, by making Dargahs impure, communal harmony to be
disturbed and law and order situation should be created and government should be weakened, they
had informed. The said statement was flagged as EP-2. It is not correct if stated that, the accused
Afzal Pasha was trained in Dhaka regarding Jihad and acquainted with the Chief of Lashkar-e-Toiba
of Saudi Arabia, Abu Hamja, Wali Ur Rahman and Abdul Rahman of Nelagonda, that he needs to
establish Lashkar-e-Toiba in Karnataka secretly, and had stated that, you all have to co-operate.
The said statement was flagged as EP-3.
Accordingly, it is not correct if stated that, I had stated while we were sitting in the park, the said
accused said that, we will all together, we will organise LeT in Bangalore, Hindus are killing Muslims
in Kashmir and at all parts of India, we will declare Jihad as said in Quran, we will destroy India
through revolution, we will collect money for LeT, we will bring the interested persons for training,
all the expenses will be borne by Abdul Rahman, I will also train the joining persons temporarily.
The said portion of the statement was flagged as EP-4.”
Accused-6, Munna was introduced to me by Chintamani watch shop, Abdul Rahman. The said
Munna is present in the court today and he was identified. I used to go to tea stall to read news
paper. Then, I got acquainted with the Accused-4, Noorulla. He is also sitting in the Court today.
When I went to Mulabagilu for Islam religious canvassing, I got acquainted with Accused – 5, Irfan.
He is sitting in the court today and the witness have identified him. I know the Accused-2, he is also
present in the court today.
… …In Chintamani there are two Masjids, in those Masjids when we went for Namaz, the
management there threw us out saying that, there is a different custom in those Masjids. Therefore,
we took a room and we used to Namaz there only. We made a trust and had purchased land for the
trust. Abdul Rehman was the Chairman for that trust, 2nd Accused Afzal Pasha was the
ViceChairman, Accused-6 Munna was the Secretary for that trust, Accused-4 Noorulla was the Joint
Secretary, I was treasurer for the trust. Accused Abdul Pasha had a fracture of bone of hand, then
Accused-1 Razu Rahman came to see him, then Abdul Pasha introduced him to me that he was his
friend in Saudi.
Abdul Rehman had organised a tea party in our house, one day. On that day, Accused-1 Rahman
told us that we all should be united and should be co-operative with our neighbours. … …
….. Evening at 7 pm he left after the Namaz. After that, I had dropped Abdul Rahman to the
Bangarpet Railway Station on my Bike.”
After the witness was declared hostile, in response to the questions put by the
Special Public Prosecutor, the witness stated:-
“It is not correct if stated that, in the statement that I had given to the police, I had stated that, the
Accused Afzal Pasha is the major man in Lashkar-e-Toiba, he speaks about Jihad, he had informed
me that we will conduct a meeting at 5 PM in our house and as per his request when we gathered
in my home, after introducing that Afzal Pasha is the commander of Lashkar-e-Toiba of South India,
after that Abdul Rahman spoke and said that, the country of India should be made into pieces, we
will conduct a training about Jihad, I will supply the gun, bomb and other required items, you all
organise yourselves declare Jihad and said that demolish Dargahs create communal clashes and
create instability of government. Listening to all this matter, we said it is not possible to do all that
here, we did not cooperate. Me, Jameer and Ameer came back from the meeting without signing,
and I had stated that, we were present at the meeting, Munna, Noorulla Khan and Abdul Pasha
signed. The said statement was flagged as EP-11.”
The witness was recalled and cross examined further by the Special Public
Prosecutor when the witness stated:-
“The trust that we have registered is Masjid O Mohammed Ya Ahle Adees Trust. It is correct that
the PW-5 Jameer, PW-6 Ameer and CW-11 Miyammed were also the members of the trust. When
the assused-1 came to my house, Afzal Pasha, Noorulla Khan, Munna, Jameer and Ameer had
come there. I did not question that, why he is saying like that, when the Accused-1 told us that we
all should be united. Afzal Pasha is my childhood friend.
I do not know about, the accused-1 is the South India Commander of Lashkar-e-Toiba and has
come to preach us. On that day, the accused-1 was there at my home for about one and half hour,
he had only told that we all should be united. It is false if stated that, Abdul Rahman in his speech
told that, in India atrocity is happening on Muslims, we all should declare Jihad unitedly, I will provide
necessary training and required weapons and all. It is not correct if stated that, Abdul Rahman had
said like this, we did not agree to this. Abdul Rahman was staying in Woodland Hotel. Afzal Pasha
is my relative.”
12. The Trust referred to in the deposition of PW4 was constituted pursuant to
execution of Trust Deed (Ex-P27) on 10.12.2003, in terms of which the Trustees were:-
“(i)    Abdul Rehaman s/o Watch Maker Mohan Road;
Thus, Accused Nos. 2, 4 and 6 as well as PWs 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8 were Trustees of
13. It is accepted that Ex. P-92 is the Minute Book of said Ex. P-27 Trust. Apart from
the recovered arms and ammunition and explosive materials, minutes of meetings as
recorded in Ex.P.92 recovered from A-2 are of some significance. The contents of Ex.
P.92 show that the meetings were attended by some of the accused who signed the
minutes. The details in that behalf were captured in Paragraph 70 of the judgment of the
Trial Court, which Paragraph, for facility is extracted hereunder: -
“70. I have perused Ex.P92 and the relevant page of the first meeting is marked as Ex.P92 (c) and
(d). The said meeting was held on 10.12.2003 in the house of Fairoz at Chintamani, which was
attended by Accused Nos.1, 2, 4 and 6 along with some other members. As per its recitals, it goes
to show that the Jihad meeting was held at 5:00 P.M. and in the said meeting Accused No.1 was
introduced to all others. Further, it goes to show that Accused No.1 addressed the meeting saying
that in India muslims are treated badly, Babri Masjid is demolished, muslims were killed in Gujarat
and we all should be prepared to fight against it. Further, it goes to show that Accused No.1 assured
that he will supply guns, bombs and also financial assistance, etc., for preparation of Jihad training.
Further, it goes to show that the members who attended the meeting, namely Fairoz, Zameer and
Ameer, dissented with the Accused No.1 because if they do so, it will cause harm to the muslims
and by saying so they walked out from the meeting. The said meeting also discloses that other
members agreed with the Accused No.1 and meeting was concluded at 8:00 P.M. Ex.P92(d) goes
to show that Accused Nos.1, 2, 4 and 6 have signed the minutes book. At Ex.P92 (d) after the
signatures of Accused No.2, there is a gap and it appears that something has been erased. The
learned Special Public Prosecutor has argued that one member who attended the meeting might
signed after Accused No.2, but as he came to know about the consequences, he might have erased
his signature. He further argued that the persons who attended the meeting being descended with
the decision of the accused the I.O. has cited them as witnesses. I find considerable force in his
arguments as because Ex.P92 (c) and (d) goes to show that the witnesses, namely Fairoz, Zameer
and Ameer, dissented with the views of Accused No.1. Ex.P92 ( f) goes to show that second meeting
was held in the house of Accused No.6 from 19.08.2006 and it was attended by Accused Nos.2, 4,
5 and 6 . Ex.P92 (f) goes to show that in the said meeting a society was formed in the name of
Jamath-ul-Mujahiddin and it was agreed in the meeting to cooperate the Jidhad training. Ex.P92(a)
and (h) goes to show that third meeting was held on 18.12.2005 in the house of Accused No.2 at
Lakkasandra, Bangalore, and Accused Nos.2, 4, and 6 attended the same. Ex.P92(g) and (h) also
goes to show that Accused No.5 addressed the meeting by saying that Islam was sent in the hands
of Paigambar to be superior to the other religion and Jihad has to be declared if anybody causes
damage to Islam. Ex.P92 (g) and (h) also goes to show that Accused No.4 has addressed the
meeting by saying the Jihad has to be started by offering lunch (Davath) and if anybody opposed
Jihad has to be declared at any time. Ex.P92 (g) and (h) also goes to show that the Accused No.2
has addressed the meeting saying that Jihad has to be declared in the name of God, in case killed
he will be ‘Shahid’ and in case of survival he would become ‘Bahaddur’. Further, it goes to show
that Accused No.2 addressed to the effect that Kuwath means ‘power’ and by referring the
handwritings of the book given by Tariq Sahni of Bangladesh he told that the power is in bombs,
bandook and AK-47. Ex.P92 (g) and (h) also goes to show that Accused No.2 instructed to the
Accused No.4 and Accused No.6 to identify the Dargah and other important places, for that they
agreed. Ex.P92 (g) and (h) also goes to show that next meeting was fixed on 31.12.2005 and the
third meeting was concluded at 8:00 P.M. The advocate for the accused argued that there are
overwriting at Ex.P92. It is true that at some places we can see the overwriting. At Ex.P92 (c) at the
top in date there is overwriting of day, but not about the month and year. Similarly, at Ex.P92 (g)
also there is a overwriting of date. But, at the end of third meeting date of next meeting has been
specifically mentioned without there being any overwriting. Similarly, in the recitals also some words
are striked out, but it will take away the meaning of the sentence. Therefore, I am of the opinion that
the overwritings are natural.”
14. PW25 – Anil Kumar Dubey, an independent panch witness, stated inter alia about
the recovery of Diary Exh.P-92. He deposed that on 22.01.2006 he had accompanied
the police and A-2; that when they reached the house of A-2 the door was opened by his
wife; that A-2 took the police to a room and opened a suitcase which was lying below the
cot in the bedroom using the key that was with him, whereafter, articles Exh.P-81, P-92,
six video cassettes (M-15) and other articles Exh.P-93 to P-104 were seized vide
Panchnama Exh.P-105. The witness stated that after the seizure was done in his
presence, Panchnama, Exh.P-105 was drawn and signed by him. He also stated that the
police had called a Moulvi from a Masjid in the neighbourhood, who read the names and
some of the contents of the written material and books. The cross-examination of the
witness did not draw anything substantial to dispel the credibility of the assertions made
in the examination-in-chief.
PW29 Shahnawaz Ahmed deposed that he was called by the police to translate
the Urdu books and other material but denied that Panchnama was drawn in his
presence. According to the witness, his signatures at four places on Panchnama Exh.P-
105 were taken later and the contents of said Panchnama Exh. P-105 were not read out
to him. The witness was declared hostile and was cross examined by the prosecution in
which he accepted that he had never signed any document without knowing the contents
15. Exh. P-92, among other documents, was made over to PW-67, Syed Asgar Imam,
Hand Writing Expert, along with sample signatures of the Accused. According to this
witness, signatures on the sheets of Exh. P-92 were marked as Q39 to Q44 and when
said Expert compared the sample signatures of the Accused with Q39 to Q44, the result
(a)Q39 and Q40 matched with the sample signature of A-2.
The relevant portion from the testimony of PW-67, Syed Asgar Imam was as under:-

Ex.P.235 and my signatures are marked as Ex.P.235(a) to (c). The said certificate is counter signed
by the Assistant Director, FSL and forwarded to the I.O. by the director.”
Nothing substantial came out in the cross-examination conducted on behalf of the
Accused with respect to Exh. P-92. The signatures of A-1, A-2, A-4, A-5 and A-6 on some
of the minutes, according to the Prosecution, were thus proved beyond any doubt.
16. The recovery of books and literature recovered from the Accused, which according
to the Prosecution was inflammatory material, may now be dealt with:-
(A) On 22.01.2016, A-2 took PW72 to his house leading to the recovery of certain
literature and books which according to the Prosecution were inflammatory. The literature
comprised of a book named as ‘Taqbeer’ (Exh.P-81), a book called ‘Jihad’ containing 66
pages (Exh.P-82), literature under caption ‘Jamaat-e-Mujahiddin’ (Exh.P83), a book
named ‘Hazarath Mohammed Kajikar’ (Exh.P-84), a book by name ‘Warning’ (Exh.P85),
a book named ‘Albalaaq’ (Exh.P-87 and Exh.P-88), a book named ‘Yehoodiyonki
Tarahim’ (Exh.P-90) and collection of 40 Pamphlets (Exh.P-91), apart from the aforesaid
(B) Pursuant to the voluntary statement made by A-3, four books namely; Jadul
Mujahiddin, Albalaq, Taqbeer and Biddat, Exhs.P-64 to P-67 respectively were
recovered as per Panchnama Exh. P-68.
(C) The voluntary statement of A-5 led to the recovery of books named Dastani
Mujahid and Jihad (Exhibits P-76 and P-77) and some letterheads.
17. The Prosecution also relied upon the confessional statements of Accused Nos. 4,
6 and 7 which were recorded by the 9th Additional Chief Metropolitan Magistrate,
Bangalore City and marked as Exhibits P-268, P-269 and P-270 respectively.
18. After considering the material on record, the Trial Court in its judgment dated
17.12.2011, took the view that the sanction accorded by the Under Secretary in respect
of the offences punishable under the provisions of Sections 10 and 13 of the 1967 Act
was defective.
19. The documents, books and literature referred to above were dealt with by the Trial
Court in Paragraphs 53-56 of its judgment as under: -
“53. At the earlier stage I have made a note that all the Urdu Books seized by the I.O. from each
accused will be considered together. I have observed about the seizure of the books and other
documents from Accused No.2 by the I.O. under Ex.P105. The books and documents seized from
Accused No.2 are marked as Ex.P81 to 90. The Book namely Taqbir is marked as Ex.P81. The
book ‘Jihad’ is marked as Ex.P82. The Book ‘Jamal-e Mujahiddin’ is marked as Ex.P83. The Book
‘Hazarath Mohammed Zakikar’ is marked as Ex.P84. The Book ‘Warning’ is marked as Ex.P86. The
weekly magazine ‘Albalaaq’ is marked as Ex.P87 to 88.
One book is written by Raithullah Faruqui is marked as Ex.P89 and 40 pamphlets are marked as
Ex.P90. PW-72 in his evidence has stated that, he has secured the neighbouring witness
Shahnawaz Ahmed, who knows Urdu as pancha to know the contents of the said book. The said
witness is examined as PW-29. This witness turned hostile and not supported the prosecution case.
To some extent he has stated that one Mohammed Anwar and Lakkasandra, landlord, called him to
translate the Urdu Books. Further, PW-29 has stated that he went to the house and the police were
present in the house of Anwar. He has also stated that the police told him to translate Urdu Book
and he translated the books given to him. Though this witness has turned hostile about conducting
of the panchanam i.e. Ex.P105, to some extent we can gather that he has translated Urdu Books to
the police. PW-72 has stated that on the books i.e. Ex.P81(Taqbir) there is a symbol of crossed Rifle
and Sword. PW-72 has stated that the witness, namely Shahnawaz Ahmed has verified the book
and told that in the 9 Chapter there is a phrase as “Bharath mit janewala hai”, in the 10 Chapter as
“Haath me gun utao”, and in the 14th Chapter “Lashkar -e-Taiba”, PW72 has stated that, the relevant
chapters were marked in red ink and PW-29 has explained the meaning of the relevant chapters.
PW-72 has further stated that said Shahnawaz told that those articles are anti-national and
provocative. PW-72 has also stated that the said witness Shahnawaz explained the meaning of the
other books also. PW-72 also further stated that the witness Shahnawaaz told that in the book
‘Warning’ it is written about the demolition of Babri Masjid and also about the wrong Act by the order
communities on Dargas.
54.    As I discussed at earlier stage about the seizure of books Ex.P64 to 67 from Accused No.3
Ex.P64 is ‘Jadul Majahiddin’, Ex.P65 is ‘Albalaaq’, Ex.P66 is ‘Taqbir’ and Ex.P67 is ‘Biddath’. PW-
50 is the Police Official, who seized the Ex.P64 from Accused No.3. PW-50 in his evidence has
stated that, the contents of the said books were explained by Rukman Ahmed, who knows Urdu.
The said witness examined as PW-27. He turned hostile and not supported the prosecution case.
But, this witness by seeing Ex.P66 i.e. ‘Taqbir’ explained the ‘Taqbir’ means ‘Voice of Allah’. This
witness has also stated that in one Part at page No.166 it is mentioned that ‘India will destroy’ and
also it is written that, ‘to hold the gun’ and the said book is printed at Pakistan. He has also stated
that, at Page No.64 there is a recital about glorifying of injured persons in Jihad. PW-50 also in his
evidence stated that, PW-27 has examined the book ‘Taqbir’ and informed that in the 9th Chapter it
is written as ‘Bharath mit janewala hai’ and in the said book at 10 chapter it is written as ‘Haath me
Gun utao’. PW-50 further stated that, the witness i.e. PW-27 has examined the contents of the books
seized by him. The advocate for Accused No.2 and 3 vehemently argued that it is practically
impossible to know the contents of all the books within a short period and to translate it. They have
also argued that by picking up some sentences, the meaning of the book cannot be gathered and
only after reading the entire book only the real meaning of the book can be extracted. On perusal of
the evidence of PW-50 and PW-72 it appears that some important chapters were only got explained
by them. It is an admitted fact that the true translation of entire book are not furnished. The I.O. has
referred all the books to the Chairman, Urdu Academy, for its translation. The then Chairman of
Urdu Academy, namely M. Nooruddin is examined as PW-65. He has stated that during the year
2006 he was working as Chairman at Urdu Academy and also he has stated that he has obtained
M.A., Ph.D., in Urdu language. He has also stated that in the month of July or August 2006 A.C.P.,
Yashwanthpura Sub-Division, has sent some Arabic and Urdu Books for their translation to English.
He has also stated that about 15 books were handed over to him, namely Sunflower notebook,
‘Kya Aurath Masjid ya Edga nahi ja sakthi’, two weekly magazines of ‘Albalaaq ke Jerayum’, 40
Pamphlets of ‘Jadul Mujahiddin’ and ‘Vedon ki duniyan me’. PW-65 has further stated that because
of shortage of time he took the assistance of his colleague. During the cross-examination he has
admitted that all the 15 books were read by his friend. He has also admitted that, his friend has
underlined some portion which were only read by him. As argued by the advocate for the accused
without reading the entire text, the real meaning cannot be extracted. It is true that PW-62 has stated
that, he has read the portion which were underlined by his colleague. Here I am to observe that as
Stated by PW-65 in the Chief Examination itself stated that because of shortage of time he took the
assistance of colleague, who well-versed in Urdu and Arabian language. The person who assisted
him is none other than the colleagues of PW-65. PW-65 has stated that he has given the gist of all
books given to him in his report as per Ex.P225. He has stated that the gist of Ex.P76 is that
“democracy is not suitable to establish Islam religion and it is inevitable to kill to secure power”. He
has also stated that, in Page No.16 of Ex.P76 it is written that the muslim community is suppressed
by majority communities and the aim is not to awoke muslim community and the muslim should not
prepare with arms’, As such, the meaning is majority communities attacking on the muslims. Further
PW-65 has stated that in the said book it is also written that ‘as muslims are minority community, in
a democratic system they cannot secure power’. He has also stated that in the book ‘Taqbir’ i.e.
Ex.P81, it is written that ‘India will destroy’ and also written that ‘to take gun in the hands’. It is also
written that ‘Lashkar-eToiba’ destroy the kaphirs and Lashkar-e-Toiba is fighting for good things.
Further, PW-65 has stated that he has given the gist of Ex.P64 i.e. Jadul Mujahid book and its gist
is that ‘Prophet has told to attack on India’. PW65 has stated that, in fact the prophet has not told
so, PW-65 has specifically stated that this book is provocative and most dangerous. He has also
stated that, the book Ex.P89 ‘Mujahid-ke-Azad’ is also provocative and anti-India. Relating to Ex.P81
the Special Public Prosecutor has argued that, Kaphirs are those ‘who deviate from the Islam path’.
As Per Ex.P81 it is a war against non-muslims. Much has been argued on both sides about the
meaning of Jihad. He has referred the book Islam, sex and violence, written by Anwar Sheikh. In
the 7th Chapter, the Author has examined Jihad as
“Jihad is an Arabic word, which literally means ‘endeavour’ but as an Islamic doctrine, it implies
fighting in the way of Allah (the Arabic God) to establish his supremacy over unbelievers until they
relinquish their faith to become muslims or acknowledge their subordination by paying a humiliation-
tax called ‘JAZYIA’.”
55.     The advocate for the Accused No.3 referred website copy Wikipedia, wherein Jihad is
“According to the authoritative Dictionary of Islam jihad is defined as: “A religious war with those
who are unbelievers in the mission of Muhammad enjoined especially for the purpose of advancing
Islam and repelling evil from Muslims.” “
56.     By referring terrorist organizations, the Special Public Prosecutor argued that, in the name of
Jihad these organizations are engaged in destructive activities. As an example he has referred
terrorist attacks on World Trade Organisation, attack on Parliament of India and on Hotel Taj of
Bombay. In this case we are not concerned about the other incidents and we have to see the
materials placed in the present case. If we fall back to the evidence PW-65 we can see that he has
categorically stated that some of books which were seized in this case are provocative, dangerous
and also anti-India. PW-65 is a responsible person. Therefore, though he has not furnished the
entire translation the gist of the book which he has furnished has to be accepted.”
20. Considering the recovered articles and their connection sought to be established
through the other material on record and the inference that could be drawn from such
aspects, the Trial Court concluded:-
“In the foregoing paras I have also discussed about the seizure of provocative articles from Accused
Nos.2 and 3 which are dangerous and anti - national. I have also discussed in the foregoing paras
about the seizure of explosive substance, arms and ammunitions by the Investigating Officer from
Accused Nos.2, 3, 4 and 6 at different places. It is true that when the Accused No.3 was arrested,
the Investigating Officer has seized some explosive substance. But, with respect to Accused Nos.2,
4 and 6 based on their voluntary statement explosive substance, and arms and ammunitions were
seized. As held in the decision reported in 2007 Crl. L.J. 1386 which I have mentioned above, in the
present case also presumption under Section 111A of Indian Evidence Act cannot be drawn. But,
in the said case – law it is also held that it is incumbent on the prosecution to prove that the collection
of men, arms and ammunitions was for no other purpose, but to prepare to wage war against the
Government of India to establish the offence under Section 122 of Indian Penal Code and it is
necessary for the prosecution to establish that the fire power or the potential devastation which
could be caused by the arms and ammunitions recovered from the accused was such that it would
point to the design to prepare to wage a war against Government of India. As I mentioned above
the I.O. has seized explosive substance from Accused No.6. Ballistic expert opinion and F.S.L
Report of explosive substance are in favour of the prosecution. It is true that the documents seized
from Accused No.1,5 and 7 does not amount to incriminating. I have also observed that confession
statement of the accused does not help the prosecution case. But, as I discussed above Ex.P92
clearly goes to show their active involvement in Jihad activities. Merely because there is a reference
of word ‘Jihad\ that alone does not constitute waging war, but at Ex.P92 there is a reference to such
an extent that the Accused No.1 assured to supply gun, bomb, etc. for Jihad, Ex.P92 (h) further
goes to show that in Jihad meeting Accused No.4 and Accused No.6 were entrusted to identify the
important place and Dargas, which goes to show that the accused had intention to commit the
terrorist activities, such as, blasting of important places including Dargas. The circumstances which
I discussed above goes to show that Accused No.1 to 6 conspired and abetted to wage war against
the Government of India and they have made the preparation in this regard, so also with a common
intention they have kept explosive substance, arms and ammunitions in the secret place. No
materials were placed about the involvement of Accused No.7. As the activities of Accused Nos.1
to 6 at the preparation stage I am of the opinion that Section 153-A and 153-B of Indian Penal code
does not attract. With these observations I answers these points partly in affirmative and partly in
21. After placing reliance on the decisions of this Court in Kehar Singh and ors. vs.
State (Delhi Admn.)9 and Nazir Khan and others v. State of Delhi10, on the aspect of
conspiracy entered into by the Accused and the nature of offences committed by them,
“73. In the above said decision their Lordships have also observed that the most important ingredient
of the offence of conspiracy is the agreement between two or more persons to do an illegal act. The
illegal act may or may not be done in pursuant of agreement, but the very agreement is an offence
and is punishable. Reference to Section 120-A, 120-B of Indian Penal Code would make these
aspects clear beyond doubts. Entering into an agreement by two or more persons to do an illegal
act or legal act by illegal means is the very quintessence of the conspiracy.”
22. In light of the discussion as aforesaid, the Trial Court by its judgment dated
17.12.2011 acquitted the Accused of charges under the provisions of the 1967 Act for
want of requisite sanction. Further, it acquitted A-7 of all the charges but found A-1 to A-
“Acting under Section 235(2) of Criminal Code of Procedure accused No.1 to 6 are convicted for the
offences punishable under Sections 120-B, 121A, 121 of the Indian Penal Code, Sections 5 and 6
of the Explosive Substances Act and Section 25 and 26 of the Arms Act.
Acting under Section 235(1) of Criminal Code of Procedure the accused No. 7 is acquitted for the
offences punishable under Sections 10, 13 of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, Section 120-
B, 121-A, 121, 153-A, 153- B of the Indian Penal Code and Sections 5 and 6 of the Explosive
Substance Act and Sections 25 and 26 of the Arms Act.
Acting under Section 235(1) of Criminal Code of Procedure accused Nos. 1 to 6 are acquitted for
the offences punishable under Sections 10 and 13 of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act and
Sections 153-A, 153-B of Indian Penal Code.”
By its Order of Sentence dated 19.12.2011, the Trial Court imposed substantive
sentences, as tabulated in paragraph 2 hereinabove.
23. Four appeals, as detailed in paragraph 3 hereinabove, arising from the judgment
and order passed by the Trial Court, were dealt with and disposed of by the High Court
vide its judgment and order presently under challenge.
A)      On the issue of sanctions accorded in respect of various offences, the High Court
“34. As per Section 45 of Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, 1967, the Central Government has
named the Secretary of the State Government, Home Department to be the competent authority to
issue sanction order. In this case, PW-73 Bipin Gopala Krishna, Additional DGP has perused the
entire materials on record and recommended for grant of sanction order to the State Government,
Home Minister and the Chief Minister and after it came back to him, he in fact, found sufficient
materials and prima facie case to grant approval, that means he has taken the decision to accord
sanction as under the provisions of IPC, the Government is the sanctioning authority. Perhaps that
may be reason, he has sent the papers to the Government, but actually it is shown that he has taken
the decision on finding prima facie material that it is a fit case to grant sanction order and in fact,
while file came back from the Chief Minister and the Home Minister’s office, consenting to accord
sanction, he sent the same to the Under Secretary to communicate the decision taken by him and
the Government order to the police that, it is a fit case to prosecute the accused. The Government
and PW-73 have rightly accorded sanction under Section 196 of Cr.P.C. and section 45 of the
35.      What is to be looked into from the evidence of these witnesses is that PW-73 Bipin Gopala
Krishna, Addl. D.G.P., Internal Security, has deposed that while he was working as a Secretary,
P.C.A.S., Home Department, Bengaluru, on 1.4.2006 he received a request from the Commissioner
of Police, Bangalore City, seeking sanction for prosecution from the Government and he is the
competent authority to issue sanction order. The entire materials passed through him has been
examined by him and decided to accord sanction and thereafter he obtained the ratification from the
Government and then ordered to issue sanction order through the Under Secretary. We can
understand if PW-73, who was the then Secretary to the Home Department has not at all come to
the conclusion that it is a fit case to accord sanction, the things would have been different, but he
has rightly applied his mind and taken a decision. The Under Secretary of the Home Department
has only communicated the sanction order on behalf of the Government.
36.      As could be seen from the entire records, we would say that it is the decision taken by PW-
73 on behalf of the Government. Therefore, in our opinion, the sanction accorded to prosecute the
case u/s.120- B, 121, 121-A, 122 , 124-A, 153-A and 153 and as well under the Unlawful Activities
( Prevention) Act, 1967 are valid and correct. The trial Court has persuaded itself that it is only the
Under Secretary who has taken the decision, and wrongly rejected the sanction order so far as it
relates to the offence u/s.10 and 13 of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, 1967. In our opinion,
the said stand taken by the learned Trial Judge is not correct. The trial Court ought to have held that
even the sanction accorded to prosecute the accused for the offence punishable under Sections 10
and 13 of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, 1967 is also valid. We accordingly hold that the
trial Court has committed a serious error in doing so. We hold that the prosecution has also proved
that the sanction accorded by PW-73 though it is ratified by the Government or approved by the
Government, it is virtually the decision taken by PW-73 is evident. Therefore, the sanction order so
far it relates to Section 10 and 13 of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, 1967 is also valid and
37.      So far as it relates to sanction under the Explosive Substances Act and u/s.39 of the Arms
Act, PW-70 Ajay Kumar Singh, the Commissioner of Police has accorded sanction, while he was
working as Commissioner of Police, at Bengaluru. He has categorically stated in his evidence that
he has issued the sanction order as per Ex.P-266. He has deposed that, on 1.4.2006, he has
received a report from the Deputy Commissioner of Police, Central Division along with the report of
the ACP, Yeshwanthpur and also the documents like FIR, FSL report etc., and after studying the
report and the documents he has accorded sanction as per Ex.P-266 and he has stated that he has
also issued sanction u/s.7 of the Explosive Substances Act after going through the entire materials
on record. Therefore, the Commissioner of Police, city of Bangalore has issued sanction order under
Ex.P-266 and P267 for the offence punishable under Arms Act and Explosive Substances Act.”
B)       While affirming the acquittal of A-7, the recoveries from A-1 to A-6 and the material
on record were considered from the standpoint as to whether conspiracy as alleged was
proved or not. The questions were posed as under:-
“78. In this background, Court has to consider whether any materials are available to show the
conspiracy between accused Nos.1 to 6 who are convicted by the trial Court and find out whether
the recovery of the incriminating articles at the instance of accused Nos.2 to 7, whether it establishes
the conspiracy being held between accused nos.1 to 6 and that conspiracy is with regard to
destabilize the Government of India and also create any communal dis-harmony amongst the people
of India and whether they are anti social elements and also their conduct coupled with recovery
amounts to any offence committed by them as invoked by the police.”
C)      While dealing with the effect of Exhibits P-27 and P-92 in light of the evidence on
“87. PW4-Firoz @ Firoz Pasha has admitted that A-2, A-4, A-5 and A-6 including A-1 were all known
to him and he knew A4 since childhood. He further deposed that there were two Masjids and this
witness was also attending Masjid to offer Namaz. In fact, the accused Nos.2 to 6 were ousted from
Masjid as their Namaz procedures were different. He has also stated admitting that A-1 came to
Chinthamani and A-2 has introduced A-1 to him on the ground that A-1 and A-2 had become friends
at Saudi Arabia. Though, he denied that, in the said meeting they met each other at Chinthamani,
A-1 has given a provocative speech to other accused persons that the Muslims have to declare
Jihad and he would supply money, Bomb and also give training to destroy India. However, it clearly
goes to show that A-1 to A-6 were known to each other and A-1 came to Chinthamani and he met
all the other accused persons and had talk with them. In this background, one has to understand
the contents of Ex.P-92.”
“94. The sum and substance of the recitals in Ex P 92 (c) and (d) disclose that 'Jihad' meeting was
held between the accused persons and other so called trustees under the guise of a religious
meeting. Abdul Rehaman (A-1) was introduced to the others by Afsar Pasha (A-2). A-1 addressed
the meeting saying that in India Muslims are treated very badly ( terribly/dreadfully) and Babri Masjid
has been demolished. Muslims were killed in Gujarat and all the Muslims have to fight against this.
A-1 would supply money, guns, bombs and explosives etc., In the same meeting, it is also narrated
that the other trustees Firoz, Jameer and Ameer who have not supported the speech of A-1, they
were reluctant to participate by saying that if they do such illegal acts as preached by A-1, that, it
would cause inconvenience to the Muslim community, in India and therefore, they all went away
from the meeting. But other persons A-2 A-4 and A-6 who have accepted the speech of A-1
subscribe their signatures to the said meeting including A-1 who has put his signature and the
meeting was concluded at 8.00 p.m.
95. Of course, there is some over-writing with regard to the date, which appears to have been
overwritten as 10 instead of 12 and there is overwriting with regard to the name of Firoz at item
No.7. But the evidence of the above said witnesses as already noted, it is their case that they are
conducting meetings together for the benefit of the Trust and that they admitted that Ex.P-92 is their
meeting book. It is the responsibility of the accused to explain if there is any over-writing or any
mistake in the said document, because even the signatures of A-1, A-2, A-4 and A-6 have also been
sent to experts and the experts have also given opinion that it is the signature of A-1, A-2, A-4 and
100. The sum and substance of the Kannada version goes to show that A-5 addressed the said
meeting by saying that Islam was sent in the hands of Paigambar, which is superior to all the other
religions. The 'Jihad' has to be declared if anybody causes damage to it. A-6 also addressed the
said meeting by saying that 'Jihad' has to be started by offering lunch (Davat) and if anybody
opposes, 'Jihad' is to be declared at any time. Afsar Pasha (A-2) also addressed the said meeting
saying 'Jihad' has to be declared in the name of God in case anybody is killed they will become
‘Shahid’. A-2 also further addressed explaining what is meant by Kuwath, that “Kuwath” means
“Power” and referring to the hand-writings of the book given by Tariqsahni and Bangladesh. A-2 told
that the power is in Bombs, Bandooks and AK-47. A-2 instructed A-4 and A-6 to identify the Dargas
and other important places for that they all agreed. Ex.P92(g) also goes to show that the next
meeting was fixed on 31.12.2016 by saying so the 3rd meeting was concluded at 8.00 p.m.
101. Looking to the above said Ex.P-92(c) to (h), it discloses and at any stretch of imagination, it
cannot be said that they are all religious meetings pertaining to the Trust, that they have categorically
admitted that this Ex.P92 is the minutes book pertaining to the Trust, there is not even a mention of
any objectives of the Trust and the policies. On the other hand, the entire meetings were held for
the purpose of taking action of revenge, for demolishing of Babri Masjid and killing of Muslims in
Gujarat and for that purpose they are taking training and collecting guns, bombs etc., In this
background, the court has to understand the purpose of meeting of minds of A-1, A-2, A4 to A-6
who have actually participated in these meetings particularly A-1, A-2, A-4 and A-6 in the first
meeting and A-2, A-4 to A-6 in other meetings. Of course, conspicuously A-3 has not been
participated in any of these three meetings.”
“116. Apart from giving the above said report, in fact, some of the seized books have been shown
to him. After seeing Ex.P-76, which is named “Sunflower note book” as true, hand written by one
Shaik Abdul, belonging to Soudi Arabia which was published in Bangladesh. The contents of the
said document spoken to by PW-65 is that-
“Democracy is not suitable to establish Islam religion and it is inevitable to kill to secure power’.
He has also written in the said book at page 16, that “the Muslim community is suppressed
by majority communities and the aim is not to awoke Muslim community and the Muslim should not
prepare with arms.” The meaning is majority communities are attacking on the Muslims. PW65 has
further deposed that in the said book, it is also written that in a democratic system, the Muslims
cannot secure power. The witness has also deposed by looking into Ex.P-81, the book ‘Taqbir’
which contain the quotations like “India will destroy”, to take gun in the hands and LeT destroy the
Kaphirs and 'Lashkar-e-Taiba' is fighting for good things. PW-65 on seeing Ex.P-64 a book by name
‘Jadul Mujahid’ book and its gist is ‘Prophet has told to attack on India. Further, PW-65 has clarified
that at no point of time, Prophet Mohammad has stated so. However, he states that the narration of
the fact in such a manner in Ex.P-64 is provoking and it is very dangerous. He has stated that the
book Ex.P-89 ‘Mujahid-ke-Azad’ is also provocative and anti national. He has also admitted that the
Kaphirs are those who deviate from the Islam path’ and Ex.P-81 also says that ‘waging war’ against
non Muslims. It is admitted that some of the books contain about 'Jihad'. This witness has also
stated that after looking into the books he has given such information he has also admitted that he
has not read the entire books, but whatever the contents shown to him, he has actually disclosed
the same to the court. On looking into the above said evidence of PWs.50, 72, 65 and 29 coupled
with Ex.P92 as referred to above, we can safely hold that the accused persons 1, 2, 4 to 6 have
indulged in provocative and dangerous activities against India, though their acts have not been
implemented, nevertheless, their mind set has been made very much clear. PW-65 is a responsible
person has categorically stated that the books which were recovered at the instance of A-2, A-3 and
A-5 have clearly discloses that they contain very dangerous articles and anti India recitals
particularly those books provoked for destruction of the Indian country.”
F)      The recoveries made from the individual Accused as well as the impact thereof
“120. We have already extensively discussed about recovery of some articles at the instance of the
accused persons. Of course, there is no incriminating articles recovered at the instance of Accused
No.1. Though voluntary statement of Accused No.1 was recorded as per Ex.P.262 and under
Exs.P32 and P39 (mahazars), the police have recovered 1 pocket diary (MO.1), one mobile phone
(MO.10), 1 passport (Ex.P40), 6 chits containing phone numbers (Exs.P41 to P46) and 4 passport
size photographs (Exs.P47 to P49). In fact these articles are not incriminating, as the prosecution
has not able to establish any connectivity of these materials with Accused No.1 with other accused
persons, though these materials recovered includes the mobile phone of Accused No.1.
121. It is evident from the records that from A-2, under Exs.P.129 and P.69, the police have
recovered 1 mobile phone (MO.17), Re Book (MO.18), a small diary (Ex.P130), DL (Ex.P131), STD
Bill ( Ex.P.132), Visiting Card (Ex.P133) and a bill with phone Nos. ( Ex.P134) and also one letter
head (Ex.P70), 1 postal cover (Ex.P71), letter (Ex.P72), 1 passport from (Ex.P.73), 1 Affidavit
(Ex.P74). According to the Investigating Officer, he has not collected any material to connect the
accused with these articles in the crime, therefore, they are also not relevant to be discussed.
However, voluntary statement of A-2 was recorded under ExP.273 and on 21.02.2016 Mos.2 to 9
were recovered at the instance of A-2, which are very much important. In fact, these articles are
incriminating and in fact they are dangerous articles i.e. Electrical detonators, Gelatin Sticks, 114
metal pellets and 3 hand grenade and other articles. Though under Ex.P.105, some books have
been recovered, we have discussed the connectivity of those books with the crime already in the
aforenoted paragraph.
122. From A-3, on the basis of his voluntary statement (Ex.P.272) under a mahazar (Ex.P.15),
some chits containing phone numbers, small telephone diary, courier receipts, small chit of
accounts, three photographs were recovered, which are marked at Exs.P.51 to P.59). These are
also not incriminating and no connectivity is established from these articles. However, as we have
mentioned, the police have also recovered 10 Gelatin sticks and detonators from these accused,
which are incriminating and it gone without any explanation. Under Ex.P62, one passport was also
recovered as per Ex.P63; fromA-3 some books have also recovered under Ex.P68, which we have
already discussed.
123. From A-4, under Ex.P112, the Police Officer has recovered one reliance note book, paper
with phone numbers, visiting card and a leather purse, which are marked as Exs.P113 to P.116
under MO.56. According to the Investigating Officer, these things are also not incriminating materials
and no connectivity has been established. However, under Ex.P169, on the basis of voluntary
statement ( Ex.P.275), the Investigating Officer has recovered one Tin Bomb from this accused and
also recovered under Ex.P.152 some books which are incriminating and also recovered from A-4
and A-6 a book regarding ‘Jihad’ at Ex.P167, which we have already discussed.
124. From A-5, as we have already discussed in detail, on the basis of his voluntary statement
(Ex.274), the police have recovered one note book (Ex.P76) and other books, and also a small diary
(Ex.116), in respect of which no connectivity is established. Therefore, from A-5 no incriminating
materials have been recovered except one note book (Ex.P276) under mahazar (Ex.P 75).
125. From A-6, a small diary was recovered and under Ex.160 ( mahazar) some incriminating
materials have been recovered i.e. 1 small tin bomb, 1 tiffin box bomb with wires, 2 electrical
detonators, 2 wires and country made revolvers marked at MO.23 and live bullets ( MOs.24 & 25)
are also recovered under mahazars, which are marked at Ex.P56 to P166. Except the bombs, the
connectivity of Electrical Detonators, the other materials recovered with the crime are not
126. From A-7, the police have recovered under Ex.P.137 one purse ( MOs.21); Nokia mobile
(MOs.22), telephone number slips, visiting cards and STD booth bills marked as Exs.P.138 to P.142
and also recovered one passport (Ex.P.146), one book in Urdu with picture of crossed guns
(Ex.P.147) and a small diary (Ex.P.148) and 07 paper pieces marked at Exs.P.149 to P.151).
130. On careful perusal of the statement of these accused persons recorded under Section 313
of Cr.PC., there is no sufficient acceptable explanation by them as to why they were possessing
these contraband articles, which are sufficient to cause damage to life and property of the public at
large, if they explode. It is also not explained as to the reason for them to keep all these articles.
According to the learned counsel for the accused, the accused persons are law-abiding citizens. If
they are really law-abiding citizens, why they have to keep such dangerous articles with them. When
there is no reason or explanation by the accused persons for possessing the said incriminating
articles with them, then it can be safely inferred that, the said articles were kept by them for the
purpose of doing some illegal acts in furtherance of their conspiracy, as detailed supra.
131. Recovery of the above said articles have to be tested with other materials on record. As we
have already discussed, these articles have some connection with the conspiracy that has been
occurred between some of these accused persons. Of course, there is no material to show that A-
3 and A-7 in any manner participated in the conspiracy, as we have already discussed. At the cost
of repetition, we may say that in Ex.P92 dated 10.12.2003, 19.08.2005 and 18.12.2005, the accused
persons, who have participated in these meetings, have taken oath to take revenge for the
demolition of Babri Masjid and killing of Mohhammadans at Gujarath. They have decided to join
their hands for ‘Jihad’ by taking training. That means, they have to possess bombs, guns and other
things and use them whenever instructed by their superiors. Particularly in the meeting held on
18.12.2005, the accused persons had also discussed with regard to declaration of ‘Jihad’ against
the persons, who have no belief in Islam and they have also decided to possess bombs, rifles, AK-
47 etc.”
G) The material on record was then looked into to consider as to what offences were
established. The relevant discussion was:-
“141. Applying the materials available on record sofar as these offences are concerned, admittedly
the Investigating Officer in his evidence has admitted during the course of the cross-examination
that, except the voluntary statement of accused persons stating that they are working for an
Association which is declared as ULF i.e., LeT and that A-1 is working as leader for South India
pertaining to the said ULF Association. He also admitted that, there is no other material before the
court and he has not collected any materials to show that any of the accused persons are either
members or taken any part in meeting of such Association or contributed or received any
contribution for the purpose of such association or assisted the said association in any manner. He
has also stated that he has received some factual information from his informants that the accused
persons are connected to LeT, which is an unlawful banned Association. Admittedly, the voluntary
statement of the accused persons cannot be relied upon by the court which incriminates the
accused, as the same is hit by Section 25 of the Indian Evidence Act. The prosecution has to prove
the said allegations independently. None of the witnesses have deposed anything about any of the
accused persons taking part or committing, advocating, abetting and instigating the commission of
any unlawful activities as per the provisions under Sections 10 & 13 of the Unlawful Activities
(Prevention) Act. Though we came to the conclusion that sanction accorded by the competent
authority to prosecute the accused persons for the offences under Sections 10 & 13 of the said Act,
but the evidence placed before the court does not establish any of the said offences either under
Sections 10 & 13 of the Act. Therefore, we do not find any strong reasons to interfere with the
judgment of the trial court in sofar as acquitting the accused for the offences under Sections - 10,
11 & 13 of the said Act. Hence, there is no need for this Court to discuss the decisions cited by
either of the parties to the proceedings.
145. On perusal of the evidence adduced before the court, the prosecution has relied upon the
evidence of PWs. 1 to 8 and 13 so far as to prove the said provisions that these accused persons
particularly A-2 and A-6 in furtherance of their conspiracy, wanted to induct PWs. 1 to 8 & 3 to join
their hands for the purpose of destroying peace and create unlawful disharmony in the society etc.
But, as we have discussed, the above witnesses have turned totally hostile to the case of the
prosecution and they never stated anything about the conspiracy hatched between the accused,
nor they have stated that A-2 and A-6 have provoked them in such a manner which amounts to any
prejudicial to national integrity or attempt to promoting enmity between different caste, creed,
religions, races, place of birth, residence, etc. In this manner also we have absolutely no difference
of opinion to that of the opinion of the learned Sessions Judge. We affirm the judgment by saying
that the prosecution has also failed to prove the ingredients of Sections- 153-A and 153-B of IPC in
order to establish the link between the accused and the offices alleged. Hence, acquittal of the
accused persons for the said offences under Sections- 153-A and 153-B of IPC also does not
deserve to be interfered with by this court.
148. As could be seen from the above said provisions, under Section 121- A, conspiracy to commit
offence punishable under Section 121 itself is punishable even for any activity in pursuance or in
consonance with such conspiracy. Therefore, Section 121 need not be fully established that the
accused persons have waged war against the Government or attempted to wage war against the
Government or attempted to wage war or abetted to wage war. Even mere conspiracy to wage war
or attempt wage war or abet to wage war, is punishable under Section 121 and if the conspiracy is
to overawe the Government, by means of criminal force or the showing of criminal force shall be
punished with imprisonment for life or with imprisonment which may extend to 10 years and fine.
149. Section 120-B says that, when two or more persons agree to do any illegal act or an act
which is not by illegal means, such an agreement is designated a criminal conspiracy and if any
such conspiracy to commit an offence is punishable with death or imprisonment for life. Then such
persons are liable to punishment for a term of two years or more.
150. So, in order to attract Section 120-B, it is clear from the above said provision that, the
prosecution has to establish that the accused persons are more than two in number and they have
entered into an agreement and that agreement is designed for the purpose of commission of an
illegal act or doing an act by illegal means and such illegal acts amounts to commission of offences
under the provisions of IPC and other laws. So far as Section 121 of IPC is concerned, the
prosecution has to prove that the accused persons have actually waged war against the
Government or attempted to wage war against the Government.
151. From the above provisions, it is abundantly clear that if the conspiracy relied upon by the
prosecution is with reference to Section 121 of IPC, then the said conspiracy is exclusively and
specifically punishable under Section 121-A. Under such circumstances Section 120- A and 120-B
of IPC cannot be invoked. If it is done, the same amounts to imposing double punishment. Hence,
we are of the opinion that the conviction and sentence under Section 120B is not sustainable.
152. It is abundantly clear that, if the conspiracy relied upon by the prosecution is with reference
to Section 121 of IPC, the said conspiracy is exclusively and specifically punishable under Section
121 of IPC, the said conspiracy is exclusively and specifically punishable under Section 121- A, but
under such circumstances, Sections 120-A and 120-B cannot be invoked.”
H)       After considering the decisions of this Court in State (NCT of Delhi) v. Navjot
Sandhu @ Afsan Guru11 and Nazir Khan & Ors.10, the High Court concluded that the
ingredients of Section 121 of the IPC were absent in the instant case but the provisions
of Section 121-A of the IPC were attracted. It was observed:
“159. The accused persons have also discussed with regard to the funding for ‘Jihad’ by means of
an association and also they have taken a decision to prepare themselves with the weapons in order
to fight against such activities. These activities of the accused clearly disclose that, they wanted to
take action against the Government etc.
160. As we have also observed that some of the books which were seized from the custody of the
accused persons, it also discloses that those books must have been persuaded the accused
persons to pass such resolution under Ex.P92. Those books contained anti-national recitals which
says that India will be destroyed and Mohammadans should take guns and fight against India, etc.
So the court has to couple the entire material on record to draw an inference as to what exactly the
intention of the accused persons in holding such meetings. Though we are of the opinion that no
damage has been done, no activities have been taken place in consonance with their conspiracy
and there is no heavy magnitude of any damage or loss to the country, nevertheless their prime
intention is to cause heavy damage to the people and the country. We are able to understand this
intention and mind set of the accused coupled with they joining together and conspire to execute
such an intention. In our opinion, their intention and mindset are sufficient to attract the provision
under Section 121. A though not under section 121 of IPC.
161. We would also like to mention here that some of the accused persons noted above have
gone further and have collected Electrical Detonators, Gelatin sticks and bombs. This Conduct
shows that they have decided to implement the decision taken by them, slowly and gradually and
for that purpose only started collecting the materials of such magnitude sufficient to destroy India.
But they were caught at the initial stage of conspiracy while planning as to how to execute their
decision. It is not necessary for the courts to wait for till such time, allowing the accused persons to
collect so much of materials and only after causing damage to the country, countrymen and the
property of the country men, and then take action. In our sincere and honest opinion, such activities
even at the stage of conspiracy itself should be nipped at the bud. Otherwise, it may end up in
causing irreversible damage. Therefore, we are of the considered opinion that the trial court has not
committed any mistake in convicting the accused persons and sentencing them for life. However,
the trial Court instead of sentencing the accused under section 121-A for life, inadvertently by
mistaken notion invoked Section 120-B of I.P.C., which needs to be corrected.”
I)       Finally, the operative order passed by the High Court was:-
“The appeal filed by A1, A2, and A4 to A6 in Crl.A.No 220/2012 and the Appeal filed by the
State in Crl.A.No 530/2012 and the Appeal filed by Accused No.3, in Crl.A.No.1123/2013 are hereby
partly allowed. The Appeal filed by the State in Crl.A.No.531/2012 is hereby dismissed. The
Judgment of conviction and sentence passed by the trial Court is modified. Consequently,
(i)      A-1, A-2 & A-4 to A-6 are hereby convicted for the offence under Section 121-A of IPC.
Sentence passed by the trial Court is enhanced, the Accused shall undergo rigorous imprisonment
for life for the offence under Section 121-A of IPC and to pay fine of Rs.5,000/- and in default, to
undergo S.I. for a period of one year. (Impugned judgment of conviction is confirmed to that extent
and sentence is enhanced). However ,A1 to A6 are acquitted of the charge under Section 121 and
120B of IPC. Accused No 3 is acquitted also of the charges under section 121 A of I.P.C. (to that
extent conviction and sentence is set aside).
(ii)     A2, A3, A4 and A6 are hereby sentenced to undergo S.I. for 7 years and shall pay fine of
Rs.5,000/-and in default to undergo S.I. for 1 year for the offences under section 5 of the Explosive
Substances Act 1908. (to that extent impugned judgment is confirmed). However, Accused No.1
and 5 are acquitted of the Charges under section 6 of the said Act. (to that extent the impugned
conviction and sentence is set aside).
(iii)    Accused No.6 is convicted for the offence under sections 25 and 26 of the Arms Act and
sentenced to undergo S.I. for a period of 5 years and shall pay a fine of Rs.5000/- in default to
undergo S.I. for one year for the offence under section 25 of the Arms Act. He is also sentenced to
undergo S.I. for 3 years for the offence under section 26 of the Act. (to that extent, impugned
conviction and sentence is confirmed). However A2, 3 and 4 are acquitted for the offence under
section 25 and 26 of the Arms Act. (to that extent judgment of conviction and sentence is set - aside).
(iv)     The judgment of Acquittal passed by the Trial Court so far it relates to Accused No 7 is not
v)       Sentences of imprisonment shall run concurrently. Set off for the period of imprisonment
already undergone by the Accused persons shall be given under section 428 of Criminal Procedure
vi)      As we found that A3 has already undergone the period of imprisonment imposed upon him,
he shall be released forthwith, if he is not required in any other case.
(vii) Registry is hereby directed to communicate the operative portion of the judgment to the
concerned Jail authorities for appropriate action.”
24. Being aggrieved by the decision of the High Court, instant appeals by special leave
have been preferred by Accused Nos. 5, 6, 1 and 4. As stated hereinabove, neither any
appeal has been filed by A-2 and A-3 challenging their conviction nor any challenge is
raised by the State against dismissal of its appeals.
The scope of these appeals is thus confined to the challenge raised by Accused
25. Special Leave Petitions preferred by A-5, A-6 and A-1, from which their appeals
arise, came up on 21.10.2016, when notice was issued by this Court restricted to the
question of sentence to be imposed on them. An affidavit sworn by A-1 on 28.11.2016,
was thereafter filed submitting inter alia that he was 21 years of age when the offence
was committed and if let out of jail on sentence undergone, he would support his family
by earning an honest living, without causing any harm to fellow countrymen. Similar
affidavits were filed by the other Accused. Later, the Special Leave Petitions of all the
four accused came up on 28.04.2017, when the Court called for a report from the
National Investigation Agency. Thereafter, by order dated 31.1.2018, Special Leave to
Appeal was granted by this Court, leading to registration of these appeals.
26. We heard Mr. Siddhartha Dave, Ms. Nitya Ramakrishnan and Mr. Ratnakar Dash,
learned Senior Advocates for A-6, A-1 and A-4 respectively, Mr. Farukh Rashid, learned
Advocate for A-5 and Mr. Nikhil Goel, learned Additional Advocate General for State of
The role of the National Investigation Agency in these appeals was only pursuant
to the order dated 28.4.2017. Since the submissions were advanced on merits, there
was no occasion for hearing the National Investigation Agency.
27. At the outset, the preliminary submission advanced on behalf of the State must be
dealt with. It was submitted that the order dated 21.10.2016 having restricted the scope
of the matters to the issue of sentence to be imposed on the accused, the submissions
regarding conviction need not be entertained. Relying on the affidavits filed by the
Accused which led to the passing of the order dated 28.04.2017 , it was submitted that
even the Accused also understood the scope of the matter being restricted to the
quantum of sentence. In response, reliance was placed by the learned counsel for the
Accused on the decision of this Court reported in Yomeshbhai Pranshankar Bhatt v.
State of Gujarat12 to submit that it would be entirely up to this Court to consider the

“4. The learned counsel for the appellant urged that though at the time of issuing notice, this Court
limited its rights to raise points only within the confines of Section 304 of the Penal Code, the Court
is not bound at the time of final hearing with that direction given while issuing notice and the appellant
is entitled to urge all the questions including his right to urge that he should have been acquitted in
the facts and circumstances of the case.
8. The provisions of Article 142 of the Constitution have been construed by this Court in several
judgments. However, one thing is clear that under Article 142 of the Constitution, this Court in
exercise of its jurisdiction may pass such decrees and may make such orders as is necessary for
doing complete justice in any case or matters pending before it. It is, therefore, clear that the Court
while hearing the matter finally and considering the justice of the case may pass such orders which
the justice of the case demands and in doing so, no fetter is imposed on the Court’s jurisdiction
except of course any express provision of the law to the contrary, and normally this Court cannot
ignore the same while exercising its power under Article 142. An order which was passed by the
Court at the time of admitting a petition does not have the status of an express provision of law. Any
observation which is made by the Court at the time of entertaining a petition by way of issuing notice
are tentative observations. Those observations or orders cannot limit this Court’s jurisdiction under
Considering the facts and circumstances on record including the fact that while
granting Special Leave to Appeal, the matter was not restricted with regard to the
question of sentence, we proceed to consider the submissions advanced on behalf of
the appellants on merits rather than restrict the scope of the matter to the issue of
a)      The Prosecution witnesses namely PWs 1 to 8 having failed to support the case of
Prosecution, there was no substantial evidence on the basis of which it could be said that
the allegations against the accused collectively or individually were substantiated.
Further, the confessions of all the concerned Accused were also not accepted by the
Courts below.
b)      The basic charges namely one under Sections 121, 153A and 153B of the IPC
having not been established, the only subsisting charge was one under Section 121A of
the IPC, which was also devoid of any substance.
c)      The recovery of explosive substances, Diary Exh.P-92 and other material, by
themselves were insufficient to sustain the charge under Section 121A of the IPC.
d)      Reading the provisions of Section 120B(1) and Section 115 of the IPC, where the
basic offence under Section 121 was not committed, the sentence could not be greater
than seven years.
e)      In any event of the matter, the trial court having awarded substantive sentence of
imprisonment for seven years under Section 121A of the IPC, there was no reason for
enhancing the quantum of punishment to life imprisonment. The facts on record did not
f)      The only involvement of A-1 was the fact that he had attended the first meeting of
the Trust, which would at best get substantiated through the evidence of handwriting
expert. However, viewed in light of the admission given by the Investigating Officer that
A-1 did not understand Kannada language, signature below the text in Kannada would
not make A-1 liable in any manner in the absence of any other substantial evidence or
g)       None of the witnesses had identified A-1 in court and neither the text of Exh -
P92(c) nor the case of the Prosecution that A-1 signed the same, was put to him in his
examination under Section 313 of the Code13.
h)       Apart from the solitary material of the first meeting of the Trust, there was nothing
against A-1, not even a suggestion of any other meeting or contacts with the rest of the
i)       In any case, the first meeting was said to have been held in the year 2003, whereas
the recoveries in the instant case are of the year 2006.
j)       In terms of Section 196 of the Code, sanction to prosecute the Accused for having
committed offence punishable inter alia under Chapter VI of the IPC was mandatory and
the sanction placed on record did not satisfy the requirements.
a)       The material on record, especially huge quantities of explosive substances as well
as the literature and books recovered at the instance of the concerned accused put the
matter beyond any doubt.
b)       The Diary Exh.P-92 very clearly established the intent of the Accused who had
assembled, who held meetings and had appended their signatures below the concerned
c)       The signatures were identified by handwriting expert, who, duly supported his
conclusions with reasons.
d)       The movements of A-1, who was not a local person in the town around the time
when the meetings had taken place, further lent corroboration and support to the
evidence concerning his involvement.
e)       Considering the large quantity of recovered explosive substances and the other
material including books, literature and Diary Exh.P-92, case was certainly made out for
enhancement of punishment.
f)       The sanction accorded under Section 196 of the Code was rightly held to be valid
and there was no infirmity on any count.
30. At the outset, the submissions regarding the correctness and validity of the
sanction accorded under Section 196 of the Code must be considered. The facts on
record as set out in Paragraphs 34 and 35 of the decision of the High Court disclose, that
the matter was considered by the Office of the Home Minister and the Chief Minister and
consent was accorded to the proposal put up in usual course of business, whereafter,
the communication was addressed by the Under Secretary. In the face of these facts,
the submission that the sanction was not accorded by the competent authorities must be
Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973
rejected. Consistent with the findings rendered by the Courts below, we hold that the
sanction in terms of Section 196 of the Code was valid and proper.
The matter regarding sanction accorded in respect of offences punishable under
the Explosives Substances Act and the Arms Act was also dealt with by the High Court
in extenso and the conclusion arrived at in Paragraph 37 of its decision does not call for
any interference.
31. Turning to the merits of the matter, the evidence on record can be classified mainly
a)       Oral testimony of Prosecution witness Nos. 1 to 8 and 13.
i)       It is true that Prosecution witness Nos. 1 to 8 and 13 turned hostile and did not
support the case of Prosecution fully. However, it emerges from their testimony that some
of them were trustees of the Trust, minutes book of which was produced on record as
Exh.P-92. The witnesses accepted the fact that the meetings of the Trust had taken place
and that some of the Accused did attend the meetings. PW4-Firoz gave details about the
presence and participation in the meetings by various Accused including A-1 and
deposed to the fact that said witness had dropped A-1 at the railway station on his bike.
It is thus clear that though these witnesses did not support the Prosecution case
fully, some of the features of the Prosecution case were substantiated through the
testimony of these witnesses. The law on the point is clear that even if a witness is
declared hostile, the evidence of such witness cannot be rejected in toto but the correct
approach is to accept it to the extent his version is found to be dependable on a careful
scrutiny thereof14.
ii)      The recoveries of books and literature were completely supported by the
concerned Panch witnesses and the Panchanamas on record. The books and literature
did carry inflammatory content and messages. The translations of the original versions
in Urdu were placed on record by the Prosecution. The voluntary statements which led
to such recoveries and the recoveries themselves were also proved by the Prosecution.
One important piece of material recovered from A-2 was Diary Exh.P-92. The tenor
and text of the contents were captured quite correctly by the trial court in its judgment as
referred to hereinabove. The signatures of the concerned accused were proved beyond
any doubt through the evidence of PW67, handwriting expert.
It thus stood established that the Accused had assembled together with the intent
as disclosed from the minutes of the meetings of the Trust.
The explosive substances, details of which are given hereinabove were recovered
from A-2, A-3, A-4 and A-6. Voluntary statements of said Accused and consequential
recoveries effected through Panchas were also duly proved by the Prosecution.
32. Before we turn to the question whether the deduction or conclusion, on the basis
of the material on record, as stated above, was rightly arrived at by the Courts below,
C. Muniappan & Ors. Vs. State of Tamil Nadu – (2010) 9 SCC 567;
some of the observations made by this Court in Lal Singh v. State of Gujarat and
Another 15 in the context of matters involving terrorist activities where arms and
ammunitions were recovered at the instance of or on disclosure by the accused, must be
noted. It was observed by this Court:
“84. The learned Senior Counsel Mr Sushil Kumar submitted that prosecution has not proved
beyond reasonable doubt all the links relied upon by it. In our view, to say that prosecution has to
prove the case with a hundred per cent certainty is a myth. Since last many years the nation is facing
great stress and strain because of misguided militants and cooperation to the militancy, which has
affected the social security, peace and stability. It is common knowledge that such terrorist activities
are carried out with utmost secrecy. Many facts pertaining to such activities remain in personal
knowledge of the person concerned. Hence, in case of conspiracy and particularly such activities,
better evidence than acts and statements including that of co-conspirators in pursuance of the
conspiracy is hardly available. In such cases, when there is confessional statement it is not
necessary for the prosecution to establish each and every link as confessional statement gets
corroboration from the link which is proved by the prosecution. In any case, the law requires
establishment of such a degree of probability that a prudent man may on its basis, believe in the
existence of the facts in issue. For assessing evidence in such cases, this Court in Collector of
Customs v. D. Bhoormall [(1974) 2 SCC 544 : 1974 SCC (Cri) 784] dealing with smuggling activities
and the penalty proceedings under Section 167 of the Sea Customs Act, 1878 observed that many
facts relating to illicit business remain in the special or peculiar knowledge of the person concerned
in it and held thus: (SCC pp. 553-55, paras 30-32 and 37)
“30. … that the prosecution or the Department is not required to prove its case with mathematical
precision to a demonstrable degree; for, in all human affairs absolute certainty is a myth, and—as
Prof. Brett felicitously puts it — ‘all exactness is a fake’. El Dorado of absolute proof being
unattainable, the law accepts for it probability as a working substitute in this work-a-day world. The
law does not require the prosecution to prove the impossible. All that it requires is the establishment
of such a degree of probability that a prudent man may, on its basis, believe in the existence of the
fact in issue. Thus, legal proof is not necessarily perfect proof; often it is nothing more than a prudent
man's estimate as to the probabilities of the case.
31.      The other cardinal principle having an important bearing on the incidence of burden of proof
is that sufficiency and weight of the evidence is to be considered — to use the words of Lord
Mansfied in Blatch v. Archar [(1774) 1 Cowp 63 : 98 ER 969] (Cowp at p. 65) ‘according to the proof
which it was in the power of one side to prove, and in the power of the other to have contradicted’.
32.      Smuggling is clandestine conveying of goods to avoid legal duties. Secrecy and stealth being
its covering guards, it is impossible for the Preventive Department to unravel every link of the
process. Many facts relating to this illicit business remain in the special or peculiar knowledge of the
persons concerned in it. However, this does not mean that the special or peculiar knowledge of the
person proceeded against will relieve the prosecution or the Department altogether of the burden of
producing some evidence in respect of that fact in issue. It will only alleviate that burden, to
discharge which, very slight evidence may suffice.
37. ‘For weighing evidence and drawing inferences from it’, said Birch, J. in R. v. Madhub Chander
[(1873) 21 WR Cr 13] ( WR Cr at p. 19)‘there can be no canon. Each case presents its own
peculiarities and in each common sense and shrewdness must be brought to bear upon the facts
87.      In that case, the Court also referred to the following observations in Miller v. Minister of
Pensions [(1947) 2 All ER 372 : 177 LT 536] by Lord Denning, J.
“That degree is well settled. It need not reach certainty, but it must carry a high degree of probability.
Proof beyond reasonable doubt does not mean proof beyond the shadow of a doubt. The law would
fail to protect the community if it admitted fanciful possibilities to deflect the course of justice. If the
evidence is so strong against a man as to leave only a remote possibility in his favour which can be
dismissed with the sentence ‘of course it is possible, but not in the least probable,’ the case is proved
beyond reasonable doubt'.”
88.      It is true that under our existing jurisprudence in criminal matter, we have to proceed with
presumption of innocence, but at the same time, that presumption is to be judged on the basis of
conceptions of a reasonable prudent man. Smelling doubts for the sake of giving benefit of doubt is
not the law of the land. In such type of terrorist activities if arms and ammunitions are recovered at
the instance of or on disclosure by the accused, it can be stated that presumption of innocence
would not thereafter exist and it would be for the accused to explain its possession or discovery or
recovery and would depend upon facts of each case which are to be appreciated on the scales of
common sense of a prudent man possessing capacity to “separate the chaff from grain”. In such
cases, as stated by Lord Denning, J., law would fail to protect the community if it admitted fanciful
possibilities to deflect the course of justice. If it is established on record that A-20 was found in the
company of A-1 and A-2 at Aligarh and that at Bombay also he had introduced himself as a friend
of A-1 and A-3 to PW 87, who is his childhood friend, then it would be reasonable to infer that he
was co-conspirator and assisting A-1 and A-2, as stated in his confessional statement.”
33. In Ajay Aggarwal v. Union of India and Others16, the role played by various
accused in successive stages of conspiracy and to what extent liability for the acts
committed by other members of the conspiracy could be fastened on the co-conspirators
was considered by this Court. The following observations are noteworthy:
“24. Thus, an agreement between two or more persons to do an illegal act or legal acts by illegal
means is criminal conspiracy. If the agreement is not an agreement to commit an offence, it does
not amount to conspiracy unless it is followed up by an overt act done by one or more persons in
furtherance of the agreement. The offence is complete as soon as there is meeting of minds and
unity of purpose between the conspirators to do that illegal act or legal act by illegal means.
Conspiracy itself is a substantive offence and is distinct from the offence to commit which the
conspiracy is entered into. It is undoubted that the general conspiracy is distinct from number of
separate offences committed while executing the offence of conspiracy. Each act constitutes
separate offence punishable, independent of the conspiracy. The law had developed several or
different models or technics to broach the scope of conspiracy. One such model is that of a chain,
where each party performs even without knowledge of the other a role that aids succeeding parties
in accomplishing the criminal objectives of the conspiracy. An illustration of a single conspiracy, its
parts bound together as links in a chain, is the process of procuring and distributing narcotics or an
illegal foreign drug for sale in different parts of the globe. In such a case, smugglers, middlemen and
retailers are privies to a single conspiracy to smuggle and distribute narcotics. The smugglers knew
that the middlemen must sell to retailers; and the retailers knew that the middlemen must buy of
importers of someone or another. Thus the conspirators at one end of the chain knew that the
unlawful business would not, and could not, stop with their buyers; and those at the other end knew
that it had not begun with their settlers. The accused embarked upon a venture in all parts of which
each was a participant and an abettor in the sense that, the success of the part with which he was
immediately concerned, was dependent upon the success of the whole. It should also be considered
as a spoke in the hub. There is a rim to bind all the spokes together in a single conspiracy. It is not
material that a rim is found only when there is proof that each spoke was aware of one another's
existence but that all promoted in furtherance of some single illegal objective. The traditional concept
of single agreement can also accommodate the situation where a well-defined group conspires to
commit multiple crimes; so long as all these crimes are the objects of the same agreement or
continuous conspiratorial relationship, and the conspiracy continues to subsist though it was entered
in the first instance. Take for instance that three persons hatched a conspiracy in country A to kill D
in country B with explosive substance. As far as conspiracy is concerned, it is complete in country
A. One of them pursuant thereto carried the explosive substance and hands it over to third one in
the country B who implants at a place where D frequents and got exploded with remote control. D
may be killed or escape or may be diffused. The conspiracy continues till it is executed in country B
or frustrated. Therefore, it is a continuing act and all are liable for conspiracy in country B though
first two are liable to murder with aid of Section 120-B and the last one is liable under Section 302
or 307 IPC, as the case may be. Conspiracy may be considered to be a march under a banner and
a person may join or drop out in the march without the necessity of the change in the text on the
banner. In the comity of International Law, in these days, committing offences on international scale
is a common feature. The offence of conspiracy would be a useful weapon and there would exist no
conflict in municipal laws and the doctrine of autrefois convict or acquit would extend to such
offences. The comity of nations are duty-bound to apprehend the conspirators as soon as they set
their feet on the country's territorial limits and nip the offence in the bud.
25. A conspiracy thus, is a continuing offence and continues to subsist and committed wherever one
of the conspirators does an act or series of acts. So long as its performance continues, it is a
continuing offence till it is executed or rescinded or frustrated by choice or necessity. A crime is
complete as soon as the agreement is made, but it is not a thing of the moment. It does not end with
the making of the agreement. It will continue so long as there are two or more parties to it intending
to carry into effect the design. Its continuance is a threat to the society against which it was aimed
at and would be dealt with as soon as that jurisdiction can properly claim the power to do so. The
conspiracy designed or agreed abroad will have the same effect as in India, when part of the acts,
pursuant to the agreement are agreed to be finalised or done, attempted or even frustrated and vice
a)      On 10.12.2003, when a meeting was organised at the house of Firoz at
Chintamani, it was attended by A-1, A-2, A-4 and A-6 along with other members including
some of the Prosecution witnesses.
b)      The minutes of the meeting, as set out in paragraph 17 of the decision of the Trial
Court, disclosed the intent and the objective with which the materials, such as guns and
bombs were to be procured or collected.
c)      The signatures appended below the minutes were proved by PW-67, Syed Asgar
d)      The presence of A-1 in Chintamani on the day in question was completely
established. His presence assumes significance as he was not a local person.
e)      The presence of A-1 on the day in question was adverted to by some of the
Prosecution witnesses. It is true that apart from these pieces of evidence, nothing
substantial could be pointed against A-1 but his involvement in the scheme as one of the
driving forces for the entire design, was quite evident.
f)     The intent and objective disclosed from the minutes of the meeting was carried
forward in the subsequent meetings.
g)     The recoveries made from and at the instance of the other accused show that the
very intent and object as discussed in the first meeting was being carried forward by
these accused with the acquisition and possession of the arms and ammunition.
h)     The kind of material recovered from them by itself shows the potential danger.
Nothing was brought on record to show the reason or the purpose for acquisition and
possession of such potentially dangerous material.
These facts not only show that the basic elements of the conspiracy stood well
established but also proved the involvement of A-1. Going by the law laid down by this
Court, A-1 cannot escape the liability only on the ground that no arms and ammunition
or any inflammatory material or literature were actually recovered from him.
35.    We must, at this stage, deal with three submissions advanced on behalf of A-1.
A)     The minutes of the first meeting dated 10.12.2003 were written in Kannada
language, at the end of which the signatures were appended by all the concerned
including A-1. As admitted by the Investigating Officer, A-1 did not understand Kannada
language. A serious objection was, therefore, raised about reliability of said document to
fasten the liability on A-1.
As discussed above, the presence of A-1 in Chintamani Town on the relevant day
stood well established. The fact that all the concerned Accused got together on that day
in the house of PW-4 also stood established. The tenor of the discussion in the meeting
and the fact that it was not found appropriate by some of the witnesses also found
mention in the testimony of the witnesses. The handwriting expert found the signature to
be that of A-1. In the premises, a mere submission that the signatures of the Accused
were obtained subsequently, without any foundation, cannot be entertained. The
signatures were definitely made in the circumstances suggested by the Prosecution.
The submission is, therefore, rejected.
B)     The next submission was with regard to the gap between the first meeting and the
recovery of arms and explosives from some of the Accused. It was highlighted that there
was about three years’ gap between these two circumstances and it was stressed that
there was nothing on record that during this interregnum, A-1 was in touch with any of
the Accused or had any role in procuring the arms and explosives, which were eventually
recovered pursuant to disclosures made by the concerned Accused.
The conspiracy, the basic features of which were structured in the first meeting of
2003, was a continuing one; which is evident from the minutes of the subsequent
meetings and translation of the intent into procurement of arms and explosives. It can
neither be stated that the thread which was running through subsequent events and
circumstances was broken or that the link between the first meeting and the subsequent
stages was in any way snapped.
C) It was further submitted that the case of the Prosecution that A-1 had signed the
minutes of the first meeting was not put to said Accused during his examination under
Section 313 of the Code.
The record shows that questions about the report of PW-67, the handwriting
expert, at Exh.P-239 (page 194 of the convenience compilation) and about the meeting
at Chintamani and that A-1 had gone to Chintamani (Page 197 of the convenience
compilation) were put to the Accused in his examination under Section 313 of the Code.
These questions definitely invited the attention of A-1 to the circumstances against him.
The substantive evidence about the opinion of the handwriting expert which had found
the signature of A-1 below the minutes of the first meeting and the circumstances about
the meeting at Chintamani and that A-1 had gone to Chintamani were thus put to the
Accused. The instant submission, therefore, does not merit acceptance.
36. The next question to be considered in light of the facts established on record is
about the nature of offence committed by the Accused.
Relying on the decision of the Division Bench of the High Court of Patna in Mir
Hasan Khan vs. State17, which was noted by a Bench of two Judges of this Court in
Navjot Sandhu11, it was submitted on behalf of the Accused that the material on record
did not fulfil the requirement of what would constitute “waging of war” and consequently
there could be no conviction uner Section 121- A of the IPC.
269. The decision of a Division Bench of the Patna High Court in Mir Hasan Khan v. State20 is
illustrative of what acts do not constitute waging of war. That was a case in which there was a mutiny
among certain sections of the police forces on account of the indignation aroused by the punishment
given to one of their colleagues. The conviction under Section 121 IPC was mainly based on the
fact that the accused were among those who took possession of the armoury and also took part in
the resistance which was put up to the troops. The conviction was set aside and the following
pertinent observations were made by Shearer, J.: ( AIR p. 63)
“The expression ‘waging war’ means and can, I think, only mean ‘waging war in the manner usual
in war’. In other words, in order to support a conviction on such a charge, it is not enough to show
that the persons charged have contrived to obtain possession of an armoury and have, when called
upon to surrender it, used the rifles and ammunition so obtained against the King’s troops. It must
also be shown that the seizure of the armoury was part and parcel of a planned operation and that
their intention in resisting the troops of the King was to overwhelm and defeat these troops and then
to go on and crush any further opposition with which they might meet until either the leaders of the
movement succeeded in obtaining possession of the machinery of Government or until those in
possession of it yielded to the demands of their leaders.”
270. Support was drawn from the Digest of Criminal Law by Sir James Stephens. In the Digest,
one of the meanings given to the expression to levy war is: “Attacking in the manner usual in war
(by sic) the King himself or his military forces, acting as such by his orders, in the execution of their
* The decision in AIR 1951 Patna 60 = 1951 Cr.L.J.462 is reported as Mir Hasan Khan v. State. The same
decision is reported in 1951 Cr.LJ 462 as Ramanand v. State. In some of the subsequent judgments it is
either referred to as Mir Hasan Khan v. State or as Ramanand v. State.
duty.” It was concluded “it is, I think, quite impossible to say that any of these appellants waged war
in the sense in which that expression, as it occurs in Section 121, Penal Code, was used”. “The
appellants or some of them were in possession of the armoury at Gaya for several days and it is
perfectly clear that they never intended to use it as a base for further operations.”
271. The next question is whether the daredevil and horrendous acts perpetrated by the slain
terrorists pursuant to the conspiracy, amount to waging or attempting to wage war punishable under
Section 121 IPC and whether the conspirators are liable to be punished under Section 121 or 121-
A or both.
272. Sections 121 and 121-A occur in the chapter “Offences against the State”. The public peace
is disturbed and the normal channels of the Government are disrupted by such offences which are
aimed at subverting the authority of the Government or paralysing the constitutional machinery. The
expression “war” preceded by the verb “wages” admits of many shades of meaning and defies a
definition with exactitude though it appeared to be an unambiguous phraseology to the Indian Law
Commissioners who examined the draft Penal Code in 1847. The Law Commissioners observed:
“We conceive the term ‘wages war against the Government’ naturally to import a person arraying
himself in defiance of the Government in like manner and by like means as a foreign enemy would
do, and it seems to us, we presume it did to the authors of the Code that any definition of the term
so unambiguous would be superfluous.”
273. The expression “Government of India” was substituted for the expression “Queen” by the
Adaptation of Laws Order of 1950.
“121. Whoever wages war against the Government of India, or attempts to wage such war, or abets
the waging of such war, shall be punished with death, or imprisonment for life, and shall also be
liable to fine.”
274. The conspiracy to commit offences punishable under Section 121 attracts punishment under
Section 121-A and the maximum sentence could be imprisonment for life. The other limb of Section
121- A is the conspiracy to overawe by means of criminal force or the show of criminal force, the
Central Government or any State Government. The Explanation to Section 121-A clarifies that it is
not necessary that any act or illegal omission should take place pursuant to the conspiracy, in order
to constitute the said offence.
275. War, terrorism and violent acts to overawe the established Government have many things in
common. It is not too easy to distinguish them, but one thing is certain, the concept of war embedded
in Section 121 is not to be understood in the international law sense of inter-country war involving
military operations by and between two or more hostile countries. Section 121 is not meant to punish
prisoners of war of a belligerent nation. Apart from the legislative history of the provision and the
understanding of the expression by various High Courts during the pre-independence days, the
Illustration to Section 121 itself makes it clear that “war” contemplated by Section 121 is not
conventional warfare between two nations. Organising or joining an insurrection against the
Government of India is also a form of war. “Insurrection” as defined in dictionaries and as commonly
understood connotes a violent uprising by a group directed against the Government in power or the
civil authorities. “Rebellion, revolution and civil war” are progressive stages in the development of
civil unrest the most rudimentary form of which is “insurrection” — vide Pan American World Air Inc.
v. Aetna Cas & Sur Co.18 (FR 2 d at p. 1017). An act of insurgency is different from belligerency. It
needs to be clarified that insurrection is only illustrative of the expression “war” and it is seen from
the old English authorities referred to supra that it would cover situations analogous to insurrection
if they tend to undermine the authority of the Ruler or the Government.
276.     It has been aptly said by Sir J.F. Stephen:
“Unlawful assemblies, riots, insurrections, rebellions, levying of war are offences which run into each
other and not capable of being marked off by perfectly definite boundaries. All of them have in
common one feature, namely, that the normal tranquillity of a civilised society is, in each of the cases
mentioned, disturbed either by actual force or at least by the show and threat of it.”
277. To this list has to be added “terrorist acts” which are so conspicuous now-a-days. Though
every terrorist act does not amount to waging war, certain terrorist acts can also constitute the
offence of waging war and there is no dichotomy between the two. Terrorist acts can manifest
themselves into acts of war. According to the learned Senior Counsel for the State, terrorist acts
prompted by an intention to strike at the sovereign authority of the State/Government, tantamount
to waging war irrespective of the number involved or the force employed.
278.     It is seen that the first limb of Section 3(1) of POTA—
“with intent to threaten the unity, integrity, security or sovereignty of India or to strike terror in the
people or any section of the people does any act or thing by using bombs, dynamite or other
explosive substances or inflammable substances or firearms or other lethal weapons or poisons or
noxious gases or other chemicals or by any other substances ( whether biological or otherwise) of
a hazardous nature or by any other means whatsoever”and the acts of waging war have overlapping
features. However, the degree of animus or intent and the magnitude of the acts done or attempted
to be done would assume some relevance in order to consider whether the terrorist acts give rise to
a state of war. Yet, the demarcating line is by no means clear, much less transparent. It is often a
difference in degree. The distinction gets thinner if a comparison is made of terrorist acts with the
acts aimed at overawing the Government by means of criminal force. Conspiracy to commit the
latter offence is covered by Section 121-A.
279. It needs to be noticed that even in the international law sphere, there is no standard definition
of war. Prof. L. Oppenheim in his well-known treatise on international law has given a definition
marked by brevity and choice of words. The learned author said: “War is a contention between two
or more States through their armed forces, for the purpose of overpowering each other and imposing
such conditions of peace as the victor pleases.” Yoram Dinstein, an expert in international law field
analysed the said definition in the following words:
“There are four major constituent elements in Oppenheim’s view of war: (i) there has to be a
contention between at least two States, (ii) the use of the armed forces of those States is required,
(iii) the purpose must be overpowering the enemy (as well as the imposition of peace on the victor’s
terms); and it may be implied, particularly from the words ‘each other’, and (iv) both parties are
expected to have symmetrical, although diametrically opposed, goals.”
The learned author commented that Oppenheim was entirely right in excluding civil wars from his
definition. Mr Dinstein attempted the definition of “war” in the following terms:
“War is a hostile interaction between two or more States, either in a technical or in a material sense.
War in the technical sense is a formal status produced by a declaration of war. War in the material
sense is generated by actual use of armed force, which must be comprehensive on the part of at
least one party to the conflict.”
280. In international law, we have the allied concepts of undeclared war, limited war, warlike
situation — the nuances of which it is not necessary to unravel.
281. There is no doubt that the offence of waging war was inserted in the Penal Code to accord
with the concept of levying war in the English Statutes of treason, the first of which dates back to
1351 AD. It has been said so in almost all the Indian High Courts’ decisions of the pre-independence
days starting with Aung Hla v. Emperor19. In Nazir Khan case10 this Court said so in specific terms
in para 35 and extensively quoted from the passages in old English cases. Sir Michael Foster’s
discourses on treason and the passages from the decisions of the High Courts referred to therein
are also found in Ratanlal’s Law of Crimes. We should, therefore, understand the expression “wages
war” occurring in Section 121 broadly in the same sense in which it was understood in England while
dealing with the corresponding expression in the Treason Statute. However, we have to view the
expression with the eyes of the people of free India and we must modulate and restrict the scope of
observations too broadly made in the vintage decisions so as to be in keeping with the democratic
spirit and the contemporary conditions associated with the working of our democracy. The
oftrepeated phrase “to attain the object of general public nature” coined by Mansfield, L.C.J. and
reiterated in various English and Indian decisions should not be unduly elongated in the present day
282. On the analysis of the various passages found in the cases and commentaries referred to
above, what are the highlights we come across? The most important is the intention or purpose
behind the defiance or rising against the Government. As said by Foster, “The true criterion is quo
animo did the parties assemble?” In other words the intention and purpose of the warlike operations
directed against the governmental machinery is an important criterion. If the object and purpose is
to strike at the sovereign authority of the Ruler or the Government to achieve a public and general
purpose in contradistinction to a private and a particular purpose, that is an important indicia of
waging war. Of course, the purpose must be intended to be achieved by use of force and arms and
by defiance of government troops or armed personnel deployed to maintain public tranquillity.
Though the modus operandi of preparing for the offensive act against the Government may be quite
akin to the preparation in a regular war, it is often said that the number of force, the manner in which
they are arrayed, armed or equipped is immaterial. Even a limited number of persons who carry
powerful explosives and missiles without regard to their own safety can cause more devastating
damage than a large group of persons armed with ordinary weapons or firearms. Then, the other
settled proposition is that there need not be the pomp and pageantry usually associated with war
such as the offenders forming themselves in battle line and arraying in a warlike manner. Even a
stealthy operation to overwhelm the armed or other personnel deployed by the Government and to
attain a commanding position by which terms could be dictated to the Government might very well
be an act of waging war.
283. While these are the acceptable criteria of waging war, we must dissociate ourselves from the
old English and Indian authorities to the extent that they lay down a too general test of attainment
of an object of general public nature or a political object. We have already expressed reservations
in adopting this test in its literal sense and construing it in a manner out of tune with the present day.
The court must be cautious in adopting an approach which has the effect of bringing within the fold
of Section 121 all acts of lawless and violent acts resulting in destruction of public properties, etc.,
and all acts of violent resistance to the armed personnel to achieve certain political objectives. The
moment it is found that the object sought to be attained is of a general public nature or has a political
hue, the offensive violent acts targeted against the armed forces and public officials should not be
branded as acts of waging war. The expression “waging war” should not be stretched too far to hold
that all the acts of disrupting public order and peace irrespective of their magnitude and
repercussions could be reckoned as acts of waging war against the Government. A balanced and
realistic approach is called for in construing the expression “waging war” irrespective of how it was
viewed in the long long past. An organised movement attended with violence and attacks against
the public officials and armed forces while agitating for the repeal of an unpopular law or for
preventing burdensome taxes were viewed as acts of treason in the form of levying war. We doubt
whether such construction is in tune with the modern day perspectives and standards. Another
aspect on which a clarification is called for is in regard to the observation made in the old decisions
that “neither the number engaged, nor the force employed, nor the species of weapons with which
they may be armed” is really material to prove the offence of levying/waging war. This was said by
Lord President Hope in R. v. Hardie20 in 1820 and the same statement finds its echo in many other
English cases and in the case of Maganlal Radhakishan v. Emperor21 (AIR at p. 185). But, in our
view, these are not irrelevant factors. They will certainly help the court in forming an idea whether
the intention and design to wage war against the established Government exists or the offence falls
short of it. For instance, the firepower or the devastating potential of the arms and explosives that
may be carried by a group of persons — may be large or small, as in the present case, and the
scale of violence that follows may at times become useful indicators of the nature and dimension of
the action resorted to. These, coupled with the other factors, may give rise to an inference of waging
284. The single most important factor which impels us to think that this is a case of waging or
attempting to wage war against the Government of India is the target of attack chosen by the slain
terrorists and conspirators and the immediate objective sought to be achieved thereby. The
battlefront selected was the Parliament House complex. The target chosen was Parliament — a
symbol of the sovereignty of the Indian republic. Comprised of peoples’ representatives, this
supreme law-making body steers the destinies of a vast multitude of Indian people. It is a
constitutional repository of sovereign power that collectively belongs to the people of India. The
executive Government through the Council of Ministers is accountable to Parliament. Parliamentary
democracy is a basic and inalienable feature of the Constitution. Entering Parliament House with
sophisticated arms and powerful explosives with a view to lay a siege to that building at a time when
members of Parliament, members of the Council of Ministers, high officials and dignitaries of the
Government of India gathered to transact parliamentary business, with the obvious idea of
imperilling their safety and destabilising the functioning of the Government and in that process,
venturing to engage the security forces guarding Parliament in armed combat, amounts by all
reasonable perceptions of law and common sense, to waging war against the Government. The
whole of this well-planned operation is to strike directly at the sovereign authority and integrity of
our Republic of which the Government of India is an integral component. The attempted attack on
Parliament is an undoubted invasion of the sovereign attribute of the State including the Government
of India which is its alter ego. An attack of this nature cannot be viewed on the same footing as a
terrorist attack on some public office building or an incident resulting in the breach of public
tranquillity. The deceased terrorists were roused and impelled to action by a strong anti-Indian
feeling as the writings on the fake Home Ministry sticker found on the car (Ext. PW-1/8) reveals. The
huge and powerful explosives, sophisticated arms and ammunition carried by the slain terrorists
who were to indulge in “fidayeen” operations with a definite purpose in view, is a clear indicator of
the grave danger in store for the inmates of the House. The planned operations if executed, would
have spelt disaster for the whole nation. A warlike situation lingering for days or weeks would have
prevailed. Such offensive acts of unimaginable description and devastation would have posed a
challenge to the Government and the democratic institutions for the protection of which the
Government of the day stands. To underestimate it as a mere desperate act of a small group of
persons who were sure to meet death, is to ignore the obvious realities and to stultify the wider
connotation of the “expression of war” chosen by the drafters of IPC. The target, the obvious
objective which has political and public dimensions and the modus operandi adopted by the hard
core “fidayeens” are all demonstrative of the intention of launching a war against the Government
of India. We need not assess the chances of success of such an operation to judge the nature of
criminality. We are not impressed by the argument that the five slain terrorists ought not to be
“exalted” to the status of warriors participating in a war. Nor do we endorse the argument of the
learned Senior Counsel Mr Sushil Kumar that in order to give rise to the offence of waging war, the
avowed purpose and design of the offence should be to substitute another authority for the
Government of India. According to the learned counsel, the deprivation of sovereignty should be the
pervading aim of the accused in order to bring the offence under Section 121 and that is lacking in
the present case. We find no force in this contention. The undoubted objective and determination of
the deceased terrorists was to impinge on the sovereign authority of the nation and its Government.
Even if the conspired purpose and objective falls short of installing some other authority or entity in
the place of an established Government, it does not in our view detract from the offence of waging
war. There is no warrant for such truncated interpretation.
37. Before we deal with the submission, we may extract the relevant provisions.
Sections 121 and 121-A of the IPC are as under:-
“121. Waging, or attempting to wage war, or abetting waging of war, against the Government
of India.—Whoever, wages war against the Government of India, or attempts to wage such war, or
abets the waging of such war, shall be punished with death, or imprisonment for life and shall also
be liable to fine.
Illustration: A joins an insurrection against the Government of India. A has committed the offence
defined in this section.
121 A. Conspiracy to commit offences punishable by section 121.—Whoever within or without
India conspires to commit any of the offences punishable by section 121, or conspires to overawe,
by means of criminal force or the show of criminal force, the Central Government or any State
Government , shall be punished with imprisonment for life, or with imprisonment of either description
which may extend to ten years, and shall also be liable to fine.
Explanation.—To constitute a conspiracy under this section, it is not necessary that any act or illegal
omission shall take place in pursuance thereof.”
38. What constitutes an offence under Section 121 of the IPC is the waging of war or
attempt to wage war or abetting of waging of such war against the Government of India.
The expression “waging of war” was considered by this Court in Navjot Sandhu11.
Paragraph 34 of the decision of this Court in Nazir Khan10 was also to the same effect.
“34. The expression “waging war” means and can only mean waging war in the manner usual in
war. In other words, in order to support a conviction on such a charge it is not enough to show that
the persons charged have contrived to obtain possession of an armoury and have, when called
upon to surrender it, used the rifles and ammunition so obtained against the government troops. It
must also be shown that the seizure of the armoury was part and parcel of a planned operation and
that their intention in resisting the troops of the Government was to overwhelm and defeat these
troops and then to go on and crush any further opposition with which they might meet until either
the leaders of the movement succeeded in obtaining the possession of the machinery of government
or until those in possession of it yielded to the demands of their leaders.”
39. Section 121-A of the IPC, however, deals with conspiracy to commit offences
punishable under Section 121 of the IPC as well as conspiracy to overawe by force, the
Central Government or any State Government. In terms of its application, the width of
Section 121-A is thus not confined to conspiracy to commit offences punishable under
Section 121 of the IPC alone.
In Mir Hasan Khan v. State (or Ramanand v. State)17, the Division Bench of the
Patna High Court brought out the distinction between both the limbs of conspiracies dealt
“The marginal note to section 121A is “conspiracy to commit offences punishable by section 121”.
This was a strictly accurate description of the section which it was proposed to enact in the Bill
originally introduced in the Legislative Council. It is quite clear that the conspiracies aimed at in the
Bill were conspiracies either to wage war against the King in the manner in which it is usual to wage
war or conspiracies to raise an insurrection with the object of subverting the constitution. The
section, however, as finally enacted brought within its scope other conspiracies also and the
marginal note is not a strictly accurate description of what is contained in it. The words “conspires
to overawe by means of criminal force or the show of criminal force the Central Government or any
Provincial Government” clearly embrace not merely a conspiracy to raise a general insurrection, but
also a conspiracy to overawe the Central Government or any Provincial Government by the
organization of a serious riot or a large and tumultuous unlawful assembly. Possibly, in modifying
the section as it stood in the Bill, the Legislative Council had in mind the case of Lord George
Gordon22. Lord George Gordon put himself at the head of a large mob which proceeded to the
Houses of Parliament in order to protest against the enactment of certain legislation. After having
made it protest, the mob dispersed, but certain members of it proceeded to perpetrate outrages in
different parts of the city of London. Lord George Gordon was tried on a charge of high treason, and
was acquitted the reason apparently being that, while he had intended to make a demonstration
outside the House of Parliament, he had not been a party to the disorders which resulted from it.
Section 121 A occurs in a chapter of the Penal Code which is headed “Offences against the State”
whereas the offence of conspiracy is contained in the preceding chapter, Chapter VA which is
headed “Criminal Conspiracy”. The legislature in enacting section 121A clearly had in mind the
English Treason Felony Act of 1848 and I am very much inclined to think that, in enacting it, it did
not aim at conspiracies other than conspiracies which had a political object, that is, conspiracies to
overthrow the existing constitution or conspiracies to prevent the enactment of legislation which was
considered to be obnoxious or to compel the resignation of a member or member of the Government
who had become unpopular. As the section stands, however, I am not prepared to say that in certain
circumstances persons who organize a strike among police men or certain other public or municipal
employees might not render themselves liable to prosecution under it. Clearly, however, persons do
not commit this crime unless it was part and parcel of their plans to overawe the Central or the
Provincial Government by criminal force or show of criminal force. The word “overawe” does not
appear anywhere else in the Penal Code except in this section and in another section in the same
chapter (section 124). In the Treason Felony Act,1848 which the authors of section 121A appear to
have had in mind, the words used are:
“intimidate or overawe both Houses or either House of Parliament” and the words there must be
read in conjunction with the words immediately preceding them, which are
“in order by force or constraint to compel His Majesty to change his measures or counsels”.
The word “overawe” clearly imports more than the creation of apprehension or alarm or even
perhaps fear. It appears to me to connote the creation of a situation in which the members of the
Central or the Provincial Government feel themselves compelled to choose between wielding to
force or exposing themselves or members of the public to a very serious danger. It is not necessary
that the danger should be a danger of assassination or of bodily injury to themselves. The danger
might well be a danger to public property or to the safety of members of the general public.
40. As the text of the relevant Section shows, persons who plan to overawe the Central
or the State Government by criminal force or show of criminal force would be guilty of
offence of entering into conspiracy in terms of Section 121A of the IPC. The dictionary
meaning of the expression “overawe” is to subdue or inhibit with a sense of awe23. The
expression “overawe” would thus imply creation of apprehension or situation of alarm
and as rightly held by the Division Bench, it would not be necessary that the danger
should be one of assassination of or of bodily injury to the members of the machinery or
apparatus of the Government but the danger might as well be to public property or to the
safety of members of the general public.
41. The conspiracy in the instant case, the intent of which was clear from the minutes
of the meetings and the consequential acquisition of arms and explosives to effectuate
the purpose and intent of said conspiracy, would thus come well within the latter part of
the conspiracy dealt with in Section 121A of the IPC. As the explanation to Section 121A
of the IPC discloses, for an offence of conspiracy, it would not be necessary that any act
or illegal omission must take place in pursuance thereof. Thus, even though no untoward
incident had actually happened as a result of the conspiracy, the matter would still come
within the four corners of Section 121A of the IPC.
The conviction recorded against the accused under Section 121A of the IPC does
not therefore call for any interference.
42. We may now turn to the submission based on Section 120-B read with Section 116
of the IPC. Section 120-B of the IPC would apply only when “no express provision is
made in this regard for the punishment of such a conspiracy”. Since an express provision
for particular kind of conspiracy is dealt with specifically in Section 121A of the IPC, the
provision contained in Section 120- B of the IPC would have no application. The
submission, therefore, merits rejection.
43. The last submission was that there was no occasion for the High Court to enhance
the quantum of punishment from seven years which was awarded by the Trial Court to
that of life imprisonment for the offence punishable under Section 121-A of the IPC.
We have given serious consideration to this submission. The conspiracy as
disclosed in the instant matter, if it had been carried out, would have resulted in great
damage and prejudice to the life and well-being of the members of the general public as
well as loss to the public property. Such conspiracies to cause danger to public property
or to the safety of the members of the general public ought to be dealt with strictly.
Considering the acquisition of substantial quantity of arms and explosives as well as the
intent disclosed by diary Exh. P-92, and other materials on record, the High Court was
right in enhancing the sentence after accepting the appeal preferred by the State in that
44. In the circumstances, we do not find any merit in the appeals preferred by the
Accused and as such all the appeals are dismissed.
