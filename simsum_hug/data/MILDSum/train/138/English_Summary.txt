The above interim order is provided only on the lines of the arguments made by the learned Advocate General Mr.Trivedi  and to protect the parties of inter-faith marriage from being unnecessarily harassed".The bench passed the order in a writ petition filed by Jamiat Ulama-E-Hind and Muhahid Nafees challenging the provisions of the Gujarat Freedom of Religion (Amendment) Act, 2021.Senior Advocate Mihir Joshi assisted by Advocate MTM Hakim had appeared for the petitioners and Advocate General Kamal Trivedi appeared for Gujarat Government.
