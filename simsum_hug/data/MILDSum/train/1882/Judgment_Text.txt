1.     Aggrieved by the opinion rendered by the Full Bench of the High Court of Gujarat
in a Stamp Reference under Section 54(1)(a) of the Gujarat Stamp Act, 1958 (hereinafter
referred to as the ‘Act’) , made by the Chief Controlling Revenue Authority of the State of
Gujarat, the Asset Reconstruction Company (India) Ltd., has come up with the above
2.     We have heard Mr. V. Chitambaresh, learned senior counsel appearing for the
appellant and Ms. Archana Pathak Dave, learned counsel appearing for the State of
3.     The Oriental Bank of Commerce (‘OBC’ for short) granted certain facilities to a
borrower and the borrower committed default in repayment. Unable to recover the loan,
the Bank assigned the debt in favour of the appellant herein, which is an Asset
Reconstruction Company registered with the Reserve Bank of India under Section 3 of
The Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security
Interest Act, 2002 (hereinafter referred to as ‘Securitisation Act 2002’) . The assignment
made by the OBC was under an Agreement dated 18.11.2008. The Assignment
Agreement was registered with the Sub-Registrar, Bharuch, on 18.11.2008. In fact, the
registration of the document was preceded by an adjudication under Section 31 of the
4.     However, an audit objection was raised by the Office of the Accountant General on
the ground that the deed of assignment contained a reference to a Power of Attorney
(‘PoA’ for short) in Schedule 3 and that the said PoA was chargeable to stamp duty under
Article 45(f) of Schedule-I to the Act. A demand for deficit stamp duty to the tune of
Rs.23,53,800/- was raised pursuant to the audit objection.
5.     Thereafter, the Deputy Collector (Stamp Duty) referred the matter to the Chief
Controlling Revenue Authority, who in turn issued a notice to the appellant herein. After
considering the reply submitted by the appellant, the Chief Controlling Revenue Authority
passed an order dated 04.01.2012 setting aside the order of adjudication passed on
23.10.2008 and directing recovery of the deficit stamp duty.
6.     Aggrieved by the said order, the appellant submitted an application under Section
54(1)(a) of the Act. On the said application, the Chief Controlling Revenue Authority
referred the following two questions for the opinion of the Court:-
“(A) Whether the objection raised by the Account General, Ahmedabad in audit para, in the year
2008 is proper or not, as per Article-45(f) of the Bombay Stamp Act, 1958 or not?
(B) Whether the Asset Reconstruction Company (India) Limited is liable to pay stamp duty of
Rs.24,94,100/- i.e. 4.9 % as per Article-20(a) of the Bombay Stamp Act or not?”
7.     For finding an answer to the above questions, the Full Bench of the High Court
examined the recitals contained in the deed of assignment and found that the Bank had
agreed to execute an irrevocable PoA in favour of the appellant herein, substantially in
the form set out in Schedule 3 of the deed of assignment. The form set out in Schedule
3 contained recitals empowering the assignee, as the agent of the Bank, to sell any
immovable property. Therefore, considering the fact that Article 45(f) of Schedule I to the
Act makes a PoA given for a consideration and containing an authority to sell any
immovable property chargeable to stamp duty as a conveyance, the High Court came to
the conclusion that the appellant has to pay stamp duty as fixed by Article 45(f). The High
Court opined that merely because the power to sell, forms part of the deed of assignment
under Schedule 3, the appellant could not escape the charge of duty and that the PoA is
required to be considered independently.
8.     But we do not think that the above reasoning can be accepted. First of all, what
was presented for registration by the appellant was a single document namely an
“Assignment Agreement”. Clause 11.12 of the Assignment Agreement contained recitals
to the effect that the seller (assignor, namely the OBC) had agreed to execute
simultaneously with the execution of the deed of assignment, an irrevocable PoA,
substantially in the form set out in Schedule 3. What was contained in Schedule 3 to the
Assignment Agreement was the format of an irrevocable PoA.
9.      The High Court overlooked the fact that there was no independent instrument of
PoA and that in any case, the power of sale of a secured asset flowed out of the
provisions of the Securitisation Act, 2002 and not out of an independent instrument of
PoA. Section 2(zd) of the Securitisation Act, 2002 defines a ‘secured creditor’ to mean
and include an Asset Reconstruction Company. The appellant has acquired the financial
assets of OBC in terms of Section 5(1)(b) of the Securitisation Act, 2002. Therefore,
under sub-section (2) of Section 5 of the Securitisation Act, 2002, the appellant shall be
deemed to be the lender and all the rights of the Bank vested in them. In fact, under
Amendment Act 44 of 2016, sub-section (1A) was inserted in Section 5 of the
Securitisation Act, exempting from stamp duty, any document executed by any bank
under Section 5(1) in favour of an Asset Reconstruction Company acquiring financial
assets for the purposes of asset reconstruction or securitization. Though the said
amendment may not be applicable to the case of the appellant, as the deed of
assignment, in this case, was executed long prior to the amendment, we have just taken
note of the amendment to show how far the Parliament has gone.
(f) (i) when given for consideration      The same duty as is leviable on a conveyance under
and authorizing the attorney to       Article 20 for the amount of the consideration or, as the
sell any immovable property           case may be, the market value of the immovable property
11. For invoking Article 45(f), two conditions have to be satisfied. They are, (i) the PoA
should have been given for a consideration; and (ii) an authorization to sell any
immovable property should flow out of the instrument.
12. In the case on hand, the consideration paid by the appellant to OBC, was for the
purpose of acquisition of the financial assets, in respect of a particular borrower. The
draft of the PoA contained in Schedule 3 of the deed of assignment was only incidental
to the deed of assignment. The deed of assignment has already been charged to duty
under Article 20(a) which deals with “conveyance”. In fact Article 45(f) also requires a
PoA covered by the said provision to be chargeable to stamp duty under Article 20.
13. But what has happened in this case was that under a Notification bearing
No.GHM/2002-5-M STP-102000-2749/H-1 dated 25th January, 2002, the Government
ordered the reduction of stamp duty payable on an instrument of securitization of loans
or assignment of debt with underlying securities, to 75 paise for every Rs.1000 or part
thereof. This Notification reads as follows:-
“In exercise of the powers conferred by clause (a) of Section 9 of the Bombay Stamp Act,
1958 (Bom LX of 1958) and in supersession of Government Orders Revenue Department No.
GHM-98-22-M-STP-1096-2527-H-1 dated 26.02.1998 , the Government of Gujarat hereby reduces
from the date of publication of this order the duty with which an instrument of securitization of loans
or assignment of debt with underlying securities chargeable under Article 20 (a) of Schedule I to the
said Act to 75 paise for every rupees 1000 or part thereof the loan securitised or debt assigned with
underlying securities.
14. The above Notification was amended by a subsequent Notification bearing No.
GHM/2003/28/STP/102002/2065/H-1 dated 1st April, 2003. The said Notification reads
“In exercise of powers conferred by clause (a) of section 9 of the Bombay Stamp Act, 1958
(Bom LX of 1958), the Government of Gujarat hereby amends Government Order No.
GHM/2002/5/M/STP/102000/ 2749/H-1, dated 25th January, 2002 as follows, namely:-
In the said order, for the words and figures “to seventy five paise for every rupees 1000 or
part thereof” the words and figures “subject to maximum of rupees one lakhs, seventy-five paise for
every rupees 1000 or part thereof” shall be substituted.
15. In view of the Notification dated 01.04.2003 issued in exercise of the power to
reduce, remit or compound the duty, conferred by Section 9(a) of the Act, the amount of
duty chargeable in terms of Article 20(a) was capped at Rs. 1,00,000/-. In addition to the
said amount of Rs.1,00,000/-, the appellant was asked to pay an additional duty of
Rs.40,000/- under Section 3-A. The appellant has thus paid a total amount of
Rs.1,40,000/- with the instrument having been charged as a conveyance under Article
16. In all taxing Statutes, there are taxing provisions and machinery provisions. Once
a single instrument has been charged under a correct charging provision of the Statute,
namely Article 20(a), the Revenue cannot split the instrument into two, because of the
reduction in the stamp duty facilitated by a notification of the Government issued under
Section 9(a). In other words after having accepted the deed of assignment as an
instrument chargeable to duty as a conveyance under Article 20(a) and after having
collected the duty payable on the same, it is not open to the respondent to subject the
same instrument to duty once again under Article 45(f), merely because the appellant
had the benefit of the notifications under Section 9(a). Since the impugned order of the
High Court did not address these issues and went solely on the interpretation of Article
45(f), the same is unsustainable. Therefore, the appeal is allowed and the impugned
order is set aside. The demand made by the Chief Controlling Revenue Authority is
consequently set aside. There will be no order as to costs.
