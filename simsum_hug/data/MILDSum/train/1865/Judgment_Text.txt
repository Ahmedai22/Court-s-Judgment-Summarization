1. Sri.Praveen Uppar, learned HCGP accepts notice for

issued by respondent No.4 ( Annexure-G of the

5) Grant of such other relief or reliefs as this

3. Writ Petition in W.P.No.107136/2018 had been filed
seeking for the following reliefs:
“To strike down sub Rule (3) of Rule 3 of
Karnataka    Civil  Service   (Appointment   on
to DPAR 100 SCA 95 dated 12.09.1996 issued by
the respondent No.1 as per Annexure-H.”
4. It is the case of the appellant that the petitioner is
the adopted son of one Vinayak M Muttatti, who was
working as Class-IV employee (dalayat) in the office
of Assistant Public Prosecutor, JMFC, Banahatti. The
appellant being adopted on 08.12.2011 by way of an
adoption deed, the adoption was made on account of
natural born son of the said Vinayak M Muttatti
having     expired   in   a   road   traffic  accident on
5. The adoptive father Vinayak M Muttatti expired on
27.03.2018,      the     appellant    had    submitted   a
representation       on     07.06.2018       seeking   for
compassionate appointment. The said representation
WA No. 100362 of 2022
was rejected by respondent No.2 vide endorsement
dated    07.08.2018  and   by  respondent    No.4  on
16.08.2018 on the ground that the appellant was a
adopted son and the Rules do not provide for
consideration of adopted son for compassionate
appointment. It is in that background that the Writ
Petition was filed.
6. The learned Single Judge by way of his order dated
24.06.2021 dismissed the said challenge on the
ground that the Rules do not provide for an adopted
son to be considered for compassionate appointment.
It is in that background that the appellant is before
this Court challenging the order of the learned Single
7. Another     Single   Judge    of    this    Court   in
W.P.No.211068/2020 has considered all the issues
and by judgement dated 23.02.2022 by taking into
consideration the amendment to the Rules made on
WA No. 100362 of 2022
09.04.2021, has come to the conclusion that there
cannot be a distinction made between a natural born
son and an adopted son.
8. That decision Sri.Shravan Madhav, learned counsel
for the appellant fairly submits that the amendment
made on 09.04.2021 was not brought to the notice
of the learned Single Judge when the order dated
24.06.2021 was passed. But however, he presses the
said amendment into service by relying upon the
judgement    of   another   learned  Single   Judge  in
W.P.No.211068/2020 and submits that the Writ
Appeal ought to be allowed.
9. Sri.Praveen Uppar, learned HCGP who has entered
appearance    for   the   respondents    submits   that
consideration of the application is required to be
made on the basis of the applicable Rules as on the
date   of  the    application   and  the    subsequent
amendment would not have any impact and the
WA No. 100362 of 2022
benefit given by way of amendment cannot be
extended to the petitioner. On these grounds he
submits that the judgement of the learned Single
Judge is proper and correct and does not require any
interference from our end.
10. Heard Sri.Shravan Madhav, learned counsel for the
appellant and Sri.Praveen Uppar, learned HCGP for
the respondents, perused papers.
11. In the present matter, the short question which is
raised apart from the amendment made to the Rules
on 09.04.2021 is as regards whether an adopted son
would have to be treated equally to that of a natural
son     while   considering   an   application      for
compassionate appointment.
12. The aspect of ground of compassionate appointment
arises only on account of any financial difficulty and
or stringency faced by the family on account of the
death of the earning family member who was
WA No. 100362 of 2022
employed in the Government service. It is in that
background     that an   effort is made to provide
compassionate appointment to one of the family
members so as to enable that family member to take
care of the entire family. This being the object and
intention of compassionate appointment, it is in that
background that an application made would have to
be considered.
13. Admittedly, the deceased left behind his wife and son
and adopted son and a daughter who is mentally
retarded and physically handicapped. It is in the
background     of  those  facts  that    the appointing
authority would have to consider the application of
compassionate     appointment    if   indeed  there   is
financial    stringency     or    difficulty  requiring
compassionate appointment.
14. Respondent Nos.2 and 4 in the present matter have
sought to make a distinction between an adopted son
WA No. 100362 of 2022
and a natural son so as to deprive the adopted son of
compassionate appointment. In the present case, the
daughter being a natural daughter, would have been
entitled to a compassionate appointment if not for
her   being  mentally   retarded  as  also   physically
handicapped. In such a situation, it is the adopted
son who was so adopted by the deceased to take
care of the family on account of the death of a
natural-born    son    who    has    applied   for    a
compassionate appointment.
15. In the above circumstances, we are therefore of the
considered opinion that the application made by the
adopted    son  for  compassionate    appointment    is
bonafide and is required to be considered in the
background of the difficulties faced by the family.
The distinction made between the adopted son and a
natural son by respondent Nos.2 and 4 either on the
basis of the existing Rules in our considered opinion
would not have any impact or role to play in the
WA No. 100362 of 2022
matter, a son is a son or a daughter is a daughter,
adopted or otherwise, if such a distinction is accepted
then there would be no purpose served by adoption.
Be that as it may, apparently taking into account
that the same would violate Article 14 of the
constitution, the said Rules have been amended so
as to do away the artificial distinction.
16. Therefore, the contention of Sri.Praveen Uppar,
learned   HCGP    that    the  application  has   to be
considered on the basis of the Rules applicable on
the date on which the application was made is liable
to be rejected since the artificial distinction between
adopted son and a natural son was the basis for a
such endorsement being issued.
17. In the above circumstances, we pass the following:
i.    The appeal is allowed.
ii.  The order dated 24.06.2021 passed by the
learned Single Judge in W.P.No.107136/2018 is
set aside.
iii. The endorsement dated 07.08.2018 issued by
respondent No.2 at Annexure-F to the writ
petition and endorsement dated 16.08.2018
issued by respondent No.4 at Annexure-G to
the writ petition are quashed and a mandamus
is issued directing respondent No.2 to consider
the representation submitted by the petitioner
dated      07.06.2018     for    compassionate
appointment as if the petitioner is a natural
born son without making distinction between an
adopted son and a natural son, which shall be
so considered within a period of 12 weeks from
the date of receipt of a certified copy of this
order.
iv.   Respondent No.2 shall act on a print out of the
uploaded copy of this order, without insisting on
a certified copy. In the event of Respondent
No.2   having   any     doubt  about  the  order,
Respondent No.2 can cross-check the same by
scanning the QR code on this judgement, which
would    lead the    person   to  the  judgement
webhosted on the website of the High Court.
v.    Learned counsel for the appellant is permitted
to furnish a print out copy of this order to
respondent No.2.
