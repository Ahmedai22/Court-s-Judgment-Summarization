the Academic Grade Pay (AGP) of Rs.8000/- with effect from 12.07.2010
and consequential AGP of Rs.9000/- with effect from 12.07.2013 which
has been extended to other Assistant Professors be quashed and set aside.
2.      Facts in brief would indicate that the petitioner was appointed as
Lecturer in Industrial Engineering Department of L.E. College, Morbi
vide notification dated 09.07.1999. His period of probation was over on
12.07.2001 and thereafter he was appointed on a long term basis by order
dated 11.02.2002. By a communication dated 17.09.2007, on completion
of six years of service on the same post, the petitioner was extended the
benefit of Senior Scale of Rs.10000-15200. He was redesignated as
Assistant Professor in accordance with the norms of AICTE with effect
from 28.03.2011. On 07.08.2018, applications were invited from eligible
professors for movement from AGP Rs.7000 to Rs.8000. The petitioner
on 08.08.2018 made an application requesting that he is entitled to the
upward movement of AGP from Rs.7000 to 8000 in PB-III with effect
from 12.07.2010. Thereafter he also moved an application on the same
date for the benefit of upward movement of AGP from Rs.8000 to 9000
with effect from 12.07.2013. By a communication dated 12.09.2018, a
list of beneficiaries of AGP of Rs.8000 was published. The petitioner’s
name figured at Sr. No. 43. The benefit of AGP of Rs.8000 was granted
with effect from 01.04.2015 rather than on completion of five years from
12.07.2005. The remark against the column mentioned that since he had
adverse remarks for the year 2009-10, he was denied benefit from the
3.      Mr. Rustom Marshall, learned Senior Counsel appearing with Mr.
Arpit Kapadia, learned advocate for the petitioner would submit that the
denial of AGP of Rs. 8000 from 12.07.2010 and consequential movement
upwards to AGP of Rs. 9000 with effect from 12.07.2013 based on the
adverse remarks is bad. Pointing out the adverse remarks which have
been annexed to the affidavit-in-reply, Mr. Marshall would submit that if
the adverse remarks are perused, three things appear to have weighed
with the respondents in denying the benefit of AGP of Rs.8000 and
Rs.9000 respectively. Against the column ‘Initiative, Resourcefulness
and Willingness to assume responsibilities’ the petitioner has been shown
to be weak. Against the column ‘Capacity to take quick and sound
decisions’ the remark is that he lacks in taking quick decisions and needs
improvement.        With regard to the details of disciplinary action, the
remark indicates that the petitioner was on unauthorized leave for a day.
Assailing these assessments, Mr. Marshall would in support of his
submissions rely on a communication addressed by the petitioner after
attending the election duties on 29.04.2019 wherein there is a categorical
remark of the Principal that the petitioner was absent on 02.05.2019, on
telephonic information he had informed the authorities on 01.05.2009 that
he was unwell. This, according to Mr. Marshall, learned Senior Counsel
would totally unjustify the disciplinary action that is made a remark in the
assessment reports for denial of AGP.
3.1    Mr. Marshall would submit that though representation was made
for expunging the adverse remarks in the year 2010, it was rejected on
31.08.2010, that itself would not disentitle the petitioner to claim benefit
of AGP of Rs.8000 and 9000 respectively based on the submission that
the remarks were not adverse so as to deny benefits of upward movement
in the pay-scale. Several documents have been annexed to the petition to
indicate the work efficiency of the petitioner inasmuch as he was handed
over additional charge at some stages or also was made incharge of
certain examinations which was to be conducted by Saurashtra
4.     Mr. Krutik Parikh, learned AGP appearing for the State would in
addition to relying on the affidavit-in-reply filed on behalf of the State
would take the court through the resolution dated 30.09.2014.
Extensively reading the resolution it would be his submission that for the
purposes of being entitled to the benefit of AGP the assessment has been
to be on the same parameters as for promotion. The confidential reports
for the particular years need to be examined which is also to be on the
basis of an appraisal that is carried out by a committee constituted under
the resolution. Reliance is also placed on the circular dated 07.02.1995 to
indicate that the departmental promotional committee which considers the
benefit of AGP has to consider the confidential reports of the preceding
five years in question. Taking the court through the confidential reports
in case of the petitioner he would submit that even if learned Senior
Counsel Mr. Marshall’s submission of penalty aspect of one day’s
unauthorized leave is accepted, the remarks against the column
‘Initiative, Resourcefulness and Willingness to assume responsibilities’
and ‘Capacity to take quick and sound decisions’ would indicate that the
petitioner was weak. Merely because the overall assessment was good
would not justify the stand of the petitioner to seek consideration of the
benefit of AGP. He would submit that the assessment was carried out in
accordance with the service records of the petitioner. The petitioner’s
confidential reports for the year 2009-10 were adverse. The court in
exercise of its jurisdiction under Article 226 of the Constitution of India
cannot sit in appeal and reassess the adverse remarks made in the
confidential records of the petitioner.
4.1    Apart from addressing the court on merits and justifying the
overlooking of the case of the petitioner for AGPs of Rs.8000 and 9000
respectively, based on adverse remarks, Mr. Parikh would submit that the
fact that the rejection of the representation attained finality as back as in
the year 2010, the petitioner cannot now turn around and assail the same
remarks as adverse under the pretext of denying of benefit of AGP. For
the purposes of restrictive role that the courts should undertake in
assessing the confidential reports, Mr. Parikh would rely on the case of
State of Madhya Pradesh vs. Srikant Chaphekar (1992) 4 SCC 689.
Mr. Parikh would read the judgement extensively and submit that the
court cannot reassess and sit in appeal and modify the remarks made in
the confidential reports.
5.     Considering the facts on hand when the service history of the
petitioner is considered, what has come on record is that except for the
adverse remarks for the period from 15.07.2009 to 31.03.2010 i.e. for a
period of ten months over a period of five years relevant for the purposes
of assessment there have been no adverse remarks in case of the
petitioner. A positive assertion is made in the petition and which has not
been denied by the other side is that during the 19 years of service that
the petitioner has rendered neither has he received any adverse remarks
nor has he received any show-cause notices or even taken any
unauthorized leave for these years.
6.     As far as remark of the petitioner being on unauthorized leave for
one day, even if the stand of the respondents is accepted, that was only a
penalty aspect considered in the affidavit-in-reply, over a period of eight
months from 15.07.2010 to 31.03.2010, from the confidential reports
what is apparent is that the overall assessment of the petitioner is marked
as good except for the two remarks of the petitioner being ‘weak’ in
terms of ‘Initiative, Resourcefulness and Willingness to assume
responsibilities’   and ‘Capacity to take quick and sound decisions’,
nothing has come on record to suggest the weakness or fallibility of the
petitioner to such an extent that he should be deprived of the AGP of
Rs.8000 with effect from 12.07.2010 and AGP of Rs.9000 with effect
from 12.07.2013. For these two purported adverse instances the financial
loss that has occurred to the petitioner is denial of AGPs consequentially
based on the communication of 2019.
7.     Considering the totality of the submissions and papers on hand,
what is evident is that for a brief period of seven to eight months during
the entire service tenure for which adverse remarks which are referred to
hereinabove have been considered as adverse cannot be taken as
disqualification for award of AGP as prayed by the petitioner.
8.     Accordingly, petition is allowed. The respondents are directed to
award AGP of Rs.8000 from 12.07.2010 and consequential AGP of
Rs.9000 from 12.07.2013 as has been extended to the other Assistant
Professors vide notification dated 23.01.2019. Implementation of the
aforesaid benefit and consequential pay revision shall be done within
twelve weeks from the date of receipt of the writ of the order of this
court. Rule is made absolute. Civil Application is disposed of.
