(2)     Parties in this judgment are referred to as
per their original status in the Suit.
(3)     Plaintiffs      -   Batul       Abbasbhai        Rangwala          and
Jamuna Abbasbhai Rangwala (i.e. the present
opponent Nos.1 and 2) instituted suit H.R.P.
No.1471 2008 seeking possession of the suit
premises      and   mense      profits       along     with         the
costs      of the suit. It is the case of the
plaintiffs that they are the owners of the
properties      situated        in    Kalupur       Ward       No.1,
Near Khadia New Gate, bearing Survey No.2724,
admeasuring about 37 sq.mtrs., having floor
and      Survey   No.2725,          admeasuring        about         90
sq.mtrs.,      and   they       are    in     possession            and
occupation       of   the       ground       floor      and        the
premises of the first floor and second floor
bearing M.C. No.589/A and Tenement No.0114-
1100-0002-V has been given to defendant No.1
as a tenant of the said premises with monthly
rent      of Rs.60/-    since        1970.     It   is    further
their case that the suit was instituted by
asserting       that      the        family       members            of
defendant No.1 and his uncle Fazlehusein are
the joint tenants, as they were residing in
the suit premises and they have not jointly
paid rent of the suit premises since October,
2000 and thereafter, the rent is due for the
period from 01.11.2000 to 31.05.2008 to the
tune of Rs.5,460/- and they are entitled to
get the possession of the suit premises from
the defendants on the ground of arrears of
rent.        Additionally,        it     was    also     contended
that the defendants and their family members
have        acquired     their          own     property           and,
therefore, they are not in need of the suit
premises. In the suit, it was also asserted
that the defendants have become the tenants
of       the   suit   premises         by   virtue       of      joint
family        members   of     the      tenant     and     all       the
defendants are not using the suit premises.
It is also the case of the plaintiffs that
the       defendants    have       sub-let      or    transferred
the       possession    of     the      suit    premises          to     a
stranger and third party is using the suit
premises. With these assertion of facts, the
plaintiffs had instituted the suit to recover
vacant        and peaceful possession of the suit
premises        from   the      defendants         and     also        to
recover means profits.
(4)     The        trial   court      framed       the      issues         vide
Exh.40.        There  are     10      issues     framed      by      the
trial court and after recording the evidence
- both documentary as well as oral adduced by
the parties, it answered the issues Nos.1 to
4, and 6 and 7 in the negative and issue No.5
in the affirmative. Issue No.8 is connected
to issue No.5, whereas while answering issue
Nos.9 and 10 the trial court decreed the suit
in       favour    of   the       plaintiffs-landlord                 and
directed        the   defendants           to      handover          the
physical possession of the suit premises to
the       plaintiffs.    Aggrieved         by     the    judgement
and       decree   passed     by      the   trial     court,         the
defendants filed Civil Appeal No.38 of 2012
before       the Appellate Bench of Small Causes
Court       at   Ahmedabad.         By    the     judgement           and
order dated 12.05.2018, the Appellate Court
dismissed         the    appeal         and      confirmed            the
judgement        and   decree         passed      by    the      trial
court, which has given rise to the present
civil revision application.
(5)     Learned advocate Mr.Vishal C. Mehta appearing
for       the   original       defendants          Nos.2       and       4
submitted that the Trial Court has decreed
the suit in favour of the plaintiffs mainly
by answering issue No.5 in the affirmative,
which pertains to acquiring possession of a
suitable residence by three defendants. It is
submitted by him that both the courts below
have failed in appreciating the vital aspect
that there is no evidence to establish that
defendants No.2 (Aziz Fazlehusein Karaka) and
No.4         (Mufddal    Fazlehusein            Karaka)           have
acquired a suitable alternative accommodation
other than the demised premises and the suit
is        only    decreed       by      resorting         to        the
provisions        of section 13(1)(l) of the Rent
Act by holding that other defendants, who are
the         co-tenants      have        acquired          suitable
accommodation. It is submitted that a decree
of       eviction   can    only       be   passed       when        the
plaintiffs        are able to prove and establish
that       all   the   tenants        have     an    alternative
suitable        accommodation.         It   is    submitted           by
him that even the Court Commissioner's Report
produced at Exh.11 clearly mentions presence
of defendant No.4 in the demised premises at
the time of carrying out the panchnama of the
demised premises.
(6)     In        support    of   his        submissions,          learned
advocate Mr.Mehta has placed reliance on the
judgement        of   this     court      in    case      of      Soni
Jagjivan Narsi vs. Manchhaben Odhavji, 1975
G.L.R. 991, judgement of Full Bench in case
of        Heirs    of    Jayantilal            Kanjibhai             vs.
Rameshchandra Uttamram, 2000(3) G.L.H. 76 and
judgement of the Apex Court in case of Anandi
D. Jadhav vs. Nirmala Ramchandra Kore.
(7)     Finally, it is submitted that the Trial Court
has       not   framed      the       issue      whether            the
defendants are the joint tenants and                      without
framing the issue the Trial Court could not
have      decreed    the    suit       in     favour      of        the
plaintiffs. Thus, it is submitted that the
application may be allowed by setting aside
the judgement and decree passed in favour of
the      plaintiffs.     No      further       submission            is
made.
(8)     A fortiori, learned advocate Mr.Mitul Shelat
appearing for the plaintiffs-respondent Nos.1
and 2 has submitted that this Court, while
exercising       its   revisional           power      conferred
under the provisions of section 29(2) of the
Rent Act, may not exercise its discretion by
setting aside the concurrent findings of both
the      courts  below.      In     this     regard,      learned
advocate Mr.Shelat has placed reliance on the
judgement of the Apex Court in the case of
Helper        Girdharbhai           vs.      Syed        Mohammed
(9)     Learned       advocate     Mr.Shelat,          while      placing
reliance on the judgement of this Court in
the case of Pranjivan Khushaldas vs Dhanuben
wd/o Devchand & Ors., 2001 (2) G.L.H. 223 has
contended that if one of the tenants resides
in       an    alternate        accommodation,             that         is
sufficient for getting a decree of eviction
against rest of the tenants. It is submitted
that the defendant no.2 has admitted that all
the      defendants      are      the    joint      tenants,           and
when        it    is    proved          that      out      of       five
defendants,           three       defendants          have        their
alternate          accommodation,            the       decree           of
eviction        against     defendant         nos.2      and       4    is
appropriately passed. It is submitted that in
view of admission of the fact that all the
defendants         were living          jointly and are the
joint tenants, there was no need to frame the
issue       of    joint    tenancy.         Reliance        is      also
placed on         the judgment of Suresh Kumar Kohli
vs. Rakesh Jain & Anr., 2018 (6) SCC 708.
Thus,        it    is   submitted          that      the     present
revision application may not be entertained.
(10) The         instant      revision         application        has       been
filed by defendant no.2 and 4 only. Defendant
no.1      has    chosen    not       to   appear      before        this
Court. Defendant no.4 has chosen not to enter
into        the     witness        box.      There       are        five
defendants in the suit. Defendant no.1 is the
cousin        of   the   defendant          no.2,       defendant
nos.3, 4 and 5 are the brothers of defendant
no.1.       The   documents       on    record     reveal         that
more particularly, the facts recorded in the
order dated 11.10.1999 in H.R.P Suit No.1991
of      1993   and   order      dated     24.02.1999          passed
below Exh.1 in H.R.P. Suit No.1105 of 1993
reveal that the demise property was given on
rent by one Rukiyabai 60 years back to the
father       of   Fazleabbas         Hassanali,        father         of
defendant nos.2, 3, 4 and 5. After death of
Rukiyabai, one Hussenaben Abbasbhai Rangwala
became the landlord. Faslehussein Karaka and
Safakathussein Karaka were the real brothers.
The plaintiffs are the heirs of Hussenaben.
All were residing as a joint family. After
demise        of   their    fathers,         defendant          no.1,
Zulfikar        Saftakhusein         Karaka     and    father         of
defendant nos.2, 3, 4 and 5, i.e Fazleabbas
Hassanali Karaka was declared as legal tenant
under section 5(11)(c) of the Rent Act vide
order passed in 24.02.1999 below Exh.1 passed
in H.R.P. Suit No.1105 of 1993.
(11) The          suit    is   decreed         in     favour       of        the
plaintiffs under section 13(1)(l) of the Rent
Act        by    answering         the     issue        no.5          as
affirmative by the Trial Court. The same is
“5. Whether plaintiffs prove that the defendants
have built or acquired possession of a suitable
residence.”
(12) After examining the documentary as well as
oral       evidence     adduced        by     the      respective
parties, it is established that out of five
tenants three tenants are residing elsewhere
and      since    all   the      defendants       are     residing
jointly        and   are      the     joint      tenants,           the
defendant nos.2 and 4 are ordered to handover
the possession of the demise property to the
plaintiffs. For answering the issue no.5 in
affirmative,         the     Trial       Court      has       placed
reliance primarily on the evidence at, oral
evidence        of  defendant         no.2     recorded         below
Exh.67, Exh.52 - oral evidence of one Shri
Arjanbhai Sukhavat Bodat, an Officer of Tax
Department           of        Municipal           Corporation,
documentary        evidence        at  Exh.53      produced           by
him showing that defendant no.1 is separately
residing at Baddi Manzil,                 Kalupur, Ahmedabad
owned        by    his     wife,       Exh.55       documentary
evidence showing defendant no.3 is residing
separately          at       Jalali         Park,         Kalupur,
Ahmedabad, Sale deed (Exh.56) defendant no.3
has purchased a property at Kalupur ward. In
the       cross-examination           of    defendant           no.2,
(Exh.67), it is elicited that the family of
his father and his uncle used to reside in
the       demise   property        as   a   joint     family         and
were paying the rent jointly. It is admitted
by       him   that   all     are      staying      as     a     joint
family. Further, it is admitted by him that
he has been residing with defendant no.4 on
the       second    floor.      Defendant        no.4      has        not
entered into the witness box. Thus, the oral
as well as documentary evidence reveals that
three defendants are residing in alternative
accommodations.
(13) The fact which is established on record is
that out of five tenants, three are found to
have          been      residing            in        alternative
accommodation. The defendant nos.1 and 3 are
residing in the premises, which are purchased
by them. Since there is an admission on the
part of the defendant no.2, that all of them
are residing jointly in the demise property,
the Trial Court was not required to frame any
issue       in   this   regard.        The     defendants          have
also not asserted before the Trial Court that
they are not the joint tenants, and the rent
was not paid jointly. Both the Courts below
have       rendered    concurrent          findings        in      this
regard,        hence   this      Court,      while      exercising
its       power   under    section       29(2)     of     the      Rent
Act, cannot upset the concurrent findings on
the fact.
(14) Thus,         the    core       issue,        which        requires
deliberation        in       the       present          revision
application     is   whether        the     defendant         nos.2
and 4, i.e. the applicants can be ordered to
be evicted by resorting to the provision of
section     13(1)(l)     of       the   Rent     Act     on       the
ground    that other three joint tenants have
acquired     alternative          accommodation.         Section
13(1)(l) of the Act reads as under:
“SECTION 13 : When landlord may recover possession
(1) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Act [but
subject to the provisions of section 15], a landlord
shall be entitled to recover possession of any premises
if the Court is satisfied.-
(l) that the tenant after the coming into operation of
this Act has built, acquired vacant possession of or been
allotted a suitable residence.”
(15) This        Court   in    the        case    of     Pranjivandas
Khushaldas (supra) in an analogous issue has
“8. The requirement of Section 13 (i)(1) is that, the
landlord shall be entitled to recover possession of any
premises if the Court is satisfied that the tenant,
after coming into operation of this Act, has built or
acquired vacant possession of or has been allotted a
suitable residence. It is under this ground that
eviction of the tenants was sought by seeking amendment
in the plaint. It may be mentioned that this ground was
not there in the plaint initially. It is only when the
landlord came to know that the tenant has constructed
alternative accommodation that this plea was raised in
the plaint. Shri M. B. Parikh for the revisionist has,
however, contended that the tenants have not only built
alternative accommodation suitable for their residence
but have also shifted in that accommodation. However,
there was no evidence that the tenants have shifted in
that accommodation and that finding was recorded by the
Trial Court, which was confirmed by the Appellate Court.
Shifting to the alternative accommodation is not the
requirement of Section 13(i)(1) of the Act. There are
three situations contemplated under this Section. One is
that the tenant is rendered liable for eviction if he
has built a suitable accommodation. The second is that
the tenant acquires vacant possession of a suitable
residence. The third is that he has been allotted a
suitable residence. The requirement of possession is
only in the second category when the tenant actually
acquires vacant possession of a suitable residence.
Acquisition of possession is not necessary when the
tenant has built an accommodation for himself or for
herself. Likewise, if an alternative accommodation has
been allotted for the residence of the tenant then also,
it is not the requirement of the law that the tenant
must have shifted to the alternative accommodation, so
allotted to him or to her. In this case, the Trial Court
has recorded categorical finding that it is an admitted
fact that the defendant No. 1(a) Dhanuben purchased land
in Wadi of Ichchha Doshi and had built a building,
consisting of three floors, namely ground floor, first
floor and second floor. The plan of the building was
also filed vide Ex. 81. If a three storeyed building was
constructed and nowhere it was alleged by the tenants
that the accommodation in this three storeyed building
was not sufficient for accommodating the tenants after
demise of the tenant-in-chief, it cannot be said that
the claim of the landlord was liable to be rejected. The
Trial Court, as well as, the Appellate Court have
rejected the claim of the landlord mainly on two
grounds. The first is that all the tenants have not
built suitable accommodation for their residence. It may
be mentioned that the tenant-in-chief was Devchandbhai
and, Dhanuben is his widow. After the death of
Devchandbhai, during the pendency of the suit, eight
legal representatives inherited tenancy rights as has
been found by the two courts below. On the other hand,
if     any one  of   the     tenants    builds     a     suitable
accommodation to accommodate all the tenants, that is
sufficient for the landlord for getting a decree for
eviction. Unnecessary time and energy has been wasted by
the Appellate Court in examining as to who has
constructed the house and what was the fund raised for
the purpose and who contributed to the fund for
completion of the house. Consequently, this ground is
not sustainable that all the tenants in common or joint
tenants should have built their own houses separately.
There is no whisper from the tenants that the
accommodation in three storeyed building is insufficient
to accommodate the eight legal representatives of the
deceased tenant. If that is so then, it can be said that
that accommodation constructed by Dhanuben is sufficient
for the residence of all the tenants in common or joint
tenants.”
(16) In the case of Suresh Kumar Kohli (supra),
the Supreme Court has explicated the concept
of joint tenancy and tenancy in common and
“ 20. We are of the view that in the light of H.C.
Pandey (supra), the situation is very clear that
when original tenant dies, the legal heirs inherit
the tenancy as joint tenants and occupation of one
of the tenant is occupation of all the joint
tenants. It is not necessary for landlord to
implead all legal heirs of the deceased tenant,
whether they are occupying the property or not. It
is sufficient for the landlord to implead either
of those persons who are occupying the property,
as party. There may be a case where landlord is
not aware of all the legal heirs of deceased
tenant and impleading only those heirs who are in
occupation of the property is sufficient for the
purpose of filing of eviction petition. An
eviction petition against one of the joint tenant
is sufficient against all the joint tenants and
all joint tenants are bound by the order of               the
Rent Controller as joint tenancy is one tenancy
and is not a tenancy split into different legal
heirs. Thus, the plea of the tenants on this count
must fail.”
(17) The conspectus of the aforenoted observations
of       this   Court   and        the    Apex      Court         will
propose that the requirement of Section 13
(1)(1) of the Rent Act is that, the landlord
shall be entitled to recover possession of
any premises if the Court is satisfied that
the tenant, after coming into operation of
this       Act,   has   built         or    acquired          vacant
possession of or been allotted a suitable
residence and an eviction petition against
one       of   the   joint        tenant       is     sufficient
against all the joint tenants and all joint
tenants are bound by the order of the Rent
Controller as joint tenancy is one tenancy
and is not a tenancy split into different
legal heirs. If these persons become tenants
in common or joint tenants, it is not the
requirement of the law that all the tenants
should       have built accommodation for their
residence. In the present case, the joint
tenancy has been inherited by the defendants
from their fathers who were living jointly
and upon their demise, the defendants have
continued        to   occupy         the    demise       property
jointly. Defendant no.1 is residing in the
property purchased            in his wife’s name and
defendant no.3 has purchased the property in
his      own  name.  Defendant           no.5     is     residing
with his wife at Astodia in a flat. Neither
the      defendants   no.2        and    4    nor    the       other
defendants      have adduced any evidence that
they      could  not   have        been     accommodated             in
the alternative accommodations. The report
of the Court Commissioner, Exh.11 indicates
that except defendant no.4, no one was found
present in the demise property.                    Hence, when
three      defendants     have       been     found      to      have
been residing separately and defendant nos.1
and 3 are residing in the property owned by
them,      the   defendant          nos.2      and     4     cannot
insist upon occupying the demise property.
Thus, even if no evidence has emerged that
the defendant nos.2 and 4 have not acquired
any property, their eviction from the demise
property      can   be    ordered         in    wake      of       the
established        evidence           that      other          joint
tenants have acquired their property and are
living residing separately.
(18) Reliance placed by learned Advocate Mr.Mehta
on the judgement of this Court in the case of
Soni Jagjivan Narsi (supra) cannot come to
the rescue to the applicants, since in the
case before the Coordinate Bench, the matter
was remanded to the Trial Court since there
was no finding with regard to the suitable
premises/       residence         within      the     meaning          of
section       13(1)(l)       of        the    Rent      Act.         The
Coordinate Bench has held that the real test,
which      is   to   be    applied         is    that      the        new
premises which a tenant has taken on “rent”
is sufficient to accommodate himself and all
his “dependents” or not and if it is found
that they can be accommodated then certainly,
he can be evicted under section 13(1)(l) of
the Rent Act. In the present case, two of the
defendants,        who      have         actually        purchased
separate properties and the defendant nos.2
and 4 are not their “dependents”. All were
living       jointly     and        paying       rent      jointly.
Hence, the aforementioned judgments will not
encompass the facts and issue raised in the
present       case.   Similarly,            in    the     case         of
Anandi D. Jadhav (supra), the facts suggest
that the heirs or sons of the tenant were not
the      tenant   of  the       demise       property,         though
they      were   living       with       their      mother,           and
mother      was   the     only        tenant.      The     case        of
Anandi D. Jadhav (supra) has been relied upon
by the Full Bench of this Court in case of
Heirs      of  Jayantilal          Kanjibhai       (supra).           The
Full      Bench    was   dealing       with     the     case        of
husband and wife, who acquire the subsequent
property and their statutory and legal right
with      regard    to  the      acquired      property.           The
issue       of  the   joint       tenancy    was     not      under
scrutiny before the Full Bench.
(19) Finally, I may take notice of the judgement
of      the   Apex   Court     in    the    case     of     Helper
Girdharbhai (supra) in context of exercise of
powers by the High Court under the provisions
of Section 29(2) of the Rent Act has held
“16. ... ... ... We must, however, guard ourselves
against permitting in the guise of revision substitution
of one view where two views are possible and the Court
of Small Causes has taken a particular view. If a
possible view has been taken, the High Court would be
exceeding its jurisdiction to substitute its own view
with that of the courts below because it considers it to
be a better view. The fact that the High Court would
have taken a different view is wholly irrelevant. Judged
by that standard, we are of the opinion that the High
Court in this case had exceeded its jurisdiction.
17. In the case of Punamchandra Revashankar Joshi v.
Ramjibhai Maganlal (1966) 7 Guj. LR 807, the Gujarat
High Court after dealing with the Gujarat Amendment Act
(XVIII) of 1966 observed that the Legislature had not
intended to equate the ambit of the power with the one
exercised in an appeal. The authority vested in the High
Court under the Amendment still remained only in the
domain of the jurisdiction and power of revision and no
further. The Amending provision, therefore, only related
to procedure and not to any rights of the parties.
18. This Court in the case of Bhai Chand Ratanshi v.
1981 SC 1690) observed that where lower courts applied
their minds properly in deciding a matter under Section
13(2) of the Bombay Rent Act, the High Court could not
substitute its own finding for the one reached by the
courts below, on a reappraisal of evidence under Section
29(2) of the Act as substituted by the Gujarat Act 18 of
1965. This Court reiterated that although the High Court
had wider power than that which could be exercised under
Section 115 of C.P.C., yet its revisional power could
only be exercised for a limited purpose with a view to
satisfying itself that the decision was according to
law. The High Court could not substitute its own finding
for the one reached by the courts below on a reappraisal
of evidence.”
(20) Thus,        as  enunciated        by    the    Supreme        Court,
this Court can exercise its revisional power
under section 29(2) of the Rent Act for a
limited purpose with a view to satisfy itself
that     the  decision    of       the   Courts      below        was
according to law and the High Court cannot
substitute      its   own        finding       for     the        one
reached by the Courts below on reappraisal of
evidence.
(21) The          revision     application             fails          legal
scrutiny,      hence     is         dismissed.        RULE          is
discharged.
(22) Record and proceedings be sent back to the
concerned Court forthwith.
After the pronouncement of the above judgment,
learned           advocate  Mr.Mehta         for    the      applicants
requests for stay of the judgment.
For      the  reasons    recorded       hereinabove,             the
request           for  extending      the     interim       relief          is
