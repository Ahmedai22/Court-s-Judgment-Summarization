1.      IA No. 76416/2021 (M.A. No.1166 of 2021) has been filed by respondent No.1 for
clarification of the judgment and order dated 13th April 2021 passed in Civil Appeal No.
8129 of 2019, praying therein to clarify that this Court, in the said judgment and order
dated 13th April 2021, has not dealt with the aspect of security of pledge of shares with
EARC having been arbitrarily and illegally wiped out in the Resolution Plan and
invocation/non-invocation of pledge of shares by EARC. It is further prayed in the said
application that this Court should not only expunge the observations made by the
National Company Law Tribunal in common order dated 22nd June, 2018 as found in
paragraphs 104 and 105 of the said judgment and order dated 13th April, 2021 of this
Court in Civil Appeal No.8129 of 2019, but should also direct the National Company Law
Appellate Tribunal to not be influenced by the said observations while deciding Review
Application No.17 of 2019.
2.      IA No.52435/2022 has been filed on behalf of Adhunik Power and Natural
Resources Ltd., seeking intervention to support the application for clarification filed by
3.      We have heard Mr. C.S.Vaidyanathan, learned Senior Counsel appearing on
behalf of the applicant/respondent No.1- Edelweiss Asset Reconstruction Company
(EARC) in M.A. No. 1166 of 2021, Mr. Vikas Singh, learned Senior Counsel appearing
on behalf of the applicant in IA No. 52435/2022, and Dr. Abhishek Manu Singhvi, learned
Senior Counsel appearing on behalf of the original appellant.
4.     Having heard learned senior counsel for the parties and having perused the
relevant materials placed on record, we are of the considered view that the present
applications are nothing else but an attempt to seek review of the judgment and order
passed by this Court on 13th April 2021 under the garb of miscellaneous application.
5.     We find that there is a growing tendency of indirectly seeking review of the orders
of this Court by filing applications either seeking modification or clarification of the orders
passed by this Court.
6.     In our view, such applications are a total abuse of process of law. The valuable
time of Court is spent in deciding such applications which time would otherwise be utilized
for attending litigations of the litigants who are waiting in the corridors of justice for
decades together.
7.     The applications are therefore dismissed with cost of Rs.10,00,000/- (Rupees ten
lakhs) each to be paid by the applicants within four weeks from the date of this order.
The cost of Rs.10,00,000/- imposed on the applicant in M.A. No. 1166 of 2021 shall be
deposited in the Supreme Court Advocates-on-Record Association Welfare Fund
(SCAORAWF) (Account No.02070110092378 and IFSC Code - UCBA0000207) and the
cost of Rs.10,00,000/- imposed on the applicant in I.A. No.52435 of 2022 shall be
deposited with the Supreme Court Bar Association Advocates Welfare Fund (Account
No.02070110049617 and IFSC Code UCBA0000207).
8.     We, however, clarify that our observations are restricted to the present applications
only and they would not affect the proceedings before appropriate forums, if the
applicants are entitled to any remedy before any other forum(s) in accordance with law.
9.     Miscellaneous Application as well as I.A. for intervention stand disposed of.
