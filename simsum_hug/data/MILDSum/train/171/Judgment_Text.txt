Counsel for Applicant :- Tanay Hazari
Counsel for Opposite Party :- G.A.
1.               Heard learned counsel for the applicants,
learned A.G.A. for the State and perused the entire
2.               The instant application under Section 482
Cr.P.C. has been filed by the applicants praying inter
alia the following reliefs:-
"a. Issue and order for quashing the
Proceedings and Set aside the Bail
Cancellation Order dated 01.09.2022
under the Sessions Trial No. 812/2021 in
re: State of U.P. v. Ram Bachan and Ors
delivered by the Ld. Sessions Judge
annexed as Annexure No. 1.
b. Issue an order directing the Police to
release the Applicants from Judicial
Custody on Bail."
3.               In view of the order which is proposed to be
passed today, notice to opposite party No.2 is hereby
dispensed with.
4.               From the pleadings, it transpires that the
applicants           were        granted bail vide  order   dated
Application U/s 482 No.6779 of 2022                       Page-1 of 8
22.11.2021 passed by the learned Sessions Judge,
Raebareli in Bail Application No.2638 of 2021 arising
out of Sessions Trial No.812 of 2021 (State vs. Ram
Bachan and others).
5.               The learned trial court was informed that the
witnesses           and      the    complainant of the aforesaid
Sessions Trial No.812 of 2021 are being threatened of
dire consequences by the applicants herein. The
aforesaid Sessions Trial No.812 of 2021 was fixed on
01.09.2022 for recording evidence of prosecution
witnesses. However, taking note of the fact that the
present applicants are threatening the witnesses and
the complainant to desist from prosecuting the case,
the learned trial court kept the application moved to
the aforesaid effect on record and a copy of the same
was directed to be sent to Superintendent of Police,
Raebareli for appropriate action directing him also to
provide necessary security to the witnesses by the
learned trial court.
6.               The learned trial court thereafter found that
by the order dated 22.11.2021 passed in the Bail
Application No.2683 of 2021, the applicants herein
were enlarged on bail, inter alia, on the condition that
they shall not temper with the evidence and shall also
not intimidate the witnesses. They shall also not seek
any adjournment, if the witnesses are present for
being examined. In case of seeking adjournment when
the prosecution witnesses are present, the same shall
be considered as misuse of liberty of bail granted to
Application U/s 482 No.6779 of 2022                      Page-2 of 8
the applicants. Thereafter, the learned trial court found
the aforesaid conduct of the applicants to be violation
of conditions of bail subject to which they were
enlarged          on      bail     vide   order   dated  22.11.2021.
Therefore, the learned trial court directed to the
applicants to be taken into custody and also passed
the impugned order dated 01.09.2022 canceling the
bail granted to the applicants vide order dated
22.11.2021 passed in Bail Application No.2638 of
2021. Consequently, the applicants were directed to
be lodged in the District Jail.
7.               In aforesaid factual background, it has been
submitted by the learned counsel for the applicants
that the impugned order is patently illegal insofar as it
has been passed on the basis of vague allegations
levelled against the applicants. It has also been
submitted that it is settled law that parameters for
grant of bail and for cancelling an order granting bail
are settled and specified. The cancellation of bail is a
serious matter and should be dealt with accordingly as
the same concerns, the personal liberty of the persons
who have been enlarged on bail.
8.               Learned         counsel    for  the  applicants    has
further        submitted           that  in   case,  there   was    any
grievance to the victim, the complainant or any
witness as aforesaid, they were at liberty to move an
application for cancellation of bail of the applicants
who would have got an opportunity of showing cause
by     filing       a    reply      to  the    same   and   thereafter
Application U/s 482 No.6779 of 2022                            Page-3 of 8
appropriate             order        based   on   the   facts     and
circumstances of this matter, could have been passed
by the learned trial court. However, the impugned
order has come to be passed in flagrant violation of
the settled procedure in respect of cancellation of bail
which is not sustainable at all.
9.               Per contra, learned A.G.A. has opposed the
prayer by stating that the impugned order has been
passed by the learned trial court to ensure proper
conduct of trial of Sessions Trial No.812 of 2021.
However, he has very fairly stated that the same could
not have been passed without issuing notice to the
opposite          party         No.2    and  without  affording       a
reasonable opportunity of showing cause to the
10.              Having heard the learned counsel for the
applicants, learned A.G.A. for the State and upon
perusal of record, it requires to be made clear that it is
settled law that once bail has been granted by a
competent court after due consideration of facts and
circumstances of the case, the same should not be
cancelled in a mechanical manner without there being
any       supervening             circumstance(s)  which   are    not
conducive to the fair trial. It cannot be cancelled on a
prayer or request from the side of the complainant/
investigating agency/ victim, unless and until, it is
shown to the satisfaction of the court concerned that
the same is being misused and is no longer conducive,
in the interest of justice, to allow the accused persons
Application U/s 482 No.6779 of 2022                          Page-4 of 8
any further to remain on bail. No doubt, the bail can
be cancelled only in those discerning few cases where
it is established that a person to whom the concession
of bail has been granted, is misusing the same.
11.              The Hon'ble Supreme Court in Samarendra
Nath Bhattacharjee vs. State of W.B. and another
reported in (2004) 11 SCC 165, has pointed out as
to what should be the approach of the court dealing
with the matter of cancellation of bail. In the instant
case, the High Court cancelled the bail which was
earlier granted to the accused. The Hon'ble Supreme
Court observed that the High Court has approached
the case as if it is an appeal against the conviction by
giving findings on factual issues which are yet to be
decided. Thus, the Hon'ble Supreme Court found the
matter to be too premature which is likely to prejudice
the trial. That apart, since the only ground on which
the cancellation of bail could have been ordered being
the      ground         of     intimidation,  the  same   was    not
satisfactorily proved. Therefore, in view of the Hon'ble
Supreme Court, the High Court erred in cancelling the
bail granted to the accused.
12.              In the case at hand too, the fact of alleged
intimidation or extending threat to the complainant
and witnesses, was intimated to the learned trial
court.       No      application      stating  the  facts of   such
intimidation was moved to the learned trial court. Be
that as it may, the learned trial court atleast ought to
have provided a reasonable and sufficient opportunity
Application U/s 482 No.6779 of 2022                         Page-5 of 8
to the applicants/ accused persons to show cause
against such an application or prayer made by the
prosecution for cancellation of the bail granted to the
applicants as the same was likely to affect personal
liberty of the applicants/ accused persons adversely.
13.              In Mehboob Dawood Shaikh vs. State of
Maharashtra reported in (2004) 2 SCC 362, it has
been held by the Hon'ble Supreme Court that the
cancellation of bail are never be resorted to lightly.
14.              The Hon'ble Supreme Court in            Gurdev
Singh and another vs. State of Bihar and another
reported in (2005) 13 SCC 286, has held that
cancellation of bail cannot done without giving notice
to the accused and giving him an opportunity of being
15.              In P.K. Shaji alias Thammanam Shaji vs.
State of Kerala reported in (2005) 13 SCC 283, the
Hon'ble Supreme Court has again held that the
accused must be heard before his bail is cancelled.
16.              In     view      of the aforesaid settled   legal
propositions, this court finds the impugned order
which came to be passed by the learned trial court
without issuing notice to the applicants and without
affording them a reasonable and sufficient opportunity
of hearing is patently illegal being in flagrant violation
of whatever has been held by the Hon'ble Supreme
Court in Samarendra Nath Bhattacharjee's case
(supra),             Mehboob          Dawood    Shaikh's     case
Application U/s 482 No.6779 of 2022                       Page-6 of 8
(supra), Gurdev Singh's case (supra) and in P.K.
Shaji alias Thammanam Shaji's case (supra). it
has, thus, caused miscarriage of justice to the
17.              The upshot of aforesaid discussion is that
the instant application under Section 482 Cr.P.C.
deserves to be allowed and the impugned order dated
01.09.2022 passed by the learned Sessions Judge,
Raebareli in Sessions Trial No.812 of 2021 (State vs.
Ram Bachan and others) also deserves to be set aside
to the extent it concerns cancellation of bail granted to
the applicants and taking them into custody as a
consequence thereof only.
18.              Accordingly, the instant application under
Section 482 Cr.P.C. is allowed. The impugned order
dated 01.09.2022 passed by the learned Sessions
Judge, Raebareli in Sessions Trial No.812 of 2021
(State vs. Ram Bachan and others) is hereby set aside
as indicated above.
19.              The learned trial court is directed to release
the applicants after obtaining the fresh personal bonds
and two sureties each in the like amount to the
satisfaction of the court concerned.
20.              It is also made clear that the learned trial
court shall be at liberty to issue notice to the
applicants stating therein the grounds which are to be
considered by it for cancellation of bail granted to the
applicants.          It    shall    thereafter decide the   same
Application U/s 482 No.6779 of 2022                       Page-7 of 8
expeditiously in accordance with law after affording
reasonable opportunity of hearing to the parties.
