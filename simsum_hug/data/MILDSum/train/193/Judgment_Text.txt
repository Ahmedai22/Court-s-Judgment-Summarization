Heard learned counsel for the petitioner. Perused the
pleadings in the case along with the accompanying record.
1)     Every   case in which either the District Magistrate or the
Government is approached by the law enforcement agencies for
seeking a preventive detention of a citizen of India, every such case
demands and expects a very fact sensitive and law centric
application and approach of mind on the part of and by the holders
of preventive detention jurisdiction. An application of law lives in its
seriousness, and the law detests non-seriousness on the part of law
operating hands and minds. The preventive detention law is no
exception to this demand and command.
2)     The present case is an example of sheer non-seriousness on
the part of the District Magistrate Kupwara in dishing out a
preventive detention order against the petitioner by literally acting
as a post-office as if delivering a dossier of the Superintendent of
Police, Handwara asking for the preventive detention of the
petitioner under the provisions of the Jammu & Kashmir Public
Safety Act, 1978. In the present writ petition, the petitioner having
suffered loss of his personal liberty, is seeking the quashment of
preventive detention order no. 17-DMK/PSA of 2022 dated
24.06.2022 issued by the District Magistrate Kupwara which came
to be executed against him to land him languish in the District Jail
3)     The factual background gatherable from the pleadings and
the documents accompanying therewith is that by virtue of a
dossier no. Pross/Dossier/2022/3290-93 dated 23.06.2022, the
Superintendent of Police, Handwara came to approach the District
Magistrate Kupwara seeking the invocation of the power of the
District Magistrate as vested under section 8 of the Jammu &
Kashmir Public Safety Act, 1978 for subjecting the petitioner to
preventive detention as the petitioner’s personal liberty was
reckoned to be likelihood of threat to fragile law and order situation
and harm to the security forces in the Qaziabad area. The dossier
of the Superintendent of Police, Handwara painted and portrayed
the petitioner as an aide of Lashar-e-Taiba (LeT) outfit.
4)     The recital for so depicting the petitioner as such is drawn
from the purported facts and circumstances upon which the
petitioner was earlier subjected to suffer preventive detention by
virtue of preventive detention order no. 58/DMK/PSA of 2019
dated 19.10.2019 passed by the District Magistrate Kupwara which
came to be quashed by this Court in WP (Crl) no.127/2020 vide
judgment dated 28.06.2021.
5)      As soon as the petitioner was restored back his personal
liberty, within one year thereafter the Superintendent of Police,
Handwara came forward with the dossier for seeking second time
preventive detention of the petitioner. For the period intervening the
date of quashment of first detention order by virtue of judgment
dated 28.06.2021 and the issuance of second preventive detention
order no. 17-DMK/PSA of 2022 dated 24.06.2022, impugned
herein,   there is no factual content stated in the dossier by the
Superintendent of Police Handwara on the basis of which the
petitioner could be said to have indulged in acts of omission or
commission whereby his personal liberty was reckoned as a
circumstance posing live threat to the so called security of the
State. Thus, the dossier so served by the Superintendent of Police
Handwara before the District Judge Kupwara was nothing but
repetition of the premise upon which the first detention order
58/DMK/PSA of 2019 dated 19.10.2019 was passed.
6)      Post his release by quashment of above said first detention
order which had made the petitioner to suffer stay behind the jail
bars for a period of four months short of two years, the petitioner
was put on a bond for keeping peace by reference to proceedings
under section 107/151 of the Code of Criminal Procedure 1973
dated 14.08.2021, 08.10.2021 and 24.01.2022. In the dossier it is
no where mentioned that the petitioner ever breached his bonds so
given under section 107 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973
and still the petitioner came to be branded as a case for detention
under the Public Safety Act, 1978.
7)     When it came to the matter of applying mind to the issue
whether to subject the petitioner to suffer preventive detention
upon the basis of the dossier so served by the Superintendent of
Police, Handwara before him, the District Magistrate Kupwara
seems to have        relieved himself from  labour   and effort of
independent application of mind to the dossier case put up by the
Superintendent of Police Kupwara and instead           the District
Magistrate Kupwara simply carried out re-typing of the dossier in
the name of showing so called application of mind. So much so,
even the typographical error/s and omission of the dossier
was/were imported and repeated as it is by the District Magistrate
Kupwara. In this regard, reference is made to a date given in the
dossier which is 01.03.2009 vis-à-vis an incident which is then
shown to be of 01.03.2019 on the basis of which FIR no. 08/2019
under section 302/307 Ranbir Penal Code, 7/27 of the Arms Act,
1959 and section 19 of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act,
1967 was registered with the Police Station Karalgund. Same error
of date by showing FIR no.08/2019 with respect to incident of
01.03.2009 came to be typed by the District Magistrate Kupwara in
the grounds of detention to the extent of not even mentioning the
date of FIR no. 08/2019 because the date of registration of said FIR
was not there in the dossier and so is the case with the grounds of
detention. This is the best exhibit of the mechanical application of
mind on the part of the District Magistrate Kupwara in issuing the
preventive detention order against the petitioner as if the matter of
depriving a person of his personal liberty, which being a
fundamental right under the Constitution of India, is a matter of
pleasure for the authority seeking preventive detention and the
authority granting the said preventive detention. Discretion to issue
non bailable warrant instead of bailable warrant against an
accused in a criminal case would have much better quality of
application of mind on the part of a magistrate issuing the process
than the District Magistrate Kupwara in issuing the preventive
detention order in reference against the petitioner.
8)      Thus, this Court finds the detention order of the petitioner
ex-facie bad in the eyes of law and as such is held illegal deserving
to be quashed. The impugned detention order no. 17-DMK/PSA of
2022 dated 24.06.2022 of the petitioner passed by the District
Magistrate Kupwara and its consequential confirmation is hereby
quashed and the petitioner be restored to his personal liberty with
immediate effect in the context of his detention by reference to the
detention order hereby quashed.
