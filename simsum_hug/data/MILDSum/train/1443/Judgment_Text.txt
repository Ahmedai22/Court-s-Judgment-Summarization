PRAYER : Writ Petition filed Under Article 226 of the Constitution of
India, to issue a Writ of Mandamus, directing the Second and Third
Respondents to waive off fully the cash handling charges collected from the
stamp vendors in pursuant to the official letter RC. No. 12849/2016/L2
dated 28.03.2016 issued by the First Respondent and consequently forbear
the Third Respondent from collecting any cash handling charges forthwith
from the Petitioner for purchase of stamp papers.
W.P. Nos. 34347, 24076 and 34348 of 2016
The writs on hand have been instituted for direction to direct the
Second and Third Respondents to waive off fully cash handling charges
collected from the stamp vendors, pursuant to the Official Letter in R.C.
No.12849/2016/L2 dated 28.03.2016 issued by the First Respondent and
consequently, forbear the Third Respondent from collecting any cash
handling charges forthwith from the Petitioners for purchase of stamp
papers.
2. The Petitioners are in the business of vending stamp papers since
1988 and holding valid licenses. The grievance of the Writ Petitioners is
that since January, 2015, the Second and Third Respondents are illegally
demanding the Petitioners to deposit Rs.15/- for every bundle of currency,
i.e., bundle containing 100 notes by remitting in the name of account as
W.P. Nos. 34347, 24076 and 34348 of 2016
“Commission Account”, for which no receipts or payment challans are
issued. The First Respondent viz., the Director, Treasuries and Accounts
Department, Chennai vide letter dated 28.03.2016 addressed the Second
Respondent viz., the General Manager, State Bank of India, Local Head
Office, College Road, Nungambakkam, Chennai to waive off the cash
handling charges collected from the stamp vendors, as the Government is
paying separately to the banks. The Petitioners are forced to pay Rs. 150 /-
to Rs. 200/- as cash handling charges, which have severe financial impact
on the meager commission earned every day.
3. Learned Counsel appearing on behalf of the Petitioners/ Stamp
Vendors submits that the Second and Third Respondents /State Bank of
India, by misinterpreting the Master Circular issued by the Reserve Bank of
India, collecting cash handling charges from the Petitioners, who all are
depositing money through Treasury Challans into the Government account.
4. It is contended that the stamp vendors are depositing money
through Treasury Challans in the Government account, more specifically, on
behalf of the Government. Thus, the transaction cannot be treated as 'private
W.P. Nos. 34347, 24076 and 34348 of 2016
transaction' and the money is being deposited in Government accounts
through Treasury Challans for the purpose of purchase of stamps.
5. This being the nature of transaction, there is no valid reason
whatsoever for the purpose of collecting cash handing charges from the
stamp vendors, as they are unconnected with the Government accounts and,
the deposit is made on behalf of the Government. This being the illegality
noticed by the Petitioners, due to the act of the State Bank of India, the
Petitioners are constrained to move the present Writ Petitions.
6. Learned Counsel appearing on behalf of the Second and Third
Respondents /State Bank of India objected the contentions by stating that
cash handling charges are collected based on the Master Circular issued by
the Reserve Bank of India. Such cash handling charges are being collected
for every such transaction and therefore, there is no irregularity as such in
respect of such collections made pursuant to the direction of the Reserve
Bank of India.
W.P. Nos. 34347, 24076 and 34348 of 2016
7. Learned Counsel appearing on behalf of the Second and Third
Respondents contended that the Master Circulars dated 01.07.2014 and
01.04.2021 permit the State Bank of India to collect cash handling charges
and whenever the cash is deposited, the authorities of the State Bank of
India are empowered to collect those cash handling charges.
8. Learned counsel appearing for the Second and Third Respondents
clarified by saying that the Master Circulars dated 01.07.2014 and
01.04.2021 are permitting to collect agency commission and cash handling
charges. Thus, there is no infirmity in respect of such collection of cash
handling charges by the Second and Third Respondents /State Bank of
9. It is pertinent to note that the complaint submitted by the
Petitioners to the Director /Commissioner of Treasuries and Accounts was
considered by the Commissioner, who in turn sent a letter dated 28.03.2016
to the General Manager, State Bank of India, Local Head Office,
Nungambakkam, Chennai, which reads as follows:-
''As the stamp vendors are remitting cash to purchase
W.P. Nos. 34347, 24076 and 34348 of 2016
Stamps from Treasuries by remitting money into State
Government Accounts and not for inidividual current /savings
Bank Accounts, it is requested that this cash handling charges
should be waived off for this remittance. Further, it is pointed
out that, for every Government transaction charges are beind
paid separately to the banks by the Government and
therefore, the cash handling charges collected from stamp
vendors may fully be waived off. The Stamp Vendors may also
be exempted from the cash handling charges.''
In respect of the letter sent by the Director /Commissioner of Treasuries and
Accounts, Government of Tamil Nadu, Learned Counsel appearing on
behalf of the Second and Third Respondents /State Bank of India contended
that those circulars are not binding on the State Bank of India. The Director
/Commissioner of Treasuries and Accounts has no authority to prevent the
State Bank of India from collecting any cash handling charges and
therefore, the said clarificatory letter cannot be relied upon for the purpose
of considering the request of the Petitioners for non-collection of cash
handling charges.
W.P. Nos. 34347, 24076 and 34348 of 2016
10. Learned Counsel appearing on behalf of the Second and Third
Respondents /State Bank of India reiterated that they are bound by the
Master Circulars issued by the Reserve Bank of India and they are not
bound by the orders passed by the Government of Tamil Nadu.
11. In view of the stand taken by the State Bank of India, this Court
suo motu impleaded the Principal Secretary to Government, Finance
Department, Secretariat to clarify the position with reference to the stand
taken by the State Bank of India, as the Government of Tamil Nadu is the
account holder in the State Bank of India.
12. Pursuant to the order to implead the Principal Secretary to
Government, Finance Department, Fort St. George, Chennai, counter-
affidavits are filed by the impleaded Fourth Respondent.
13. The facts and circumstances were elaborately looked into by the
Finance Department, as the Government of Tamil Nadu is an account holder
in the State Bank of India and Government accounts are operated with
privileges considering various factors and baking regulations. Paragraph
W.P. Nos. 34347, 24076 and 34348 of 2016
Nos. 6 and 7 of the counter affidavits filed by the Fourth Respondent
Finance Department are relevant, which are extracted as follows:-
“6.It is also submitted that the respondent Bank, in its
counter affidavit in W.P. No. 24076 of 2016 has stated that in
revised     circular   no.  NBG/BOD-SC/71/2015-16              dated
31.12.2015, issued by the Banking operations Department,
State Bank of India, cooperate centre, Mumbai, various
charges have been regulated and the cash handling charge is
one among them. But a copy of the said circular is not made
available in the typed set of papers filed by the Second and
Third Respondents hereing. Hence, the respondent Bank is
put to strict proof of the said averments. Further, in the said
counter affidavit there is no whisper about the permissibility
of collecting cash handling charges in respect of deposits
made into Government Accounts by way of challans. Hence,
the Respondent Bank has failed to establish that it is
permissible to collect cash handling charges in respect of
money deposited by the petitioner stamp vendors into
Government Account through Challans.
It is also submitted that during the revision of service
charges by the Head Office of the State Bank of India, w.e.f.,
01.10.2019, the rates of cash handling charges for various
kinds of Accounts such as Savings Accounts /Current Account
etc., have been prescribed. (Copy enclosed) But, in the said
W.P. Nos. 34347, 24076 and 34348 of 2016
Circular, no cash handling charges have been explicitly
provided for Government receipts which shows that collection
of cash handling charges for deposit of cash into Government
Account through challans has not at all been permitted by the
State Bank of India itself. It is therefore submitted that such
cash handling charges have been collected by mistake by
misinterpretation of the Circular of the Head Office of the
State Bank of India and such collection being made by the
Respondent Bank herein is without any authority.
In this regard, it is pertinent to point that, since the Third
Respondent Bank itself is not clear about the permissibility of
collecting cash handling charges from the petitioner, it has
sought for a clarification from the AGM, SBI, Government,
Banking Unit, Local Head Office, Chennai as to whether cash
handling charges is applicable for stamp vendors since they
are remitting money into State Government Account and not
for their individual current /Savings Bank Account. The
nature of the reply received is not known and the Second and
Third Respondents shall be directed to produce the same
before this Hon'ble Court if any reply was received. It is
therefore submitted that the collection of cash handling
charges from the Stamp Vendors by the Third Respondent
bank while depositing money into Government Account
through Treasury challans is impermissible and the Third
Respondent Bank is put to strict proof of the same.
W.P. Nos. 34347, 24076 and 34348 of 2016
7. It is also submitted that as per the Master Circular RBI/
2021-22/07, DGBA, GBD No.S-2/ 31.12.2010/2021-22, dated
01.04.2021 (available in pages 16-28 of the typed set of
papers filed by the Second and Third Respondents in W.P.
No. 24076 of 2016) issued by the RBI on 'Payment of Agency
Commission for conduct of Government Business by Agency
Banks', transactions relating to Government Business, i.e.,
Revenue receipt and payments on behalf of the State
Governments undertaken by Agency Banks are eligible for
agency commission which is paid by the RBI. That being so,
being a Government business in the nature of payment of
money into Government Account, the Third Respondent Bank
should have been paid agency commission by the RBI for the
deposit of money by the Stamp Vendors in Government
Account through Treasury Challans for buying Stamp papers
from the Treasury. That, being so, when the Third Respondent
Bank has already been paid agency commission for the above
transaction, it is not justifiable on their part to collect cash
handling charges from the Stamp Vendors that too when it is
not specifically authorised to collect it either by the RBI or by
the Head Office of the State Bank of India.
In this regard, it is also submitted that, for every Government
transaction Agency commission claim for every quarter is
prepared by each Agency Bank which is authenticated by the
Treasury Officials for claiming the amount by Bank Authority
W.P. Nos. 34347, 24076 and 34348 of 2016
from competent authority. Therefore, the cash handling
charges collected from stamp vendors is not legally
permissibility and such collection of cash handling charges
from the Stamp Vendors is liable to the set aside as illegal
and without any authority.”
14. The Government has categorically stated that no cash handling
charges have been explicitly provided for Government receipts, which
shows that collection of cash handling charges for deposit of cash into
Government Account through Treasury Challans has not at all been
permitted by the State Bank of India itself. It is, therefore, cash handling
charges have been collected by mistake or by misinterpretation of the
Circular of the Head Office of the State Bank of India and such collection
being made by the Respondent Bank herein is without any authority.
15. The Fourth Respondent has further stated that the Third
Respondent itself is not clear about the permissibility of collecting cash
handling charges from the Petitioners, the clarifications sought for from the
Assistant General Manager, State Bank of India, Government, Banking unit,
Local Head Office, Chennai has also not been properly replied and the
W.P. Nos. 34347, 24076 and 34348 of 2016
Government has stated that there is no reply for such clarification from the
16. Under these circumstances, such collection of cash handling
charges from the Stamp Vendors by the Third Respondent /Bank, while
depositing money into Government Account through Treasury Challans is
impermissible.
17. Perusal of the Master Circulars relied on by the Second and Third
Respondents /State Bank of India dated 01.07.2014 and 01.04.2021 reveals
that the Second and Third Respondents are unable to establish that there is a
direction / instruction / permission granted by the Reserve Bank of India to
collect such cash handling charges on Government transactions. In the
absence of any such specific direction or instructions from the Reserve
Bank of India, the State Bank of India is not entitled to collect any cash
handling charges from stamp vendors. Any such collection must be strictly
in accordance with the Reserve Bank of India Regulations or in accordance
with the Banking Regulations. Such collection of cash handling charges
cannot be assumed or collected based on certain inferences. Any such
W.P. Nos. 34347, 24076 and 34348 of 2016
collection must be made only, if there is a specific direction permitting the
bank to collect cash handling charges.
18. However, the Second and Third Respondents /State Bank of India
are unable to establish that there is a specific direction from the Reserve
Bank of India for collecting such cash handling charges from the stamp
vendors, while depositing money through Treasury challans.
19. During the course of hearing and considering the issues raised,
this        Court   has  noticed   that   in  the    Counter       Affidavits      filed,
Mr.K.Lakshminarayanan, Son of S.Krishnamurthy; P.Prince Sounderraj,
S/o.P.Ponnusamy; and G.Inbarasu, S/o.V.Ganapathy, have stated that “It is
always open for the Petitioners to approach any other bank and continue
their banking operations”.
20.The above statement in the counter filed by the State Bank of India
is to be construed as an irresponsible statement. The State Bank of India is a
public sector and the authorities are the public servants. The petitioners are
depositing cash in the Government accounts on behalf of the Government
W.P. Nos. 34347, 24076 and 34348 of 2016
through Treasury Challans issued to them. The Statement portrays the
administrative arrogance on the part of the authorities in exercise of their
powers and the tenor of the statement is a threat to the public
administration, as the stamp vendors have no option but to deposit money
only in Government accounts at SBI Branches. Thus, this Court is inclined
to direct the second respondent/the Assistant General Manager, State Bank
of India, to initiate appropriate disciplinary proceedings by conducting an
enquiry and find out on what circumstances such statements are allowed to
be made in the counter affidavit filed before the High Court.
of India, Treasury Branch, Chennai-1, Mrs.V.Sarada, Chief Manager, State
Bank of India, Chennai Main Branch, and Mr.G.Inbarasu, Chief Manager,
State Bank of India, Arcot Branch, are present before this Court, along with
their counsel.
22. The learned counsel appearing on behalf of the respondent-State
Bank of India filed the additional affidavits of the aforesaid officials,
regretting the statement made in the original counter affidavit.
W.P. Nos. 34347, 24076 and 34348 of 2016
23. The 2nd respondent, General Manager of State Bank of India, has
to sensitize the officials in this regard to develop good conduct with the
customers and the citizens, who all are approaching the Bank for
transactions.          These employees/officials must be reminded off that, from
and out of the transactions through the customers and citizens, the salary to
these employees are paid.             Thus, they are expected to maintain good
conduct always and honour the rights of the persons approaching the Bank.
24. It is brought to the notice of this Court by the Learned Counsel for
the Petitioners that at the time of admitting the present Writ Petitions,
interim orders were passed by this Court not to collect cash handling
charges from the stamp vendors. However, such cash handling charges were
collected.
25. Learned Counsel appearing on behalf of the Second and Third
Respondents contended that in the event of producing any such proof, the
bank will be in a position to respond. Thus, the Petitioners are at liberty to
submit proof to establish that such cash handling charges were collected,
that too when the interim order passed by this Court was in force. If such
W.P. Nos. 34347, 24076 and 34348 of 2016
proof is produced, the Second and Third Respondents are bound to return
the money, failing which the Petitioners are at liberty to approach this Court
by filing appropriate application.
26. Another observation to be made by this Court is that the
respondents 2 and 3 argued that they need not respond to the letter sent by
the Commissioner of Treasuries and Accounts, Government of Tamil Nadu.
No doubt, the Commissioner of Treasuries and Accounts may not have
administrative control over the State Bank of India, but he is an officer of
the State performing solemn functions and, whenever such letters are
communicated by the Governmental authorities, the State Bank of India, is
bound to respond in an appropriate manner and in the event of any doubt in
respect of such information given by the Commissioner of Treasuries and
Accounts, they are at liberty to approach the Government for further
clarification, so also the Reserve Bank of India. Contrarily, they are not
expected to neglect such letters or to proceed under the pretext that they
need not respond to such letters. This nature of conduct is also to be
construed as irresponsible on the part of the State Bank of India authorities.
Any such letters from any responsible authorities of the State, who all are
W.P. Nos. 34347, 24076 and 34348 of 2016
performing solemn functions of the State must be responded in the manner
known to law and due courtesy is to be extended to such officials, while
they are performing their administrative/public duties. The respondents 2
and 3 are expected to initiate appropriate action in this regard to sensitize
the Bank officials.
27. As far as the reliefs sought for in the present Writ Petitions are
concerned, the Director/ Commissioner of Treasuries and Accounts long
back clarified that the collection of cash handling charges is not permissible.
The Principal Secretary to Government, Finance, Government of Tamil
Nadu has also filed a counter statement stating that cash handling charges
are collected mistakenly by misinterpretation of the circular of the Head
Office of the State Bank of India. On the verification of the Master Circulars
relied on by the State Bank of India, issued by the Reserve Bank of India on
01.07.2014 and 01.04.2021, it is seen that both circulars are related to
agency commission and there is no specific direction or instruction from the
Reserve Bank India. Thus, it is not proper on the part of State Bank of India
to collect cash handling charges from the stamp vendors. Accordingly, the
Second and Third Respondents have failed to establish that they have the
W.P. Nos. 34347, 24076 and 34348 of 2016
authority to collect cash handling charges from the stamp vendors, who all
are depositing money through Treasury Challans for purchase of stamps.
28. In view of the facts and circumstances, this Court is inclined to
(1) The Collection of cash handling charges from the
stamp vendors/petitioners by the 2nd and 3rd respondents are
declared as illegal and without any authority. Accordingly, the
respondents 2 and 3 are directed, not to collect any cash
handling charges from the stamp vendors, while depositing
cash in Government accounts through Treasury Challans in any
of the branches of the State Bank of India.
(2) The 2nd respondent is directed to communicate this
order along with necessary circular/instructions to all the
branches of the State Bank of India and upload the same in the
official website of State Bank of India, enabling the citizens to
know their rights.
W.P. Nos. 34347, 24076 and 34348 of 2016
29. With the above directions, these Writ Petitions are allowed. No
costs. Consequently, connected miscellaneous Petitions are closed.
