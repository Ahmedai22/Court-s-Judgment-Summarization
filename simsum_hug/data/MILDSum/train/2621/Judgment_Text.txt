1.  Leave granted.      This appeal has been preferred
by  the   Management    against         the  judgement   dated
11.02.2016 in the L.P.A. No.334/2008 whereby, the
Division Bench of the High Court of Jharkhand had
set aside the order passed by the learned Single
Judge   and   restored    the      Award    dated  28.09.2005
passed    by    the   Central         Government    Industrial
Tribunal     No.1   Dhanbad        whereby,    the    workmen-
respondents were directed to be reinstated with 50%
back wages.
2.   We have heard Mr. Anupam Lal Das, learned Sr.
counsel   appearing     for        the    Management.   The
respondent-Union who were espousing the interest of
the  discharged  workmen,        is   represented    by Ms.
Anisha Upadhyay, the learned counsel.
3.  The appellants are the Management of Bhalgora
Area of M/s Bharat Coking Coal Limited (‘BCCL’ for
short), a Central Government Undertaking within the
meaning of Section 617 of the Companies Act, 1956.
By virtue of their status, the BCCL is required to
process   their   recruitment,         by    notifying  the
vacancies   and   requisitioning          names   from  the
jurisdictional   Employment         Exchange,    under  the
provisions of the Employment Exchange (Compulsory
Notification of Vacancies) Act, 1959 (for short,
4.  In 1986, the BCCL decided to recruit Scheduled
Castes/Scheduled Tribes candidates in vacancies of
miners/loaders.    Accordingly,           the  Management   of
BCCL made requisition from the Employment Exchange
on  the  basis  whereof,        list     of   eligible   SC/ST
candidates  for  appointment          was  prepared.     As  a
matter of fact, such list did not contain the names
of any of the 38 workmen whose case is represented
by the respondent-Trade Union.             The allegation is
that those 38 job aspirants, in connivance with a
Dealing Assistant and a Personnel Manager of the
Bhalgora   Area   of      BCCL,        dishonestly     secured
appointments. When such fraudulent appointments was
detected, disciplinary proceedings were drawn up
against  the concerned       Dealing Assistant       and the
Personnel Manager and eventually both were removed
from service.   Parallelly, Charge Memo was issued
against the concerned miners/loaders and following
the adverse finding in the departmental inquiry,
the  beneficiaries   of     the      fraudulent   appointment
process were terminated from service.
5.  The case of the 38 workmen was taken up by the
respondent-Trade Union and in the Reference Case
No.98 of 1994, the Central Government Industrial
Tribunal No.1 Dhanbad (hereinafter referred to as,
‘the   Tribunal’   for     short)       concluded     that   the
Management   failed to      substantiate the         charge of
manipulated appointment as the concerned witness
i.e. the dealing clerk Jitendra Kumar Adeshra and
the Personnel Manager PM Prasad, were not examined
to prove the charge of unmerited appointment being
secured by the workmen, in connivance with the said
two   employees   of    the     Organization.          For   the
perceived   failure    of    the      Management    to  justify
their    action,     the      termination        orders     were
interdicted    by  the    Tribunal        and   the   concerned
workmen were directed to be reinstated with 50%
back wages.
6.   Aggrieved    by    the      Tribunal’s      Award     dated
28.09.2005,    the    Management         filed    the   W.P.(L)
No.1916 of 2006, challenging the finding and the
direction   of  the   Tribunal.          The   learned   Single
Judge noted that the specific case of some of the
workmen in their reply to the charge-memo was that
their   names  figured    in     the   Employment    Exchange
sponsored list, sent from Bhowra area to Bhalgora
area and in this way, they tried to show that they
were   legally   appointed.        But   in   their   Written
Statement   filed  before      the   Tribunal    in  a   clear
departure from their earlier stand, the workmen on
the    second    occasion        contended      that     their
appointments were made by the General Manager of
the Bhalgora area independently and this was not
related   to  the     Employment        Exchange    sponsored
panel,   prepared  by   the      Bhalgora    area   in   1986.
While analyzing such contradictory stand, the Writ
Court found that the lists sent from the Employment
Exchange to the Bhowra area (marked as Exbt.M-3 to
M-3/3)   and  the  list     sent     from   Bhowra   area   to
Bhalgora area (marked as Exbt.M-4/1 to M-4/4) were
available on record before the Tribunal. The names
in the lists were verified and it was found that
the  litigating   workmen      did   not   figure   in   those
lists.   The disciplinary action taken against the
Dealing   Clerk  and  the     Personnel     Manager    on  the
charge of facilitating fraudulent employment for
the  38  workmen,    was    also      noted   by the   learned
Judge.     In   consequence,         having   regard   to   the
materials   on  record,     it     was   concluded   that   the
Tribunal erroneously answered the reference against
the Management.     It was accordingly held that the
reinstatement order for the workmen, was unmerited.
Adverting to the contradictory stand of the workmen
to  lend   legitimacy      to      their    appointment,    the
Court’s    conclusion        was       that    the    Tribunal
misdirected    itself   in      allowing     the   workmen   to
depart from the earlier stand on the premises that
the workmen were appointed by the General Manager
independently and without reference to the lists
sent from the Employment Exchange. On this aspect,
it must be observed that the legitimacy of the
appointment cannot be tested on the touchstone of
two contradictory projections.              If either one is
accepted, the next one has to be discarded.              Thus,
it is reasonable to hold that the appointees failed
to   establish     that       their      appointments      were
legitimate   and should       therefore, be       immune from
7.   It is also relevant to record herein that the
Management witness Ram Janam Sigh (M-1), who was
the Deputy Personnel Manager in Bhowra area at the
relevant time, while proving the Exbt. M-3 series
and M-4 series had pointedly testified that the M-3
series   Exbts.   were   the      lists     received   from   the
Employment Exchange from which, few were appointed
in  Bhowra   area   and    the     remaining     persons   whose
names find place in M-4 series Exbts, were then
appointed in the Bhalgora area.             From the materials
the Court formulated that the main question to be
examined   is   whether      the      names   of   the   workmen
figured in the Employment Exchange sponsored lists.
It was then found that they did not.                The learned
Judge   accordingly    held      that     the   Management    has
proved that it is a case of unmerited appointment
and   the   workmen    were      the     beneficiaries     of   a
fraudulent process.
8.   The Court was also of the view that the burden
was on the Union to establish that the workmen were
lawfully   appointed    but      since     such  onus   was   not
discharged  by  the   Union,        the  Writ  Petition  was
allowed in favour of the Management, and against
the workmen.
9.  Aggrieved   by   the      decision      of  the  learned
Single Judge, the Union filed the LPA No.334 of
2008 before the High Court.          The Division Bench, on
the perceived failure of the Management to adduce
material to justify the termination orders, decided
in favour of the appointees.              In this way, the
fraudulent   process     through        which  the   workmen
secured appointment was not given due weightage by
the Division Bench.    The fact that the names of the
workmen did not figure in the lists sponsored by
the Employment Exchange and as a corollary, the
appointments would be contrary to the prescription
in the 1959 Act, was also significantly overlooked,
in the LPA proceeding.            The names of the workmen
did not as a matter of fact, figure in the Exbt.M-3
series and Exbt.M-4 series and yet, without regard
for this most relevant aspect, the Division Bench
erroneously concluded that the Management failed to
adduce     requisite       evidence         on     un-merited
appointment, secured by the workmen.
10. At this stage it would be relevant to state
that the records of the domestic enquiry leading to
the termination orders were made available by the
Management to the Tribunal.           All the exhibits from
page 1 to page 454, including the approval of the
General Manager for the discharge of the workmen on
the  recommendation    of     the    Project   Officer,    the
Exbt.M-2 chargesheets, as also the domestic enquiry
proceedings were all presented to the Tribunal by
the  Management.   To    claim       legitimacy    for   their
appointment, few of the workmen in their response
to the chargesheet as noted earlier, claimed that
their names figured in the lists sponsored by the
Employment    Exchange.        But     in    their     Written
Statement,   the  workmen       pleaded     differently    and
claimed that they were appointed by the General
Manager  of the   Bhalgora area,          independently and
without reference to the lists from the Employment
Exchange. Such diametrically opposite stand of the
workmen    on    how     they        secured     appointment,
(predicated on two versions which naturally can not
stand together), should have in our view, persuaded
both the Tribunal as also the Division Bench to
answer the reference in favour of the Management.
11. In    the    present       case,      the    Management’s
consistent stand has been that it was a case of
fraudulent    appointment      in     connivance    with  the
Dealing Assistant and Personnel Manager, who faced
disciplinary    action     for       facilitating    wrongful
appointment.    It   is    also       noteworthy    that  the
appellant as a Government Undertaking, is under a
statutory obligation under the 1959 Act, to make
appointments only through the Employment Exchange.
But this was not done in this case for the 38
litigating workmen.      The names of the respondent-
workmen, as earlier noted, did not figure in either
of  the   two   lists   relatable        to  the   Employment
Exchange.    Moreover, the workmen, as can be seen,
failed  to   discharge    their       burden  and   took  the
contradictory   stand    in     a     desperate   attempt   to
convey legitimacy to their appointment.
12. We must also be conscious of the fact that
departmental  action    was      taken    by   the  appellant
against  the   errant     Personnel        Manager   and   the
Dealing   Assistant,      for        their    misconduct    in
facilitating   unmerited        appointment      to   the   38
workmen  through   a   fraudulent         process.   In   this
regard, usefully it can be noted that the Dealing
Assistant and the Personnel Manager were dismissed
for their misconduct. For the record, the Dealing
Assistant’s dismissal was upheld by the Tribunal on
13.06.2000 in the Reference No.5/97. The dismissal
order against the Personnel Manager was although
interfered by the High Court but on appeal by the
Management, the case was remanded to the High Court
for fresh adjudication. Since then, the Personnel
Manager  has  reached     the      age   of  superannuation.
These would suggest that the appellant pursued the
issue of unmerited appointment, both against the
facilitators and also the beneficiaries.
13. In the above perspective, the reference in our
opinion, was erroneously answered by the Tribunal,
against the Management. In the process, the steps
taken by the Management to undo the wrong done by
the   two    delinquent      employees     to   facilitate
unmerited appointment, was undeservedly interdicted
by the Tribunal.
14. The learned Single Judge should not have been
overruled by the impugned judgment by ignoring the
key fact that the appointees did not figure in
either    of    the    lists,        sponsored    by    the
jurisdictional Employment Exchange and that they
were beneficiaries of a fraudulent process.          Enough
materials were presented to the Tribunal to justify
the action against the illegally appointed workmen,
and as such the appellants cannot be made to suffer
the  consequence   of  the      misconduct   of  their  two
errant employees against whom, disciplinary actions
were   taken  by  the    Management.        Moreover,   the
contradictory   stand of       the workmen    at different
stage would suggest that they were conscious and
aware   of being     appointed through           a non-bonafide
process.       In   any   case,        the   appointments   were
contrary to the requirements of the 1959 Act.
15. In Union of India Vs. M.Bhaskaran1, on similar
facts    of   fraudulent       appointment,        Justice  S.B.
Majumdar    writing    for      a    Division     Bench  rightly
“6. …the concerned railway employees,
respondents      herein          have     admittedly
snatched employment in Railway service,
may be of a casual nature, by relying
upon forged or bogus casual labourer
cards. The unauthenticity of the service
cards on the basis of which they got
employment is clearly established on
record of the departmental enquiry held
against      the       concerned          employees.
Consequently, it has to be held that
misrepresentation and fraud perpetrated
on the appellant employer while getting
employed in Railway service and had
Snatched such employment which would not
have been made available to them if they
were not armed with such bogus and forged
labourer cards. It was clearly a case of
fraud on the appellant-employer. If once
such fraud is detected, the appointment
orders themselves which were found to be
tainted and vitiated by fraud and acts of
cheating on the part of employees, were
liable to be recalled and were at least
voidable at the option of the employer
concerned. This is precisely what has
happened in the present case. Once the
fraud of the respondents in getting such
employment was detected the respondents
were proceeded against in departmental
enquiries and were called upon to have
their say and thereafter have been
removed from service. Such orders of
removal would amount to recalling of
fraudulently        obtained           erroneous
appointment orders which were avoided by
the employer- appellant after following
the due procedure of law and complying
with the principles of natural justice.”
16. We also endorse the opinion of Justice D.Y.
Chandrachud, writing for a three judges’ Bench in
Chairman and Managing Director, Food Corporation
where the Court has noted the responsibility of
Courts    to   guard against        fraudulent   employment,
especially    when such    appointment is       obtained by
perpetuating fraud upon the authorities,
“4. …Public employment is a significant
source of social mobility. Access to
education opens the doors to secure
futures. As a matter of principle, in the
exercise     of       its         constitutional
jurisdiction,   the       court     must   weigh
against an interpretation which will
protect unjust claims over the just,
fraud over legality and expediency over
principle. As the nation evolves, the
constitutional principle, enforces the
rule of law and reaffirms the belief that
claims based upon fraud, expediency and
subterfuge will not be recognised. Once
these parameters are established with a
clear judicial formulation individual
cases should pose no problem. Usurpation
of constitutional benefits by persons who
are not entitled to them must be answered
by the court in the only way permissible
for an institution which has to uphold
the rule of law. Unless the courts were
to do so, it would leave open a path of
incentives for claims based on fraud to
survive legal gambits and the creativity
of the disingenuous.”
17. Fraudulent practice to gain public employment
cannot be countenanced to be permitted by a Court
of law. The workmen here, having hoodwinked the
Government Undertaking in a fraudulent manner, must
be prevented from enjoying the fruits of their ill-
gotten   advantage.     The        sanctity   of    public
employment, as a measure of social welfare and a
significant   source    of     social      mobility,   must  be
protected   against   such      fraudulent      process   which
manipulates   and   corrupts        the    selection   process.
Employment    schemes    floated         by   the   State   for
targeted   groups,   can    absorb       a  finite   number  of
workmen. To abuse the legitimate process therefore
would mean deprivation of employment benefits to
rightful beneficiaries. The Courts as sentinel of
justice must strive to ensure that such employment
programmes    are    not     manipulated        by    deceitful
middlemen, thereby setting up a parallel mechanism
of    Faustian    Bargain.         Often,      desperate    job
aspirants’ resort to such measures to compete for
limited vacancies, but this Court cannot condone
false    projections     so      as      to   circumvent    the
statutorily prescribed procedure for appointments.
Such illegal practices must be interdicted by the
18. For the aforesaid reasons, the reversal of the
well-reasoned order of the learned Single Judge is
found to be unjustified.              The appeal accordingly
stands allowed by setting aside the LPA judgment
and restoring the decision of the learned Single
Judge. It is ordered accordingly. The parties to
bear their own cost.
