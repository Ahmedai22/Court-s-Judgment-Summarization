Revision Application. Based on those income tax returns, he
submitted that the interim maintenance awarded to the wife
and daughters are on higher side.                   However, from the
impugned order, it is clear that despite the petitioner –
husband has filed his written reply, he did not produce any
document showing his earning, more particularly, with regard
to his income.          However, the respondent – wife produced
several documents vide list Mark 19/1 to 19/91, which includes
photographs of two luxury Cars, Fortuner as well as Maruti
Breeza Vitara as also copy of registration certificate for both
the high end cars.        As such, as alleged by the respondent –
wife, the petitioner – husband has to his credit several offences
and he has also remained in Central Jail for some time. Not
only that, he has 150 Rickshaws, which is given on rent and he
is charging per day Rs.250/- to Rs.300/- per Rickshaw. He is
also dealing in the business as broker in Motor Vehicles and
obtains hefty brokerage.          He is also doing the business of
finance in the name of Umiya Automobiles and is also working
in RTO as an agent and thereby also he earns. As such, the
petitioner – husband is also having one bungalow, which costs
approximately Rs.1 Crore and a flat at Naroda, which is costing
Rs.40 to Rs.50 lakhs.            He also owns a shop, which is
approximately valued at Rs.3,50,00,000/-.                  In short, the
petitioner      –    husband  is   having     sufficient   earnings          and
properties for which the petitioner – husband has not produced
single documents except bare denial with regard to valuation
of the immovable property referred to by him, if he has no
such immovable property, he would have declared so on oath
before the Court, which he failed to do. Not only that, when
high end luxurious cars owned by him cannot be disputed,

prima facie valuation put forth by the wife, in absence of denial
thereto without any material, on oath by the petitioner –
husband can be taken as a base to determine interim
[3.0]           The income tax returns attempted to be produced
by the petitioner – husband before this Court for the
Assessment year 2021-22 and 2022-23 are subsequent to the
filing of the application of maintenance, and therefore, it
cannot be considered. Even if it is to be considered here, at
this stage without production thereof before the trial Court, the
interim maintenance cannot be determined based on such
income tax return.
[4.0]           The allegation against the respondent – wife that
she leads adulterous life is required to be proved by leading
cogent evidence before the Court and production of mere
photographs, that too, before this Court will not suffice to
assert that she leads adulterous life, and therefore, she is not
entitled for maintenance.        So far as interim maintenance is
concerned,         considering the    earning  of  the     petitioner          –
husband, as stated hereinabove at the rate of Rs.30,000/- in
all per month, is much on a lower side and appears to be
reasonable to be awarded at interim stage, and therefore, I see
no reason to interfere with the order impugned and it is hereby
