These applications have been filed on behalf of
the owners/dealers of BS-IV vehicles where the sales
of the vehicles have been registered on the e-Vahan
portal   and   temporary/permanent     registration    was
granted to these vehicles prior to 31.03.2020.          By
an Order dated 13.08.2020, this Court took notice of
the fact that a large number of sales have been made
and   uploaded   on    e-Vahan    portal   and   temporary
registrations were made during the lock-down period.
By the said order this Court reiterated the order
passed on 27.3.2020 that no registration of BS-IV
vehicles can be done in Delhi and NCR.        Registration
of  vehicles   could   be   done  for  the   rest  of  the
country provided, the sales are uploaded on e-Vahan
Mr. A.D.N. Rao, learned Amicus Curiae relied
upon an order passed by this Court on 02.11.2020 by
which individual applications were permitted to be
withdrawn to enable the applicants to approach the
respective High Courts for the relief relating to
registration of their vehicles.
We have perused an Order passed by this Court
on 15.06.2020, in which it was made clear that no
registration    of   any  BS-IV   vehicles   can  be   made
without  the    permission    of  this  Court.      Learned
counsel appearing for the applicants submitted that
relegation   of   the   applicants   to  the  High   Courts
would not serve any purpose in view of the Order
Sales of the vehicles which have been uploaded
on   e-Vahan     portal    before   31.03.2020     can   be
registered  by    the  concerned   transport   authorities
provided  that    the  temporary/permanent    registration
was   granted     before    the   cut   off   date,    i.e.
31.03.2020.   The concerned transport authorities are
directed  to    carefully    scrutinize   the  records   to
ensure that the sales are genuine and have taken
place prior to 31.03.2020.
Interlocutory Applicantions stand disposed of.
These    applications       are    filed     seeking    a
direction to the concerned authorities of the State
of Manipur to register BS-IV vehicles sold before
31.03.2020   but  their     registrations     are   not   done.
Learned    counsel     appearing     for     the    applicants
submitted that the e-Vahan portal was started only
on  28.09.2020     and    one    of   the    conditions     for
registration of BS-IV vehicles which were sold prior
to 31.03.2020 is registration of sales on e-Vahan
portal.   Mr. Tushar Mehta, learned Solicitor General
submitted   that  the    permission    may   be  granted    for
registration of vehicles which were sold prior to
31.02.2020 as a one time measure.
The   concerned     authorities     of   the    transport
department of the State of Manipur are directed to
register  BS-IV   vehicles     which   were   sold    prior  to
31.03.2020   without    insisting     on   the   transactions
being   uploaded    on    e-Vahan    portal.        A   careful
scrutiny shall be done by the transport authorities
to find out that the transactions are genuine and
the sales were done prior to 31.03.2020.            This order
which is passed for the State of Manipur is in the
peculiar facts and circumstances of this case.
Interlocutory Applications stand disposed of.
These    applications      have    been    filed    for
registration   of   CNG  vehicles    which   are   not  being
registered by the transport authorities as a limited
interpretation    of   the   orders   of   this  Court.   The
order dated 18.09.2020 passed by this Court makes it
clear that in so far as CNG vehicles are concerned,
registration cannot be rejected as the emission from
such vehicles is within the limits.         In spite of the
Order dated 18.09.2020, in which the direction was
given in clear terms, the transport authorities have
unnecessarily   driven    these   applicants    to   approach
The   concerned       transport     authorities     are
directed to register the CNG vehicles.
Interlocutory        Applications       relating     to
registration of CNG vehicles stand disposed of.

Mr.   A.D.N.   Rao,   learned   Amicus   Curiae   has
brought to our notice that I.A. No. 121389/2019 filed
by the applicant in Civil Appeal No. 9783/2018 was
dismissed by this Court vide order dated 31.07.2020.
However,   by   order   dated   02.11.2020,    this   Court
allowed registration for similar vehicles pertaining
