Court allows High Courts to entertain writ petitions for BS-IV registration 


Modifying its earlier order, the Supreme Court has allowed High Courts to entertain writ petitions in relation to registration of BS-IV vehicles.
On Tuesday (November 30), the Court modified its previous order dated 15th June 2020 in which it was made clear that no registration of any BS-IV vehicles can be made without the permission of this Court.

The applicants submitted that the e-Vahan portal was started only on 28.09.2020 and one of the conditions for registration of BS-IV vehicles which were sold prior to 31.03.2020 is registration of sales on e-Vahan portal.
The Bench accordingly directed the concerned authorities of the transport department of the State of Manipur to do a careful scrutiny to find out that the transactions are genuine and the sales were done prior to 31.03.2020.

Background:
Supreme Court through its order on 13th August 2020 had granted a limited relief with respect to the registration of BS-IV vehicles, by allowing the registration of such vehicles which whose sale took place before March 31st but which could not be registered during lockdown in the month of March, 2020.
"There are still stated to be a large number of sales which have been made and uploaded on the E-Vaahan Portal, even temporary registrations were made. Their registration during the lockdown period could not be made. Hence, we allow registration of such vehicles only which could not be registered during lockdown in the month of March, 2020 and for no other reason", ordered a bench comprising Justices Arun Mishra, BR Gavai and Krishna Murari.
Furthermore, the Supreme Court had clarified that the Order for allowing registration applied to the entire country, but not Delhi-NCR. It had been categorically laid down that there will be absolutely no registration of BS-IV vehicles in Delhi-NCR post-March 31, 2020.
The Court elaborated that it had allowed registration of BS IV vehicles which had been sold in Indian before the nationwide lockdown, but could not be properly registered, as per procedure, due to the same.
It was made amply clear that this relaxation in registration was being allowed only because of the lockdown and must not to be construed in any other way or used for any other purpose, or for the registration of any other vehicle which was not done due to other reasons.
On July 31, the Court had recalled its March 27 order which allowed sale of 10% of unsold BS-IV vehicles for ten days after the lockdown, in areas except Delhi-NCR, after noting that the automobile dealers sold such vehicles during the lockdown in violation of the order.
Following the recall of the order, the bench headed by Justice Arun Mishra held that such vehicles sold during lockdown should not be treated as sold, and that the consideration received should be refunded to the purchasers. The Court also ordered that no such vehicle sold after March 31 should be registered.
"...the vehicles shall be treated to be with dealers as if they are not sold and consideration if any received shall be returned forthwith to the purchasers, no such vehicles sold after 31.03.2020 of BS-IV technology shall be registered", the bench had ordered then
In July, Supreme Court also took exception to FADA's request to allow dealers to return unsold inventory to the manufacturers so that they could be exported to other countries.
To put this in context, it must be noted that on March 27, the Top Court had permitted the sale of 10 per cent of unsold BS-IV vehicles to make up for six days lost due to the nationwide lockdown. However, on July 8, this Order was recalled on account of misuse of the Order, whereby more vehicles were sold than was permissible.
As this was brought to the Court's notice, the Order was recalled, following which registration was banned on July 31.
Bharat Stage (BS) emission norms are standards instituted by the government to regulate output of air pollutants from motor vehicles. The BS-IV norms have been enforced across the country since April 2017.Â  From April 1, 2020, BS-VI norms came into force.
