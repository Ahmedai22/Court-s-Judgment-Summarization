Analysis and reasons: .......................................................................................................... 9
1.     This writ petition is directed against the order dated 03.05.2019,
passed by the Central Administrative Tribunal (in short, the “Tribunal”) in
2.     The narrow but important issue which arises for consideration in this
writ petition is: whether an ad hoc employee is entitled to maternity benefit
for a period that spills beyond the tenure of the contract?
3.     This issue arises in the backdrop of the following broad facts :
3.1.   In and about 22.03.2016, the respondent was offered an appointment,
albeit, on an ad hoc basis as Senior Resident in the Department of
Dermatology in the petitioner-hospital. The offer made to the respondent
provided that the appointment would be for a period of 45/89 days or till a
regular incumbent joins the post, whichever is earlier.
3.2.    Based on the offer made, the respondent joined the petitioner-hospital
on 05.04.2016. A formal office order to this effect was taken out by the
petitioner-hospital on 24.05.2016. The first span of 89 days, thus, stretched
between 05.04.2016 and 02.07.2016.
3.3. Thereafter the respondent’s tenure was extended four times. Notably,
each time the respondent’s tenure lasted 89 days, and after a short break of
one day, the contract was renewed for another 89 days.
3.4. The respondent’s last tenure culminated on 27.06.2017. The record,
however, shows that on 17.04.2017, the respondent applied for emergency
maternity leave as her pregnancy had become complicated. Via this
communication, the petitioner averred that she was suffering from
antepartum haemorrhage and was advised bed rest by her gynaecologist. The
apprehension expressed in this letter was that the respondent may be
required to undergo an emergent caesarean section procedure, to facilitate
childbirth.
3.5.    In response to this request, the petitioner-hospital passed an office
order dated 23.05.2017, whereby the petitioner-hospital, instead of granting
maternity leave, terminated the services of the petitioner, albeit
retrospectively i.e., with effect from 24.04.2017.
4.      Aggrieved by the order dated 23.05.2017 passed by the petitioner-
hospital, the respondent filed an action in the Tribunal. This action was
numbered as O.A.No.1956/2017 and was disposed of by the Tribunal on
31.05.2017. In this O.A., the respondent had raised several grievances
including the fact that she had not been granted maternity leave and had not
been paid salary for April 2017. Besides this, the respondent had also
assailed the order dated 23.05.2017 whereby her services had been brought
to an end w.e.f. 24.04.2017.
4.1.    The Tribunal, after adverting, broadly, to the aforesaid grievances
disposed of the aforementioned O.A. with a direction that the respondent
will make a “comprehensive representation” to the petitioner-hospital; and
upon such a representation being made, the petitioner-hospital would
dispose of the same by passing a speaking order. Furthermore, the
petitioner-hospital was prodded to look into the matter “sympathetically”.
Succour was given by the Tribunal- inasmuch as a specific direction was
issued to the petitioner-hospital and Government of NCT of Delhi (GNCTD)
i.e., petitioner no.2, to release the unpaid salary of the respondent. For this
purpose, four weeks were granted to the petitioner-hospital.
4.2.    It appears that, pursuant to the directions of the Tribunal, the
respondent preferred a representation on 01.06.2017; an aspect which is not
refuted by the petitioner-hospital.
4.3.    The record shows that the respondent also sought the intervention of
the National Commission for Women (NCW); besides, as noticed above,
making a representation to the petitioner-hospital. It appears that, because
the matter was escalated by respondent and hearing was held before the
Member, NCW on 29.06.2017, the petitioner-hospital “revalidated” its
earlier order i.e., order dated 03.04.2017 [whereby the respondent had been
accorded a fresh tenure of 89 days to work as Senior Resident in the
Department of Dermatology] which, in the normal course, was to end on
4.4.    Given the turn of events, the petitioner-hospital decided to grant
maternity leave to the respondent till 27.06.2017; although, earlier via office
order dated 23.05.2017, the respondent’s tenure was truncated and it was,
abruptly, brought to an end on 24.04.2017, when she had applied for
maternity leave on 17.04.2017.
4.5 This position emerges upon a perusal of the communication dated
29.06.2017, addressed by the Medical Superintendent of the petitioner-
hospital to the Member, NCW.
4.6    The record also shows that in the interregnum, the respondent had
filed a representation dated 24.07.2017, for being granted maternity leave
for 26 weeks. This representation was rejected by the petitioner-hospital, via
order dated 03.08.2017, apparently, on account of the fact that it had already
taken a position to the contrary in its communication dated 29.06.2017,
addressed to the Member, NCW. In sum, the reasons furnished by the
petitioner-hospital as to why the maternity benefit was declined to the
respondent for the entire period of 26 weeks are the following:
(i)    The respondent’s ad-hoc tenure i.e., the last extension expired on
27.06.2017, and, therefore, the maternity leave could not be granted beyond
the said date.
(ii)   Although the respondent had been shortlisted for recruitment for
appointment to the (regular) post of Senior Resident, along with other
candidates, she had not appeared in the interview, which was held on
(iia) In this context, it is relevant to note that in and about 30.04.2017, the
petitioner-hospital had published an advertisement for recruiting Senior
Resident Doctors in the Department of Dermatology against sanctioned
posts. The petitioner-hospital claims that after interviews were conducted
and the results were declared, offers of appointment to the selected
candidates were made on 15.06.2017. The selected candidates, apparently,
joined the Department of Dermatology on 21.06.2017.
(iib) We may also note, at this stage, that the expected date of delivery of
the respondent was 02/06.06.2017.
4.7.   Insofar as the respondent was concerned, she once again took up
cudgels and approached the Tribunal with a fresh action. Via this O.A.,
which was numbered as O.A.No.508/2018, the respondent sought the
“(a) Revoke the termination letter dated 23.05.2017 and thus
reinstating the applicant at the post of Senior Resident.
(b) Extend the maternity benefits to the applicant for a period
of 26 weeks from the date of her application 17.04.2017.”
4.8.   As noticed at the outset, the Tribunal, partially allowed the aforesaid
O.A., and, consequently, issued the following directions qua the petitioner-
“(a) the respondents shall extend the benefit of the maternity
leave to the applicant in terms of Section 5(2) of the Maternity
Benefit Act, 1961 within four weeks from today.
(b) respondents shall also issue a certificate to the applicant
indicating the length of service rendered by her in the hospital.”
4.9.   This time around, the petitioner-hospital was aggrieved, and,
therefore, approached this Court by way of the instant writ petition.
5.     The writ petition was listed before the Court for the first time on
04.02.2020. On that date, the matter was directed to be re-listed on
12.02.2020. On 12.02.2020, notice was issued in the writ petition and, in the
interregnum, the operation of the impugned order [i.e., the order dated
03.05.2019] passed by the Tribunal was stayed.
5.1.   On the date which followed i.e., 29.06.2020, the Court disposed of an
application i.e., CM No.13561/2020 filed by the respondent for issuance of
an experience certificate. The Court directed the petitioner-hospital to issue
an experience certificate to the respondent spanning between 05.04.2016 and
17.04.2017; perhaps bearing in mind the fact that she had discharged her
duties as a doctor up until that date notwithstanding the relief sought in the
application pegged the end date to 27.06.2017.
5.2.   Thereafter, due to the intercession of Covid-19, the first substantive
hearing was held on 28.07.2021. Since it was unclear as to whether or not
the respondent had received the maternity benefits between 01.06.2017 and
27.06.2017, the petitioner-hospital was requested to obtain instructions at
the hearing held on 05.08.2021. This position attained clarity at the hearing
held on 08.09.2021. The respondent informed the court that she had received
maternity benefits for the period spanning between 01.06.2017 and
27.06.2017. It was further clarified that the respondent, thus, claimed
maternity benefit for the remaining period i.e., between 28.06.2017 and
5.3.   We also notice that the terminal date which the respondent’s counsel
provided i.e., 16.10.2017 was relatable to Section 5 of the Maternity Benefit
Act, 1961 (in short, the “1961 Act”), as the twenty-six [26] weeks’ maternity
benefit in the respondent’s case would end on that date.
5.4.   Ultimately, the matter was reserved for judgment on 11.10.2021.
6.     It is in this backdrop that the arguments were advanced on behalf of
the petitioner-hospital by Ms Mini Pushkarna, while on behalf of the
respondent, submissions were made by Ms Mansi Bajaj.
Submissions on behalf of the petitioner-hospital:
7.     Ms Pushkarna, broadly, made the following assertions :
(i)    That the Tribunal had erred in directing the petitioner-hospital to grant
maternity leave to the respondent for the entire 26 weeks, without having
regard to the fact that her tenure had culminated on 27.06.2017.
(ii)   The respondent’s tenure had been brought to an end in terms of the
contract, and upon a recruitment process being triggered, appointments on
regular basis were made by the petitioner-hospital in and about June 2017.
(iii)  If the respondent was granted maternity leave for the entire 26 weeks,
it would, in effect, result in extending her tenure. This would place an
immense financial burden upon the petitioner-hospital.
(iv)   The office memorandum dated 14.03.2018 issued by the Health and
Family Welfare Department of GNCTD, while providing for the grant of
maternity leave to ad hoc employees, carefully confined the benefit to the
period for which an ad hoc employee has been appointed.
(v) In support of her submissions, Ms Pushkarna placed reliance upon the
1. Dr Deepasha Garg v. Govind Bhallabh Pant Institute of
Postgraduate Medical Education and Research and Others, passed
in W.P (C) 13231/2018 decided on 10.12.2018
2. Dr Kavita Yadav v. The Secretary, Ministry of Health and Family
Welfare Department & Ors., passed in W.P (C) 8884/2019, decided
3. Dr Artiben R. Thakkar v. Delhi Pharmaceuticals Science &
Research University, 2019 SCC Online Del 10520, decided on
4. Govt. of NCT Delhi and Anr. v. Smt. Dr Priyanka Mittal, passed in
in W.P (C) 9092/2019, decided on 23.01.2020
(vi)   Besides the aforementioned judgements, reliance was also placed on
the judgement of the Jharkhand High Court rendered in Priti Kumar Gope v.
The Director, Punjab National Bank & Ors, passed in W.P (C) 1345/2018,
8.     Ms Bajaj, on the other hand, brought to fore the fact that when the
respondent applied for leave on 17.04.2017, her tenure, which in the normal
course would have ended on 27.06.2017, was abruptly brought to an end, via
order dated 23.05.2017 and that too retrospectively i.e., with effect from
8.1.    It was contended that this step of the petitioner-hospital was contrary
to the provisions of Section 12 of the 1961 Act, as amended in 2017. The
submission was that the respondent was entitled to maternity benefit till
16.10.2017, in terms of Section 5 of the 1961 Act. In other words, if a
woman employee worked for a minimum of eighty [80] days in the twelve
[12] months preceding the date of her expected delivery, she should be
granted maternity leave for the entire 26 weeks.
8.2.     To buttress her submissions, Ms Bajaj also alluded to Articles 15 (3)
and 42 of the Constitution. It was emphasised that the only reason the
respondent was denied an extension of tenure was, on account of the fact
that she had applied for maternity leave on 17.04.2017.
8.4.     It was stressed that if the petitioner-hospital’s stand is to be accepted,
then no ad hoc employee would be able to avail maternity leave for the
entire 26 weeks, as provided in Section 5 of the 1961 Act.
8.5.     In support of her submissions, Ms Bajaj has relied upon the following
(i) Manisha Priyadarshini v. Aurobindo College-Evening & Ors.,
passed in LPA No.595/2019, decided on 01.05.2020.
(ii)Bharti Gupta v. Rail India Technical and Economical Services Ltd.,
2005 (84) DRJ 53, decided on 09.08.2005.
9.       Having heard the learned counsel for the parties, we are of the view
that the following facts have emerged qua which there is no dispute :
(i)      The petitioner-hospital had employed the respondent as Senior
Resident Doctor in the Department of Dermatology, albeit, on an ad-hoc
basis.
(ii)     Each time the respondent was appointed, she was accorded a tenure of
89 days. The first tenure spanned between 05.04.2016 and 02.07.2016,
which was followed by a fresh appointment being made with a short break
of one day. This methodology was followed on four occasions. For the sake
of easy reference, the details of the period served by the respondent are set
Tenure No.        Served from           Served till       Break Date
(iii)  The last tenure appointment of the respondent was made on
31.03.2017 which, in the ordinary course, would have come to an end on
27.06.2017. It is between this period [i.e., between 31.03.2017 and
27.06.2017] that the respondent applied for maternity leave. The leave
application, in that behalf, was preferred by the respondent on 17.04.2017.
(iv)   The petitioner-hospital instead of granting the respondent maternity
leave passed an order on 23.05.2017. The relevant part of the said order is
The Medical Superintendent is pleased to grant leave of the kind
due (08 CL) to Dr Krati Mehrotra Senior Resident (SKIN) on
Adhoc Basis from dt. 17.04.2017 to 24.04.2017 in view of [an]
exceptional medical condition.
Her tenure may be treated as complete on date 24.04.2017.
In view of [ the] exceptional situation/condition the recovery of
seven (07) days salary in view of notice period has also been
waved[ sic: waived] off by competent authority." [Emphasis is
(v)    Although, the respondent approached the Tribunal for being accorded
relief, the Tribunal vide order dated 31.05.2017 passed in O.A. No.
1956/2017 gave leeway to the respondent to make a “comprehensive
representation” concerning her grievances. Furthermore, via the very same
order, the Tribunal also directed the petitioner-hospital to pass a speaking
order on the respondent's representation. As noticed above, the respondent
preferred a representation on 01.06.2017; an aspect which has not been
refuted by the petitioner-hospital in the counter-affidavit filed before the
(vi)   It appears that because the respondent was, in a sense, dissatisfied
with the aforesaid order of the Tribunal that she approached the NCW.
Apparently, with the intercession of the NCW, the petitioner-hospital
decided to infuse fresh life into the order dated 03.04.2017 i.e., the order
whereby the respondent was appointed for the last time for a period
spanning between 31.03.2017 and 27.06.2017.
(vii) As noticed above, the order dated 03.04.2017 had lost its efficacy
after the petitioner-hospital had passed the order dated 23.05.2017.
Therefore, in sum, the petitioner-hospital in the first instance, practically,
denied granting any maternity leave to the respondent. The only leave that
was granted to the respondent was casual leave, and that too for eight [8]
days. It is only when the NCW intervened that the petitioner-hospital
decided to grant maternity leave to the respondent till the time her last tenure
in the normal course was to expire i.e., 27.06.2017.
(viii) What has not been put in issue by the petitioner-hospital is that when
the respondent had applied for maternity leave i.e., on 17.04.2017, she was
pregnant.
(ix)   What is also not in dispute is that the petitioner did make a
representation on 17.04.2017 for being granted maternity leave benefit for
the entire period of 26 weeks.
10.    The stance taken by the petitioner-hospital that the maternity leave
benefit cannot extend beyond the period when the contractual period of an
ad hoc employee comes to an end is an aspect that is required to be
examined by us. We may note that this stance is based on, firstly, the OM
dated 14.03.2018, and the judgments referred to in paragraph 7(v) above.
11.    Before we proceed further, it would be relevant to advert to the
Preamble appended to the 1961 Act, and the Statement of Objects and
“An Act to regulate the employment of women in certain
establishments for certain periods before and after child-birth and to
provide for maternity benefit and certain other benefits.”
“Statement of Objects and Reasons.- Maternity protection is at
present provided under the different State Acts on the subject and
three Central Acts, viz., the Mines Maternity Benefit Act, 1941 the
Employees’ State Insurance Act, 1948 and the Plantation Labour Act,
1951. There is considerable diversity in their provisions relating to
qualifying conditions, period and rate of benefit, etc. The proposed
legislation seeks to reduce as far as possible the existing disparities in
this respect. It will apply to all establishments, including mines,
factories and plantations, except those to which the Employees’ State
Insurance Act, 1948 applies and its provisions approximate as nearly
as possible to those of the Act.”
11.1 As would be evident from the extract set forth above, the 1961 Act
seeks to regulate the employment of women in certain establishments for
given periods before and after child-birth, and, in particular, endeavours to
provide for maternity benefit.
11.2. Furthermore, because there was a considerable diversity about how
maternity benefits played out in various State Acts and Central Acts
concerning qualifying conditions, period and rate of benefit, the 1961 act
was enacted to remove such disparities.
11.3. The expression “maternity benefit” is defined in section 3(h) of the
1961 Act. The said provision simply states that maternity benefit means
payment referred to in sub-section (1) of Section 5 of the 1961 Act.
11.4 Section 5(1), broadly, provides that every woman would be entitled to
payment of maternity benefit at the rate provided therein, for a period when
she is absent i.e., the period immediately preceding the day of her delivery,
the actual day of her delivery and any period immediately following that
day. The employer's liability to grant maternity benefits is absolute. For
purposes of this case, the explanation appended to Section 5(1) of the 1961
Act is not of any particular relevance, and, hence, one need not allude to it.
11.5 However, sub-section (2) of Section 5, simply put, requires a woman
to work in the establishment of her employer for a minimum period of 80
days in the 12 months, immediately preceding the date of her expected
delivery, to avail of maternity benefit.
11.6 Sub-section (3) of Section 5, pithily put, provides the maximum
period for which maternity benefit can be accorded to the woman-employee.
The period provided is 26 weeks, of which, not more than 8 weeks should
precede the date of expected delivery.
11.7 Section 27 of the 1961 Act captures a non-obstante clause, which,
inter alia, states that the provisions of the 1961 Act shall have effect
notwithstanding anything inconsistent contained in any other law or any
award, agreement or contract of service, whether made before or after the
coming into force of said Act.
12     Clearly, the provisions of the 1961 Act seek to invest a woman with a
statutory right to take maternity leave and seek payment for the period that
she is absent from duty on account of her pregnancy, albeit in accordance
with the provisions of the 1961 Act.
12.1. As noticed above, the rate and the period for which maternity benefits
have to be accorded to the respondent are embedded in the 1961 Act; in
particular, Section 5 of the 1961 Act. For the sake of convenience, the
relevant provisions of Section 5 are set forth below :
“5. Right to payment of maternity benefits. – (1) Subject to
the provisions of this Act, every woman shall be entitled to, and her
employer shall be liable for, the payment of maternity benefit at the
rate of the average daily wage for the period of her actual absence,
that is to say, the period immediately preceding the day of her
delivery, the actual day of her delivery and any period immediately
following that day.
(2) No woman shall be entitled to maternity benefit unless she has
actually worked in an establishment of the employer from whom she
claims maternity benefit, for a period of not less than [eighty days] in
the twelve months immediately preceding the date of her expected
Explanation. – For the purpose of calculating under this sub-section
the days on which a woman has actually worked in the establishment
[the days for which she has been laid-off or was on holidays declared
under any law for the time being in force to be holidays with wages],
during the period of twelve months immediately preceding the date of
her expected delivery shall be taken into account.
(3) The maximum period for which any woman shall be entitled to
maternity benefit shall be [twenty-six weeks of which not more than
eight weeks] shall precede the date of her expected delivery
Provided that the maximum period entitled to maternity benefit by a
woman having two or more than two surviving children shall be
twelve weeks of which not more than six weeks shall precede the date
of her expected delivery.”
12.2. The provisions of the 1961 Act do not differentiate between a
permanent employee and a contractual employee, or even a daily wage
(muster roll) worker. This position stands unambiguously articulated in the
judgement of the Supreme Court rendered in Municipal Corporation of
Delhi (MCD) v. Female Workers (Muster Roll) & Anr. (2000) 3 SCC 224.
13.    Pertinently, the 1961 Act does not tie in the grant of maternity benefit
to the tenure of the woman employee.
13.1 There are two limiting factors for the grant of maternity benefits.
(i)    First, the woman-employee should have worked in an establishment
of her employer for a minimum period of 80 days in 12 months immediately
preceding the date of her expected delivery.
(ii)   Second, the maximum period for which she can avail maternity leave
benefit cannot exceed 26 weeks, of which, not more than 8 weeks shall
precede the date of her expected delivery.
13.2. For a woman employee who has two or more surviving children,
although the maximum period for which she can claim maternity benefit is
12 weeks, the period preceding the date of expected delivery cannot be more
than 6 weeks.
13.3. Therefore, linking the tenure of employment, in this case, a
contractual employee, with the period for which maternity benefits can be
availed by a woman employee, is not an aspect that emerges on a plain
reading of the provisions of the 1961 Act.
13.4. Section 27 of the 1961 Act, which embeds, a non-obstante clause,
expounds that the provisions of the said Act would apply notwithstanding
the provisions contained, inter alia, in any other law, agreement or contract
of service, to the extent it is inconsistent with the provisions of the said Act.
13.5. The object and purpose of the 1961 Act being, to not only regulate
employment but also maternity benefits which precede and follow
childbirth, point in the direction that tying up the tenure of the contract with
the period for which a woman employee can avail of maternity benefit is
contrary to the mandate of the legislation i.e., the 1961 Act.
14.    Thus, as long as conception occurs before the tenure of the contract
executed between a woman-employee and her employer expires, she should
be entitled to, in our opinion, maternity benefits as provided under the 1961
14.1. The ethos of the 1961 Act, in the backdrop of the international
covenants framed by the United Nations and the provisions of the Indian
Constitution, have been captured in the judgement of the Supreme Court
rendered in the Female Workers (Muster Roll) case. The following
observations being apposite, are set forth hereafter :
“27. The provisions of the Act which have been set out above would
indicate that they are wholly in consonance with the Directive
Principles of State Policy, as set out in Article 39 and in other
articles, specially Article 42. A woman employee, at the time of
advanced pregnancy cannot be compelled to undertake hard
labour as it would be detrimental to her health and also to the
health of the foetus. It is for this reason that it is provided in the
Act that she would be entitled to maternity leave for certain
periods prior to and after delivery. We have scanned the different
provisions of the Act, but we do not find anything contained in the
Act which entitles only regular women employees to the benefit of
maternity leave and not to those who are engaged on [a] casual
basis or on muster roll [or] on daily-wage basis.
33. A just social order can be achieved only when inequalities are
obliterated and everyone is provided what is legally due. Women who
constitute almost half of the segment of our society have to be
honoured and treated with dignity at places where they work to earn
their livelihood. Whatever be the nature of their duties, their avocation
and the place where they work, they must be provided all the facilities
to which they are entitled. To become a mother is the most natural
phenomenon in the life of a woman. Whatever is needed to facilitate
the birth of [a] child to a woman who is in service, the employer has
to be considerate and sympathetic towards her and must realise the
physical difficulties which a working woman would face in
performing her duties at the workplace while carrying a baby in the
womb or while rearing up the child after birth. The Maternity Benefit
Act, 1961 aims to provide all these facilities to a working woman in a
dignified manner so that she may overcome the state of motherhood
honourably, peaceably, undeterred by the fear of being victimised for
forced absence during the pre-or post-natal period.
This extract is taken from Municipal Corpn. of Delhi v. Female
37. Delhi is the capital of India. No other city or corporation would be
more conscious than the city of Delhi that India is a signatory to
various international covenants and treaties. The Universal
Declaration of Human Rights, adopted by the United Nations on 10-
12-1948, set in motion the universal thinking that human rights are
supreme and ought to be preserved at all costs. This was followed by
a series of conventions. On 18-12-1979, the United Nations adopted
the “Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination
against Women”. Article 11 of this Convention provides as under:
1. States/parties shall take all appropriate measures to eliminate
discrimination against women in the field of employment in order to
ensure, on a basis of equality of men and women, the same rights, in
(a) the right to work as an inalienable right of all human beings;
(b) the right to the same employment opportunities, including the
application of the same criteria for selection in matters of
(c) the right to free choice of profession and employment, the right to
promotion, job security and all benefits and conditions of service and
the right to receive vocational training and retraining, including
apprenticeships, advanced vocational training and recurrent training;
(d) the right to equal remuneration, including benefits, and to equal
treatment in respect of work of equal value, as well as equality of
treatment in the evaluation of the quality of work;
(e) the right to social security, particularly in cases of retirement,
unemployment, sickness, invalidity and old age and other incapacity
(f) the right to protection of health and to safety in working
conditions, including the safeguarding of the function of reproduction.
2. In order to prevent discrimination against women on the grounds of
marriage or maternity and to ensure their effective right to work,
States/parties shall take appropriate measures:
(a) to prohibit, subject to the imposition of sanctions, dismissal on the
grounds of pregnancy or of maternity leave and discrimination in
(b) to introduce maternity leave with pay or with comparable social
benefits without loss of former employment, seniority or social
(c) to encourage the provision of the necessary supporting social
services to enable parents to combine family obligations with work
responsibilities and participation in public life, in particular through
promoting the establishment and development of a network of child-
(d) to provide special protection to women during pregnancy in
types of work proved to be harmful to them.
3. Protective legislation relating to matters covered in this article shall
be reviewed periodically in the light of scientific and technological
knowledge and shall be revised, repealed or extended as necessary.”
38. These principles which are contained in Article 11,
reproduced above, have to be read into the contract of service
between the Municipal Corporation of Delhi and the women
employees (muster roll); and so read these employees immediately
become entitled to all the benefits conceived under the Maternity
14.2 Hon’ble Mr Justice Ravindra Bhat (as he then was), in the case of
Bharti Gupta has noticed these very aspects in the following paragraphs of
“7. The pleadings in this case show that the petitioner, a qualified
Architect had been engaged on [a] contractual basis by the respondent
RITES. Apparently, the contract was for spells of six months. As is
evident from an examination of the last contract/order dated 23.5.2000,
RITES was issuing the contracts/appointment letters, for fresh periods
after the expiry of the previous period(s). For instance, the order dated
23.5.2000 states that the term of employment is six months from
17.4.2000 to 16.10.2000. The petitioner has further averred that her
employment was continued on a routine basis and a [sic] fresh contracts
were being issued subsequently. This fact has not been disputed. On the
other hand, the case of the respondent RITES is that the letter by which
the petitioner claimed maternity leave was in fact furnished by her on
17.11.2000. If these facts are kept in mind, it is apparent that though the
period of [the]contractual appointment came to an end on 16.10.2000, the
petitioner continued to report for duties. The letter seeking leave does
indicate that the petitioner would be on leave after 11.11.2000. The
RITES does not dispute the existence of this letter; it only alleges that the
letter in fact was given on 17.11.2000. It would thus be clear that as per
the understanding of the parties and the past practice, the petitioner
continued to be with the respondent's organisation after 16.10.2000.
8. In this view of the matter, and having regard to the fact that the
petitioner is not pressing her claim for reinstatement the issue for
decision is whether the respondent would have denied maternity benefits
under the 1961 Act.
9. The nature of maternity benefits and the entitlement of employees
have been clearly spelt out by provisions of the Act. The provisions of
the enactment apply to establishments, which have been defined in an
expansive manner. Being a benevolent and social welfare legislation, the
term "establishment" has to be construed liberally to include RITES.
10. Sections 4 & 5 of the Act oblige every employer of an establishment
to extend maternity benefits under the Act, including leave/pay and
maternity bonus. Section 12 underscores the independent and inflexible
nature of the liability to mandate that no-one can be dismissed on account
of pregnancy. It is a non-discriminatory provision. Section 27 mandates
that provisions of the Act would have overriding effect.
11. In the Municipal Corporation of Delhi case (supra) the need for the
Act, and its objective being in furtherance to Articles 15(3), 21, 38-39
and 42-43 of the Constitution of India was noticed. The Court also
noticed that the Act was in tune with the United Nations' Convention on
the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination Against Women
12. Articles 14 and 15 of the Constitution guarantee equality, Article
15(3) enables the State to make special provision for women. The Act
makes provisions that are are in furtherance of two objectives-affirmative
action (Sections 4, 5 and 27) and non-discrimination (Sections 12, 21 and
23). Their universality is undeniable.
13. RITES, in my considered opinion, is an establishment covered under
the Act. Equally, it is an instrumentality of State (under Article 12 of the
Constitution of India) and therefore bound by Part III of the Constitution.
The record shows that the petitioner continued in employment till
11.11.2000, as per the RITES itself. The last order, extending the
contract of appointment by 6 months, was issued on May, 2000,; the
previous period had expired on 17.4.2000. Hence, the period commenced
on 17.4.2000, and continued till 16.10.2000. In view of these admitted
facts, and the circumstance that the petitioner went on leave with effect
from 11.11.2000, after which she delivered a baby on 5.12.2000, the
RITES cannot excape its obligation to pay benefits under the Maternity
14. I accordingly, partly allow the petition. A direction is issued to the
respondent RITES to calculate and release all amounts payable under the
Maternity Benefits Act, 1961 (including full salary for the maximum
periods of leave permissible under the Act and also the bonus amount
admissible) within a period of six weeks from today. No costs.”
15.    As noticed above, Ms Pushkarna has cited various judgements of this
Court, in support of her plea that maternity benefits cannot be granted to the
respondent, beyond the tenure of the contract.
15.1 The principal judgement on which reliance is placed by Ms Pushkarna
is rendered in Dr Kavita Yadav’s case. Apart from anything else, this
judgement is distinguishable for the reason that it dealt with a fixed-term
contract that had ended on 11.06.2017. The woman employee, in that case,
had applied for leave, after her contract which was for a maximum period of
3 years had come to an end. The court, therefore, concluded that the
maternity benefit sought for by the petitioner could not be granted to her
beyond 11.06.2017. Importantly, the judgement in the case of Bharti Gupta
was cited before the Court. The Court distinguished the said judgement i.e.,
Bharti Gupta, on the ground that there was no outer-limit fixed qua the
petitioner in that case. This is evident from the following observations made
in the judgement, which are extracted below :
“13. Coming to the decision in Bharti Gupta (supra) we find that in
this case though the appointment of the petitioner was contractual for
six months, there was no outer limit to such contracts. The Court
found, as a matter of fact, that the contract of the petitioner used to be
extended after the expiry of the contract period, while the petitioner
15. From the above, it would, firstly, be seen that the learned Single
Judge proceeded on the basis that the contractual term was open
ended inasmuch, as, the contract was regularly being extended for a
period of six months, after the expiry of the period of the contractual
period itself, while the petitioner was permitted to continue to
serve…….”
15.1(a) The situation which obtains in the present case is quite similar. As
noticed above in the course of narration of facts, the respondent’s contract
was extended on four occasions, with a break of one day in between. Each
time the contract had a tenure of 89 days. The last such contract was
executed on 31.03.2017, which in the normal course would have come to an
end on 27.06.2017. The respondent had applied for the grant of maternity
leave on 17.04.2017. Therefore, this judgement is clearly distinguishable,
and the manner in which Bharti Gupta case was sought to be distinguished,
would, in a sense, bolster the stand of the respondent in the instant case.
15.2. The other judgement on which reliance was placed by Ms Pushkarna
was rendered in Dr Deepasha Garg's case. This was a case where the
woman-employee had applied for leave on account of pregnancy on the date
when her contract was to expire. The grievance articulated by the woman-
employee in that case, essentially, concerned the denial by her employer of
the experience certificate for the period which includes the maternity leave
period that spilled beyond the last date of her contract.
15.2(a) In the instant case, as noticed above, the respondent has not sought
the issuance of experience certificate beyond the date when her contract
came to an end in the normal course i.e., 27.06.2017. The respondent has
confined the relief only to the grant of maternity benefits in consonance with
the provisions of the 1961 Act. This judgement, therefore, is also
distinguishable as the emphasis is on an aspect with which one is not
concerned in the present matter.
15.3. The third judgment that was relied upon by Ms Pushkarna is a
decision rendered in the matter of Dr Artiben R. Thakkar. The facts
delineated in the said judgement disclose that the terminal date of the
contract of the woman-employee was 15.05.2017. Two months before the
expiry of the contract, the woman-employee made an application for being
granted 12 weeks of maternity leave. This request of the woman-employee
was accepted, and as a matter of fact, her contract was extended up till
30.06.2017. However, after 30.06.2017, neither was the contract renewed
nor was a fresh contract executed between the women-employee and her
employer. The woman employee's plea for extending the maternity benefit
for the full period of 26 weeks appears to have been declined on the ground
that she did not make an application for a grant of maternity leave for the
entire period of 26 weeks before the contract came to an end. As noticed
above, after the extension was granted by the employer, the contract expired
by efflux of time on 30.06.2017. The Court found, as a matter of fact, that
after that date i.e., 30.06.2017, women-employee did not remain on the rolls
of the employer.
15.3(a) The judgement in Dr Artiben R. Thakkar's case is distinguishable
on facts. In the instant case, the respondent had sought maternity leave in the
very first instance for the entire period of 26 weeks, and more importantly,
when this application was made, her contract with the petitioner was alive.
15.4. The fourth judgement on which reliance is placed by Ms Pushkarna is
the judgement rendered in the case of Dr Priyanka Mittal. This judgement
adopts the ratio of the decisions rendered in Dr Deepasha Garg's case and
Dr Kavita Yadav's case. There is, in fact, no discussion in the said
judgement concerning the provisions of the 1961 Act. In particular, Section
5 of the 1961 Act.
15.5. The last judgement on which reliance is placed by Ms Pushkarna is
the judgement of a Single Judge of the Jharkhand High Court in the case of
Priti Kumar Gope. A perusal of this judgement would show that the Court
has found that this was also a case of a fixed-term contract and not an open-
ended contract, where the contract between the employer and employee was
extended from time to time.
16.    Before we conclude, we may point out that there is a generic assertion
made in the writ petition by the petitioner-hospital that Senior Resident
doctors are appointed on a contractual basis, whenever a need arises for such
appointments, albeit for a maximum period of 3 years. This contention of
Ms Pushkarna has, however, very little relevance in the present case.
16.1 As noticed hereinabove, the petitioner-hospital executed short-
duration contracts with the respondent. Each time the tenure of the contract
was 89 days, and after a short break, a fresh contract was executed with the
respondent. Neither in the offer of appointment dated 22.03.2016 issued to
the respondent nor, in the joining order dated 24.05.2016, there is a mention
of the fact that the maximum period for which the respondent could have
been retained on a contractual basis. There is, however, a reference to the
Residency Scheme of the Government of India [GOI]. Even if one were to
take into account that the maximum period, for which contract could be
executed from time to time between the petitioner-hospital and the
respondent, could not go beyond 3 years, as per the Residency Scheme of
GOI (although the same was not placed on record), the petitioner’s period
had not expired. The three years in the respondent’s case, after she joined on
05.04.2016, would have ended in and around 04.04.2019. The period for
which the respondent seeks payment of maternity benefit, as noticed above,
spans between 28.06.2017 and 16.10.2017.
16.3. We may note that, by way of illustration, the respondent had filed
before the Tribunal the copies of two office orders dated 12.08.2016 and
10.01.2017, concerning, inter alia, one Dr Banashree Nath, who was
appointed as Senior Resident on an ad hoc basis in the Safdarjung Hospital,
New Delhi. The office order dated 12.08.2016 shows that although the
tenure of Dr Nath spanned between 31.07.2016 and 27.10.2016, she was
granted maternity leave for 180 days starting from 25.07.2016 to
20.01.2017. These facts have not been refuted by the petitioner-hospital in
the counter-affidavit filed before the Tribunal. Thus, this suggests that the
GOI has granted maternity benefit, beyond the tenure of the contract.
Therefore, the petitioner's hospital approach doesn't seem to be in line, either
with the provisions of the 1961 Act or the GOI's approach adopted vis-à-vis
hospital(s), which are under their sway.
17.    This brings us to the circular dated 14.03.2018, on which reliance is
placed by petitioner-hospital. The title of the circular, along with the
“Sub: Guidelines for grant of Maternity Leave/ Miscarriage Leave to
Resident doctors (SRs/JRs/SR (Adhoc) & JR (Adhoc)).
As per Section 5(2) of the Maternity Benefit Act, 1931, no woman
shall be entitled to maternity benefits unless she has actually worked
in an establishment of the employer from whom she claims maternity
benefits for a period of not less than one hundred and sixty days in the
twelve months immediately preceding the date of her expected
delivery.
It has been decided that the Resident doctors (SRs/JRs/SR (Adhoc) &
JR (Adhoc)) shall be entitled for maternity leaves of 26 weeks and
miscarriage leave of 06 weeks as per Maternity Benefit Act, 1961 and
Maternity Benefit (Amendment) Act, 2017, in accordance with section
5(2) of the Maternity Benefit Act, 1961 subject to the condition that no
leave shall be granted after the completion/expiry of tenure of the
doctor concerned……”
17.1. A close perusal of the aforesaid circular would reveal that it is in the
nature of a guideline, inter alia, for grant of maternity benefit to the Senior
Resident doctors who are employed on an ad hoc basis. The petitioner-
hospital seeks to lay great emphasis on that part of the circular, which says
that maternity leave would be accorded for 26 weeks in consonance with
Section 5(2) of 1961 Act, “subject to the condition that no leave shall be
granted after completion/expiry of [the] tenure of the doctor concerned”.
17.2 To our minds, this circular would have no applicability for two
reasons: firstly, it is a guideline; and secondly, the circular cannot go beyond
the provisions of the 1961 Act; in particular, sub-section (2) of section 5 of
the 1961 Act, and lastly, circulars much less guidelines cannot impede,
preempt judicial interpretation that a Court may place on the scope and
ambit of a provision in the Act. [See Keshavji Ravji And Co. And Others v.
Commissioner of Income Tax, (1990) 2 SCC 231.]
17.3. As adverted to hereinabove, there is nothing stated in sub-section (2)
of section 5 of the 1961 Act which links the grant of maternity to the tenure
of the contract.
18.    We may also touch upon an argument that was sought to be raised by
Ms Pushkarna for the petitioner-hospital, that a fresh contract was not
executed with the respondent because recruitment of regular employees had
taken place.
18.1. While we are on this aspect, it needs to be noticed, that much has been
sought to be made by the petitioner-hospital that the respondent had been
called for an interview when candidates were being selected against the
sanctioned posts. What has emerged from the record is that the respondent
was called for an interview on a date, which was perilously close to her
expected date of delivery. The respondent was required to attend the
interview on 01.06.2017, whereas the expected date of delivery was
02/06.06.2017. As adverted to above, the respondent’s pregnancy had
encountered unexpected complications.
18.2. Be that as it may, in our opinion, this aspect has no relevance as far as
the grant of the maternity benefit is concerned. The respondent is not
seeking a direction for the execution of a fresh contract. The only relief that
the respondent seeks is the grant of maternity benefits under the 1961 Act.
The benefit granted to the respondent under Section 5 of the 1961 Act
should have a full play, in our view, once the prerequisites contained therein
are fulfilled by the claimant i.e., the woman-employee. The 1961Act is a
social legislation that should be worked in a manner that progresses not only
the best interest of the women-employee but also of the child, both at the
pre-natal and post-natal stage. [See Article 24(2)(d) of the United Nations
Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC)12.] Without financial
wherewithal, the interest of women-employee and her child is likely to be
severely impacted.
19.     Thus, for the foregoing reasons, we are not inclined to interfere with
the impugned order passed by the Tribunal.
20.     The writ petition is, accordingly, dismissed. Consequently, pending
application shall stand closed.
21.     Parties will bear their own costs.
1. States Parties recognize the right of the child to the enjoyment of the highest attainable
standard of health and to facilities for the treatment of illness and rehabilitation of health.
States Parties shall strive to ensure that no child is deprived of his or her right of access to
such health care services.
2. States Parties shall pursue full implementation of this right and, in particular, shall take
(d) To ensure appropriate pre-natal and post-natal health care for mothers;
Notably, India is a signatory to CRC.
