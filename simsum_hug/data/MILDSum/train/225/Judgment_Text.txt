For R5 in W.P.Nos.28284,     :      Mr.R.Sankaranarayanan,
28287, 28288, 28291 of 2021         Assistant Solicitor General
W.P.Nos.28284, 28287, 28288, 28291 of 2021
The issue involved in these writ petitions are one and the same and as
such, they are taken up together and disposed of by this common order.
2. The prayer in these writ petitions is for a Mandamus directing the
respondents to sanction annual increment to the petitioners in the B.T.
Assistant posts as well as incentive increment for having acquired Post
Graduation, without reference to passing of Teachers Eligibility Test (TET)
with all consequential and other attendant benefits, based on the
representation submitted by the petitioners.
3. After the advent of Right of Children to Free and Compulsory
Education Act, 2009 [in short 'RTE Act'], the National Council for Technical
Education (NCTE) was appointed as academic authority under Section 23(1)
of the Act, who issued Notification dated 23.08.2010 prescribing educational
qualification for teachers taking classes for Standards I to VIII, which include
passing of Teachers Eligibility Test [TET] to be conducted by the appropriate
Government as one of the eligibility condition prescribed therein.
Subsequently, NCTE issued notification dated 27.09.2011, amending the
W.P.Nos.28284, 28287, 28288, 28291 of 2021
earlier notification dated 23.08.2010. As per the NCTE notification, passing
of TET, conducted by the appropriate Government has to be considered as
one of the eligibility condition for appointment to the post of teachers for
taking classes to Standards I to VIII.
4. Consequently, State Government has issued G.O.Ms.No.181, School
Education Department, dated 15.11.2011, appointing Teachers Recruitment
Board [TRB] as Nodal Agency to conduct TET and also to make appointment
to the post of Secondary Grade Teachers based on TET.
5. The petitioners were appointed prior to 2011 and their appointment
was also duly approved by the Department without any condition much prior
to G.O.Ms.No.181 dated 15.11.2011 and they were paid with annual
increments from the date of their initial appointment, but suddenly the third
respondent herein stopped the payment of annual increment in the post of
B.T. Assistant on the premise that the petitioners have to pass TET Test. It is
the grievance of the petitioners that TET cannot be insisted as per
G.O.Ms.No.181, School Education Department dated 15.11.2011, in respect
of appointment already made prior to the aforesaid Government order and
W.P.Nos.28284, 28287, 28288, 28291 of 2021
also duly approved by the Department and therefore, insisting upon passing
of TET is totally arbitrary and unreasonable and therefore, they have filed the
present writ petitions seeking for a direction to the respondents to sanction
annual increment to the petitioners in the post of B.T. Assistants as well as
incentive increment for having acquired Post Graduation without reference to
passing of TET with all consequential and other attendant benefits, based on
the representation submitted by the petitioners.
6. The District Education Officer, Central Chennai, Chennai-15 has
filed individual counter affidavits stating that the State Government has
carefully examined the issue on the line of the orders of the Hon'ble Supreme
Court in SLP(C)No.18227-18228 dated 28.08.2008 and NCTE Guidelines
and issued the following orders in respect of change of policy for recruitment
(i) In respect of Secondary Grade Teachers, the Statewide
seniority in Employment Exchange Registration will
continue to be followed till the disposal of the SLP filed in
the Supreme Court of India.
(ii) In respect of Graduate Assistants (B.T. Teaches recruited
by TRB for the Classes VI to X in all Middle Schools, High
& Higher Secondary Schools, selection through written
examinations (Teachers Eligibility Test) in accordance with
the guidelines framed by National Council for Teachers
W.P.Nos.28284, 28287, 28288, 28291 of 2021
Education and Certificate Verification will be followed.
(iii) The Teachers Recruitment Board is designated as a
Nodal Agency for Teachers Eligibility Test and recruitment
of Teachers.
It is further stated in the counter affidavit that the third respondent has
stopped the payment of annual increment to the petitioners, since the
petitioners did not possess and qualify the written examinations (TET) in
accordance with the guidelines framed by NCET and in the absence of TET
qualification, incentives cannot be granted to the petitioners.
7. Heard the learned counsel for the parties and perused the entire
materials placed before it.
8. The point for consideration is whether the petitioners / teachers, who
did not possess the minimum qualification of pass in TET as per RTE Act,
2009, prior to the date of commencement of RTE Act, 2009, are entitled to
annual increments and to continue in service as Teachers?
9. The Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act,
2009 (Act 35 of 2009) (for brevity RTE Act) came into force in the State of
Tamil Nadu with effect from 01.04.2010.
W.P.Nos.28284, 28287, 28288, 28291 of 2021
10. The constitutional validity of the RTE Act was questioned before
the Hon'ble Apex Court in Unaided Private Schools of Rajasthan v. Union
of India [(2012) 6 SCC 1] wherein in paragraph 64 of the judgment, the
Hon'ble Apex Court held that the RTE Act shall apply to the following
"64. Accordingly, we hold that the Right of Children to
Free and Compulsory Education Act, 2009 is constitutionally
(i) a school established, owned or controlled by the
appropriate Government or a local authority;
(ii) an aided school including aided minority school(s)
receiving aid or grants to meet whole or part of its expenses from
the appropriate Government or the local authority;
(iii) a school belonging to specified category; and
(iv) an unaided non-minority school not receiving any
kind of aid or grants to meet its expenses from the appropriate
In the light of the aforesaid decision of the Hon'ble Supreme Court, RTE Act
is applicable to the recognized School imparting elementary education and
includes a School established, owned or controlled by the appropriate
Government or a local authority, an aided school receiving aid or grants, a
school belonging to specified category and also unaided school not receiving
any kind of aid or grants.
W.P.Nos.28284, 28287, 28288, 28291 of 2021
11. As per Section 23(1) of the RTE Act, a person, who seeks
appointment in the schools covered under the RTE Act, to possess minimum
qualification as laid down by the Academic Authority. Section 23 of the RTE
"23. Qualifications for appointment and terms and
qualifications, as laid down by an academic authority,
authorised by the Central Government, by notification, shall
be eligible for appointment as a teacher.
(2) Where a State does not have adequate institutions
offering courses or training in teacher education, or teachers
possessing minimum qualifications as laid down under sub-
section (1) are not available in sufficient numbers, the Central
Government may, if it deems necessary, by notification, relax
the minimum qualifications required for appointment as a
teacher, for such period, not exceeding five years, as may be
Provided that a teacher who, at the commencement
of this Act, does not possess minimum qualifications as laid
down under sub-section (1), shall acquire such minimum
qualifications within a period of five years.
(3) The salary and allowance payable to, and the terms
and conditions of servie of, teacher shall be such as may be
Proviso to Section 23(2) of the RTE Act made it clear that teachers, who,
at the commencement of the Act, does not possess minimum qualifications
W.P.Nos.28284, 28287, 28288, 28291 of 2021
as laid down under sub-Section (1), shall acquire such minimum
qualifications within a period of five years.
12. The Government of India, by its notification dated 31.3.2010 issued
under Section 23(1) of RTE Act, authorised NCTE as the Academic Authority,
to lay down the minimum qualification for a person to be eligible for
appointment as a teacher. Pursuant to the aforesaid notification, the NCTE
has laid down minimum qualification for a person to be eligible for
appointment as a Teacher for the classes I to VIII in "school" referred to in
clause 2(n) of the RTE Act by the notification dated 23.8.2010, and one of the
minimum qualifications laid down therein is that a pass in TET to be
conducted by the appropriate Government in accordance with the guidelines
framed by NCTE for the purpose. The notification came into effect from
23.8.2010. Clause (5) of the NCTE notification dated 23.8.2010 made it
clear that if the process of appointment of Teachers was initiated prior to the
date of notification by issuing advertisement, such appointments to be made
in accordance with NCTE (Determination of Minimum Qualifications for
Recruitment of Teachers in Schools) Regulations, 2001.
W.P.Nos.28284, 28287, 28288, 28291 of 2021
13. Thus, a pass in TET, to be conducted by the appropriate
Government, in accordance with the Guidelines framed by the NCTE, was
made as an essential condition for appointment as a teacher, both for Classes
I to V and for Classes VI to VIII. Thereafter, NCTE also issued a set of
Guidelines, by their Memorandum, dated 11.02.2011, for the conduct of TET.
Paragraph 9 of the said Guidelines issued on 11.02.2011 stipulated that a
person who scores 60% and more in TET will be considered as having passed
the examination. Paragraph 9 also contained a small leverage for the grant of
"9. A person who scores 60% or more in the TET exam
will be considered as TET pass. School managements
(Government, local bodies, government aided and unaided)
(a) may consider giving concessions to persons belonging
to SC/ST, OBC, differently abled persons, etc. In accordance
(b) should give weightage to the TET scores in the
recruitment process; however, qualifying the TET would not
confer a right on any person for recruitment/employment as it is
only one of the eligibility criteria for appointment."
Para 11 of the Guidelines issued by NCTE dated 11.02.2011 stipulates the
frequency of conduct of TET and validity period of TET Certificate and the
W.P.Nos.28284, 28287, 28288, 28291 of 2021
“11. The approached Government should conduct a
TET at least once every year. The validity period of TET
qualifying certificate for appointment will be decided by the
appropriate Government subject to a maximum of seven years
for all categories. But there will be no restriction on the number
of attempts a person can take for acquiring a TET Certificate. A
person who has qualified TET may also appear again for
improving his/her score”.
14. Thereafter, by notification dated 29.7.2011, the NCTE amended its
earlier notification dated 23.8.2010. Clause (5) of the amended notification
5(a) Teacher appointed after the date of this Notification
Where an appropriate Government or local authority or a
school has issued an advertisement to initiate the process of
appointment of teachers prior to the date of this Notification,

(Determination of Minimum Qualifications for Recruitment of
Teachers in Schools) Regulations, 2001 (as amended from time
(b) The minimum qualification norms referred to in this
Notification apply to teachers of Languages, Social Studies,
Mathematics, Science, etc. In respect of teachers for Physical
Education, the minimum qualification norms for Physical
Education teachers referred to in NCTE Regulation dated 3rd
November, 2001 (as amended from time to time) shall be
applicable. For teachers of Art Education, Craft Education,
Home Science, Word Education, etc. the existing eligibility
norms prescribed by the State Government and other school
managements shall be applicable till such time the NCTE lays
down the minimum qualifications in respect of such teachers.”
W.P.Nos.28284, 28287, 28288, 28291 of 2021
15. Accepting the recommendation and the Notification issued by the
NCTE, the Government of Tamil Nadu have issued G.O.Ms.No.181, School
Education (C2) Department, dated 15.11.2011 which reads as follows:-
“The Right of Children to Free and Compulsory
Education Act, 2009 was enacted by the Parliament in 2009 to
provide for free and compulsory education to all children of
the age of 6-14 years. The Act was published in the Gazette of
India on 27th August 2009. Subsequently, the said Act was
republished by the Government of Tamil Nadu in the Tamil
Nadu Government Gazette on 24th February 2010. The said
Act came into force with effect from 1st April 2010.
2. As per sub-section (1) of Section 23 of the Right of
Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act, 2009 (RTE)
the National Council for Teacher Education (NCTE) has been
appointed as the Academic Authority by Government of India.
The said Academic Authority has indicated to all the States
that the teachers to be recruited in future for the elementary
segment should have passed the "Teacher Eligibility
Test"(TET) to be conducted by the appropriate Government in
accordance with the guidelines framed by the National
Council for Teacher Education for the purpose.
3. The said section clearly specifies that teachers who at
the commencement of this Act, do not possess minimum
qualifications as prescribed by the Academic Authority
authorized by the Central Government shall acquire such
minimum qualifications within a period of 5 years. Hence, the
"Teacher Eligibility Test (TET)" would have to be conducted
for recruiting teachers for the primary and upper primary
classes. The teachers working in unaided private schools are
required to pass Teacher Eligibility Test within 5 years. In the
State of Tamil Nadu, Secondary Grade Teachers (those
W.P.Nos.28284, 28287, 28288, 28291 of 2021
teaching classes I to V) are required to have minimum
qualifications of D.T.Ed. and Graduate Assistants (BT
Assistant) (those teaching classes VI to VIII) are required to
have minimum qualification of B.Ed. They should also pass
Teacher Eligibility Test forthwith.
4. However, with the passing of the RTE Act, it is now
mandatory for all the State Governments to recruit Secondary
Grade and BT teachers only by conducting a Teacher
iii The Teachers Recruitment Board is designate as the
Nodal Agency for conducting of Teacher Eligibility Test and
recruitment of Teachers.
8. Guidelines for conducting Teacher Eligibility Test is
enclosed in the Annexure to the Government Order.”
16. A bare reading of the G.O. extracted above would make it clear that
TET examination shall be conducted by the Teachers Recruitment Board in
accordance with the guidelines framed by NCTE. It prescribed a set of
guidelines for the conduct of TET in the Annexure. It has also specified that
teachers appointed prior to the issue of G.O.Ms.No.181 dated 15.11.2011 will
be given five years time to acquire the minimum qualification.
W.P.Nos.28284, 28287, 28288, 28291 of 2021
17. A Division Bench of this Court in the judgment dated 24.01.2017
made in W.A.Nos.1126 of 2015 etc. batch, [The State of Tamil Nadu &
Others v. R.Arivazhagan and another] pertaining to writ appeals which have
been filed by the Government challenging the interim direction of a learned
Single Judge directing the respondents therein / educational authorities to
grant temporary approval to the writ petitioners, who have been appointed as
teachers after 15.11.2011 i.e., after the issuance of G.O.Ms.No.181, School
Education (C2) Department dated 15.11.2011, held as follows:
“42. Accordingly, to meet the ends of justice, the writ
appeals and the writ petitions are disposed with the following
(i) The Teachers herein, who have been appointed
subsequent to the issuance of the Government Order, are
granted one opportunity to appear for the Teacher Eligibility
Test to be conducted by the Teachers Recruitment Board and in
the event of their passing in the Teacher Eligibility Test, their
appointments shall be approved else, they have no other option
but to quit the service/ousted from service;....”
In the aforesaid cases, the Division Bench of this Court has permitted that the
Teachers, who have been appointed subsequent to the issuance of the
Government Order, are granted one opportunity to appear for the TET to be
conducted by the Teachers Recruitment Board and in the event of their
passing in the TET, their appointments shall be approved else, they have no
W.P.Nos.28284, 28287, 28288, 28291 of 2021
other option but to quit the service/ousted from service.
18. In the cases on hand, the contention of the petitioners is that their
appointments were approved by the authorities / Department prior to the
Government Order in G.O.(Ms.)No.181, School Education (C2) Department
dated 15.11.2011 and therefore, it is unreasonable and unfair and on the part
of the educational authorities to insist upon pass in TET for sanction of
increments. It is to be pointed out at this juncture that Section 23 of the RTE
Act, 2009 has initially granted time limit for a period of five years for
completion of TET.           Subsequently, the Ministry of Human Resources
Development, Department of School Education and Literacy, vide Gazette
Notification dated 17.10.2017, in exercise of powers conferred under Section
38 of the RTE Act, made the following amendment to Section 23 of the RTE
"The Right of Children to Free and Compulsory
Education Act, 2009 (Principal Act) was amended by the
Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education
(Amendment) Act, 2017 and a new proviso was inserted in
sub-section (2) of Section 23 of the Principal Act relating to
qualifications for appointment and terms and conditions of
service of teachers. The insered new proviso reads as
"Provided further that every teacher appointed or in
position as on the 31st March 2015, who does not possess
W.P.Nos.28284, 28287, 28288, 28291 of 2021
minimum qualifications as laid down under sub-section (1)
shall acquire such minimum qualification within a period of
four years from the date of commencement of the Right of
Children to Free and Compulsory Education (Amendment)
19. Thereafter, The Principal Secretary to Government, School
Education Department, Government of Tamilnadu / first respondent, vide
D.O. Letter No.2343/MS/2019-1 dated 30.01.2019 addressed to the Ministry
of Human Resource Development, Department of School Education &
Literacy, Government of India, New Delhi, has sough for further extension of
two years for completion of TET.         In response to the same, the Under
Secretary to Government, Ministry of Human Resource Development,
Department of School Education & Literacy has sent a communication to the
first respondent dated 27.02.2019, informing that it would not be possible to
consider any request related to extension of deadline for training of untrained
in-service elementary teachers.        Thereafter, the Principal Secretary to
Government, School Education Department, Chennai-9, vide Letter
No.2343/MS/2019-1 dated 02.05.2019 has issued instruction to Director of
School Education, Elementary Education and Matriculations Schools that
since the Government of India, Ministry of Human Resource Development,
Department of School Education has not extended the time limit, requested to
W.P.Nos.28284, 28287, 28288, 28291 of 2021
take necessary action relating to teachers who have not acquired minimum
qualification as prescribed in Section 23 of RTE Act, 2009 and ensure
compliance and a report on action taken may be sent to the Government
before commencement of the academic year.
20. The fact remains that despite lapse of many years i.e., almost
twelve years after the enactment of RTE Act, 2009, the said statutory
provision has not been complied with, the petitioners and teachers are allowed
to continue in service without possessing the minimum eligibility condition of
pass in TET, as per Section 23 of the RTE Act, 2009 and also as per the RTE
(Amendment Act), 2017.           It is mandatory for the teachers, who did not
possess the minimum qualification of pass in TET prior to RTE Act, 2009 to
acquire the same within the period of nine years i.e., within 31.03.2019.
Thus, the teachers, who do not possess the minimum qualification of pass in
TET are not entitled to continue their service in the schools/educational
institutions.      Therefore, the issue is answered as against the writ
petitioners.
21. Education is a process of acquiring knowledge and skills in general,
W.P.Nos.28284, 28287, 28288, 28291 of 2021
and the field of teachers’ education is special. Quality teachers’ education is
the need of the hour. Effective teaching depends on the teacher with updated
knowledge, skills and technology.              The main purpose of the Teacher
Eligibility Test (TET) is to assess the candidate's aptitude for the profession,
that is, to assess the teachers whether they have adequate teaching
competency and a positive attitude towards teaching or not. The rationale for
including the TET as a minimum eligibility criterion for a person to be
appointed as a teacher is to bring national standards and benchmark for
quality in the recruitment process and to lay special emphasis on teachers’
quality. It is necessary to ensure teachers with the essential aptitude and
ability are recruited to meet the challenges of teaching and for the benefit of
student community at large, the teachers should be competent enough with
national standards. This would ensure that despite alternate pathways open to
become teachers, standards of teaching are maintained.
22. It is one of the contentions of the learned counsel for the petitioners
that as per Clause 11 of the NCTE guidelines dated 11.02.2011, the
appropriate Government should conduct TET at least once in every year, but
the State Government is not conducting TET examination every year,
W.P.Nos.28284, 28287, 28288, 28291 of 2021
therefore, appropriate direction may be given to the State Government to
suitably instruct Teachers Recruitment Board for conducting TET
examination every year, so as to enable the teachers to qualify themselves in
23. In response to the same, Mr.S.Silambanan, learned Additional
Advocate General, on instructions, that Teachers Recruitment Board has
notified for conducting TET examinations in the month of June 2022 and
teachers, who have not qualified themselves in TET, shall participate in the
ensuing TET examinations.
24. Mr.R.Sankaranarayanan, learned Additional Solicitor General, on
instructions, would submit that the extended time limit of further period of
four years as per the RTE (Amendment) Act, 2017, had expired on
31.03.2019 and the Central Government has not considered any request for
further extension of time and would add that only by way of amendment to
Section 23 of the RTE Act, further extension of time can be made and if such
request is mooted out by the State Government, it is for the Central
Government to consider the same.
W.P.Nos.28284, 28287, 28288, 28291 of 2021
25. The claim of the writ petitioners herein is that their appointments
were already approved by the department and now insisting upon them to
pass in TET is totally arbitrary and unreasonable and therefore, the
respondents ought not to have stopped annual increments paid to the
petitioners. The third respondent has clearly stated in the counter affidavit
that since the petitioners do not possess the minimum qualification of pass in
TET as per the guidelines of TET and in the absence of TET, no incentives
can be granted to the petitioners.
26. As discussed above and recording the stand taken by the third
respondents in the counter affidavit and that despite lapse of nearly 12 years
from the date of the notification of the Act, the petitioners did not acquire the
minimum qualification of pass in TET and therefore, in the light of Section 23
of the RTE Act, the petitioners are not entitled to any annual increment and
the relief sought for by the petitioners is liable to be rejected.
W.P.Nos.28284, 28287, 28288, 28291 of 2021
27. In view of the aforesaid reasons and discussions, this Court passes
(i) The relief sought for by the petitioners is rejected.
(ii) The respondents are directed to ensure strict
compliance of the instructions issued by the Principal Secretary
to Government, School Education Department, Chennai-9, vide
Letter No.2343/MS/2019-1 dated 02.05.2019, failing which
appropriate action shall be taken in accordance with law.
(iii) The respondents are also directed to ensure strict
compliance of the Guidelines issued by NCTE dated
11.02.2021, by conducting TET examination once in every
year, so as to enable the teachers to qualify themselves in TET.
(iv) It is open to the first respondent to seek appropriate
remedy before the fifth respondent, if required.
28. These writ petitions stands dismissed with the above directions.
No costs.
