1.           The present juvenile in conflict with law is alleged in FIR No.86 of
31.12.2021, registered at Police Station Sadar Budhlada, District Mansa to
commit offences punishable under Sections 379-B, 427, 511 of the IPC.
2.           Though, the juvenile in conflict with law was amenable for his
delinquent conduct being inquired into by the Juvenile Justice Board concerned,
(hereinafter referred to as “the Board”), but prior to his making his appearance
before the Board concerned, especially given the embodyings in the petition
FIR, rather cognizable, and, non-bailable offences, thereupon he proceeded to
claim the relief of pre-arrest bail, through his moving an apposite application,
before the learned Additional Sessions Judge, Mansa.
3.           The learned Additional Sessions Judge concerned, made a dis-
affirmative order thereon(s). The reason thereof, became grounded in the factum
that, the mandate of Section 438 of Cr.P.C., is available to become re-coursed
only by an accused apprehending his arrest by the police in respect of non-
bailable, and, cognizable offences, and, when Section 12 of the Juvenile Justice
(Care and Protection of Children) Act (hereinafter referred to be as “the Act”),
provisions whereof stands extracted hereinafter, especially sub-Section 1 thereof
carries thereins, the statutory phrase “is apprehended or detained by the police or
appears or brought before a Board”, thereupon he concluded, that the
signification thereof, is that (i) unless there is apprehension of the juvenile in
conflict with law, rather by the police, and, thereafter he makes his appearance,
before the Board, through his production being caused therebefore by the police,
(ii) rather thereupto neither an application under Section 438 of Cr.P.C., is
maintainable nor he becomes empowered to make any affirmative order thereon.
“12. Bail to a person who is apparently a child alleged to be in
conflict with law.-- (1) When any person, who is apparently a child
and is alleged to have committed a bailable or non-bailable offence, is
apprehended or detained by the police or appears or brought before a
Board, such person shall, notwithstanding anything contained in the
Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (2 of 1974) or in any other law for
the time being in force, be released on bail with or without surety or
placed under the supervision of a probation officer or under the care
Provided that such person shall not be so released if there
appears reasonable grounds for believing that the release is likely to
bring that person into association with any known criminal or expose
the said person to moral, physical or psychological danger or the
person’s release would defeat the ends of justice, and the Board shall
record the reasons for denying the bail and circumstances that led to
such a decision.
(2) When such person having been apprehended is not released on
bail under sub-section (1) by the officer-in-charge of the police
station, such officer shall cause the person to be kept only in an
observation home in such manner as may be prescribed until the
person can be brought before a Board.
(3) When such person is not released on bail under sub-section (1) by
the Board, it shall make an order sending him to an observation home
or a place of safety, as the case may be, for such period during the
pendency of the inquiry regarding the person, as may be specified in
the order.
(4) When a child in conflict with law is unable to fulfil the conditions
of bail order within seven days of the bail order, such child shall be
produced before the Board for modification of the conditions of bail.”
4.           Though, the learned Additional Sessions Judge concerned, has for
reasons hereinafter, made an inapt conclusion that, the petition preferred before
him, by the juvenile in conflict with law was not maintainable, but for reasons to
be assigned hereinafter, yet the petitioner can suo motu make his appearance
before the Board concerned, and, irrespective of his committing non-bailable,
and, cognizable offences, whereupon the Board concerned, becomes invested
with the jurisdiction to, not only then, make an order for his becoming released
on bail, rather with or without surety, and/or, to make an order for the juvenile in
conflict with law being placed under supervision of a Probation Officer or under
the care of any fit person. The above made reason becomes grounded in the trite
factum that, a wholesome reading of the all above statutory coinages, as, carried
therein, do in the alternate, to the causings of his coercive production, before the
Board, rather evidently leverage in him the statutory right, to make his suo motu
appearance before the Board, and, such suo motu appearance, is permissible, for
the relevant purpose (supra), even when he is alleged to commit non-bailable,
and, cognizable offences.
5.           The above inference becomes firmly rooted, in the firm factum, that
though through, apposite statutory empowerments, the police can apprehend or
detain the juvenile in conflict with law, and, thereafter may produce him, before
the Board concerned, but yet when the statutory phrase therein “apprehension by
the police”, when becomes yet succeeded by the words “or appears or brought
before a Board”. In sequel, the import of coinage(s) “appears or brought before a
Board”, as occur subsequent to the statutory phrase “apprehension or detention
by the police”, is that, the juvenile in conflict with law, has been preserved an
alternative mode, to his being apprehended or detained, by the police, and,
thereafter his being produced before the Board, inasmuch as, his being bestowed
the statutory latitude of even his suo motu causing his appearance, before the
Board concerned. The above suo motu appearance is an unqualified appearance,
and, is not limited to his appearance, qua only bailable offences, but also
extends qua non-bailable offences, and, cognizable offences, as sub-Section 1 of
Section 12 of the Act (supra), does not make any restrictions qua his suo motu
appearance before any Board, rather appertaining to only qua bailable offences.
Therefore, such appearances extend to, even when he has allegedly committed
non-bailable, and, cognizable offences, and, also bestow in him the statutory
privileges, as become cast thereins.
6.           Though, the juvenile in conflict with law could, upon his becoming
apprehended or arrested by the police, have accessed the Criminal Court of
competent jurisdiction, as become constituted under the Cr.P.C., but yet the
learned Additional Sessions Judge concerned, rather ordered that the apposite
application, as, cast under Section 438 of Cr.P.C., was not maintainable.
However, the above made order is completely infirm, as the learned Additional
Sessions Judge concerned, has over focused, and, has, made an over emphasis,
upon, the coinage “his apprehended or detained, by the police” as occurs in sub-
Section 1 of Section 12 of the Act, and, has concluded that, there is a completest
dire statutory necessity of the juvenile in conflict with law, rather prior to his
availing the mandate of Section 12, rather his becoming necessarily
apprehended or detained by the police, and, obviously only after his
apprehension, rather his becoming well leveraged to avail the statutory remedy
for pre-arrest bail, though his accessing the Board or the Court concerned.
7.           The above made construction to Section 12, is completely mis-
placed, and, arises from a completest mis-understanding, not only, about the
holistic, and, salutary purpose, behind the special enactment, but has also arisen
from the factum, of the completest non-appreciation, and, consequent non-
application, of the statutory import qua the leverage bestowed in law, to the
juvenile in conflict with law, nor has borne in mind the above signification, as,
assigned to the relevant alternate statutory mode, to the police becoming
empowered to apprehend or detain the juvenile in conflict with law, and,
thereafter producing him before the Board concerned, inasmuch as, the juvenile
in conflict with law, becoming empowered to exercise the statutory latitude,
rather through his suo motu making his appearance before the Board concerned,
and, such appearance(s) being limited to not only bailable offences, but also
extending to non-bailable offences, and, cognizable offences.
8.           The learned Additional Sessions Judge concerned, rather in tandem
with the relevant statutory embargo cast, in the SC & ST Act, hence against, the
maintainability of a pre-arrest bail petition in respect of offences therein, has
obviously untenably cast the above embargo, even upon the petitioner. The
above modes of casting of a statutory embargo, upon the petitioner rather
against his, instituting an application for pre-arrest bail, does not only visibly
detract, from the above made signification, to the statutory phrases (supra), but
also defeats the salutary purpose of a child beneficial special Enactment.
Therefore, since the petition offences are non-bailable, and, are cognizable, and,
unless at his instance, to the investigating officer concerned, certain recoveries,
are extremely important, yet they can be ensured to be made, to the investigating
officer concerned, but in the presence of the Special Investigator concerned,
rather for ensuring that, the salutary purpose carried, in the proviso underneath
sub-Section 1 of Section 12 of the Act, is rendered not redundant, especially
when without the Special Investigator, he faces the investigating officer
concerned, there may be every likelihood of his mindset, being etched with a
deep trauma, for obviations whereof, the proviso is meant.
9.           Be that as it may, if the juvenile in conflict with law suo motu
makes his appearance before the Board concerned, and, his appearance, is also,
in respect of the petition offences, which may be non-bailable in nature,
thereupon the said appearance of the juvenile in conflict with law, before the
Board, would be deemed to be his making his constructive custody, before the
Board concerned, and, if the above suo motu appearance of the juvenile in
conflict, with law, is deemed to be his constructive custody, with the Board
concerned. Therefore as enshrined in sub-Section 1 of Section 12 of the Act, the
juvenile in conflict with law, becomes empowered to claim his being released,
on bail with or without surety, and,/or, claim qua his being placed, under the
supervision of a Probation Officer or under the care of any fit person. The
inference (supra), also applies with alike force, qua the learned Additional
Sessions Judge concerned, especially when he without being coercively
detained, rather his appearance before him, is deemed to his constructive
custody before him, and, as such, his petition was maintainable.
10.          Even though, as above stated, the police has lawful authorization(s)
to apprehend or detain a juvenile in conflict with law, but the statutory coinage,
as occur subsequent thereto inasmuch as, “or appears” when read combinedly
with the preceding thereto empowerment, as, vested in the police, rather does
galvanize a conclusion, that the alternative thereto suo motu leverage, conferred,
upon the juvenile in conflict with law, is not ideally made nor is thoughtlessly
made, but is made with a deep legislative intent, as well as, is, beneficial to the
juvenile in conflict with law, whereupon the legislature intent is to be revered.
The legislative intent, is that, only in respect of the most heinous offences
committed by the juvenile in conflict with law, and, with evident complicity
with an adult accused, who are to be tried before the jurisdictionally empowered
Court, as constituted under the Cr.P.C., then may be, the police may lawfully
exercise the statutory discretion, of theirs apprehending or detaining a juvenile
in conflict with law, but if the offences committed by the juvenile in conflict
with law, are not heinous or grave, inasmuch as, theirs, not entailing punishment
of life imprisonment, but entailing only punishment of a lesser term, thereupon
even if such offences, are non-bailable, then may be the police may not arrest,
nor, apprehend juvenile in conflict with law, and, in that event the juvenile in
conflict with law, can well choose the statutorily assigned mode, qua his suo
motu making his appearance before the Board, and, to thereafter claim, for his
being ordered to be released on bail. Moreover even when he seeks relief of pre-
arrest bail from the jurisdictionally empowered Court, thereupon as, above
stated, his appearance before the Court, is to be construed to be his making his
surrender therebefore, or is to be deemed to be his being in the constructive
custody of the Board concerned, and, of the Court concerned. In consequence
the relevant motions, before the Board, and/or, the Court, do leverage in him the
right to claim the apposite statutory privilege.
11.           Bearing in mind that non-bailable offences, become committed, by
the juvenile in conflict with law, but since they do not entail the imposition,
upon him of punishment of life imprisonment, and, also when even upon, the
concerned, being tried along with an adult accused concerned, yet when then
also, the mandate of Section 18 of the Act, provisions whereof stands extracted
hereinafter, do not permit, the judicial incarceration of the juvenile in conflict
with law, but rather contemplate(s), that the juvenile in conflict with law, rather
being sent to a Children's Home, Therefore, the holistic purpose of the Act, is to
save the juvenile in conflict with law, from the agony, and, trauma of judicial
incarceration. In consequence, on the above analogy, any pre-trial detention of
the petitioner, especially in police custody, is to be saved, as, and, when deemed
fit, as the above ill event would entail moral, physical or psychological danger to
the framework, of the juvenile in conflict with law, and, would militate against
the spirit of the salutary provision(s), as become encapsulated in the special
“18. Orders regarding child found to be in conflict with law.-- (1)
Where a Board is satisfied on inquiry that a child irrespective of age
has committed a petty offence, or a serious offence, or a child below
the age of sixteen years has committed a heinous offence, then,
notwithstanding anything contrary contained in any other law for the
time being in force, and based on the nature of offence, specific need
for supervision or intervention, circumstances as brought out in the
social investigation report and past conduct of the child, the Board
may, if it so thinks fit,—
(a) allow the child to go home after advice or admonition by
following appropriate inquiry and counselling to such child and
to his parents or the guardian;
(b) direct the child to participate in group counselling and
(c) order the child to perform community service under the
supervision of an organisation or institution, or a specified
person, persons or group of persons identified by the Board;
(d) order the child or parents or the guardian of the child to pay
Provided that, in case the child is working, it may be
ensured that the provisions of any labour law for the time being
in force are not violated;
(e) direct the child to be released on probation of good conduct
and placed under the care of any parent, guardian or fit person,
on such parent, guardian or fit person executing a bond, with
or without surety, as the Board may require, for the good
behaviour and child’s well-being for any period not exceeding
(f) direct the child to be released on probation of good conduct
and placed under the care and supervision of any fit facility for
ensuring the good behaviour and child’s well-being for any
period not exceeding three years;
(g) direct the child to be sent to a special home, for such period,
not exceeding three years, as it thinks fit, for providing
reformative services including education, skill development,
counselling, behaviour modification therapy, and psychiatric
support during the period of stay in the special home:
Provided that if the conduct and behaviour of the child
has been such that, it would not be in the child’s interest, or in
the interest of other children housed in a special home, the
Board may send such child to the place of safety.
(2) If an order is passed under clauses (a) to (g) of sub-section (1), the
Board may, in addition pass orders to—
(iv) prohibit the child from visiting, frequenting or appearing at
(v) undergo a de-addiction programme.
(3) Where the Board after preliminary assessment under section 15
pass an order that there is a need for trial of the said child as an
adult, then the Board may order transfer of the trial of the case to the
Children’s Court having jurisdiction to try such offences.”
12.          In the wake of the above, and, irrespective of this Court, quashing
the impugned order, thereupon, this Court reserves liberty to the juvenile in
conflict with law, to suo motu cause his appearance, before the Board concerned,
and, such appearance shall be deemed to be his surrender, before the Board
concerned, and, also his constructive custody, or his deemed custody, before the
Board concerned, which shall if satisfied, that the report of the Social
Investigator, does not cause breach the proviso to sub-Section 1 of Section 12 of
the Act, shall in accordance with law, grant him bail with or without surety, or
shall proceed to make such lawful orders, as deemed fit.
13.           In consequence, with the above liberty to the juvenile in conflict
with law, to make his suo motu appearance before the Board, whereupon, the
Board concerned, shall forthwith invite the social investigation report, with
respect to the juvenile in conflict with law, and, appertaining qua if admitted to
bail, he would not be exposed to moral, physical or psychological danger, and, if
a report dis-affirmative, to the juvenile, in conflict with law, yet is made, by the
Social Investigator concerned, thereupon, the Board concerned, may make an
order, in accordance with law, qua the juvenile in conflict with law, being put
under the supervision of a Probation Officer or under the care of any fit person.
14.           Petition is disposed of with above observations.
