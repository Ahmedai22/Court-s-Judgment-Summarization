Aggrieved by the said order dated 20.10.2020, the National

Taking into account the then existing situation of the Pandemic,
this Court issued notice on 29.10.2020 and stayed the directions
(i), (ii) and (iv) given in para 7 of the impugned order of the
High Court dated 20.10.2020. Thereafter, the interim order was
continued from time to time. The last extension was granted on
21.1.2021   whereby    the    interim    order    was    extended    till
In the meanwhile, by an Order dated 18.02.2021, the High
Court was informed about the recommendations made by the High
Powered Committee on 17.02.2021 by which the prisoners    who were
released due to orders of the interim bail were directed to
surrender.    The High Court directed the extension of interim
bail  granted   to  3499 under trial  prisoners   expiring   w.e.f.
20.02.2021 for a period of 15 days when their respective interim
bails were to expire.
In  view    of  the improving  situation,   we   direct   2318
prisoners who were granted interim bail by the trial Court and
356 prisoners who were granted interim bail by the High Court to
surrender within 15 days from today.
