1.           This order will dispose of two petitions bearing Public
Interest Litigation (PIL) No. 2129 of 2017 and Writ - C No. 27122 of
2.            Challenge in this Public Interest Litigation is to the
Government Orders dated 21.12.2016 and 22.12.2016, whereby
members of certain ‘Other Backward Castes’ were sought to be
declared as Scheduled Castes. This has been done by saying that it is a
clarification and is not meant to specify them as Scheduled Castes as
done under Article 341 of the Constitution. Additionally, in Writ - C
No. 27122 of 2019, challenge is to the subsequent Government Order
issued by the State on 24.06.2019 to the same effect.
3.            The order dated 21st December, 2016 provides differently.
It is mentioned in that order that members of the Scheduled Caste,
Majhwar, mentioned at Serial No. 53 of the Constitution (Scheduled
Castes) Order, 1950, as amended by the Order of 1976 are not being
issued Scheduled Caste Certificate treating them to be a member of
‘Other Backward Classes’, such as Godia, Mallah etc. It is further
recorded that adversely affected persons had approached this Court
vide Writ Petition No. 4568 of 2007, Ajay Kumar and others v. State
of U.P. and others, decided on 30.03.2016, wherein a direction was
issued to the Commissioner to look into the matter and pass
appropriate orders.
4.            The Divisional Appellate Forum, Faizabad on 30.09.2016
had issued directions to provide members of the Majhwar Caste,
Scheduled Caste Certificates. There are then instructions carried in the
order dated 21st December, 2016, providing that before issue of
3            WPIL No. 2129 of 2017
Scheduled Caste Certificates in accordance with the Government
Order dated 09.07.2015, the ascertainment of the person’s caste is to
be substantially made and not merely on the basis of the caste title
used in the name or the avocation he pursues. There are detailed
directions to undertake this inquiry at the local and the family level by
officials, including ascertainment of the fact from the educational
institutions besides documents, locally available.
5.            So far as order dated 21st December, 2016 is concerned, it
does not add or introduce any caste as a Scheduled Caste to the
Constitution (Scheduled Castes) Order, 1950 issued by the President
of India in exercise of powers under Article 341 of the Constitution.
All that the order says is that members of the Caste Majhwar, whose
Entry Number is 53 in the Scheduled Castes Order should be issued
the necessary certificates after verification of their status. Members of
this caste should not be confused with Other Backward Classes, such
as Godia, Mallah etc. and refused their Scheduled Caste Certificate.
6.            We do not find any illegality in the order dated 21 st
7.            So far as the Government Order dated 22nd December,
2016 is concerned, it clearly recognizes or acknowledges 17 Other
Backward Classes as Scheduled Castes in the name of clarification. In
whatever manner said, 17 Castes, that are otherwise in the category of
O.B.C., have been recognized by the order dated 22 nd December, 2016
4             WPIL No. 2129 of 2017
as Scheduled Castes in the State of Uttar Pradesh. This cannot be done
in view of the provisions of Article 341 of the Constitution, which
(1)      The President may with respect to any State or
Union territory, and where it is a State, after consultation
with the Governor thereof, by public notification, specify
the castes, races or tribes or parts of or groups within
castes, races or tribes which shall for the purposes of this
Constitution be deemed to be Scheduled Castes in
relation to that State or Union territory, as the case may
(2)    Parliament may by law include in or exclude from
the list of Scheduled Castes specified in a notification
issued under clause (1) any caste, race or tribe or part of
or group within any caste, race or tribe, but save as
aforesaid a notification issued under the said clause shall
not be varied by any subsequent notification.”
8.          The Constitution (Scheduled Castes) Order, 1950 alone
can specify which castes, races or tribes or groups within castes, races
or tribes, shall be regarded as Scheduled Castes under the
Constitution, in relation to a particular State or a Union Territory. The
Constitution (Scheduled Castes) Order has to be made by the
President of India. Under Article 341(2), any change to the list of
Scheduled Castes specified in the President’s order can only be made
by Parliament by law. A parliamentary law alone can include in or
5            WPIL No. 2129 of 2017
exclude from the list of the Constitution (Scheduled Castes) Order,
1950, as amended in 1976, a particular caste. The order to be made by
the President, which has been described under Article 341 as a
notification is insulated from any kind of variation by a subsequent
notification, even by the President. The only variation that can be
done is by a parliamentary enactment, not otherwise.
9.           Article 341 of the Constitution that applies to Scheduled
Castes is para materia to Article 342, which provides in identical
terms with regard to the Scheduled Tribes. The question fell for
consideration of the Supreme Court recently in State of Maharashtra
and another v. Keshao Vishwanath Sonone and another, 2020
SCC OnLine SC 1040, where it was held:
59.        This Court after noticing the constitutional
provisions held that it is not possible to say that State
Governments or any other authority or courts or tribunals
are vested with any power to modify or vary the
Scheduled Tribes Orders. This Court also held that no
enquiry is permissible and no evidence can be let in for
establishing that a particular caste or part or group within
tribes or tribe is included in Presidential Order if they are
not expressly included. In paragraph 12, following has
appears that the object of clause (1) of Articles 341
and 342 was to keep away disputes touching
whether       a   caste/tribe   is    a    Scheduled
Caste/Scheduled Tribe or not for the purpose of the
Constitution. Whether a particular caste or a tribe
is Scheduled Caste or Scheduled Tribe as the case
may be, within the meaning of the entries
contained in the Presidential Orders issued under
clause (1) of Articles 341 and 342, is to be
determined looking to them as they are. Clause (2)
of the said articles does not permit any one to seek
modification of the said orders by leading evidence
that the caste/Tribe (A) alone is mentioned in the
Order but caste/Tribe (B) is also a part of
caste/Tribe (A) and as such caste/Tribe (B) should
be deemed to be a Scheduled Caste/Scheduled
Tribe as the case may be. It is only Parliament that
is competent to amend the Orders issued under
Articles 341 and 342. As can be seen from the
entries in the schedules pertaining to each State
whenever one caste/tribe has another name it is so
mentioned in the brackets after it in the schedules.
In this view it serves no purpose to look at
gazetteers or glossaries for establishing that a
particular     caste/tribe     is    a    Scheduled
Caste/Scheduled      Tribe   for  the   purpose    of
Constitution, even though it is not specifically
mentioned as such in the Presidential Orders.
Orders once issued under clause (1) of the said
articles, cannot be varied by subsequent order or
notification even by the President except by law
made by Parliament. Hence it is not possible to say
that State Governments or any other authority or
courts or Tribunals are vested with any power to
7            WPIL No. 2129 of 2017
modify or vary the said Orders. If that be so, no
inquiry is permissible and no evidence can be let in
for establishing that a particular caste or part or
group within tribes or tribe is included in
Presidential Order if they are not expressly
included in the Orders. Since any exercise or
attempt to amend the Presidential Order except as
provided in clause (2) of Articles 341 and 342
would be futile, holding any inquiry or letting in
any evidence in that regard is neither permissible
nor useful.”
60.    The Constitution Bench reiterated that the power to
include or exclude, amend or alter the Presidential Order
is expressly and exclusively conferred on and vested with
the Parliament and Courts cannot and should not extend
jurisdiction to deal with the question as to whether a
particular caste or sub-caste or group or part of tribe is
included in any one of the entries mentioned in the
Presidential Order. Following was laid down in
“15. Thus it is clear that States have no power to
amend Presidential Orders. Consequently, a party
in power or the Government of the day in a State is
relieved from the pressure or burden of tinkering
with the Presidential Orders either to gain
popularity or secure votes. Number of persons in
order to gain advantage in securing admissions in
educational institutions and employment in State
services have been claiming as belonging to either
Scheduled Castes or Scheduled Tribes depriving
8            WPIL No. 2129 of 2017
genuine and needy persons belonging to Scheduled
Castes and Scheduled Tribes covered by the
Presidential Orders, defeating and frustrating to a
large extent the very object of protective
discrimination given to such people based on their
educational and social backwardness. Courts
cannot and should not expand jurisdiction to deal
with the question as to whether a particular caste,
sub-caste; a group or part of tribe or sub-tribe is
included in any one of the entries mentioned in the
Presidential Orders issued under Articles 341 and
342 particularly so when in clause (2) of the said
article, it is expressly stated that the said Orders
cannot be amended or varied except by law made
by Parliament. The power to include or exclude,
amend or alter Presidential Order is expressly and
exclusively     conferred   on   and    vested   with
Parliament and that too by making a law in that
regard. The President had the benefit of consulting
the States through Governors of States which had
the means and machinery to find out and
recommend as to whether a particular caste or tribe
was to be included in the Presidential Order. If the
said Orders are to be amended, it is Parliament that
is in a better position to know having the means
and machinery unlike courts as to why a particular
caste or tribe is to be included or excluded by law
to be made by Parliament. Allowing the State
Governments or courts or other authorities or
Tribunals to hold inquiry as to whether a particular
caste or tribe should be considered as one included
9           WPIL No. 2129 of 2017
in the schedule of the Presidential Order, when it is
not so specifically included, may lead to
problems………………………………….”
61.     It is further to be noticed that Constitution Bench
in Milind's case (supra) has noted the ratio of earlier two
Constitution Bench judgments in B. Basavalingappa's
case and Bhaiya Lal's case and in paragraph 28 has
reaffirmed the ration of above two Constitution Bench
judgments. In paragraph 28, following is laid down:—
“28. Being in respectful agreement, we reaffirm
the ratio of the two Constitution Bench judgments
aforementioned and state in clear terms that no
inquiry at all is permissible and no evidence can be
let in, to find out and decide that if any tribe or
tribal community or part of or group within any
tribe or tribal community is included within the
scope and meaning of the entry concerned in the
Presidential Order when it is not so expressly or
specifically included. Hence, we answer Question
1 in the negative.”
62.     In view of the ratio of judgments of this Court as
noticed above, the conclusion is inescapable that the
High Court could not have entertained the claim or
looked into the evidences to find out and decide that tribe
“Gowari” is part of Scheduled Tribe “Gond Gowari”,
which is included in the Constitution (Scheduled Tribes)
Order, 1950. It is further clear that there is no conflict in
the ratio of Constitution Bench judgments of this Court in
B. Basavalingappa's case and State of Maharashtra v.
Milind (supra). The ratio of B. Basavalingappa's case as
10             WPIL No. 2129 of 2017
noted in paragraph 6 of the judgment and extracted above
is reiterated by subsequent two Constitution Bench
judgments in Bhaiya Lal's case and Milind's case. There
being no conflict in the ratio of the above Three
Constitution Bench judgments, we do not find any
substance in submission of Shri Rohatgi that for
resolving the conflict, the matter need to be referred to a
larger Constitution Bench. We, thus, answer question
Nos. 1 and 2 in following words:—
(i) The High Court in the writ petition giving rise
to these appeals could not have entertained the
claim of a caste “Gowari” that it be declared a
Scheduled Tribe as “Gond Gowari” included at
Entry No. 18 of the Constitution (Scheduled
Tribes) Order, 1950 nor High Court could have
taken evidence to adjudicate the above claim.
(ii) There is no conflict in the ratio of the judgment
of    Constitution   Bench      of    this   Court  in
Basavalingappa's case and Milind's case.
10.          In the light of the aforesaid enunciation of law by
Hon’ble the Supreme Court of India, the learned Advocate General
could not defend the impugned order.
11.          Though in Keshao Vishwanath Sonone’s case (supra),
the issue was whether the High Court in a writ petition could examine
the claim of a Caste to be included in the Schedule Tribes, which was
not included in the Constitution (Scheduled Castes) Order, 1950, their
Lordships restated the law laid down by the earlier Constitution Bench
11        WPIL No. 2129 of 2017
decision in B. Basavalingappa v. D. Munichinnappa, AIR 1965 SC
1269, Bhaiya Lal v. Harikishan Singh, AIR 1965 SC 1557 and
State of Maharashtra v. Milind and others, (2001) 1 SCC 4. The
provisions of Article 341 of the Constitution do not leave any scope
for including any Caste or Group to the list of Scheduled Caste in a
State provided by the Constitution (Scheduled Castes) Order, 1950,
except by law made by Parliament.
12.          In this view of the matter, the orders dated 22.12.2016
and 24.06.2019 are hereby quashed. The writ petition is allowed to the
extent mentioned above.
13.          All pending impleadment applications are disposed of.
Whether the order is speaking :       Yes�/No
Whether the order is reportable :       Yes/No
