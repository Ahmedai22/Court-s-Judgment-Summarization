As we are inclined to pass an order of remand to the High
Court, we need not refer to the facts in detail.
The impugned order by the High Court of Judicature at Madras
in Criminal Revision No. 1516/2013 enhances the sentences imposed
on   the   appellants      for   offences    under   Sections   341,    294(b),
506(ii) and 447 of the Indian Penal Code. It is noticed, however,
that the appellants though served notice, no legal representation
was made on their behalf. In such a situation, the High court
ought   to   have    appointed     an  Amicus   Curiae   in  the   absence   of
counsel    as   observed     by   this   Court   in   Parveen   v.   State   of
Haryana.1   It    is   to   be  noted   that   the   judgment  and   order   of
sentence passed by the Court of Principal Sessions Judge, Vellore
District     dated     4th   December     2006   was    challenged     by   the
victim/revision        petitioner     in    the    aforementioned     criminal
revision filed in 2013. The delay was condoned on 13th December
1 Order dated 16th November 2020 in Criminal Appeal Nos.750-751 of 2020
2013. Thereupon, the revision petition remained pending and had
come up for hearing after almost five years on 24th October 2018,
when the impugned order was passed. The impugned order mentions
that the notice has been served to the appellants herein and
their names have been printed in the cause list but there was no
representation on their behalf. There is lack of clarity on when
the notice was actually served and whether the appellants were
informed that the criminal revision will be taken up for final
hearing.    Therefore,   it   appears   the  ex   parte   enhancement  of
sentence    is   against   the   statutory    mandate   of   the  law  as
delineated in the conjoint reading of Section 401(1) and first
proviso to Section 386 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973.
These sections adumbrate an opportunity of showing cause before
enhancement of sentence in criminal revision. This opportunity,
as held in Govind Ramji Jadhav v. State of Maharashtra,2 mandates
that   the   High   Court   should   give   the  accused    a  reasonable
opportunity of showing cause. Be that as it may, it is apparent
that it is only the counsel for the petitioner and the State were
heard. The court did not have the benefit of the arguments on
behalf of the Appellants. In the given fact, in our opinion, the
High Court was wrong in not appointing an Amicus Curiae. This
being an accepted and admitted position, we quash and set aside
the impugned order dated 24.10.2018 with an order of remand to
the High Court to decide the revision petition afresh and in
accordance with law.
We clarify that we have not expressed any opinion on merits.
Appellants  as  well  as  respondents  are  directed  to appear
before the High Court on 17th December, 2021, when the date of
hearing will be fixed. Separate notice is not required to be
The appellants would continue to remain on bail on the bonds
furnished by them pursuant to order dated 13.11.2019 passed by
this Court. However, the High Court would be at liberty to call
upon the appellants to execute fresh bail bonds on the terms and
conditions to be fixed by the Court.
With the aforesaid directions, the appeal is partly allowed
and disposed of.
All pending applications are disposed of.
