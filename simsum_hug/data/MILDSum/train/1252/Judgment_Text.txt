What falls for consideration in the subject writ petition is,
“Integrity and bodily freedom of a woman, the wife, being
ravaged by the husband, whether, could be absolved and
protected    by    a   law   that   mandates     equality     of  its
What pervades the entire petition is, “wanton lust,
vicious appetite, depravity of senses, loathsome beast of
passion, unbridled unleashing of carnal desire of demonish
perversion”. It is these that drove the complainant-wife to
register   a  complaint     against   the  husband     for   offences
punishable, inter alia, under Sections 376 and 377 of the Indian
Penal Code. Cognizance being taken against the husband for the
rape of his wife, is what drives the accused-husband, to this
2. FACTUAL EXPOSE’ as borne out from the pleadings are
The petitioner- accused No.1 in Spl.C.C.No.356/2017 gets
married    to   the  complainant    -  Mrs.Bratati    @  Pinky   on
20.06.2006, at Bhuvaneshwar.        The couple stayed at various
parts of the nation and at the relevant point in time, he was
working at Bangalore and have also a child born out of their
wedlock.    After few years of living together, relationship of the
couple gets horribly strained. Many instances of physical and
mental torture to the wife and the child led to the complainant-
wife registering a complaint against the husband on 21.03.2017.
The complaint becomes an FIR in Crime No.13/2017 for offences
punishable under Sections 506, 498A, 323, 377 of the Indian
Penal Code (‘IPC’ for short) and Section 10 of the Protection of
Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012 (‘POCSO Act’ for short).
3. The Police, after investigation, have filed a charge sheet
against the petitioner. While filing the charge sheet, the offences
punishable under Sections 498A, 354, 376, 506 of the IPC and
Sections 5(m) and (l) r/w Section 6 of the POCSO Act, 2012, are
invoked.    The case is now registered as Spl.C.C.No.356/2017.
The parents of the petitioner along with the petitioner were also
charge sheeted as accused Nos.2 and 3 and have been
discharged pursuant to an order passed by this Court in
Crl.P.No.423/2018 disposed on 03.07.2018. Therefore, the trial
is now to be conducted only against the petitioner-husband of
the complainant.
4. On filing of the charge sheet, the Special Court framed
charges against the petitioner alone in terms of its order dated
10.08.2018, for offences punishable under Sections 376, 498A
and 506 of IPC and Section 5(m) and (l) r/w Section 6 of the
POCSO Act. It is at that juncture, the petitioner has knocked
the doors of this Court in the subject criminal petition seeking
Wherefore, the Petitioner (accused No.1) most
humbly prays that this Hon’ble Court be pleased to issue a
Writ of Certiorari or a Writ of appropriate nature or orders
(a) Declare that Sections 29 and 30 of the POCSO Act
is unconstitutional being violation of Articles 14, 19 and 21
of the Constitution.
(b) To quash the entire proceedings pending in
Spl.C.C.No.356/2017 on the file of Hon’ble L Additional
City Civil and Sessions and Special Court for Cases under
POCSO Act, Bangalore City as per ANNEXURE – ‘A’ as an
abuse of process of Law.
(c) Grant such other relief or reliefs as this Hon’ble
Court deems fit to grant, in the ends of justice.”
5. Heard Sri. Hashmath Pasha, the learned senior counsel
appearing for the petitioner-husband, Smt.Namitha Mahesh,
learned     Additional      Government        Advocate      representing
respondent No.1-State, Sri Sri.A.D.Ramananda, learned counsel
appearing for the complainant-wife, Sri.Shanthi Bhushan,
learned Assistant Solicitor General of India representing the
Central Government.         The respective counsel has made the
6. The learned senior counsel Sri Hashmath Pasha would
(i)   The presumption under Sections 29 and 30 of the
POCSO Act is unconstitutional as it imposes a
reverse burden of proving innocence on a
presumption that the accused is a lady. According to
him this concept is unknown to criminal
jurisprudence.
(ii)  Even if it is presumed that the burden casts upon the
prosecution to prove the foundational facts beyond
all reasonable doubt the FIR did not contain the
offence alleged against the petitioner for the offence
punishable under Section 376 of the IPC.
(iii) FIR that was registered was for offence punishable
under Section 377 of the IPC while the police filed
their final report/charge sheet invoking Section 376
and the learned Sessions Judge takes cognizance of
the offence.
(iv)  It is his defense against the allegation that the wife,
the complainant had in fact extra marital affairs
which led to all the problems between the couple.
There is no instance narrated in the complaint that
would touch upon the offence punishable under
Section 498A of IPC.
(v)   In so far as allegations under the POSCO Act is
concerned, the learned senior counsel would contend
that there was no basis to frame the charge under
Section 5(1)(m)(L) r/w Section 6 of the POSCO Act as
there was no medical evidence as to the commission
of any of those offences under those sections. He
would submit that CW-2 doctor has categorically
opined that there was no penile penetration.
(vi)  The learned senior counsel would submit that what
is urged against the petitioner insofar as it concerns
the wife is offences under Sections 498A, 376, 377
and other allied offences. What is alleged against the
petitioner insofar it concerns the daughter is under
the POSCO Act. Both the offences being definite and
Courts jurisdiction to try these offences being distinct
both cannot be tried in the same Court which is now
being tried as the designated Court is to try the
offence under the POSCO Act.
7. The learned Assistant Solicitor General who represents
Union of India/2nd respondent has vehemently refuted these
contentions and placed reliance upon several judgments to
contend that the plea of challenge to the presumption has been
considered and negatived by the Apex Court and this Court in
several judgments.       Therefore, such a plea would not be
available to the petitioner. If that is not available, there is
nothing other than that the Union Government needs to answer
in the lis.
8. The learned counsel representing the complainant Sri
D.Ramanand would vehemently refute the submissions made by
the learned senior counsel and would contend the following:
(i)   The foundational facts are already placed by the
prosecution before the Court and for it to prove
beyond reasonable doubt the trial has not yet
commenced.
(ii)  On one pretext or the other the petitioner has been
moving the Court on umpteen number of occasion
and has not allowed the trial to commence.
(iii) He would submit that the allegations being as what
is noticed in the complaint or subsequent
communications of both the mother and daughter,
the petitioner is a beast in the form of a man and
should not be shown any indulgence at the hands of
this Court and the trial should be permitted to
commence.
(iv)  He would submit that the learned Sessions Judge
has rightly taken cognizance of the offence
punishable under Section 376 of the IPC as the facts
clearly reveal that the petitioner had sex every time
with the complainant torturing and abusing her
against her consent and forcibly had his lust fulfilled.
(v)   In the peculiar facts of this case though exception to
Section 375 protects the husband such protection
should not be given in the case at hand. He would
submit that the writ petition should be dismissed.
(vi)  The Sessions Court has erred in not acceding for
addition of a charge to include offences punishable
under Section 377 of IPC against the petitioner.
9.   The    learned    Additional    Government    Advocate
Smt. Namitha Mahesh representing the 1st respondent would toe
the lines of submissions of the learned counsel appearing for the
2nd respondent and would submit that since the husband is
exempted from the allegation of Section 375 of the IPC, even if
the facts warrant, it is for this Court to consider the same in the
light of the exception. But she would submit that it is a matter
for trial.
10. In reply to all the aforesaid submissions of the
respective learned counsel for the respondents, the learned
senior counsel for the petitioner would submit and accept that
no doubt presumption under Sections 29 and 30 of the POSCO
Act and their constitutionality has been considered and upheld
in several judgments, but that would not mean that the
foundational facts need not be proved beyond all reasonable
11. I have     given my anxious consideration to the
submissions made by the learned senior counsel Mr. Hashmath
Pasha and other respective learned counsel and perused the
material on record.
12. In the light of the submissions made by the respective
learned counsel, the following points arise for my consideration:
(i)   Whether cognizance being taken against the
petitioner-husband for offence punishable under
(ii)  Whether the allegation against the petitioner for
(iii) Whether the prosecution notwithstanding the
presumption under Sections 29 and 30 of the Act
has to prove the foundational facts beyond all
(iv)  Whether the designated Court to try the offences
under the Act has jurisdiction to try both the
offences under the IPC and the Act in the facts of
(v)   Whether    chargesheet       against    the   petitioner
should be altered to include addition of the
offence punishable under Section 377 of IPC?
(vi)  Whether    proceedings       under    the  POCSO     Act
against the petitioner needs to be interfered
ACTUAL EXPOSE’ as discernible from the facts:
13. The facts with regard to marriage and other allegations
being not in dispute are not reiterated. The alleged offences
resulting in proceedings under the IPC insofar as it concerns the
wife and the offence under the Act insofar as it concerns the
daughter, is the issue in the lis, I, therefore, deem it appropriate
to consider the points that have arisen insofar as they concern
the offences against the wife at the outset.
Whether cognizance being taken against the
petitioner-husband       for   offence     punishable     under
14. To consider this issue, it is germane to notice what
drove the complainant to register the complaint and what drives
the petitioner-accused No.1 to this Court. The entire issue
springs from the complaint registered by the wife alleging
commission of brutal sexual acts by the husband against her, as
also, sexual abuses against the child.         It therefore becomes
necessary to notice the complaint and its ghastly narration. The
“Sub: Complaint against Mr.Hrushikesh,
Mrs.Shakunthala and Mr.Jaganath Sahoo
All are R/at K.P.C. Layout, S.R.S.Residency,
Bengaluru – 560 035, for assault, Criminal

minor 9 years daughter Kumari. Kiran by Mr.
Hrushikesh who is biological father of Kumari. Kiran.
cognizance of my complaint with a request to conceal
my name and my daughter’s name in the public
domain for the reasons stated hereunder:
1.    I am a native of Orissa when I was two years
old my father expired in a road accident and I
do not recollect his name. I have studied upto
12th standard.
Mr.Hrushikesh who is the only son to his
parents Mrs.Shakunthala and Mr.Jaganath
Sahoo. I got married to Mr.Hurshikesh and I
do not want to remember the date where my
life was in hell.
3.    My husband had repeatedly accused me
complaint to Vanitha Sahayavani and for the
first time I took assistance of my relative to
Advocate that the person who had called
sex and I am sleeping with my daughter.
I did not go to the Commissioner office as I
know that my husband will be telling lies that
I will not give him sex and I sleep with my
daughter which he had repeatedly complained
to everyone including my mother, uncle and all
known persons to me.
4.    I was victimized to become a sex slave to
Mr.Hrushikesh. On detail counseling of my
Lawyer and his wife for the first time I got
courage to voice out my pains. I had written
harassed by Mr.Hrushikesh, Mrs.Shakunthala
and Mr.Jaganath Sahoo to get money from
disposing my ancestral property worth Rs.1
crore and compelled my daughter Kiran to be
Mrs.Shakunthala and Mr.Jaganath Sahoo
both held my daughter’s hair and twisted her
hand. My husband Mr.Hrushikesh broke my
fingers. As the neighbouring flat owners came
on hearing our screams, my husband and my
in-laws let us go. I have collected some pen
drives of my husband and hearing the false
accusation that I had beaten by my husband
to the neighbours. Out of fear of death and
harassment I have rushed to my Advocate
Polyclinic where his client Dr.Mir Iftekhar Ali
consultation. I had taken first aid and rushed
back to Lawyer’s office to complete the
problems. The details of the question and
answers to which I recorded the question and
simultaneously.    The written question and
answer of my daughter is enclosed along with
this complaint.
5. I was literally in pain of understanding the
husband Mr.Hrushikesh and I had written my
pains in a separate letter addressed to my
Advocate and his wife and the copy of the
same is herewith enclosed along with this
complaint.
6.     I have become a sex slave to my husband
compelled and forced to have unnatural
continue with sex even after my baby got
terminated.
7.     My husband is totally an inhuman and he
forced me to perform all unnatural sex in
front of my daughter and many occasions
harassment which no female in the world
and my daughter’s name in the complaint to
be undisclosed and punish my husband. I
am terrible in untold pains from knowing
daughter have suffered.
I, therefore kindly request you to offer social security
by immediately offering rehabilitation for both me
and my daughter and punish my husband and in-
laws for all the injustice caused to me and my
daughter.”
This is the genesis of the issue before the competent Court.
After registration of the complaint for offences under Sections
498A, 377, 354 and 506 read with the provisions of the Act as
quoted hereinabove, investigation was conducted into the
matter. After investigation, the Police have filed their final
report/charge sheet. The summary of the allegations while filing

The charge sheet filed by the Police after investigation (supra)
also depicts graphic details of the demonish lust of accused No.1
who even according to the investigation has had unnatural sex;
every time has sexual intercourse torturing or abusing the wife,
or threatening to beat the daughter or beating the daughter, all
for satisfaction of the gory carnal lust.
15. It is in the teeth of the aforesaid discovery during
investigation, the charge sheet is filed by the Police for offences
punishable under Sections 498A, 376, 354, 506 of the IPC and
Section 5(m) and (l) of the Act. The petitioner, on filing of the
final report, files an application under Section 216 of the Cr.P.C.
seeking a prayer to drop the first charge framed under Section
376 of the IPC, as the offence would not get attracted in the case
of the petitioner who is the husband of the complainant. This
application seeking dropping of the said charge is rejected by the
Sessions Court in terms of its order dated 16-10-2018. It is then
the petitioner knocks the doors of this Court in the subject
petition in the garb of calling in question the Constitutional
validity of clauses of presumption under Sections 29 and 30 of
16. During the pendency of the proceedings before the
Sessions Court, the complainant/wife has further addressed
communications to all quarters seeking help and in the
narration again has clearly indicated as to how brutal the
petitioner used to have sex, anal sex with the complainant/wife
in the presence of his daughter who was 9 years old at that point
in time and later used to touch the private parts of the daughter
and also indulged in sexual acts against the daughter. The
communications that are made or voluntary letters written by
both the wife and daughter are so chilling and abhorrent that
they cannot be reproduced in the order. The issue with regard
to daughter which comes under the Act will be dealt with, by me
a little later. It is now time in the journey of this order to
consider whether cognizance taken and rejection of the prayer
for dropping the charge under Section 376 of IPC suffers from
want of legal tenability in the peculiar facts of the case.
17. Since the sheet anchor of the submission of the
learned senior counsel is with regard to the exemption or
exception of husband under Section 375 of the IPC, it is
germane to notice Section 375 of the IPC from its inception. The
genesis of Section 375 of the IPC and its exception has its roots
in the Code propounded by Macaulay in 1837. It is Macaulay’s
Code that becomes the basis for the Indian Penal Code of 1860,
which governs the penal provisions even as on date with certain
changes on certain occasions. Exception to Section 375 has
existed in the IPC since the time of its enactment by the British
in the year 1860. Exception-2 then was guided by the laws that
were existent in all the countries where the British had their foot
on. They were several decades ago. It was founded and remained
on the premise of a contract in the medieval law that husbands
wielded their power over their wives. In the Victorian era women
were denied the exercise of basic rights and liberties and had
little autonomy over their choice. Their statuses were nothing
beyond than that of materialistic choices and were treated as
18. Post Republic, India is governed by the Constitution.
The Constitution treats woman equal to man and considers
marriage as an association of equals. The Constitution does not
in any sense depict the woman to be subordinate to a man. The
Constitution guarantees fundamental rights under Articles 14,
15, 19 and 21 which are right to live with dignity, personal
liberty, bodily integrity, sexual autonomy, right to reproductive
choices, right to privacy, right to freedom of speech and
expression. Under the Constitution, the rights are equal;
protection is also equal.
19. Close to eight score and three years, the need to tinker
with Section 375 of the IPC did not arise. A fateful incident of a
gang rape in the capital led to the Union Government
constituting a Committee headed by Justice J.S.Verma, to
suggest amendments dealing with sexual offences in the Code.
The Committee, after prolonged deliberations, gave several
recommendations for amendments to criminal law.              One such
was    concerning        ‘Marital   Rape’.   The    observations  and
recommendations of the Committee that are germane to be
recommendations in respect of India made by the UN
Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against
Women (“CEDAW Committee”) in February 2007. The
CEDAW Committee has recommended that the country
should “widen the definition of rape in its Penal Code to
reflect the realities of sexual abuse experienced by women
and to remove the exception of marital rape from the
definition of rape…..”
72. The exemption for marital rape stems from a long
out-dated notion of marriage which regarded wives as no
more than the property of their husbands. According to the
common law of coverture, a wife was deemed to have
consented at the time of the marriage to have intercourse
with her husband at his whim. Moreover, this consent
could not be revoked. As far back as 1736, Sir Matthew
Hale declared: ‘The husband cannot be guilty of rape
committed by himself upon his lawful wife, for by their
mutual matrimonial consent and contract the wife hath
given herself up in this kind unto her husband which she
cannot retract’.
73. This immunity has now been withdrawn in most
major jurisdictions. In England and Wales, the House of
Lords held in 1991 that the status of married women had
changed beyond all recognition since Hale set out his
proposition. Most importantly, Lord Keith, speaking for the
Court, declared, ‘marriage is in modern times regarded as
a partnership of equals, and no longer one in which the
wife must be the subservient chattel of the husband.’
74. Our view is supported by the judgment of the
European Commission of Human Rights in C.R. v UK,
which endorsed the conclusion that a rapist remains a
rapist regardless of his relationship with the victim.
Importantly, it acknowledged that this change in the
common law was in accordance with the fundamental
objectives of the Convention on Human Rights, the very
essence of which is respect for human rights, dignity and
freedom. This was given statutory recognition in the
Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994.
75. We find that the same is true in Canada, South
Africa and Australia. In Canada, the provisions in the
Criminal Code, which denied criminal liability for marital
rape, were repealed in 1983. It is now a crime in Canada
for a husband to rape his wife. South Africa criminalised
marital rape in 1993, reversing the common law principle
that a husband could not be found guilty of raping his wife.
Section 5 of the Prevention of Family Violence Act 1993
provides: ‘Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in any law or in the common law, a husband
may be convicted of the rape of his wife.’ In Australia, the
common law ‘marital rape immunity’ was legislatively
abolished in all jurisdictions from 1976. In 1991, the
Australian High Court had no doubt that: ‘if it was ever the
common law that by marriage a wife gave irrevocable
consent to sexual intercourse by her husband, it is no
longer the common law.’ According to Justice Brennan (as
he then was): ‘The common law fiction has always been
offensive to human dignity and incompatible with the legal
76. These jurisdictions have also gone further and
recognised that consent should not be implied by the
relationship between the accused and the complainant in
any event. In the Canadian 2011 Supreme Court decision
in R v. J.A., Chief Justice McLachlin emphasised that the
relationship between the accused and the complainant
‘does not change the nature of the inquiry into whether the
complaint consented’ to the sexual activity. The defendant
cannot argue that the complainant’s consent was implied
by the relationship between the accused and the
complainant. In South Africa, the 2007 Criminal Law
(Sexual Offences and Related Matters) Amendment Act
(‘Sexual Offences Act’) provides, at s. 56 (1), that a marital
or other relationship between the perpetrator or victim is
not a valid defence against the crimes of rape or sexual
77. Even when marital rape is recognised as a crime,
there is a risk that judges might regard marital rape as
less serious than other forms of rape, requiring more
lenient sentences, as happened in South Africa. In
response, the South African Criminal Law (Sentencing) Act
of 2007 now provides that the relationship between the
victim and the accused may not be regarded as a
‘substantial and compelling circumstance’ justifying a
deviation from legislatively required minimum sentences for
78. It is also important that the legal prohibition on
marital rape is accompanied by changes in the attitudes of
prosecutors, police officers and those in society more
generally. For example, in South Africa, despite these legal
developments, rates of marital rape remain shockingly
high. A 2010 study suggests that 18.8% of women are
raped by their partners on one or more occasion. Rates of
reporting and conviction also remain low, aggravated by
the prevalent beliefs that marital rape is acceptable or is
less serious than other types of rape. Changes in the law
therefore need to be accompanied by widespread
measures raising awareness of women’s rights to
autonomy and physical integrity, regardless of marriage or
other intimate relationship. This was underlined in Vertido
v The Philippines, a recent Communication under the
Optional Protocol of the Convention on the Elimination of
Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW), where the
CEDAW Committee emphasised the importance of
appropriate training for judges, lawyers, law enforcement
officers and medical personnel in understanding crimes of
rape and other sexual offences in a gender-sensitive
removed.
a. A marital or other relationship between
the perpetrator or victim is not a valid
b.  The relationship between the accused and the
complainant is not relevant to the inquiry into
whether the complainant consented to the
c. The fact that the accused and victim are married
or in another intimate relationship may not be
regarded as a mitigating factor justifying lower
sentences for rape.
80. We must, at this stage, rely upon Prof. Sandra
Freedman of the University of Oxford, who has submitted
to the Committee that that “training and awareness
programmes should be provided to ensure that all levels of
the criminal justice system and ordinary people are aware
that marriage should not be regarded as extinguishing the
legal or sexual autonomy of the wife”.
The recommendations of the Committee were accepted by the
Union Government partially and amendments were carried out.
The present case concerns the amendment to Section 375 of the
20. Section 375 of the IPC came to be amended with effect
from 10-05-2013 after introduction of Criminal Law Amendment
Bill before the Parliament, pursuant to the constitution of
J.S.Verma Committee for suggesting amendments to criminal
Section 375 of the IPC as it stood prior to its
amendment on 10-05-2013 reads as follows:
“375. Rape — A man is said to commit “rape” who,
except in the case hereinafter excepted, has sexual
intercourse with a woman under circumstances falling
under any of the six following descriptions:—
First     — Against her will.
Secondly.— Without her consent.
Thirdly. —    With her consent, when her consent has
been obtained by putting her or any person
in whom she is interested in fear of death or
of hurt.
Fourthly.— With her consent, when the man        knows that
he is not her husband, and that    her consent
is given because she believes       that he is
herself to be lawfully married.
Fifthly.—   With her consent, when, at the time of giving
such consent, by reason of unsoundness of
mind or intoxication or the administration by
him personally or through another of any
stupefying or unwholesome substance, she
consequences of that to which she gives
consent.
Sixthly.— With or without her consent, when she is under
sixteen years of age.
Explanation.—Penetration is sufficient to constitute the
sexual intercourse necessary to the offence of rape.
Pursuant to the amendment, Section 375 of the IPC
“375. Rape.—A man is said to commit “rape” if he—
(a) penetrates his penis, to any extent, into the vagina,
mouth, urethra or anus of a woman or makes her to do so
(b) inserts, to any extent, any object or a part of the body,
not being the penis, into the vagina, the urethra or anus of
a woman or makes her to do so with him or any other
(c) manipulates any part of the body of a woman so as to
cause penetration into the vagina, urethra, anus or any
part of body of such woman or makes her to do so with
(d) applies his mouth to the vagina, anus, urethra of a
woman or makes her to do so with him or any other
under the circumstances falling under any of the following
First      — Against her will.
Secondly.— Without her consent.
Thirdly. — With her consent, when her consent has been
obtained by putting her or any person in
whom she is interested, in fear of death or of
hurt.
Fourthly. — With her consent, when the man        knows that
he is not her husband and that    her consent
is given because she believes      that he is
herself to be lawfully married.
Fifthly. —     With her consent when, at the time of giving
such consent, by reason of unsoundness of
mind or intoxication or the administration by
him personally or through another of any
stupefying or unwholesome substance, she
consequences of that to which she gives
consent.
Sixthly. — With or without her consent, when she is under
eighteen years of age.
Explanation.—Penetration is sufficient to constitute the
sexual intercourse necessary to the offence
of rape.
The Exception to pre-amendment reads as follows:
“Exception.—Sexual intercourse by a man with his own wife,
the wife not being under fifteen years of age, is not rape.”
The Exception to post-amendment reads as follows:
“Exception 2.—Sexual intercourse or sexual acts by a man with
his own wife, the wife not being under fifteen years of age, is not
rape.”
There is a marked difference in the afore-quoted provisions, pre
and post of the Code and the exception with regard to inclusion
of certain physical activity qua the woman by a man.
21. The amended exception depicts intercourse by a man
with his own wife, the wife not being under 15 years of age
would not be a rape. The post amendment the exception adds
the words ‘sexual acts’ by a man along with the words ‘sexual
intercourse’. The difference is inclusion of the word “or sexual
acts”. Therefore, the exception now is of sexual intercourse and
other sexual acts by the husband stand exempted. Therefore, a
woman being a woman is given certain status; a woman being a
wife is given a different status. Likewise, a man being a man is
punished for his acts; a man being a husband is exempted for
his acts. It is this inequality that destroys the soul of the
Constitution which is Right to Equality.              The Constitution
recognizes and grants such equal status to woman as well. To

Article 14 depicts equality before law; Article 15 prohibits
discrimination on the ground of religion, race, caste, sex or place
of birth; Article 16 mandates equality of opportunity in matters
of public employment; Article 21 depicts protection of life and
personal liberty to all the citizens of the nation; Article 23
depicts prohibition of trafficking in human beings and forced
labour; Article 39 depicts certain principles of policies to be
followed by the State in securing rights of its citizens, emphasis
is laid on women. Women have been considered to be entitled to
reservation under Article 243D in the Panchayats and under
Article 243T in the Municipalities in the respective elections.
22. The aforesaid is the prism that depicts constitutional
spirit towards right of its citizens, be it a man or a woman.
Equality in Article 14 pervades through the entire spectrum of
the Constitution. The IPC itself recognizes several Acts against
women to become punishable, a few of them are:
“Section 304-B - Dowry death.—(1) Where the death of a
woman is caused by any burns or bodily injury or occurs
otherwise than under normal circumstances within seven

23. There are several other enactments which have been
enacted post the Constitution with the sole objective of
protection of woman or a girl child.               The soul of these
enactments are, protection of women and equal status to
women. The objects and reasons of the few of the enactments or
amendment to existing enactments are as follows:
The National Commission for Women - The
National Commission for Women was set up as statutory
body in January 1992 under the National Commission for
Women Act, 1990 (Act No.20 of 1990 of Govt.of India) to
review the Constitutional and legal safeguards for women;
recommend remedial legislative measures, facilitate
redressal of grievances and advise the Government on all
policy matters affecting women.
to provide in pursuance of the International Convention
signed at New York on the 9th day of May, 1950, for
[prevention of immoral traffic].
(Prohibition) Act, 1986 - An Act to prohibit indecent
representation of women through advertisements or in
publications, writings, paintings, figures or in any other
manner and for matters connected therewith or incidental
thereto.
“The object of this Bill is to prohibit the evil practice
of giving and taking of dowry. This question has been
engaging the attention of the Government for some time
past, and one of the methods by which this problem, which
is essentially a social one, was sought to be tackled was
by the conferment of improved property rights on women
by the Hindu Succession Act, 1956. It is, however, felt that
a law which makes the practice punishable and at the
same time ensures that any dowry, if given does ensure for
the benefit of the wife will go a long way to educating
public opinion and to the eradication of this evil. There has
also been a persistent demand for such a law both in and
outside Parliament. Hence, the present Bill. It, however,
takes care to exclude presents in the form of clothes,
ornaments, etc., which are customary at marriages,
provided the value thereof does not exceed Rs 2000. Such
a provision appears to be necessary to make the law
workable.” Gazette of India, 1959, Extra., Pt. II, S. 2, p.
397. See Joint Committee Report at id., pp. 1191-93.
Another path-breaking legislation which aims for
gender equality was passed by the House yesterday,
namely, the Hindu Succession (Amendment) Bill, 2005
which provides for devolution of interest in coparcenary
property to a daughter in the same manner as the son.
The amendments to the Hindu Succession Act fulfil a
longstanding promise we had made to our sisters and
daughters. Our government is firmly committed to the
empowerment of Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes,
other backward classes and all minorities. We are equally
committed to the empowerment of our women.”
The Protection of Human Rights Act, 1993 - An
Act to provide for the constitution of a National Human
Rights Commission, State Human Rights Commissions in
States and Human Rights Courts for better protection of
human rights and for matters connected therewith or
incidental thereto.
(Regulation and Prevention of Misuse) Act, 1994 - An
Act to provide for the regulation of the use of pre-natal
diagnostic techniques for the purpose of detecting genetic
or metabolic disorders or chromosomal abnormalities or
certain congenital malformations or sex linked disorders
and for the prevention of the misuse of such techniques for
the purpose of pre-natal sex determination leading to
female foeticide; and, for matters connected there with or
incidental thereto.
Protection of Women from Domestic violence
Act, 2005 - Domestic violence is undoubtedly a human
rights issue and serious deterrent to development. The
Vienna Accord of 1994 and the Beijing Declaration and the
Platform for Action (1995) have acknowledged this. The
United Nations Committee on Convention on Elimination of
All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (C E D A W) in
it's General Recommendation No. XII (1989) has
recommended that State Parties should act to protect
women against violence of any kind especially that
occulting within the family.”
The afore-quoted are a few of the enactments that are notified in
recognition of rights of women as also the wife and for their
protection on all counts.
24. On a coalesce of all the afore-said and afore-quoted
Articles of the Constitution, the provisions of the IPC and
specific Acts promulgated, what would unmistakably emerge is
the rights of women, protection of women and their equal status
to that of a man without exception. Therefore, women are equal
in its true sense factually and legally. The aforesaid provisions
are quoted only as a metaphor to demonstrate equality without
exception pervading through the entire spectrum of those
provisions, the Constitution, the code and the enactments.
25.   As   observed   hereinabove,   the  Constitution,  a
fountainhead of all statutes depicts equality. The Code practices
discrimination. Under the Code every other man indulging in
offences against woman is punished for those offences. But,
when it comes to Section 375 of IPC the exception springs. In
my considered view, the expression is not progressive but
regressive, wherein a woman is treated as a subordinate to the
husband, which concept abhors equality. It is for this reason
that several countries have made such acts of the husband
penal by terming it marital rape or spousal rape.
26. Marital rape is illegal in 50 American States, 3
Denmark, Norway, Soviet Union, Poland and Czechoslovakia and
several others. In the United Kingdom, which the present Code
largely draws from, has also removed the exception pursuant to
a judgment rendered by the House of Lords in R v. R in the year
1991. Therefore, the Code that was made by the rulers then, has
itself abolished the exception given to husbands.
27. Justice Verma Committee (supra) also recommended
for deletion of the exception of marital rape.          But, the
amendment came about was only replacing the word ‘rape’ with
‘sexual assault’ in Section 375 of IPC. Therefore, the situation
now emerges is equality pervades through the Constitution, but
inequality exists in the Code qua - Exception-2 to Section 375 of
28. A man who is well acquainted with a woman performs
all the ingredients as is found in pre or post amendment to
Section 375 of the IPC, can be proceeded against for offences
punishable under Section 376 of IPC.          Therefore, a man
sexually    assaulting  or raping   a woman     is  amenable   to
punishment under Section 376 of IPC.       The contention of the
learned senior counsel that if the man is the husband,
performing the very same acts as that of another man, he is
exempted. In my considered view, such an argument cannot be
countenanced. A man is a man; an act is an act; rape is a rape,
be it performed by a man the “husband” on the woman “wife”.
29. The submission of the learned senior counsel that the
husband is protected by the institution of marriage for any of his
acts being performed, as is performed by a common man, again
sans countenance, for the reason that institution of marriage
does not confer, cannot confer and in my considered view,
should not be construed to confer, any special male privilege or
a license for unleashing of a brutal beast. If it is punishable to a
man, it should be punishable to a man albeit, the man being a
30. A perusal at the complaint afore-extracted and written
communications (which cannot be extracted in the body of the
order) would send a chilling effect on any human being reading
the contents of it.  The wife-the complainant, cries foul in no
unmistakable terms that she is being brutally, sexually harassed
keeping her as a sex slave for ages.         The contents of the
complaint are an outburst of tolerance of the wife of the brutal
acts of the petitioner.    It is akin to eruption of a dormant
volcano. In the teeth of the facts, as narrated in the complaint,
in my considered view, no fault can be found with the learned
Sessions Judge taking cognizance of the offences punishable
under Section 376 of IPC and framing a charge to that effect.
31. The exemption of the husband on committal of such
assault/rape, in the peculiar facts and circumstances of this
case, cannot be absolute, as no exemption in law can be so
absolute that it becomes a license for commission of crime
against society. Though the four corners of marriage would not
mean society, it is for the legislature to delve upon the issue and
consider tinkering of the exemption.            This Court is not
pronouncing upon whether marital rape should be recognized as
an offence or the exception be taken away by the legislature. It
is for the legislature, on an analysis of manifold circumstances
and ramifications to consider the aforesaid issue. This Court is
concerned only with the charge of rape being framed upon the
husband alleging rape on his wife.
32. Every ingredient of rape is met with in the alleged
complaint. If it were to be a common man, the allegation on the
face of it be punishable under Section 376 of IPC, why not the
husband-petitioner. It is for the petitioner to come out clean in
the trial, if he is so much in the defensive of his acts.
Interjecting the trial in the teeth of the aforesaid complaint and
the charge being framed would become a travesty of justice.
33. Therefore, in the light of the ghastly allegations
against the petitioner-husband in the complaint and several
other communications, I find no error committed by the learned
Sessions Judge in taking cognizance, framing the charge under
Section 376 of the IPC and also rejecting the application to drop
the said charge. If the allegation of rape is removed from the
block of offences alleged, it would, in the peculiar facts of this
case, be doing tremendous injustice to the complainant-wife and
would amount to putting a premium on the carnal desires of the
petitioner.  Therefore,    the  point   that  has  arisen  for  my
consideration is held in favour of the prosecution and against
the petitioner.
Whether the allegation against the petitioner for
34. This now takes me to the next point with regard to the
alleged offences against the petitioner which are offences
punishable under Sections 498A, 354 and 506 of the IPC. The
complaint afore-quoted clearly brings out the offence punishable
under Section 498A of the IPC. Section 354 of the IPC which
deals with assault or criminal force on a woman with intent to
outrage her modesty is clearly met in the complaint. Section 506
of the IPC deals with criminal intimidation which is also met in
the   complaint.  Therefore,   the  offences  punishable    under
Sections 498A, 375, 354 and 506 of the IPC are all clearly spelt
out in the complaint, in the statements recorded during the
investigation and the contents of the summary in the charge
sheet (supra). None of the grounds urged by the learned senior
counsel with regard to the offences alleged against the wife merit
acceptance. There are various disputed questions of fact that
have to be thrashed out only in a full-fledged trial. If the
petitioner has anything in his defense on the allegations, it is for
him to put up such defense before the Sessions Court and come
out clean in the trial. It is not for this Court to interfere with the
trial, particularly, in the light of the aforesaid allegations.
Therefore, the trial against the petitioner insofar the wife is
concerned, for offences under the Code are to be continued, as
the petition with the aforesaid contentions sans merit.
Whether     the      prosecution     notwithstanding        the
presumption under Sections 29 and 30 of the Act has to
prove the foundational facts beyond all reasonable doubt?
35. The issue is with regard to presumption under
Sections 29 and 30 of the Act and notwithstanding the said
presumption against the accused the prosecution will have to
prove foundational facts beyond all reasonable doubt. The issue
has time and again cropped up before the Apex Court or this
Court in several cases concerning identical enactments as also
the Act.      Therefore, a deeper delving into the issue is not
warranted. The Apex Court in the case of GANGADHAR @
GANGARAM v. STATE OF MADHYA PRADESH1 considering
identical provisions of the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic
Substances Act, 1985 has held as follows:
“8. The presumption against the accused of
culpability under Section 35, and under Section 54
of the Act to explain possession satisfactorily, are
rebuttable. It does not dispense with the obligation of
the prosecution to prove the charge beyond all
reasonable doubt. The presumptive provision with
reverse burden of proof, does not sanction conviction
on basis of preponderance of probability. Section
35(2) provides that a fact can be said to have been
proved if it is established beyond reasonable doubt
and not on preponderance of probability.
9. That the right of the accused to a fair trial could
not be whittled down under the Act was considered in Noor
Aga v. State of Punjab [Noor Aga v. State of Punjab, (2008)
16 SCC 417 : (2010) 3 SCC (Cri) 748] observing: (SCC p.
“58. … An initial burden exists upon the prosecution
and only when it stands satisfied, would the legal burden
shift. Even then, the standard of proof required for the
accused to prove his innocence is not as high as that of the
prosecution. Whereas the standard of proof required to
prove the guilt of the accused on the prosecution is “beyond
all reasonable doubt” but it is “preponderance of
probability” on the accused. If the prosecution fails to prove
the foundational facts so as to attract the rigours of Section
35 of the Act, the actus reus which is possession of
contraband by the accused cannot be said to have been
established.
59. With a view to bring within its purview the
requirements of Section 54 of the Act, element of
possession of the contraband was essential so as to shift
the burden on the accused. The provisions being exceptions
to the general rule, the generality thereof would continue to
be operative, namely, the element of possession will have
to be proved beyond reasonable doubt.”
The Apex Court was following the judgment in the case of NOOR
AGA.      In the case of NOOR AGA V. STATE OF PUNJAB2 the
punishment prescribed therein being indisputably
stringent flowing from elements such as a
heightened standard for bail, absence of any
provision for remissions, specific provisions for grant
of minimum sentence, enabling provisions granting
power to the court to impose fine of more than
maximum punishment of Rs 2,00,000 as also the
presumption of guilt emerging from possession of
narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances, the
extent of burden to prove the foundational facts on
the prosecution i.e. “proof beyond all reasonable
doubt” would be more onerous. A heightened scrutiny
test would be necessary to be invoked. It is so
because whereas, on the one hand, the court must
strive towards giving effect to the parliamentary
object and intent in the light of the international
conventions, but, on the other, it is also necessary to
uphold the individual human rights and dignity as
provided for under the UN Declaration of Human
Rights by insisting upon scrupulous compliance with
the provisions of the Act for the purpose of upholding
the democratic values. It is necessary for giving effect to
the concept of “wider civilisation”. The court must always
remind itself that it is a well-settled principle of criminal
jurisprudence that more serious the offence, the stricter is
the degree of proof. A higher degree of assurance, thus,
would be necessary to convict an accused. In State of
Punjab v. Baldev Singh [(1999) 6 SCC 172 : 1999 SCC (Cri)
1080] it was stated: (SCC p. 199, para 28)
“28. … It must be borne in mind that severer the
punishment, greater has to be the care taken to see
that all the safeguards provided in a statute are
scrupulously followed.”
(See also RiteshChakarvarti v. State of M.P. [(2006) 12 SCC
57. It is also necessary to bear in mind that
superficially a case may have an ugly look and thereby,
prima facie, shaking the conscience of any court but it is
well settled that suspicion, however high it may be, can
under no circumstances, be held to be a substitute for legal
58. Sections 35 and 54 of the Act, no doubt,
raise presumptions with regard to the culpable
mental state on the part of the accused as also place
the burden of proof in this behalf on the accused; but
a bare perusal of the said provision would clearly
show that presumption would operate in the trial of
the accused only in the event the circumstances
contained therein are fully satisfied. An initial
burden exists upon the prosecution and only when it
stands satisfied, would the legal burden shift. Even
then, the standard of proof required for the accused
to prove his innocence is not as high as that of the
prosecution. Whereas the standard of proof required
to prove the guilt of the accused on the prosecution
is “beyond all reasonable doubt” but it is
“preponderance of probability” on the accused. If the
prosecution fails to prove the foundational facts so
as to attract the rigours of Section 35 of the Act, the
actus reus which is possession of contraband by the
accused cannot be said to have been established.
59. With a view to bring within its purview the
requirements of Section 54 of the Act, element of
possession of the contraband was essential so as to shift
the burden on the accused. The provisions being exceptions
to the general rule, the generality thereof would continue to
be operative, namely, the element of possession will have
to be proved beyond reasonable doubt.”
A    Co-ordinate      Bench      of  this    Court   in   the   case of
G.S.VENKATESH v. STATE OF KARNATAKA3                        has held as
“36. Coming to the contention urged by the learned
HCGP that by virtue of the presumption engrafted under
Sections 29 and 30 of the POCSO Act, the trial Court was
justified in holding the accused guilty of the offence under
Section 4 of the POCSO Act is concerned, at the outset it
should be noted that presumption is not proof.
"Presumption" is only an inference of certain facts drawn
from other true facts. In the words of the Hon'ble Supreme
Court in APS Forex Services Pvt. Ltd. Vs. Shakti
are devices by use of which the Courts are enabled and
entitled to pronounce on an issue notwithstanding that
there is no evidence or insufficient evidence." Presumption
does not relieve the prosecution of discharging its burden
to prove the guilt of the accused with the standard of proof
laid down under the general law. It is only when the
foundational facts constituting the offence charged against
the accused is proved by the prosecution, the presumption
gets attracted. It is trite law that merely on the basis of
presumption, a finding of guilt cannot be recorded against
an accused facing prosecution for criminal offences.
37. Insofar as the presumptions provided under
Sections 29 and 30 of the POCSO Act are concerned, they
are not absolute or conclusive presumptions. The sections
29. Presumption as to certain offences.--Where
a person is prosecuted for committing or abetting or
attempting to commit any offence under Sections 3,
5, 7 and Section 9 of this Act, the Special Court shall
presume, that such person has committed or abetted
or attempted to commit the offence, as the case may
be unless the contrary is proved.
30. Presumption of culpable mental state.--(1)
In any prosecution for any offence under this Act
which requires a culpable mental state on the part of
the accused, the Special Court shall presume the
existence of such mental state but it shall be a
defence for the accused to prove the fact that he had
no such mental state with respect to the act charged
as an offence in that prosecution.
(2) For the purposes of this section, a fact is said to
be proved only when the Special Court believes it to exist
beyond reasonable doubt and not merely when its
existence is established by a preponderance of probability.
Explanation: In this section, "culpable mental state"
includes intention, motive, knowledge of a fact and the
belief in, or reason to believe, a fact,
38. The use of expression "unless the contrary is
proved" appearing in Section 29 makes it clear that the
presumption raised under this section is rebuttable. A.
rebuttable presumption can be raised only when the
foundational facts constituting the offence are established
by the prosecution. In a criminal trial, the burden of proving
everything essential to the establishment of the charge
against the accused always rests on the prosecution, as
every man is presumed to be innocent until the contrary is
proved. In a case where an offence is committed
against a child, having regard to the very nature of
the offence where it is difficult for the prosecution to
prove the facts and circumstances in which the
offence had taken place, the Act has cast the burden
on the accused to prove the facts within his
knowledge as it is easier for the innocent accused to
produce evidence contrary to the case proved by the
prosecution. This is called reverse burden whereby
the burden is shifted to the accused to disprove the
facts established by the prosecution. The question of
discharging the reverse burden by the accused would
arise only when the initial burden cast on the
prosecution is discharged to the satisfaction of the
Court. Therefore it follows that without the proof of
basic facts constituting the offence charged against
the accused, the accused cannot be called upon to
disprove the case of the prosecution.
39. In the instant case, as the prosecution has failed
to establish the basic facts constituting the ingredients of
the offence charged against the accused, the presumption
created under Section 29 of the POCSO Act cannot be
invoked by the prosecution. For the same reason, the
culpable mental state including the intention, motive or
knowledge of the alleged offence cannot be imputed to the
accused merely on the basis of the presumption under
Section 30 of the POCSO Act. It is only when the
prosecution proves the basic facts constituting the offence
charged against the accused, the prosecution is relieved of
establishing the culpable mental state of the accused like
the intention, motive and knowledge, by virtue of the
presumption engrafted in Section 30 of the POCSO Act.
That being the legal position, the presumptions provided
under Sections 29 and 30 of the Act is of no avail to the
prosecution to sustain the impugned judgment insofar as
the conviction of the accused for the offences punishable
under Section 376 of IPC and Section 4 of the POCSO Act is
concerned.”
Following the judgment in the case of NOOR AGA, a learned
Single Judge of the Kerala High Court in LOUIS V. STATE OF
“10. Section 29 of the PoCSO Act expressly provides
that where a person is prosecuted for committing or
abetting or attempting to commit any offence under
sections 3, 5, 7 and section 9 of the Act, the Special Court
shall presume, that such person has committed or abetted
or attempted to commit the offence, as the case may be,
unless the contrary is proved.
11. Section 30 of the PoCSO Act provides that in any
prosecution for any offence under this Act which requires a
culpable mental state on the part of the accused, the
Special Court shall presume the existence of such mental
state but it shall be a defence for the accused to prove the
fact that he had no such mental state with respect to the
act charged as an offence in that prosecution. Sub-section
(2) of Section 30 of the PoCSO Act further provides that, a
fact is said to be proved only when the Special Court
believes it to exist beyond reasonable doubt and not merely
when its existence is established by a preponderance of
probability. Explanation to Section 30 further makes it
clear that “culpable mental state” includes intention,
motive, knowledge of a fact and the belief in, or reason to
believe, a fact.
12. In Justin @ Renjith V. Union of India, ILR 2020
Ker 679 it has been held by a learned single Judge of this
court that duty of prosecution to establish foundational
facts and duty of accused to rebut presumption arise only
after prosecution has established foundational facts of the
offence alleged against the accused. It is also found that
though in the light of presumptions, the burden of proof
oscillate between the prosecution and the accused,
depending on the quality of evidence let in, in practice
process of adducing evidence in a PoCSO case does not
substantially differ from any other criminal trial.
13. In David v. State of Kerala ((2020) 5 KLT
92 : 2020 Cri LJ 3995) another learned single Judge of this
court has held that the presumption under Section 29 of the
PoCSO Act does not in any way affect the obligation of the
prosecution to produce admissible evidence to prove the
foundational facts constituting the offence.
14. Harendra Sarkar v. State of Assam ((2008) 9
SCC 204 : AIR 2008 SC 2467) was quoted by the learned
Judge in that decision where in it has been held by the
Apex Court that the Parliament certainly has the power to
lay down a different standard of proof for certain offences
or certain pattern of crimes subject to the establishment of
some foundational facts and the same would not therefor
affect any of the constitutional and established rights of
the accused in such cases.
15. So Section 29 and 30 of the Act does not give
any special rights to the prosecution to refrain from
adducing evidence in the normal course as in a criminal
case to prove the guilt of the accused beyond reasonable
doubt. If the basic facts proving guilt is proved by the
prosecution, presumption starts to run. It is for the accused
to rebut that presumption. If the prosecution proved the
acts, as per Section 30 of the Act, presumption of culpable
mental state begins to run. It is for the accused to rebut
that presumption.”
A coalesce of all the afore-extracted judgments of the Apex Court
and this Court are considered in the teeth of Sections 29 and 30
of the Act, which is extensively considered in the afore-extracted
judgment of the Apex Court, this Court and the Kerala High
Court, what would unmistakably emerge is, notwithstanding the
presumption available against the accused in favour of the
prosecution in terms of Sections 29 and 30 of the Act, proving of
foundational facts by the prosecution beyond all reasonable
doubt is imperative.
36. The prosecution cannot, on the basis of preponderance
of probability, rest its case on the ground that proving of
innocence is shifted on the accused in the light of Sections 29
and 30 of the Act. The Apex Court in the case of GANGADHAR
following NOOR AGA and this Court again considering the
judgment in NOOR AGA have delineated and affirmed the view
that burden of proving foundational facts beyond all reasonable
doubt   vests on the      prosecution even in statutes where
presumption of guilt is hoarded upon the accused. The
judgments are also an answer to the contention of the learned
senior counsel that the accused have to prove their innocence
after completion of evidence of the prosecution and recording of
313 Cr.P.C. statements of the accused. Therefore, there is no
necessity to create a stage for an order to be passed under
Section 232 of the Cr.P.C. as contended by the learned senior
37. The issue with regard to constitutional validity of
presumption under Sections 29 and 39 of the Act has been given
up by the learned senior counsel in the light of the Apex Court
and that of this Court affirming identical clauses of presumption
under this statute and identical statutes against the accused.
Therefore, point No.(iii) that has arisen for consideration is
accordingly answered by holding that the prosecution has to
prove the foundational facts beyond all reasonable doubt and
cannot rest its case on preponderance of probability, merely
because the statute imposes reverse burden upon the accused
on proving innocence in place of the prosecution proving the
Whether the designated Court to try the offences
under the Act has jurisdiction to try both the offences
under the IPC and the Act in the facts of this case?
38. The contention of the learned senior counsel has given
way to the aforesaid issue for consideration of facts and
allegations in the case at hand with regard to offences
punishable under the Code and the Act. Insofar as the
complainant/mother is concerned, the offences are under the
Code. Insofar as the allegations against the daughter are
concerned, the offences are under the Act.         The complaint
narrated hereinabove give rise to the offences punishable under
Sections 5 and 6 of the Act. The contention of the learned senior
counsel appearing for the petitioner is that the case is being
tried before the specially designated Court under the Act, which
Court is not empowered to consider the offences under the Code
and therefore, the trial has to be segregated. The IPC offences
should be tried by the designated Court and the POSCO offences
by the special Court. This submission is unacceptable in the
peculiar facts of this case. The mother and the child both are
victims of brutal acts on the part of the petitioner.       It is the
mother who has complained against the petitioner for the
offences committed by him both on herself and her daughter.
The mother is also privy to what is narrated in the complaint.
Both the cases are triable only by the Sessions Court and the
Judge who is now to try both the cases is the Sessions Judge.
39. In several cases two special enactments come into play
for a particular offence – one under the Code and the other
under the SC/ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, both of which are
triable by the Sessions Court. One may involve a child and the
other may involve the offences under Atrocities Act. Therefore, if
the Court does not have jurisdiction itself to try the offences that
are now alleged, it would have been a different circumstance
altogether and the trial ought to have been segregated. Reference
being made to the judgment of the Apex Court in the case of
VIVEK GUPTA V. CBI5, in the circumstances is apposite, wherein
“12. We have given to the rival submissions our
deep consideration and we are of the view that the
contention of the respondent must be upheld. It is
worth noticing that sub-section (3) of Section 4 of the
Act provides that a Special Judge may “also try any
offence” other than an offence specified in Section 3
with which the accused may under the Code of
Criminal Procedure be charged at the same trial. We
have observed earlier that the provisions of the Code
of Criminal Procedure apply to trials under the Act
subject to certain modifications as contained in
Section 22 of the Act and their exclusion either
express or by necessary implication.
13. Section 223 of the Code of Criminal Procedure
has not been excluded either expressly or by necessary
implication nor has the same been modified in its
application to trials under the Act. The said provision
therefore is applicable to the trial of an offence punishable
under the Act. The various provisions of the Act which we
have quoted earlier make it abundantly clear that under
the provisions of the Act a Special Judge is not precluded
altogether from trying any other offence, other than
offences specified in Section 3 thereof. A person charged of
an offence under the Act may in view of sub-section (3) of
Section 4 be charged at the same trial of any offence under
any other law with which he may, under the Code of
Criminal Procedure, be charged at the same trial. Thus a
public servant who is charged of an offence under the
provisions of the Act may be charged by the Special Judge
at the same trial of any offence under IPC if the same is
committed in a manner contemplated by Section 220 of the
14. The only narrow question which remains to be
answered is whether any other person who is also charged
of the same offence with which the co-accused is charged,
but which is not an offence specified in Section 3 of the Act,
can be tried with the co-accused at the same trial by the
Special Judge. We are of the view that since sub-section (3)
of Section 4 of the Act authorizes a Special Judge to try any
offence other than an offence specified in Section 3 of the
Act to which the provisions of Section 220 apply, there is
no reason why the provisions of Section 223 of the Code
should not apply to such a case. Section 223 in clear terms
provides that persons accused of the same offence
committed in the course of the same transaction, or
persons accused of different offences committed in the
course of the same transaction may be charged and tried
together. Applying the provisions of Sections 3 and 4 of the
Act and Sections 220 and 223 of the Code of Criminal
Procedure, it must be held that the appellant and his co-
accused may be tried by the Special Judge in the same
15. This is because the co-accused of the appellant
who have been also charged of offences specified in
Section 3 of the Act must be tried by the Special Judge,
who in view of the provisions of sub-section (3) of Section 4
and Section 220 of the Code may also try them of the
charge under Section 120-B read with Section 420 IPC. All
the three accused, including the appellant, have been
charged of the offence under Section 120-B read with
Section 420 IPC. If the Special Judge has jurisdiction to try
the co-accused for the offence under Section 120-B read
with Section 420 IPC, the provisions of Section 223 are
attracted. Therefore, it follows that the appellant who is
also charged of having committed the same offence in the
course of the same transaction may also be tried with
them. Otherwise it appears rather incongruous that some
of the conspirators charged of having committed the same
offence may be tried by the Special Judge while the
remaining conspirators who are also charged of the same
offence will be tried by another court, because they are not
charged of any offence specified in Section 3 of the Act.
16. Reliance was placed by the respondent on the
judgment in Union of India v. I.C. Lala [(1973) 2 SCC 72 :
1973 SCC (Cri) 738 : AIR 1973 SC 2204] but the counsel
for the appellant distinguished that case submitting that
the facts of that case are distinguishable inasmuch as in
that case apart from the two army officers, even the third
appellant who was a businessman, was charged of the
offence punishable under Section 120-B IPC read with
Section 5(2) of the Act. Such being the factual position in
that case, Section 3(1)(d) of the relevant Act was clearly
attracted. In the instant case he submitted, there was no
charge against the appellant of having conspired to commit
an offence punishable under the Act. The aforesaid
judgment refers to an earlier decision of this Court in the
case of State of A.P. v. KandimallaSubbaiah [AIR 1961 SC
1241 : (1961) 2 Cri LJ 302] . The learned counsel for the
appellant distinguishes that case also for the same reason,
since in that case as well the respondent was charged of
conspiracy to commit an offence punishable under the Act.
17. We are, therefore, of the view that in the
facts and circumstances of this case, the Special
Judge while trying the co-accused of an offence
punishable under the provisions of the Act as also an
offence punishable under Section 120-B read with
Section 420 IPC has the jurisdiction to try the
appellant also for the offence punishable under
Section 120-B read with Section 420 IPC applying
the principles incorporated in Section 223 of the
Code. We, therefore, affirm the finding of the High
Court and dismiss this appeal.
The Apex Court in the aforesaid case was considering offences
under two different enactments being tried by the same Court,
one for the offences under the IPC and the other under the
Prevention of Corruption Act. The Apex Court has interpreted
Section 220 of the Cr.P.C. and Section 22 of the Prevention of
Corruption Act. Section 28(2) of the Act is identical to what the
Apex Court has considered.
40. Therefore, in the light of the judgment of the Apex
Court and the provisions of the Act, I am of the considered view
that the trial that is now sought to be held before the POSCO
Court by the Sessions Judge can also try the offences alleged
under the Code. Therefore, the point that has arisen for
consideration is answered against the petitioner.
Whether charges framed against the petitioner
should be altered to include addition of the offence
To consider this issue, the contents and the challenge in
W.P.No.50089/2018 is to be noticed.
41. The victim has preferred writ petitions before this
Court in Writ Petition No.12976 of 2017 and Writ Petition
No.50089 of 2018. In Writ Petition No.50089 of 2018 the
petitioner challenges a rejection order of the application filed by
the prosecution to modify or alter the charge for offences under
Section 377 of the IPC, as the allegations at the outset against
the petitioner are inclusive of Section 377 of the IPC. The Police
while filing the charge sheet have excluded Section 377 of the
IPC. The prosecution files application under Section 216 of the
Cr.P.C. to alter the charge against the petitioner by including the
offences under Section 377 of the IPC. Section 377 of the IPC
“377. Unnatural offences.—Whoever voluntarily
has carnal intercourse against the order of nature with any
man, woman or animal, shall be punished with
imprisonment for life, or with imprisonment of either
description for a term which may extend to ten years, and
shall also be liable to fine.
Explanation.—Penetration is sufficient to constitute
the carnal intercourse necessary to the offence described in
this section.”
If the afore-quoted provision of law is noticed qua the complaint
and the charge sheet filed, what can unmistakably infer is that
the petitioner had indulged in acts of unnatural sex. This is the
specific allegation against the petitioner. Therefore, the charges
framed ought to have been inclusive of Section 377 of the IPC
42. The prosecution did file an application under Section
216 of the Cr.P.C. to include the charge, of and for offence
punishable under Section 377 of the IPC. The reason rendered
by the trial Court for rejecting the said application as found in
paragraph 12 of its order, needs to be noticed:
“12. By going through entire record, charge sheet
and instant application with objection, this Court already
framed charge against accused No.1 in respect of offence
under Section 376 of IPC. Now the complainant sought for
framing of charge under Section 377 of IPC. Section 377 of
IPC defines in respect of unnatural offence: Whoever
voluntarily has carnal intercourse against the order of
nature with any man, woman or animal, shall be punished
with imprisonment for life, or with imprisonment of either
description for a term which may extend to ten years, and
shall also be liable to fine. Here, as per the charge sheet
the complainant is not a stranger to the accused
No.1 and she is his wife. When the allegations made
against him attracts under Section 376 of IPC and
the charge also framed in respect of said offences,
question of considering the request to frame charge
under Section 377 of IPC does not arise. However, no
material is placed in respect of allegations made against
other five persons named above and also no such
supporting documents placed by the complainant to believe
the alleged offences against them, except hand written
letters filed one after another without appearing before the
Court and without giving her evidence and also the
evidence of victim girl. In respect of other two persons viz.,
Shakuntala Sahoo and Jagannath Sahoo-the parents of
accused No.1, the Hon’ble High Court has quashed the
proceedings in        its order dated 03-07-2018 in
Criminal Revision Petition No.423 of 2018, hence question
of taking cognizance against them again and again as
prayed by the complainant does not arise. The application
lacks bona fide, whatever stand the complainant wants to
take against the accused No.1 she has to appear before the
Court to give her evidence, if any incriminating evidence
appeared against the above said five persons as on the
date of the incident, then only the cognizance has to be
taken against them, but not as prayed by the complainant.
The complainant dodging the case without appearing
before the court to give her evidence, even though the trial
commenced and the charges framed against the accused
No.1. This act of the complainant is not acceptable in this
case. Taking into consideration of the entire material facts
and circumstances as such in the application, objections
and entire records, this Court feels to observe that the
application deserves to be rejected. Accordingly, I hold
point No.1 in the “Negative”.
The primary reason rendered by the Sessions Judge is that the
complainant is not a stranger to the husband –accused No.1 and
she is his wife.
43. The finding that when the allegations made against the
husband attracts Section 376 of the IPC and a charge is also
framed in respect of the said offences, question of considering
the request to frame a charge under Section 377 of the IPC does
not arise, is erroneous. The allegations clearly make out an
offence punishable under Section 377 of the Code which deals
with unnatural sex. Therefore, the order under challenge is to
be set aside allowing the application filed by the prosecution
under Section 216 of the Cr.P.C. with a direction to the trial
Court to frame the charge for the offence punishable under
Section 377 of the IPC as well. The point that has arisen for
consideration is accordingly answered.
Whether   proceedings    under    the  POCSO    Act
against the petitioner needs to be interfered with?
44. The aforesaid issue is with regard to interference
against the petitioner in the proceedings under the Act.     The
complaint, if noticed, would unmistakably highlight the actions
of the petitioner which would touch upon offences under the Act.
The plea of reverse burden being contrary to the spirit of the
Constitution or the criminal law jurisprudence has already been
negatived while considering identical provisions of reverse
burden in other enactments and answer to point No.(iii) (supra).
Looking at the complaint allegations as also the written
communications of the child which cannot be extracted and
made a part of the order, would all require a trial against the
petitioner for him to come out clean by projecting such defence
as is available.   Any further observation with regard to the
allegations or the contentions advanced by the learned senior
counsel insofar as it concerns the allegations qua the Act would
come in the way of the defence of the petitioner in the trial.
Therefore, in my considered view, even for the offences under the
Act a full blown trial is necessary in the facts and circumstances
of the case. Therefore, this point is also answered against the
45. This writ petition is also filed by the victim seeking
several prayers with regard to social security and compensation.
The petition was filed long before all the above petitions were
filed. The petition was preferred on 23-03-2017. In the light of
the subsequent order passed in the companion petitions, the
prayer sought in this petition need not be gone into at this stage.
However, it is open to the petitioner-victim to file any such
application before the competent Court where the trial would
begin and be in progress. Therefore, the writ petition is disposed
of as having become unnecessary.
46. The facts in this case have no relation to the facts
obtaining in the companion petitions. This petition is tagged
along with other petitions only for the reason that constitutional
validity of Sections 29 and 30 of the Act was called in question
as was called in question in the companion petitions. The
reasons rendered in answering the issue of presumption under
Sections 29 and 30 of the Act in the companion petitions would
become applicable to this writ petition as well. Insofar as other
reliefs sought are concerned, the facts would be necessary to be
seen as is pleaded in the case.
47. The petitioner and the complainant-victim were
acquaintances. It is the case of the prosecution that the
complainant and her senior college-mate Miss.Kinneri Loth had
been to Fusion Lounge, a pub on M.G.Road on 7-10-2016. At
about 10 p.m. they were introduced to two boys who were
known to the friend of the complainant. After they left the pub
the friend of the victim told the victim that the boys whom she
has introduced will drop her in their car. At around 10.15 p.m.
accused No.1 took the victim to his house. The petitioner was
also accompanied by the friend and they appear to have had
dinner in the house of accused No.1. After the dinner the friend
of the victim having drunk too much of alcohol slept inside the
bedroom and the complainant was still sitting on the sofa.
Accused No.1 again offered alcohol to the complainant and the
complainant began to drink, at which point in time, the
petitioner/accused No.2 began to fondle her by touching her on
all parts of the body and tried to molest her. The complainant
resisted and gets up from the sofa. It is at that point in time
accused No.1 dragged the complainant into the room and
commits forcible sexual intercourse/rape. It is the case of the
prosecution that after committing such rape accused No.1
threatened not to divulge the incident to the Police. Since
parents of the complainant were in Iran, she did not lodge any
complaint immediately, but on 19-10-2016, she did lodge a
complaint before the jurisdictional police for offences punishable
under Sections 376, 506 and 511 r/w Section 34 of the IPC and
Sections 4, 8, 16 and 18 of the Act.
48. The contention of the learned senior counsel appearing
for the petitioner is that the petitioner is innocent as he did not
commit any forcible sexual intercourse upon the victim. It is
only accused No.1 who is alleged to have dragged into the room
and committed such act of rape and therefore, he should not be
tried for offences under Section 376 of the IPC as he has not
committed ingredients of offences punishable under Section 375
of the IPC and any of the provisions of the Act. The allegation is
only that he has tried to touch the body, but the girl refused and
went away. He would submit that if trial is permitted against the
petitioner it would result in miscarriage of justice, as the
petitioner is a student of B-Pharma.
49.   On    the  other   hand,   the    learned  High  Court
Government Pleader appearing for the State would vehemently
refute the submissions and contends that, it is a matter of trial
as the petitioner had indulged himself in an act that would
touch upon the offence of rape. If the evidence is not convincing
he would always be acquitted of the charge. In a case of this
nature, this Court would not generally interfere in exercise of its
jurisdiction under Section 482 of the Cr.P.C.
50. I have      given my anxious consideration to the
submissions made by the respective learned senior counsel and
the learned High Court Government Pleader and perused the
material on record.
51. The afore-narrated facts are not in dispute. The
allegations against the petitioner and accused No.1 are for
offences punishable under Sections 506, 376, 511 and 34 of the
IPC along with offences under the Act. It is not in dispute that
the victim was below 18 years and the Act becomes applicable to
the case.    The graphic details with which the complaint is
registered as narrated hereinabove would not enure to the
benefit of the petitioner to contend that he has nothing to do in
the entire episode of rape against the victim.     The role of the
petitioner would come about only in a full-fledged trial.     After
filing of the charge sheet the petitioner files an application
seeking discharge on the ground that on perusal of entire charge
sheet   material  and   looking   into the    submission   of  the
complainant-victim there are no materials for the alleged
offences against him.
52. The Sessions Court considering the documents that
were placed by the prosecution clearly narrates that accused
No.2 has given a statement before the doctor that accused No.1
had sexual intercourse with the victim and the same was
provoked by accused No.2. Accused No.2 also tried to have
sexual intercourse with the victim. Since she refused the only
act that he committed was touching private parts of her body.
This statement is also signed by accused No.2. Therefore, this
being the evidence, it is only a matter of trial in which accused
No.2 will have to come out clean for the offence punishable
under Section 376 of the IPC and be tried for other offences
under the Act or the Code. There are serious disputed questions
of fact that are to be thrashed out only in a trial, as the
petitioner was the one who accompanied the victim to the house
of accused No.1 and it is the petitioner who first provoked the
victim to have sexual intercourse as is alleged. Therefore, these
factors will have to come out only in a full blown trial. There is
no warrant to interfere at this stage in the light of the allegations
under the Act as well. The Apex Court in the case of KAPTAN
SINGH v. STATE OF UTTAR PRADESH6 has held as follows:
“9.1. At the outset, it is required to be noted that in
the present case the High Court in exercise of powers
under Section 482 CrPC has quashed the criminal
proceedings for the offences under Sections 147, 148, 149,
406, 329 and 386 IPC. It is required to be noted that when
the High Court in exercise of powers under Section 482
CrPC quashed the criminal proceedings, by the time the
investigating officer after recording the statement of the
witnesses, statement of the complainant and collecting the
evidence from the incident place and after taking statement
of the independent witnesses and even statement of the
accused persons, has filed the charge-sheet before the
learned Magistrate for the offences under Sections 147,
148, 149, 406, 329 and 386 IPC and even the learned
Magistrate also took the cognizance. From the impugned
judgment and order [Radhey Shyam Gupta v. State of U.P.,
2020 SCC OnLine All 914] passed by the High Court, it
does not appear that the High Court took into consideration
the material collected during the investigation/inquiry and
even the statements recorded. If the petition under Section
482 CrPC was at the stage of FIR in that case the
allegations in the FIR/complaint only are required to be
considered and whether a cognizable offence is disclosed
or not is required to be considered. However, thereafter
when the statements are recorded, evidence is collected
and the charge-sheet is filed after conclusion of the
investigation/inquiry the matter stands on different footing
and the Court is required to consider the material/evidence
collected during the investigation. Even at this stage also,
as observed and held by this Court in a catena of
decisions, the High Court is not required to go into the
merits of the allegations and/or enter into the merits of the
case as if the High Court is exercising the appellate
jurisdiction and/or conducting the trial. As held by this
Court     in Dineshbhai    Chandubhai        Patel [Dineshbhai
Chandubhai Patel v. State of Gujarat, (2018) 3 SCC 104 :
(2018) 1 SCC (Cri) 683] in order to examine as to whether
factual contents of FIR disclose any cognizable offence or
not, the High Court cannot act like the investigating agency
nor can exercise the powers like an appellate court. It is
further observed and held that that question is required to
be examined keeping in view, the contents of FIR and
prima facie material, if any, requiring no proof. At such
stage, the High Court cannot appreciate evidence nor can it
draw its own inferences from contents of FIR and material
relied on. It is further observed it is more so, when the
material relied on is disputed. It is further observed that in
such a situation, it becomes the job of the investigating
authority at such stage to probe and then of the court to
examine questions once the charge-sheet is filed along with
such material as to how far and to what extent reliance
can be placed on such material.
Murlidhar Sonar v. State of Maharashtra, (2019) 18 SCC
191 : (2020) 3 SCC (Cri) 672] after considering the
decisions of this Court in Bhajan Lal [State of
Haryana v. Bhajan Lal, 1992 Supp (1) SCC 335 : 1992
SCC (Cri) 426] , it is held by this Court that exercise of
powers under Section 482 CrPC to quash the proceedings
is an exception and not a rule. It is further observed that
inherent jurisdiction under Section 482 CrPC though wide
is to be exercised sparingly, carefully and with caution,
only when such exercise is justified by tests specifically
laid down in the section itself. It is further observed that
appreciation of evidence is not permissible at the stage of
quashing of proceedings in exercise of powers under
Section 482 CrPC. Similar view has been expressed by this
Court in Arvind Khanna [CBI v. Arvind Khanna, (2019) 10
SCC 686 : (2020) 1 SCC (Cri) 94] , Managipet [State of
Telangana v. Managipet, (2019) 19 SCC 87 : (2020) 3 SCC
(Cri) 702] and in XYZ [XYZ v. State of Gujarat, (2019) 10
SCC 337 : (2020) 1 SCC (Cri) 173] , referred to hereinabove.
10. The High Court has failed to appreciate
and consider the fact that there are very serious
triable issues/allegations which are required to be
gone into and considered at the time of trial. The
High Court has lost sight of crucial aspects which
have emerged during the course of the investigation.
The High Court has failed to appreciate and consider
the fact that the document i.e. a joint notarised
affidavit of Mamta Gupta Accused 2 and Munni Devi
under which according to Accused 2 Ms Mamta
Gupta, Rs 25 lakhs was paid and the possession was
transferred to her itself is seriously disputed. It is
required to be noted that in the registered agreement
to sell dated 27-10-2010, the sale consideration is
stated to be Rs 25 lakhs and with no reference to
payment of Rs 25 lakhs to Ms Munni Devi and no
reference to handing over the possession. However, in
the joint notarised affidavit of the same date i.e. 27-
10-2010 sale consideration is stated to be Rs 35
lakhs out of which Rs 25 lakhs is alleged to have
been paid and there is a reference to transfer of
possession to Accused 2. Whether Rs 25 lakhs has
been paid or not the accused have to establish
during the trial, because the accused are relying
upon the said document and payment of Rs 25 lakhs
as mentioned in the joint notarised affidavit dated
27-10-2010. It is also required to be considered that
the first agreement to sell in which Rs 25 lakhs is
stated to be sale consideration and there is reference
to the payment of Rs 10 lakhs by cheques. It is a
registered document. The aforesaid are all triable
issues/allegations which are required to be
considered at the time of trial. The High Court has
failed to notice and/or consider the material
collected during the investigation.
11. Now so far as the finding recorded by the
High Court that no case is made out for the offence
under Section 406 IPC is concerned, it is to be noted
that the High Court itself has noted that the joint
notarised affidavit dated 27-10-2010 is seriously
disputed, however as per the High Court the same is
required to be considered in the civil proceedings.
There the High Court has committed an error. Even
the High Court has failed to notice that another FIR
has been lodged against the accused for the offences
under Sections 467, 468, 471 IPC with respect to the
said alleged joint notarised affidavit. Even according
to the accused the possession was handed over to
them. However, when the payment of Rs 25 lakhs as
mentioned in the joint notarised affidavit is seriously
disputed and even one of the cheques out of 5
cheques each of Rs 2 lakhs was dishonoured and
according to the accused they were handed over the
possession (which is seriously disputed) it can be
said to be entrustment of property. Therefore, at this
stage to opine that no case is made out for the
offence under Section 406 IPC is premature and the
aforesaid aspect is to be considered during trial. It is
also required to be noted that the first suit was filed
by Munni Devi and thereafter subsequent suit came
to be filed by the accused and that too for permanent
injunction only. Nothing is on record that any suit
for specific performance has been filed. Be that as it
may, all the aforesaid aspects are required to be
considered at the time of trial only.
14. In view of the above and for the reasons stated
above, the impugned judgment and order [Radhey Shyam
Gupta v. State of U.P., 2020 SCC OnLine All 914] passed
by the High Court quashing the criminal proceedings in
exercise of powers under Section 482 CrPC is
unsustainable and the same deserves to be quashed and
set aside and is accordingly quashed and set aside. Now,
the trial is to be conducted and proceeded further in
accordance with law and on its own merits. It is made
clear that the observations made by this Court in the
present proceedings are to be treated to be confined to the
proceedings under Section 482 CrPC only and the trial
court to decide the case in accordance with law and on its
own merits and on the basis of the evidence to be laid and
without being influenced by any of the observations made
by us hereinabove. The present appeal is accordingly
allowed.”
In the aforesaid case, the Apex Court has held that in the teeth
of seriously disputed questions of fact, the Court exercising its
jurisdiction either under Section 226 of the Constitution of India
or under Section 482 of the Cr.P.C. would not interfere or
interject such trial.
53. The order impugned rejecting the discharge application
of the petitioner is not even called in question in the case at
hand. What is called in question is quashing of entire
proceedings in Special C.C.No.41 of 2017 under the Act.
Therefore, there is no warrant to interfere in the case at hand.
• Charge framed against the husband for alleged offence
punishable under Section 376 of the IPC for alleged
rape of his wife, in the peculiar facts of this case, does
not warrant any interference. It is a matter of trial.
• Other offences alleged against the petitioner, the ones
punishable under Sections 498A, 354, 506 of the IPC
are clearly brought out in the complaint and in the
charge sheet. This is again a matter of trial.
• The prosecution, notwithstanding presumption against
the accused under Sections 29 and 30 of the POCSO
Act,   has    to  prove  foundational      facts  beyond    all
reasonable doubt.
• The charge framed by the Sessions Court is to be
altered  by   inclusion of    offence   punishable   under
Section 377 of the IPC owing to peculiar facts of this
case.
• The designated Court hearing cases relating to offences
under the POCSO Act can try the offences under the
IPC as well, in the facts of the case.
• Allegations against the petitioner-husband for offences
punishable under the POCSO Act for alleged sexual acts
on the daughter cannot be interfered with. It is yet
again a matter of trial.
Ergo, a parting observation in the facts and circumstances
of the case may not be inapt. Ours is a nation governed by the
Constitution.  Article 14 of the Constitution of India pervades
through the soul of every statute and every bead of decision
making. There is no statute promulgated post the Constitution
where there is no application of concept of equality as enshrined
in Article 14 of the Constitution of India. The Constitution is not
a statute, but is the fountain head of all statutes. If the
Constitution mandates equality, the statute ought to follow suit.
If a man, a husband, a man he is, can be exempted of allegation
of commission of ingredients of Section 375 of the IPC,
inequality percolates into such provision of law. Therefore, it
would run counter to what is enshrined in Article 14 of the
Constitution. All human beings under the Constitution are to be
treated equal, be it a man, be it a woman and others. Any
thought of inequality, in any provision of law, would fail the test
of Article 14 of the Constitution. Woman and man being equal
under the Constitution cannot be made unequal by Exception-2
to Section 375 of the IPC. It is for the law makers to ponder over
existence of such inequalities in law. For ages man donning the
robes of a husband has used the wife as his chattel; butt his
crude behavior notwithstanding his existence because of a
woman. The age old thought and tradition that the husbands
are the rulers of their wives, their body, mind and soul should
be effaced. It is only on this archaic, regressive and preconceived
notion, the cases of this kind are mushrooming in the nation.
This is in fact in public domain. A brutal act of sexual assault on
the wife, against her consent, albeit by the husband, cannot but
be termed to be a rape. Such sexual assault by a husband on
his wife will have grave consequences on the mental sheet of the
wife, it has both psychological and physiological impact on her.
Such acts of husbands scar the soul of the wives. It is, therefore,
imperative for the law makers to now “hear the voices of
54. For the aforesaid reasons, I pass the following:
(i)    Writ Petition No.48367 of 2018 filed by accused No.1
stands dismissed.
(ii)   Writ Petition No.12976 of 2017 is disposed of having
become unnecessary.
(iii)  Writ Petition No.10001 of 2018 stands dismissed.
(iv)  Writ Petition No.50089 of 2018 is allowed in part.
The Sessions Court is directed to frame a charge for
offences punishable under Section 377 of the IPC
against the petitioner.
(v)   The observations made in the course of this order are
only for considering the cases of the petitioners in
challenge to the provisions of the Act and the Code.
The Sessions Court shall not be influenced or bound
by the observations made in the course of this order.
In view of disposal of the petitions, all pending applications
also stand disposed.
