The biological parents, i.e. appellant Nos.3 and 4 and
alleged adoptive parents, i.e. appellant Nos.1 and 2 entered
into unregistered agreement of an 'unborn child' in the form of
adoption, jointly filed the present appeal against the judgment
and decree dated 31-5-2022 passed in G & W.C. No.9 of 2021
MFA No. 4617 of 2022
on the file of the Additional Senior Civil Judge, Udupi,
dismissing the petition filed under Sections 7 to 10 and 25 of
the Guardians and Wards Act, 1890 (for short, 'the Act').
I.  Facts of the case
2.   Appellant Nos.1 and 2 filed the petition before the
trial Court under the provisions of Sections 7 to 10 and 25 of
the G & W Act to grant permission to appoint them as the
adoptive parents and guardians of a minor child, by name
Inshu. Appellants Nos.3 and 4 are the biological parents of the
said child. The child was born on 26-3-2020. Since appellant
Nos.1 and 2 were childless and appellant Nos.3 and 4 were
unable to look after the child due to poverty, appellant Nos.1
and 2 adopted the child. After adoption of the child, appellant
Nos.1 and 2 have looked after raised the child for two years as
their own daughter with love and affection.    The respondent-
State represented by Legal-cum-Probation Officer, District Child
Protection Unit, Udupi, lodged a complaint against appellant
Nos.3 and 4 stating that they have illegally sold the child to
appellant Nos.1 and 2. However, the only mistake committed
by appellant Nos.3 and 4, biological parents, and appellant
MFA No. 4617 of 2022
Nos.1 and 2, adoptive parents, is that due to lack of proper
legal knowledge and guidance, the procedure was not complied
with.   Now, the child is in the custody of the respondents/
appellants 3 & 4. Therefore, appellant Nos.1 and 2 are seeking
to appoint them as adoptive parents of the child.
3.  The order-sheet of the trial Court dated 25-11-2021
depicts that appellant Nos.3 and 4, biological parents, came up
with their vakalatnama and also filed memo to the effect that
they have no objection for the petition filed by appellant Nos.1
and 2, adoptive parents.
4. In order to prove the case of appellant Nos.1 and 2,
appellant No.1 examined herself as P.W.1 and marked four
documents as per Ex.P.1 to Ex.P.4(a).          No evidence was
adduced on behalf of appellant Nos.3 and 4, who are
respondent Nos.1 and 2 before the trial Court.
5. Learned Judge of the trial Court upon careful perusal
of the pleadings has framed the following issue:
MFA No. 4617 of 2022
"Whether the petitioners are entitled for permission
to     appoint   them   as   adoptive  parents   and
guardian    of  the   person   of  minor   Inshu  as
contemplated under Sections 7 to 10 and 25 of the
Guardians and Wards Act, 1890, as prayed for
them in their petition?"
6. After considering the oral and documentary evidence
on record, the learned trial Judge, by judgment and decree
dated 31-5-2022 dismissed the petition.      Hence, the present
appeal is filed.
7. We have heard Smt. Haleema Ameen, learned counsel
for the appellants, Sri Vijayakumar A. Patil, learned Additional
Government Advocate, along with Sri Kiran Kumar, learned
High Court Government Pleader, for the respondent-State.
8. On 23-11-2022, this Court requested Sri Vijayakumar
A. Patil, learned Additional Government Advocate, along with
Sri Kiran Kumar, learned High Court Government Pleader, to
assist the Court with reference to the Rules made by the State
Government under Section 35 of the Juvenile Justice (Care and
Protection of Children) Act, 2015.
II.  Arguments advanced by the learned counsel
for the appellants
9. Learned counsel for the appellants has contended that
the impugned judgment and decree passed by the trial Court
dismissing the petition filed by appellant Nos.1 and 2 to appoint
them as adoptive parents and guardians is erroneous and the
same cannot be sustained and is liable to be set aside. She has
further contended that the trial Court failed in appreciating the
sanctity of the fact that the adoptive parents of the child and
the biological parents had entered into an agreement with
respect of adopting the child in question even before the child
was born on 26-3-2020 and hence, the question of having sold
the child does not arise.
10.   The learned counsel has further contended that
filing of F.I.R. and taking the child into their custody by the
respondent is only for their statistical purpose and not in the
interest of welfare of the child.    Further, the child who was
under the love and care of appellant Nos.1 and 2 is kept under
the shelter of persons unknown to the child and this aspect will
have grave repercussions on the psychological growth of the
MFA No. 4617 of 2022
child.  She has further contended that Section 17 of the Act
emphasizes on the aspect that welfare of the minor child alone
shall be considered while granting custody.     She has further
contended that the petition filed by the adoptive parents is
dismissed only on the ground that the biological parents
belonging to Hindu and leanred      trial court has not stated
anything in respect of applicability of Hindu Adoption and
11.   The further contended that the Apex Court and
several High Courts have held that conversion to different faith
cannot be regarded as a disqualification for custody of the
minor child.  Therefore, she sought to allow the appeal.
III.   Arguments advanced by the learned Additional
Government Advocate for the respondent
12.   Per contra, Sri Vijayakumar A. Patil, learned
Additional Government Advocate, along with Sri Kiran Kumar,
learned High Court Government Pleader, while justifying the
impugned judgment and decree passed by the trial Court, has
contended that at the first instance, the agreement was not
registered one. The appellants cannot have any agreement to
MFA No. 4617 of 2022
an unborn child and it is unknown to law.         Appellant Nos.1
and 2 belong to Muslim community and appellant Nos.3 and 4
belong to Hindu community and thereby, Mohammedan Law
does not recognise adoption. He has further contended that it
is the duty of the Court to consider the welfare of the child, if
really appellant Nos.3 and 4, are being biological parents, were
unable to take care of the child.      Very strangely, appellant
Nos.3 and 4, biological parents, have filed memo through their
counsel stating that they have no objection to the petition filed
by appellant Nos.1 and 2, which raises the doubt of adoption
and thereby, the 3rd respondent was justified in lodging the
complaint before the jurisdictional Police that the child has been
13. He has further contended that sub-section (2) of
Section 17 of the Act provides that 'in considering what will be
for the welfare of the minor, the Court shall have regard to the
age, sex and religion of the minor, the character and capacity
of the proposed guardian and his nearness of kin to the minor,
the wishes, if any, of a deceased parent, and any existing or
previous relations of the proposed guardian with the minor or
MFA No. 4617 of 2022
his property'.     Admittedly, the appellant Nos.3 & 4 are the
biological parents being Hindus and appellant Nos.1 & 2 are the
adoptive parents being Muslims,          have entered into an
unregistered agreement (Ex.P.1) of an unborn child in the form
of adoption which creates a doubt.       Therefore, he sought to
dismiss the appeal.
14.   In view of the aforesaid rival contentions, the only
point that would arise for our consideration in the appeal is:
Whether appellant Nos.1 and 2, adoptive parents,
and appellant Nos.3 and 4, biological parents,
have made out a case to interfere with the
judgment and decree passed by the trial Court?
15.    We have given our anxious consideration to the
arguments advanced by learned counsel for the parties and
perused the entire material on record carefully.
16.    It is undisputed fact that appellant Nos.1 and 2
belong to Muslim community and appellant Nos.3 and 4 belong
to Hindu community.      It is the case of appellant Nos.1 and 2
MFA No. 4617 of 2022
that on 21-3-2020, they have entered into agreement with
appellant Nos.3 and 4 that post delivery of the child, they will
take care of the child and raise the child. In order to verify the
veracity, we have perused the agreement entered between
them. In the agreement for adoption dated 21-3-2020, it is
mentioned that the first party, i.e. appellant Nos.1 and 2 have
adopted the child of the second party, i.e. appellant Nos.3 and
4 and they will raise the child with honour and dignity.    As on
the date of the agreement, the child was in the womb of
appellant No.4 and the child was born on 26-3-2020, i.e. after
five days of the agreement entered into between the parties.
Thereby, both parties entered into agreement in respect of an
"unborn child, which is unknown to law". Condition No.3 in the
agreement is that, the second party will not claim any money
from the first party. Thereby, this clearly depicts that the child
was given in adoption for money. It is also relevant to point
out at this stage that on the basis of the complaint lodged by
the 3rd respondent, Kota Police registered a case against the
appellants and two others, namely Balakrishna and Reshma, in
Crime No.104 of 2021 for the offences punishable under
Sections 80, 81 and 87 of the Juvenile Justice (Care and
MFA No. 4617 of 2022
Protection of Children) Act, 2015. Later, it was transferred to
Karkala Town Police Station and the same was numbered as
Crime No.72 of 2021 for the offences punishable under
Sections 80 and 81 of the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection
of Children) Act, 2015 and under Sections 465, 468 and 420 of
the Indian Penal Code, 1860. The jurisdictional Police, after
holding detailed enquiry, filed charge-sheet on 14-6-2022
before the Principal Civil Judge and Judicial Magistrate First
17.   A careful perusal of the agreement entered into
between the parties clearly depicts that appellant Nos.1 and 2
belong to Muslim community and appellant Nos.3 and 4 belong
to Hindu community and thereby, the Mohammedan Law does
not recognise adoption.    Our view is fortified by the dictum of
the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of DAGADABAI
(DEAD) BY LEGAL REPRESENTATIVES v. ABBAS ALIAS
GULAB RUSTUM PINJARI reported in (2017) 13 SCC 705,
wherein at paragraph No.20, it has held as under:
"20.   Fifth, the defendant having failed to prove
that he was the adopted son of Rustum, had no
MFA No. 4617 of 2022
option but to suffer the decree of dispossession
from the suit land. It is a settled principle of
Mohammedan Law that Mohammedan Law does not
recognize    adoption   (see-Section   347    of  Mulla
Principles of Mahomedan Law, 20th Edition page
18.   It is shocking that an agreement is entered into
between the parties in respect of an "unborn child".       It is for
the District Child Protection Unit to take the responsibility of all
such cases. It is well settled that 'an unborn child has a life of
its own and rights of its own and the rights of unborn are
recognised by law. No doubt, only if the unborn can be treated
as a person, the right to life of the unborn can be equated with
the fundamental right of the mother guaranteed under Article
21 of the Constitution. True, an unborn is not a natural person,
but it is well known that after six weeks, life is infused into the
embryo, thus converting embryo into foetus and once an
embryo evolves into a foetus, the heartbeat starts. In other
words, the unborn has life from the stage it transforms into
foetus. If the unborn has life, though it is not a natural person,
it can certainly be considered as a person within the meaning of
MFA No. 4617 of 2022
Article 21 of the Constitution, for there is absolutely no reason
to treat an unborn child differently from a born child. In other
words, the right to life of an unborn shall also be considered as
one falling within the scope of Article 21 of the Constitution of
India'.   Admittedly, in the present case, as on the date of
agreement, i.e. on 21-3-2020, appellant No.4 was nine months
pregnant and she delivered the child on 26-3-2020, i.e. after
five days of the agreement, thereby the child has a every right
to lead life with dignity and honour as contemplated under
Article 21 of the Constitution of India.
19. Based on the agreement, appellant Nos.3 and 4 filed
the petition before the trial Court for custody.     In all cases,
where a Court is called upon to adjudicate the question as to
whether permission shall be granted to a pregnant woman for
terminating her pregnancy on a plea of infringement of her
fundamental right to life guaranteed under Article 21 of the
Constitution, the Court has to make a balance between the
rights of the mother and the rights of the unborn.       The fact
remains that as on the date of agreement entered into between
the parties, appellant No.4 was in verge of completing nine
MFA No. 4617 of 2022
months of her pregnancy and thereby, the appellants, both
adoptive parents and biological parents, have violated the
rights of the child guaranteed under the provisions of Article 21
of the Constitution of India. Considering the peculiar facts and
circumstances of the case, very agreement for adoption on 21-
3-2020 entered between the parties is invalid document and
the   same    is   not  permissible   under   the   principles  of
Mohammedan        Law.    As   already   stated  supra,   the  3rd
respondent rightly lodged the complaint to the jurisdictional
Police and in turn, they registered a case and now it is pending
on the file of the Principal Civil Judge and Judicial Magistrate
First Class, Karkala. Thereby, we resist to observe anything at
this stage that it is for the concerned Court to proceed to a
logical end in accordance with law.
20. The leaned trial Judge, while considering Ex.P.1 has
recorded a finding that agreement for adoption does not depicts
the welfare of the minor child, and rightly dismissed the
petition in accordance with law. It is relevant to observe at this
stage that, if really appellant Nos.3 and 4, biological parents,
came forward to give the child for adoption due to poverty,
MFA No. 4617 of 2022
they could have surrendered the child to the concerned
authority for the welfare of the child.   Even if that was not
possible, they could have taken care by sending the child to
Government Educational institutions and now, the Government
has introduced various schemes for their day-to-day essential
commodities, thereby the contention of the learned counsel for
appellants that appellant Nos.3 and 4 entered into agreement
for adoption of their child to appellant Nos.1 and 2 due to
poverty cannot be accepted. The Government has introduced
many schemes to overcome, or to streamline the poverty. If
they have self-confidence and respect, they can lead family by
taking loan from Banks and instead of that, appellant Nos.3 and
4 have sold the child in the name of adoption, which cannot be
21. Even under Section 35 of the Juvenile Justice (Care
and Protection of Children) Act, 2015, provides that (1)       a
parent or guardian, who for physical, emotional and social
factors beyond their control, wishes to surrender a child, shall
produce the child before the Committee; (2) if, after prescribed
process of inquiry and counseling, the Committee is satisfied, a
MFA No. 4617 of 2022
surrender deed shall be executed by the parent or guardian, as
the case may be, before the Committee, and (3) the parents or
guardian who surrendered the child, shall be given two months
time to reconsider their decision and in the intervening period,
the Committee shall either allow, after due inquiry, the child to
be with the parents or guardian under supervision, or place the
child in a Specialised Adoption Agency, if he or she is below six
years of age, or a children's home if he is above six years.
22.  When the State Government is providing so many
benefits for the welfare of the Society, that too, for the people
below the poverty and Section 35 of the Juvenile Justice (Care
and    Protection  of  Children)    Act, 2015,  clearly  explains
regarding surrender of the child, the agreement entered into
between appellant Nos.1 and 2 and appellant Nos.3 and 4
cannot be sustained.
23.   Admittedly, from 20-5-2021, the child is in the
welfare custody of Krishna Anugraha Centre, Udupi, and it is
the recognised Centre of the State Government for welfare of
the child.    When we summoned the appellants before this
MFA No. 4617 of 2022
Court, appellant Nos.3 and 4, biological parents, expressed
their willingness to take back their child along with them. If it
is so, it is for them to approach the Child Welfare Committee
and the Child Welfare Committee to take appropriate steps in
accordance with law.
24. For the reasons stated above, the point raised in the
present appeal is answered in the negative holding that the
appellants have not made out a case to interfere with the
judgment and decree passed by the trial Court.
25. In view of the above, we pass the following
i.      The appeal, being devoid of merits, is hereby
ii.      The judgment and decree dated 31-5-2022 passed
in G & W.C. No.9 of 2021 on the file of the
Additional Senior Civil Judge, Udupi, is hereby
MFA No. 4617 of 2022
iii.     It is needless to observe that appellant Nos.3 and 4,
biological parents, to approach the Child Welfare
Committee, if they really want their child back and
it is for the Child Welfare Committee to take
appropriate steps and pass orders in accordance
iv.      If the Child Welfare Committee comes to the
conclusion that after considering all the pros and
cons in handing over the child to appellant Nos.3
and 4, biological parents, then the jurisdictional
Police is directed to monitor appellant Nos.3 and 4
and so that the child is not sold to anyone and
ensure that A3 and A4 shall        take care of the
paramount interest of the child.
