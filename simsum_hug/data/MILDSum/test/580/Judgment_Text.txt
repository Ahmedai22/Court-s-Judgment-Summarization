Heard learned counsel for the petitioner and learned Additional Government
Advocate representing the State of U.P./opposite party no. 1 and perused the
The present petition under Article 227 of the Constitution of India has been filed
by the petitioner with the prayer to quash the order dated 27.03.2019 passed by
learned Principal Judge, Deoria in maintenance petition no.74 of 2016 (Sunita
Vs. Sanjeev), under Section 125 Cr.P.C., Police Station Gauri Bazar, District
Deoria and order passed by learned Principal Judge, Deoria in Execution Case
No.516 of 2021 (Sunita Vs. Sanjeev) arising out of original case no. 74 of 2016.
Brief facts which are required to be stated are that marriage of the petitioner was
solemnized on 23.02.2014 with respondent no. 2, but their marriage was not
successful. On account of acrimonious relationship between them, petitioner left
her to her parental house on 12.06.2015. Thereafter she moved an application
under section 125 Cr.P.C. dated 16.02.2016 claiming maintenance of Rs.40,000/-
per month from the petitioner making allegation of harassment and torture
against him, in which the Family Court vide order dated 27.03.2019 has directed
the petitioner to pay an amount of Rs.1500/- per month as interim maintenance
to the respondent no.2 from the date of order. On non- payment of the interim
maintenance, respondent no.2 has initiated execution proceeding against the
petitioner by moving an application dated 12.07.2021, in which show cause
notice has been issued to the petitioner by the Family Court by order dated
Main substratum of argument of learned counsel for the petitioner is that several
litigation between the parties are going on, therefore Additional Principal Judge,
Family Court, Deoria has committed legal error in granting interim maintenance
of Rs. 1500/- per month to the opposite party no.2, but after advancing his
argument at some length, when the Court put certain query to him, he gave up
his challenge to the aforesaid impugned order dated 27.03.2019 on merit and
confined his submission praying to grant some reasonable time to the revisionist,
so that he may deposit the entire arrears of maintenance amount in installments.
Learned Additional Government Advocate opposed the said prayer of learned
counsel for the petitioner by contending that there is no illegality in the
impugned order dated 27.03.2019.The grounds taken by the petitioner
challenging the impugned order are not sustainable in law.
After having heard the argument of learned counsel for the parties, this Court
feels it appropriate that no useful purpose would be served in keeping this
petition pending before this Court and the same may be disposed of at this stage
itself. Though after some argument the petitioner is not pressing the impugned
order dated 27.03.2019 on merit, but considering the rival submissions of the
parties, I am of the view that the amount of interim maintenance awarded is not
only meager one, but also insufficient for respondent no. 2. It is the duty and
responsibility of the husband to maintain his wife with all dignity. Now a days it
is extremely difficult to conceive that a women would be in a position to
maintain her with the amount of Rs. 1500/- per month. The inherent and
fundamental principle behind Section 125 Cr.P.C. is far amelioration of financial
state of affairs as well as mental agony and anguish that women suffers when
she is compelled to leave her matrimonial home. The Amendment Act 2001
introduced an express provision for grant of "interim maintenance" under
section 125 Cr.P.C. and power has been vested to the concerned Court to order
for making a monthly allowance towards interim maintenance during pendency
of the petition. In view of judgment of the Supreme Court in the matter of
Rajnesh versus Neha and another, (2021) 2 SCC 324, the interim maintenance
has been rightly granted to respondent no. 2, therefore, this Court feels that no
interference is required in the impugned order dated 27.03.2019, as under the
facts of the case, the same does not suffer from any illegality. The relief as
sought by the petitioner in the instant case is hereby refused.
However, considering the alternative prayer of the petitioner, three months' time
is allowed to the petitioner to pay the entire amount of arrears of interim
maintenance to the respondent no.2 pursuant to impugned order dated
27.03.2019, in three equal installments. First, second and third installments shall
be paid on or before 12.02.2022, 12.03.2022 and 12.04.2022. Further the current
amount of interim maintenance from the month of January, 2022 to onwards
shall be paid by the petitioner as per order dated 27.03.2019.
With the aforesaid observations and directions, the instant Petition is disposed
It is clarified that in case of default of payment of interim maintenance as
directed above, the same shall be recovered in accordance with law.
Office is directed to send the copy of this order to the concerned court below as
well as to the respondent no.2 within ten days.
