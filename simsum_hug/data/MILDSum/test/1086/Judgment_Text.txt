For Petitioner(s)         :    Mr. S.S. Ladrecha with
1.     In the wake of instant surge in COVID – 19 cases and spread
of its highly infectious Omicron variant, abundant caution is being
maintained, while hearing the matters in the Court, for the safety
of all concerned.
2.     The present case, originally, was filed as criminal misc. third
bail application. However, upon an application being moved on
behalf of the petitioner seeking to treat the bail application as
criminal revision petition, the same was allowed by this Hon’ble
Court    order   dated    14.03.2022.            Accordingly,    the   said   bail
application was treated and registered as criminal revision
petition, which is listed before this Court for consideration.
3.     The prayer made in the present case, as originally filed,
“It is, therefore, most respectfully and humbly
prayed that this bail application under Section 167 (2)
Crpc. may kindly be allowed and the petitioners may kindly
be ordered to be release on bail in FIR no. 273/2021
registered on 16.10.2021 Police Station Osiyan at district
4.    Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that an F.I.R.,
bearing No. 273/2021 was lodged on 16.10.2021 under Section
363 I.P.C., by one Chhoturam S/o Ramnarayan stating that his
brother’s    daughter,     Sumitra        was       abducted     by   the   present
accused–petitioner       alongwith        other       persons;    whereafter,   the
petitioner was taken into custody on 19.10.2021, and remained as
such for one day, until ordered to be released by the competent
court on 20.10.2021; however, subsequently the petitioner was
again arrested and took into custody. As per learned counsel, the
total period of the petitioner’s custody was beyond the mandated
time period, as prescribed under Section 167(2) Cr.P.C.
Relevant portion of Section 167 Cr.P.C reads as follows: -
167.     Procedure      when             investigation       cannot    be
(2) The Magistrate to whom an accused person is forwarded
under this section may, whether he has or has not jurisdiction
to try the case, from time to time, authorise the detention of
the accused in such custody as such Magistrate thinks fit, for a
term not exceeding fifteen days in the whole; and if he has no
jurisdiction to try the case or commit it for trial, and considers
further detention unnecessary, he may order the accused to
be forwarded to a Magistrate having such jurisdiction:
[(a) the Magistrate may authorise the detention of
the accused person, otherwise than in custody of
the police, beyond the period of fifteen days, if he is
satisfied that adequate grounds exist for doing so,
but no Magistrate shall authorize the detention of
the accused person in custody under this paragraph
relates to an offence punishable with death,
imprisonment for life or imprisonment for a
(ii) sixty days, where the investigation relates to
any other offence, and, on the expiry of the said
period of ninety days, or sixty days, as the case
may be, the accused person shall be released on
bail if he is prepared to and does furnish bail, and
every person released on bail under this sub-
section shall be deemed to be so released under
the provisions of Chapter XXXIII for the purposes
[(b) no Magistrate shall authorise detention of the accused
in custody of the police under this section unless the
accused is produced before him in person for the first time
and subsequently every time till the accused remains in
the custody of the police, but the Magistrate may extend
further detention in judicial custody on production of the
accused either in person or through the medium of
(c) no Magistrate of the second class, not specially
empowered in this behalf by the High Court, shall
authorise detention in the custody of the police.
[Explanation I.—For the avoidance of doubts, it is hereby
declared that, notwithstanding the expiry of the period
specified in paragraph (a), the accused shall be detained in
custody so long as he does not furnish bail.]
[Explanation II.—If any question arises whether an accused
person was produced before the Magistrate as required under
clause (b), the production of the accused person may be
proved by his signature on the order authorising detention or
by the order certified by the Magistrate as to production of the
accused person through the medium of electronic video
[Provided further that in case of a woman under eighteen
years of age, the detention shall be authorised to be in the
custody of a remand home or recognised social institution.]
5.     Learned counsel for the petitioner further submits that the
petitioner is entitled to statutory / default bail, and that his right
to seek the same has accrued on the ground that the period, as
laid down in Section 167 (2) Cr.P.C., of 90 days, was exceeded and
he was kept in custody for a total period of 92 days.
5.1    Learned counsel also submits that the petitioner was
arrested on 19.10.2021 at 11:00 a.m. and was in custody until
20.10.2021      i.e. one     whole       day,      and      from 27.10.2021     to
24.01.2022, and also, he was in custody for 5 days in October, 30
days in November, 31 days in December and 24 days in January,
until the challan i.e. the chargesheet was filed on 24.01.2022.
6.     Learned counsel for the petitioner placed reliance on the
Ors., Criminal Appeal Nos.185-186 of 2022, decided on
07.02.2022, wherein the Hon’ble Apex Court observed as under:-
“8. The only point that arises for our consideration in
this case is whether an Accused is entitled for statutory bail
Under Section 167(2), Code of Criminal Procedure on the
ground that cognizance has not been taken before the expiry
of 60 days or 90 days, as the case may be, from the date of
remand.. . . .
9. . . . . The scheme of the provisions relating to remand of
an accused first during the stage of investigation and
thereafter, after cognizance is taken, indicates that the
legislature intended investigation of certain crimes to be
completed within the period prescribed therein, according to
this Court in Bhikam chand Jain (supra). This Court held that
in the event of investigation not being completed by the
investigating authorities within the prescribed period, the
Accused acquires an indefeasible right to be granted bail, if he
offers to furnish bail. This Court was of the firm opinion that if
on either the 61st day or the 91st day, an Accused makes an
application for being released on bail in default of charge-
sheet having been filed, the court has no option but to release
the Accused on bail. However, once the charge-sheet was filed
within the stipulated period, the right of the Accused to
statutory bail came to an end and the Accused would be
entitled to pray for regular bail on merits.. . . .It was held by
this Court that the filing of charge-sheet is sufficient
compliance with the provisions of proviso (a) to Section
167(2), Code of Criminal Procedure and that taking of
cognizance is not material to Section 167. The scheme of
Code of Criminal Procedure is such that once the investigation
stage is completed, the court proceeds to the next stage,
which is the taking of cognizance and trial. During the period
of investigation, the Accused is under the custody of the
Magistrate before whom he or she is first produced, with such
Magistrate being vested with power to remand the Accused to
police custody and/or judicial custody, up to a maximum
period as prescribed Under Section 167(2). Acknowledging the
fact that an Accused has to remain in custody of some court,
this Court concluded that on filing of the charge-sheet within
the stipulated period, the Accused continues to remain in the
custody of the Magistrate till such time as cognizance is taken
by the court trying the offence, when the said court assumes
custody of the Accused for purposes of remand during the trial
in terms of Section 309, Code of Criminal Procedure. This
Court clarified that the two stages are different, with one
following the other so as to maintain continuity of the custody
of the Accused with a court.
10.    It is clear from the judgment of this Court in
Bhikamchand Jain (supra) that filing of a charge-sheet
is sufficient compliance with the provisions of Section
167, Code of Criminal Procedure and that an accused
cannot demand release on default bail Under Section
167(2) on the ground that cognizance has not been
taken before the expiry of 60 days.
11.. . . . In Sanjay Dutt (supra), this Court held that the
indefeasible right accruing to the accused is enforceable
only prior to the filing of challan and it does not survive
or remain enforceable, on the challan being filed. It was
made clear that once the challan has been filed, the
question of grant of bail has to be considered and
decided only with reference to the merits of the case
under the provisions relating to grant of bail to an
accused after the filing of the challan.. . . .
12.    In Madar Sheikh (supra) … this Court held that the
right conferred on an accused Under Section 167(2)
cannot be exercised after the charge-sheet has been
submitted and cognizance has been taken. . . .
15. A close scrutiny of the judgments in Sanjay Dutt (supra),
Madar Sheikh (supra) and M. Ravindran (supra) would show
that there is nothing contrary to what has been decided in
Bhikamchand Jain (supra). In all the above judgments which
are relied upon by either side, this Court had categorically laid
down that the indefeasible right of an Accused to seek
statutory bail Under Section 167(2), Code of Criminal
Procedure arises only if the charge-sheet has not been
filed before the expiry of the statutory period. Reference
to cognizance in Madar Sheikh (supra) is in view of the fact
situation where the application was filed after the charge-
sheet was submitted and cognizance had been taken by the
trial court. Such reference cannot be construed as this Court
introducing an additional requirement of cognizance having to
be taken within the period prescribed under proviso (a) to
Section 167(2), Code of Criminal Procedure, failing which the
Accused would be entitled to default bail, even after
filing of the charge-sheet within the statutory period. It
is not necessary to repeat that in both Madar Sheikh
(supra) and M. Ravindran (supra), this Court expressed
its view that non-filing of the charge-sheet within the
statutory     period    is    the      ground         for  availing   the
indefeasible right to claim bail Under Section 167(2),
Code of Criminal Procedure. The conundrum relating to the
custody of the Accused after the expiry of 60 days has also
been dealt with by this Court in Bhikamchand Jain (supra). It
was made clear that the Accused remains in custody of the
Magistrate till cognizance is taken by the relevant court.. . . ”
6.2   Suresh     Kumar        Bhikamchand                 Jain  Vs.   State    of
Maharashtra and Ors. (2013) 1 SCC (LS) 480 wherein the
Hon’ble Apex Court, with regard to the provision of law laid down
in Section 167 Cr.P.C, observed as under:-
“From the above provision, it would be amply clear that
the Magistrate may authorise the detention of an accused
person, otherwise than in the custody of the police, beyond a
period of 15 days, if he is satisfied that there are adequate
grounds for doing so, but no Magistrate is authorised to detain
the accused person in custody for a total period exceeding 90
days where the investigation relates to an offence punishable
with death, imprisonment for life or imprisonment for a term of
not less than ten years and, 60 days where the investigation
relates to any other offence. In other words, if an accused was
ready to offer bail, once the stipulated period for the
investigation had been completed, then the Magistrate no
longer had the authority to extend the period of detention
beyond the said period of 90 days and, consequently, he
had no option but to release the accused on bail. The
language used in Sections 167(2)(a)(i) and (ii) is that on
the expiry of the period of 90 days or 60 days, as the case
may be, the accused person shall be released on bail, if he
is prepared to and does furnish bail. The direction upon the
learned Magistrate or the Trial Court is mandatory in nature and
any detention beyond the said period would be illegal.
…once a charge-sheet is filed within the stipulated time, the
question of grant of default bail or statutory bail does not
arise.. . .Whether cognizance is taken or not is not material as
far as Section 167 Code of Criminal Procedure is concerned. . .
The scheme of the Code of Criminal Procedure is such that once
the investigation stage is completed, the Court proceeds to the
next stage, which is the taking of cognizance and trial. An
accused has to remain in custody of some court. During the
period of investigation, the accused is under the custody of the
Magistrate before whom he or she is first produced. During that
stage, under Section 167(2) Code of Criminal Procedure, the
Magistrate is vested with authority to remand the accused to
custody, both police custody and/or judicial custody, for 15 days
at a time, up to a maximum period of 60 days in cases of
offences punishable for less than 10 years and 90 days where
the offences are punishable for over 10 years or even death
sentence. In the event, an investigating authority fails to file the
charge-sheet within the stipulated period, the accused is entitled
to be released on statutory bail. In such a situation, the accused
continues to remain in the custody of the Magistrate till such
time as cognizance is taken by the Court trying the offence,
when the said Court assumes custody of the accused for
purposes of remand during the trial in terms of Section 309 Code
of Criminal Procedure. The two stages are different, but one
follows the other so as to maintain a continuity of the custody of
the accused with a court.”
7.    On the other hand, learned Public Prosecutor opposes, and
submits that the learned Court below, vide the impugned order,
has rightly held that once a charge sheet has been filed and
cognizance has also been taken against the accused–petitioner,
the right to claim bail under Section 167 (2) Cr.P.C. does not
subsist.  And    that,   since     the      accused–petitioner    made    the
application seeking default/statutory bail after the charge sheet
was filed, he relinquished his right to seek bail as a matter of right
8.    Learned Public Prosecutor placed reliance on the following
8.1   Sanjay Dutt Vs. State through C.B.I. Bombay (1994) 5
SCC 410, relevant portion of which reads as under:
“(2)(b) The 'indefeasible right' of the accused to be
released on bail in accordance with Section 20(4)(bb) of the
TADA Act read with Section 167(2) of the CrPC in default of
completion of the investigation and filing of the challan within
the time allowed, as held in Hitendra Vishnu Thakur is a right
which enures to, and is enforceable by the accused only from
the time of default till the filing of the challan and it does not
survive or remain enforceable on the challan being filed. If the
accused applies for bail under this provision on expiry of the
period of 180 days or the extended period, as the case may
be, then he has to be released on bail forthwith. The accused,
so released on bail may be arrested and committed to custody
according to the provisions of the CrPC. The right of the
accused to be released on bail after filing of the challan,
notwithstanding the default in filing it within the time
allowed, is governed from the time of filing of the
challan only by the provisions relating to the grant of
bail applicable at that stage.”
8.2  Mohamed Iqbal Madar Sheikh and Ors. Vs. State of
Maharashtra (1996) 1 SCC 722, relevant portion of which reads
“So far the facts of the present case are concerned, the
appellant Nos. 1 to 6 were taken into custody on 16.1.1993.
The charge-sheet was submitted on 30.8.1993; obviously
beyond the statutory period under Section 20(4)(b). There is
nothing on record to show that provisions of Section 20(4(bb)
were applied in respect of appellants. They had become
entitled to be released on bail under proviso (a) to Section
167(2) of the Code read with Section 20(4)(b) of the TADA.
But it is an admitted position that no application for bail
appellants. Unless applications had been made on
behalf of the appellants, there was no question of their
being released on ground of default in completion of the
investigation within the statutory period.”
9.    The contention of the learned counsel for the petitioner that
the period, during which the accused–petitioner was arrested for
the first time, and detained in custody, before which the additional
offences were added by the investigation officer, would be
computed and therefore the total period of detention of the
accused person in custody would exceed 90 days, making him
entitled to default/statutory bail.
10.   Heard learned counsel for the parties as well as perused the
record of the case and the judgments cited at the Bar.
11.   This Court therefore observes that the following two issues
11.1 Whether the learned Court below, in computing the
total period of detention of accused person as under Section 167
(2) Cr.P.C. , during which the accused – applicant was in custody,
was right to exclude the period during which he was previously
remained in custody, and subsequently released on bail i.e. before
which the additional offences against him were found to be made
out by the investigating officer.
11.2 Whether a bail application, under Section 167 (2)
Cr.P.C., seeking default/statutory bail, filed after the charge sheet,
although the charge sheet has been filed after the expiry of the
prescribed statutory time limit under Section 167 (2) Cr.P.C.,
would be maintainable.
12.   This Court observes that the accused–petitioner was initially
arrested on 19.10.2021, in connection with alleged commission of
offence under Section 363 I.P.C. and was presented before a
Magistrate and was granted bail on 20.10.2021. Subsequently,
during the period of investigation, the investigating officer filed an
application under Section 437(3) Cr.P.C. before the Judicial
Magistrate, Osiyan upon finding that the accused– petitioner had
allegedly committed offences under other Sections of the I.P.C.,
namely Sections 457, 342,           366A, 376(2)(n), 376D, along with
offences under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences
Act, 2012 (POCSO), namely Sections 3/4, 5(G)/6 which was
accepted by the learned Magistrate vide order dated 26.10.2021,
while granting permission to the investigating officer to arrest the
petitioner. In pursuance of the said order, the petitioner was
arrested again on 27.10.2021, and after being presented before
the learned Court below on 28.10.2021,                      he was remanded to
police   custody.   Subsequently,          on      31.10.2021     the   accused-
petitioner was remanded to judicial custody. The charge sheet was
filed on 24.01.2022.
13.    This Court further observes that the impugned order, dated
24.02.2022, passed by the learned Court below, states that the
accused–petitioner made an application seeking bail before the
learned Court below, on 22.02.2022, after the charge sheet was
filed, and cognizance of the offences mentioned in the F.I.R. was
taken against him, which was within the stipulated period of 90
days as laid down in Section 167 (2) Cr.P.C., which was computed
14.    This Court is also conscious of the law laid down by the
Hon’ble Apex Court in the following judgments: -
14.1 Achpal & Ors. Vs. State of Rajasthan (2019) 14 SCC
599, relevant portion of which reads as under:
“It   is  thus    clearly     indicated        that    the  stage   of
investigation ought to be confined to 90 or 60 days, as the
case may be, and thereafter the issue relating to the custody
of the Accused ought to be dealt with by the Magistrate on the
basis of the investigation. Matters and issues relating to liberty
and whether the person Accused of a charge ought to be
confined or not, must be decided by the Magistrate and not by
the Police. The further custody of such person ought not to be
guided by mere suspicion that he may have committed an
offence or for that matter, to facilitate pending investigation.
The fact of the matter is that as on completion of 90 days of
prescribed period Under Section 167 of the Code there were
no papers of investigation before the concerned Magistrate.
The Accused were thus denied of protection established by
law. The issue of their custody had to be considered on merits
by the concerned Magistrate and they could not be simply
remanded to custody dehors such consideration.
The provisions of the Code do not empower anyone to
extend the period within which the investigation must
be completed nor does it admit of any such eventuality.
There     are  enactments          such       as     the    Terrorist   and
Disruptive     Activities      (Prevention)              Act,   1985    and
Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act, 1999
which clearly contemplate extension of period and to
that   extent     those     enactments             have     modified    the
provisions of the Code including Section 167. In the
absence of any such similar provision empowering the
Court to extend the period, no Court could either
directly or indirectly extend such period.
We must at this stage note an important feature. In Rakesh
Kumar Paul (supra), in his conclusions, Madan B. Lokur, J.
The Petitioner is held entitled to the grant of "default
bail" on the facts and in the circumstances of this
case. The trial Judge should release the Petitioner on
"default bail" on such terms and conditions as may
be reasonable. However, we make it clear that this
does not prohibit or otherwise prevent the arrest or
re-arrest of the Petitioner on cogent grounds in
respect of the subject charge and upon arrest or re-
arrest, the Petitioner is entitled to petition for grant
of regular bail which application should be considered
on its own merit. We also make it clear that this will
not impact on the arrest of the Petitioner in any
other case.”
14.2 Rakesh Kumar Paul Vs. State of Assam (2017) 15 SCC
67   wherein    the    Hon’ble       Apex       Court        made    the   following
“The significance of the period of 60 days or 90 days, as
the case may be, is that if the investigation is not
completed      within       that     period        then     the    Accused
(assuming he or she is in custody) is entitled to 'default
bail' if no charge sheet or challan is filed on the 60th or
90th day, the Accused applies for 'default bail' and is
prepared to and does furnish bail for release.
Ever since 1898, the legislative intent has been to conclude
investigations within twenty-four hours. This intention has not
changed for more than a century, as the marginal notes to
Section 167 of the Code of Criminal Procedure suggest.
However, the Legislature has been pragmatic enough to
appreciate   that    it  is   not    always        possible   to   complete
investigations into an offence within twenty-four hours.
Therefore initially, in the Code of Criminal Procedure of 1898,
a maximum period of 15 days was provided for completing the
investigations. Unfortunately, this limit was being violated
through the subterfuge of taking advantage of Section 344 of
the Code of Criminal Procedure of 1898. The misuse was
recognized in the 41st Report of the Law Commission of India
and consequently the Law Commission recommended fixing a
maximum period of 60 days for completing investigations and
that recommendation came to be enacted as the law in the
Code of Criminal Procedure of 1973. Subsequently, this period
was also found to be insufficient for completing investigations
into more serious offences and, as mentioned above, the
period for completing investigations was bifurcated into 90
days for some offences and 60 days for the remaining
Notwithstanding this, the basic legislative intent of completing
investigations within twenty-four hours and also within an
otherwise time-bound period remains unchanged, even though
that period has been extended over the years. This is an
indication that in addition to giving adequate time to complete
investigations, the Legislature has also and always put a
premium on personal liberty and has always felt that it would
be unfair to an Accused to remain in custody for a prolonged
or indefinite period.
What is forgotten is that the indefeasible right for 'default bail'
accrued to the Petitioner when the period of 60 days for
completing the investigation and filing a charge sheet came to
an end on 3rd or 4th January, 2017 and that the indefeasible
right continued till 24th January, 2017. The question is
whether during this interregnum the Petitioner was entitled to
'default bail' or not? Ordinarily, the answer would be "yes" but
in the present case, the Petitioner was not granted bail and a
charge sheet was filed against him on 24th January, 2017.
Was his indefeasible right completely taken away?
The Constitution Bench in Sanjay Dutt made it clear in
paragraph 48 of the Report that the indefeasible right
accruing to the Accused is enforceable only prior to the
filing of the charge sheet and it does not survive or
remain enforceable thereafter, if already not availed of.
In other words, the Constitution Bench took the view
that the indefeasible right of 'default bail' continues till
the   charge     sheet      or    challan        is   filed   and   it gets
extinguished thereafter.
This Court had occasion to review the entire case law on the
subject in Union of India v. Nirala Yadav MANU/SC/0580/2014
: (2014) 9 SCC 457. In that decision, reference was made to
Uday     Mohanlal      Acharya          v.     State       of   Maharashtra
MANU/SC/0222/2001 : (2001) 5 SCC 453 and the conclusions
arrived at in that decision. We are concerned with conclusion
(3) On the expiry of the said period of 90 days or 60
days, as the case may be, an indefeasible right accrues
in favour of the Accused for being released on bail on
account of default by the investigating agency in the
completion of the investigation within the period
prescribed and the Accused is entitled to be released
on bail, if he is prepared to and furnishes the bail as
directed by the Magistrate.
This Court also dealt with the decision rendered in Sanjay Dutt
and     noted    that    the     principle         laid    down    by   the
Constitution Bench is to the effect that if the charge
sheet is not filed and the right for 'default bail' has
ripened into the status of indefeasibility, it cannot be
frustrated by the prosecution on any pretext. The Accused can
avail his liberty by filing an application stating that the
statutory period for filing the charge sheet or challan has
expired and the same has not yet been filed and therefore the
indefeasible right has accrued in his or her favour and further
the Accused is prepared to furnish the bail bond.
It is not as if the Petitioner did not make any application for
default bail-such an application was definitely made (if not in
writing) then at least orally before the High Court. In our
opinion, in matters of personal liberty, we cannot and should
not be too technical and must lean in favour of personal
liberty. Consequently, whether the Accused makes a written
application for 'default bail' or an oral application for 'default
bail' is of no consequence. The concerned court must deal with
such an application by considering the statutory requirements
namely, whether the statutory period for filing a charge sheet
or challan has expired, whether the charge sheet or challan
has been filed and whether the Accused is prepared to and
does furnish bail. 41. We take this view keeping in mind that
in   matters    of   personal      liberty     and      Article 21  of   the
Constitution, it is not always advisable to be formalistic or
… it would equally be the duty and responsibility of a court on
coming to know that the Accused person before it is entitled to
'default bail', to at least apprise him or her of the indefeasible
right. A contrary view would diminish the respect for personal
liberty, on which so much emphasis has been laid by this
… when the High Court dismissed the application for bail filed
by the Petitioner, he had an indefeasible right to the grant of
'default bail' since the statutory period of 60 days for filing a
charge sheet had expired, no charge sheet or challan had
been filed against him (it was filed only on 24th January,
2017) and the Petitioner had orally applied for 'default bail'.
Under these circumstances, the only course open to the High
Court on 11th January, 2017 was to enquire from the
Petitioner whether he was prepared to furnish bail and if so
then to grant him 'default bail' on reasonable conditions.
Unfortunately, this was completely overlooked by the High
It would have been another matter altogether if the
Petitioner had not applied for 'default bail' for whatever
reason during this interregnum”
of Revenue Intelligence (2021) 2 SCC 485 wherein the
“The right to be released on default bail continues to
remain enforceable if the Accused has applied for such
bail, notwithstanding pendency of the bail application; or
subsequent filing of the chargesheet or a report seeking
extension of time by the prosecution before the Court; or filing
of the chargesheet during the interregnum when challenge to
the rejection of the bail application is pending before a higher
15.   This Court further observes, as aforementioned, that the
accused-petitioner was first arrested and taken into custody for a
period of one day, when an offence under Section 363 I.P.C. was
found to be made out against him. And that the accused-petitioner
was produced before a Magistrate the very next day, and was
granted bail on 20.10.2021, the same day.
16.   It is clear from the record, and from what has been
enumerated above that the petitioner was, after the aforesaid
order, re-arrested on 27.10.2021 upon fresh inclusion of the
alleged offences under Sections 457, 342, 366A, 376(2)(n), 376D
IPC, along with Sections 3/4, 5(G)/6 of the POCSO Act, and the
charge-sheet was filed on 24.01.2022.
17.   A bare perusal of Section 167 (2) Cr.P.C. reveals that under
sub-section (2) (a) (I) of 167 Cr.P.C., the period of 90 days would
be computed when the investigation, with regard to that particular
offence(s), began. The offence under Section 363 I.P.C. would
attract the application of Section 167 sub-section (2) (a) (ii) of
Cr.P.C. since the maximum / upper limit period of imprisonment
under the said section would be 60 days. Regardless of that fact,
this Court finds that if an additional or new offence(s) are found to
be made out by the investigating authority, against an accused,
then the computation of the period, as laid down under Section
167 Cr.P.C. would be done afresh.
17.1 Owing to the present facts and circumstances, such is the
position in the present case, wherein new offences were found to
be made out against the accused–petitioner, by the investigating
officer during the course of investigation.
18.   This Court, in light of the aforementioned, finds that the
learned    Court   below,      after       appreciating        relevant   judicial
precedents, has rightly found that the total period of detention of
the accused-petitioner have to begun from 27.10.2021, until when
the charge sheet was filed on 24.01.2022. And therefore, the
charge sheet was rightly filed within the stipulated 90 days’ time
period as laid down under Section 167 (2) (a) (I) Cr.P.C.
19.    In the present case, the accused–petitioner preferred an
application seeking bail, under Section 167 (2) Cr.P.C, on
22.02.2022 before the learned court below, at a belated stage of
about 29 days after the charge sheet was                            filed, i.e. on
20.    Thus, the first issue is answered as that the period of 90
days is stated to be counted when the investigation for the fresh
offence(s) is started and not from the date of lodging of the FIR.
20.1 The second issue once attached to the controversy is also
answered in the following paragraphs in accordance with the
settled law as laid down by the Hon’ble Apex Court.
21.    In Suresh Kumar Bhikamchand Jain (supra), the Hon’ble
Apex Court reiterated the decision of the Hon’ble Constitution
Bench in Sanjay Dutt (supra) stating that the right to
default/statutory bail accrues to the accused, and gains the status
of an ‘indefeasible right’ only after the expiry of the total period as
laid down in Section 167 (2) Cr.P.C. and until the charge-sheet is
subsequently filed.
21.1 The Hon’ble Apex Court in Sanjay Dutt (supra), laid down
in   clear  and   cogent      terms       that      the     indefeasible   right   of
default/statutory    bail,   accruing        to      the     accused,   who    is  in
detention/custody, is enforceable only prior to filing of the charge-
sheet and it does not survive once the charge-sheet has been
filed; unless, the said right had already been availed of.
21.2 This implies that if the accused had made an application
seeking bail under Section 167(2) Cr.P.C. after the expiry of the
total period laid down in the said provision, but before the charge-
sheet is filed, the pendency of such an application would not affect
his right to seek such bail, even in case of filing of the charge-
sheet prior to adjudication on such application.
22.   In both the aforesaid cases, and in Mohamed Iqbal Madar
Sheikh (supra), the Hon’ble Apex Court held that the said right
to seek default/statutory bail may be availed only after an
application for the same has been made by the accused, or on
behalf of the accused–applicant before the concerned Magistrate.
23.   Further, in Achpal (supra) it has been clarified that unless
an extension to such a total period of detention of an accused, as
laid down under Section 167 (2) Cr.P.C, was prescribed by a
particular statute, the Courts would not be empowered to grant
any extension of time for detention of an accused or overlook the
delay in filing the charge sheet in case an application seeking bail
by the accused person(s) has been preferred.
24.   The Hon’ble Apex Court, in Rakesh Kumar Paul (supra),
after delving deep into statutory interpretation of legislation, and
the right to life and personal liberty of an accused, and in M.
Ravindran (supra), reinforced the ratio decidendi, as laid down
in aforementioned case laws, and held that the indefeasible right
accruing to the accused is enforceable only prior to the filing of
the    charge     sheet,     and       therefore,          the  right   to    seek
default/statutory bail only remains until the charge sheet is filed,
and is extinguished as soon as the charge sheet is filed, once the
statutory period as laid down under Section 167 (2) Cr.P.C. has
25.   This Court answers the second issue as that if a bail
application under Section 167(2) Cr.P.C., seeking default/statutory
bail, if filed after filing of the charge-sheet, even if the charge-
sheet has been filed after expiry of the prescribed statutory time
limit, under the said provision of law, would not in fact be
maintainable.
26.    Therefore, what is of utmost significance is whether the
application seeking default/statutory bail under Section 167(2)
Cr.P.C. has been made before filing of the charge-sheet, or not;
and the said right of the accused becomes an indefeasible right
only in the circumstance that the prescribed total period has
expired     and   the    charge-sheet          has       not     been    filed.  Other
surrounding circumstances are however, immaterial solely with
regard to such right, in such attending circumstances.
27.    This   Court    hereby       observes         that      the   right    to  seek
default/statutory bail accrues to the accused in the nature of an
indefeasible    right,    only    if    such       remedy         by   preferring   an
appropriate application has been availed of within the prescribed
window from the date of expiry of total period of detention of
accused person(s) under Section 167(2) Cr.P.C., until filing of the
charge-sheet.
28.    This Court, in light of the praefatus observations, finds that
the impugned order passed by the learned Court below does not
suffer from any legal infirmity so as to warrant any interference by
this Court.
29.    Consequently, the present petition is dismissed. All pending
applications stand disposed of.
