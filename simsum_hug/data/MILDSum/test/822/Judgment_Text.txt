petitioners. Also heard Mr. L.H. Lianhrima, learned senior counsel

the respondent No. 4.
[2.]           This writ petition under Article 226 of the Constitution
of India is filed by the petitioners challenging the Settlement dated
26.09.2015, reached by the parties concerned before the Lok Adalat
sitting held in the Office of the District Level Services Authority,
[3.]           Brief facts of the case may be noticed at the outset.
One Shri. K. Rochhinga was the owner of LSC No. 145 of 1977,
where he constructed his dwelling house. He resided in the said
property during his lifetime. He expired leaving behind his 5 (five)
children i.e., 3 (three) sons and 2 (two) daughters. The original
respondent No. 2 in the instant writ petition who expired on
25.03.2019 was the eldest amongst the 5 (five) children of Shri. K.
Rochhinga (L), while the respondent No. 1 is the second eldest. The
father of the three petitioners i.e., Shri. K. Vanlalmalsawma who
WP(C) No. 86 of 2019                                        2|Page
expired on 06.05.2014 is the youngest amongst the five children of
Shri. K. Rochhinga (L) and even after the death of Shri. K.
Rochhinga, he continued to live in the main house which was
constructed on LSC No. 145 of 1977. Shri. K. Vanlalmalsawma (L)
had two wives. Out of the first marriage with Smt. Biaklianpuii, the
three petitioners were born. From his second marriage with Smt.
Rohlupuii, two children namely, Alex Lalfakawma and Judy Lalrinzuali
were born.
[4.]           Soon after Shri. K. Vanlalmalsawma expired, the
respondent Nos. 1 & 2 filed Title Suit No. 7/2014 against Smt.
Rohlupuii, the second wife of Shri. K. Vanlalmalsawma (L) in the
Court of the Senior Civil Judge, Lunglei claiming for a declaration that
they are the bonafide owner of the land and buildings in respect of
LSC No. 209001/01/39 of 2012 and LSC No. 145 of 1977, including
the buildings located at Lunglawn and Electric Veng respectively and
also other properties left behind by late Shri. K. Vanlalmalsawma. It
was during the pendency of the said Title Suit that the matter was
referred to the Lok Adalat at Lunglei and consequently, a Settlement
dated 26.09.2015 was arrived at by the parties concerned. The
English translation of the Settlement dated 26.09.2015 is abstracted
Both parties are present in the Lok Adalat sitting, the
following are the issues;
Pu K. Vanlaltluanga is the elder brother of Rohlupuii’s husband
viz; K. Vanlalmalsawma. K. Vanlalmalsawma died on 6.6.2014 and
the properties left behind by him have been agreed to be distributed
in the following manner and thus the parties could come to a

1) LSC No. 145 of 1777 located at Electric Veng (which is in
the name of Pu K. Rochhunga (L)

3) The money in K. Vanlalmalsawma’s Lunglei Apex Bank
Account will be equally shared by the following :-

covered by LSC No. 209001/01/39 at 2012 at Lunglawn, Lunglei and
the RCC building standing there until her son Alex Lalfakawma
attains majority as per government laws. As and when Alex
Lalfakawma attains majority, Pi Rohlupuii shall take steps to mutate
the ownership of LSC No. 209001/01/39 of 2012 in the name of Alex
Lalfakawma. Since Alex Lalfakawma is the owner of this land, no one
is permitted to sell or make changes to the said land until he attains
To show that they are agreeable to the settlement made both
parties have subscribed their signatures. The properties to be shared
are to be settled one week from today.
[5.]          Aggrieved with the above agreement, the petitioners
are before this Court through the instant writ petition.
[6.]           Mr. Rosangzuala Ralte, learned counsel for the
petitioners submits that the petitioners are the children of late Shri.
K. Vanlalmalsawma, who expired on 06.05.2014. At the relevant
time, the petitioners were only minors and they were of the bonafide
belief that the respondent Nos. 1 & 2 were taking proper care of
their interest and welfare in respect of the properties and other
belongings left behind by their late father, including LSC No. 145 of
1977, where the main house was situated and in which they were
living. However, to the surprise of the petitioners, they came to learn
that the respondent Nos. 1 & 2 on one side and Smt. Rohlupuii, the
second wife of their father on the other side made a settlement
before the Lok Adalat on 26.09.2015 by distributing the properties
amongst themselves as stated in the settlement and without leaving
any share for the petitioners on the property left behind by their late
[7.]           The learned counsel by referring to the cause title and
contents of the Title Suit No. 7/2014 submits that the declaration of
right and title over the properties mentioned in the suit by the
respondent Nos. 1 & 2 as plaintiffs are clearly the properties left
behind by their late father Shri. K. Vanlalmalsawma. Therefore, the
said settlement could not have been made in their absence and
excluding them from inheriting any of the properties left behind by
their late father. He therefore submits that being aggrieved with the
WP(C) No. 86 of 2019                                         5|Page
same and having no other alternative, the petitioners have filed the
instant writ petition. He submits that a Lok Adalat settlement can be
challenged before a Writ Court, as held by the Apex Court in the case
of State of Punjab & Anr. Vs. Jalour Singh & Ors., reported in (2008)
2 SCC 660. The learned counsel further submits that pursuant to the
settlement, the respondent No. 1 has mutated the LSC No. 145 of
1977 into his name after obtaining Heirship Certificate in the year
2018. Apprehending that they will be ousted from the main house
standing on LSC No. 145 of 1977, the petitioners have filed the
instant writ petition. He thus submits that the impugned settlement
should be set aside and the matter remanded back for re-
consideration by the Trial Court.
[8.]           Mr. L.H. Lianhrima, learned senior counsel on the other
hand submits that a writ does not lie against a private person who
does not have a public duty to perform. In this connection, he relies
upon the case of Radhey Shyam & Anr. Vs. Chhabi Nath & Ors.,
reported in (2015) 5 SCC 423. He further submits that although the
Revenue Department has been made a party respondent in the
present writ petition, but the fact remains that they were not a party
before the Trial Court. The learned senior counsel further submits
that in view of the Apex Court decision in State of Punjab & Anr. Vs.
Jalour Singh & Ors. (Supra), a writ petition under Article 227 may lie
against the settlement made before a Lok Adalat on limited grounds.
However, the instant writ petition is filed under Article 226 of the
WP(C) No. 86 of 2019                                        6|Page
Constitution of India by the petitioners and therefore, the same is
not maintainable.
[9.]           Mr. L.H. Lianhrima further submits that there is
inordinate delay on the part of the petitioners in filing the present
writ petition, inasmuch as, the impugned agreement before the Lok
Adalat was made on 26.09.2015 and by which time, the petitioner
No. 1 in particular having being born on 15.03.1997 was already a
major. Despite the same, the petitioners have only approached this
Court by filing the instant writ petition on 20.06.2019. He submits
that to avail a remedy under Article 226 of the Constitution of India,
the party aggrieved should approach the Court at the earliest
opportunity. The power conferred to the Court being an extra
original power, it is the sole discretion of the Court to entertain the
writ petition and inordinate delay is one of the ground available to
the Court to refuse the exercise of its discretion. Under the facts and
circumstances, the learned senior counsel submits that the writ
petition should be dismissed.
[10.]          Mr. C. Zoramchhana, learned Additional Advocate
General appearing for the respondent No. 4 submits that he has
nothing much to say, inasmuch as, the respondent No. 4 is only a
proforma respondent and has no role to play in the present
[11.]          I have heard the submissions made by the learned
counsels for the rival parties and I have perused the materials
available on record.
[12.]          From what has been narrated hereinabove, it may be
seen that Shri. K. Rochhinga (L) was the original owner of LSC No.
145 of 1977 and he is the grandfather of the petitioners. During his
lifetime, the father of the petitioners was allowed to live in the main
house which is situated on the said LSC. He however expired on
06.05.2014 and the said LSC continued to remain in the name of
Shri. K. Rochhinga (L). In other words, Shri. K. Vanlalmalsawma did
not inherit the property left behind by Shri. K. Rochhinga, his father.
Further, living in the main house by itself cannot imply that the
property of Shri. K. Rochhinga stood transferred to the occupant of
the property/house namely, Shri. K. Vanlalmalsawma. From a perusal
of the pleadings in Title Suit No. 7/2014, it can be seen that the
respondent Nos. 1 & 2 sought for a declaration of their right to title
and ownership over the land and buildings covered by LSC No.
209001/01/39 of 2012 located at Lunglawn, Lunglei and LSC No. 145
of 1977 located at Electric Veng, Lunglei and also the properties left
behind by their deceased brother Shri. K. Vanlalmalsawma in their
favour. The suit was filed against Smt. Rohlupuii, the second wife of
[13.]          During the pendency of the Suit, the same was referred
for settlement before the Lok Adalat and accordingly, vide the
settlement dated 26.09.2015 was arrived at by the parties
WP(C) No. 86 of 2019                                         8|Page
concerned. As per the settlement, LSC No. 145 of 1977 which was in
the name of Shri. K. Rochhinga was given to the respondent No. 1
and likewise, Alto Car bearing registration No. MZ 02 A-0202 was
also given to him. The money in the bank account of Shri. K.
Vanlalmalsawma was to be shared equally by all the 5 (five) children
of late Shri. K. Vanlalmalsawma, including the three petitioners. In
respect of Scooty bearing registration No. MZ 01 A-2239 and LSC No.
209001/01/39 of 2012, the same was given to the defendant Smt.
Rohlupuii with a condition in respect of the LSC that she will mutate
the ownership of the said property in the name of her son, Alex
Lalfakawma once he attains the age of majority. It may be noticed
that the petitioners while praying for setting aside the Settlement
dated 26.09.2015 in this writ petition has mainly sought for the
cancellation of Heirship Certificate No. 311 of 2018 and the mutation
of LSC No. 145 of 1977 in the name of the respondent No. 1.
[14.]          As    already     stated    hereinabove,    Shri.   K.
Vanlalmalsawma during his lifetime did not inherit the land and
property covered by LSC No. 145 of 1977. If such is the case, there
cannot be any basis for the petitioners to make a claim for the said
property on the strength of being the daughters of late Shri. K.
Vanlalmalsawma. It is also noted herein that the petitioner No. 3
during the pendency of this writ petition expired on 24.10.2019 and
therefore, it is only the petitioner Nos. 1 & 2, who remain to make
their claims. Although the petitioners have tried to project that the
respondent Nos. 1 & 2 have committed fraud or mis-represented
WP(C) No. 86 of 2019                                       9|Page
them in respect of the properties left behind by their late father but
however, the fact remains that the petitioners were also given their
share of the money left behind by the late father along with their
other siblings born from their step-mother. The respondent Nos. 1 &
2 in their Title Suit also sought for a declaration of the properties left
behind by late Shri. K. Vanlalmalsawma in their names. Therefore, it
is not a case of fraud or misrepresentation as sought to be projected
by the petitioners.
[15.]           The Apex Court in the case of State of Punjab & Anr.
Vs. Jalour Singh & Ors. (Supra) held that the award made by a Lok
Adalat based on settlement can be challenged by filing a petition
under Article 226 and/or Article 227 of the Constitution of India on
limited ground. In the given facts of that case, the Apex Court found
that the Lok Adalat had exercised a power or jurisdiction which was
not vested in it, since no compromise or settlement was arrived at by
the parties concerned and which was duly signed as a token of
acceptance. In the present case, it cannot be said that the Lok
Adalat had exceeded its jurisdiction or had exercised the powers not
vested in it, since an agreement/settlement was mutually arrived at
and signed by the parties concerned. Therefore, I do not find this
decision to be applicable to the case of the petitioners.
[16.]           Having come to the above findings, I do not find the
necessity to enter into the other technical issues raised by the
learned senior counsel for the respondent Nos. 1 & 2. In the result, I
do not find merit in the writ petition and the same is dismissed.
WP(C) No. 86 of 2019                                          10 | P a g e
[17.]          Before parting with the records, I find it necessary to
provide herein that as there is no dispute to the fact that the
petitioners are residing in the main house situated over LSC No. 145
of 1977, from the time their father late Shri. K. Vanlalmalsawma was
alive, they should be allowed to reside peacefully in the main house
as long as they want to.
