Mr. S. G. Chapalgaonkar, Advocate for Respondent no.2
1.       The appellant takes exception to the order passed by the
learned Commissioner for Workmen’s Compensation and Judge
Labour Court at Latur in Application (WCA) No. 4 of 98 dated
2.       The facts giving rise to the Appeal were that the appellant
was a driver with respondent no.1. Respondent                 No. 1 owned a
truck bearing no. Mh-04-C-6933 and was insured with respondent
no.2. He met with a vehicular accident on 13.04.1997. He
sustained the injury to his femur and toe of the left leg. He was
hospitalised for around twenty days. He sustained 35% physical
disability. He was employed with respondent no.2 on the day of
the accident. He could not work as before the accident. He served
the     notices       to     both  respondents. However,       none       of     the
respondents has paid him the compensation. Hence, he filed an
application        under       Section  3  and  22    of    the      Workmen’s
(“1923 Act”, for short).
3.       The learned Commissioner rejected his Claim for the reason
that the appellant had already approached the Motor Accident
Claims Tribunal and had received the compensation under section
140 of the Motor Vehicles Act 1988; (“M.V.Act”, for short)
therefore, the Claim is barred under section 167 of the M.V. Act.
Hence, this appeal.
4.       The respondents have neither denied the accident nor the
relationship with the appellant. Respondent no.2/insurer objected
that the application is bad for no notice under section 10 of the
1923 Act. However, the learned Commissioner has discarded the
said objection and no appeal or cross-appeal is preferred against
the said finding. It has also objected that the application is hit by
section 167 of the M.V. Act.
5.       Heard the learned counsel Shri. B.R. Kedar for the appellant
and the learned Counsel Shri S.G. Chapalgaonkar for respondent
no.2 at length. None appeared for respondent no.1.
6.       Learned counsel for appellant Shri. Kedar would argue that
the learned Commissioner has misread and misinterpreted section
167 of the M.V. Act. An application under Section 140 of M.V. Act
has been excepted from the bar envisaged in Section 169 of M.V.
Act and an application for compensation either under the
Workmen’s Compensation Act or M.V. Act, is maintainable.                       He
would rely on the case of Maroti Shrawan Manghate vs Smt. Rita
Y. Sapra and Anr. [2018 (1) All MR. 700].
7.       Per    contra,      learned counsel Shri.    Chapalgaonkar            for
respondent no.2 would argue that after the impugned order, the
appellant had filed another application under section 166 of M.V.
Act. The appellant had made the incorrect statement before this
court that the said application had been withdrawn. However, the
copy of the order passed in the said application reveals that the
said application was dismissed for default. The appellant was
exercising        the     remedies   simultaneously      by    suppressing          the
material facts from the court. If the said application had been
withdrawn,         the     situation would   be    different.     But     the     said
application was dismissed for default. Therefore, the application
cannot be considered. There is no substance in the appeal. If the
court concludes that the appeal deserved to be allowed, the
matter should be remitted to the learned Commissioner, as the
application has been decided without answering all the issues
8.       A short point that arises for consideration is, Whether the
compensation granted under chapter X of the M.V. act forfeits the
right of the employee to claim the compensation under section 3
of the 1923 Act as provided under Section 167 of the M.V. Act ?
9.       Before adverting to the issue involved in the appeal, it would
rather be appropriate to reproduce Section 167 of the M.V.Act,
“167. Option regarding claims for compensation in certain cases.
— Notwithstanding anything contained in the Workmen’s
Compensation Act. 1923 (8 of 1923) where the death or bodily
injury to, any person gives rise to a claim for compensation
under this Act and also under the Workmen’s Compensation Act,
1923, the person entitled to compensation may without prejudice
to the provisions of Chapter X claim such compensation under
either of those Acts but not under both.”
10.      The bare reading of the section reveals that the option as
envisaged in section 167 of the M.V. Act is available only to the
employees covered under the 1923 Act. It provides two forums.
The option lies with an employee claiming compensation either
under the 1923 Act or M. V. Act. But, employee cannot claim the
compensation under both the Acts. However, chapter X of the M.V.
Act is excepted from the bar envisaged in Section 169 of M.V. Act.
11.      Chapter X of the M.V. Act deals with liability without fault in
certain cases. Said chapter contains Sections 140 to 144. Section
140 speaks of the liability to pay compensation in certain cases i.e
death and permanent disablement, on the principle of no fault.
Under this section, the person who died or sustained permanent
disablement is entitled to compensation. Section 141 speaks of
the other right to claim compensation for death or permanent
disablement. It has been provided in the said section that the
compensation under this chapter is in addition to the right to claim
compensation under the principle of fault except the right to claim
under      section        163-A of the  M.V.Act.    Section     142       defines
permanent disablement. Section 143 speaks of the application of
this chapter to certain claims under Act 8 of 1923, and Section
144 speaks of the overriding effect of the provisions of this
chapter. As against this, Section 167 of the M.V. Act falls under
chapter XII.           The said chapter includes the provisions for the
constitution of the Claims Tribunal, application for compensation
under section 166 under the principle of fault, the option of the
forum to the employees covered under 1923 Act, awards of the
Claim Tribunal, procedure and powers of the Claim Tribunal,
impleading insurer in certain cases, award of interest, award of
compensatory costs in certain cases, appeals, recovery of money
from the insurer, and the powers of the State government to make
12.      Application of chapter X as envisaged in section 143 and
exception of the applicability of this chapter as envisaged in
section 167 should be read together to answer the point that has
arisen for consideration. Section 143 is very specific that the
provisions of chapter X of the M.V. Act shall apply to any claim for
compensation in respect of the death or permanent disablement to
any person under the 1923 Act resulting from an accident of the
nature involved in sub-section (1) of Section 140 and for the said
purpose the said provisions shall, with necessary modifications
have been deemed to form the part of that Act. The provisions of
the     Sections        are  unambiguous, that     where     the     death        or
permanent disablement is caused to an employee in a vehicular
motor accident, he is entitled to the compensation under the
principle of no fault liability in addition to the compensation under
the principle of fault liability.
13.      Section 167 barely provides for the choice of the forum to
the employee. Section 3 of the 1923 Act pertains to the
employer’s liability to pay compensation. The object of these two
acts is to pay the compensation to an employee if he loses his life
or suffers permanent, partial or permanent total disablement
sustained in a vehicular motor accident. The compensation for
vehicular motor accidents is covered under the M.V. Act. It also
covers the compensation for the driver of the vehicle involved in
the accident. However, in case the driver of such a vehicle is an
employee of the owner of the vehicle. In such a case, the law has
given him an option to seek compensation either under the M.V.
Act or Employee’s Compensation Act, 1923.          Once the employee
exercises an option under either of the law, he can not opt for the
other forum after either forum passes the award.
14.      The words in section 167 of M.V.Act, “Without prejudice to
the provisions of Chapter X” , are self speaking to interpret the
said section that an application decided by the Claims Tribunal
under section 140 of the said Act, does not bar the employee from
availing remedy for compensation under the 1923 Act on the
principles envisaged in the said Act. Reading section 167              would
reveal that chapter X of the M.V. Act has no application while
opting for the forum to claim the compensation. In other words,
the reliefs granted under chapter X of the M.V. Act would not come
in the way of claiming compensation before the Commissioner of
Employee’s Compensation or the Claims Tribunal.
15.      The Bombay High Court at Nagpur Bench, in the case of
Maroti (supra), had an occasion to deal with the similar issue.
Interpreting section 167 of the M.V. Act, it has been observed in
the said case that Section 167 of the M.V. Act gives the option
only to proceed either under M.V. Act or W.C.Act. But it has no
application to Chapter X. The right to claim compensation under
W.C. Act is not forfeited upon receiving compensation on no fault
16.      By discussing the facts and law, this court concludes that
Where the employee receives compensation under Chapter X of
the M.V. Act, his remedy to seek compensation either under the
1923 Act or the M.V. Act cannot be forfeited under section 167.
Such an employee has an option to move an application for
compensation either under the 1923 Act or M.V. Act. Accordingly,
the question that arisen for consideration is answered.
17.      So far as the objection that the application filed under
section 166 of the M.V. Act is concerned, this court is of the view
that     once      the     Commissioner  passes    an    award      under        the
Employee’s Compensation Act 1923, no such application would lie
before the Claims Tribunal. Otherwise, that application also did not
affect      the     remedy   availed    by the     appellant     before         the
18.      The learned counsel Shri Chapalgaonkar has correctly
pointed out that the learned Commissioner did not record the
findings on all issues on merit. Therefore it would be inappropriate
to determine the compensation here.
19.      For the aforesaid reasons, this court is of the opinion that
the learned Commissioner has misread and misinterpreted Section
167 of the M.V. Act and erroneously dismissed the application of
the appellant. Therefore the appeal is allowed, and the impugned
order is quashed and set aside.
20.      Since all the issues have not been answered on merit, the
matter        is    remitted  to   the   Commissioner        of    Employee’s
Compensation at Latur for determination of the compensation
afresh within six months from the receipt of this order.
21.      Records and papers are sent back to the Commissioner of
Employee’s Compensation office at Latur.
22.      No orders as to costs.
