1.    Feeling aggrieved and dissatisfied with the impugned
common judgment and order dated 06.12.2013 passed by the
High Court of Andhra Pradesh at Hyderabad in respective first
appeals No. 1634 of 2001 and other allied appeals, the original
land owners/claimants have preferred the present appeals
seeking enhancement of the amount of compensation for the
lands acquired.
2.    Large extent of land in different survey number in Adrial
Village of Manthani Mandal, Karimnagar District came to be
acquired by the State Government for the benefit of Singareni
Collieries Company Limited. The lands were acquired for the
purposes of excavation of coal. Notification under Section 4(1)
of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894 (hereinafter referred to as ‘the
Act, 1894’) came to be issued on 13.05.1985.          Declaration
under Section 6 of the Act 1894 was issued on 31.07.1985.
The Land Acquisition Officer passed the awards in the year
1987, fixing the market value for the acquired lands at
Rs.7,000/­ per acre for Category 1 – Dry Lands under
Cultivation and at Rs.6000/­ per acre for Category 2 – Dry
Lands Left Fallow.      Not satisfied with the compensation
awarded by the Land Acquisition Officer, the land owners
sought references under Section 18 of the Act, 1894. The land
owners claimed the compensation at Rs.2 lakhs per acre. The
Reference Court fixed the market value at Rs.30,000/­ per acre
and Rs.50,000/­ per acre. The Reference Court also awarded
the compensation @ Rs.15,000/­ per acre towards sub­soil
mineral rights. By the impugned common judgment and order
the High Court has determined and awarded the compensation
@ Rs.80,000/­ per acre considering the market value of the
land Rs.1,23,000/­ per acre and thereafter deducting 1/3 rd.
The High Court has also in addition awarded Rs.10,000/­ per
acre as part of the market value for sub­soil rights.
2.1  Feeling aggrieved and dissatisfied with the impugned
common judgment and order passed by the High Court
determining and awarding the compensation at Rs.80,000/­
per acre and Rs.10,000/­ per acre for sub­soil rights on
account of the coal deposits, the original claimants – land
owners have preferred the present appeals.
2.2  At the outset, it is required to be noted that against the
very impugned common judgment and order the beneficiary –
Singareni Collieries Company Limited approached this Court by
way of special leave petitions which have been dismissed. The
review applications are also dismissed.    Therefore, the short
question which is posed for consideration before this Court is
whether the amount of compensation determined / awarded by
the High Court is required to be enhanced in the appeals
preferred by the original claimants/land owners?
3.   Learned Counsel appearing on behalf of the appellants
has    submitted     that    while  determining/awarding    the
compensation the Hon’ble High Court has not appreciated that
the petitioners were the absolute owners of the land including
the sub­soil minerals and were not merely tenure holders. It is
submitted that therefore while determining the amount of
compensation for the land acquired claim for sub­soil minerals
rights was also required to be considered. It is submitted that
in the impugned judgment and order the Hon’ble High Court
has also specifically given the findings that the nature of
deposits existing on the surface or the sub­soil of a land would
play an important role and if there are any deposits of rare
minerals or precious stones, that would add to the market
value of the land. It is submitted that though the Hon’ble High
Court has observed that it is not proper for the Land
Acquisition Officer or the Civil Court to separately award the
compensation towards sub­soil mineral rights, thereafter it is
observed that it is permissible to take the fact or into account,
while determining the market value.
3.1. It is further submitted by learned counsel appearing on
behalf of the land owners/claimants that even otherwise the
acquisition was solely for the purpose of excavation of the coal
and there was no other purpose for the acquisition and the
entire acquired land is being excavated on the basis of the
estimates of the coal reserves identified therein, the Hon’ble
High   Court   has   erred  in   deducting   1/3rd  towards  the
development. It is submitted that since the entire land is to be
mined, there is no wastage of land on account of any
developmental activities, such as roads, sewage lines, parks etc.
which      are    required     to    be      carved    out     in
industrial/commercial/housing layouts.      It is submitted that
therefore, the deduction from the compensation determined
may not be permissible in absence of any justification for such
deduction as the entire land is having coal reserves. Reliance is
placed upon the decision of this Court in the case of Nelson
Fernandes & Ors. versus Special Land Acquisition Officer
South Goa & Ors. reported in (2007) 9 SCC 447.
4.    Shri A. Mariarputham, learned Senior Advocate appearing
on behalf of the respondents while opposing the present
appeals has submitted that the amount determined by the
Hon’ble High Court which includes Rs.10,000/­ per acre
towards the coal deposits, the same is not required to be
interfered with by this Hon’ble Court.
4.1   Now so far as 1/3rd deduction made by the Hon’ble High
Court from Rs.1,23,000/­ per acre it is submitted that as per
the settled position of law there shall be an appropriate
deduction   towards     the  development and   therefore  1/3 rd
deduction can be said to be just and reasonable deduction
towards the development, which is not required to be interfered
Making above submissions, it is prayed to dismiss the
present appeals by further submitting that as such the appeals
preferred by the respondents ­ Singareni Collieries Company
Ltd. & Ors. have been dismissed by this Court and the
judgment and order passed by this Hon’ble High Court has
been confirmed by this Court.
5.    Heard learned counsel appearing on behalf of the
respective parties at length.
6.   By the impugned common judgment and order the High
Court has determined and awarded Rs.80,000/­ per acre. The
High Court has also granted/awarded Rs.10,000/­ for sub­soil
rights on account of coal deposits.       Feeling aggrieved and
dissatisfied with the impugned common judgment and order
passed by the High Court, the original claimants/land owners
have preferred the present appeals seeking enhancement of the
amount of compensation.
6.1  At the outset, it is required to be noted that so far as the
appeals preferred by the respondents ­ Singareni Collieries
Company Ltd. & Ors., the same have been dismissed by this
6.2  While determining and awarding the compensation at
Rs.80,000/­ per acre the High Court has considered the market
value of the land in question at Rs.1,23,000/­.         However,
thereafter has deducted 1/3rd towards the development charges
etc. and thereafter has awarded the actual amount of
compensation at Rs.80,000/­ per acre. It is the case on behalf
of the claimants/land owners that the lands in question have
been acquired for the benefit of the mining company/ Singareni
Collieries Company Ltd. which is to be used for excavation of
coal. The coal is already existed in the lands acquired. Since
the entire land is to be mined and the coal is to be excavated,
there is no wastage of land on account of any developmental
activities such as roads, sewage lines, parks etc. In that view of
the matter, there is no development required and therefore
1/3rd deduction is not warranted at all.       Identical question
came to be considered by this Court in the case of Nelson
Fernandes (supra) and after taking into consideration the
earlier decision of this Court in the case of Basavva vs. Spl.
Land Acquisition Officer, (1996) 9 SCC 640, in which this
Court has held that the purpose for which acquisition is made
is also a relevant factor for determining the market value and
the purpose for which the land is acquired must also be taken
into consideration, thereafter in paragraph 29 it is observed
“29. Both the Special Land Acquisition Officer, the
District Judge and of the High Court have failed to
notice that the purpose of acquisition is for Railways
and that the purpose is a relevant factor to be taken
into consideration for fixing the compensation. In this
context, we may usefully refer the judgment of this
Court in Viluben Jhalejar Contractor v. State of
Court held that the purpose for which the land is
acquired must also be taken into consideration in fixing
the market value and the deduction of development
charges. In the above case, the lands were acquired
because they were submerged under water of a dam.
Owners claimed compensation of Rs 40 per sq ft. LAO
awarded compensation ranging from Rs 35 to Rs 60 per
sq m. Reference Court fixed the market value of the
land at Rs 200 per sq m and after deduction of
development charges, determined the compensation @
Rs 134 per sq m. In arriving at the compensation,
Reference Court placed reliance on the comparative
sale of a piece of land measuring 46.30 sq m @ Rs 270
per sq m. On appeal, the High Court awarded
compensation of Rs 180 per sq m in respect of large
plots and Rs 200 per sq m in respect of smaller plots.
On further appeal, this Court held that since the lands
were acquired for being submerged in water of dam and
had no potential value and the sale instance relied was
a small plot measuring 46.30 sq m whereas the
acquisition in the present case was in respect of large
area, interest of justice would be subserved by
awarding compensation of Rs 160 per sq m in respect
of larger plots and Rs 175 per sq m for smaller plots.
In Basavva v. Spl. Land Acquisition Officer [(1996) 9
SCC 640 : JT (1996) 5 SC 580] this Court held that the
purpose for which acquisition is made is also a relevant
factor for determining the market value.”
6.3. Applying the law laid down by this Court in the aforesaid
decision to the facts of the case on hand and when the
acquisition is solely for the purpose of excavation of coal and
the entire land is acquired on the basis of the estimates of the
coal reserve identified and the entire land is to be mined and
used and no further developmental activity is required, we are
of the opinion that in the facts and circumstances of the case,
the High Court has erred in deducting 1/3 rd towards the
developmental activities.   The additional amount awarded by
the High Court at Rs.10,000/­ per acre on account of coal
deposits is not required to be interfered with more particularly
when the same has been confirmed by this Court in as much as
the appeals preferred by the respondents have been dismissed
by this Court.
7.   In view of the above and for the reason stated above,
present appeals succeed in part.     It is held that the original
claimants shall be entitled to the compensation for the lands
acquired at Rs.1,23,000/­ per acre with other statutory benefits
which may be available under the provisions of the Act, 1894.
In addition, the original claimants shall also be entitled to
Rs.10,000/­ per acre as awarded by the High Court on account
of coal deposits.
The impugned common judgment and order passed by the
High Court is hereby modified to the aforesaid extent.
Present appeals are partly allowed to the aforesaid extent.
However, in the facts and circumstances of the case there shall
be no order as to costs.
