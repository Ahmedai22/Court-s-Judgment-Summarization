When these applications for condonation of delay in making
and  restoration   of  the   application  for   exemption from
surrendering were listed before me, I enquired from the advocate
for              the   petitioner   the  need    for  seeking  an   exemption  from
surrendering when the order impugned is only a case of cancellation
of bail. He says that the Registry normally insists on filing such
an application and he has no option. When I informed the counsel
that the Rule applies only for Criminal Appeals or Special Leave
Petitions  where    the  petitioner  is   ‘sentenced  to  a term   of
imprisonment’ and not to SLP’s against cancellation of bail, some
lawyers spoke from the Bar and said that they find it prudent to
file such applications instead of arguing with the Registry without
any success.   This is completely unacceptable.
The officers of the Registry must know the Supreme Court Rules
like the back of ones hand.      Order XXII Rule 5, applies only to
cases where the petitioner is ‘sentenced to a term of imprisonment’
and it cannot be confused with simple orders of cancellation of
bail.  What   is   disturbing   is  that   a  large  number of   such
applications for exemptions are routinely filed when there is no
need to adopt such a procedure at all. This has serious consequence
of increasing the burden of lawyers, judges and even the Registry.
This is apart from loss of respect for law.
I find it necessary to note this position after Sri Raghenth
Basant, member of the Bar, has brought to my notice successive
orders passed by the Supreme Court holding that applications for
surrender were wrongly filed and that there was no need to insist
on filing of such applications. The officers could have atleast
take note of the following judicial orders, Kapur Singh Vs. State
of Haryana 2021 SCC Online 586, Dilip Majumder v. Nikunja Das &Anr.
SLP (Crl) Dy. No.6517/2020, Vivek Rai v. High Court of Jharkhand
(2015) 12 SCC 86, K.M. Nanavati v. State of Bombay AIR 1961 SC 112
(para 15) and Mayuram Subramanian Srinivasan v. CBI (2006) 5 SCC
752 (paras 16 to 18), to name a few.
Registrar (Judicial) is directed to issue formal instructions
to  the  concerned    filing,  scrutiny   and  numbering    Sections  with
respect to matters in which Order XX, Rule 3 and Order XXII, Rule 5
will apply.    The officer must also instruct them not to insist on
such applications in other cases.
Coming back to the facts of the present case, we note that the
petitioner was arrested for an offence under Section 420 read with
34 IPC.    He was granted bail by the High Court subject to payment
of an amount.     Upon his failure to pay the amount the High Court
recalled its order granting bail and ordered the petitioner to
surrender. An application to recall that order came to be dismissed
by the impugned order.
A Special Leave Petition was filed against the above referred
order. Along with it an application for exemption from surrendering
is  also   filed.   The  advocate   should   have  known    that  such  an
application    was   totally    unnecessary.    Chamber    Judge   granted
exemption.   However,   as  notice   was   issued  on   the   application,
without a direction to list the case before the regular Court for
admission, the matter kept coming before the Chamber Court.             On
10.08.2021 the Chamber Judge directed that the petitioner must pay
balance   money  within   four   weeks,  if  not,  the   application   for
surrendering will be dismissed without reference to the Court.          As
the amount was not deposited it was assumed that the application
stands dismissed without reference to the Court. It is for this
reason   that   the   Advocate   filed   the  present    application   for
All this happened when there is no mandate in law to seek an
exemption   from   surrendering   at  all.    The   Constitutional  remedy
under   Article    136   is   available    to   the   petitioner   without
surrendering    as   this   is   not   a  case   where   the   accused   is
As this is not a case requiring surrender, there was never a
need  to  file   the   application   for   exemption   from  surrendering.
However,   as   an   order   directing   dismissal    of  the   so  called
application for exemption from surrendering was passed, I shall
recall that order and direct the case to be listed before the
Regular Bench for admission and disposal.
Delay in filing the application for paying balance amount is
condoned. Application (I.A. No.123405/2021) for restoration of I.A.
No.44732/2021 is allowed.
List the case before the Regular Bench for admission.
A copy of this order be sent to Secretary General, Supreme
Court and Secretary, Supreme Court Advocates on Record Association
