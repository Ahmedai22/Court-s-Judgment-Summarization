(2014) 6 Supreme court cases 466
(iii) State of Madhya Pradesh vs. Laxmi Narayan and others
(2019) 5 Supreme court cases 688.
In the case of Gian Singh (Supra) Hon'ble Supreme Court has
held in para No.61 and 62 as follows:
"61. The position that emerges from the above discussion can be
summarized thus: the power of the High Court in quashing a
criminal proceeding or FIR or complaint in exercise of its
inherent jurisdiction is distinct and different from the power
given to a criminal court for compounding the offences under
Section 320 of the Code. Inherent power is of wide plenitude with
no statutory limitation but it has to be exercised in accord with
the guideline engrafted in such power viz.: (i) to secure the ends
of justice, or (ii) to prevent abuse of the process of any court. In
what cases power to quash the criminal proceeding or complaint
or FIR may be exercised where the offender and the victim have
settled their dispute would depend on the facts and circumstances
of each case and no category can be prescribed. However, before
exercise of such power, the High Court must have due regard to
the nature and gravity of the crime. Heinous and serious
offences of mental depravity or offences like murder, rape,
dacoity, etc. cannot be fittingly quashed even though the victim
or victim's family and the offender have settled the dispute. Such
offences are not private in nature and have a serious impact on
society. Similarly, any compromise between thee a victim and the
offender in relation to the offences under special statutes like b
the Prevention of Corruption Act or the offences committed by
public servants while working in that capacity, etc.; cannot
provide for any basis for quashing criminal proceedings
involving such offences. But the criminal cases having
overwhelmingly and predominatingly civil flavour stand on a
different footing for the purposes of quashing, particularly the
offences arising from commercial, financial, mercantile, civil,
partnership or such like transactions or the offences arising out
of matrimony relating to dowry, etc. or the family disputes where
the wrong is basically private or personal in nature and the
parties have resolved their entire dispute. In this category of
cases, the High Court may quash the criminal proceedings if in
its view, because of the compromise between the offender and the
victim, the possibility of conviction is remote and bleak and
continuation of the criminal case would put the accused to great
oppression and prejudice and extreme injustice would be caused
to him by not quashing the criminal case despite full and
complete settlement and compromise with the victim. In other
words, the High Court must consider whether it would be unfair
or contrary to the interest of justice to continue with the criminal
proceeding or continuation of the criminal proceeding would
tantamount to abuse of process of law despite settlement and
compromise between the victim and the wrongdoer and whether
to secure the ends of justice, it is appropriate that the criminal
case is put to an end and if the answer to the above question(s) is
in the affirmative, the High Court shall be well within its
jurisdiction to quash the criminal proceeding.
62. In view of the above, it cannot be said that B.S. Joshi ,Nikhil
Merchants and Manoj Sharma were not correctly decided. We
answer the reference accordingly. Let these matters be now listed
before the Bench(es) Concerned."
In the Case of Narinder Singh (supra) Hon'ble Supreme Court
has held as follows in para No.29:
29. In view of the aforesaid discussion, we sum up and lay
down the following principles by which the High Court would
be guided in giving adequate treatment to the settlement
between the parties and exercising its power under Section 482
of the Code while accepting the settlement and quashing the
proceedings or refusing to accept the settlement with direction
to continue with the criminal proceedings:
29.1. Power conferred under Section 482 of the Code is to be
distinguished from the power which lies in the Court to
compound the offences under Section 320 of the Code. No
doubt, under Section 482 of the Code, the High Court has
inherent power to quash the criminal proceedings even in those
cases which are not compoundable, where the parties have
settled the matter between themselves. However, this power is
to be exercised sparingly and with caution.
29.2. When the parties have reached the settlement and on that
basis petition for quashing the criminal proceedings is filed, the
guiding factor in a such cases would be to secure: (i) ends of
justice, or (ii) to prevent abuse of the process of any court.
While exercising the power the High Court is to form an
opinion on either of the aforesaid two objectives.
29.3. Such a power is not to be exercised in those prosecutions
which involve heinous and serious offences of mental depravity
or offences like murder, rape, dacoity, etc. Such offences are
not private in nature and have a serious impact on society.
Similarly, for the offences alleged to have been committed
under special statute like the Prevention of Corruption Act or
the offences committed by public servants while working in
that capacity are not to be quashed merely on the basis of
compromise between the victim and the offender.
29.4. On the other hand, those criminal cases having
overwhelmingly       and    predominantly      civil  character,
particularly those arising out of commercial transactions or
arising out of matrimonial relationship or family disputes
should be quashed when the parties have resolved their entire
disputes among themselves.
29.5. While exercising its powers, the High Court is to examine
as to whether the possibility of conviction is remote and bleak
and continuation of criminal cases would put the accused to
great oppression and prejudice and extreme injustice would be
caused to him by not quashing the criminal cases.
29.6. Offences under Section 307 IPC would fall in the category
of heinous and serious offences and therefore are to be
generally treated as crime against the society and not against
the individual alone. However, the High Court would not rest
its decision merely because there is a mention of Section 307
IPC in the FIR or the charge is framed under this provision. It
would be open to the High Court to examine as to whether
incorporation of Section 307 IPC is there for the sake of it or
the prosecution has collected sufficient evidence, which if
proved, would lead to proving the charge under Section 307
IPC. For this purpose, it would be open to the High Court to go
by the nature of injury sustained, whether such injury is
inflicted on the vital/delicate parts of the body, nature of
weapons used, etc. Medical report in respect of injuries
suffered by the victim can generally be the guiding factor. On
the basis of this prima facie analysis, the High Court can
examine as to whether there is a strong possibility of conviction
or the chances of conviction are remote and bleak. In the
former case it can refuse to accept the Settlement and quash
the criminal proceedings whereas in the latter case it would be
permissible for the High Court to accept the plea compounding
the offence based on complete settlement between the parties.
At this stage, the Court can also be swayed by the fact that the
settlement between the parties is going to result in harmony
between them which may improve their future relationship.
29.7. While deciding whether to exercise its power under
Section 482 of the Code or not, timings of settlement play a
crucial role. Those cases where the settlement is arrived at
immediately after the alleged commission of offence and the
matter is still under investigation, the High Court may be
liberal in accepting the settlement to quash the criminal
proceedings/investigation. It is because of the reason that at
this stage the investigation is still on and even the charge-sheet
has not been filed. Likewise, those cases where the charge is
framed but the evidence is yet to start or the evidence is still at
infancy stage, the High Court can show benevolence in
exercising its powers favourably, but after prima facie
assessment of the circumstances/material mentioned above. On
the other hand, where the prosecution evidence is almost
complete or after the conclusion of the evidence the matter is at
the stage of argument, normally the High Court should refrain
from exercising its power under Section 482 of the Code, as in
such cases the trial court would be in a position to decide the
case finally on merits and to come to a conclusion as to whether
the offence under Section 307 IPC is committed or not a
Similarly, in those cases where the conviction is already
recorded by the trial court and the matter is at the appellate
stage before the High Court, mere compromise between the
parties would not be a ground to accept the same resulting in
acquittal of the offender who has already been convicted by the
trial court. Here charge is proved under Section 307 IPC and
conviction is already recorded of a heinous crime and,
therefore, there is no question of sparing a convict found guilty
of such a crime."
In the case of State of Madhya Pradesh Vs.Laxmi Narayan
(Supra) held as follows in para No. 15.1 to 15.4:
"15.1 That the power conferred under Section 482 of the Code to
quash the criminal proceedings for the non- compoundable
offences under Section 320 of the Code can be exercised having
overwhelmingly and predominantly the civil character,
particularly those arising out of commercial transactions or
arising out of matrimonial relationship or family disputes and
when the parties have resolved the entire dispute amongst
15.2. Such power is not to be exercised in those prosecutions
which involved heinous and serious offences of mental depravity
or offences like murder, rape, dacoity, etc. Such offences are not
private in nature and have a serious impact on society;
15.3 Similarly, such power is not to be exercised for the offences
under the special statutes like Prevention of Corruption Act or
the offences committed by public servants while working in that
capacity are not to be quashed merely on the basis of compromise
between the victim and the offender;
15.4 Offences under Section 307 IPC and the Arms Act etc.
rwould fall in the category of heinous and serious offences and
therefore are to be treated as crime against the society and not
against the individual alone, and therefore, the criminal
proceedings for the offence under Section 307 IPC and/or the
Arms Act etc. which have a serious impact on the society cannot
be quashed in exercise of powers under Section 482 of the Code,
on the ground that the parties have resolved their entire dispute
amongst themselves. However, the High Court would not rest its
decision merely because there is a mention of Section 307 IPC in
the FIR or the charge is framed under this provision. It would be
open to the High Court to examine as to whether incorporation
of Section 307 IPC is there for the sake of it or the prosecution
has collected sufficient evidence, which if proved, would lead to
framing the charge under Section 307 IPC. For this purpose, it
would be open to the High Court to go by the nature of injury
sustained, whether such injury is inflicted on the vital/delegate
parts of the body, nature of weapons used etc. However, such an
exercise by the High Court would be permissible only after the
evidence is collected after investigation and the charge sheet is
filed/charge is framed and/or during the trial. Such exercise is
not permissible when the matter is still under investigation.
Therefore, the ultimate conclusion in paragraphs 29.6 and 29.7
of the decision of this Court in the case of Narinder Singh
(supra) should be read harmoniously and to be read as a whole
and in the circumstances stated hereinabove"
Learned Counsel for both the parties are present before this
Court and submitted that the charge sheet including the
proceedings of the case be quashed on the basis of compromise
entered into the parties.
The learned A.G.A. has no objection as parties to the dispute
relating to matrimonial mater have entered into compromise.
Considering the facts of the present case as well as the principle
of law laid down by Hon'ble Supreme Court as mentioned
above, matrimonial dispute between the husband and wife
should be a quashed when the parties have resolved their entire
dispute amongst themself through compromise duly filed and
verified by the Court. There is another aspect of the case that
F.I.R. has been lodged under Sections 498-A, 323 IPC and 3/4
D.P. Act, which will come under category specified in para
No.29.4 laid down by Hon'ble Apex Court in Narinder Singh
(supra) and in category specified in para No.15.1 laid down by
Apex Court in State of Madhya Pradesh vs. Laxmi Narayan
and others (supra) regading which proceedings relating to
matrimonial dispute can be quashed in exercise of power under
In view of the discussion made above, it would be unnecessary
to drag these proceeding, as continuation of the criminal
proceeding despite settlement and compromise would amount
to abuse of process of law accordingly, the instant application
under Section 482 Cr.P.C. is allowed on the basis of
compromise dated 16.03.2022 as verified on 30.03.2022. The
proceeding of cognizance order dated 02.08.2021 and charge
sheet No.1 dated 07.04.2021 filed in Case No.9956 of 2021
arising out of Case Crime No.0018 of 2021, under Sections
498-A, 323 of IPC and 3/4 of D.P. Act, Police Station-Mahila
Thana, District-Kannauj including the entire proceedings of the
case are hereby quashed. No order as to costs.
