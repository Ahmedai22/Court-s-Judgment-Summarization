The FIR was lodged by the 2nd respondent alleging
that one Tulasa Ram – accused No.1 was due a sum of
Rs.66,00,000/- (Rupees Sixty Six Lakhs only) and he had
lodged the FIR against the accused No.1 before the
Halasoor Gate Police Station. Such being the case, when
the respondent No.2 and accused No.1 met at Prakash
Café as to settle the matter, at that point of time, the
accused No.1 and petitioner – accused No.2 herein, abused
the 2nd respondent in filthy language and gave threat to
his life and also assaulted him with their hands.
2.    The police after investigation, submitted the
chargesheet against the petitioner and others for the
offences punishable under Section 323, 504, 506 r/w 34 of
3.    The learned Magistrate after accepting the
chargesheet, took cognizance for the aforesaid offences
and issued summons to the petitioner – accused. Taking
exception to the same, this petition is filed.
4.   Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that
the alleged incident had taken place 45 days prior to
lodging of the FIR.        However, there is no plausible
explanation offered in the FIR for the delay in lodging the
FIR.     He further submits that in the absence of any
statement of the employees or customers in the Prakash
Café, recorded under Section 161 of IPC, the chargesheet
filed by the police in the absence of any corroborative
material is without any substance.
5.    Learned HCGP appearing for the State would
submit that the chargesheet material clearly discloses the
commission of the aforesaid offences alleged against the
petitioner and the same does not warrant any interference
by this Court.
6.    I have considered the submissions made by
learned counsel appearing for the parties.
7.    The FIR was lodged alleging that one and half
months back the petitioner and other accused abused him
in filthy language and assaulted him. However, there is no
plausible explanation offered in the impugned FIR for the
delay in lodging the FIR.
8.    The Apex Court in the case of State of AP vs.
M.Madhusudhan Rao, reported in (2008) 15 SCC 582, at
para 30 has held as follows:
“30. Time and again, the object and importance
of prompt lodging of the first information report
has been highlighted. Delay in lodging the first
information report, more often than not, results
in embellishment and exaggeration, which is a
creature of an afterthought.     A delayed report
not   only   gets   bereft  of the  advantage     of
spontaneity, the danger of the introduction of a
coloured version, an exaggerated account of the
incident or a concocted story as a result of
deliberations and consultations, also creeps in,
casting    a   serious   doubt  on   its  veracity.
Therefore, it is essential that the delay in
lodging    the   report  should  be   satisfactorily
explained.”
9.     In the absence of any plausible explanation
offered by the 2nd respondent – informant, the FIR lodged
against the petitioner – accused is with malice and without
any probable cause.       Even otherwise, to constitute the
commission of the offence punishable under Section 323 of
IPC, the police have not placed any material that the
respondent No.2 sustained any simple injuries due to the
alleged assault made by the petitioner – accused.
10.   To  constitute   the   commission    of offence
punishable under Section 504 and 506 of IPC, the intention
of insult must be of such a degree to provoke breach of
public peace or commission of any other offence. In the
present case, the abusive language alleged to have been
used by the petitioner – accused has not caused breach of
public peace or commission of any other offences. In view
of the same, it would be an abuse of process of law, if the
criminal proceedings are allowed to be continued against
the petitioners, since the probability of conviction of the
petitioner – accused No.2 is remote and bleak.
Accordingly, I proceed to pass the following:
Criminal petition is allowed.
C.C.No.20068/2015 pending on the file of
I ACMM, Bengaluru City insofar it relates
to petitioner – accused No.2 is hereby
quashed.
