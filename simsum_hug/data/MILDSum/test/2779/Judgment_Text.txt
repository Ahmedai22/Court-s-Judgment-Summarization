1.          The present writ petition under Article 32 of the Constitution of
India has been preferred by the daughter and the wife of the deceased –
Y.S. Vivekananda Reddy, seeking transfer of trial arising out of RC-
04(S)/2020/CBI/SC-III/New Delhi from CBI Special Court, Kadapa,
Andhra Pradesh to the CBI Special Court, Hyderabad or CBI Special
Court, New Delhi, and also to direct the CBI for duly completing the
investigation in the aforesaid FIR in a time bound manner.
2.     Shri Siddharth Luthra, learned Senior Advocate appearing on
behalf of the petitioners has submitted that the incident pertains to the
mysterious death of late Shri Y.S. Vivekananda Reddy, the brother of
late Shri Y.S. Rajasekhara Reddy (former Chief Minister of the united
State of Andhra Pradesh) and uncle of Shri Y.S. Jaganmohan Reddy,
the present Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh and the opposite leader at
the time of the incident.
2.1    It is submitted that the deceased was brutally murdered on the
intervening night of 14-15/03.2019 in his house. It is submitted that the
then State Government constituted a Special Investigation Team (SIT).
However, subsequently, petitioner No.2 and Shri Y. Jaganmohan Reddy
filed petitions before the High Court of Andhra Pradesh for transfer of
investigation to the CBI. It is submitted that thereafter the elections to
the State Assembly were held on 11.04.2019 and Shri Y. Jaganmohan
Reddy became the Chief Minister and took oath on 30.05.2019.
Thereafter, the SIT was re-constituted twice, but there was no progress
in the investigation and therefore petitioner No.1 was constrained to
approach the High Court to transfer the investigation to the CBI.
However, Shri Y. Jaganmohan Reddy withdrew his petition for
transferring the investigation to the CBI and the State also opposed such
transfer.    However, the High Court was pleased to transfer the
investigation to the CBI.
2.2    It is submitted that thereafter and after the CBI took over the
investigation, there was substantial progress and in the course of time,
five accused have been arrested and the chargesheet and the
supplementary chargesheet have been filed.            It is submitted that
however, though in the chargesheet, the role of one Y.S. Avinash
Reddy, who is a sitting Member of Parliament from the ruling party in
Andhra Pradesh came to light and he was mentioned as a suspect and
he played a key role in the destruction of the evidence and spreading
false news that the deceased died due to heart attack, the said Y.S.
Avinash Reddy has not yet been arrested and the State authorities and
the influential people in the State are using all kinds of tactics to scuttle
the investigation with the aim to shield the said Y.S. Avinash Reddy and
his close associate D. Shiv Shankar Reddy (A5). It is submitted that not
only that, a false complaint came to be filed against the officers of the
CBI and the CBI officers were constrained to approach the High Court
against the said complaint and the High Court was pleased to stay all
further proceedings. It is submitted that however the investigation has
been stalled due to the pendency of the complaint and the CBI officers
leaving Andhra Pradesh. It is submitted that thereafter the CBI officers
have not resumed investigation anticipating more false complaints at the
behest of the accused and interference by the State authorities if they
resume investigation by travelling to Andhra Pradesh.
2.3    It is submitted that the people involved in the crime, with the aid
and active participation of the State authorities and influential people in
the State are making conscious efforts to scuttle the investigation and
protect the culprits by influencing the witnesses, the investigation, and
the judicial process.
2.4    It is submitted that the lives of the key witnesses and accused,
specially one Shaik Dastagiri (A4) and one Ranganna (PW61) are in
danger. It is submitted that one of the key witnesses has died in a
suspicious manner.
2.5    It is submitted that one of the witnesses who initially agreed to give
his statement under Section 164 Cr.P.C. has been subsequently scared
and he has been taken back on duty and thereafter he has refused to
give his statement under Section 164 Cr.P.C.           It is submitted that
therefore all pressure tactics are being adopted not to further investigate.
It is submitted that as the witnesses are under threat, the petitioners are
apprehending that they may not get justice and therefore it is prayed to
transfer the trial either to New Delhi or Hyderabad.
2.6    It is further submitted that even some witnesses are provided with
special security considering life threat perception to them. It is submitted
that therefore the petitioners have reasonable apprehension that there
shall not be any fair and independent trial if the same is continued at CBI
3.     Shri K.M. Nataraj, learned Additional Solicitor General of India has
appeared on behalf of the respondent -CBI. A counter affidavit has been
filed on behalf of the CBI.
3.1    It is submitted that in light of the observations made by the High
Court of Andhra Pradesh at Amravati, further investigation of the case is
still continuing on the issue of larger conspiracy for murder and
destruction of evidence at the scene of crime.
3.2    Now      so    far as    the   allegation  of  the   applicants    on
influence/inducement/threat to the witnesses and the false and frivolous
complaints against the officers of the CBI/investigating agency is
concerned, it is submitted that the events unfolded during the course of
investigation do indicate that several witnesses in the case are being
influenced at the behest of the accused D. Siva Shankar Reddy (A5) and
his close associates. It is reported that three star witnesses are already
suspected to have come under the influence of A5 and other
3.3     It is submitted that in the course of investigation, one K.
Gangadhar Reddy, a criminal and a close associate of the accused D.
Siva Shankar Reddy (A5) himself had approached CBI and thereafter his
statement under Section 161 Cr.P.C. was recorded. It is submitted that
he volunteered to give the statement to the learned Magistrate.
Therefore, the investigating officer of CBI, to get his statement recorded
before the learned Court, filed an application and vide order dated
27.11.2021 the learned Court nominated the learned Judicial Magistrate
(First Class), Jamalamudugu to record the statement of K. Gangadhar
Reddy under section 164 Cr.P.C. However, on 29.11.2021, the said K.
Gangadhar Reddy did not attend the court of JMFC, Jamalamudugu to
give his statement under Section 164 Cr.P.C. It is submitted that on the
contrary he gave a statement before the media that he is being
pressurised by the CBI to give statement. It is submitted that thereafter
the said K. Gangadhar Reddy had died under suspicious circumstances
on 9.6.2022 in his house.     It is submitted that one another witness,
namely, J. Shankaraiah was suspended for dereliction of duty in
connection with the incident and whose statement was earlier recorded
under section 161 Cr.P.C. was to appear for recording his statement
under Section 164 Cr.P.C., however, he has been warned over and
initially he did not appear for recording his statement pursuant to the
order dated 30.09.2021. However, thereafter his suspension came to be
revoked on 6.10.2021 and he was reinstated in service and therefore
thereafter he is not appearing for recording his statement under section
3.4   It is submitted that two star witnesses are already under the police
protection, considering the life threat perception to them. Therefore, it is
submitted that there are all possibilities of influencing the witnesses
and/or tampering with the evidence and there shall not be a fair further
investigation on the larger conspiracy as the officers of the
CBI/investigating agency are also pressurised and given threats and
even false FIR is filed against them.
4.    Shri S. Niranjan Reddy, learned Senior Advocate has appeared on
behalf of the State and has opposed the present petition. We have heard
Shri Kapil Sibbal and Shri Guru Krishnakumar, learned Senior
Advocates       appearing       on      behalf     of    the    respective
respondents/impleaders, who are opposing the present writ petition.
The present petition is also opposed by the learned counsel appearing
on behalf of respondent No.4. A counter affidavit is also filed on behalf
of respondent No.4.
4.1   While     opposing     the    present    petition,  learned   senior
counsel/counsel appearing on behalf of the respondents/impleaders
have vehemently submitted that the present petition for the reliefs sought
may not be entertained.
4.2    It is submitted that the primary contentions of the petitioners are in
relation to witnesses being influenced and threat to lives of accused
No.4 – the approver and other witnesses. It is submitted that no real
threat perception to either the life of the accused or to the witnesses has
been established by the petitioners. It is submitted that more than three
years have passed since the murder of the deceased has happened, but
none of the witnesses or accused has approached the police, CBI or
Courts and alleged any threat to life.
4.3    It is submitted that in fact to witnesses, namely, Shaik Dastagiri
and Ranganna have already been granted protection by the Sessions
Court under the Witness Protection Scheme, 2018.
4.4    Relying upon the decision of this Court in the case of Amarinder
Singh v. Parkash Singh Badal, (2009) 6 SCC 260, it is submitted that
as observed and held by this Court, the apprehension of not getting a
fair and impartial enquiry/trial is required to be reasonable and not
4.5    It is submitted that relief of transfer of trial sought in the present
petition has a direct bearing on the right of defence of the accused.
4.6    It is   further   submitted  that    in  the  present   case   the
chargesheet/supplementary chargesheet have been filed. It is submitted
that there are more than 250 witnesses to be examined and therefore if
the trial is transferred to Delhi and/or outside the State of Andhra
Pradesh, it may not only cause undue hardship to those witnesses but in
fact may also prejudice the accused and therefore there may not be
chances of a fair trial.
5.     We have heard learned counsel for the respective parties at
The present petition pertains to the mysterious death of late Y.S.
Vivekananda Reddy, the brother of late Y.S. Rajasekhara Reddy (former
Chief Minister of the united State of Andhra Pradesh) and uncle of Y.S.
Jaganmohan Reddy, the present Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh and
the opposite leader at the time of the incident. The present petitioner
No.1 Dr. Suneetha Narreddy is the daughter of the deceased. She is a
Doctor by profession.      The present petition under Article 32 of the
Constitution of India has been filed by the daughter and wife of the
deceased, seeking transfer of trial arising out of RC-04(S)/2020/CBI/SC-
III/New Delhi from CBI Special Court, Kadapa, Andhra Pradesh to the
CBI Special Court, Hyderabad or CBI Special Court, New Delhi, and also
to direct the CBI for duly completing the investigation in the aforesaid
FIR in a time bound manner.
6.        It is apprehended on behalf of the petitioners that star
witnesses/witnesses are having life threat perceptions and that some of
the witnesses are already influenced. Therefore, it is apprehended that
there is every likelihood that there may not be a fair and impartial trial
and even further investigation on the issue of larger conspiracy for
murder and destruction of evidence at the scene of crime because of the
influence on the part of the accused and the State machinery.
7.     In the case of Abdul Nazar Madani v. State of T.N., (2000) 6
SCC 204, in paragraph 7, it is observed and held as under:
“7. The purpose of the criminal trial is to dispense fair and impartial justice
uninfluenced by extraneous considerations. When it is shown that public
confidence in the fairness of a trial would be seriously undermined, any
party can seek the transfer of a case within the State under Section 407
and anywhere in the country under Section 406 CrPC. The apprehension
of not getting a fair and impartial inquiry or trial is required to be
reasonable and not imaginary, based upon conjectures and surmises. If it
appears that the dispensation of criminal justice is not possible impartially
and objectively and without any bias, before any court or even at any
place, the appropriate court may transfer the case to another court where
it feels that holding of fair and proper trial is conducive. No universal or
hard and fast rules can be prescribed for deciding a transfer petition which
has always to be decided on the basis of the facts of each case.
Convenience of the parties including the witnesses to be produced at the
trial is also a relevant consideration for deciding the transfer petition …..”
7.1    Similar view has been expressed in the case of Jayendra
Saraswathy Swamigal (II) v. State of T.N., (2005) 8 SCC 771.
8.    It is true that as per the settled position of law and even as
observed and held by this Court in the case of Amarinder Singh
(supra) for transfer of a criminal case, there must be a reasonable
apprehension on the part of the party to a case that justice may not be
done. It is also observed in the said decision that it is one of the
principles of administration of justice that justice should not only be done
but it should be seen to be done. As observed by this Court in the
aforesaid decision, however, the Court has to see whether the
apprehension alleged is reasonable or not. The apprehension must not
only be imaginary, but must appear to the court to be a reasonable
9.    Now let us consider whether the apprehension that justice will not
be done and/or there shall not be a fair trial, is reasonable or not.
The deceased was murdered on 14-15/03/2019 in his house. The
then State Government constituted a SIT. Subsequently, petitioner No.2
and Y. Jaganmohan Reddy (the present Chief Minister) filed petitions
before the High Court of Andhra Pradesh for transfer of investigation to
CBI. That thereafter the allegations to the State Assembly were held on
11.04.2019 and the said Y. Jaganmohan Reddy became the Chief
Minister and took oath on 30.05.2019.          Thereafter, the SIT was re-
constituted twice, but there was no progress in the investigation and
therefore petitioner No.2 was constrained to approach the High Court for
transfer of investigation to CBI.       However, in view of the changed
circumstances, Y. Jaganmohan Reddy withdrew his petition to transfer
the investigation to CBI and the State opposed such transfer. However,
the High Court was pleased to transfer the investigation to the CBI and
that is how the CBI took over the investigation. During the course of
investigation, the CBI filed chargesheet/supplementary chargesheet.
However, pursuant to the order passed by the High Court, further
investigation by the CBI on the issue of larger conspiracy of murder and
destruction of evidence at the scheme of crime is still continuing. During
the course of further investigation on the larger conspiracy, an FIR
against the officers of the CBI is filed which has been stayed by the High
Court.    It appears that therefore apprehending harassment and filing
false/frivolous complaints, the CBI/investigating agency stopped further
investigation. Therefore, there is a reasonable apprehension that there
shall not be any fair investigation so far as the further investigation on
larger conspiracy and destruction of evidence is concerned.
10.    Even two key witnesses, namely, Shaik Dastagiri and Ranganna
are already given the police protection under the Witnesses Protection
Scheme, 2018, pursuant to the order passed by the learned Sessions
Court, considering the life threat perception. Even in the response to the
present petition, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the State has
also produced the orders passed by the competent authority granting
police protection to two witnesses.
11.   As observed hereinabove, one of the witnesses who was to record
his statement under Section 164 Cr.P.C. has not appeared for recording
of his statement, though initially he volunteered to given the statement
under Section 164 Cr.P.C. The reason seems to be that thereafter his
suspension order has been revoked and he has been taken back on
12.   From the facts narrated hereinabove, it emerges that one of the
key witnesses, namely, K. Gangadhar Reddy, though initially he
volunteered to give his statement under Section 164 Cr.P.C. and the CBI
submitted an application to record his statement under Section 164
Cr.P.C., thereafter he did not turn up to get his statement recorded and
on the contrary he made a statement before the media that he was
being pressurised by the CBI. That thereafter he has died under
mysterious circumstances.
13.   Considering the aforesaid facts and circumstances, it cannot be
said that apprehension on the part of the petitioners being daughter and
wife of the deceased that there may not be a fair trial and that there may
not be any independent and fair investigation with respect to further
investigation on larger conspiracy and destruction of evidence at the
scene of incident is imaginary and/or has no substance at all.             The
petitioners being daughter and wife of the deceased have a fundamental
right to get justice as victim and they have a legitimate expectation that
criminal trial is being conducted in a fair and impartial manner and
uninfluenced     by    any     extraneous   considerations.      Under      the
circumstances, we are of the opinion that this is a fit case to transfer the
trial and further investigation on larger conspiracy and destruction of
evidence to the State other than the State of Andhra Pradesh.
14.    As per the settled position of law, justice is not to be done but the
justice is seen to have been done also. As per the settled position of
law, free and fair trial is sine qua non of Article 21 of the Constitution. If
the criminal trial is not free and fair and if it is biased, judicial fairness
and the criminal justice system would be at stake, shaking the
confidence of the public in the system. However, at the same time,
looking to the large number of witnesses to be examined during the trial
and no hardship is caused to those witnesses, we are of the opinion that
instead of transferring the trial to New Delhi, it may be transferred to CBI
Special Court at Hyderabad.
15.    In view of the above and for the reasons stated above, the present
writ petition is allowed. The trial arising out of RC-04(S)/2020/CBI/SC-
III/New Delhi from CBI Special Court, Kadapa, Andhra Pradesh is
hereby ordered to be transferred to the CBI Special Court, Hyderabad.
All   the   relevant    papers     including  chargesheet/supplementary
chargesheet are now to be transferred to the CBI Special Court,
Hyderabad.      The CBI is also directed to complete the further
investigation/investigation in the aforesaid FIR on the larger conspiracy
and destruction of evidence, as observed by the High Court earlier, at
the earliest and it goes without saying that it must be done
independently and in an unbiased manner.
