1.      Feeling aggrieved and dissatisfied with the impugned judgment and order
passed by the High Court of Bombay at Goa in Criminal Writ Petition Nos. 466 of 2021,
467 of 2021, 471 of 2021 and 472 of 2021 dated 03.08.2022, by which, the High Court
has dismissed the said writ petitions holding that the period of Parole is to be excluded
from the period of sentence while considering the 14 years to actual imprisonment for
the purpose of premature release, the original writ petitioners have preferred the
2.      That the original petitioners are all convicts undergoing life imprisonment. That
all of them were released on parole under the provisions of Goa Prisons Rules, 2006
(hereinafter referred to as the “Rules, 2006”). That all the original petitioners applied
for premature release under the Rules, 2006. The State Sentence Revenue Board
recommended for premature release. The State Government sought opinion of the
convicting Court on the premature release of the petitioners. The convicting Court
opined that the convicts shall not be released prematurely considering the gravity of
offence. Therefore, the State Government rejected the premature release of the
petitioners. The convicts – original writ petitioners, therefore, preferred the respective
writ petitions before the High Court of Bombay challenging the State’s decision to not
considering their case for premature release. Before the High Court, it was the case
on behalf of the original writ petitioners that the convicts have completed 14 years in
custody and therefore, as such were entitled for premature release. It was the case
on behalf of the convicts- original petitioners that the period of parole is not to be
excluded from the period of sentence under the Rules, 2006 while considering 14
years of actual imprisonment for the purpose of premature release. Taking into
consideration the Rule 335 of the Rules, 2006 which provides that the period of
release on Furlough and Parole “shall be counted as remission of sentence ….” the
High Court by impugned judgment and order has observed and held that the period
of parole is to be excluded from the period of sentence while considering 14 years of
actual imprisonment for the purpose of premature release. As the respective convicts
– original writ petitioners excluding period of parole did not complete 14 years of actual
imprisonment, the High Court by the impugned judgment and order has dismissed the
respective writ petitions. Feeling aggrieved and dissatisfied with the impugned
common judgment and order passed by the High Court, the original writ petitioners
have preferred the present petitions.
3.     Shri Siddharth Dave, learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of the
respective petitioners has vehemently submitted that in the facts and circumstances
of the case the Hon’ble High Court has seriously erred in holding that the period of
parole is to be excluded from the period of sentence under the Rules, 2006 while
considering 14 years of actual imprisonment for the purpose of premature release.
3.1.   It is vehemently submitted by Shri Dave learned Senior Counsel for the
respective petitioners that the Hon’ble High Court has erred in relying on the Rule 335
of the Rules, 2006 to hold that since period of release on parole is counted as
remission, the same cannot be counted as part of sentence.
3.2. It is submitted that even while on parole the accused /convicts can be said to
be in custody / judicial custody and therefore, period of parole is to be included while
considering 14 years of actual imprisonment for the purpose of premature release.
3.3. It is vehemently submitted that as such the view taken by the High Court is just
contrary to the decision of this Court in the case of Sunil Fulchand Shah vs. Union
of India reported in (2000) 3 SCC 409 as well as in the case of Avtar Singh vs. State
of Haryana reported in (2002) 3 SCC 409 (para 11).
3.4. It is further submitted by Shri Dave learned senior counsel for the original writ
petitioners-convicts that even as per Section 55 of the Prisons Act, 1894, a prisoner
when being taken to or from any prison in which he may be lawfully confined, shall be
deemed to be in prison and therefore, deemed to be in custody and therefore, the
period of parole shall have to be included as in custody for the purpose of actual period
of imprisonment while considering 14 years of actual imprisonment.
Making above submissions, it is prayed to hold that the period of parole is to be
included while considering 14 years of actual imprisonment for the purpose of
premature release.
4.     The short question which is posed for the consideration of this Court is whether
the period of parole is to be excluded from the period of sentence under the Rules,
2006 while considering 14 years of actual imprisonment for the purpose of premature
5.     While considering the aforesaid question /issue, the object and purpose of
parole is required to be taken into consideration.
Parole is a conditional release. Parole can be granted in case of short-term
imprisonment. Duration of parole extends to one month. Parole is granted by the State
Government. For parole, specific reason is required. Parole can be granted for number
of times.
6.     “Imprisonment” is defined under Rule 2(21) of the Rules, 2006. “Imprisonment”
means imprisonment of either description as defined in Section 53 of the Indian Penal
Code, 1860 and the General Clauses Act, 1897. The term of imprisonment is not
included in the computation of term of parole.
7.     Keeping in mind the above, the issue involved in the present case viz. whether
the period of parole is to be excluded from the period of sentence while considering
14 years of actual imprisonment for the purpose of premature release is to be
7.1.   The High Court while passing the impugned judgment and order and taking the
view that the period of parole is to be excluded from the period of sentence while
considering 14 years of actual imprisonment has heavily relied upon or considered
Rule 335 of the Rules, 2006 which provides that the period of release on Furlough
and Parole “shall be counted as remission of sentence ….”. Once the period of parole
is to be counted as remission of sentence, as rightly observed and held by the High
Court, the period of parole is also required to be excluded from the period of sentence
while considering 14 years of actual imprisonment.
8.     Now, so far as the reliance placed upon the decision of this Court in the case of
Sunil Fulchand Shah (supra) relied upon by learned senior counsel for the respective
petitioners – convicts / prisoners is concerned, the said decision shall not be
applicable to the facts of the case on hand. It was a case of detenue under the
provisions of the COFEPOSA Act. Even in the said decision, it is observed and held
that the period of detention would not stand automatically extended by any period of
parole granted to the detenu unless the order of parole or rules or instructions
specifically indicates as a term and condition of parole, to the contrary. In the present
case the term ‘imprisonment’ is not included in the computation of term of parole. Rule
335 specifically provides that parole is to be counted as remission of sentence.
Therefore, the said decision would not be applicable to the facts of the case on hand.
8.1.   Similarly, the decision of this case in the case of Avtar Singh (supra) also shall
not be applicable to the facts of the case on hand while considering the issue viz.
whether the period of parole is to be excluded from the period of sentence under the
Rules, 2006 while considering 14 years of actual imprisonment.
9.     Now, so far as the submission on behalf of the petitioners relying upon Section
55 of the Prisons Act, 1894 that even on parole the prisoners shall be deemed to be
in custody and therefore, the said period is to be included for the purpose of actual
imprisonment is concerned, the aforesaid has no substance. Section 55 of the Prisons
Act, 1894 shall not be applicable with respect to release on parole. Section 55 of the
Prisons Act, 1894 shall be applicable in a case where a prisoner is taken out from any
prison, he shall deem to have been in prison. However, the same shall not be
applicable with respect to release on parole.
10.    If the submission on behalf of the prisoners that the period of parole is to be
included while considering 14 years of actual imprisonment is accepted, in that case,
any prisoner who may be influential may get the parole for number of times as there
is no restrictions and it can be granted number of times and if the submission on behalf
of the prisoners is accepted, it may defeat the very object and purpose of actual
imprisonment. We are of the firm view that for the purpose of considering actual
imprisonment, the period of parole is to be excluded. We are in complete agreement
with the view taken by the High Court holding so.
11.    In view of the above and for the reasons stated above, all these Special Leave
Petitions deserve to be dismissed and are accordingly dismissed.
