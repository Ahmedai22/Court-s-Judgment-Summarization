This appeal is filed by the original petitioner to challenge the
judgment of the learned Single Judge dated 10.12.2021.                       The
appellant was engaged as a constable-driver in CRPF.                     He was
granted leave from 21.08.2013 to 19.09.2013.                    He however did
not report for duty on completion of leave period.                  He remained
unauthorisedly absent without sanction of leave from 20.09.2013
on   wards   without    any    intimation         to     the  department.    The
departmental enquiry was therefore initiated against him. He did
not participate in the enquiry.           Final order was passed by the
(2 of 4)               [SAW-333/2022]
disciplinary authority on 10.09.2014 imposing punishment of
dismissal. During the enquiry it appears that the department had
discharged the charge-sheet, list of witnesses, enquiry officer’s
report at all stages but there was no response from the petitioner.
The petitioner had challenged the order of the disciplinary
authority. The appellate authority converted the order of dismissal
to removal from service. Eventually the petitioner approached this
Court and challenged the punishment imposed on him. His petition
was dismissed by the learned Single Judge upon which this appeal
has been filed.
Appearing for the appellant-original petitioner it is submitted
that looking to the long clean service of the petitioner extreme
punishment of removal from service should not have been
imposed. He submitted that the petitioner was suffering from
illness on account of which he could not resume his duties.                 He
lastly  contended    that    none       of    the      communications  of  the
department reached to him because the petitioner was not living
at his residence. In support of his contentions he relied on
following decisions:-
(1) In case of Veerendra Kumar Dubey Vs. Chief of Army
Staff and Ors., reported in (2016) 2 Supreme Court Cases
(2) In case of Roop Singh Negi Vs. Punjab National Bank
and Ors., reported in (2009) 2 Supreme Court Cases 570;
(3) In case of Krushnakant B. Parmar Vs. Union of India
and Anr., reported in (2012) 3 Supreme Court Cases 178;
(4) In case of Bhagwan Lal Arya Vs. Commissioner of
Police, Delhi and Ors., reported in 2004 (3) SLR 70;
(3 of 4)                [SAW-333/2022]
(5) In case of Chairman-cum-Managing Director, Coal
India Limited and Another. Vs. Mukul Kumar Choudhuri and
Others., reported in (2009) 15 Supreme Court Cases 620.
In our view the petitioner has not made out any case for
interference. We may recall, the petitioner was engaged as
constable of CRPF which is a disciplined force. He remained
unauthorisedly absent without sanctioned leave or communication
to the department for about one year.                  This was a clear case of
misconduct.   Section 10 of the Central Reserve Police Force Act,
1949 (in short ‘the Act’) pertains to less heinous offences and
includes the act of a member of the force of remaining absent
himself without leave, or without sufficient cause overstaying the
leave granted to him. For any such less heinous offences the
punishment prescribed under Section 10 of the said Act is of
imprisonment for a term which may extend to one year or with
fine which may extend to three months’ pay, or with both. Section
11 pertains to minor punishments. Sub-section (1) of Section 11
provides that the commandant or any other authority or officer as
may be prescribed, may, subject to any rules made under the Act,
award in lieu of, or in addition to, suspension or dismissal any one
or more of the punishments to any member of the force whom he
considers to be guilty of disobedience, neglect of duty, or
remissness in the discharge of the duty or any duty or other
misconduct in his capacity as a member of the force. One of the
punishments prescribed is removal from the office.
Thus for the act of remaining absent without leave, under
Section 10 the competent authority could impose a punishment of
imprisonment. Under Section 11 the punishment of dismissal or
(4 of 4)                   [SAW-333/2022]
removal from service can also be considered.                     As noted, the
disciplinary authority had imposed the punishment of dismissal
from service which was converted by the appellate authority to
removal from service. These punishments are thus within the
competence of the said authority to impose. The misconduct of
not reporting for duty for over one year without sanctioned leave
was established during the course of enquiry. The petitioner has
not produced any evidence of his suffering from such illness which
prevented him from resuming his duty and which prevented him
from appearing in the departmental enquiry and any rate from
communicating to the department his inability to appear. All
communications were made by the department at his residential
address. Despite which the petitioner did not appear before the
disciplinary authority. The petitioner cannot complain that the
enquiry was conducted ex-parte.
Under the circumstances, we do not find any reason to
interfere. The case of punishment essentially rests with the
disciplinary authority. The Court would not interfere unless the
punishment shocks the conscience of the Court. Reference in this
respect can be made to the decision of the Supreme Court in the
case of B.C. Chaturvedi Vs. Union of India and Ors., reported
in AIR 1996 SC 484.
