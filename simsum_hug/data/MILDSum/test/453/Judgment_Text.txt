The present Application is filed under the Section 7 of the Insolvency
and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 (for brevity ‘IBC, 2016’) read with Rule 4 of
the Insolvency and Bankruptcy (Application to Adjudicating Authority)
Rules, 2016 by M/s. Dalmia Group Holdings through Authorized
Representative of the Proprietor, Mr. Inder Preet Singh (for brevity
‘Applicant/Financial Creditor’), with a prayer to initiate the Corporate
Insolvency process against M/s. Ansal Properties and Infrastructure
Limited (for brevity ‘Corporate Debtor’).
2.      The Corporate Debtor namely, M/s. Ansal Properties and
Infrastructure Limited is a Company incorporated on 30.06.1967, under
the provisions of the erstwhile Companies Act, 1956 with CIN
L45101DL1967PLC004759, having its registered office at 115, Ansal
Bhawan, 16, Kasturba Gandhi Marg, New Dellii-110001, which is within
the jurisdiction of this Tribunal.
3.      The Authorized Share Capital of the Corporate Debtor Company
is Rs.1,50,00,00,000/- and Paid-up Share Capital of the Company is
Rs.78,70,24,380/- as per the master data annexed with the Application.
4.      That the detailed particulars of the Financial Debt including the
total amount of debt in default and the date of default as mentioned in
the Part IV of the application are reproduced below for the convenience :
5.      That from perusal of the Part IV of the Application, it is observed
that the Applicant has claimed the dues of Rs. 04,88,20,618/- as on
30.09.2021, out of which Rs 01,40,00,000/- has been claimed as the
Principal Amount. The Applicant has mentioned the 28.10.2015 as the
date of default in its application. That in order to cross the hurdle of
limitation, the Applicant has filed Annual Reports of the Corporate Debtor
for the Financial Years 2017-18 to 2019-20 along with its application.
6.      That vide order dated 24.05.2022, this Bench has observed that
the present Application has been preferred in the name of the
Proprietorship firm, accordingly, the defect being curable, the Applicant
was directed to rectify the memo of parties within seven days. That in
compliance of the direction, the Applicant filed the amended memo of
parties on 26.05.2022 rectifying the cause title of the case. The same is
taken on record.
7.      That during the course of hearing on 24.04.2022, the arguments
were heard on merits and the order was reserved. Subsequent to
reserving of the order, one IA No.2283/2022 was filed by the Corporate
Debtor stating that an amount of Rs. 04,90,00,000/- has been
transferred in the account of the Financial Creditor on 16.05.2022.
8.      That vide order dated 18.05.2022, this Adjudicating Authority
had directed the Financial Creditor to confirm whether any amount has
been received by it. Accordingly, the matter was posted for 26.05.2022.
9.       The Financial Creditor, in response to the same, has filed its reply
in IA-2283 of 2022 and has confirmed that it has received an amount of
Rs. 04,90,00,000/- in its accounts. However, it has stated that it is not
the full amount, which was required to be paid by the Corporate Debtor.
10.      That the scanned copy of the relevant averments made by the
Financial Creditor are reproduced below :
11.     That the Financial Creditor has also annexed the Calculation
sheet stating that still there is a balance amount of Rs. 65,83,033/-
outstanding towards the principal dues. The scanned copy of the
Calculation Sheet filed by the Financial Creditor is reproduced below :
12.     That during the course of hearing on 26.05.2022 in IA-2283 of
2022, Ld. Sr. Counsel appearing for the Financial Creditor further
submitted that there is still the principal amount due and payable by the
Corporate Debtor and hence, it insisted on initiation of the CIRP.
13.     It was further stated by the Ld. Sr. Counsel appearing for the
Financial Creditor that there was no settlement between the parties and
the aforesaid amount has been deposited by the Corporate Debtor,
without any prior consent of the Financial Creditor.
14.      Per Contra, Ld. Counsel for the Corporate Debtor stated that the
entire amount claimed in the Part IV of the Application has been
discharged including the principal amount. He further argued that the
said amount has not been returned by the Applicant at any stage. He
further placed reliance on the Judgement of this Bench passed in the
matter of Saraf Chits Private Limited Vs. KAD Housing Private
Limited in (IB)-255(ND)/2021, dated 23.05.2022 stating that in the
light of discharge of the entire Principal amount claimed in part IV of the
Application, the CIR process cannot be initiated against the corporate
debtor.
15.      That after hearing submissions of both the parties, this Bench
observes that the Corporate Debtor had transferred an amount of
Rs.04,90,00,000/- in the Financial Creditor’s Account and the said fact
is duly admitted by the Financial Creditor. Although it is contended by
the Financial Creditor that the Corporate Debtor had deposited the
money without its prior permission. However, since the amount has not
been returned by the Financial Creditor, we shall consider this issue
while adjudicating the debt and default.
16.      That from the pleadings, it is observed that pursuant to the
deposit of Rs. 04,90,00,000/- by the Corporate Debtor in the accounts of
Financial Creditor, both the parties are adjusting the said amount in their
own manner. That the Financial Creditor has adjusted the amount of
Rs.04,90,00,000/- in the interest portion calculated till 24.05.2022 and
has reached to a conclusion that Rs.65,83,033/- has been outstanding
as the Principal Amount. Per Contra, the Corporate Debtor has stated
that the payment of Rs 04,90,00,000/- has resulted in complete
discharge of the full Principal amount of Rs.01,40,00,000/- as well as the
interest as claimed by the applicant in the Part IV of its Application.
17.     Here, for the sake of convenience, we again refer to the relevant
extracts of Part IV of the Application depicting the amount claimed, the
scanned copy of which is reproduced below :
From the perusal of the aforesaid relevant extracts of Part IV of the
Application, it is observed that the Financial Creditor had claimed the
total  dues    Rs.04,88,20,618/-           as    on 30.09.2021, out of   which
Rs.01,40,00,000/- is the principal amount and the rest is interest portion
calculated as on 30.09.2021.
18.      From the above, it can be inferred that the Corporate Debt has
computed its debt as on 30.09.2021, which became due and payable on
28.10.2015, as per the date of default mentioned in Part IV of the
19.      That the aforesaid facts depict that the Applicant has also claimed
interest portion falling within the Section 10A period, i.e the suspended
period of IBC commencing from 25.03.2020 to 24.03.2021, for which no
CIRP can ever be initiated.
20.      That before deposit of Rs.04,90,00,000/- by the Corporate
Debtor, the said fact was not relevant, since the Principal Outstanding
claimed in the Part IV of the Application was above Rs 1 Crore, which was
due and payable much prior to the Suspension period of IBC as
stipulated under Section 10A of IBC, 2016.
21.      It is observed that the Applicant had claimed the unpaid financial
debt of Rs.04,88,20,618/- as the total outstanding amount in Part IV of
the Application. Even if we ignore, for a moment, that the Financial
Creditor had claimed interest for the 10A period, then also it is amply
clear   that    the  Financial       Creditor     had     received an amount       of
Rs.04,90,00,000/-, which is more than the total amount (Principal +
Interest) of Rs.04,88,20,618/- claimed in Part IV of the Application.
Therefore, in our considered view, the Applicant cannot claim any
amount beyond what is stated/claimed in the Part IV of its Application,
since it is a trite law that the IBC proceedings are not recovery
proceedings.
22.      Further, it is observed that the Financial Creditor has erroneously
calculated the unpaid Principal outstanding amount of Rs.65,83,033/-
after adjusting the amount payable during the 10A period and the
interest for the period beyond filing of the present Application under
Section 7 of IBC, 2016. In our considered view, such a calculation cannot
be accepted for arriving at the unpaid debt for triggering the CIR process
of the Corporate Debtor.
23.      In view of the above discussion, the Application is Dismissed
and the IA-2283 of 2022 is disposed of.
24.      However, we take note of the conduct of the Corporate Debtor that
not only it had made all possible efforts to delay the matter, but also it
had deposited the amount behind the back of the Financial Creditor and
without its consent and that too, when the order was reserved. Therefore,
we impose a cost of Rs.1,00,000/- (One Lakh) only on the Corporate
Debtor, which shall be deposited in the Prime Minister’s Relief Fund
within 15 days, receipt of which shall be filed before this Bench before
