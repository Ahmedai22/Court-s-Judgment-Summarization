The Supreme Court commuted death sentence of a murder accused taking into account his illegal solitary confinement for about ten years.
BA Umesh alias Umesh Reddy, an ex-cop, was sentenced to death in a rape and murder case by a Sessions Court in Bengaluru upon being convicted in the year 2006. He was found guilty of rape and murder of a house wife. Later, the Supreme Court upheld the death sentence awarded to him in year 2011. The mercy petition was rejected by the President of India and challenging the same he approached the Karnataka High Court. As the writ petition filed by him got dismissed, he approached the Apex Court.
Before the Apex Court, it was contended that from 2006 till 2016, he was kept in solitary confinement in "Andheri Block" in violation of the judgment in Sunil Batra vs. Delhi Administration & Ors (1978) 4 SCC 494. He also relied on the decision in Ajay Kumar Pal vs Union of India 2015 (2) SCC 478 in which segregation of the concerned petitioner, from the day he was awarded death sentence till his mercy petition was disposed of, was taken to be in violation of the law laid down by this Court in Sunil Batra and the death sentence was commuted.
Taking note of this contention and other relevant records produced before it, the court observed:
"Having considered the entirety of matter, in our view, the impact of solitary confinement were obviously evident in the instant case, as would be clear from the letter given by the medical professional on 6.11.2011 and the communication emanating from the jail on 8.11.2011. The incarceration in solitary confinement thus did show ill effects on the well-being of the appellant. In the backdrop of these features of the matter, in our view, the appellant is entitled to have the death sentence imposed upon him to be commuted to death sentence to life.
The court thus commuted the death sentence to sentence of life imprisonment with a rider that he shall undergo minimum sentence of 30 years.
"If any application for remission is moved on his behalf, the same shall be considered on its own merits only after he has undergone actual sentence of 30 years. If no remission is granted, it goes without saying that as laid down by this Court in Gopal Vinayak Godse vs. State of Maharashtra, the sentence of imprisonment for life shall mean till the remainder of his life", the court added.
