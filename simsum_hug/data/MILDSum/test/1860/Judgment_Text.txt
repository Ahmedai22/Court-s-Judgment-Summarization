By means of this writ petition filed under Article 226 of the
Constitution of India ostensibly in Public Interest, a prayer has
been made to issue direction to the State Government to
enhance the age of superannuation of the employees of the State
of U.P. from 60 years to 62 years.
It is strange that such a petition has been filed purportedly in
public interest. The petitioner is a complete stranger so far as
the conditions of service of the employees of the State
Government are concerned. It is also noticeable that the Hon'ble
Supreme Court in more than one cases has categorically held
that in service matters, no public interest litigation will be
maintainable. Reference may be had to the judgment in the case
of Dr. Duryodhan Sahu and others versus Jitendra Kumar
Mishra and others, reported in (1998) 7 SCC 273.
In the case of Dattaraj Nathuji Thaware vs. State of
Maharashtra and others, reported in (2005) 1 SCC 590,
Hon'ble Supreme Court referring to the judgment in the case of
Dr. Duryodhan Sahu and others (supra) has observed that
despite the said judgment the inflow of so called PILs involving
service matters continues unabated in the courts. The relevant
observation in this regard has been made by Hon'ble Supreme
Court in para 16 of the judgment in the case of Dattaraj
Nathuji Thaware (supra), which is extracted herein below:
"16. As noted supra, a time has come to weed out the petitions, which
though titled as public interest litigations are in essence something else.
It is shocking to note that courts are flooded with a large number of so-
called public interest litigations where even a minuscule percentage can
legitimately be called as public interest litigations. Though the
parameters of public interest litigation have been indicated by this Court
in a large number of cases, yet unmindful of the real intentions and
objectives, courts are entertaining such petitions and wasting valuable
judicial time which, as noted above, could be otherwise utilised for
disposal of genuine cases. Though in Duryodhan Sahu (Dr.) v. Jitendra
SC 114] this Court held that in service matters PILs should not be
entertained, the inflow of so-called PILs involving service matters
continues unabated in the courts and strangely are entertained. The
least the High Courts could do is to throw them out on the basis of the
said decision. The other interesting aspect is that in the PILs, official
documents are being annexed without even indicating as to how the
petitioner came to possess them. In one case, it was noticed that an
interesting answer was given as to its possession. It was stated that a
packet was lying on the road and when out of curiosity the petitioner
opened it, he found copies of the official documents. Apart from the
sinister manner, if any, of getting such copies, the real brain or force
behind such cases would get exposed to find out the truth and motive
behind the petition. Whenever such frivolous pleas, as noted, are taken
to explain possession, the court should do well not only to dismiss the
petitions but also to impose exemplary costs. It would be desirable for
the courts to filter out the frivolous petitions and dismiss them with costs
as aforestated so that the message goes in the right direction that
petitions filed with oblique motive do not have the approval of the
When we closely examine the averments made in the writ
petition, what we find is that the petitioner is a complete
stranger and has in fact sought alteration in the conditions of
service of the employees of the State Government, hence we are
not inclined to entertain the instant writ petition.
In view of the aforesaid, the writ petition is dismissed.
