learned Judge, Family Court No.2, Bikaner in Criminal Misc. Case
No.18/2016 (268/2015), whereby the learned court below has
allowed the application under Section 125 Cr.P.C. preferred by the
wife, while awarding a monthly maintenance to the wife and son,
to the tune of Rs.50,000/- and Rs.20,000/- (totalling Rs.70,000/-)
respectively, and thus, the husband sought quashing and setting
aside of the said order. The petitioner-wife (respondent herein in
Petition No.1095/2018) has preferred S.B. Criminal Revision
Petition  No.1345/2018,        challenging           the     same  order    dated
30.08.2018, while making prayer only to the extent that the
amount of monthly maintenance, as already awarded by the
learned court below, be enhanced to Rs.2,50,000/- (for wife) and
Rs.1,30,000/- (for son).
2.    Mr. Shadan Farasat assisted by Mr. Harshit Bhurani, learned
counsel, who appeared on behalf of the husband submitted that
the marriage in this case was solemnized on 27.05.2010 at
Bikaner; thereafter, the couple went to reside in United States of
America (USA). Learned counsel further submitted that out of the
said wedlock, Master Anay (son) was born on 21.05.2011.
2.1   Learned counsel further submitted that however, on count of
the alleged disharmony in their (husband and wife) matrimonial
relationship, the wife left her matrimonial home at USA on
13.11.2013 and came back to India alongwith the son. Learned
counsel also submitted that thereafter, on 19.06.2015, the wife
filed an application against the husband under Section 125 Cr.P.C.
before the learned court below, which was allowed vide the
impugned order dated 30.08.2018, while awarding the monthly
(3 of 6)                   [CRLR-1345/2018]
maintenance to the wife and the son (who is in custody of the
wife), as mentioned above.
2.2. Learned counsel further submitted that it is an admitted
position that the wife is earning Rs.85,000/- per month and
staying at Hyderabad, and thus, competent to earn her own
livelihood, while the husband does not oppose the maintenance
granted to the son vide the impugned order. Learned counsel also
submitted that the wife deserted the husband of her own sweet
and free will, and thus, she is not entitled for any kind of
2.3    Learned counsel relied upon the order dated 16.09.2019
passed by the Hon’ble Supreme Court in Kusum Bhatia Vs.
Sagar       Sethi      (Special           Leave             to   Appeal        (C)
No(s).16051/2017. Learned counsel further relied upon the
judgment rendered by the Hon’ble Supreme Court in Deb
303, and the judgment rendered by the Hon’ble High Court of
Delhi in K.N. Vs. R.G., 2019 SCC Online Del 7704.
3.     On the other hand, Mr. Parvej Moyal, learned counsel for the
wife submitted that the husband is taking the plea of desertion by
the wife, merely to deny maintenance to her, as awarded by the
learned court below, whereas, he himself had sought divorce in
the Court at USA and the same was ex parte done in favour of the
husband on 29.04.2015, while passing the necessary decree.
3.1    Learned counsel further submitted that there is no factual
dispute to the extent that the wife is earning Rs.85,000/- and
husband     is  earning     about       15000         US$,     which   comes     to
Rs.11,62,000/- (INR per month).
(4 of 6)               [CRLR-1345/2018]
3.2  Learned counsel also submitted that in accordance with the
precedent law laid down by the Hon’ble Supreme Court in
Rajnesh Vs. Neha & Anr., AIR 2021 SC 569, even if the wife is
earning, then also she is entitled for the determination of
maintenance, in accordance with the lifestyle of her husband in
the matrimonial home.
Relevant portion of the judgment rendered in Rajnesh Vs. Neha
& Anr. (supra), reads as under:
The Courts have held that if the wife is earning, it
cannot operate as a bar from being awarded maintenance
by the husband. The Courts have provided guidance on this
issue in the following judgments.
In Shailja & Anr. v Khobbanna, this Court held that
merely because the wife is capable of earning, it would not
be a sufficient ground to reduce the maintenance awarded
by the Family Court. The Court has to determine whether
the income of the wife is sufficient to enable her to
maintain herself, in accordance with the lifestyle of her
husband in the matrimonial home. Sustenance does not
mean, and cannot be allowed to mean mere survival.
In Sunita Kachwaha & Ors. v Anil Kachwaha the wife
had a postgraduate degree, and was employed as a
teacher in Jabalpur. The husband raised a contention that
since the wife had sufficient income, she would not require
financial assistance from the husband. The Supreme Court
repelled this contention, and held that merely because the
wife was earning some income, it could not be a ground to
reject her claim for maintenance.
The Bombay High Court in Sanjay Damodar Kale v
Kalyani Sanjay Kale while relying upon the judgment in
Sunita Kachwaha (supra), held that neither the mere
potential to earn, nor the actual earning of the wife,
howsoever meagre, is sufficient to deny the claim of
maintenance.
(5 of 6)                  [CRLR-1345/2018]
An able-bodied husband must be presumed to be
capable of earning sufficient money to maintain his wife
and children, and cannot contend that he is not in a
position to earn sufficiently to maintain his family, as held
by the Delhi High Court in Chander Prakash Bodhraj v Shila
Rani Chander Prakash. The onus is on the husband to
establish with necessary material that there are sufficient
grounds to show that he is unable to maintain the family,
and discharge his legal obligations for reasons beyond his
control. If the husband does not disclose the exact amount
of his income, an adverse inference may be drawn by the
This Court in Shamima Farooqui v Shahid Khan cited
the judgment in Chander Prakash (supra) with approval,
and held that the obligation of the husband to provide
maintenance stands on a higher pedestal than the wife.
3.3    Learned counsel thus submitted that the sustenance does
not mean and cannot be allowed to mean a mere survival, and the
lifestyle at Hyderabad, where the wife alongwith her son is
presently residing, is very costly, and the son is also going in a
good and reputed school at Hyderabad, the expenditure whereof is
also too high. Learned counsel thus submitted that even if the wife
is earning something, then also she is entitled to claim the
necessary and adequate maintenance from her husband.
4.     After hearing learned counsel for the parties as well as
perusing the record of the case along with the precedent laws
cited at the Bar, this Court holds that merely the fact that the wife
is earning would not dis-entitle her from the maintenance. The
husband himself has taken the divorce on 29.04.2015, fact not in
dispute, and therefore, the charge of desertion cannot become a
ground so as to enable the husband to disqualify the wife from
(6 of 6)                   [CRLR-1345/2018]
claiming the amount of monthly maintenance, in any manner
whatsoever.
5.     The learned trial court, vide the impugned order, has rightly
arrived at a considered decision and looking to the cost of living at
Hyderabad and the fact that both the husband and wife were
maintaining a very good lifestyle in USA, which is clearly apparent
on the face of the record, it would be appropriate to dispose the
present     petitions,    while    enhancing           the     amount    of  monthly
maintenance payable by the husband to the wife and son.
6.     This   Court    finds     that     the      husband        is earning    about
Rs.12,00,000/- per month and the wife is earning Rs.85,000/- per
month, and therefore, a very reasonable capacity of the husband
to pay the maintenance should be 1/12th of his income, which
shall take care of the husband’s claim for high cost of living in
7.     In view of the above, the amount of monthly maintenance as
awarded by the learned court below, vide the impugned order
dated 30.08.2018, to the wife and the son, is enhanced to
Rs.75000/- (for wife) and Rs. 25000/- (for son). The impugned
order dated 30.08.2018 stands modified accordingly.
8.     In light of the observations made hereinabove and the
modification in the impugned order passed by the learned court
below, the present petitions stand disposed of. All pending
applications also stand disposed of.
