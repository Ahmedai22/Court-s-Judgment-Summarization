Challenging the order and decree, dated 30.06.2010, passed in
M.V.O.P.No.532 of 2008 on the file of the Chairman, Motor
Accidents Claims Tribunal-cum-Principal District Judge, Medak at
Sangareddy (for short “the Tribunal”), the claimants filed the
present appeal.
The claimants, who are the husband and children of one
V.Pushpa (hereinafter referred to as “the deceased”), filed a petition
under Section 166 of the Motor Vehicles Act claiming compensation
of Rs.4,50,000/- for the death of the deceased, who died in a motor
vehicle accident that occurred on 21.05.2006. It is stated that on that
day the deceased, along with others, was traveling in Innova Car
bearing No.AP 29 H-4329 from Shirdi, Tuljapur to Hyderabd and
when the said vehicle reached near Nirna Cross Roads on N.H.No.9,
the driver of the said vehicle drove it in a rash and negligent manner
with high speed and dashed to a Bus-stand building, due to which
the inmates of the vehicle including the deceased sustained grievous
injuries. Basing on the complaint, a case in Crime No.67 of 2006 has
been registered against the driver of the Car. Immediately after the
accident, the deceased was shifted to Government Hospital,
Mannaekkali and she died while shifting to Gandhi Hospital,
Secunderabad. It is further stated that the deceased was aged about
41 years and was earning Rs.4,500/- per month as maid servant.
Hence, the claimants filed claim-petition against the respondents 1
and 2, being the owner and insurer of the said Car.
Before the Tribunal, the 1st respondent remained ex parte and
the 2nd respondent filed counter denying the manner in which the
accident took place, age, avocation and earnings of the deceased and
the relationship of the claimants with the deceased. It is also denied
by the 2nd respondent that the vehicle involved in the accident was
insured with the 2nd respondent and the person, who drove the
vehicle, was having valid and subsisting driving licence to drive
such vehicle and the vehicle was roadworthy to ply.       It is further
contended that the claimants are not entitled to claim interest on
non-pecuniary damages and also the interest claimed is highly
excessive.    In the additional counter, it is stated by the 2nd
respondent that as per the police record, the crime vehicle was used
for hire purpose at the time of accident and the policy was issued for
private use, as such, the 1st respondent has violated the terms and
conditions of the policy and, therefore, the 1st respondent alone is
liable to pay the compensation and the 2nd respondent has no
liability to pay any compensation and the petition is liable to be
dismissed against the 2nd respondent.
Basing on the above pleadings, the Tribunal framed the
1) Whether the accident occurred due to the rash and
negligent driving of the driver of the crime vehicle?
2) Whether the petitioners are entitled for compensation, if so,
On behalf of the claimant, P.Ws.1 and 2 were examined and
got marked Exs.A1 to A5. On behalf of the respondents, R.W.1 was
examined and Exs.B1 to B4 were marked.
After analyzing the evidence available on record, the Tribunal
while awarding compensation of Rs.2,80,000/- with proportionate
costs and interest @ 7.5% per annum from the date of petition till
realization, held that since the deceased had traveled in a hired
vehicle, it is against the terms and conditions of the insurance policy
and, therefore, the Insurance Company is not liable to pay
compensation and it is the 1st respondent, the owner of the Car,
alone is liable to pay the compensation.          Challenging the said
finding and also not being satisfied with the quantum of
compensation awarded by the Tribunal, the present appeal is filed
by the claimants.
Heard the learned Counsel appearing on either side and
perused the record.
Learned Counsel for the appellants/claimants submitted that
the Tribunal dismissed the claim against the 2nd respondent on the
ground that the 1st respondent has violated the terms and conditions
of the insurance policy by using the crime vehicle for hire purpose.
He further submitted that in case of violation of policy conditions
including driver of the offending vehicle not having valid driving
licence at the time of accident, gratuitous passenger etc., still the
Insurer has to pay the compensation to the claimants at the first
place and shall recover the same from the owner of the vehicle later.
In support of his contention, he relied upon the judgment of the
Apex Court in Manuara Khatun and others v. Rajesh Kumar and
others1. Insofar as the enhancement of compensation is concerned,
learned Counsel for the appellants/claimants would submit that as
per the principles laid down by the Apex Court in the recent
decisions, the income of the housewife is to be taken at Rs.3,000/-
per month and the claimants are also entitled to future prospects. It
is also submitted that the Tribunal did not award any amount under
conventional       heads.  Therefore,  he  prayed   to   enhance   the
compensation awarded by the Tribunal.
On the other hand, the learned Standing Counsel for the
Insurance Company submitted that with regard to the quantum of
compensation,        the  Tribunal    has  adequately    granted   the
compensation and the same needs no interference by this Court.
Insofar as the liability is concerned, he submits that the vehicle was
used for hire purpose and the deceased was traveling in the vehicle
as gratuitous passenger and, therefore, the Tribunal has rightly
dismissed the claim against the 2nd respondent and the said order
does not require any interference.
On considering the arguments advanced by both the learned
Counsel, the issues that arise for consideration in this appeal are as
1. Whether the claimants are entitled for enhancement of
2. Whether the vehicle was used for hire purpose and
deceased, who was traveling in the vehicle, comes
under the purview of gratuitous passenger and if the
deceased comes under the purview of gratuitous
passenger, pay and recovery can be ordered against the
Admittedly, the claimants filed a claim-petition under Section
166 of the Motor Vehicles Act, and the rash and negligent act on the
part of the driver of the Innova Car No.AP 29 H 4329 was proved. A
perusal of the judgment of the Tribunal would show that after
considering the age and avocation of the deceased, the Tribunal has
rightly awarded an amount of Rs.2,80,000/- under the head of loss
of income, which needs no interference.        However, in National
Insurance Company Limited Vs. Pranay Sethi and others2, the Apex
Court held that “the reasonable figures on conventional heads,
namely, loss of estate, loss of consortium and funeral expenses
should be Rs.15,000/-, Rs. 40,000/- and Rs. 15,000/- respectively”.
A perusal of the impugned order would show that the Tribunal did
not award any amount under conventional heads. In view of the
law laid down by the Apex Court in Pranay Sethi’s case (2 supra), the
claimants are entitled to Rs.70,000/- under conventional heads.
Thus, in all the claimants are entitled to Rs.3,50,000/-.
Insofar as the liability of the 2nd respondent/Insurance
Company is concerned, the Tribunal observed that R.W.1 stated in
his evidence that in Ex.B4-161 Cr.P.C. statement, the witness,
Krishna Reddy, stated that they hired the Innova Vehicle and
traveled in it. In Rajendra Singh v. State of U.P. and another3, the
Apex Court held that “the statements under Section 161 Cr.P.C.
being wholly inadmissible in evidence, could not at all be taken into
consideration.”        Relying upon the said judgment, in N.Rama
Krishna Reddy v. M.Santhakumari and another (C.R.P.No.2939 of
“It is well settled that a statement made under Section 161
Cr.P.C. is not a substantive piece of evidence. However, in
view of the proviso to Sub-section (1) of Section 162 Cr.P.C.,
the statement can be used for the limited purpose of
contradicting the maker thereof in the manner set out in the
said proviso.”
Further, in National Insurance Co. Ltd. V. Saju P.Paul4, the
Apex Court took note of entire previous case law on the subject
mentioned and examined the question in the context of Section 147
of the M.V. Act. While allowing the appeal filed by the Insurance
Company by reversing the judgment in Saju P.Paul v. National
Insurance Co. Ltd.5 of the High Court, it was held on facts that since
the victim was traveling in offending vehicle as “gratuitous
passenger” and hence, the insurance company cannot be held liable
to suffer the liability arising out of accident on the strength of the
insurance policy. However, the Apex Court keeping in view the
benevolent object of the Act and other relevant factors arising in the
case, issued the directions against the Insurance Company to pay the
awarded sum to the claimants and then to recover the said sum from
the insured in the same proceedings by applying the principle of
“pay and recover”.
Recently, relying upon the said judgment, the Apex Court in
Manuara Khatun (1 supra) held that the direction to the Insurance
Company, being the insurer of the offending vehicle which was
found involved in causing accident due to negligence of its driver
needs to be issued directing them to first pay the awarded sum to
the claimants and then recover the paid awarded sum from the
owner of the offending vehicle in execution proceedings as per the
law laid down in Para No.26 of National Insurance Co. Ltd. V. Saju
P.Paul (3 supra).
It is not in dispute that the Innova Car was insured and
Ex.B2-Insurance Policy clearly indicates that the accident has
occurred during the policy period, it can be said that the deceased
was travelled as a gratuitous passenger in the crime vehicle. In Anu
the Apex Court while dealing with the case of gratuitous passenger
directed the insurer to pay the awarded sum to the claimant therein
and recover the same from the insured in the same proceedings.
For the aforesaid discussion and in view of the benevolence
object of the Motor Vehicles Act, even though the liability of
Insurance Company is exonerated, still the insurance company is
liable to pay the compensation to the claimants at the first instance
and then recover the same from the owner of the offending vehicle
by invoking the principle “pay and recover” as laid down by the Apex
Court in Manuara Khatun v. Rajesh Kr. Singh (1 supra).
Accordingly, the appeal is partly allowed by enhancing the
compensation amount awarded by the Tribunal from Rs.2,80,000/-
to Rs.3,50,000/- . The enhanced amount shall carry interest @ 7.5%
per annum from the date of passing of the order i.e., from 30.06.2010
till the date of realization. The 2nd respondent-Insurance Company
is directed to deposit the said amount to the credit of the O.P. along
with accrued interest within two months from the date of receipt of
a copy of this judgment, and then recover the said amount from the
1st respondent-owner. The enhanced amount shall be apportioned
among the claimants equally. There shall be no order as to costs.
Miscellaneous petitions, if any pending in this appeal, shall
stand dismissed.
