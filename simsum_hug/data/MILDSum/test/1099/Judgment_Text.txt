The petitioner is challenging the order dated 23.03.2021
(Annexure A-1) passed in Appeal Case No.48/2021/Registration by the
Appellate Authority-cum-Joint Commissioner, Goods and Services Tax,
2.           The brief facts shows that petitioner’s company was registered
under the Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017 and was alloted the registration
No.23AAICR6172RIZP. However, on account of non-filing of return, the
GST number allotted to the petitioner was cancelled. Against cancellation,
the petitioner preferred an appeal before the respondent No.4. The said
appeal has been dismissed vide order dated 23.03.2021, which is being
sought to be impugned in the present petition.
3.           No one appeared even in the second round when the case was
4.            Learned counsel for respondents submits that registration of the
petitioner was cancelled on 19.06.2019, against which the petitioner herein
preferred an appeal on 30.01.2021 and then the appeal was taken up on
16.03.2021, the Appellate Authority taking into consideration of provisions
under Section 107 of GST Act, dismissed the appeal as time barred.
5.            We have heard learned counsel for respondents and perused the
records produced by respondents.
6.            Perusal of the records shows that the order of cacellation of
registration was passed way back on 19.06.2019 and the appeal was
preferred by the petitioner on 30.01.2021. Thus, the appeal was preferred
almost after one and half years from the date of order of cancellation of
6.1           Section 107 (1) of GST Act provides that an appeal can be
preferred within a period of three (3) months from the date of the order,
while Section 107 (4) of the Act stipulates that the Appellate Authority, if
satisfied that the appellant was prevented by sufficient cause from presenting
the appeal within the period of limitation of 3 months, allow it to be
presented within a further period of one month.
6.2.   Thus, the total period during which the appeal ought to have been
preferred was four months from the date of cancellation of registration dated
19.06.2019. However, despite lapse of four months, the appeal was not
preferred by the appellant/petitioner, nor even in the memo of appeal,
sufficient reasons for not filing the appeal in time were disclosed. There was
unexplained delay of 1 ½ years in filing the appeal.
7.            Thus, in our considered view, the respondent No.4 has not
committed any error while dismissing the appeal preferred by the present
petitioner and therefore, we do not find any substance in the present petition.
Accordingly, the same stands dismissed.
