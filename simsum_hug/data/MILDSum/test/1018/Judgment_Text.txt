concerning the impugned tweet dated 11th May, 2022,

2.           List the petition for further hearing on 12 July 2022.
3.           The learned counsel for the Petitioner prays for the grant
of interim relief that the Petitioner be directed to be released on bail.
We have heard the learned counsel for the parties on this interim
4.           Several FIRs came to be filed against the Petitioner.
(i) FIR No.124/2022 at Naupada Police Station, Thane, on 13 May
2022 at 20.10 hours for the offence punishable under sections 107,
153, 153(A), 504, 506(2) of the Indian Penal Code. The FIR was in
respect of a post stated to be put up by the Petitioner on the social
media platform “Twitter” on 11 May 2022.
(ii)   In respect of the same tweet, FIR No.165/2022 was filed at
Dindori Police Station, Nashik, on 14 May 2022;
(iii) FIR No.13/2022 at Cyber Cell, Pune city on 14 May 2022;
(iv)   FIR No.570/2022 at Goregaon Police Station, Mumbai on 14
(v)    FIR No. 502/2022 at Bhoiwada Police Station, Mumbai on 14
(vi)   FIR No.292/2022 at Dehu Road Police Station, Pimpri
Chinchwad on 15 May 2022.
5.           It is common ground that these FIRs relate to the same
post on social media and are on the same allegations. The gist of the
allegations is that the Petitioner posted a message on the social media
platform, which was in respect of a senior political leader of the
ruling political party in the State, which post was intended to
promote enmity in different groups on religion, place of birth,
language etc.
6.           The Petitioner was arrested in respect of the offence
registered at Dindori Police Station, Nashik, Naupada Police Station,
Thane, Cyber Cell, Pune city and Dehu Road Police Station, Pimpri
Chinchwad on 13 May 2022.            As regards the FIR registered at
Dindori Police Station and Dehu Road Police Station, the Petitioner
has been released on bail by the learned Magistrate. As regards FIR
registered at Naupada Police Station and Cyber Cell, the Petitioner
filed applications before the learned Magistrate, which were rejected.
Regarding the order of rejection and for grant of bail, the Petitioner
and the State have not taken any further steps.        As a result, the
Petitioner has continued to be in custody since 13 May 2022.
7.           The learned counsel for the Petitioner submitted that
considering the facts and circumstances of the case, this is a fit case
where the prayer for grant of interim bail in a petition seeking to
quash FIR needs to be considered.         The learned counsel for the
Petitioner relied on the decision of the Supreme Court in the case of
skn                                    4               21-WP-1821.2022.doc
Arnab Manoranjan Goswami v. the State of Maharashtra 1.                   The
learned counsel for the Petitioner submitted that the Petitioner is a
student and all that he has done is a message on the social media, and
the FIR in respect of the said post do not prima facie indicate that
any offence is made out.        The learned counsel further submitted
that the continued custody of the Petitioner is entirely unwarranted
and keeping the Petitioner in custody has serious repercussions on
the society.      The learned counsel for the Petitioner submitted that
for the same post series of FIRs have been filed, which is entirely
unwarranted and impermissible in law.             The learned counsel
submitted that it would be unjust to drive the Petitioner to different
courts seeking bail in different FIRs.     The learned counsel further
submitted that it is not the case where the Petitioner would abuse the
liberty or tamper with the investigation if released on bail.
8.             The learned PP submitted that though it is correct that
interim bail in a petition under Article 226 of the Constitution of
India and under section 482 of the Cr.P.C. for quashing of FIR can
be considered, at the same time as stated in the decision in the case of
Arnab Manoranjan Goswami, the High Court will have to keep in
mind that exercise of power must be in circumspection and not a
substitute for the remedy of bail under section 439 of Cr.P.C.
Learned PP submitted that the Petitioner has antecedents and an FIR
No.134/2022 was lodged against the Petitioner at Vartaknagar Police
Station under section 294, 500, 507 of IPC read with section 66(a)
skn                                    5                21-WP-1821.2022.doc
9.           In the decision of Arnab Manoranjan Goswami, the
Supreme Court has considered the ambit of powers under Article
226 of the Constitution of India and under section 482 of Cr.P.C. for
grant of interim bail in a petition filed for quashing of FIR.             The
Supreme Court has observed that the High Court should not
foreclose itself from the exercise of powers when a citizen has been
arbitrarily deprived of personal liberty in the exercise of State powers,
apart from other parameters for consideration of bail. The interest
of the public or State or other considerations also have to be kept in
mind. We have considered rival contentions in the context of the
above position of law for consideration of the prayer.              For this
purpose, the totality of the circumstances will have to be considered.
10.          The Petitioner is a 22-year-old student.          The earlier
incident referred to by the learned PP is also in respect of electronic
communication. Apart from this, we have not been shown any
antecedents of the Petitioner. It cannot be said at this stage that the
argument of the Petitioner that bare perusal of the contents of the
Petitioner's post and the FIR, ingredient of the offence creating
disharmony between two groups is not made out, is incorrect.
Prima facie, we also find merit in the contention of the Petitioner
that multiple FIRs for the same post in different cities were against
the position of law and have resulted in great prejudice against the
Petitioner, a student who has to apply in different courts for bail.
skn                                    6              21-WP-1821.2022.doc
Regarding two such FIRs, the Petitioner has been granted bail, and
the State has not challenged the same. It has not been demonstrated
before us that if the Petitioner is released on bail, he will abuse the
liberty or interfere with the investigation.   Therefore, taking these
factors cumulatively, we find that a case is made out for the grant of
interim bail to the Petitioner.
11.           The learned counsel for the Petitioner submits that the
Petitioner has been released on bail on furnishing PR Bond of
Rs.15,000/- with solvent surety by the Judicial Magistrate, Dindori
and every FIR and bail order the Petitioner should not be directed to
give solvent surety. The request made is reasonable.
12.           Hence, the following order:
(i)           In respect of FIR No.124/2022 registered with Naupada
Police Station, Thane and FIR No.13/2022 registered with Cyber
Cell, Pune City, the Petitioner shall be released on bail after
furnishing P.R.Bond of Rs.15,000/-;
(ii)   In respect of FIR No.570/2022 registered with Goregaon
Police Station, Mumbai and FIR No.502/2022 registered with
Bhoiwada Police Station, Mumbai, the Petitioner shall not be
arrested till further orders;
As regards the conditions of bail, they have been so provided
skn                                      7              21-WP-1821.2022.doc
in the order passed by the learned Judicial Magistrate in respect of
FIR No.165/2022, and it is not necessary to direct any separate
conditions in this order.      The Petitioner is also asked to mark his
attendance at Dindori Police Station every Sunday, which according
to us, will suffice for the interim bail.
13.           Stand over to 12 July 2022. Reply, if any, to be filed
before the next date.
