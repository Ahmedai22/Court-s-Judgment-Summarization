 "This is an unfortunate case where the applicant delivered the child at about 2.30 pm and herself cut the umbilical cord with a knife. At the relevant time, she was residing with her sister-in-law," the bench said. 
 The police has booked the woman under Sections 317 (abandonment of a child below 12), 302 (murder), 201 (destruction of evidence) of Indian Penal Code, 1860. 
 In the bail order, the court noted that the woman has been in custody for over 2 years and 11 months and the charge sheet already stands filed. 
"No purpose will be served by prolonging the custody of the applicant â€“ a woman any further. The possibility of the trial commencing any time soon in the near future is remote," the bench said while granting her bail.
