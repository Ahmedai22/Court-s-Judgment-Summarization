2.           The challenge in this writ petition is to the order dated 6
September 2019 passed by Sub-divisional Officer-cum-Presiding
Officer of the Tribunal constituted under Section 7 of the
Maintenance And Welfare of Parents And Senior Citizens Act, 2007
(Act of 2007).
Vide order impugned herein, the Petitioners have been
directed to vacate and handover possession of room no.3/6, Gurukrupa
sg                                3/8                    12.wp4970-19.doc
Mumbai 400 060 (disputed premises) to Respondent No.3 within a
period of 15 days.
3.           Facts giving rise to the present petition are as follows:-
Respondent No.3 is step-mother of the Petitioners herein.
On the demise of mother of the Petitioners, their father-Vaijanath
married Respondent No.3. Vaijanath was serving with Morarji Mills.
He passed away in 2014. The disputed premises belonged to deceased
Vaijanath. Both the Petitioners were living separately from their father
and Respondent No.3. Both the Petitioners would visit the disputed
premises.     Both of them had occasionally stayed in the disputed
premises. Petitioner No.1 is gainfully employed. Petitioner No.2 is
differently abled (psychologically). Both the Petitioners would harass
and ill-treat Respondent No.3 on the demise of their father. It is the
case of Respondent No.3 that she was 60 plus and, thus, a senior
citizen.   It is her right to stay peacefully and comfortably in the
disputed premises. The Petitioners, by one or the other way, harassed
and ill- treated her and thereby made her living miserable.               She,
therefore, filed application to the tribunal and urged for eviction of the
Petitioners from the disputed premises.
4.           The Petitioners have their side of story to tell. According
sg                                4/8                   12.wp4970-19.doc
to them, their mother passed away when Petitioner Nos.1 and 2 were 8
and 1½ years of age, respectively.        Respondent No.3, being step-
mother, ill-treated the Petitioners. The Petitioners, therefore, took
shelter at the house of their maternal grand-mother. On the demise of
their grand-mother, the Petitioners came back to the disputed premises
and started living with their father and the step-mother/Respondent
No.3. According to them, Respondent No.3 earns her living. She has
been staying at her sister’s residence. The Petitioners have right, title
and interest in the disputed premises, since they inherited the same as
Class I heirs on the demise of their father. According to them, the
tribunal has only jurisdiction to grant maintenance in terms of
quantum of money. The tribunal has no jurisdiction to pass any other
order, specifically one in question in this writ petition.
5.           Both the learned Advocates made their submissions
consistent with their respective case referred to hereinabove. Learned
Advocate for the Petitioners further submitted that Respondent No.3
got her name recorded in the in the society record. She wanted to sell
out the disputed premises. The Petitioners, being Class I heirs of
deceased Vaijanath, have every right to stay in the disputed premises.
The impugned order herein is, thus, liable to be set aside.
6.           Considered the submissions advanced. Perused the order
impugned herein. Also gone through the authorities relied on.
sg                               5/8                12.wp4970-19.doc
7.           The Statement of Objects and Reasons of the Act of 2007
is – Traditional norms and values of the Indian society laid stress on
providing care for the elderly. However, due to withering of the joint
family system, a large number of elderly are not being looked after by
their family. Consequently, many older persons, particularly widowed
women are now forced to spend their twilight years all alone and are
exposed to emotional neglect and to lack of physical and financial
support. This clearly reveals that ageing has become a major social
challenge and there is a need to give more attention to the care and
protection for the older persons.       Though the parents can claim
maintenance under the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973, the
procedure is both time-consuming as well as expensive. Hence, there is
a need to have simple, inexpensive and speedy provisions to claim
maintenance for parents.
Section 2(b) of the Act of 2007 defines the term
“maintenance” to include provision for food, clothing, residence and
medical attendance and treatment. Sub-clause (d) of Section 2 defines
the term “parent” to mean father or mother whether biological,
adoptive or step father or step mother, as the case may be, whether or
not the father or the mother is a senior citizen.
8.           It is true that the tribunal has jurisdiction to grant
sg                              6/8                  12.wp4970-19.doc
maintenance allowance not exceeding Rs.10,000/- per month. Section
5 of the Act of 2007 speaks of application for maintenance. If one
goes by the definition of the term maintenance, it includes a provision
for residence.
9.           The disputed premises originally belonged to late
Vaijanath. There is nothing to support the claim of the Petitioners that
Vaijanath was unemployed and the disputed premises was purchased
out of the funds provided by their natural mother. True, on the demise
of Vaijanath, the Petitioners and Respondent No.3, being Class I heirs,
inherited the disputed premises and thereby became entitled to occupy
the said premises. During the submission advanced by the learned
Advocates for the parties, it has come on record that the disputed
premises are vacant. Both the Petitioners have been residing in a
premises taken on rent. For non-payment of electricity charges, electric
supply of the premises has been discontinued. Other dues of the
society, such as maintenance and drainage charges, etc., are
outstanding. Respondent No.3 is said to have been residing at her
sister’s house.  Necessarily the same is at the mercy of her sister.
Respondent No.3 is above 65 years of age. Being one of the Class I
heirs of deceased Vaijanath, she is entitled to reside in the disputed
premises. Learned Advocate for the Petitioners submitted before this
Court that Vaijanath did not leave behind any other property. It is the
case of Respondent No.3 that deceased was allotted a room as he was
sg                                7/8                    12.wp4970-19.doc
in service with Morarji Mills. It is the specific case of Respondent
No.3 that all the papers in relation to the said room are with Petitioner
No.1-Mayur, who is little over 45 years of age. He is admittedly
gainfully employed.       Petitioner No.2 is psychologically disabled.
Petitioner No.1 takes her care. He admits to have been residing in a
room taken on rent. Respondent No.3, being in the evening of her
life, does need comfort and peace.            The relations between the
Petitioners and her were strained. She being the stepmother of the
Petitioners, there is no likelihood of all of them residing together
peacefully in a disputed premises. In the facts and circumstances of the
case, the tribunal was, therefore, justified to pass the order directing the
Petitioners to vacate the dispute premises and handover its possession
to Respondent No.3. The Court finds no reason to interfere with the
impugned order. True, the Petitioners have a reasonable apprehension
that Respondent No.3 may create third party interest in respect of the
disputed premises or may bring her sister and her relations to stay with
10.          This Court is, therefore, inclined to direct Respondent
No.3 not to create any third party interest in respect of the disputed
premises, which would be prejudicial to the right, title and interest of
the Petitioners herein.
11.  With the aforesaid direction, the writ petition is dismissed.
