The petitioner has filed the present petition seeking
quashment of Annexure P/1 and P/2 whereby she has been
denied for compassionate appointment as well as ex-gratia
/compensation by the respondents. The petitioner is also
claiming gratuity and pension w.e.f. 1998.
(2)    Facts of the case in short are as under:
(a). The husband of the petitioner, Shri Ashok Dhaigude
left the house on 19.12.1998 to go to bank but he went missing.
In the year 1998 he was working as peon in the State Bank of
Indore, which latter on merged into State Bank of India. The
petitioner gave information about his missing to the Police as
well as bank. When he did not return, after seven years, the
petitioner    submitted     an    application   for compassionate
appointment and payment of all retiral dues. Vide letter dated
12.01.2006, the Head office of the Bank has treated Ashok
Dhaigude voluntarily retired w.e.f. 20.10.1998 on account of his
missing and directed Regional Office, Indore of SBI             to
complete necessary formalities for settlement of terminal dues
in favour of the petitioner being a nominee viz payment of
provident fund, gratuity          and ex-gratia compensation. A

declaration or indemnity bond was also directed to be obtained
from petitioner in case Ashok Dhaigude joins the duties and
claims the provident fund then entire amount would be
recovered from her or said amount would be adjusted in the
retiral benefit granted to the petitioner. According to the
petitioner the respondents /bank have calculated and paid all
benefit like gratuity, EPF treating her husband to be dead on
21.10.2005 whereas, he had been treated voluntarily retired
from services 21.10.1998.
(b). The petitioner has been denied for compassionate
appointment because the new policy came into force w.e.f.
10.01.2006 and in which there is provision of ex-gratia payment
in lieu of compassionate appointment. According to the
petitioner since her husband had been treated dead in the year
2005 and retiral benefit were paid, then the policy came into
2006 would not apply in her case. The petitioner submitted
representation for compassionate appointment on 06.06.2008,
which was replied by the respondent vide letter dated
19.09.2008 that arrears of family pension from 22.10.2005 to
31.08.2008 Rs.1,47,9221.80/- deposited in the account.
(c). The petitioner submitted an affidavit that her
husband went missing on 21.10.1998 and he had been treated to
be dead w.e.f. 20.10.2005, she has not remarried so far. She
again submitted a representation on 05.12.2008 claiming arrears
of pension from 21.10.1998 till 21.10.2005 followed by

representation by representation dated 15.12.2010. When no
action was taken, then petitioner filed present petition before
(d). After notice, the respondents               have filed reply
mentioning the undisputed facts of the petition in para, which
2.     That, the undisputed facts of this petition are as under:
(i).    That, the said Shri Ashok Dhaigude (the said ex-
employee) absented from the duties in the erstwhile bank from
20.10.1998 and as such, the erstwhile bank treated him to have
voluntarily retired from service w.e.f. 20.10.2005, in terms of
the relevant provisions of the Bipartite Settlement applicable to
(ii).   That, having treated the said ex-employee as '
voluntarily retired' the erstwhile bank has paid his gratuity/PF
to the petitioner against indemnity bond, copies placed as the
Annexure R/1 and R/2.
(iii). That, the petitioner applied for family pension after 7
years from missing of the said ex-employee and as such she is
also being paid family pension with effect from 2005 (page 17
and 18 of Annexure P/4).
(iv). That, the petitioner has been declined compassionate
appointment on the ground that the scheme of compassionate
appointment was discontinued in the erstwhile bank with effect
from 10.01.2006 whereas the petitioner applied for the said
appointment to the erstwhile bank on 30.09.2007 i.e. after the
said scheme was discontinued/abolished.
(v). That, the petitioner's demand for payment of family
pension from 20.10.1998 (i.e. from the date of disappearance of
her husband), instead from 21.10.2005 (i.e. the date when 7
years of his disappearance were completed), has also been
declined.
(e). In para 3 the respondents have given pointwise reply
about denial of compassionate appointment, payment of ex-

gratia and denial of payment gratuity and pension from 1998,
3.    That, the disputes involved in the present petition are:
A.    Dispute regarding compassionate appointment
(i)      That, the petitioner has impugned the bank's decision of
refusing to give her compassionate appointment. The
petitioner's contention is that she was eligible for
compassionate appointment on 21.10.2005 i.e. the date when 7
years of missing of her husband were over and as the scheme
for compassionate appointment was discontinued with effect
from 10.01.2006, she should be given the said appointment
irrespective of the fact as to when she applied.
(ii)     That, the bank's contention is that since the relative
scheme was discontinued from 10.01.2006 and she had applied
for the said appointment for the first time through her
advocate's notice dated 03.09.2007, copy placed as the
Annexure P/3, she is not eligible for the said compassionate
appointment. The petitioner has therefore impugned the bank's
relative communication to her which are placed at the
Annexure P/1 and P/2.
(iii)    That, in support of its foregoing contention, the bank
relies on the case reported at 2010 (3) MPLJ 213 (Bank of
Maharashtra Vs Manoj Kumar Dehariya) wherein this Hon'ble
Court has held that compassionate appointment is not a vested
right and when grant of such appointment is governed by the
Rules and Policies prevailing in an establishment, then
consideration as per Rules is required to be made and
consideration on the basis of a policy which has been given up
by the employer and which has no application at that point of
time, cannot be insisted upon.
(iv)     That, in the light of the aforesaid judgment of this
Hon'ble Court, it is obvious that the petitioner is not entitled for
compassionate appointment and as such she has rightly been
declined the said appointment on the ground that when she
applied therefore, the relative scheme in the erstwhile bank had
been abolished/discontinued.
B.     Dispute regarding payment of Ex-gratia amount in lieu
of Compassionate Appointment.
(i). That, the petitioner has although never made any
application for payment of 'Ex-gratia Lumpsum Amount in lieu
of Compassionate Appointment' (hereinafter referred to as
Smt. Meena Dhaigude V/s. Maha Pravandhak State Bank of India.
the “ ex-gratia payment”), she has falsely alleged in the
petition that the bank's decision for not paying the said ex-
gratia payment/compensation to her, is illegal. As she has never
applied for the said ex-gratia payment, there is no question of
declining the same and as such, the aforesaid allegation made
in the petition is absolutely false.
(ii). That, the bank also submits that the petitioner cannot
make two demands simultaneously. Either she should ask for
compassionate appointment or for ex-gratia lumpsump amount
in lieu of compassionate appointment. However, a bare reading
of the erstwhile bank's scheme for the said ex-gratia payment,
placed as Annexure P/6, would reveal that (a) as per its clause
No. 15(v), the said scheme is not applicable to the families of
missing persons and only the Board of Directors of the
erstwhile bank was entrusted to consider such cases (b) the said
clause 15(v) also stipulates that the Bank's Board of Directors
can consider such a case if the employees missing for more
than 7 years, has been declared ' dead' by the Court (c) as per
clause 11 of the said Scheme, the time limit for submitting the
relative application was only 6 months of the date of death.
(iii). That, in this case, since 21.10.2005, the 7 years of
missing of the petitioner's husband (the said ex-employee) were
over and he was presumed as 'dead' as on 21.10.2005, the
petitioner is now not entitled to make an application for
payment of the said ex-gratia amount in view of the said clause
11 of the said Scheme. It is also noteworthy that the erstwhile
bank is no more in existence.
In view of the foregoing, at the outset, the petitioner is not
eligible for the said ex-gratia payment also.
C.     Disputes regarding payment of Gratuity and Pension
from 1998.
(i). That, the petitioner has also prayed for a relief that the
respondent bank should be directed to pay the gratuity and
pension from the year 1998. To substantiate, the petitioner has
averred that since her husband (the said ex-employee) has been
treated to have retired with effect from 21.10.1998, she is
eligible for benefits of gratuity and pension from 21.10.1998
instead from 21.10.2005 when 7 years of missing of her
husband (the said ex-employee) were over and he was
presumed to be 'dead'.
(ii). That, the bank submits that the petitioner is getting
family pension for which she became eligible only after her
husband (the said ex-employee) was presumed to be 'dead'. As
the said presumption could be made only on 21.10.2005 when
Smt. Meena Dhaigude V/s. Maha Pravandhak State Bank of India.
the period of 7years of missing of her husband (the said ex-
employee) was completed, it is obvious that the petitioner's
demand that she should be paid the said pension from the date
of treating her husband as 'voluntarily retired' and not from the
date when he was presumed as 'dead', does not have any merit.
(iii). That, so far as payment of gratuity from the date the said
ex-employee has been treated to have 'voluntarily retired' is
concerned, it is submitted that the said erstwhile bank had
“State Bank of Indore (Payment of Gratuity to Employees)
Regulations, 1975. In its Rule 13 read with Rule 12(1) (V), the
method of calculation of the amount of gratuity inter-alia to an
employee voluntarily retired after completion of 10 years
service, has been given. As the petitioner has been paid the
amount of gratuity of the said ex-employee from the year 2005
instead from the year 1998. The excerpt of the said Rule 13 and
Rule 12 of the said Regulations are placed as the Annexure
P/4. It is also submitted that the said Regulations being legal
fiction, have got the binding effect.
(3). I have heard learned counsel for the parties and perused
the record.
(4). As per the undisputed facts of this case, the husband of the
petitioner Shri        Ashok Dhaigude remained absent in the
erstwhile bank from 20.10.1998 , hence a notice was issued to
him to join the duties. The petitioner and respondents have
accepted that he did not return to home or bank therefore he has
been treated as a dead person w.e.f. 20.10.2005. According to
the respondents , the petitioner applied for grant of family
pension after seven years of the missing of her husband,
therefore, they have paid the pension and other admissible
benefits to her from the year 2005. The petitioner has been
denied compassionate appointment in view of the scheme came
into force w.e.f. 10.01.2006 as she applied for a compassionate
appointment on 03.09.2007. Despite the denial of the
Smt. Meena Dhaigude V/s. Maha Pravandhak State Bank of India.
compassionate appointment, respondents        have also denied the
ex-gratia compensation by placing reliance clause No.15(v) of
the scheme because the same does not apply to the family of
missing person and the time limit for submitting the relative
application was only 6 months of the date of death. Since the
seven years of missing of petitioner's husband had been passed
on 21.10.2005 and he was presumed as dead as on 21.10.2005
hence, the petitioner is not entitled to the ex-gratia
compensation in view of clause 11 of the scheme.
(5). According to respondents since the petitioner's husband
was presumed to be dead on 21.10.2005 i.e. after seven years of
the missing there she became entitled to payment of pension and
gratuity from the said date.      It is further submitted by the
respondent that the petitioner has been paid gratuity amount by
adopting the method of calculation provided under rule 12 (1)
(v) and read with Rule 13 of State Bank of Indore (Payment of
Gratuity to Employees), Regulations, 1975 w.e.f. 2005.
(6). The petitioner is a widow of a class IV employee, and she
has somehow survived with two minor children after her
husband left them at the mercy of God. She has submitted the
representation that she be provided with a temporary job or
engaged as a daily wager so that she could maintain her
children. I have never come across any such case in which,
such a harsh approach has been adopted by an employer like
respondents. That thousands of employees work in such a big

organization like SBI and it is least expected from them to have
behaved like the model employer.
(7). That husband of the petitioner went missing 19.12.1998,
when he did not join the duties from 20.10.1998, the Branch
Manager sent a letter to the house of the petitioner on
21.01.1999 calling upon him to join the duties within 30 days
from the date of receipt of notice failing which he would be
treated as voluntarily retired from the services. The petitioner
submitted a reply that since 21.10.1998 she has no information
about her husband as he has left the house without leaving any
note. She gave information to the police about missing and
requested respondents for not taking any action. She submitted a
representation on 17.05.1999 that it is becoming very difficult
for her to survive with two minor sons aged about 14 years and
12 years, her husband had served the bank          for 22 years,
therefore she may be engaged temporary or daily wages in place
of her husband so that she would maintain her family but no
heed was given to the aforesaid representation. Vide letter dated
11.11.2005, the Superintendent of Police Indore informed the
petitioner that they could not find her husband and as per law
since seven years had been over hence he was treated as dead.
That on 06.06.2008 the petitioner submitted a representation
that her husband be now treated dead on 20.10.2005, hence, her
claim for    compassionate appointment be reconsidered. The
Smt. Meena Dhaigude V/s. Maha Pravandhak State Bank of India.
respondents have settled her pension payable from 20.10.2005
and paid the gratuity amount to her.
(8). The respondents have wrongly denied the compassionate
appointment to the petitioner on the ground that, the new policy
has come into force w.e.f. 01.01.2006. As per clause 3 of the
policy this scheme will replace all existing compassionate
appointment schemes and no request for compassionate
appointment shall be entertained or considered by the bank
under any circumstances with effect from 10.01.2006. Clause 4
provides the payment of ex-gratia lumpsum amount in case of
an employee dying in harness and employees seeking premature
retirement due to incapacitation before reaching the age of 55
years. The Apex Court in the case of Canara Bank & another
Vs. M. Mahesh Kumar reported in 2015 (7) SCC 412 has held
that an application for compassionate appointment should be
considered as per the policy prevailing at the time of death of
the employee. Admittedly, in this case, the husband of the
petitioner was treated to be dead w.e.f. 20.10.2005 and the new
policy came into force w.e.f. 10.01.2006, hence, the respondents
ought to have considered the claim of the petitioner for
compassionate     appointment     policy  prevailing   prior    to
10.01.2006 or at the time of death. Hence, respondents are
directed to consider the claim of the petitioner for a
compassionate appointment. Now due to the passage of time her
sons have become major now hence if she submits an affidavit
Smt. Meena Dhaigude V/s. Maha Pravandhak State Bank of India.
to the effect then a claim of compassionate appointment be
considered for her any of the sons .
(9). So far payment of gratuity and passionary benefits are
concerned same are liable to be released after the death of an
employee or attaining the age of superannuation or voluntarily
resigning from the services of the bank after 10 years completed
from the service. Since the husband of the petitioner was treated
to be dead on 20.10.2005 and held that the petitioner is entitled
to get a compassionate appointment on a policy prevailing on
20.10.2005, therefore, all the benefits are liable to be paid
treating the petitioner's husband dead on 20.10.2005.
(10). There is no such order has been placed on record by
respondents by which husband of the petitioner has been treated
as voluntarily retired on 20.10.1998. That only in the letter dated
12.01.2006, Head Office of SBI has directed Regional Office to
annex the order treating the petitioner's husband voluntarily
retired on 20.10.1998 for submitting the claim of provident fund
and ex-gratia payment, therefore there is no such order on
record, hence, all the claims of the petitioner are liable to be
considered treating him dead w.e.f. 20.10.2005 and accordingly,
all the retiral benefits are liable to be calculated and be paid to
(11). So far as payment of ex-gratia compensation is concerned,
the bank has rejected the claim of the petitioner on the ground
of delay in view of policy dated 24.01.2006 which came into
Smt. Meena Dhaigude V/s. Maha Pravandhak State Bank of India.
force w.e.f.10.01.2006 but it has been held in the above paras
that new policy will not apply in case of the petitioner,
therefore, the question of ex-gratia compensation is not liable to
be considered. However, it is observed that there was no delay
in submission of application for ex-gratia compensation because
the husband of the petitioner was treated dead on 21.10.2005
and policy came into force w.e.f. 10.01.2006 and representations
submitted by the petitioner were already pending for grant of
compassionate appointment.
(12). In my considered opinion it is a fit case in which
exemplary cost should be imposed on the respondents for their
inhuman approach. The way Respondents has dealt with the
issue of the widow and children of class IV employee it is liable
to denounce with the strong words deprecated. The husband of
the petitioner was a class-IV employee before he went missing
he had served 22 years with the respondents. It is equivalent to
the case of dying in harshness for the family. The petitioner had
to work as a domestic maid in the house of others to survive
herself as well as her sons. She requested respondents          to
provide the temporary appointment or daily wager so that she
could maintain the family. It is not a case of the petitioner that
she was not qualified for an appointment for a class IV
employee or as a daily wager. If an employee went missing and
not coming for duties months together then it is the case dying
in harshness. The respondents have treated him voluntarily

retired w.e.f. 20.10.1998 then they ought to have started paying
pension from 1998 to the petitioner and other retiral benefits to
ensure their survival. They kept the matter pending for seven
years to get a declaration that her husband is no more without
considering that how the family of the petitioner would survive
for seven years. An equally facet of right to life is the right to
livelihood because no person can live without the means of
living, that is the means of livelihood. The right to live a
dignified life has been taken by the respondents in this case.
Respondents could have paid her some monthly amount like
half of the salary payable to her missing husband because they
were in control of all retiral dues of her husband with them,
therefore, the approach of bank         was inhuman towards the
family of class-IV employee.
(13). This petition is pending since 2012 before this Court. The
petitioner has also drawn attention to this Court towards the
bank statements which reflects that w.e.f.12.10.2012 the pension
has been reduced from Rs.6499/- and Rs. 6869/- to Rs. 3583/-
and Rs. 3969/- and there is no reply to the said reduction in this
petition. There is no reason as to why her pension has been
reduced and since 2012 her family is surviving with only Rs.
3500/- per month. This petition deserves to be allowed and is
accordingly allowed with costs of Rs. 2,00,000/- (Rupees Two
Lac only) payable to the petitioner.
