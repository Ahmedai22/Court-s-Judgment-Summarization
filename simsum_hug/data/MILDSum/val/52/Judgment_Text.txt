1.      Rule. Rule made returnable forthwith. With the consent of the
parties heard finally.
2.      The petitioner has filed the present writ petition seeking
direction to the respondent No.4 – Head Master, Zillha Parishad
Primary School, Murti, Tq. Ghansawangi, Dist. Jalna, to correct the
date of birth in the school record where the petitioner was studying
from 22/01/1991 to 22/08/1993.
3.      It is the case of the petitioner that his actual date of birth is
22/08/1993 and at the time of admission at Anganwadi, his date of
birth was correctly recorded. At the time of his admission to 1 st
Standard in the respondent No.4- Zillha Parishad Primary School,
Murti,     his    birth      date was wrongly entered     as    22/02/1991.
Accordingly, the same birth date was mentioned in the School
Leaving Certificate. The father of the petitioner, thereafter, filed an
application dated 10/11/2021, for correction of the school record.
The application filed by the father of the petitioner, was forwarded to
respondent No.2 - Education Officer (Primary) for correction of the
birth date in the school record. The petitioner had also filed Criminal
Misc. Application No.90 of 2021, before the Judicial Magistrate
(F.C.), Ghansawangi, independently for recording of his birth date,
under the Registration of Births and Deaths Act, 1969.                         He
contended in the said application that he was born on 22/08/1993.
In support of the said application, he filed evidence in the form of a
certificate given by Gramsevak, copy of public notice issued in daily
newspaper ‘Anand Nagri’, dated 07/01/2022.          On the basis of the
said evidence, the Judicial Magistrate (F.C.) Ghansawangi, had
decided the said Criminal Application and had directed to register the
entry of birth of the petitioner as 22/08/1993 in the concerned
register on payment of prescribed fee. All these records were filed
with the application which was forwarded to respondent No.2 -
Education officer (Primary). The petitioner has approached this Court
seeking a direction to the respondents, particularly respondent Nos.2
and 3, to direct them to correct the petitioner’s birth date in the
school record.
4.      The issue of change of birth date in school record has been
considered by the Full Bench Judgment of this Court, in the case of
Janabai        d/o       Himmatrao Thakur     Vs.        The      State        of
Maharashtra and Ors., reported in 2020 (1) ALL MR 360 (F.B.),
wherein it has been held at paragraphs No.23, 24 as under :-
“23.             We now come to the core issue in hand, namely :
“(A) Whether an application seeking alteration,
change or correction in the name, surname, date
of birth, caste, or other entries entered in the
General Register, including correction in spelling of
name, surname, date of birth, caste, as recorded
in the General Register, shall be entertained by or
on behalf of the pupil who has left the school and
the change in the aforesaid entries, is necessitated
for the purposes like securing an admission to
another educational institution and the School
Leaving Certificate is relied upon as an evidence
for name, surname, caste, date of birth, etc.”
(emphasis suppied)
The consideration of this issue depends upon the language of
Clause 26.3 and 26.4 of the S.S. Code, which read as under:
1      No alteration in the date of          Application for change or
birth or other entries in the        correction of date of birth,

shall be verified with the
24.              A look at the comparative       table above,           will
demonstrate the marked differences between the language of
Clauses 26.3 and 26.4 of the S.S. Code and will indicate that
they overlap and also operate in different fields at the same
time. While Clause 26.3, permits change of the entries in the
General Register, it, at the same time restricts the time span
and the nature of the change in respect of certain entries
therein after a student/pupil has left school, which is indicated
by the Third sentence of Clause 26.3.             The restriction is
demonstrated by the absolute embargo cast upon any change
in the date of birth, except for the obvious error as indicated
therein, after a student has left school, as is indicated by the
second sentence in Clause 26.3. It would not be out of context
to point out here that Clause 26.3, does not speak of the
School Leaving certificate at all.  In consonance with this the
Second sentence of Clause 26.4, continues this prohibition, of
not permitting any change at the behest of a pupil who has left
school, as the same according to the language used not only
amounts to a change in the entries in the General Register, but
in the school leaving certificate also. The third sentence in
Clause 26.4, however permits any change in the entries as
recorded in the School Leaving Certificate, only so as to bring
these entries in consonance with the existing entries in the
General Register. Thus a conjoint reading of the various
sentences in Clauses 26.3 and 26.4, with each other, leads us
to the following conclusion :
(a)           an application for alteration in the entries in
the General Register is permissible, with the
previous   permission    of     the   appropriate
authority at any time when the pupil is
attending the school.
(b)          No application for alteration in the figure of
date of birth is permissible, after the student
has left secondary school, except correction in
the nature of obvious mistakes as indicated in
Clause 26.3 i.e. of a nature where the date of
a particular month which does not exist in the
calendar and likewise.
(c)          An application for change in the spelling of
the name, or for that matter in the name,
surname or caste are errors which fall within
the category of obvious mistakes, and thus
can be made, even after the student has left
school in light of the language of Clause 26.3.
(d)      For the purposes like an admission to another
educational     institution,    in     cases     of   obvious
mistakes     as   prescribed        in   Clause      26.4,       a
change/correction        in    the      school       leaving
certificate, so as to make the entry consistent
with the corresponding entries in the General
Register of the School is permissible, which in
fact is in consonance with (c) above.”
5.      At paragraph No.39 of the said Judgment of Janabai (Supra),
this Court concluded as under :-
“39.            This being the position, We answer Question
Nos.(A) & (C) in the following terms :
(a)      An application for alteration in the entries
in the General Register is permissible, with the
previous       permission       of      the    appropriate
authority     at  any     time    when       the    pupil     is
attending the school.
(b)      No application for alteration in the figure
of date of birth is permissible, after the student
has left secondary school, except correction in
the nature of 'obvious mistakes' as indicated in
Clause 26.3 i.e. of a nature where the date of a
particular month which does not exist in the
calendar and likewise. (emphasis supplied)
(c)      Thus, in light of the above, an application
for change in the name, surname or caste,
either due to reasons / cause unnoticed before
or even occurring subsequently, being errors
which fall within the category of 'obvious
mistakes', can be made, even after the student
has left school in light of the language of Clause
26.3 in the manner as indicated by Appendix
Six in the forms as prescribed in the S.S. Code.
(d)       For the purposes like admission to another
educational institution, in cases of obvious
mistakes       as   prescribed   in    Clause     26.4,      a
change/correction        in   the     school      leaving
certificate, so as to make the entry consistent
with the corresponding entries in the General
Register of the School is permissible, which in
fact is in consonance with (c) above.”
6.      In the Judgment of Janabai (Supra), the Full Bench of this
Court laid down the parameters under which the birth date in school
entry can be altered. The Full Bench in the above case at paragraph
No.39 has held that no application for alteration in the figure of the
date of birth is permissible after the student has left secondary
school, except correction in the nature of ‘obvious mistake’, where
the date of a particular month which does not exist in the calendar
and likewise.
7.      The petitioner had applied for correction of the birth date in
the school record after he had left the school and as such in view of
the aforesaid Judgment of Janabai (Supra), the petitioner’s prayer
for change, which is not in the nature of ‘obvious mistake’, cannot
be accepted. Thus, the present writ petition cannot be entertained.
Hence, this petition is dismissed. Rule is discharged.
