Till the final disposal of the main petition the respondents may
kindly be restrained not to interfere or disturb or to user and
possession of the Petitioner in the land.”
4.       During pendency of the writ petition, a notification dated 06.05.2016 under
the 1903 Act was published in respect of the land comprised in the area
lying within the distance of 1000 yards from the crest of the outer perimeter
wall of Military Station at Sukhlapur in the District of Jabalpur in the State
of Madhya Pradesh, directing that this land be kept free from construction
of buildings and other obstructions from the date of publication of the
notification. The notification also imposes the restrictions specified in
clause (b) of Section 7 of the 1903 Act.
5.       In view of the aforesaid notification, Writ Petition (C) No. 21481 of 2013
was disposed of, vide judgment and order dated 30.08.2017, making
reference to Sections 4 and 5 of the 1903 Act, with the direction that it was
obligatory on the part of the appellants to proceed further and pay

damages on account of restrictions imposed regarding use of the land.
“(i) That the respondents shall take appropriate steps to
determine the damages and payment of damages to the
petitioners on account of imposition of restrictions in regard to
use of lands after publication of notification under Section 3 of
the Act of 1903 within a period of six months from the date of
receipt of copy of this order.
(ii) If the respondents fail to pay damages and will not
determine the same within the stipulated period, the
petitioners are at liberty to take appropriate action and
they are at liberty to file appropriate proceedings in
accordance with law. The petitioners can also challenge
the notification issued under Section 3 of the Act of 1903
quoted above in the order. No order as to costs.”
6.       Alleging non-compliance, the respondents had filed Contempt Case No.
1014 of 2018, which was disposed of by order dated 06.04.2018 directing
the appellants to comply with the order dated 30.08.2017 passed in Writ
Petition (C) No. 21481 of 2013 within a further period of six months from
the date of receipt of certified copy of that order. Liberty was also given to
the respondents to file another contempt petition, if required, with the
observation that costs would be imposed and recovered from the erring
officer.
7.       The respondents, again alleging non-compliance, filed the second
Contempt Case No. 2959 of 2018 on or about 23.10.2018, a copy of which
is not available on record. The appellants, in response to the contempt
petition filed affidavits stating that vide letter dated 24.08.2018 they had
Civil Appeal arising out of SLP(C) No. 8579 of 2021                                   Page 3 of 9
requested the Collector, Jabalpur to intimate the amount of compensation
to be paid to the owners for the restrictions imposed. This was followed by
the Ministry’s letter dated 13.09.2018 to the Chief Secretary, Government
of Madhya Pradesh to issue directions to the Collector to take necessary
action for computation of the compensation and payment. The Collector,
Jabalpur, however, incorrectly invoked provisions of the Right to Fair
Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and
Resettlement Act, 2013 and asked the local military authority to deposit
more than Rs.10.55 crores.                 It is obvious that the determination was
erroneous.
8.       The appellants thereupon were compelled to approach the revenue
authorities once again stating that the compensation should be determined
in terms of Sections 23 and 24 of the 1903 Act and not under the Right to
Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation
and Resettlement Act, 2013. Thereafter, several letters were exchanged
between the appellants and the local authorities.                On 03.08.2019, the
Collector, Jabalpur, informed the appellants that total cost of the land on
the said date was valued at Rs.16,39,35,000/- and that the compensation
amount payable was Rs.6,06,92,170/-.                    The appellants once again
protested vide letter dated 09.08.2019 to the Collector stating that the
compensation should not be computed on the actual cost of the land, but
determined in terms of provisions of Sections 23 and 24 of the 1903 Act.

Finding merit in the said objection, the Collector undertook fresh exercise
and determined the compensation vide his award dated 27.09.2019 fixing it
at Rs.1,96,97,200/-.
9.       The second contempt petition was dismissed by the Single Judge
recording that an award dated 27.09.2019 had been passed and the
proposal had been sent to the Ministry of Defence for disbursement of the
awarded amount. Liberty was granted to the respondents to approach the
appropriate forum in case grievance would exist, observing that the
question of limitation would not be a bar.
10.      On or about 06.03.2020, the respondents filed the third Contempt Case
No. 708 of 2020 in which the impugned order dated 24.06.2021 has been
passed, inter alia observing that the appellants had already deposited
Rs.1,96,97,200/-           before      the Collector and this amount  may       be
released/disbursed to the respondents within fifteen days.
11.      The appellants are not satisfied and are disputing the compensation of
Rs.1,96,97,200/- determined by the Collector. They have, accordingly, filed
a reference before the District Judge under Section 18 of the 1903 Act.
They have approached the Collector with an application that the amount of
Rs.1,96,97,200/- should not be released/disbursed to the respondents. In
addition, the appellants filed an application before the High Court in the
Civil Appeal arising out of SLP(C) No. 8579 of 2021                           Page 5 of 9
contempt proceedings seeking reference of the award under Section 18 of
the 1903 Act. They had also filed an affidavit requesting the High Court to
drop the contempt proceedings and call upon the respondents to
participate in the proceedings under Section 18 of the 1903 Act.
12.      To add to the aforesaid confusion, the appellants, it appears, have, post
the impugned order, passed an order dated 02.07.2021 under Section 3 of
the 1903 Act, determining the compensation @ 5% of the land, i.e.
Rs.30,45,200/-. Addition of 15% in terms of Section 23(2) of the 1903 Act,
i.e. Rs.4,56,700/- has been made. Total amount of compensation as
determined is Rs.35,01,980/-. This order observes that the respondents
would be entitled to interest on compensation @ 6% per annum in terms of
Section 34 of the 1903 Act.
13.      We have referred to the aforesaid proceedings to highlight that the
contempt proceedings have, in the present case, proceeded as if all issues
and questions that required determination and adjudication. The orders
passed in the second and third contempt petitions have, therefore, gone
beyond the scope and ambit of the order dated 30.08.2017 passed in Writ
Petition (C) No. 21481 of 2013. The impugned order and the directions
given therein, therefore, cannot be sustained and are liable to be set aside.
Ordered accordingly.

14.      However, for doing complete justice and for ensuring that there is no
further confusion, we are inclined to pass the following directions:
(a)      The reference petition pending before the 29th Additional District
Judge,        Jabalpur         in Case No.    MJC/6337/2020        CNR:
MP200L0195912020 filed by the appellants against the determination
of compensation amount by the Collector, Jabalpur, be decided
expeditiously and in accordance with law. Before proceeding with the
said reference on merits, the court may examine the preliminary
objection of the respondents that reference at the instance of the
appellants being beneficiary, is not maintainable.
(b)      The respondents would be also at liberty to file a reference before the
District Judge for enhancement of the compensation.
(c)      The reference filed by appellants be decided uninfluenced by the fact
that the appellants had failed to pass any order under Section 3 of
the 1903 Act or that the order dated 02.07.2021 has been passed
post the impugned order.
(d)      It will be open to the appellants to apply for stay against
disbursement of the compensation amount lying deposited with the
Collector, Jabalpur. Equally, it will be open to the respondents to
approach the Collector for release of the amount to them.           Such
applications be decided on its own merits and in accordance with law.

All contentions and further remedies available to both sides are left
open.
(e)      We clarify that we have not commented on any of the above aspects
or on the question of computation of compensation as the said issue
has to be determined in the reference.
15.     The civil appeal is allowed in the above terms. Pending application(s), if
any, also stand disposed of.
