The Supreme Court set aside the Madhya Pradesh High Court order that directed the disbursal of the amount of about Rs. 1.96 crore deposited by Defence Ministry with Collector as compensation to land owners.
Land owners of about 51.57 acres in Jabalpur had filed the writ petition before the Madhya Pradesh High court alleging that they were being obstructed by the Defence Ministry from carrying out any kind of activities on their land. This writ petition was disposed of with a direction to authorities to take appropriate steps to determine the damages and payment of damages to the landowners on account of imposition of restrictions.
The Collector, Jabalpur, initially, invoked provisions of the Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, 2013 and asked the local military authority to deposit more than Rs.10.55 crores. Faced with this, the ministry approached the to approachedÂ  the revenue authorities stating that the compensation should be determined in terms of Sections 23 and 24 of the Works of Defence Act, 1903 and not under the 2013 Act. The Collector undertook fresh exercise and determined the compensation vide his award dated 27.09.2019 fixing it at Rs.1,96,97,200.
In a contempt petition filed, the High court noted that the ministry had already deposited Rs.1,96,97,200/- before the Collector and this amount may be released/disbursed to the respondents within fifteen days. Against this order, the Apex Court was approached.

Before proceeding with the said reference on merits, the court may examine the preliminary objection of the respondents that reference at the instance of the appellants being beneficiary, is not maintainable. (b) The respondents would be also at liberty to file a reference before the District Judge for enhancement of the compensation. (c) The reference filed by appellants be decided uninfluenced by the fact that the appellants had failed to pass any order under Section 3 of the 1903 Act or that the order dated 02.07.2021 has been passed post the impugned order.
