The police after investigation submitted a charge
sheet for the offences punishable under Section 498 A
read with Section 34 of IPC and Sections 3 and 4 of
2.   The summary of the charge sheet is that
the marriage of Accused No.1 and respondent No.2
was solemnized on 08.10.2009 in accordance with
islamic customs and tradition and thereafter they
resided at the marital home along with other accused.
Out of the said wed-lock, a child by name Rehan was
born on 04.06.2011 in India. Thereafter accused No.1
and respondent No.2 along with the child went to USA
in the month of December-2011. They returned to
India in the year 2016 and during their stay in India,
respondent No.2 was harassed by accused to bring
dowry for the purpose of higher education of accused
No.1 in USA. On 08.02.2017 respondent No.2 went
back to USA along with the child and later on
10.02.2018 she was sent back forcibly to India. On
28.05.2018 she went to the house of accused Nos.2 to
4. At that point of time, the said accused refused to
allow her to enter the house.
3.   Learned Magistrate after taking cognizance
of the aforesaid offences issued summons. Taking
exception of the same, this petition is filed.
4.   Learned counsel for the petitioner submits
that except omnibus and general allegations there is
no specific allegation as against the accused for
having demanded dowry or for having assaulted
respondent No.2. He further submits that marriage of
accused No.1 and respondent No.2 was dissolved on
29.01.2018 by the IOWA Court in USA and also
permanent     alimony   of   $50,000      was  paid to
respondent No.2. Hence, he submits that the charge
sheet filed against the petitioners-accused in the
absence    of  any  essential  ingredients  so   as  to
constitute   the  commission    of aforesaid   offences
alleged against the petitioners-accused is without
5.    Learned counsel appearing for respondent
No.2 submits that the order granting divorce by the
Court of USA is obtained fraudulently without issuing
notice to respondent No.2 and the same has no
binding   on   respondent   No.1.  The   charge   sheet
material clearly discloses commission of the offences
alleged against the accused and the same does not
warrant any interference.
6.    I have examined the submissions of the
learned counsels for the parties.
7.   It   is  undisputed  that respondent No.2
resided with accused No.1 along with child in USA.
The allegation is that respondent No.2 was sent back
to   India   forcibly  on   16.02.2018   without    any
reasonable cause. It is also undisputed that the
marriage of respondent No.2 with accused No.1 was
dissolved by the IOWA Court at USA and permanent
alimony has    been deposited in the bank account of
respondent No.2 which clearly implies that marriage of
accused No.1 with respondent No.2 was dissolved and
the contention of learned counsel for respondent No.2
that the order of divorce was obtained fraudulently
without issuing notice to respondent No.2 cannot be
considered in this petition. Hence, the marriage of
respondent No.2 having been dissolved with accused
No.1, the charge sheet filed against accused is without
any substance. In the absence of any essential
ingredients so as to constitute the commission of
offences alleged against the petitioners-accused, the
charge sheet filed is not sustainable.
8.   Even    otherwise,    except  omnibus     and
general allegations there are no specific allegations as
to how and in what manner each of the accused
subjected respondent No.2 to cruelty or assaulted her.
Hence, the charge sheet filed on the basis of omnibus
and general allegations is also without any substance.
The dispute between the parties arises out of martial
discord, however, given a criminal texture so as to
pressurize   the   petitioners/accused   to   arrive  at
9.   The allegation against accused Nos.2 to 4
subjecting respondent No.2 to cruelty was during her
alleged stay in India in 2017. Respondent No.2
returned to India on 10.02.2018 and the FIR was
lodged    on    30.05.2018     without   offering    any
explanation. Hence, it is implied that the FIR was
lodged against accused Nos.2 to 4 with an ulterior
motive to wreak vengeance and with revengeful
10.  The probability of the conviction of the
petitioners-accused being remote and bleak, it would
be abuse of process of law, if the criminal proceeding
is allowed to be continued against the petitioners-
accused. Accordingly, i pass the following:
1    Criminal petition is allowed.
2.   The      impugned          proceedings    in
C.C.No.1426/2018 pending on the file of Addl. Civil
Judge & JMFC, Bantwal, D.K., is hereby quashed.
