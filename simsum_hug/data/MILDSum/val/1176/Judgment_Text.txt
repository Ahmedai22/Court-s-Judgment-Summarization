Case has been lodged with ulterior motive and mala-fide
intention to harass the applicants. There are only general
allegations against the applicants, hence this Petition.
Per-contra, learned A.G.A. opposed the aforesaid prayer and
submitted that there are specific allegations of demand of
dowry and beating the victim by the applicants. Factual
controversy cannot be settled in this proceeding under Section
Learned counsel for the applicants relied upon the judgement of
Hon'ble Apex Court reported in 1992 AIR (1) page 694
(State of Haryana Vs. Chaudhary Bhajan Lal), para 26 of
Geeta Mehlotra Vs. State of U.P. passed in Criminal Appeal

& para 6 of Hon'ble Jammu & Kashmir and Ladakh High Court
at Srinagar in CRM (M) No. 83 of 2020 vide judgement dated
The authorities relied upon by the learned counsel for the
applicant do not apply to the facts of the present case because
victim, Seema in her statement recorded under Section 161
Cr.P.C., which is at page no. 33 of the paper-book, has
specifically stated that on 5.08.2020, she again went to her
nuptial home with her husband, Ashish. Father-in-law, Gauri
Shankar, mother-in-law, Prem Kumari and two sisters-in-law
beaten her and threatened to pour kerosene oil. She anyhow
escaped from there and came to her father's home. She has
further stated that she came to know that her husband, Ashish
has solemnized another marriage with Deeksha, daughter of
Pahalwan, Resident of Talaur, P.S. Shahjahanpur, District Jhansi
during lockdown.
Learned counsel for the applicant specifically mentioned the
judgement of High Court of Hon'ble Jammu & Kashmir and
Ladakh at Srinagar in CRM (M) No. 83 of 2020 wherein on the
basis of non conducting of preliminary enquiry, F.I.R. relating
to matrimonial dispute was quashed.
Conducting or not conducting preliminary enquiry is the
domain of Investigating Officer on which basis, F.I.R. cannot be

circumspection, as it has been observed, in the rarest of rare case (not to
be confused with the formation in the context of death penalty).
v) While examining an FIR/complaint, quashing of which is sought, the
Court cannot embark upon an enquiry as to the reliability or genuineness
or otherwise of the allegations made in the FIR/complaint;

Following other authorities can be cited on the aforesaid point:

of Haryana and others Vs. Ch. Bhajan Lal and others, AIR
Perusal of the record reveals that an F.I.R. was lodged against
the applicants in Case Crime No. 309 of 2020 under Sections
498A, 323, 506 I.P.C. and Section 3/4 of POCSO Act. I.O. after
collection of evidence and conclusion of investigation,
submitted charge-sheet in the matter, thereafter Chief Judicial
Magistrate, Jhansi took cognizance on 11.10.2021 and
summoned the applicants to face trial.
Whether victim was beaten and harassed by the applicants;
whether there was demand of dowry or not; whether husband,
Ashish solemnized another marriage with another lady named
Deeksha are questions of fact which cannot be adjudicated upon
in this proceeding. Appraisal of evidence is also not permissible
in proceedings under Section 482 Cr.P.C.
In view of the above, I am of the considered opinion that this
Application lacks merit and is liable to be dismissed.
Accordingly, this application under Section 482 Cr.P.C. is
dismissed.
