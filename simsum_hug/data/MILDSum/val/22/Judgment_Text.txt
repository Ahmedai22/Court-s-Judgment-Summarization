the complainant does not have any objection if the FIR against the
petitioners is quashed as she has already settled her claims due to her.
5.      It is to be noted here that apart from usual Sections invoked in
matrimonial disputes, i.e., Section 406/498A/34 IPC, in the present FIR,
Sections 354/377 IPC have also been invoked. Now the matter has been
settled between the parties and this Court has to take a call as to whether the
FIR in question can be quashed. A co-ordinate bench presided over by HMJ
Subramonium Prasad in CRL.M.C. No. 599/2021 tilted ‘Rifakat Ali & Ors
Vs. State & Anr.’ decided on 26.02.2021 has taken the following view on a
quashing petition filed under the similar circumstances:
“The power of the High Courts to quash FIRs while exercising its
powers under Section 482 CrPC even for offences which are not
compoundable under Cr.PC has been settled in a number of
judgments. In Gian Singh v. State of Punjab & Anr. reported as
(2012) 10 SCC 303, the Supreme Court has observed as under:
"61. The position that emerges from the above discussion can be
summarised thus : the power of the High Court in quashing a
criminal proceeding or FIR or complaint in exercise of its inherent
jurisdiction is distinct and different from the power given to a
criminal court for compounding the offences under Section 320 of
the Code. Inherent power is of wide plenitude with no statutory
limitation but it has to be exercised in accord with the guideline
engrafted in such power viz. : (i) to secure the ends of justice, or
(ii) to prevent abuse of the process of any court. In what cases
power to quash the criminal proceeding or complaint or FIR may
be exercised where the offender and the victim have settled their
dispute would depend on the facts and circumstances of each case
and no category can be prescribed. However, before exercise of
such power, the High Court must have due regard to the nature
and gravity of the crime. Heinous and serious offences of mental
depravity or offences like murder, rape, dacoity, etc. cannot be
fittingly quashed even though the victim or victim's family and the
offender have settled the dispute. Such offences are not private in
Signed By:HARIOM      CrlM.C. 1356/2022                                          Page 5 of 10
nature and have a serious impact on society. Similarly, any
compromise between the victim and the offender in relation to the
offences under special statutes like the Prevention of Corruption
Act or the offences committed by public servants while working in
that capacity, etc.; cannot provide for any basis for quashing
criminal proceedings involving such offences. But the criminal
cases having overwhelmingly and predominatingly civil flavour
stand on a different footing for the purposes of quashing,
particularly the offences arising from commercial, financial,
mercantile, civil, partnership or such like transactions or the
offences arising out of matrimony relating to dowry, etc. or the
family disputes where the wrong is basically private or personal in
nature and the parties have resolved their entire dispute. In this
category of cases, the High Court may quash the criminal
proceedings if in its view, because of the compromise between the
offender and the victim, the possibility of conviction is remote and
bleak and continuation of the criminal case would put the accused
to great oppression and prejudice and extreme injustice would be
caused to him by not quashing the criminal case despite full and
complete settlement and compromise with the victim. In other
words, the High Court must consider whether it would be unfair
or contrary to the interest of justice to continue with the criminal
proceeding or continuation of the criminal proceeding would
tantamount to abuse of process of law despite settlement and
compromise between the victim and the wrongdoer and whether to
secure the ends of justice, it is appropriate that the criminal case
is put to an end and if the answer to the above question(s) is in the
affirmative, the High Court shall be well within its jurisdiction to
quash the criminal proceeding."
After relying on Gian Singh (supra), this position has been laid
down in Narinder Singh & Ors. v. State of Punjab & Anr. reported
as (2014) 6 SCC 466, wherein the Supreme Court has observed as
"29.1. Power conferred under Section 482 of the Code is to be
distinguished from the power which lies in the Court to compound
the offences under Section 320 of the Code. No doubt, under
Section 482 of the Code, the High Court has inherent power to
quash the criminal proceedings even in those cases which are not

compoundable, where the parties have settled the matter between
themselves. However, this power is to be exercised sparingly and
with caution.
29.2. When the parties have reached the settlement and on that
basis petition for quashing the criminal proceedings is filed, the
guiding factor in such cases would be to secure: (i) ends of justice,
or (ii) to prevent abuse of the process of any court While exercising
the power the High Court is to form an opinion on either of the
aforesaid two objectives.
29.3. Such a power is not to be exercised in those prosecutions
which involve heinous and serious offences of mental depravity or
offences like murder, rape, dacoity, etc. Such offences are not
private in nature and have a serious impact on society. Similarly,
for the offences alleged to have been committed under special
statute like the Prevention of Corruption Act or the offences
committed by public servants while working in that capacity are not
to be quashed merely on the basis of compromise between the
victim and the offender.
29.4. On the other hand, those criminal cases having
overwhelmingly and predominantly civil character, particularly
those arising out of commercial transactions or arising out of
matrimonial relationship or family disputes should be quashed
when the parties have resolved their entire disputes among
themselves.
29.5. While exercising its powers, the High Court is to examine as
to whether the possibility of conviction is remote and bleak and
continuation of criminal cases would put the accused to great
oppression and prejudice and extreme injustice would be caused to
him by not quashing the criminal cases."
In State of M.P. v. Laxmi Narayan & Ors. reported as (2019) 5
SCC 688, the Supreme Court has observed as under :
"15. Considering the law on the point and the other decisions of this
Court on the point, referred to hereinabove, it is observed and held
15.1. That the power conferred under Section 482 of the Code to
quash the criminal proceedings for the non-compoundable offences
under Section 320 of the Code can be exercised having
Signed By:HARIOM      CrlM.C. 1356/2022                                           Page 7 of 10
overwhelmingly and predominantly the civil character, particularly
those arising out of commercial transactions or arising out of
matrimonial relationship or family disputes and when the parties
have resolved the entire dispute amongst themselves;
15.2. Such power is not to be exercised in those prosecutions which
involved heinous and serious offences of mental depravity or
offences like murder, rape, dacoity, etc. Such offences are not
private in nature and have a serious impact on society;
15.3. Similarly, such power is not to be exercised for the offences
under the special statutes like the Prevention of Corruption Act or
the offences committed by public servants while working in that
capacity are not to be quashed merely on the basis of compromise
between the victim and the offender;"
A perusal of the three judgments show that the Supreme Court has
consistently held that the power under Section 482 CrPC should not
be used for quashing heinous and serious offences of mental
depravity or offences like murder, rape, dacoity etc. since these
offences are not private in nature and have a serious impact in
society. An offence under Section 377 IPC is a henious offence and
points to the mental depravity of the accused and hence ought not to
be quashed by the High Court on the basis of compromise by
exercising its jurisdiction under Section 482 CrPC.
The present case arises out of matrimonial dispute and the
allegation has been made by the wife against the husband. The
parties have decided to part ways and move ahead in their lives
without having any acrimony against each other. In the facts and
circumstances of the case, this Court is inclined to exercise its
powers under Section 482 CrPC even for an offence under Section
377 IPC on the ground that the dispute is private in nature.
The learned counsel for the petitioners has placed reliance on
orders of this Court in CRL.M.C.830/2019 titled as Dinesh Kumar
& Ors. v. State & Anr., CRL.M.C.1613/2019 titled as Anmol Katyal
& Ors. v. State (NCT of Delhi) & Anr., CRL.M.C. 5216/2018 titled
as Gajender Singh & Ors. v. State (NCT of Delhi) & Ors. and
CRL.M.C. 4117/2018 titled as Joginder Singh Bote & Ors. v. NCT
of Delhi & Anr. In all these cases wife has levelled allegations on
the husband committing an offence under Section 377 IPC. This
Court has exercised its jurisdiction under Section 482 CrPC and
Signed By:HARIOM      CrlM.C. 1356/2022                                          Page 8 of 10
has quashed the FIRs on the basis of the compromise entered into
between the husband and wife.
It is made clear that this Court is exercising its powers under
Section 482 CrPC to quash an offence of Section 377 IPC on the
ground that the parties have compromised the matter with each
other only because it arises out of a matrimonial dispute, the
allegation has been levelled by wife against her husband of
committing an offence under Section 377 IPC and the parties have
decided to move ahead in life.”
6.      So, the view of the co-ordinate bench is that in matrimonial cases,
where settlement has taken place, even the offence under Section 377 IPC
can be compromised and FIR can be quashed as parties have to move ahead
in life. I concur with the said view. Keeping in view the fact that parties
have settled all their disputes, hence the offence under Section 354 IPC is
also allowed to be quashed to put an end to all bickerings between the
parties and allow them to begin a new chapter of their lives.
7.      Today, parties are present in the Court and have been identified by the
Investigating Officer. The remaining payment of Rs.8,75,000/- is made by
way of a DD No. 122692 dated 05.05.2022 drawn on Axis Bank in favour of
respondent No. 2. The respondent No.2/complainant states that she has
settled all her matrimonial disputes with the petitioners out of her own free
will, without pressure, coercion or undue influence and states that she does
not want to pursue with the present case any further and requests that the
present FIR and the proceeding emanating therefrom may be quashed.
8.      The parties understand the implication of the present proceedings. In
view of the settlement arrived at between the parties, this Court is of the
opinion that no useful purpose will be served in continuing with the present
proceedings. Resultantly, FIR No.003/2016 for offences under Sections
