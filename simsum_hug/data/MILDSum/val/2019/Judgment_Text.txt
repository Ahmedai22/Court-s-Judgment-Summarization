(2)   The brief facts of the case are such that, on 11.01.2005 claimant –
Rajeen Rafiqahmed Vohra was travelling on Hero Honda motorcycle
bearing registration number GJ-7-AK-6078, as pillion rider and the same
was being driven by present opponent No.2 in the rash and negligent
manner and excessive speed. When they reached near the place of
accident, at that point of time, one Tempo bearing registration No. GJ-15-
X-1352, which was driven by present opponent No.4 rashly and
negligently and in excessive speed, dashed with the Hero Honda
motorcycle. Due to said accident, original claimant has sustained serious
injuries including fracture. Therefore, the claim petition is preferred to get
the compensation of Rs.3 lakhs.
(2.1) The summons were served upon the Opponent Nos.1 and 2 chose
not to remain present before the Tribunal. Opponent No.3 – Insurance
Company appeared through its Advocates and filed written statement at
Exh. 50 and denied the facts of the claim in toto. Opponent Nos. 4 & 5
appeared through their Advocates but have not filed written statement.
(2.3) The Tribunal has framed issues for determination and has recorded
evidence. Affidavit is filed by the claimant at Exh. 41 and claimant has
also produced documentary evidence like copy of F.I.R at Exh.57, copy
of charge-sheet at Exh. 60 and Panchnama of the scene of offense at Exh.
52 and also produced disability certificate at Exh.56. The Insurance
Company and the Advocate for the claimant has filed Pursis at Exh. 44
and agreed to consider the disability up to 10% which was assessed by
the doctor as        8% and accordingly, the Tribunal has considered the
amount of compensation Rs.65,200/- with 7.5% interest p.a. from the date
of claim petition.
(2.4) Therefore, the present appeal by the Insurance Company before
(3)     Learned Advocate Mr. Vrushank Mehta for learned Advocate Mr.
Dakshesh Mehta appearing for the Insurance Company has submitted that
the negligence of the Tempo driver is required to be held as 100% as
charge-sheet is filed against the driver of tempo but the Tribunal has not
considered that aspect. He has submitted that the negligence attributed to
the driver of motorcycle is 20% though it is categorically mentioned in
the FIR at Exh. 57, Panchnama at Exh. 52 and charge-sheet at Exh. 60
that he is more negligent. He has further drawn attention that Insurance
Company of the Tempo was not joined as party, therefore, it may be
presumed that tempo might be uninsured on the date of accident. He has
further submitted that disability, which is considered by the Tribunal to
the tune of 10% body as a whole is also erroneous, therefore, he prays
that present appeal is required to be allowed as the Tribunal has
committed material errors in considering the documentary evidence
available on record while considering the aspect of negligence.
(4)    Per contra, learned Advocate Mr. Amit C Nanavati appearing for
the respondent No.1 and learned Advocate Mr. Ankur Oza appearing for
the respondent Nos. 4 to 5 have submitted that the Tribunal has not
committed any error in considering the amount of compensation nor
committed any error in considering the aspect of negligence in its
judgment. The FIR and Panchnama are considered by the Tribunal in
correct manner and from the discussion, which is reflected from Para 8
of the judgment that the width of the road was 11 feet and it was single
track road with no divider and it appears from the Panchnama that
immediately prior to the accident, none of the driver of the tempo and
motorcycle had applied brakes to avoid accident, therefore, the Tribunal
has rightly considered the negligence part of the tempo driver to the tune
of 80% and negligence of the motorcycle to the tune of 20%. They have
also pointed out that the aspect of income is rightly considered by the
Tribunal and the Tribunal has devoted much space for the discussion of
issue No.3, which pertains to liability of opponent No.3 – Insurance
Company to pay the entire amount of compensation as the claimant is
entitled to recover the amount of compensation from any of the parties.
The Tribunal has given sufficient reasons, moreover, both the learned
Advocates Mr. Oza as well as Mr. Nanavati have submitted that the
amount which is challenged in the present appeal is Rs.65,200/- only and
looking to the smallness of the amount, the appeal is required to be
(5)     I have considered the rival submissions of the parties. I have also
considered the aspect of the negligence from the Panchnama drawn of the
scene of offense. It clearly reveals that none of the drivers had applied
brakes and the road having the width of 11 feet only there is no divider,
therefore, considering the position of the vehicle and also considering the
FIR, the Tribunal has rightly found that the negligence of Tempo is 80%
and negligence of Motorcycle is 20%. Moreover, with regard to the
liability aspect, which is considered by the Tribunal by holding the
Insurance Company to pay the entire amount, is also found just and
proper in the circumstances of the case and more particularly the claimant
is pillion rider and is a third party to both of the vehicles and he can
recover the amount from any of the tortfeasors. Therefore, the direction
given by the Insurance Company to pay the amount jointly and severely
to the claimant is found just and proper. In view of the decision of the
Hon’ble Apex Court in the case of Khenyei versus New Indian
Assurance Co. Ltd., reported in (2015) 9 SCC 273, it would be
open for the Insurance Company to recover 20% of the amount from the
owner of the bike. It is also found that other directions given in Para 12
of the impugned judgment and award is also just and proper and in
accordance with law. Moreover, it is needless to say that Insurance
Company is unnecessarily filing such appeal for the small amount like
Rs.65,200/- in such glaring facts and circumstances of the case.
Therefore, on the smallness of the amount also, the appeal is required to
be dismissed and accordingly.
(6)     For the reasons recorded above, the following order is passed.
(6.1) The present appeal is dismissed, with no order as to costs.
(6.2)     The amount lying in the FDR and/or with the Tribunal with
accrued interest if any, shall be disbursed to the claimant after following
due procedure, by account payee cheque, after verification.
(7)     The record and proceedings be sent back to the concerned Tribunal
