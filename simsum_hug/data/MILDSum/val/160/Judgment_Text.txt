29.    It is averred that Plaintiff was founded in the year 1954 when it
commenced business with one restaurant in Miami, Florida trading under the
name of BURGER KING. Plaintiff is currently the second largest quick
service restaurant hamburger Company in the world, managing and
operating a worldwide chain of over 18,000 quick service restaurants serving
more than 1l million customers daily in approximately 100 countries and
U.S. territories worldwide. Nearly all the Plaintiff’s BURGER KING
restaurants are owned and operated by independent franchisees. Over 30,300
people are employed by Plaintiff or its franchisees.
30.    It is pleaded that Plaintiff’s trademark/name BURGER KING has
been extensively used in relation to Plaintiff’s restaurants and restaurant
services since 1954, in conjunction with a distinctive logo which has
evolved the years, with the latest logo being                . Plaintiff’s trade
mark BURGER KING is a coined mark, being an arbitrary combination of
two unconnected words. It is averred that apart from being Plaintiff’s trade
mark and service mark, BURGER KING is also an integral and conspicuous
Digitally Signed        CS(COMM) 303/2022                                               Page 4 of 12
part of its trading style. Plaintiff, its business, goods and services are readily
recognized merely by reference to 'BURGER KING' as well as its
abbreviation, i.e. the trade mark ‘BK’. Detailed list of the trademarks of
Plaintiff which are valid and subsisting, are mentioned in para 12 of the
plaint.
31.     It is averred that since the launch of its first restaurant in India in the
year 2014, Plaintiff has opened many more BURGER KING restaurants
across India including in Gurgaon, Noida, Mumbai, etc. Plaintiff presently
operates over 250 BURGER KING restaurants in India.
32.      It is pleaded that internet users all over the world, including in India,
have access to the Plaintiff’s website www.burgerking.com, domain name
which was registered as early as on 14.11.1994. Additionally, people from
all over the world including in India access Plaintiff’s website www.bk.com,
domain name, which was registered on 10.07.1998, as well as its India
specific delivery website www.bkdelivery.in (registered in 2015) and have
become acquainted with Plaintiff’s business and services, under the
trademark and trading style BURGER KING, which has further contributed
to the goodwill and reputation of the Plaintiff’s brand. In addition to the
aforementioned websites, Plaintiff also has dedicated websites for different
regions including in India, where the Plaintiff has launched an India specific
website www.burgerking.in. Plaintiff also obtained registration for the
domain name www.burgerkingindia.in on 21.05.2014. Plaintiff holds at least
1040 domain name registrations in its name. Plaintiff’s BK trademark is also
extensively and prominently featured on its website www.burgerking.in.
33.     It is stated in the plaint that sales revenue of the Plaintiff’s BURGER
KING restaurants across the world was USD 23,050 million in the year
Digitally Signed        CS(COMM) 303/2022                                                 Page 5 of 12
2021. Details of worldwide gross system sales are mentioned in para 21 of
the plaint while the expenses incurred on advertisements and promotions by
the Plaintiff are mentioned in para 22 of the plaint.
34.    It is pleaded that Plaintiff’s BURGER KING brand has acquired
excellent reputation and goodwill internationally as well as in India. The
consuming public and members of the trade in India identify, recognize and
exclusively associate the well-known trademarks BK, BURGER KING and
the logos with the Plaintiff, especially in the field of restaurant services.
Plaintiff’s trademarks, having priority in adoption coupled with long and
continuous use and extensive popularity, are entrenched in the minds of the
public including the Indian population.
35.    It is stated in the plaint that in or around March, 2021, Plaintiff
through its Indian Franchisee was informed about the existence of the
website www.burgerkingfranchises.in and the fact that Defendant No. 2 was
duping unsuspecting members of the public into believing that he was a
representative of Burger King India Limited. Defendant No.2 was also
offering the opportunity to operate a café/lounge/restaurant of BURGER
KING. It is averred that Defendants No. l-3 are engaged in registering
misleading domain names incorporating the Plaintiff’s BURGER KING
trademarks and operating fake websites, thereupon inviting the general
public to apply for BURGER KING franchise opportunities. Defendants No.
1-3 are approaching members of the general public as employees of the
Plaintiff’s Indian Franchisee and fraudulently duping people of hundreds of
thousands of rupees by claiming to offer them BURGER KING franchises.
36.    It   is  averred   that  Defendant     No.    l5 represents    unknown
entities/individuals/group of persons who are engaged in registering
Digitally Signed        CS(COMM) 303/2022                                             Page 6 of 12
misleading domain names incorporating the Plaintiff’s BURGER KING
trademarks and operating fake websites, thereupon inviting the general
public to apply for BURGER KING franchise opportunities (Defendants
No.l-3 and Defendant No.15 are hereinafter referred to as ‘main
Defendants’). It is submitted that the main Defendants operate in an
extremely clandestine manner and have not provided their correct address on
their website. In fact, the address provided on the website operated by
Defendant Nos. 1-3 is that of Burger King India Limited (which is the
former name of the Plaintiff’s Indian Franchisee), which is clearly another
attempt to mislead consumers into believing that their activities are
authorized by the Plaintiff. Given the modus operandi of the said Defendants
and since the documents circulated by them over email to various
unsuspecting customers are nearly identical, it is clear that these Defendants
are part of the same entity/organization or may even be the same person.
37.    It is pleaded that in order to gain maximum traffic and establish a
sense of security in its victims regarding the authenticity and genuineness of
their website, main Defendants obtain registration of domain names which
are a variation of words incorporating the Plaintiff’s well known registered
trademark ‘BURGER KING’ and the words franchise or franchises.
Examples of such misleading domain names encountered by the Plaintiff are
www.burgerkingfranchises.co.in         and      www.burgerkingfranchises.in.
Defendants operate multiple active fraudulent websites at any given point of
time,       upon      investigation,     two      domain       names,        i.e.,
www.burgerkingfranchises.in and www.burgerkingfranchises.co.in were
found to be active. Plaintiff apprehends that the main Defendants have now
obtained registrations of new unknown domain name(s) and are continuing
Digitally Signed        CS(COMM) 303/2022                                               Page 7 of 12
their infringing and illegal activities through the same.
38.    It is contended that in order to maintain its pretence of authenticity,
the website prominently displays the Plaintiff’s registered trademarks -
BURGER KING, BK and the Crescent Design Logo. Main Defendants also
used photographs of the Plaintiff’s international restaurants in order to lure
potential victims into applying for a franchisee on their website. It is stated
that   several     photographs     currently   being   used    on   the      website
www.burgerkingfranchises.co.in are the first results found, while conducting
a Google image search using the keywords ‘burger king restaurant’.
39.    It is further averred that the main Defendants are misusing, without
any authorization whatsoever, the Plaintiff’s name, registered trademarks
“BURGER KING”, “BK” and Crescent Design Logo, thereby violating the
Plaintiff’s statutory and common law rights in the trademarks “BURGER
KING”, “BK” and Crescent Design Logo, amounting to infringement,
passing off and dilution of Plaintiff’s registered trademarks. Further, main
Defendants      are   engaged     in  registering   infringing   domain        names
incorporating the trademark BURGER KING and operating fake websites on
such domain name, inviting the general public to apply for BURGER KING
franchise opportunities, collecting monies from them illegally and
frequently, without any permission and authorisation from the Plaintiff and/
or its affiliates. This, it is argued, is also detrimental not only to Plaintiff’s
goodwill and reputation but also to public interest.
40.    Learned counsel for the Plaintiff relies upon an order dated
18.07.2017 passed in HCL Technologies Ltd. & Anr. vs. Ajay Kumar &
Ors. in CS(COMM) 466/2017, order dated 17.08.2020 in MCDONALDS
Corporation and Anr. vs. National Internet Exchange of India and Ors. in
Digitally Signed        CS(COMM) 303/2022                                                 Page 8 of 12

Intermesh Limited vs. Mr. Akash Verma and Ors. in CS(COMM)
255/2020, where directions to freeze bank accounts and disclosure of
particulars of Defendants were passed.
41.     Having heard the learned counsel for the Plaintiff, this Court is of the
view that Plaintiff have made out a prima facie case for grant of ex parte ad-
interim injunction. Balance of convenience lies in favour of the Plaintiff and
they are likely to suffer irreparable harm in case the injunction, as prayed
for, is not granted.
