The petitioner had approached the Regional Passport Officer, Madurai
for renewal of his passport by submitting an application dated 19.04.2022.
The passport authority sought verification report from the police. The police
reported that a criminal case is pending against one Nazirudheen and that the
petitioner's passport was seized in that connection. In view of the said report,
the passport authority did not process the petitioner's application. That led to
the filing of this writ petition.
2.When the matter was taken up for hearing, the learned Government
Advocate appearing for the second respondent submitted that the petitioner
had not come under their adverse notice.            Thiru.Nazirudheen who was
referred to in the police verification report of course figured as an accused in
Crime No.1 of 2019 registered on the file of the Q Branch CID Police, Madurai.
He happened to be the petitioner's travel agent.         Except this relationship,
there was nothing adverse to the petitioner. The second respondent made it
clear that they have no objection for allowing the writ petition.
3.I could have simply noted the stand of the second respondent and
allowed the writ petition as prayed for. But my conscience did not permit me
to leave things at that.       My Lord the Hon'ble Chief Justice had allotted the
General Miscellaneous portfolio which includes the subject of passports.
Crime No.1 of 2019 was registered by Q Branch CID Police, Madurai based on
credible information that one Vaithiyanathan in conspiracy with unknown
public servants and others at Madurai and Trichy fraudulently obtained Indian
passports for many Sri lankan and Indian nationals by using forged
documents. The criminal acts in question had taken place during the period
from 01.02.2019 to 30.06.2019.          The case was registered for the offences
under Sections 120B, 420, 465, 468, 471 of IPC           and Sections 12(1A)(a),
12(1A)(b) and 12(2) of the Passport Act, 1967. I was also informed that a
public interest litigation in WP(MD)No.2563 of 2021 was filed seeking transfer
of investigation to CBI. The Hon'ble Division Bench was however pleased to
direct the Q Branch to complete the investigation within three months. This
time limit was later extended by a period of six months. I felt surprised that
this direction of the Hon'ble Division Bench was not complied with. Final
report was yet to be filed on the ground that sanction had not been obtained
for prosecuting the erring government servants.
4.Judges do not live in vacuum. They are not isolated from the ground
reality. I read in newspapers that Shri.K.Annamalai, the State BJP President
had raised this very same issue in a big way. Almost three years had elapsed
since the first information report was registered. I could not turn a Nelson's
eye. After granting relief to the petitioner by way of an interim direction, I
called upon the second respondent to file a status report. I wanted to know
as to why sanction was not being accorded. Pursuant to the said direction,
the second respondent has filed a detailed status report. It is seen therefrom
that as many as 41 persons are proposed to be prosecuted. This includes the
officials from the Regional Passport Office, Madurai and State police officials.
The Central Government had granted sanction in respect of one of its servants
and declined for 13. The Government of Tamil Nadu has granted sanction for
prosecuting Thiru.Sivakumar, the then Assistant Commissioner of Police,
Intelligence Section, Madurai City. Apart from him, one Inspector and three
Head Constables are also proposed to be prosecuted. The final report is to be
filed shortly before Judicial Magistrate No.IV, Madurai. The learned Magistrate
is directed to scrutinize the same and point out the defects, if any. Once the
defects are pointed out, the investigation officer shall rectify forthwith. The
learned Trial Magistrate shall take a call regarding cognizance expeditiously.
Already several months have elapsed. The case has serious national security
implications.    It is scandalous that one police station in Madurai City has
facilitated fraudulent issuance of as many as 54 passports.        The corrupt
elements must be brought to book at the earliest.
5.The process of police verification in connection with passport
applications is well known. The application is sent to the jurisdictional police
station of the District/City Police where the residence of applicant is located
through the portal for field verification. There are four logins for the police at
•     One for the field enquiry police officer.
•     One for the DSP/ACP (authorised by SP/COP) who acts as the nodal
officer for passport verification.
At the Police Station, login is given to the field enquiry police officer, invariably
a Head Constable of each police station who is nominated by the SHO for
passport field verification. Login is provided for the SHO who accepts the
verification of the field enquiry police officer and submits the status of
verification to the district / city office.
This is done through mPassport Application. The field enquiry police officer
logs in to the app from the Tablet with his login details. In the home page, the
list of Police Verification Requests will be populated and each request is
selected for the verification process. The field enquiry Police officer is now
required to answer few questions on Identity Check and Criminal Background.
The questions that are to be answered by the field enquiry police officer
pertain to the following :
is there any doubt regarding the citizenship of the applicant;
is any criminal case pending;
is any court order against his movement pending and others.
For the query on citizenship, the police invariably depend on the documents
furnished by the applicant and they are documents like birth certificates, 10th
certificate, AADHAAR card, previous passport etc.                Regarding criminal
antecedents, verification is based on CCTNS check. In the fields for the
remarks – Nil adverse or Case particulars are mentioned depending on the
enquiry results. PVR status is selected as Clear or Adverse as the case may be.
The field enquiry police officer uploads his signature and also uploads the
documents that are bought by the applicant during field verification.          This
completes the field verification on the mPassport Police APP by the Field
enquiry police officer.
The next role is that of the SHO who logs in on the passport seva web page
through his log in ID and approves the verification done by the field
enquiry Police officer. This involves his signature being uploaded             and
filling up of the remarks if any. The signature is a picture of the sign made on
a paper and is uploaded through the portal directly. At the District/City level –
2 logins are provided. One login is a general one to view the overall status of
passports verification requests received, verifications completed, pending list
The next login is the one that can be opened only in the designated system
earmarked for passport verification for the district/city to access the portal for
final approval. This can be accessed only by using a particular dongle that is
provided by the passport authority to the district SP/COP, City. The district SP
or city COP nominates one DSP/ACP level officer who on behalf of the district
forwards all the verified applications with any remarks to the passport office.
The verified passports get accumulated at the district login end which is
opened by the nodal DSP/ACP level officer (nominated by the SP/COP)
authorised to do the super check and final approval. The DSP, invariably the
DCRB DSP in Districts and AC IS in cities is entrusted with the dongle that is
required to be inserted in the designated computer while giving a final
approval. However, during the final approval the DSPs enter remarks alone
and they can’t over write the fields already filled by the police station. A Rural
district typically handles somewhere between 150 to 200 passports per day
and is forwarded after verification to the passport office by the Nodal DSP.
The Role played by the field enquiry police officer is the most crucial. The
DSPs/ACPs role is important for creation of new / alteration of IDs of SHO and
Field Police officers as he is the one vested with the power. This role is
delegated to the nodal DSP / ACP by the SP/COP and he is the custodian of
the passport dongle and the designated passport verification system. SPs and
COPs generally review the total number of passports verifications requests
received, verifications completed and verifications pending during the periodic
monthly crime review meetings.
6.One can note that that the buck stops with the nodal officer. The
involvement of the officials above the said rank may not really arise. During
the relevant time, Shri.S.Davidson Devasirvatham, IPS was the Commissioner
of Police, Madurai City.     Had the final report been filed before the public
interest litigation was instituted in the year 2021 ; had the time limit laid
down by the Hon'ble Division Bench been adhered to ; had the sanctioning
authorities accorded sanction without delay, the present controversy would
not have arisen at all. I give a clean chit to Shri.S.Davidson Devasirvatham
IPS. At the same time, I compliment Shri.K.Annamalai, the State Bharatiya
Janata Party President for having taken up the cause. He has played the role
of a watch dog in a democracy. But for him the matter would not have come
to light.
