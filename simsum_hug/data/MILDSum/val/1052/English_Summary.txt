The Delhi High Court has observed that the tendency of filing cases of outraging modesty of a woman under Section 354 and 509 of Indian Penal Code, in the disputes between neighbours to settle scores needs to be curbed.
Justice Swarana Kanta Sharma made the observation while quashing an FIR registered under sec. 354, 452, 506, 509, 354B and 34 of Indian Penal Code.
The complainant had stated that the parties were neighbours and a dispute had arisen over some misunderstanding, pursuant to which cross FIRs were registered. 
The cases were registered in the year 2017 and charges had already been framed. Thus, the Court noted that there was a delay by the parties in coming to the Court for compromise for quashing of the FIRs, thereby consuming much judicial time and time of the investigating agency.
"The tendency to file cases under Sections 354/509 in disputes between neighbours to settle scores is on the rise and needs to be curbed," the Court said, after it was informed by the complainants that they did not want to pursue the matter as the same had been amicably settled. 
While cautioning and counselling the parties, the Court quashed the FIR subject to the accused persons depositing a sum of Rs. 10,000 each in Lawyers' Welfare Fund, Tis Hazari Courts. 
The plea was accordingly disposed of.
