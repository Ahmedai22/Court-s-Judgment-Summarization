3.     The instant petition under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal
Procedure, 1973 has been filed by the petitioner praying for quashing of FIR
bearing No. 26/2017 registered at Police Station Baba Haridas Nagar, Delhi
for offences punishable under Sections 354/452/506/509/354B/34 of the
4.     Notice. Mr. Panna Lal Sharma, learned APP accepts notice on behalf
of the State.
5.     All the petitioners are present before this Court and have been
identified by their counsel Mr E.P. Pandey and Investigating Officer (IO)
ASI Jitender Kumar from Police Station Baba Haridas Nagar, Delhi.
6.     On a query made by this Court, respondent no.2, who is present in
Court and has been identified by the IO, has categorically stated that she has
entered into compromise out of her own free will and without any pressure,
coercion or threat. It is also stated by respondent No.2 that the entire dispute
has been amicably settled between the parties vide Memorandum of
Understanding (MoU)/Settlement Deed dated 21.02.2022 entered into
between them and that she has no objection if the FIR is quashed.
7.     Both the parties have appeared before this Court. The complainant
states that the parties herein are neighbours and a dispute had arisen over
some misunderstanding, pursuant to which the present cross FIRs have been
registered. The cases were registered in the year 2017 and charges have
already been framed. Thus, there has been a delay by the parties in coming
to the Court for compromise for quashing of the FIRs, thereby consuming
much judicial time and time of the investigating agency.
8.     The tendency to file cases under Sections 354/509 in disputes between
neighbours to settle scores is on the rise and needs to be curbed. The
complainants in both the cases are present and state that they do not want to
pursue the matter as the matter has been amicably settled. The parties have
been cautioned and counselled. However, considering that the parties have
amicably settled the dispute out of their own free will, and without any
coercion, it will be in the interest of justice that the FIRs are quashed subject
to the accused persons depositing a sum of Rs. 10,000/- each in Lawyersâ€™
Welfare Fund, Tis Hazari Courts, Delhi and the receipt thereof be filed
before the Registry of this Court within a week.
9.    Accordingly, FIR bearing No. 26/2017, registered at Police Station
Baba Haridas Nagar, Delhi for offences punishable under Sections
354/452/506/509/354B/34 of the IPC and all consequential proceedings
emanating therefrom are quashed.
