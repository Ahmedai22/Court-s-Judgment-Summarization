AGA do not show the compliance of the directions
issued    by this Court in Criminal Misc. Bail
Application No. 46998 of 2020 (Junaid Vs. State of
U.P. and another). Prima facie the police authority has
not only disobeyed the orders passed by this Court in
Junaid (supra) but has also undermined the rights of
the victim. CWC has also not entered appearance before
this Court. Instructions sent by the local police do not
show the compliance of the directions of this Court in
Junaid (supra). The directions issued in Junaid
(supra) are extracted hereinunder:
"A. Functions of local police/SJPU:
I. To inform the CWC about the offence within 24
hours of its registration.
II. To serve the notice of bail application upon the child
and intimate the date of hearing of the bail application

including one Form A and in Form B to the CWC.

There are no instructions with the learned AGA from
the C.W.C. The directions to the CWC in Junaid
(supra) are extracted hereunder:
I. Receive information and documents from the police
and take appropriate action thereupon as provided in the
POCSO Act, 2012 read with POCSO Rules, 2020.
II. To apprise the child of its entitlements under the

This Court finds that in all cases pertaining to the
POCSO Act read with POCSO Rules, the directions
issued by this Court in Junaid (supra) have not been
complied with by the local police as well as the CWC
of the concerned district. Though in all fairness it
appears that Director General of Police, State of U.P.,
has issued specific directions to his forces to comply
with the judgement rendered in Junaid (supra).
However, the directions of the Director General of
Police, State of U.P., are being observed more in
breach. The police is a disciplined force. In case police
officers fail to obey the lawful command of their
superior here like D.G.P., they are liable to be
proceeded against as per law. It is a matter of grave
concern for the Court that the disobedience of orders
passed by this Court in Junaid (supra) has effectively
frustrated the legislative intent of enacting the POCSO
Act read with POCSO Rules.
The Director General of Police, State of U.P., shall file
his personal affidavit in all connected cases regarding
the cause for failure to comply with the directions of
this Court in Junaid (supra) and the action taken
against the concerned officials.
Similarly this Court finds that C.W.C. is not even
represented before this Court. It is not clear whether
CWC has complied with the directions of this Court
and implemented the protection to the victim by
POCSO Act read with POCSO Rules. The learned AGA
has no instructions in the matter.
Government of U.P., shall file a personal affidavit in
this regard. The Principal Secretary, Child Welfare
Department,     Government      of  U.P.,   has   to  take
appropriate action to ensure that the directions of this
Court in Junaid (supra) as well as the legislation made
by the Parliament and the directions of the State
Government through the Principal Secretary, Child
Welfare    Department,     Government     of    U.P.,  are
implemented in letter and spirit by the C.W.Cs. of the
concerned districts. Action taken against the defaulting
C.W.Cs. of the concerned districts, shall also be
disclosed in the affidavit.
Considering the enormity of the problem, the Court has
requested Shri M. C. Chaturvedi, learned Additional
Advocate General to assist the Court. Shri M. C.
Chaturvedi, learned Additional Advocate General for
the State shall take instructions from the Director
General of Police, Government of U.P.; Principal
Secretary, Child Welfare, Department, Government of
U.P., and other other officials and also independently
assist the Court regarding the manner of ensuring
faithful implementation of the POCSO Act read with
POCSO Rules in the State of U.P.
Put up this case on 08.12.2021 in the list of fresh cases.
