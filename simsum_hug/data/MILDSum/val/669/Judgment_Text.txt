Heard finally with the consent of learned Counsel for the
2.           The appellant herein is convicted for the offences punishable
under Section 376(2)(f)(j)(i)(n) of the Indian Penal Code and sentenced
to suffer imprisonment for life and to pay fine of Rs.25,000/- in default
to suffer simple imprisonment for a period of one year.
3.           The prosecution case in brief is as under :
A]           On 02/12/2013, mother of the victim girl had lodged report
at police station Hudkeshwar, Nagpur alleging that victim is her
daughter. Father of the victim is not alive and informant who is the
mother had performed second marriage. The accused Harishchandra
Khanorkar whom she used to treat as her brother. She was working as a
domestic servant in the house of accused.         Her daughter who is the
victim was staying with accused in his family consist of his daughter and
son.     Informant further alleged that after she performed second
marriage, victim continued to stay along with the accused.       Accused
admitted victim in the school and victim is now studying in the 11 th
standard. Before a month victim approached to her at her house on
28/11/2013 and complained about abdominal pain.            She called the
accused and took victim in the hospital. It was revealed that the victim
is pregnant of 7 months. Therefore, she enquired with the victim and
victim disclosed to her that when she was in 9 th standard the accused
forcibly committed sexual intercourse with her. He used to touch her
body. Accused has repeated the act of sexual intercourse with her 3 to 4
times and she had conceived. Subsequently, victim delivered a child.
The child was given to Bal Kalyan Samiti and informant has lodged
report at Hudkeshwar police station on 02/12/2013. On the basis of
said report, police have registered the offence against the accused vide
4.           After registration of the crime, Investigating Officer has
visited the alleged spot of incident and drawn the spot panchnama. He
also collected the blood samples of victim and her child in D.N.A. kit and
the blood samples of the accused in the D.N.A. kit and forwarded to
D.N.A. examination. He also collected the medical report of the victim
and after completion of investigation submitted charge-sheet against the
accused. The learned trial Court has framed the charge vide Exhibit 6.
The learned trial Court has recorded the evidence and found that the
prosecution has proved the charges and convicted the accused and
sentenced as mentioned hereinbefore. Hence, this appeal.
5.           Heard Shri Dhore, learned Counsel for the appellant.
6.           He submitted that the accused is falsely implicated in the
alleged offence. Prosecution has not proved the age of the victim girl.
The victim girl has narrated before the Medical Officer that she was
having love relationship with one person namely Rajan. The pregnancy
might be the result of the said relationship. Considering the same, only
on the basis of DNA evidence accused cannot be held guilty for the
offence punishable under Section 376(2)(f)(j)(i)(n) of the IPC. Whereas
learned Additional Public Prosecutor has submitted that the evidence of
victim girl corroborated by the Medical evidence as well as DNA report
sufficiently shows that it was the accused who committed sexual
intercourse with the victim which resulted into her pregnancy.         The
accused has taken the disadvantage of the circumstances that the victim
girl is not having father, and mother had performed the second
marriage. Hence he is not entitled for any leniency.
7.           Children are the greatest gift of humanity and the sexual
assault on children is the most heinous crime.         To substantiate the
charge, prosecution has examined in all 8 witnesses.
(i)    PW-1 – Victim (Exhibit 59) (due to the mandate of
(ii)   PW-2 – Mother of the victim (Exhibit 64) – informant.
Medical Officer who has examined the victim.
(iv)   PW-4 – Kiran s/o Vasantrao Chougale (Exhibit 77) –
Besides the oral evidence Prosecution also relied upon various
Statement of victim under Section 164 of Cr.P.C. (Exhibit
55), FIR (Exhibit 65), Medical Certificate (Exhibit 68), spot panchnama
(Exhibit78) letter to medical officer (Exhibit 79), letter to C.A. (Exhibit
80), Identification form (Exhibit 82 to 84), Letter to C.A. (Exhibit 85),
Letter to CMO (Exhibit 87), Search and seizure memo (Exhibit 88),
D.N.A. report (Exhibit 92), School Leaving Certificate (Exhibit 111),
School Admission Extract (Exhibit 112), medical certificate of accused
(Exhibit 115), Letter by Dr. Vairagade to Police (Exhibit 117) and
sonography report (Exhibit 118).
8.           As per the prosecution case, victim was minor at the time of
incident and to prove the age of the victim prosecution mainly relied
upon on the evidence of PW-1 – victim and PW-2 – mother of the victim.
PW-1 – victim has narrated her birth date as 27/12/1997. She further
deposed that she was studying in 9th standard when the alleged incident
has taken place. PW-2 – mother of the victim testified that at the time of
incident her daughter was studying in 10 th standard in Dadasaheb
Khadse High School. She further testified that her daughter is residing
at the house of the accused since she was in 6th standard. To prove the
exact age of the victim, prosecution has examined PW-6 – Yuvraj
Prabhakarrao Khadse, Head Master of Dadasaheb Khadse High School,
Nagpur. As per his evidence, victim girl was admitted in his school in 8 th
standard on 25/06/2010 and left the school on 15/06/2013. The birth
date of the victim was recorded in his school on the basis of transfer
certificate of her earlier school by name Swargiya Shrawanji Watkar
Uccha Prathamik Shala, Hudkeshwar Road, Nagpur. He produced on
record transfer certificate copy (Exhibit 110) and School Admission
Extract (Exhibit 111) and extract of the admission register (Exhibit 112).
9.           The accused has challenged the birth date of the victim.
During cross-examination, victim denied that she disclosed her false
birth date. Admittedly, mother of the victim had not stated about the
birth date of the victim.    The material evidence is of PW-6 – Head
Master. It is elicited during cross-examination that he has not enquired
about the correctness of birth date of the victim as it was taken as per
the birth date mentioned in the transfer certificate. It is further elicited
that he had not personally taken the entry. Admittedly, prosecution has
not produced matriculation certificate, or the school record wherein
victim girl was firstly admitted.        The evidence in the nature of
matriculation certificate or the school record wherein she was firstly
admitted is the material evidence.
10.          Learned Counsel for the appellant placed his reliance on
Umesh Chandra Vs. State of Rajasthan AIR 1982 SC 1057, Jarnail Singh
Vs. State of Harayana 2013 ALL MR (Cri) 2946, Mahadeo S/o Kerba
Maske Vs. State of Maharashtra and another (2013) 14 SCC 637.
11.          It is observed by the Hon’ble Apex Court in the case of Jarnail
Singh Vs. State of Harayana 2013 ALL MR (Cri) 2946 that even though
Rule 12 of Juvenile Justice Rules 2007 is strictly applicable only to
determine the age of the child in conflict with law, the aforesaid
statutory provision should be the basis for determining the age, even for
a child who is victim of a crime. For, there is hardly any difference in so
far as the issue of minority is concerned, between a child in conflict with
law, and a child who is victim of crime. Therefore, it would be just and
appropriate to apply Rule 12 of the 2007 Rules to determine the
age of prosecutrix. The manner of determining age conclusively, has
been expressed in Sub-rule 3 of Rule 12.             Under the aforesaid
provision, the age of the child is ascertain by adopting the
first available basis, out of number of options postulated in Rule 12(3).
If, in the scheme of options under Rule 12(3), an option is expressed in
the preceding clause, it has over riding effect over an option expressed in
a subsequent clause. In the scheme of Rule 12(3) matriculation (or
equivalent) certificate of the concerned child is the highest rated option.
In case the said certificate is available, no other evidence can be relied
upon. Only in the absence of the said certificate, Rule 12(3) envisaged
consideration of the date of birth entered, in the school 1 st attended by
the child. In case such an entry of date of birth is available, the date of
birth depicted therein is liable to be treated as final and conclusive and
no other material is to be relied upon. Only in the absence of such entry
Rule 12(3) postulates reliance on the birth certificate issued by
Corporation, Municipal authority or Panchayat.          Yet again, if such
certificate is available then no other material whatsoever is to be taken
into consideration for determining the age of the child concerned, as the
said certificate would conclusively determine the age of the child, it is
only in the absence of any of the aforesaid, the Rule 12(3) postulates the
determination of age of the concerned child, on the basis of medical
12.          Thus, in the present case, prosecution has not proved the age
of the victim by producing relevant documents and evidence on record.
13.          So far as the charge under Section 376(2)(f)(j)(i)(n) of the
IPC is concerned, the implicit reliance placed on record by the
prosecution is on the evidence of PW-1 – victim and the scientific
evidence in the nature of D.N.A. report. The facts on record shows that
the victim is not having father and her mother had performed second
marriage, therefore, she was residing along with the accused. As per the
allegation, accused who is of the age of her father subjected her for
sexual assault forcefully and resultantly, victim girl got pregnant and
delivered a child in a tender age. The evidence of PW-1 – victim reveals
that she was residing along with the accused and used to treat him as
‘Mama’. When initially she started residing with the accused, accused
was residing along with his daughter and son.         After marriage of
daughter of the accused she continued to stay along with the accused.
When she was in a 9th standard the accused forcibly had a sexual
intercourse with her. She further alleged that he used to touch her body
and had physical relations with her on 3 to 4 occasions. She could not
understand that she is pregnant and started vomiting, therefore, accused
took her at Vairagade hospital at Manewada. Dr. Vairagade disclosed to
her that she is carrying the pregnancy of 7 months.       Doctor further
informed to her that if she has to abort the child, expenses are to be
incurred which she could not and, therefore, she had not aborted the
child. In the last week of November, 2013 she delivered a child. Her
mother has lodged the report and child was handed over to the Child
Welfare Committee. She further deposed that after registration of the
crime, her blood samples and blood samples of her child were taken.
During her cross-examination defence was taken that she had a love
relations with one boy namely Rajan but she denied the same. She also
denied that she disclosed before the Medical Officer that she was having
love affair with one boy namely Rajan. Except this cross-examination,
nothing incriminating came on record.
14.          The evidence of PW-2 – mother of the victim girl who lodged
the report is only to the extent that her daughter was residing along with
the accused and she remained pregnant and delivered a male child. Her
daughter disclosed to her that she was subjected for sexual assault,
therefore, she lodged the report which is at Exhibit 65. PW-2 has also
denied that victim is having love affair with one boy Rajan. Except this
cross-examination remaining cross-examination is in the denial form.
15.          To corroborate the version of the victim, prosecution relied
upon the medical evidence and to prove the medical evidence, evidence
of PW-3 – Dr. Mangala Marotrao Sonak was laid. PW-3 – Dr. Managala
Marotrao Sonak testified that the victim was referred to her for medical
examination and she narrated the history that she was in relationship
from last one and half year with one boy Rajan and conceived and
delivered a child on 28/11/2013. On her examination, she found milk
secretion was present in the breast. Uterus was palpable. Accordingly,
she issued the certificate vide Exhibit 68. She also collected the blood
samples of the victim and handed over to the police. During her cross-
examination it is elicited that when the history was given victim was not
under pressure which is admitted by PW-3. PW-7 – Dr. Pratik Sahadeo
Gilbe has examined the accused on 09/12/2013. As per his evidence
accused informed him that incident took place since 2008 to 2013 at his
residential house. He opined that there was nothing to suggest that
accused was incapable of performing sexual intercourse. Accordingly, he
issued the medical certificate. PW-8 – Dr. Sushil Pundalikrao Vairagade
is the medical practitioner who initially examined the victim. As per his
evidence, on 28/11/2013 one girl was brought to his hospital with pain
in abdomen and distension. She was accompanied with man. The man
was under influence of alcohol and was talking irrelevantly. Said man
disclosed that he is maternal uncle of that girl. PW-8 also disclosed the
name of the girl and testified that the girl was in agony and was not able
to walk. On examination she was found to be pregnant and in a labour
pain.     The girl was taken in labour room wherein she delivered
a male child.        The girl seems to be of 10-12 years old.          No
relative was present and the man with the girl was not able to
speak. Therefore, he informed to the police about the incident. Though
PW-8 is cross-examined but nothing incriminating came on record
during the cross-examination. PW-4 - Kiran S/o Vasantrao Chougale is
the Investigating Officer who testified that he obtained the DNA kit from
the forensic lab and forwarded the victim as well as the child for
obtaining the blood samples. He also obtained the blood samples of the
accused in a sealed condition and forwarded the DNA kits to Chemical
Analyzer office along with the letter Exhibit 85 and invoice challan
Exhibit 86. He also received the DNA report which he filed on record
along with the charge-sheet.
16.          The prime evidence on which prosecution relied upon is the
scientific nature in the form of DNA report. Evidence of PW-5 - Amulya
Amol Pande who is the Assistant Chemical Analyzer reveals that he is
expert in analysis of DNA profile as he conducted analysis of DNA profile
in more than 800 cases. He had undergone special training for DNA
profile. The accuracy of DNA results is 100%.         On 05/12/2013, he
received the requisition letter along with the DNA kits. Prior to that
requisition was received for obtaining the DNA kit from Hudkeshwar
police station. On 06/12/2013, the DNA kits containing the samples are
received in the office which were duly sealed along with the forwarding
letter Exhibit 85 with identification forms Exhibit 82 to 84. Accordingly,
16 different tests are performed and the analysis was made by applying
PCR (Polymers Change Reaction) test. As per the said report, victim and
the accused are concluded to be biological parents of baby delivered by
the victim. Said report is at exhibit 92. He specifically stated that the
report is accurate and there is no question of any doubt.
17.          During the cross-examination of DNA analyzer attempt was
made to elicit that he had not obtained any special training.           He
admitted that the person who is M.Sc. (Chemistry) can perform DNA test
and special training is required for DNA test.         PCR is advanced
test/technique.     During cross-examination he narrated entire method
which is applied by him that he examined 16 STR locus in DNA samples.
He personally had extracted DNA from blood samples and extracted the
DNA from blood by Robotic method and prepared the report. It was
suggested that the result of DNA may get affected if the analyst suffering
from cold, fever or other infections which is admitted by PW-5. But he
specifically denied that his condition was not normal when he conducted
the analysis. Thus, the attempt was made that the DNA analysis test is
not 100% sure which is denied by the PW-5. The evidence of PW-5
further reveals that he extracted DNA from blood samples and done its
amplification by PCR method. He obtained electro pherogram by electro
phoresis on genetic analyzer. Thereafter he compared the profile and
lastly prepared the report.       Though arduous cross-examination was
taken, nothing incriminating is brought on record.
18.          After   appreciation  of evidence on record the       entire
prosecution case revolves around the evidence of PW-1 – victim and the
medical evidence and the DNA report. PW-1 – victim has categorically
stated that she was residing at the house of the accused when accused
sexually assaulted her. At the time of framing of the charge, the age of
the accused was 55 years whereas victim girl was 19-20 years old at the
time of her deposition. Thus, the age difference between the victim girl
and the accused is more that 30 years approximately. The evidence of
victim girl specifically states that she was staying with the accused
initially when his daughter was not married.       After the marriage of
daughter of the accused, he subjected her for sexual intercourse due to
which she was pregnant and delivered a male child. It is an admitted
fact that mother of the victim girl was working as a domestic helper at
the house of the accused, and therefore, she got acquaintance with the
accused. Victim girl has lost her father in her early age and mother had
performed second marriage. Due to the second marriage of mother,
victim girl has taken the shelter at the house of the accused and was
calling the accused as ‘Mama’. However, accused had not treated her
like a daughter and subjected her for sexual assault.         Admittedly,
defence has not denied her presence along with the accused at his house.
It is admitted fact that the victim girl was staying with the accused and
she specifically stated that the alleged incident of sexual intercourse by
the accused was forceful and took place after accused had performed the
marriage of his own daughter.        During cross-examination nothing is
elicited to falsify her version.
19.          The evidence of victim girl is corroborated by PW-2 – mother
of the victim to the extent that when victim girl approached to her with a
complaint of abdominal pain, she was pregnant. The implicit reliance
was placed by the prosecution is on the evidence of Medical Officers,
PW-3 – Dr. Mangala Marotrao Sonak and PW-8 Dr. Vairagade. PW-8 –
Dr. Vairagade is the Medical Practitioner who initially examined the
victim whom she approached along with the accused on 28/11/2013
with pain in abdomen. The evidence of PW-8 reflects that the accused
was under the influence of alcohol. No female accompanied the victim.
The victim was in agony and having labour pain. She was pregnant and
within 10-15 minutes she delivered a male child. The evidence of Dr.
Vairagade further shows that the person who brought her at the hospital
left the hospital without informing him, therefore, he informed the
police. As per the evidence of PW-1 – victim, accused is the person who
took her to the hospital of Dr. Vairagade. The defence has not denied
the fact that accused had taken the victim at the hospital of Dr.
Vairagade.      Evidence of PW-3 – Dr. Mangala Sonak shows that on
examination, she found the presence of pregnancy changes. So far as
history narrated to her is concerned it was given by the victim that she is
having some relationship with one boy Rajan. The admitted fact is that
the victim was staying with the accused, accused has taken her in the
hospital and in such circumstances, the possibility of giving false history
to save the accused cannot be ruled out.
20.          The evidence of victim is further corroborated by the evidence
of PW-5 - Amulya Amol Pande who is the Chemical Analyzer conducted
the DNA examination. His evidence shows that he conducted the said
DNA examination by applying the PCR test and on the basis of
examination he opined that the accused and the victim are concluded to
be biological parents of the child delivered by the victim. His evidence
further shows that he received the samples which were in a sealed
condition.      The documents on record shows that on 05/12/2013
requisition was issued for obtaining the DNA kit, immediately on
05/12/2013 DNA kit was handed over. Victim and the accused are
forwarded to the Medical Officer for obtaining their blood samples on
05/12/2013 itself.       The blood samples of newly born baby was also
obtained on 05/12/2013. Exhibits 82 to 84 are the identification forms
prepared by the Medical Officer when victim, baby and accused were
referred for obtaining their blood samples. Immediately on 06/12/2013,
samples are forwarded to Forensic Lab for analysis. PW-5 had analysed
the said samples. During the cross-examination entire procedure carried
out by PW-5 came on record. PW-5 categorically narrated about the said
procedure and nothing is on record to show that the samples were
tampered.      Thus, the evidence of scientific expert is proved by the
prosecution in the present case. PW-7 - Dr. Pratik Sahadeo Gilbe is the
Medical Officer who examined the accused and PW-4 – Kiran Chougale
is the Investigating Officer. The sum and substance of entire evidence
on record shows that victim girl of a young age was subjected for sexual
intercourse and in the result she delivered a child. The accused has not
denied that the victim girl was subjected for sexual intercourse and she
delivered a child. In fact, nothing is brought on record by the accused to
show that he is falsely implicated in the alleged offence.         On the
contrary, evidence of the victim supported by the scientific evidence is
sufficient to show that the victim was subjected for penetrative sexual
assault.     Sexual activities with young girl of immature age have a
traumatic effect on them which persists throughout their life and often
destruct whole personality of the victim. The victim of a sexual assault is
not an accomplish but she is a victim of lust of another person. Her
evidence stands at a higher pedestal than that of an injured witness. The
evidence of victim of rape case is required to receive same weight as it
attached to evidence of an injured witness.
21.          It is also supported by the scientific evidence. There can be
no doubt that there have been remarkable technological advancement in
forensic science and in scientific investigations. The DNA testing has an
unparalleled ability both to exonerate the wrongly convicted and to
identify the guilty. It has the potential to significantly improve both the
criminal justice system and police investigative practices. Modern DNA
testing can provide powerful new evidence unlike anything known
before DNA technology as a part of forensic science and scientific
discipline not provide any guidance to investigation but also supplies the
Court accurate information about the tending features of identification
of criminals.
22.          In Mukesh and another Vs. State (NCT of Delhi) 2017 ALL
MR (Cri) 2448, Hon’ble Apex Court held the importance of DNA
evidence. It was observed in paragraph No.216 and 217 :
“216. In our country also like several other developed and
developing countries, DNA evidence is being increasingly relied
upon by courts. After the amendment in the Criminal Procedure
Code by the insertion of Section 53A by Act 25 of 2005, DNA
profiling has now become a party of the statutory scheme. Section
53A relates to the examination of a person accused of rape by a
medical practitioner.
217. Similarly, under Section 164A inserted by Act 25 of 2005, for
medical examination of the victim of rape, the description of
material taken from the person of the woman for DNA profiling is
must. (Emphasis supplied by us)”
23.          Thus, if totality of circumstances emerging on record discloses
that the victim does not have any motive to falsely implicate the accused
and her evidence corroborated by the medical and scientific evidence
indicate that she had been sexually assaulted by the accused.
24.          Learned Advocate Shri Dhore submitted that the punishment
awarded by the trial Court is the maximum punishment. He submitted
that the accused is of more than 55 years of age. Admittedly, victim was
staying at the house of the accused. Though defence of consent is not
available but the fact remains that prior to lodging of the report she
never complained and continued to stay along with him.                  In the
background that it was the accused who maintained her and brought up
her when her real parents left her on the streets, the punishment
awarded to him is to be reduced.
25.          We have given thoughtful consideration to the submissions
made by the learned Advocate for the appellant.            The Protection of
Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012 is enacted with specific object
that the law should operate in a manner that the best interest and well
being of the child are regarded as paramount importance at every stage,
to    ensure    the   healthy, physical,  emotional,  intellectual, social
development of the child. The object is also that the person of culpable
state of mind should be punished for harassing the child and keep the
society child friendly. From the evidence on record, it reveals that the
accused in the present case is of a 55 years old whereas victim was only
16 years of age at the time of lodging report. As per her evidence, the
first instance of sexual assault on her by the accused when she was in a
9th standard.      The evidence further discloses that the accused had
physical relations with her on 3-4 occasions and resultantly, she was
pregnant and delivered a child at a tender age of 16 years. She had
carried the pregnancy of such a tender age and delivered the child. Due
to the act of the accused who is fatherly figure for her she carried the
said pregnancy. It further reveals from the evidence of PW-8 Dr. Sushil
Pundalikrao Vairagade that the person brought the victim in his hospital
was under the influence of liquor. Victim was in agony and she was not
able to walk. The girl has delivered a child immediately within     10-15
minutes. His evidence further reveals that the person who brought her
in the hospital had left the hospital and never returned again. Thus, the
conduct of the accused shows that he left the victim in the hospital
under the labour pain and not taken care what happens to the victim
thereafter. PW-8 – Dr. Vairagade identified the accused as the same
person who brought her in the hospital and left her there in agony. The
prosecution evidence further discloses that victim girl who has taken the
shelter at the house of the accused as her father is not alive and mother
had performed second marriage. This evidence shows that the trust of
the victim is betrayed by the accused. The accused was under moral
obligation to protect the child in the background that he was having his
own daughter but he destroyed her future life.           The accused had
destroyed the physical body of the victim and degrades the very soul of
helpless girl. It is to be borne in mind that the accused is the person who
has violated the victim’s privacy and personal integrity and also caused
serious psychological as well as physical harm to the victim. Rape is not
merely a physical assault but it is often destructive the whole personality
of the victim, and therefore, the matters of such allegation must be dealt
with utmost sensitivity.
26.          The Hon’ble Apex Court in Ravi S/o Ashok Ghumare Vs. The
State of Maharashtra 2019 ALL MR (Cri) 4873 (S.C.) held that the object
and purpose of determining quantum of sentence has to be ‘society
centric’ without being influenced by a ‘judge’s’ own views, for society is
the biggest stake holder in the administration of criminal justice system.
A civic society has a ‘fundamental’ and ‘human’ right to live free from
any kind of psycho fear, threat, danger or insecurity at the hands of
anti-social elements. The society legitimately expects the Courts to apply
doctrine of proportionality and impose suitable and deterent punishment
that commensurate(s) with the gravity of the offence. It is further held
that the Sentencing Policy, therefore, needs to strike a balance between
the two sides and count upon the twin test of (i) deterrent effect, or (ii)
complete reformation for integration of the offender in civil society. It is
further held by the Hon’ble Apex Court that the criminal law had been
viewed on a dimensional plane wherein the Courts were required to
adjudicate between the accused and the State. The ‘victim’ - the de facto
sufferer of a crime had no say in the adjudicatory process and was made
to sit outside the court as a mute spectator. The ethos of criminal justice
dispensation to prevent and punish ‘crime’ would surreptitiously turn its
back on the ‘victim’ of such crime whose cries went unheard for
centuries in the long corridors of the conventional apparatus. A few
limited rights, including to participate in the trial have now been
bestowed on a ‘victim’ in India by the Act No.5 of 2009 whereby some
pragmatic changes in Cr.P.C. have been made.
27.          Considering the above observation of the Hon’ble Apex Court,
the facts of the present case are examined and it reveals that the small
girl was subjected for sexual assault by the grown up man and imposed
on her motherhood in a very tender age when she was unable to carry
said burden. The subsequent conduct of the accused shows that he left
the victim girl in the hospital under the pain and mental agony and she
delivered the child there without support of anybody. The learned trial
Court had considered all these aspects and rightly come to the
conclusion to award the punishment of life imprisonment. Learned trial
Court has observed that the accused who being in position of trust and
dominance over victim took undue advantage of these circumstances
and committed heinous crime to fulfill his lust. Victim had undergone
tremendous mental trauma by delivering a child. Victim has to lead
remaining life with permanent scar as well as psychological impact on
her life. The trial Court further observed that she is a shelterless child.
It jeopardized future prospects of enjoying life, therefore, such cases
should be dealt with iron hands and maximum punishment needs to be
awarded. Thus, the trial Court has assigned the reasons while awarding
the maximum punishment.
28.          We do not find any reason to interfere with the impugned
judgment even on the point of quantum of sentence.
29.          Considering all these factors no case for acquittal as well as
for lessor punishment is made out. The appeal is devoid of merits. While
dismissing the appeal the question of rehabilitation of a victim as she is
shelterless is to be addressed. Admittedly, father of the victim girl is not
alive, mother is residing along with her second husband and keeping the
victim without any shelter would be again keeping her on the street,
