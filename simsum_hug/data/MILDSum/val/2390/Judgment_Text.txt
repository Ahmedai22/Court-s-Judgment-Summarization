The challenge in the present appeal is to an Order passed by the
National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (NCDRC) on 16th
January 2020, whereby, the Revision filed by the respondent herein
was              allowed   with  direction     to  pay   compensation   as   per  the
guidelines of the State to the respondent.
As per the facts on record, Ms. Baljinder Kaur, respondent No. 2
underwent              tubectomy   procedure   on  23rd   September,  1994  and  27th
February,              1998.  Both   the  procedures    remained   unsuccessful.  The
respondent              gave  birth   to  a   male  child   in  the  year  2003.  The
respondent filed a complaint before the District Consumer Disputes
Redressal Forum alleging medical negligence on account of failed
tubectomy surgery. The same was dismissed on 20th January, 2005 on
the ground that the respondent is not a consumer.                     The said order
was affirmed in an appeal by the State Consumer Disputes Redressal
Commission on 3rd February, 2011. The stand of the appellant is
except nominal registration charges, no amount was to be charged
It was in Revision, the NCDRC set aside the orders passed by the
District Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum and the State Consumer
Disputes Redressal Commission and directed to pay compensation as
per the guidelines and the policy of the State.
Learned Counsel for the appellant relies upon the Judgments of
this Court reported as Indian Medical Association Vs. V.P. Shantha
& Ors., (1995) 6 SCC 651, wherein, this court held that Doctors and
hospitals who render service without any charge    to   every   person
availing  of  the  service  would   not  fall  within  the   ambit  of
'service' under Section 2(1)(o) of the Act. The payment of a token
amount for registration purposes only would not alter the position
in respect of such doctors and hospitals. It was held by this Court
in V.P. Shantah’s case as under:
“43. The other part of exclusionary clause relates
to services    rendered "free of charge". The medical
practitioners,      government    hospitals    /nursing
homes and private hospitals /nursing              homes
(hereinafter called "doctors and hospitals") broadly
fall in three categories:
(i) where services are rendered free of charge to
everybody availing of the said services.
(ii) where charges are required to be          paid  by
everybody availing of the said services.
iii) where charges are required to be paid by
persons   availing of services but certain categories
of persons who cannot afford to pay are rendered
service free of charges.
There is no difficulty in respect of the first two
categories.    Doctors   and   hospitals   who   render
service without any charge    whatsoever    to    every
person availing of the service would not fall within
the ambit of 'service' under Section 2(1)(o) of the
Act. The payment of a token amount for registration
purposes only would not alter the position in
respect of such doctors and hospitals. So far as the
second category is concerned, since the service is
rendered on payment basis to all the persons, they
would clearly fall within the ambit of Section 2(1)
(o) of the Act. The third category of doctors and
hospitals do provide free service to some of the
patients belonging to the poor class but the bulk of
the service is rendered to the patients on payment
basis. The expenses incurred for providing free
service are met out of the income from the service
rendered by such doctors and hospital to paying
patients undoubtedly falls within the ambit of
Section 2(1)(o) of the Act.”
The reliance is placed on the judgment of this court reported as
State of Punjab Vs. Shiv Ram & Ors., (2005) 7 SCC 1 to contend that
the failed tubectomy surgery is not a case of medical negligence as
the sterilized woman can become pregnant due to natural causes.
Once the woman misses the menstrual cycle, it is expected of the
couple to visit the doctor and seek medical advice. This Court held
“28.      The methods of sterilization so far known to
medical science which are most popular and prevalent
are   not   100%   safe    and   secure.   In  spite   of  the
operation     having    been   successfully    performed   and
without any negligence on the part of the surgeon,
the   sterilized     woman   can   become   pregnant   due  to
natural causes. Once the woman misses the menstrual
cycle, it is expected of the couple to visit the
doctor and seek medical advice....................
30.   The cause of action for claiming compensation in
cases   of   failed    sterilization    operation   arises  on
account    of   negligence    of   the  surgeon   and  not  on
account of child birth. Failure due to natural causes
would not provide any ground for claim. It is for the
woman who has conceived the child to go or not to go
for medical termination of pregnancy. Having gathered
the   knowledge     of   conception    in   spite   of  having
undergone sterilization operation, if the couple opts
for bearing the child, it ceases to be an unwanted
child. Compensation for maintenance and upbringing of
such a child cannot be claimed.”
In view of the findings of this Court, the National Commission
has  erred   in  law in  granting  unspecified   compensation   to the
Accordingly, the present appeal is allowed. The order passed by
the NCDRC is set aside. However, if any amount has been paid to the
respondent in terms of the Order of the NCDRC, the same shall not
be recovered by the appellant State.
