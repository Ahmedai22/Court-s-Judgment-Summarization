First petitioner minor child and second petitioner, its
mother are knocking at the doors of Writ Court grieving
against the non-issuance of the Transfer Certificate of the
child, by the 9th Respondent – School despite repeated
2.    After service of notice, the respondents have
entered   appearance    through    their advocates;  official
respondents 1, 2 & 3 are represented by learned AGA; the
fourth respondent is represented by his Panel Counsel;
learned ASG represents respondents 5 to 8; respondents 9
& 10 are represented by their Panel Counsel; similarly, the
now impleaded respondent no.11 is also represented by his
own counsel.
3.    Learned      Panel    Counsel    appearing    for
respondent School & 11th respondent being the father of
the first petitioner & husband of the second, oppose the
writ petition contending that without the consent of the
father TC cannot be issued; the counsel for the school
submits that unless school dues are cleared, the request
for issuance of TC cannot be considered; they also contend
that since the child now in Kolkata is attending the school
online and therefore, there is no reason for shifting it to
another school.
4.    Having heard the learned counsel for the
parties and having perused the petition papers, this Court
is inclined to grant indulgence in the matter as under and
for the following reasons:
(a) The first petitioner is a minor daughter of second
petitioner and, now impleaded 11th respondent happens to
be its father; there appears to be some estrangement
between the spouses as is reflected from the record; the
Division Bench of this Court in father's W.P.(HC) No.
32/2021, has made some observations at paragraphs 10 &
11 of the judgment which show that the custody of the
child is with the second petitioner; that being the position,
the respondent Nos. 9, 10 & 11 are not justified in
opposing    the   request  for   the issuance   of  Transfer
Certificate of the child who is now stated to be admitted to
a school in Kolkata; because of estrangement between the
parents, child’s educational prospects should not be
affected by not issuing the TC.
(b) The contention of counsel for the 11th respondent
that to which school a child of the estranged parents
should be admitted, has to be a matter of consensus
between them and that one of the parents cannot take
such a decision unilaterally, cannot be countenanced as a
thumb rule; child is as yet a minor and it is a female;
admittedly it is in the exclusive custody of 2nd petitioner-
mother; ordinarily, law favours custody of minor daughters
being with the mothers, needs no elaboration; the child is
already admitted to a school in Kolkata; the legal battle for
its custody between the parents is stated to be still going
on.   What is being decided in this case is only the matter
of Transfer Certificate and not the child custody or
visitation rights. Justice of the case warrants the issuance
of Transfer Certificate to facilitate educational career
progression of the child; in matters like this all agencies
involved should co-ordinate and facilitate the same.     This
is reflected in the provisions of Sec.5 of the Right of
Children to free and compulsory Education Act, 2009.
In  the   above  circumstances,   this  writ   petition
succeeds; a Writ of Mandamus issues to the respondents
nos.1, 2 & 3 to cause issuance of Transfer Certificate by
the respondent nos. 9 & 10- School; a direction also issues
to the 10th respondent to hand the subject Transfer
Certificate to the second petitioner-mother within ten days,
failing which the respondents 9 & 10 each shall pay to the
second petitioner Rs.5,000/- for the delay brooked each
day, apart from running the risk of contempt of court.
The   observations   made    hereinabove   shall    not
influence the     claims for child custody or the visitation
