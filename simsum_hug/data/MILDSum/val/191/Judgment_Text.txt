This Criminal Appeal is preferred by the State represented by
the Public Prosecutor to set aside the judgment dated 26.07.2012
passed in SC No.405 of 2011 by the Principal Assistant Sessions
Judge, Warangal, against the respondent – accused acquitting him for
the offences under Sections 448, 354 and 506 IPC .
2. The case of the prosecution in brief was that on 07.08.2009
at 2.30 AM, the complainant, a victim woman, aged about 35 years
came to Subedari Police Station and lodged a report against the
respondent – accused stating that on 06.08.2009 at 11.30 PM the
accused criminally trespassed into her house at Banjara Colony,
Ramnagar, Hanmakonda, outraged her modesty and threatened her
with dire consequences. The complainant stated in the complaint that
her husband died five years ago and she had two children and she was
eking her livelihood by doing coolie work. On 06.08.2009 as usual
she returned home from coolie work at 6.00 PM and after having
dinner she along with her children slept at 9.00 PM. The accused who
was residing in the same locality, who had an evil eye on her,
trespassed into her house when she was in deep sleep at about 11.00
PM, slept on her cot by her side and laid his leg with an intention to
fulfil his lust and tried to outrage her modesty. She raised hue and cry
and tried to catch the accused. In the tussle her blouse was torn. On
her hue and cry, the colony people woke up and tried to catch the
accused. The accused threatened her with dire consequences that if
she reported the matter to anybody or police, he would see her end
and fled away. The colony people tried to catch hold him, but he
managed to escape. Basing on the said report, Crime No.368 of 2009
was registered under Sections 448, 354 and 506 IPC. The accused was
arrested on 10.08.2009 and after completing the investigation police
filed charge sheet against him for the above offences. The case was
taken on file by the IV Additional Judicial Magistrate of First Class,
Warangal and committed to the Sessions Court, Warangal. The same
was made over to the Principal Assistant Sessions Judge, Warangal
for disposal in accordance with law. The Principal Assistant Sessions
Judge framed charges against the accused for the offences under
Sections 448, 354 and 506 IPC. The accused pleaded not guilty and
claimed to be tried. The prosecution got examined PWs.1 to 8 and got
marked Exs.P1 to P5. No defence evidence was adduced by the
respondent – accused. After considering the oral and documentary
evidence on record, the Principal Assistant Sessions Judge, acquitted
the accused on all the counts.
3.   Aggrieved by the said acquittal, the State preferred this
appeal contending that the judgment of the learned Principal Assistant
Sessions Judge, Warangal was contrary to law, weight of evidence
and probabilities of the case. The learned Judge ought to have seen
that the ingredients to constitute the offences punishable under
Section 448, 354 and 506 IPC were made out by the prosecution
against the accused. The learned Judge ought to have seen that the
evidence of PWs.1 to 4, 7 and 8 were corroborating with each other,
the learned Judge had not considered the evidence of the prosecution
witnesses in correct perspective. The reasons assigned in acquitting
the accused were unsustainable and prayed to set aside the judgment
of the trial Court.
4. Heard the learned Assistant Public Prosecutor. Notice was
served on the respondent – accused. But he failed to appear before the
Court and contest the matter.
5. Now, the point for consideration is whether the judgment of
the trial court is sustainable or whether it needs any interference by
6. Perused the record and the evidence of the prosecution
witnesses.    The complainant-victim was examined as PW.1.               She
stated in her evidence that about 2 years 7 months ago while she was
asleep at 11.30 PM she woke up as she found the accused lying beside
her and placed his hand and leg on her and tried to outrage her
modesty, she caught hold him, he had torn her upper garment. She
raised hue and cry. Her neighbours Ramdas and Shanthi rushed to
her. They had seen the accused fleeing away from her house. The
accused gained entry into the house as the door was not bolted from
inside of the house and he tried to commit rape on her. She stated
that, she went to the police station and lodged complaint thereafter,
and identified Ex.P1 as the complaint given by her. In her cross-
examination, she stated that Ex.P1 was scribed by her brother-in-law.
It was suggested to her that there was a pan shop run by one Rajitha
and the accused came to the said pan shop at 9.00 PM for purchase of
cigarettes and a quarrel took place between her and the accused and
she and her brother bet the accused in retaliation, which was denied
by her. When questioned about the age of her children, she stated that
her daughter was 11 years old and her son was 9 years old.
7. A neighbour of PW.1, by name, L. Ramdas, who was cited
as an eye witness to the incident, was examined as PW.2. He stated
that two years ago at 11.30 PM, on hearing the cries of PW.1, he
along with LW.3 Tirupathi (brother-in-law of PW.1) and the brother
of PW.1 rushed to the house of PW.1 and found the accused fleeing
away from the house of PW.1. They chased the accused and tried to
catch him. PW.1 informed them that the accused entered into her
house to outrage her modesty. She lodged a complaint in the said
In his cross examination he stated that his house was situated
three houses after the house of PW.1, the house of PW.1 was a hut
having one room and there was a door to the said house. She was
having a daughter aged 14 years or 15 years old and a son 11 years
old. He admitted that PW.1 made hue and cry, there was every
possibility of her children waking up. He admitted that there was a
pan shop at a distance of 100 yards from the house of PW.1 and he
stated that he did not know whether the accused came to the said pan
shop for the purpose of purchasing the cigarettes and the brother of
PW.1 picked up a quarrel with the accused and PW.1 foisted a false
case against the accused.
8. The brother of PW.1 by name Banoth Bhura was examined
as PW.3. He stated that he was a resident of Pedavangara village.
PW.1 was his sister. She was a widow. He went to the house of
PW.1 from his village. He slept in the shed (paaka) in front of the
house of PW.1. He heard the cries of PW.1 at 11.00 PM, woke up and
rushed to her and found the accused fleeing away from the house of
PW.1. PW.1 informed him that the accused entered into the house
and when she raised hue and cry, he fled away.         He stated that
Tirupathi, Ramdas and Shanta rushed to the house of PW.1 on hearing
the cries of PW.1. He along with PW.1 and others went to the police
station at 2.00 AM and PW.1 lodged the complaint.
He stated in his cross examination that he slept in front of the
house of PW.1 in the court yard, it was during rainy season the
incident took place and on hearing the cries, he woke up and found the
accused fleeing away from the house of PW.1. He chased and caught
hold the accused at his house but the accused escaped and thereafter,
the police arrested him. He stated that LW.3 Tirupathi (brother-in-law
of PW.1) rushed to the house of PW.1 on hearing her cries
immediately and by the time he woke up, the accused was on the way
to his house.
9. Another neighbour of PW.1, by name, P. Shanta, was
examined as PW.4. She stated that about 3 years 6 months ago, at
about 11.00 PM, she heard the cries of PW.1. She along with
Tirupathi, PWs.2 and 3 rushed to the house of PW.1. On enquiry,
PW.1 informed her that accused entered into her house and outraged
her modesty by tearing her blouse and when she raised hue and cry, he
fled away. She stated that she had seen the accused fleeing away from
the house of PW.1 and found the blouse of PW.1 torn.
In her cross-examination she stated that the house of PW.1 was
situated two or three houses after her house. She stated that she had
not seen the accused tearing the blouse of PW.1, she had seen the
accused fleeing away from the house of PW.1 towards his house,
which was situated towards her house.
10.   The panch witnesses for the crime details form were
examined as PWs.5 and 6. Both these witnesses turned hostile and
stated that police obtained their signatures on some papers two years
11.   The Head Constable of Subedari Police Station, who
registered the FIR, was examined as PW.7. He stated that on
07.08.2009 at 2.30 AM, PW.1 came to the police station and lodged
the report. Basing on it, he registered a case in Crime No.368 of 2009
for the offences under Sections 448, 354 and 506 IPC and issued FIR.
He stated that he recorded the statement of PW.1, visited the scene of
offence on the following day morning, drafted the crime detail form in
the presence of mediators and also examined PWs.2, 3, 4 and LW.3
Tirupathi and recorded their statements.
12. The Sub-Inspector of Police of Subedari Police Station,
who investigated the case, arrested the accused and filed charge sheet,
was examined as PW.8. He stated about the investigation conducted
by him and that he arrested the accused on 10.08.2009 at 11.00 AM
and on interrogation, the accused confessed the crime and he
produced him before the Court and after investigation, filed charge
13. LW.3 Tirupathi – the brother-in-law of PW.1 was reported
to have expired as such he could not be examined. PW.4 stated in her
evidence about the expiry of LW.3 Tirupathi.
14. The trial court observing that PW.1 had not stated about
her brother PW.3 rushed to her house on hearing her hue and cry, and
PWs.2 and 4 stated about PW.3 and LW.3 rushing to the house of
PW.1, considered it as inconsistency in the evidence of PWs.1 to 4.
The trial court also observed that PW.3 initially stated about sleeping
in front of the house of PW.1 and subsequently, in his cross
examination shifted his version by stating that he slept in front of the
house in the court yard, also considered it as an inconsistency. The
trial Court also observed that non-examination of the children of
PW.1 was fatal to the prosecution case and considered them as
material witnesses to the case of the prosecution. The trial court also
made an observation that PW.1 stated about not bolting the door of
the house from inside and therefore, accused managed to gain entry
into the house and the said explanation did not appeal to the reason as
she should have bolted the door from inside before going to sleep,
being a widow and having minor children which was not in the
normal state of things. The trial court also observed that there was a
delay of more than 12 hours in lodging the complaint. The trial Court
observed that the incident having taken place at Hanmakonda town
where the police station of Subedari was situated, it was quite possible
for lodging the complaint at least in the early hours of 07.08.2009.
15. The trial Court also pointed out that Ex.P.5 Crime Detail
Form did not show the house of PW.1, but would show the house one
Guguloth Bujji as the scene of offence and it was not the case of the
prosecution that PW.1 was called as Bujji. None of the prosecution
witness including PW.1 stated that Bujji was no other than PW.1.
Thus, the occurrence of the incident at the house of PW.1 itself was
16. PW.1 stated in her evidence on 20.03.2012 that the incident
took place at 11.30 PM about 2 years 7 months ago. As per the FIR,
the complaint was given on 07.08.2009 at 2.30 hours. All the
witnesses also stated about lodging the report immediately in the
police station at the time of the incident itself. The Head Constable
examined as PW.7 also stated that PW.1 lodged the complaint on
07.08.2009 at 2.30 AM. As such there was no delay in lodging the
report. Immediately after the incident that occurred on 06.08.2009 at
11.30 PM on the mid night itself, PW.1 went to the police station
accompanied by other witnesses PWs.2 to 4 and lodged the report.
Thus, the observation of the trial Court that there was a delay in
lodging the report is considered not proper as it was contrary to the
oral and documentary evidence on record.
17. The trial Court also observed that there was delay in
dispatch of the FIR to the Court. But the FIR was received by the IV
Additional Judicial Magistrate, Warangal on 07.08.2009 at 4.00 PM.
The delay of dispatching FIR in the absence of any explanation was
also considered as fatal to the case of the prosecution by the trial
Court. But how the said delay in dispatching FIR to the court was fatal
was not explained by the trial Court. Each and every delay was not
fatal to the prosecution case unless there is a suggestion as to the false
implication of the accused due to the said delay. There was no cross
examination on PW.7 with regard to the delay in dispatch of FIR to
the Court. As such, the said observation of the trial Court is also
considered as improper.
18. Though PWs.5 and 6 – the panch witnesses of crime details
form turned hostile, PW.7 the Head Constable stated in his evidence
that he visited the scene of offence on the following day morning and
drafted the crime detail form. He admitted that the house of Guguloth
Bujji was shown in Ex.P.5 map. But no doubt was expressed by the
defence and no cross examination was made on PW.1 if there was any
doubt as to whether PW.1 was also called as Guguloth Bujji or not. If
PWs.1 and 3 were questioned with regard to the same they would
have explained or answered about it, whether PW.1 was also called as
Bujji or not. When PW.1 stated that the incident took place at her
house, there is no reason to suspect her evidence that the occurrence
of the incident at the house of PW.1 was doubtful by the trial Court.
19. The inconsistencies observed by the trial court were also
not on material facts. PW.3 stated that he slept in the shed (paaka) in
front of the house of PW.1 in his chief examination and in his cross
examination stated that he slept in front of the house of PW.1 in the
court yard during the night time.      This court does not find any
inconsistency in the said evidence.
20. The observation of the trial Court that there was
inconsistency in the evidence of PWs.1 to 4 with regard to PWs.3 and
LW.3 Tirupathi rushing to the house of PW.1 is also not proper as it
was not on a material fact. Who rushed to the house of PW.1 first is
not a material fact to prove the alleged offences under Sections 448,
354 and 506 IPC. PW.1 not stating about her brother and brother-in-
law rushing to the house on her hue and cries is not a material
omission. When the victim stated in clear terms that the accused slept
beside her and placed his hand and leg on her and tore her upper
garment and outraged her modesty and the evidence of the other
independent witnesses like PWs.2 and 4 also supported her evidence
that they found the accused fleeing away from the house of PW.1 and
PW.4 stated that she observed the blouse of PW.1 torn, the trial Court
disbelieving their evidence and acquitting the accused pointing
inconsistencies on some irrelevant facts is highly improper. The trial
court failed to observe that PW.1 was a young widow, a tribal woman
having two minor children, living in a hut and eking her livelihood by
doing labour work. The trial court pointed out that not bolting the
door of the house from inside does not appeal to reason, but failed to
observe that she was living in a hut where there might not be strong
doors and bolts to the house.
21. The observation of the trial court that non-examination of
the children was fatal to the prosecution case also does not appeal to
reason. Children cannot be called to the court and cited as witnesses
unless it is very much essential and there were no other witnesses to
prove the said facts. When there were adult witnesses available, the
victim herself as well as the neighbours and the other persons who can
speak about the incident, the non-examination of children to prove the
incident is considered as not fatal. The trial Court had not given any
cogent reasons for not believing the evidence of the victim PW.1 and
that of the other witnesses PWs.2 to 4.
22.    The accused tried to take a weak defence that some
incident took place at the pan shop in the day time due to which a
false case was foisted by PW.1, but failed to examine any witnesses to
prove the said defence. The prosecution witnesses had not supported
the defence version on the same.
23. Thus, it is considered that the trial Court committed an
error in not considering the evidence of prosecution witnesses in
correct perspective though the evidence of PWs.1 to 4, 7 and 8 were
corroborating with each other, acquitted the accused on some minor
inconsistencies which were not fatal to the prosecution case at all.
The evidence of all the witnesses is cogent, reliable and trustworthy.
Nothing was elicited in the cross-examination of PWs.1 to 4 to
disbelieve their evidence. As such, it is considered fit to set aside the
acquittal of the accused for the offences under Sections 448, 354 and
24. As the evidence of PW.1 is corroborated by the evidence of
the other witnesses PWs.2 to 4 and 7 and 8, to prove the alleged
offences under Sections 448, 354 and 506 IPC against the respondent-
accused, it is considered fit to convict the respondent-accused for the
said offences and sentence him for the said offences.
25. In the result, the Criminal Appeal is allowed setting aside
the judgment dated 26.07.2012 passed in SC No.405 of 2011 by the
Principal Assistant Sessions Judge, Warangal, acquitting the
respondent- accused for the offences under Sections 448, 354 and 506
IPC. The respondent-accused is found guilty of the said offences and
is accordingly convicted and sentenced to undergo rigorous
imprisonment for a term of one year for the offence under Section 448
IPC, to undergo rigorous imprisonment for a term of two years and to
pay a fine of Rs.2,000/- in default, to undergo simple imprisonment
for a period of three months for the offence under Section 354 IPC
and also to undergo rigorous imprisonment for a term of one year for
the offence under Section 506 IPC.        All the sentences shall run
26. The respondent-accused shall surrender before the Court
concerned within fifteen (15) days from the date of receipt of a copy
of this judgment, to serve the sentences inflicted against him under
this judgment and in the event he fails to do so, the Court concerned
shall initiate steps in accordance with law to apprehend and
incarcerate him for the sentence imposed against him. The period of
custody at the time of arrest of the respondent-accused in this case
shall be given set off.
Miscellaneous petitions pending, if any, shall stand closed.
