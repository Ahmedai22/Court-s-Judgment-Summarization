This modification application has been filed praying for
modification of condition no. 3 of the order dated 07.01.2021
passed by this Court exempting the applicant no. 1 from
depositing the passport and further direction to the authority
concerned to release the passport of the applicant no. 1
deposited in pursuance of the aforesaid order of this court.
Learned counsel of the applicants has submitted that the
applicants were enlarged on interim anticipatory bail by the
order dated 07.01.2021 on certain conditions. Condition no. 3
was regarding the deposit of passport before the S.S.P / S.P
concerned. The applicant no. 1 is stated to be lecturer in
Husainabad Government College, Lucknow and is a renowned
Urdu scholar / writer and orator attending National and
International Level Seminars. He is also writer and translator of
several books and invitation for releasing a book at Kuwait in
the first week of May, 2022 has been received by the applicant
no. 1. It has been stated that the applicant no. 1 has been
implicated in this case on account of matrimonial dispute. He
will not absconded if his passport is released by this court.
Learned counsel of the applicants has placed reliance upon the
judgment of the High Court of Punjab and Haryana in the case
of Capt. Anila Bhatia vs. State of Haryana, 2018 0 Supreme
(P & H) 2550, wherein the High Court relying upon number
of judgments of different courts and Hon'ble Supreme Court has
"8. When a person is made to surrender his passport, it curtails his right
of movement beyond the country. Article 21of the Constitution of India
" No person shall be deprived of his life or personal liberty except
according to procedure established by law."
9. The expression "personal liberty" is of the widest amplitude and it
covers a variety of rights which go to constitute the personal liberty of a
person. The Supreme Court, in Satwant Singh v. Asst. Passport Officer
[(1967) 3 SCR 525] held that "personal liberty" guaranteed under Article
21 Crl. M.C. No.1734 of 2011 encompassed a right of locomotion, of the
right to travel abroad. Every person living in India has a fundamental
right to travel, even outside India. Refusal by the Government to issue a
passport without a valid law prescribing reasonable restrictions was held
to be an arbitrary exercise of the executive power infringing the equality
clause of the Constitution. After the decision in Satwant Singh's case the
Parliament passed the Passport Act, 1967 regulating conditions for the
grant and refusal of passport and providing grounds for impounding
passport. Even after passing of the said Act, in Maneka Gandhi v. Union
of India [(1978) 1 SCC 248] the Supreme Court held that the right to
travel abroad is not only 5 of 14 encompassed in the right to liberty
under Article 21 of the Constitution, but that right could only be denied if
the procedural law which governed its excuse is fair.
10. The preamble to the Act says that it is, "to provide for the issue of
passports and travel Crl. M.C. No.1734 of 2011 documents, to regulate
the departure from India of citizens of India and other persons and for
matters incidental ancillary thereto." Section 10(3) of the Act empowers
the passport authority to "impound or cause to be impounded or revoke a
passport or travel document" in the circumstances stated therein. Thus,
power to impound a passport is given to the passport authority under the
11. The Supreme Court in Suresh Nanda's case (supra) was not
considering the power of criminal court to direct a person accused or
suspected of commission of a non cognizable offence while he is released
on bail to surrender his passport in court to ensure his presence at the
investigation, enquiry or trial of the case. Instead, the Supreme Court was
only considering the scope and ambit of Section 104 of the Code which
" Any court may, it thinks fit, impound any document or thing produced
before it" under the code. The power under Section 104 of the Code could
be exercised Crl. M.C. No.1734 of 2011 only with respect to a document
produced before the court and not, regarding a document not produced
before it. In Wharton's Law Lexicon, the word "impound" is given the
meaning, "to place in the custody of the law". Per Oxford Dictionary the
word means "to 6 of 14 take legal or formal possession of". In Suresh
Nanda's case (supra), the Supreme Court considered the distinction
between "seizing" and "impounding" and held that impounding is of the
document which is seized. It was held that after enactment of the Act
which is a special Act, a passport seized (by the CBI in that case) could be
impounded only under Sec.10(3) of the Act and that so far as Sec. 104 of
the Code is concerned to the extent it related to documents coming under
Sec. 10 (3) of the Act, the maxim, 'generalia specialibus non derogant'
applied. In that case the officials of the CBI conducted a search and seized
the passport of appellant. That document was retained by the CBI.
Appellant moved the court of Special Judge to release the passport. The
Special Judge Crl. M.C. No.1734 of 2011 allowed the application. That
order was set aside by the High Court in revision. The Supreme Court set
aside the order of the High Court on the principle above stated. Suresh
Nanda was not a case of the criminal court imposing a condition while
granting bail in a non bailable offence to surrender the passport. The
Supreme Court was not considering the power of criminal court in view of
Sec. 10(3) of the Act, to impose a condition to surrender the passport
while granting bail in a non bailable offence. Instead, that question was
left open as is clear from the observation in paragraph 20 (of Suresh
"We, however, make it clear that we are not expressing any opinion on the
merit of the case and are not deciding whether the passport can be
impounded as condition for 7 of 14the grant of bail."
12. The Chhattisgarh High Court in Pushpal Swarnkar v. State of
Chhattisgarh 2009(1) KLD 825 (Chh.) only made reference to the
observations in paragraph 15 of the decision in Suresh Nanda regarding
the power of criminal court to impound the passport under Sec. 104 of the
Code which observation, I stated above is made in an entirely different
Pushpal Swarnkar's case did not consider, in view of the observation in
paragraph 20 of Suresh Nanda quoted above whether the criminal court
can, while releasing a person accused or suspected of commission of a
non bailable offence to impose a condition to surrender the passport.
13. The decision in Jose Peter v. Vijayakumar 2009(3) KLT 96 also cannot
help petitioner in his contention. There, the question considered and
decided was only whether a civil court, in execution of a decree could,
invoking Sec. 151 of the Code of Civil Procedure impound passport of a
judgment debtor on the ground that he is likely to leave the country. The
question was answered in the negative.
14. Even after enactment of the Act, in view of Article 21 of the
Constitution as explained in Maneka Gandhi's case (supra) the right to
travel abroad is encompassed in the right to personal liberty which cannot
be deprived except in accordance with the procedure established by the
law. The right to travel abroad can be deprived by following procedure
established by the law. Sec. 437(3) of the Coderequires and enables the
criminal court while releasing a person accused or suspected of
commission of a non bailable offence by imposing a condition that such
person shall attend in accordance with the conditions of the bond
executed under chapter 8 of 14 XXXIII of the Code. Even in the matter of
non bailable offences not falling within sub sec.(3) of Sec. 437 of the
Code, the Magistrate or court has the discretionary power to impose
condition while granting bail.The person to whom bail is granted has to
execute a bond in Form No.45 given in the second schedule of the Code.
The relevant provision of the bond in Form No.45 states." ...... and
required to give security for any attendance before such officer or court
on condition that I shall attend such officer or court on every day on
which any investigation or trial is held with regard to such Crl. M.C.
No.1734 of 2011 charge, and in case of my making default therein......"
15. The function of the criminal court under Sec. 437 of the Code is not
merely to impose a condition in the bond that the person accused or
suspected of commission of a non bailable offence and to whom bail is
granted attended before the officer or court. The court has to ensure that
the condition is complied. The court has to enforce it. The court has to
ensure that the accused who is released on bail and who has a passport
does not flee from justice. The "majesty of the law is affected when a
wrong doer escapes its mighty clutches-whether arising out of a voluntary
or involuntary situation." The court has to preserve the majesty of the law.
That could be done, in the case of a person holding a valid passport by
directing him to surrender the same in court. That the passport authority
may, if proceeding in respect of an offence alleged to have Crl. M.C.
No.1734 of 2011 been committed by the holder of the passport or travel
document are pending before a criminal court in India impound or cause
to be impounded or revoked such document under Sec.10(3)(e) of the Act
9 of 14 does not deprive the power and duty of the criminal court to
enforce its order by appropriate direction. The Supreme Court in
Hazarilal Gupta v.Rameswar Prasad and another [AIR 1972 SC 484] has
held that sections 496, 497 and 498 of the (old) Code are not exhaustive of
powers of the court in regard to terms and conditions of bail particularly
when the High Court dealt with cases of that type, it was within the power
of court to direct surrender of passport and that if the appellant (in that
case) wanted to retain the passport the court might not have granted him
bail. Viewed in that line, I am to hold that it is within the power of the
criminal court while releasing a person accused or suspected of
commission of a non bailable offence on bail under Sec. 437 of the
Code to impose a condition that such person shall Crl. M.C. No.1734 of
2011 surrender his passport in court. The power granted bythe
Code under Sec. 437 of the Code to impose conditions including
restriction on movement while granting bail in non bailable offence can
be taken as procedure established by law as stated in Article 21 of the
Constitution. In that view, with great respect I disagree with the view
expressed in Pushpal Swarnkar's case.
16. But the criminal courts have to take extreme care in imposing such
condition. It cannot mechanically, and in every case where an accused has
a passport impose a condition for its surrender. Law presumes an accused
to be innocent till he is declared guilty. As a presumably innocent person
he is entitled to all the fundamental rights guaranteed to him under the
Constitution. At the same time, interest of the society has also to be
protected. The court has to strike a balance between personal liberty of
the accused guaranteed under Article 21 of the Constitution, investigation
10 of 14 rights of the police and the interest of the Crl.M.C. No.1734 of
2011 society. The criminal court has to consider possibility of the accused
if released on bail, fleeing justice and thereby thwarting the course of
justice which affects the majesty of the law, as also the individual rights of
the accused. The court has to consider antecedents of the person accused
or suspected of commission of the offence, nature of the offence he is said
to have committed, necessity for his presence for investigation, duration of
investigation and such other relevant factors. The court has to decide
whether notwithstanding the personal liberty of the accused, interest of
justice required that his right of movement should be restricted during the
pendency of the case by directing him to surrender his passport. If
necessary, it is open to the criminal court direct the accused to execute
bond in case he has to go abroad for any purpose, for appropriate amount
with sureties undertaking to appear before the Investigating Officer or
court as the case may be as and when required to do so. These are though
not Crl. M.C. No.1734 of 2011 exhaustive, some of the matters to be borne
in mind by the court while deciding whether there should be a condition to
surrender the passport or when there is a request to release the passport
already surrendered in court."
A perusal of the aforesaid judgment shows that the condition of
deposit of passport may be onerous in the case of applicant no.
1, hence considering the arguments of the counsel for the
applicant no. 1 and material brought on record and for the
reasons given hereinabove by the courts, the present application
is allowed and the condition no. 3 of the interim bail application
is hereby modified and deleted. The authority with whom the
applicant no. 1 has deposited his passport shall release the same
provided applicant no. 1 moves an application supported by
his affidavit along with proof that he is still required to go
abroad on some future date and in case passport is released in
his favour he will not misuse the liberty granted to him and will
appear before the trial court as and when required.
The modification application is allowed.
