District Pali. It is mentioned in the application that out of the said

(2 of 4)           [CW-6794/2022]
the application that though the petitioner and the respondent lived
together as husband and wife for quite some time, but later on
differences cropped ups between the parties and both of them
started living separately from July, 2018 and now it is not possible
for them to live together as husband and wife. It has specifically
been mentioned in the application under Section 13-B of the Act of
1955, duly supported by an affidavit of both the parties that both
of them are living separately from July, 2018 and since then, there
is no relation between them. It is also mentioned in the
application that the petitioner has already paid alimony amount to
the respondent and it is agreed by the respondent that she will
not claim any further amount from the petitioner in future.
The application under Section 13-B of the Act of 1955 was
filed before the court below on 19.02.2022 and the next date in
the matter is fixed on 20.08.2022.
A joint application was filed by the parties before the court
below for waving six months’ cooling-off period as provided under
Section 13-B of the Act of 1955 on 26.04.2022, however, the court
below has rejected the same while observing that the parties have
failed to produce documents to prove the fact that both of them
are living separately since July, 2018.
Learned counsels for the parties have submitted that both
the petitioner and the respondent have stated on oath through
affidavit that they are living separately since July, 2018 and, in
such circumstances, there no requirement of producing any
documentary evidence to prove the aforesaid fact.
Learned counsels for the parties have also placed reliance on
the decision of the Hon’ble Supreme Court rendered in the case of
(3 of 4)             [CW-6794/2022]
Amardeep Singh Vs. Harveen Kaur, reported in (2017) 8 SCC
Heard learned counsel for the parties and perused the
impugned order.
The Hon’ble Supreme Court in Amardeep Singh’s case
(supra) has held as under :
“19. Applying the above to the present situation,
we are of the view that where the Court dealing
with a matter is satisfied that a case is made out
to waive the statutory period under Section 13-
B(2), it can do so after considering the following:
i) the statutory period of six months specified in
Section 13-B(2), in addition to the statutory
period of one year under Section 13-B(1) of
separation of parties is already over before the
first motion itself;
ii) all efforts for mediation/conciliation including
efforts in terms of Order 32-A Rule 3 CPC/Section
23(2) of the Act/Section 9 of the Family Courts
Act to reunite the parties have failed and there is
no likelihood of success in that direction by any
further efforts;
iii) the parties have genuinely settled their
differences including alimony, custody of child or
any other pending issues between the parties;
iv) the      waiting   period   will   only   prolong  their
agony.
The waiver application can be filed one week after
the first motion giving reasons for the prayer for
waiver. If the above conditions are satisfied, the
waiver of the waiting period for the second motion
will be in the discretion of the court concerned.
20. Since we are of the view that the period
mentioned in Section 13-B(2) is not mandatory
but directory, it will be open to the Court to
exercise     its    discretion    in     the   facts   and
circumstances of each case where there is no
possibility of parties resuming cohabitation and
there are chances of alternative rehabilitation.”
(4 of 4)             [CW-6794/2022]
In the present case, when the parties have already stated on
oath through affidavit that both of them are living separately since
July, 2018, the court below has committed illegality in rejecting

of the case, this writ petition is allowed. The impugned order
dated 26.04.2022 passed by the court below rejecting the
application filed on behalf of the parties for waiving cooling-off six
months’ period is hereby set aside and the statutory period of six
months specified under Section 13-B(2) of the Act of 1955 is
hereby waived.
The parties are directed to appear before the court below on
24.05.2022 and the court below is directed to pass decree of
