Government     Pleader   for  respondent    No.1   and   Sri

No.2/defacto complainant.
2.     The present petition is filed under Section
482 of Cr.P.C., with the following prayer:
“WHEREFORE,      it  is   most   humbly
prayed, Hon'be court by exercise of power
U/s.482 Cr.P.C. be pleased to quash the
taking    cognizance   dated    01-10-2021   in
Netaji Nagar P.S., Raichur) for the offence
punishable U/sec. 420, 409, 120(B) of IPC,
pending before the ADDL CIVIL JUDGE &
JMFC-III    Court   at  Raichur,   against the
petitioners, in the interest of justice and
equity.”
3.     Brief facts which are necessary for disposal
of the present petition are as under:
Shridhar R. Banare S/o Ramdas O. Banare lodged
a complaint with Netajinagar Police Station, Raichur
District, on 01.10.2018 which was registered in Crime
No.110/2018 for the offence punishable under Section
420 r/w Section 34 of IPC against Girish Ramdas Banare
and Manager of Pragati Krishna Grameen Bank.
Gist of the complaint averments reveal that the
mother of the complainant by name Smt. Kamala had an
Account with Pragati Krishna Grameen Bank and she
also had the services of a safe locker in the joint names
of the complainant and herself, at the first instance. In
the said locker, 45 tola of gold rings and 65 tolas of gold
ornaments were kept.       So also, the original Will and
other documents pertaining to immovable properties
were    kept   in the   said  locker.    On   19.10.2015,
Smt. Kamala, who is the mother of the complainant died
and on 24.05.2016, the complainant gave an application
to the Bank Manager stating that the locker was to be
operated in the joint names of the complainant and Smt.
Kamala. Since Smt. Kamala is no more, he alone be
permitted to operate the safe locker which was obtained
by his mother.    To his surprise, he came to know that
the safe locker operations were made in the name of
first accused who is his elder brother and Smt. Kamala
by giving a necessary written mandate.      Therefore, his
request was turned down by the Manager.            As such,
complainant sought for action against his brother and
bank officials.
4.    The   Police  after   registering   the    case,
investigated the matter and filed chargesheet against
the petitioners herein as well as the elder brother of the
5.    The petitioners being the Manager of Pragati
Krishna Grameen Bank and retired Chief Manager of
Karnataka     Grameen    Bank,    have    challenged     the
chargesheet on the following grounds:
•     “That the petitioners are innocent of
the alleged offences against them and
they are falsely involved in the above
case.
•     That,   the   petitioners   are    falsely
involved by respondent and there are
no other evidences to state that the
petitioners are involved in the above
said offences, which is bad in law.
• That, the petitioner No.1 joined the
services of the Bank as Probationary
officer (Manager-Scale-II) and posted
to   Koppal   branch    on   09/02/2012.
Thereafter he has been transferred to
work at Jawahar nagar Branch and
from    15-05-2012      to    15-08-2014
worked at the Branch and discharged
his duties as second line officer.
• That, on 31/05/2014 petitioner No.1
was neither 1st key holder or a 2nd key
holder therefore he was not aware of
any operations of Locker No.66 on
31/05/2014. There were also other 2nd
line officers who were looking after
such duties. That, the officers who
were authorized for operation of the
Bank lockers are A-1 & A-4. The copy
of the duty chart is enclosed herewith.
• That, petitioner No.2 was working as
Branch Manager at Jawarhar Nagar
Branch, Raichur from 18/05/2012 to
20/05/2014. Thus, no culpability can
be fastned against the petitioner No.2
as the entire incident of misusing of the
locker    pertain   to    specifically on
• That, it is pertinent to mention that the
petitioner was transferred from the
Jawahar     Nagar   Branch    Raichur  to
Regional    Manager    on   promotion  as
senior Manager who took the charge
on 21/05/2014. Thus, an act which is
unconnected to the petitioner can be
forced to face the ordered of criminal
trial. The copy of his duty chart is
enclosed.
• The safe deposit locker agreement can
be terminated by neither party on
giving to the other, 7 days notice in
writing of such intention and the keys
of the locker shall in that event be
delivered by the hirer to the Bank at
noon on the day of expiry of the notice
(not withstanding that the period for
which the locker as rented shall not
have expired). Upon the       locker being
vacated        and         the        keys
surrendered pursuant to the notice by
the hirer, the bank shall return the
proportionate    charges    (if   paid   in
advance) for the unexpired period of
lease treating part of the quarter as full
for the purpose of calculating rent
payable to the Bank.
• In   case   of  joint   hires   were   the
operational condition is several, the
notice of termination and surrender of
keys by one or more of them shall be
construed to have been made under
the express authorization of other/s of
the hirers and the notice of termination
so given and surrender of key by one
or    more     of     them      shall   be
notice and surrender of keys as if it is
from all the joint hires for all purposes
and intents.
• It is submitted that on a bare perusal
of FIR and Charge-sheet papers, there
is not even an allegation let alone
prima-facie material as against the
petitioner   under   any  of   the   penal
provisions enumerated in the charge
sheet. Hence, the criminal proceedings
as    against    the    petitioners     are
maliciously launched vexatious,     illegal
and unsustainable in law.
• That, even as per the prosecution case
itself in the charge sheet their no
material averred     to make out       any
material of the involvement of the
petitioners.
• That, there is absolutely no cogent or
reliable   materials   to   connect     the
petitioners to this case based on the
materials collected by the police as per
the charge sheet and thus the above
proceeding has resulted in gross abuse
of the process of the court and hence
the same has to be quashed.
• Thus, looking towards the chain of
circumstances,     the  allegation   made
prima facie no material is there in the
case,   initiated   and   continuation  of
criminal   proceeding    is  nothing   but
abuse of process of law.
• That, if the present petition is not
allowed      then    there    would     be
continuation of misuse of the provisions
of   law     and   harassment     to   the
petitioner. Hence proceeding with the
case will not served the purpose of any
body.
• No other case has been filed or pending
before this Hon'ble High Court or any
other court seeking the relief sought in
the petition.
• The petitioner craves leaves to urge
any other points that may be available
at the time of arguments.”
6.    Learned    counsel   for   the    petitioners
reiterating the grounds urged in the petition vehemently
contended that admittedly there was a safe locker
facility in Krishna Grameen Bank in the name of Smt.
Kamala who is the mother of the complainant and the
first accused.    He further contended that initially the
safe locker was being operated in the joint names of the
complainant and mother and subsequently, the mother
has given necessary instructions to the Bank in writing
whereby the joint operation of the safe locker was
modified and it was being operated by the first accused
and Smt. Kamala. Petitioners being Managers of the
Bank, they were required to adhere to the instructions of
the    customer    and  accordingly,  they   have    made
necessary modification in their records and permitted
the first accused and Smt. Kamala to operate the safe
7.   After  the    death  of   Smt.  Kamala,    the
complainant gave a letter for operation of the safe
locker which was in the name of Smt. Kamala and was
to  be    operated  jointly   by Smt.   Kamala   and   the
complainant. The said letter could not be processed in
view of the subsequent mandate received from the
customer namely Smt. Kamala earlier to her death on
8.   Therefore,    there  is   no   criminality   in
petitioners permitting the first accused to operate the
locker. He also contended that if there is any misuse of
the articles found in the safe locker, it is the first
accused who is responsible for the same and the
Managers have no hand of whatsoever with the alleged
misuse of the articles, inasmuch as, the mandate has
been        received        on      27.11.2013       when
Smt. Kamala was very much alive.
9.   He further argued that if at all, the first
accused has committed any fraud on his mother Smt.
Kamala, the same needs to be decided by the learned
Trial Judge in the pending criminal case and absolutely,
these two petitioners have no hand in the same and
sought for quashing of further proceedings.
10.  Per contra, learned High Court Government
Pleader appearing for respondent No.1 and learned
counsel for respondent No.2/defacto complainant in
chorus contended that the petitioners being Managers
have been found fault by the Ombudsman and they
have been warned as to their illegalities in allowing the
first accused to operate the safe locker which prima
facie shows that the Managers were also involved and
they have colluded with the first accused in the alleged
misuse of the articles found in the locker and therefore,
sought for dismissal of the petition.
11.  This Court perused the material on record
meticulously in view of the rival contentions of the
12.  On such perusal, it is evident that at an
undisputed point of time, Smt. Kamala who is the
mother of the first accused and the complainant opened
an Account in Pragati Krishna Grameen Bank.
13.  She also availed the facility of the locker to
keep     her  precious  ornaments   and    the  documents
pertaining to the immovable properties. The locker was
initially being operated in the joint names of the
complainant and Smt. Kamala. However, by issuing a
letter    on   27.11.2013,    Smt.   Kamala     wanted    a
modification in the joint operation of the locker whereby,
name of the complainant was removed and in that place,
she wanted the joint operation of the locker by herself
and the first accused. Admittedly, on 27.11.2013, there
was no differences between the complainant and the
first accused.
14.  Being the Managers of the Bank, under the
Banking rules, the petitioners were bound to adhere to
the mandate issued by the customer. Accordingly, they
did not suspect any foul play in the letter dated
27.11.2013 and modified the joint operation of the safe
locker which was standing in the name of Smt. Kamala.
15.  Subsequently, on 19.10.2015, Smt. Kamala
passed away. But, the complainant visited the Bank on
24.05.2016 with a request to permit him to operate the
locker by himself as Smt. Kamala was no more, as
earlier he was also permitted to operate the locker along
with Smt. Kamala jointly or severally. The said request
was turned down by the Managers on the ground that
there    was   a   modification  through   letter   dated
27.11.2013 and therefore, the criminal complaint came
to be lodged.
16.    As it could be seen from the material on
record, the dispute is only between the complainant and
the first accused and for which unnecessarily the
Managers of the Pragati Krishna Grameen Bank who are
the petitioners herein have been arraigned as additional
accused by making a vague allegation of collusion.
17.    Further,    the     complainant     has    also
approached the Ombudsman. The Ombudsman has
noted certain irregularities and warned the petitioners to
be careful in future while dealing with similar situation.
There is a thin line of difference between the irregularity
and illegality. However, the said thin line is subtle. Every
irregularity would not per se amount to illegality.
18.    For the purpose of invoking Section 420 of
IPC, there must be existence of a wrongful loss and
wrongful gain by the alleged action.
19.  In the case on hand, neither the complaint
nor the charge sheet material makes out a case that the
petitioners are the beneficiaries of the wrongful gain.
Nor any wrongful loss has occurred to the complainant
by an act which is attributable to the petitioners herein.
To make out a case under Section 420 of IPC, wrongful
loss occurred to the complainant and wrongful gain
made by the accused persons is a sine qua non. In the
case on hand, petitioners have simply adhered to the
mandate issued by the accountholder Smt. Kamala on
27.11.2013 as dutiful bank officials.
20.  Merely  acting   on   the  mandate     of the
customer, no intentions of criminality can be attributed
so as to proceed against the petitioners in the trial.
When such requisite material is not available on record
and in the charge sheet materials, this Court is of the
considered opinion that continuation of the criminal
proceedings as against the petitioners herein would
definitely result in abuse of process of law.
21.    However, the case against the first accused
would continue, as according to the complainant, he has
misused the articles found in the safe locker including
the documents pertaining to the property left behind by
the parents of the complainant.
22.    Therefore, this Court is of the considered
opinion that a case is made out by the petitioners to
quash the further proceedings as against them only.
23.    Hence, the following order is passed:
The criminal petition is allowed.
The order of taking cognizance dated 01.10.2021
passed by Additional Civil Judge and JMFC-III Court at
Raichur, in C.C.No.24172/2021 (Crime No.110/2018 of
Netaji Nagar Police Station, Raichur) for the offences
punishable under Sections 420, 409, 120(B) of IPC and
all further proceedings pursuant thereto is hereby
quashed only as against the petitioners herein.
However, this shall not act as precedent for the
first accused to obtain similar order.
