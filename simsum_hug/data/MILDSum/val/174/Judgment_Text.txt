All the sentences were ordered to run concurrently.
In nutshell, facts relevant and essential for disposal of the
criminal appeal are noted hereinbelow:-
Complainant Jairam (P.W.19) submitted a written report
(Ex.P/8) to the SHO, Police Station Sojat, District Pali on
28.02.1992 at 12:15 p.m. alleging inter alia that in the morning,
one Budharam Sirvi, resident of Village Atabada, visited his house
and informed his elder brother Pemaram that his daughter Indra
(Pemaram’s daughter) was not well so they had to visit her at her
house. On this, all the family members went to Indra’s house,
where they saw that dead body of Indra was lying on the floor and
blood stains were found on her mouth. They asked to Kanaram on
which, he feigned ignorance by saying that on previous night, he
was at his aunt’s house and when he returned back in the morning
he saw that Indra was hanging by a noose.
On the basis of this report, FIR No.50/1992(Ex.P/36) came
to be registered at the Police Station Sojat, District Pali for the
offences under Sections 498A and 304B IPC and investigation was
The usual investigation was undertaken. The dead body of
Indra was subjected to postmortem by a Medical Jurist at
Government Hospital, Sojat, which issued a postmortem report
(3 of 5)              [CRLA-277/1996]
(Ex.P/18) wherein, cause of death was opined to be asphyxia due
to strangulation.
The accused-appellants were arrested vide Memos Ex.P/13,
Ex.P/14 and Ex.P/37 and weapon of offence i.e. knife vide Memo
Ex.P/15 and their own blood stained clothes vide Memo Ex.P/34
were recovered by the Investigating Officer during investigation.
Ultimately, after completing the investigation, a charge sheet
came to be filed against the accused-appellants Sayari and Moti
Bai for the offence under Section 498A and against accused
Kanaram for the offence under Sections 498A and 302 IPC in the
court concerned.
As the offence under Section 302 IPC was exclusively triable
by the Court of Sessions the case was committed to the Court of
Sessions Judge, Pali, from where, it was transferred to the Court
of Additional Sessions Judge, Sojat for trial where charges were
framed against the accused-appellants for the above offences.
They pleaded not guilty and claimed trial. The prosecution
examined as many as 31 witnesses and exhibited 38 documents
to prove its case. The accused-appellants were questioned under
Section   313   CrPC    and upon     being   confronted    with   the
circumstances     appearing against     them  in   the   prosecution
evidence, they denied the same and claimed to be innocent.
However, no oral evidence was led in defence.     At the conclusion
of the trial, after hearing the arguments advanced by the
prosecution and the defence counsel and upon appreciating the
evidence available on record, the learned trial court proceeded to
convict and sentence the accused-appellants as above.         Hence,
this appeal.
Learned counsel for the appellants at the outset, stated that
so far as appellants No.2 and 3 Smt. Moti Bai and Kana Ram are
concerned, they expired during pendency of the appeal and hence
the appeal stood abated to their extent vide orders dated
19.08.2020 and 03.09.2020.
As per order of this Court dated 03.01.2022, the verification
report regarding appellant Sayari, submitted by the SHO, Sojat
City, District Pali, is taken on record.
Learned counsel for the appellants does not challenge the
conviction of the appellant-Sayari as recorded by the learned
Additional Sessions Judge, Sojat.             He further submits that
appellant-Sayari has already attained the age of 82 years and the
sentences awarded to her be reduced to the one already
undergone by her by taking a sympathetic and lenient view. He
submitted that out of the total           sentence awarded, appellant
Sayari has already undergone around two and half months of
sentence and she was released on bail by order of this Court on
19.05.1992. Learned counsel for the appellant also submitted that
looking to the Covid Pandemic, if the appellant is now directed to
serve the remaining sentences, there would be danger to the life
of the appellant as she is in the eve of her life and would be put at
risk of life threatening infection, if sent to the prison at this age.
Learned Public Prosecutor vehemently and fervently opposed
the submissions advanced by the appellants counsel.
We     have    given   our  thoughtful     consideration   to  the
submissions advanced at the Bar and have gone through the
impugned judgment.
Taking into consideration the overall facts and circumstances
of the case we are of the view that as appellant Sayari has already
attained the age of 82 years, the sentences awarded to her be
reduced to the period already undergone by her which is nearly
two and half months.
The appeal thus deserves to be and is hereby accepted in
part. While affirming conviction of the appellant-Sayari for the
offence under Section 498A IPC as recorded by the trial court by
the impugned judgment dated 17.04.1996 passed by the learned
Additional Sessions Judge, Sojat, Pali, the sentence awarded to
the appellant is reduced to the period already undergone by her.
The appellant is on bail. She need not surrender, if not required in
any other case. Her bail bonds are discharged.
The appeal is partly allowed in these terms.
However, keeping in view the provisions of Section 437-A
Cr.P.C., the appellant is directed to furnish a personal bond in the
sum of Rs.40,000/- and a surety bond in the like amount before
the learned trial court, which shall be effective for a period of six
months to the effect that in the event of filing of a Special Leave
Petition against the present judgment on receipt of notice thereof,
the appellants shall appear before the Supreme Court.
Record be sent back forthwith.
