Sri Nishant Mishra, learned counsel for the petitioner has stated that petitioner
does not want to press relief Nos. 'A' and 'B' and thus, the challenge to the
validity of the provisions are withdrawn. Accordingly, the relief Nos. 'A' and 'B'
are held to have not been pressed by the petitioner.
Petitioner filed refund application for tax period from April to June, 2018, July
to September, 2018 and October to December, 2018, which have been rejected
by the impugned order, passed by the respondent no.4.
As per impugned order, the period of limitation for filing refund application in
terms of Section 54(1) of the CGST/UPGST Act, had expired in September,
2020 and even period extended by the department has also expired on
30.11.2020. Thereafter, petitioner filed refund application on 31.03.2021, which
has been rejected by the impugned order on the ground of delay.
Learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that the period between 15.03.2020
to 28.02.2022 has been directed by the Supreme Court to be excluded for the
purposes of limitation as may be prescribed under any general or special laws in
respect of all judicial or quasi-judicial proceedings, vide impugned order dated
10.01.2022 in Misc. Application No. 21 of 2022, Suo-Moto Writ Petition (C)
No.3 of 2020. He, therefore, submits that refund application has been arbitrarily
rejected by the respondent no.4.
Learned Standing Counsel could not dispute the exclusion period from
15.03.2020 to 28.02.2022 as provided by the Hon'ble Supreme Court for the
purposes of limitation.
We have carefully considered the submissions of the learned counsel for the
Hon'ble Supreme Court vide its order dated 10.01.2022 directed as under:-
" Taking into consideration the arguments advanced by learned counsel and the
impact of the surge of the virus on public health and adversities faced by litigants
in the prevailing conditions, we deem it appropriate to disposed of the M.A. No.
I. The order dated 23.03.2020 is restored and in continuation of the subsequent
orders dated 08.03.2021, 27.04.2021 and 23.09.2021, it is directed that the
period from 15.03.2020 till 28.02.2022 shall stand excluded for the purposes of
limitation as may be prescribed under any general or special laws in respect of all
judicial or quasi-judicial proceedings.
II. Consequently, the balance period of limitation remaining as on 03.10.2021, if
any, shall become available with effect from 01.03.2022.
III. In cases where the limitation would have expired during the period between
15.03.2020 till 28.02.2022, notwithstanding the actual balance period of
limitation remaining, all persons shall have a limitation period of 90 days from
01.03.2022. In the event the actual balance period of limitation remaining, with
effect from 01.03.2022 is greater than 90 days, that longer period shall apply.
IV. It is further clarified that the period from 15.03.2020 till 28.02.2022 shall also
stand excluded in computing the periods prescribed under sections 23(4) and 29A
of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, Section 12A of the Commercial
Courts Act, 2015 and provisos (b) and (c) of Section 138 of the Negotiable
Instruments Act 1881 and any other laws, which prescribe period (s) of limitation
for instituting proceeding, outer limits (within which the court or tribunal can
The aforequoted order has been passed by Hon'ble Supreme Court due to the
prevailing situation on account of the Covid pandemic.
On the fact of the present case, we find that the refund application of the
petitioner could not have been rejected by the respondent no.4 merely on the
ground of delay, ignoring the aforequoted order of Hon'ble Supreme Court.
Under the circumstances, the impugned order cannot be sustained and is hereby
quashed. Matter is remitted back to the respondent no.4 to decide the refund
application of the petitioner in accordance with law, by reasoned and speaking
order, expeditiously and preferably within six weeks from the date of
presentation of copy of the order, after affording reasonable opportunity of
hearing to the petitioner.
Subject to the observations made above, the writ petition is disposed of.
