Defendants 1 and 2 in W.O.S.No.64 of 2007 on the
files of the Wakf Tribunal, Ernakulam, are the
revision petitioners, and the respondents 1 to 3
herein were plaintiffs 1 and 2 and 3rd defendant. The
parties are referred to as they are arrayed before the
2.     The   suit   was    filed    by  the plaintiffs   for
declaration and injunction. The averments in the plaint,
in brief, are as follows:
The plaintiffs are members and beneficiaries of
Elappully        Eranchery    Jama-ath      Palli. It  is  a   wakf
represented        by   the    1st  defendant/president    and   2nd
defendant/secretary. When the plaintiffs and 40 members
of the 1st defendant wakf attended a religious discourse
conducted        by   the   Kerala     Naduvathul   Mujahideen   on
20.03.2007, the 1st defendant led by its president and
secretary ex-communicated the plaintiffs and others of
the Jama-ath. They imposed a ban on the members of the
Jama-ath from participating in the marriage and their
ceremonies to be held in the houses of the plaintiffs
and others. They were also not allowed to bury the dead
bodies       of the    plaintiffs, others and their  family
members. In connection with the burial of the dead body
of one Mohammed, on 18.10.2007, there was a law and
order problem and the RDO, Palakkad, Tahsildar, Circle
Inspector and Sub Inspector of Police came to the plaint
schedule property and mediated the matter and the dead
body was buried. Thereafter a complaint was filed before
the RDO for a permanent solution to the matter. On
03.11.2007, the RDO convened a joint meeting and took a
decision         directing  the  Jama-ath committee not  to
obstruct the burial of dead bodies of Mujahideen Sect,
till they acquire an alternative burial ground of their
own. Plaintiffs have no other Jama ath or burial ground.
Plaintiffs apprehend that the defendants will obstruct
the burial of dead bodies, hence the suit was filed for
declaration of their right and prohibitory injunction.
3.     Defendants     1  and   2 filed  a  joint  written
statement. The 1st defendant wakf is administered by the
committee and the beneficiaries are the followers of
Allahu Sunnathu Val Jama-ath. Plaintiffs were members
of the 1st defendant Jama-ath and followers of Allahu
Sunnath Val Jama-ath. Thereafter they changed to Kerala
Naduvathul Mujahideen and attempted to transform the
members        of   the   1st  defendant   Jama-ath   into  that
organization.         Kerala   Naduvathul   Mujahideen  has  got
several        religious   institutions    and  wakf  properties
including mosque, madrasa, khabarsthan etc., of their
own. They have got ample institutions and khabarstan to
accommodate their believers and bury their dead bodies.
Plaintiffs and their organisations have no legal right
to bury the dead bodies in the khabarsthan of the 1st
defendant         Jama-ath.    As   per   the  agreement   dated
03.11.2007, plaintiffs have waived their claim on the
1st defendant organization and its properties, hence
prayed for dismissal of the suit.
4.     The Tribunal raised 4 issues and based on
Exts.A1 to A3 and the oral evidence of PWs 1 and 2
decreed the suit and it was declared that the plaintiffs
and similarly situated persons have the right to prayers
of the defendant mosque and to bury the dead bodies of
the family members in the 1st defendant Jama-ath. The 1st
defendant and their men were permanently restrained from
obstructing       the  plaintiffs   and   similarly   situated
persons from conducting         prayers in the mosque and
burying the dead bodies of the family members of the
khabarstan in the plaint scheduled property. Aggrieved
by the said judgment and decree this revision is filed
by the defendants 1 and 2.
5.     The  learned   counsel    for   the   petitioner
Sri.P.Jayaram submits that the religious beliefs and
practices of Allahu Sunnath Val Jama-ath and Kerala
Naduvathul Mujahideen are different in many ways. The
impugned judgment and        decree rendered by the     Wakf
Tribunal for two different fractions offering prayers
and conducting funerals in the same mosque and graveyard
will disturb the public order, morality and health of
the citizens of the muslim and hence the impugned
judgment is violative of Article 15 and 25 of the
constitution      of   India.   The  remedy   available   to
defendants 1 and 2 is to find out a separate sight of
their own choice without disturbing the followers of the
muslim in the 1st defendantâ€™s mosque. The plaintiffs
ought to have approached the Wakf Board, which is the
authority under Section 69 of the Wakf Act to frame a
scheme for the administration of the Wakf.
6.     The learned   counsel  for   the  respondents
Sri.Abdul Aziz, per contra submitted that the plaintiffs
are the members of the 1st defendant Jama-ath and since
they attended the religious discourse conducted by the
Kerala Naduvathul Mujahideen on 20.03.2007, they were
ex-communicated from       the Jama-ath. The act of the
defendants in not allowing a muslim of the 1st defendant
Jama-ath to offer prayers and buried dead bodies is
illegal and therefore they approached the Tribunal for
a    declaration      and  injunction.  The   Tribunal  after
elaborately considering the rights of the plaintiffs
have decreed the suit and the revision is only an abuse
of the process of law and the same has to be dismissed.
7.     A mosque is a place of worship and every muslim
offers prayer in the mosque. The 1st defendant has no
right to obstruct a member of the Jama-ath or any other
muslim from offering prayers. The burying of dead bodies
is also a civil right. The graveyard situated in the
plaint schedule property is a public graveyard. Every
muslim is entitled to get a decent burial according to
civil rights and the graveyard under the supervision of
1st defendant is a public graveyard, any muslim or any
member of the 1st defendant has a right to bury the dead.
The 1st defendant cannot obstruct the plaintiffs from
offering prayers in the mosque and from burying dead
bodies of their relatives stating that they have been
ex-communicated from the 1st defendant Jama-ath since
they followed the Kerala Naduvathul Mujahidhin Sect.
Admittedly, the 1st defendant is a wakf having an extent
of 1 acre and 25 cents of property wherein the mosque
building and the khabarstan are situated. The contention
raised in the written statement filed by defendants 1
and     2    is   that  since  they have  changed to  Kerala
Naduvathul Mujahidheen and attempting to transfer the
members of the 1st defendant Jama-ath their organisation
they have to delink themselves from the 1st defendant
and hence they are not entitled to offer prayers and
buried their dead bodies. The said contention will not
stand in the eye of the law because every muslim is
entitled to offer prayers in any mosque or buried dead
bodies in a public khabarsthan. The 1st defendant's
mosque        and   khabarsthan  being  a  public  one,  the
defendants cannot obstruct the plaintiffs in offering
prayers and burying the dead. The Tribunal found that
the apprehension raised by the plaintiffs that they will
not be allowed to offer prayers and the dead bodies of
the family members will not be allowed to be buried
because a law and order situation happened on 18.10.2007
in connection with the burial of the dead body of one
Mohammed. The Tribunal after elaborately considering the
right of the parties and the contentions raised in the
written statement decreed the suit, ongoing through the
evidence         adduced  as  well    as  the  judgment   of the
Tribunal.         We  are  of the    considered  view   that the
Tribunal was right in decreeing the suit and there is
no illegality or impropriety in the judgment passed by
the Tribunal. In view of the matter, there arise no
interference and hence the same is dismissed.
