Heard on              :     07.01.2022, 27.01.2022, 04.02.2022, 16.02.2022 & 24.02.2022
The appellant has assailed the judgment and order dated 30th March,
2016 and 31st March, 2016 passed by the learned Additional Sessions Judge,
4th      Court, Malda, in Sessions Case No. 216 of 2015 corresponding to
Sessions Trial Case No. 55(5) of 2015 arising out of Baisnabnagar Police
Station Case No. 435 of 2014 dated 05.11.2014 convicting the appellant for
commission of offence punishable under Sections 489B/489C of the Indian
Penal Code and sentencing him to suffer rigorous imprisonment for ten years
and to pay fine of Rs.5,000/-, in default, to suffer rigorous imprisonment for
six months more for the offence punishable under Section 489B of the Indian
Penal Code and to suffer rigorous imprisonment for seven years and to pay
fine of Rs.5,000/-, in default, to suffer rigorous imprisonment for six months
more for the offence punishable under Section 489C of the Indian Penal Code;
both the sentences to run concurrently.
The prosecution case as alleged against the appellant is to the effect
that on 4th November, 2014, Md. Shakur, S.I. of BSF at Baisnabnagar Police
Station (P.W. 1) received secret information that two persons are going from
Malda to NTPC with fake Indian currency notes. He along with others went to
the local police station and with police force proceeded towards the Township
More. At that spot, they found two persons sitting in a tailor shop. Upon
search, eight bundles of currency notes suspected to be fake in denomination
of Rs.1000/- (each bundle containing 800 pieces) valued at 8 lakhs wrapped
in a coffee colour cloth bag was recovered from the appellant, Habibur
Rahaman and two bundles of fake Indian currency notes in denomination of
Rs.1,000/- and Rs. 500/- (one bundle containing 176 pieces and another
containing 48 pieces respectively) valued at Rs. 2 lakhs was recovered from
his nephew, Nasiruddin Sheikh, who was a juvenile at the time of occurrence.
Other articles including genuine currency notes were also recovered.
Suspected currency notes were seized under a seizure list and the aforesaid
miscreants were arrested.      P.W. 1 lodged written complaint at the police
station resulting in registration of Baisnabnagar Police Station Case No. 435
of 2014 dated 05.11.2014 under Sections 489B/489C/120B of the Indian
Penal Code. Seized notes were sent for examination and upon receipt of the
report from the expert (Exhibit 3) charge-sheet was filed against the appellant
and the juvenile. Case of the juvenile was sent to the Juvenile Justice Board
while the appellant was tried in regular court. Charges under Sections
489B/489C were framed against the appellant. He pleaded not guilty and
claimed to be tried. In the course of trial, prosecution examined nine
witnesses and exhibited a number of documents. Defence of the appellant
was one of innocence and false implication. In conclusion of trial, learned trial
Judge by the impugned judgement and order dated 30th March, 2016 and
31st March, 2016 convicted and sentenced the appellant, as aforesaid.
Mr. Wilson, learned Counsel appearing for the appellant submits that
prosecution case is out and out false. Independent witnesses have not
supported the case. On the other hand, version of official witnesses are at
variance to one another. While in F.I.R. it was stated that appellants were
standing near a tailor shop at Township More, P.W. 1 in court stated that
they were sitting in the tailor shop. P.W. 7 stated that the accused persons
were found loitering at PTS More. P.W. 1 claimed that the operation took
place between 7 p.m. to 11 p.m. but P.W. 5 stated they reached the spot at 8
p.m. It is also submitted that all incriminating circumstances had not been
put to the accused persons during their examination under Section 313 of the
Code of Criminal Procedure. It is also submitted that there is no evidence
with regard to use of currency notes. Hence, conviction under Section 489B is
unfounded. He prays for acquittal of the appellant.
On the other hand, Mr. Chakraborty, learned Counsel appearing for the
State submits that the prosecution evidence has clearly established the
ingredients of the alleged offences. Appellant along with juvenile was
apprehended with a large volume of FICNs in public place. They could not
give any explanation with regard to carrying such counterfeit notes. Hence,
ingredients of the offence under Sections 489B and 489C have been proved.
Charge under Section 489B was framed with regard to “trafficking in
currency notes” and therefore the appellant was put on notice with regard to
the accusation of transportation of fake Indian currency notes. Independent
witnesses had been won over and, therefore, did not support the prosecution
case. Variation in the deposition of the official witnesses are minor and do not
go to the root of the prosecution case.
P.W. 1, Md. Shakur, is the informant and leader of the raiding party.
He deposed in the evening at 6p.m. he received a secret information that two
persons are going from Malda to NTPC and carrying fake currency notes. He
along with Ajit and another constable at first went to local police station and
then took police force from local police station and went to Township More.
They found two persons were sitting in a tailor shop and they searched them.
Upon search, they recovered counterfeit notes valued at Rs. 8 lakhs from the
appellant and Rs. 2 lakhs from Nasiruddin Sheikh, who is the nephew of the
appellant. Other articles were also recovered. Seizure list was prepared.
Number of counterfeit notes were noted down in the seizure list. Accused
persons were apprehended and were taken to the police station along with the
seized articles. He prepared written complaint and lodged it at the local police
station. He identified the seized counterfeit notes in court as material Exhibits
I and II.
P.Ws. 2, 3 and 5 are the constables attached to BSF at Baisnabnagar
16 Mile. They accompanied P.W. 1 to the raid. They have substantially
corroborated the evidence of P.W. 1.
P.W. 7, Koushik Sarkar is an ASI attached to Malda PS. He deposed he
along with constable Akhtar Hossain went to PTS More and was instructed to
keep in touch with BSF personnel. After reaching there, he found two
suspected persons loitering. BSF personnel apprehended them and recovered
counterfeit currency notes to the tune of Rs. 10 lakhs. He stated that local
persons signed on the seizure list. He identified the accused persons in Court.
Mr. Wilson, learned lawyer appearing for the appellant argues that
there are grave contradictions in the evidence of the official witnesses. P.W. 1
stated the accused persons were sitting in a tailor shop at township more
where they were searched but P.W. 7 deposed they were found loitering near
PTS More and were searched. It is also submitted there is variation with
regard to time when the search operation commenced.
I have examined evidence of the witnesses in the light of the aforesaid
submission. All the witnesses stated seizure list was prepared at the spot.
They had also signed on the seizure list. In the seizure list place of seizure
has been described as “township area” approximately 1.6 km from BNHQ and
2.5 km from Baishnabnagar. Investigating officer P.W. 9 has prepared rough
sketch map of the place of occurrence wherefrom it appears that the place of
occurrence was at the Township More and western side of the Township More
is noted as PTS side.
From the aforesaid materials on record it appears that the description
of the place of occurrence by P.W. 7 as PTS More is a loose and casual one.
Incident occurred at Township More which was noted in the seizure list
contemporaneously prepared by P.W. 1. Contents of the seizure list have not
been challenged. On the other hand, P.W. 1 and other witnesses have clearly
proved the place of occurrence as Township More. Version of P.W. 7 with
regard to place of occurrence is, therefore, to be assessed in the backdrop of
other evidence on record. As appearing from the sketch map, western side of
Township is described as PTS area, hence, P.W. 7 may have loosely described
the place of occurrence as PTS More. Version of P.W. 7 with regard to place of
occurrence is clearly reconciliable with regard with other evidence on record
and does not affect the credibility of the prosecution case.
P.W. 1 stated he received secret information with regard to two persons
carrying counterfeit currency notes from Malda to NTPC at 6 p.m. and
proceeded to work out the information. He went to the local police station and
obtained police assistance. Then he proceeded to Township More and
apprehended the accused persons. Entire operation continued from 7 p.m to
11p.m. But P.W. 5 claimed they conducted raid at 8.10 p.m. This minor
variation with regard to time of commencement of raid is of little consequence
when the witnesses are ad idem on the search and seizure of FICNs from the
appellant. Thus, I am of the view the evidence of the official witnesses have
proved the prosecution case.
It is contended independent witnesses P.Ws. 4 and 8 have not
supported the case. Both of them appear to have been won over and stated in
a parrot-like manner they had signed the seizure list in the police station.
Falsehood in their deposition was clearly exposed when they were confronted
with their earlier statements to the police. P.W. 7 categorically stated that the
local witnesses had signed the seizure list at the place of occurrence.
It is settled law if the evidence of the official witnesses are clear,
convincing and inspire confidence, lack of support from the independent
witnesses who have been won over and had turned hostile would not make a
dent in the prosecution case. Hence, I am of the opinion, seizure of
counterfeit notes suspected to be forged valued at Rs. 8 laks from the
appellant and Rs. 2 lakh from the juvenile accused has been proved.
P.Ws. 9 and 10 are the investigating officers of the case. PW 9 was the
first investigating officer. He visited the place of occurrence and prepared
rough sketch map with index Exhibit 5 and 5/1. He took steps to send the
FICN at Salboni Mint for examination. Thereafter he handed over the case to
P.W. 8 collected the report from Salboni Mint and submitted charge
sheet. Report from Salboni Mint has been proved as Exhibit 3. Evidence of
the investigating officers clearly establish the chain of custody between the
counterfeit currency notes which were seized from the possession of the
appellant and those examined at Salboni Mint. Exhibit 3 proves the seized
notes are counterfeit.
Lastly, it is argued ingredients of offence under section 489B IPC have
not been proved. Prosecution evidence clearly shows that the appellant and
the co-accused was apprehended in front of a tailor shop while carry
counterfeit currency notes totaling to Rs 10 lakhs.
When the appellant was found carrying a large volume of FICNs in a
public place and he is unable to give any explanation for the said possession,
one can safely held the appellant was knowingly trafficking in counterfeit
currency notes. Section 489B of the Indian Penal Code makes selling, buying,
receiving or trafficking in counterfeit currency notes culpable. In this regard,
it may be apposite to refer to the charge framed against the appellant under
section 489B of the Indian Penal Code which reads as follows:-
“that you on 4.11.2014 at township More on NH 34, under Baisnabnagar
PS Dist Malda attempted to use/traffic forged or counterfeit Indian
currency notes of Rs. 9,76,000/- of denomination of Rs. 1,000/- each
(976 pieces) and Rs. 24,000/- of denomination of Rs. 500/- each (48
pieces) and totaling Rs 10,00,000/- knowing the same to be counterfeit
and as per seizure list dated 4.11.2014, a copy of which was served to
you, knowing the same to be forged or counterfeit.”
Plain reading of the aforesaid charge shows the prosecution had put the
appellant on notice that he was being accused of “attempt to sell/trafficking”
in counterfeit notes. As discussed above, evidence on record unequivocally
shows the appellant and co-accused were apprehended while carrying a large
volume of counterfeit notes in a public place. Thus, transportation of
counterfeit notes by the appellant is clearly established. Facts of the instant
case are clearly distinguishable from that in Hoda Sk. vs. State of West
Bengal1. In that case, no charge for trafficking of counterfeit notes had been
framed by the trial court and on such premise this court was of the view the
conviction under section 489B IPC on the score of trafficking could not be
upheld. On the other hand, in the present case appellant had been charged of
trafficking in counterfeit currency notes. Thus, conviction of the appellant
under section 489B IPC does not call for interference.
In the light of the aforesaid discussion, conviction and sentence of the
appellant is upheld.
Appeal is accordingly dismissed.
Period of detention suffered by the appellant during investigation,
enquiry and trial shall be set off from the substantive sentence imposed upon
the appellant in terms of Section 428 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.
Copy of the judgment along with Lower Court Records be sent down to
the trial court at once for necessary compliance.
Urgent Photostat Certified copy of this order, if applied for, be supplied
expeditiously after complying with all necessary legal formalities.
I agree.
