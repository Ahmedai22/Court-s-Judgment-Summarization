The case of Rahul was separated from this case as Rahul
was juvenile and matter has been sent to Juvenile Justice Board
for trial.
On 03.03.2009 at around 9:00 p.m. ‘P’ (daughter of
complainant), aged about 14 years, went to attend the call of
nature in the vacant residence of M.D.A., where Rahul and Bhura
S/o Virendra, R/o Village- Palhaida came there and forcibly
picked up complainant’s daughter by holding her face and took
her to the fields and after smelling the intoxicant material, raped
her forcibly. On hearing the noise of victim, Roshan S/o Samay
Singh and Santari W/o Rajkumar went towards the fields then
both the accused ran away threatening that if told to any one,
they would kill.
On the basis of the written report (Exhibit Ka-1), the police
registered Case Crime No. 412 of 2009, under Sections 376, 506
I.P.C. against accused Rahul and Bhura. Investigation of the case
was taken over by Sub- Inspector Alok Kumar Sharma. Site
inspection was prepared by the investigator, the relevant
documents were recorded in the case diary and recorded the
statements of the witnesses.
After completing the investigation, Investigating Officer has
filed charge sheet against Rahul and Bhura, under Section 376,
506 I.P.C. Cognizance was taken by the Chief Judicial Magistrate
and committed to the court of sessions on 29.06.2021 for trial
and thereafter the said sessions trial has been transferred to the
court of Additional Sessions Judge, Court No. 3, Meerut for trial.
Charge under Sections 376G and 506 I.P.C. has been
framed by Additional Sessions Judge, Court No. 15, Meerut.
Charge was denied by the accused Bhura @ Bhure. The accused-
appellant pleaded not guilty and claimed to be tried.
In order to prove the charges framed against the appellant,
the prosecution has examined witnesses, detailed as under:-
In spite of ocular version of the witnesses, following
documents were produced and contents were proved by leading
3      Statement under Section 164 Cr.P.C.      Ext. Ka-3
4      Medical examination report               Ext. Ka-4
5      Supplementary medical report             Ext. Ka-5
9      Medical examination of prosecutrix       Ext. Ka-9
10     Pathology report                         Ext. Ka-10
In statement under Section 313 Cr.P.C. the accused has
stated that he had made love marriage with Mausi of victim due
to this enmity he was falsely implicated in this case.
The main question is that whether accused Bhura @ Bhure
has committed rape with prosecutrix on 03.03.2009 at 9:00 p.m.
when she has gone to attend the nature’s call with help of Rahul
after smelling her intoxicant material raped her forcefully.
In F.I.R. the age of the prosecutrix has been stated as 14
years, after medical examination the age of the prosecutrix was
found at 16 years as shown in Ex- KA-9. No spermatozoa seen in
the vagina smear, in Exh. KA-5 shows that no opinion regarding
can be given hymen torn, bleeding present inside vagina and
torn edge vagina admits two fingers with difficulty and painful.
Prosecutrix PW-3 had deposed in her statement on oath
that she knows accused Bhura @ Bhure who is her neighbour.
Incident took place prior four years at about 9:00 p.m, she went
for nature’s call in the vacant house of M.D.A. then Rahul and
Bhura came there and by holding her face took her to the field
and after subjecting her to the smell of intoxicant material raped
her forcefully. Rape was committed by both the accused. She
was unable to oppose them due to intoxication, she made noise
then they threatened her and if this fact was told to anyone then
she shall be killed. After hearing the scream of PW-3 her
maternal uncle Roshan and Mausi Santari came on the spot and
took her home. She told them about the incident committed by
the accused. PW-3 was medically examined and recovery memo
of her Salwar, Kurta and underwear as prepared by the police as
Exhibit Ka-2. Her statement was also recorded before the
Magistrate. She narrated entire story before the court. Witness
has also proved the statement under Section 164 Cr.P.C. as
Exhibit Ka-3. This witness was not cross examined by the
defence despite ample opportunity, consequently the cross
examination of the witness was closed by the court. As the
statement of witness is not rebutted by the defence so the
evidence is admissible and relevant for the disposal of this case.
PW-2 is the witness of recovery, before this witness clothes
of the prosecutrix was sealed and recovery memo was prepared.
He has proved the recovery memo. In the cross examination the
witness has stated that clothes related to the case are not before
him in the court, at present prosecutrix has been married.
PW-1 mother of the prosecutrix has deposed on oath that
incident took place prior two and a half year, her daughter had
gone for nature’s call at 9:00 p.m. behind the house. Accused
Bhura and Rahul R/o Village-Palhaida carried my daughter
forcefully by holding   her mouth and took her to the field and
inhaled her intoxicating substance, thereafter, both committed
rape with her daughter. On hue and cry made by her daughter,
Roshan, Santari and other members of the village came on the
spot, seeing them accused Rahul and Bhura fled away. Her
daughter told the witness about the incident. First day she was
silent due to fear and on second day lodged F.I.R. The age of her
daughter was 14 years. Witness has proved written report as
Exhibit Ka-1. Police had also taken the clothes of her daughter
and sealed it.
PW-4 Dr. Anju Jodha has proved medical report and
supplementary report as exhibit Ka-4 & Ka-5.
PW-5 Constable Harpal formal witness has proved chik
F.I.R. as exhibit Ka-6 and Kayami G.D. Ka-7.
PW-6 I.O. who had proved charge sheet as exhibit Ka-8 and
others witnesses also proved spot map as exhibit Ka-12 & Ka-13
as secondary evidence.
PW-7 senior clerk in C.M.O. office, Meerut has proved X-ray
report as exhibit Ka-10 and X-ray material as exhibited 1,2 & 3.
PW-8 Dr. Pramila Gond has also proved slide report as
exhibit Ka-11 and stated that there was no spermatozoa in the
Prosecutrix PW-3 had supported the prosecution case in her
statement under Section 164 Cr.P.C. proved as exhibit Ka-3,
statement of prosecutrix under Section 164 Cr.P.C. is as follows:-
“ On 03.03.2009 at about 9:00 p.m., she went for nature’s
call behind her home then suddenly Rahul and Bhura came there.
Rahul gagged her mouth so she could not make a noise. They
took her in the field and put a handkerchief on her face so she
became unconscious, Rahul and Bhura committed rape with her.
After sometime she became conscious she make hue and cry
then accused threatened her that they will kill her, if, she told
about the incident. After hue and cry, her maternal uncle and
aunt came there and brought her to the house where she told
the story to her mother.”
Prosecutrix   after   marriage  had   also  supported   the
prosecution version in her examination-in-chief before the trial
court, but despite ample opportunity to the defence for cross
examination, no cross examination was done by the accused.
After closing the cross examination no application for recall was
moved for cross examination of the witness. No revision has
been filed against the said order so in absence of rebuttal entire
evidence of PW-3 is fully reliable. PW-1 had also supported the
prosecution case and there is nothing in her cross examination
by which      prosecution evidence can be belied. PW-1 is also an
illiterate lady, she has supported the prosecution case and stated
that what was told by her daughter on the date of incident.
Incident took place on 03.03.2009, F.I.R. was lodged on
04.03.2009.      Medical   examination  of  the   prosecutrix was
conducted on 04.03.2009 in which it has been opined that no
mark of injury of external part of the body, hymen torn, bleeding
present from inside vagina and edge vagina admits two fingers
with difficulty and painful as shown in Exhibit Ka-4 & Ka-5. Ka-9
is her age certificate by which it is evident that age of the
prosecutrix was 16 years. From the perusal of the supplementary
report, it appears that no spermatozoa seen in the slide taken
from vagina smear. Thus medical report exhibit Ka-4 & Ka-5
supports and corroborates prosecution case. Evidence of PW-3 is
corroborated by medical evidence exhibit Ka-4 & Ka-5.
From the perusal of the record, it appears that in this case
defence counsel had cross examined PW-1, PW-2, PW-6, PW-7,
PW-8 but the learned counsel for defence had not cross
examined PW-3, PW-4, PW-5 after been given ample opportunity.
He had not also participated in the argument knowingly with
intent to delay the trial. It is also praiseworthy that prosecutrix
had fully supported prosecution version even after marriage.
Such sort of courage is appreciated. Her evidence is like an
injured witness and is fully credible and trustworthy supported by
medical evidence. We do place confidence in the deposition of
PW-1 and PW-3. F.I.R. was promptly lodged on the next day from
the date of incident, there is no grudge to falsely implicate
accused appellant. On the basis of fully reliable evidence
prosecution has proved beyond reasonable doubt that accused
Bhura @ Bhure has committed rape with prosecutrix on
03.03.2009 at 9:00 p.m. when she had gone to attend the
nature’s call as narrated by the prosecutrix. Thus the trial court
had rightly held the accused guilty for the charges under Section
376(G) and 506 I.P.C. Thus we confirm the conviction of the
appellant. It is evident that in judgment of the trial court at page
1 & 17, the date of incident has been typed inadvertently
08.03.2009 which shall be read as 03.03.2009.
The main emphasis placed before us is on the point of
sentence by the learned counsel for appellant. The submission is
that at the time of incident accused was 19 years of age, he is a
labour and is in incarceration for about 13 years and at present
he is 32 years. He is married person. Prosecutrix has also
married and living peaceful happy married life.
Learned counsel for the appellant relied on Dinesh @
Buddha Vs. State of Rajasthan, 2006 Lawsuit SC 162, decided on
28.02.2006 by Supreme Court of India in which it has been held
that the sentence provided in Section 376(2)(f) I.P.C. does not
per se become life sentence. Learned counsel for State submitted
that even in a case covered under Section 376 (2) (f) I.P.C.,
imprisonment for life can be awarded. It is to be noted that
minimum sentence of ten years has been statutorily provided
and considering the attendant circumstances the imprisonment
for life in a given case is permissible. Neither the trial court nor
the High Court has indicated any such factor. Only by applying
Section 3(2)(v) of the Atrocities Act the life sentence was
awarded. Therefore, the sentence of life imprisonment was
reduced to 10 years.
In the case of Bavo@Manubhai Ambalal Thakore Vs. State
of Gurarat 2012 (2) SCC 684 decided on 03.02.2012 by Supreme
Court in which it has been held that on the date of incident
victim was seven years age and accused was in the age of 18/19
years and that the incident occurred ten years ago, the award of
life  imprisonment    which   is maximum    prescribed   was  not
warranted and also in view of the mandate of Section 376 (2)(f)
I.P.C., the court felt that the ends of justice would be met by
imposing rigorous imprisonment for ten years. The appellant had
already    served  nearly   ten   years. The    sentence  of  life
imprisonment was modified to rigorous imprisonment for ten
Rajendra Datta Zarekar Vs. State of Goa, (2007) 14 SCC
560, the victim was aged about six years and the accused was
aged about 20 years. Ultimately, the Supreme Court confirmed
the conviction and sentence of 10 years as awarded by the High
Court. However, the fine amount of Rs.10,000/- awarded under
Section 376 (2)(f) being found to be excessive was reduced to
Learned A.G.A. submitted that accused appellant should be
punished severely without relaxation. The offence of rape is
serious offence. The physical scar may heal, but the mental scar
will always remain. When a woman is ravished, what is inflicted
is not merely physical injury but the deep sense of some
deathless shame. Judicial response to human rights cannot be
blunted by legal jugglery. A girl of 14 years who is raped is not
an accomplice. The measure of punishment in a case of rape
cannot depend upon the social status of the victim or        that
accused. It must depend upon the conduct of the accused, the
state and age of the sexually assaulted female and the gravity of
the criminal act. Crimes of violence upon women need to
severely dealt with. Protection of society and deterring the
criminal is the avowed object of law and this is required to be
achieved by imposing appropriate sentence. The sentencing
Courts     are  expected  to   consider   all  relevant  facts  and
circumstances bearing on the question of sentence and proceed
to impose a sentence commensurate with the gravity of the
offence. The court must hear the loud cry for justice by the
society in cases of the heinous crime of rape on innocent helpless
girl of tender years. Public abhorrence of the crime needs
reflection through imposition of appropriate sentence by the
court. To show mercy in the case of such heinous crime would be
travesty of justice and the plea for leniency is wholly misplaced.
It is admitted fact that at the time of incident the
prosecutrix was about 14 years and accused was 19 years. At the
time of incident accused was married person and prosecutrix
married later on and is leading a peaceful married life. The
appellant is at present 32 years and is incarceration for 13 years
for charge under Section 376(G) I.P.C. So in the present facts
and circumstances and the law laid down by the Apex Court, we
are of the view that in the present case life imprisonment would
be excessive punishment and punishment for 13 years would be
adequate punishment which the appellant has already served
out. Therefore the sentence is reduced to R.I. 13 years in place
of life imprisonment. We feel that ends of justice would suffice by
imposing R.I. for 13 years which has been served by the
appellant already. However, fine amount of Rs.5000/- being
found to be excessive reduced to Rs.3000/- in default, to further
undergo R.I. for one month.
In view of the above discussion the conviction imposed on
the appellant herein is confirmed. However, the sentence of life
imprisonment is modified to R.I. for 13 years with a fine of
Rs.3000/- in default of further undergo R.I. for one month. The
conviction and sentence imposed on the appellant under Section
506 I.P.C. is confirmed. All the sentences shall run concurrently.
With the above modification of sentence, the appeal stands
disposed of.
Office is directed to send copy of this judgment alongwith
original record to the Court concerned for necessary action and
compliance in accordance with law.
