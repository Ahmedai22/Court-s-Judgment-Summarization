Notice was issued to the opposite party no. 2 vide order dated 11.5.2005. As per
office report dated 01.8.2005, it is apparent that notice has been duly served
personally on the opposite party no. 2.

Sri Ankit Srivastava, learned State counsel is present.
This revision is of year 2005. This Court, therefore, deems it fit to proceed in the
matter on the basis of the record with the assistance of the learned State counsel.
The present criminal revision under Section 397/401 of the Code of Criminal
Procedure, 1973 (hereinafter referred to as "Cr.P.C.") has been filed before this
"It is, therefore, most respectfully prayed that this Hon'ble Court may graciously
be pleased to allow this revision and modify the judgement and order dated
1.4.2005 passed by Additional Sessions Judge (Court No. 9) Aligarh in Crl.
Revision No. 797 of 2002 Yogesh Gautam vs. State of U.P. and other, to the
extent of Rs. 1,000/- be granted to the son of Revisionist as per judgement and
order dated 31.8.2002 passed by the trial court; otherwise the revisionist as well
as her son shall suffer irreparable loss.
It is further prayed that this Hon'ble Court may also be pleased to stay the effect
and operation of the impugned judgement and order dated 1.4.2005 passed by
Addl. Sessions Judge (Court No. 9) Aligarh in Crl. Revision No. 797 of 2002,
Yogesh Gautam vs. State of U.P. and others, during the pendency of present
revision before this Hon'ble Court so that justice may be done."
Heard Sri Ankit Srivastava, learned State counsel and perused the material on
record including the impugned order.
Vide order dated 1.4.2005 the revisional court has modified the order dated
31.8.2002 to the extent that Rs. 1000/- per month be given to the revisionist and
Rs. 400/- per month be given to her minor children from the date of order.
The view as taken by the revisional court of granting Rs.1000/- per month to the
revisionist and Rs. 400/- to her minor children the date of order is illegal. The
Apex Court in the Case of Rajnesh Vs. Neha and another : Criminal Appeal
No. 730 of 2020 (Arising out of SLP (Crl.) 9503 of 2018) decided on
November 4, 2020 : 2020 SCC Online SC 903, in para-10, has held that the
maintenance has to be awarded from the date of application. It has held as
There is no provision in the HMA with respect to the date from which an Order
of maintenance may be made effective. Similarly, Section 12 of the D.V. Act,
does not provide the date from which the maintenance is to be awarded.
Section 125(2) Cr.P.C. is the only statutory provision which provides that the
Magistrate may award maintenance either from the date of the order, or from
the date of application. [K. Sivaram vs. K. Mangalamba and others: 1989(1)
In the absence of a uniform regime, there is a vast variance in the practice
adopted by the Family Courts in the country, with respect to the date from which
maintenance must be awarded. The divergent views taken by the Family Courts
are : first, from the date on which the application for maintenance was filed;
second, the date of the order granting maintenance; third, the date on which the
summons was served upon the respondent.
The view that maintenance ought to be granted from the date when the
application was made, is based on the rationale that the primary object of
maintenance laws is to protect a deserted wife and dependant children from
destitution and vagrancy. If maintenance is not paid from the date of
application, the party seeking maintenance would be deprived of sustenance,
owing to the time taken for disposal of the application, which often runs into
several years.
The Orissa High Court in Susmita Mohanty v Rabindra Nath Sahu, 1996(I)
OLR 361 held that the legislature intended to provide a summary, quick and
comparatively inexpensive remedy to the neglected person. Where a litigation is
prolonged, either on account of the conduct of the opposite party, or due to the
heavy docket in Courts, or for unavoidable reasons, it would be unjust and
contrary to the object of the provision, to provide maintenance from the date of
the order.
In Kanhu Charan Jena v. Smt. Nirmala Jena, 2001 Cri L.J. 879, the Orissa High
Court was considering an application u/S. 125 Cr.P.C., wherein it was held that
even though the decision to award maintenance either from the date of
application, or from the date of order, was within the discretion of the Court, it
would be appropriate to grant maintenance from the date of application. This
was followed in Arun Kumar Nayak v Urmila Jena, (2010) 93 AIC 726 (Ori)
wherein it was reiterated that dependents were entitled to receive maintenance
from the date of application.
The Madhya Pradesh High Court in Krishna Jain v Dharam Raj Jain, 1993 (2)
MPJR 63 held that a wife may set up a claim for maintenance to be granted
from the date of application, and the husband may deny it. In such cases, the
Court may frame an issue, and decide the same based on evidence led by
parties. The view that the "normal rule" was to grant maintenance from the date
of order, and the exception was to grant maintenance from the date of
application, would be to insert something more in Section 125(2)Cr.P.C., which
the Legislature did not intend. Reasons must be recorded in both cases. i.e.
when maintenance is awarded from the date of application, or when it is
awarded from the date of order.
The law governing payment of maintenance u/S. 125 Cr.P.C. from the date of
application, was extended to HAMA by the Allahabad High Court in Ganga
Prasad Srivastava v Additional District Judge, Gonda & Ors.51 The Court held
that the date of application should always be regarded as the starting point for
payment of maintenance. The Court was considering a suit for maintenance u/S.
18 of HAMA, wherein the Civil Judge directed that maintenance be paid from
the date of judgment. The High Court held that the normal inference should be
that the order of maintenance would be effective from the date of application. A
party seeking maintenance would otherwise be deprived of maintenance due to
the delay in disposal of the application, which may arise due to paucity of time
of the Court, or on account of the conduct of one of the parties. In this case,
there was a delay of seven years in disposing of the suit, and the wife could not
be made to starve till such time. The wife was held to be entitled to maintenance
from the date of application / suit.
The Delhi High Court in Lavlesh Shukla v Rukmani, Crl. Rev. Pet. No.
851/2019, decided by the Delhi High Court vide order dated 29.11.2019, held
that where the wife is unemployed and is incurring expenses towards
maintaining herself and the minor child / children, she is entitled to receive
maintenance from the date of application. Maintenance is awarded to a wife to
overcome the financial crunch, which occurs on account of her separation from
her husband. It is neither a matter of favour to the wife, nor any charity done by
the husband.
The second view that maintenance ought to be awarded from the date of order is
based on the premise that the general rule is to award maintenance from the
date of order, and grant of maintenance from the date of application must be the
exception. The foundation of this view is based on the interpretation of Section
"(2) Any such allowance for the maintenance or interim maintenance and
expenses for proceeding shall be payable from the date of the order, or, if so
ordered, from the date of the application for maintenance or interim
maintenance and expenses of proceeding, as the case may be."
The words "or, if so ordered" in Section 125 has been interpreted to mean that
where the court is awarding maintenance from the date of application, special
reasons ought to be recorded. [Bina Devi & Ors. v State of Uttar Pradesh &
Ors. (2010) 69 ACC 19]In Bina Devi v State of U.P., (2010) 69 ACC 19, the
Allahabad High Court on an interpretation of S.125(2) of the Cr.P.C. held that
when maintenance is directed to be paid from the date of application, the Court
must record reasons. If the order is silent, it will be effective from the date of the
order, for which reasons need not be recorded. The Court held that Section
125(2) Cr.P.C. is prima facie clear that maintenance shall be payable from the
date of the order.
The Madhya Pradesh High Court in Amit Verma v Sangeeta Verma & Ors.
C.R.R. No. 3542/2019 decided by the Madhya Pradesh High Court vide Order
dated 08.1.2020, directed that maintenance ought to be granted from the date of
the order.
The third view followed by some Courts is that maintenance ought to be granted
from the date of service of summons upon the respondent.
The Kerala High Court in S. Radhakumari v K.M.K. Nair, AIR 1983 Ker 139,
was considering an application for interim maintenance preferred by the wife in
divorce proceedings filed by the husband. The High Court held that
maintenance must be awarded to the wife from the date on which summons were
served in the main divorce petition. The Court relied upon the judgment of the
Calcutta High Court in Samir Banerjee v Sujata Banerjee, 70 CWN 633, and
held that Section 24 of the HMA does not contain any provision that
maintenance must be awarded from a specific date. The Court may, in exercise
of its discretion, award maintenance from the date of service of summons.
The Orissa High Court in Gouri Das v Pradyumna Kumar Das, 1986 (II) OLR
44, was considering an application for interim maintenance filed u/S. 24 HMA
by the wife, in a divorce petition instituted by the husband. The Court held that
the ordinary rule is to award maintenance from the date of service of summons.
It was held that in cases where the applicant in the maintenance petition is also
the petitioner in the divorce petition, maintenance becomes payable from the
date when summons is served upon the respondent in the main proceeding.
In Kalpana Das v Sarat Kumar Das, AIR 2009 Ori 133, the Orissa High Court
held that the wife was entitled to maintenance from the date when the husband
entered appearance. The Court was considering an application for interim
maintenance u/S. 24 HMA in a petition for restitution of conjugal rights filed by
the wife. The Family Court awarded interim maintenance to the wife and minor
child from the date of the order. In an appeal filed by the wife and minor child
seeking maintenance from the date of application, the High Court held that the
Family Court had failed to assign any reasons in support of its order, and
"9. …Learned Judge. Family Court has not assigned any reason as to why he
passed the order of interim maintenance w.e.f. the date of order. When
admittedly the parties are living separately and prima facie it appears that the
Petitioners have no independent source of income, therefore, in our view order
should have been passed for payment of interim maintenance from the date of
The judgments hereinabove reveal the divergent views of different High Courts
on the date from which maintenance must be awarded.
Even though a judicial discretion is conferred upon the Court to grant
maintenance either from the date of application or from the date of the order in
S. 125(2) Cr.P.C., it would be appropriate to grant maintenance from the date of
application in all cases, including Section 125 Cr.P.C. In the practical working
of the provisions relating to maintenance, we find that there is significant delay
in disposal of the applications for interim maintenance for years on end. It
would therefore be in the interests of justice and fair play that maintenance is
awarded from the date of the application.
In Shail Kumari Devi and Ors. v Krishnan Bhagwan Pathak, (2008) 9 SCC 632,
this Court held that the entitlement of maintenance should not be left to the
uncertain date of disposal of the case. The enormous delay in disposal of
proceedings justifies the award of maintenance from the date of application. In
Bhuwan Mohan Singh v Meena, (2015) 6 SCC 353, this Court held that
repetitive adjournments sought by the husband in that case resulted in delay of 9
years in the adjudication of the case. The delay in adjudication was not only
against human rights, but also against the basic embodiment of dignity of an
individual. The delay in the conduct of the proceedings would require grant of
maintenance to date back to the date of application.
The rationale of granting maintenance from the date of application finds its
roots in the object of enacting maintenance legislations, so as to enable the wife
to overcome the financial crunch which occurs on separation from the husband.
Financial constraints of a dependant spouse hampers their capacity to be
effectively represented before the Court. In order to prevent a dependant from
being reduced to destitution, it is necessary that maintenance is awarded from
the date on which the application for maintenance is filed before the concerned
In Badshah v Urmila Badshah Godse (2014) 1 SCC 188, the Supreme Court was
considering the interpretation of Section 125 Cr.P.C. The Court held :
"13.3. …purposive interpretation needs to be given to the provisions of Section
125 CrPC. While dealing with the application of a destitute wife or hapless
children or parents under this provision, the Court is dealing with the
marginalised sections of the society. The purpose is to achieve "social justice"
which is the constitutional vision, enshrined in the Preamble of the Constitution
of India. The Preamble to the Constitution of India clearly signals that we have
chosen the democratic path under the rule of law to achieve the goal of securing
for all its citizens, justice, liberty, equality and fraternity. It specifically
highlights achieving their social justice. Therefore, it becomes the bounden duty
of the courts to advance the cause of the social justice. While giving
interpretation to a particular provision, the court is supposed to bridge the gap
It has therefore become necessary to issue directions to bring about uniformity
and consistency in the Orders passed by all Courts, by directing that
maintenance be awarded from the date on which the application was made
before the concerned Court. The right to claim maintenance must date back to
the date of filing the application, since the period during which the maintenance
proceedings remained pending is not within the control of the applicant."
Looking to the facts of the case and the the legal proposition as laid down by the
Apex Court in the case of Rajnesh (Supra), the present criminal revision is
partly allowed.
The judgement and order dated 1.4.2005 passed by Additional Sessions Judge
(Court No. 9) Aligarh in Crl. Revision No. 797 of 2002 Yogesh Gautam vs. State
of U.P. and other, is set aside, in so far as it issues a direction for payment of
maintenance from the date of order.
