1.     By way of this application filed under Section 482 of the
Code of Criminal Procedure read with Article 226 of the
Constitution of India, the applicants have prayed to quash and
set aside the order dated 18.11.2019 passed by the Court of
learned 13th Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate, Rajkot below
Exhibit-1 in Criminal Case No.16873 of 2019 whereby, the
complaint         filed by  respondent      No.2    herein,          original
complainant, under section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments
Act, 1881 (hereinafter referred to as the NI Act”) was ordered
to be registered and process under Section 204 of Cr.P.C. was
ordered to be issued against the applicants herein and have
also prayed to quash and set aside all the consequential
proceedings initiated under Criminal Case No.16873 of 2019.
2.     The facts in brief are as under;
The applicant No.1 herein is a Company registered under
the Companies Act, 1956 and having its Registered Office at
“Dashrathvadi, Court Road, Naidad”. It is engaged in the
business of production of Grey Cast Iron and Nodular Iron
(Ductile Iron) castings weighing from 5 Kgs to 150 Kgs and is
also a supplier of fully finished parts to Original Equipment
Manufacturers since the year 1956. The factory premises of
applicant No.1 Company is located at Nadiad and it employs
around 1500 workers. The respondent No.2 herein is a
Partnership Firm registered under the provisions of the Indian
Partnership Act and is engaged in the business of manufacture
of Casting Parts. It also accepts orders and manufacturers
casting parts as per requirements of different customers.
2.1    It appears that the parties were into business relations for
several years. However, in the year 2014, problem arose in
their business relation when a large number of parts that had
been supplied by the respondent No.2 to applicant No.1
Company, which, in turn, had supplied it to its clients were
rejected and returned to applicant No.1 Company for being
defective or of inferior quality. It is the say of the applicants
that on account of the defective parts manufactured by the
No.2, which were, in turn, supplied by the applicants to the
Original Equipment Manufacturers, who were mainly into the
Automobile industry, defects were reported in the vehicles in
which the parts were used and resultantly, the automobile
manufactures had to call back several numbers of vehicles for
carrying out necessary repair works. As a result thereof, the
applicant No.1 Company had suffered huge financial loss and
had sustained a big blow on its reputation and goodwill in the
2.2    The respondent No.2 herein filed a summary suit being
Special Summary Suit No.23 of 2014 against the applicant No.1
Company before the Court of learned 4 th Additional Senior
Civil Judge at Rajkot under Order 37 of the Code of Civil
Procedure for recovery of an amount of Rs.1,12,26,500/- being
the amount payable with interest by the applicant-defendant to
the respondent-plaintiff for the work executed and goods
delivered as per the order placed by applicant No.1 Company.
In the suit proceeding, the applicant No.1 Company preferred
an application seeking Leave to Defend; however, the same
was rejected. Thereafter, vide judgment and order dated
07.05.2015, the Court of learned 4 th Additional Senior Civil
Judge at Rajkot decreed Special Summary Suit No.23 of 2014
in favour of the respondent-plaintiff and directed the applicant
No.1-Company to pay an amount of Rs.1,12,26,500/- along
with 6% interest to the respondent-plaintiff.
2.3    Against the said judgment and decree dated 07.05.2015
passed by the civil Court, the applicant No.1 Company
preferred appeal being First Appeal No.1730 of 2015 before
this Court along with an application seeking stay of the said
judgment and decree. While admitting the First Appeal vide
order dated 29.01.2016, the Division Bench of this Court
granted interim relief in favour of applicant No.1 Company by
staying operation and implementation of the judgment and
decree dated 07.05.2015 on condition that applicant No.1
Company deposits an amount of Rs.43,40,061/- before the civil
Court within the stipulated period and to furnish appropriate
security to the satisfaction of the civil Court for the remaining
amount. As the applicant No.1 Company failed to make such
deposit,       the   respondent-complainant      instituted       execution
petition being Special Execution Petition No.24 of 2015 before
the civil Court at Rajkot and upon transfer of the petition to
the Commercial Court, it was re-numbered as Execution
Petition No.10 of 2019.
2.4    In the execution proceedings, the respondent-plaintiff
moved application Exhibit-11 seeking issuance of warrant for
the attachment of the movable / immovable properties of
applicant No.1 Company. Before the said application was
decided, the respondent-plaintiff moved another application
vide Exhibit-15 seeking identical relief. It appears that the civil
at Rajkot allowed application Exhibit-15 ex-parte vide order
dated      22.03.2016     directing     issuance  of   a     Warrant             of
Attachment against the applicant No.1 Company. On the same
day, the civil Court also passed an order disposing of the
application Exhibit-11 by observing that in spite of the service
of application on applicant No.1 Company, no reply had been
filed by applicant No.1 Company and necessary orders have
already been passed in application Exhibit-15. In pursuance
thereof, the Court of learned Principal Senior Civil Judge at
Rajkot issued Warrant of Attachment dated 31.03.2016 against
the applicant No.1 Company.
2.5    It is the say of the applicants that the respondent-
complainant,         armed  with    the      attachment     warrant           dated
31.03.2016, came at the factory premises of applicant No.1
Company situated at District : Nadiad with few men and began
to load the goods, equipments and other movable properties,
etc. kept at the factory premises into Trucks. They also
threatened to remove the machineries / equipments installed at
the factory premises and to disrupt the production process. The
applicant No.2 herein, who was present at the factory premises
at    the     relevant   time,  negotiated        with    the     respondent-
complainant to salvage the situation. In pursuance thereof, the
parties executed a Deed of Undertaking titled “Bahedaari
Karar” dated 07.04.2016 on a Rs.100/- Stamp Paper in the
presence of the Court Bailiff, which is evident from the report
filed by the Court Bailiff vide Annexure-H. In the said Deed of
Undertaking, it has been averred that the respondent has filed
Special Summary Suit No.24 of 2015 in the civil Court at
Rajkot. In the said proceeding, the Court below issued Warrant
of Attachment on 31.03.2016 for Rs.1,23,13,879/-. When the
parties reached the factory premises of C.M. Smith at Nadiad
for serving the Warrant of Attachment, the respondent is given
11 cheques. The Eleventh cheque bearing No.807621 drawn on
Ahmedabad is of Rs.69,62,879/- and the said cheque is to be
kept as Security. It is further stated that the said cheque is not
to be deposited by the respondent in the Bank until the final
outcome of the Summary Suit and the First Appeal filed before
this High Court. It was also agreed upon that hearing of the
First Appeal filed before this High Court has to be concluded
in one year and that if the First Appeal is disposed of as
aforesaid, then appropriate decision shall be taken as regards
the aforesaid cheque given as security after carrying out due
deliberations and discussions with C.M. Smith. If C.M. Smith
becomes unsuccessful in getting the First Appeal disposed of
within two years, then the respondent shall have the right to
deposit the aforesaid cheque. It is also recorded that the said
Deed of Undertaking was executed at the free will of the
parties and without any coercion.
2.6    It appears that against the Warrant of Attachment, the
applicant No.1 Company had preferred Special Civil Application
No.7417 of 2016 before this Court. The said petition came to
be disposed of by the coordinate Bench of this Court vide
order dated 18.11.2016. Paragraphs – 4 to 6 of the order reads
“4. In light of the statement made at bar, order dated
22.03.2016 passed by the learned 12th Additional Senior
Civil Judge, Rajkot below Exh.15 in Special Execution
Petition No.24 of 2015 is hereby quashed and set aside
and the learned Executing Court is directed to decide
application Exhs.11 and 15 afresh and pass appropriate
order after hearing both sides. So far as request to return
the amount of cheque is concerned, the said request is
kept open to be agitated before the learned Executing
Court. The learned Executing Court is directed to consider
such request while deciding application Exhs.11 and 15
afresh. Meanwhile, the respondent shall not deposit the
cheques issued by the petitioner for execution of decree
till final disposal of application Exhs.11 and 15.
5.       It is made clear that this Court has not examined
application Exhs.11 and 15 on merits and the learned
Executing Court shall decide the same on merits
uninfluenced by the observations recorded in the
impugned order as well as concessional statement made
at bar by the learned advocate appearing for the
respondent. Not only that, the learned Executing Court
shall pass appropriate order of refund of cheque amounts
realized while executing order dated 22.03.2016 and also
order to return unrealized cheques to the petitioner, if
application Exhs.11 and 15 are decided in favour of the
petitioner.
6.       In view of the above observation and direction,
present petition stands disposed of. Direct service is
permitted...”
2.7    Pursuant to the order dated 18.11.2016 passed by this
Court, the Court of learned Principal Senior Civil Judge, Rajkot
adjudicated applications Exhibits – 11 and 15 afresh and vide
order dated 20.08.2019, the trial Court confirmed its earlier
order passed below applications Exhibits – 11 and 15. The said
order dated 20.08.2019 was challenged before this Court in
Special Civil Application No.15137 of 2019. While disposing of
the said writ petition by way of judgment and order dated
16.10.2019, the Division Bench of this Court made the
following observations:
“32. At least one thing is clear that the impugned order
is not tenable in law and it will have to be quashed and
set-aside.
33. In the result, this petition succeeds and is hereby
allowed. The impugned order passed by the Principal
Senior Civil Judge, Rajkot, dated 20th August 2019 below
Exhibits 11 and 15 respectively in the Execution Petition
No.10 of 2019 is hereby quashed and set-aside.
34. However, we reserve the liberty for the respondent
(decree holder) to prefer an application in the court
which passed the decree against the applicant for transfer
of the decree to the court within whose territorial
jurisdiction the immovable properties of the applicant are
situated. In fact, clause (2) of Section 39 also provides
that the court which passed a decree may of its own
motion send it for execution to any subordinate court of
competent jurisdiction. In other words, while sub-section
(1) deals with transfer to another competent court having
jurisdiction or assets being located within its jurisdiction,
sub-section (2) empowers the court passing the decree on
its own motion to transfer it for execution to any
subordinate court of competent jurisdiction. Sub-section
(2) confers a suo motu power to assign a decree for
execution of its own motion to any subordinate court.
The exercise of the power under sub-section (2) of
Section 39 of the Code, to send the decree for execution
to a subordinate court can be exercised without meeting
the requirements of sub-clauses (a) to (d) under sub-
section (1) of Section 39 of the Code.
35. Mr.Pandya, the learned counsel appearing for the
respondent, submitted that he would advise his client to
prefer an appropriate application at the earliest under
Section 39 of the Code for transfer of the decree. If any
such application is preferred, the court concerned shall
pass appropriate order at the earliest after giving
opportunity of hearing to the other side.
36. With the above, this petition is disposed of. Rule
made absolute to the aforesaid extent.”
2.8    It appears that the respondent-complainant presented the
cheque       of     Rs.69,62,879/-    bearing   No.807621       drawn            on
Ahmedabad with the Bank on 06.09.2019. However, the
cheque got returned on 07.09.2019 with the endorsement of
“Drawers signature not as per mandate”. In pursuance thereof,
the respondent-complainant issued Notice dated 10.10.2019 to
the applicants under section 138 of the NI Act. The applicants
replied to the said notice vide reply dated 13.11.2019. On
18.11.2019 the respondent-complainant filed complaint under
section 138 of the NI Act before the Court of learned 13 th
Additional Senior Civil Judge & A.C.J.M., Rajkot, which was
numbered as Criminal Case No.16873 of 2019. On the said
complaint, the Court below passed the impugned order dated
18.11.2019 below Exhibit-1 directing issuance of process under
Section 204 of Cr.P.C. Being aggrieved by the same, the
present application has been preferred.
3.     Mr. Y.S. Lakhani, learned Senior Advocate appearing with
Mr. Aditya J. Pandya for the applicants, submitted that the
process issued by the Court below is contrary to the settled
principles of law related to negotiable instruments. For a
complaint under Section 138 of the NI Act to be sustainable,
the disputed cheque should have been issued in respect of any
“enforceable debt”, which the drawer is liable to pay to the
holder in due course. If the cheque is not issued in furtherance
of any such “enforceable debt”, then no cognizance under
Section 138 of the NI Act could be taken. It was also urged
that the cheque in question was given as ‘security’, which is
evident from the Deed of Undertaking dated 07.04.2016
executed       before the Court    Bailiff. The   said         Deed          of
Undertaking clarifies the fact that the cheque in question was
given as ‘security’ and not in connection with any ‘enforceable
debt’. He, therefore, contended that the Court below has
committed serious error in law and on facts in issuing process
to the applicants on the complaint filed by the respondent-
complainant under Section 138 of the NI Act.
3.1    The learned Senior Advocate further submitted that the
entire process was initiated in pursuance of the order dated
23.03.2016 passed by the Court of learned Principal Senior
Civil Judge at Rajkot below applications Exhibits – 11 and 15
in Execution Petition No.10 of 2019. It was contended that the
said order dated 23.03.2016 is void ab initio inasmuch as the
civil Court at Rajkot Court had no jurisdiction to issue Warrant
of Attachment in respect of properties which are situated
beyond the jurisdiction of Rajkot. He pointed out that the
properties of applicant No.1 Company, in respect of which the
Warrant of Attachment was issued, are situated in District
Nadiad, which does not fall within the jurisdiction of the Court
of learned Principal Senior Civil Judge at Rajkot as both the
places fall under different jurisdictions. Only the civil Court
situated at Nadiad would have the jurisdiction to pass an order
of issuance of Warrant of Attachment against the applicant
No.1 Company. Hence, the order directing issuance of Warrant
of Attachment against the applicant No.1 Company was illegal
and erroneous.
3.2    It was urged by learned Senior Advocate Mr. Lakhani
that    it   was     in pursuance   of     the aforesaid     Warrant            of
Attachment that applicant No.2 had issued the cheque in
question in favour of the respondent-complainant. It was
pointed out that this Court has passed detailed orders on the
legality of the Warrant of Attachment issued by the civil Court
at Rajkot in Special Civil Application No.7417 of 2016 and
Special Civil Application No.15137 of 2019. Now, when the
order directing issuance of Warrant of Attachment itself is
found to be illegal, all consequential proceedings would be
rendered unsustainable. Hence, the entire proceedings under
section 138 of the NI Act, which are initiated on the basis of
the cheque given by applicant No.1 Company in pursuance of
the attachment proceedings, is erroneous and unsustainable in
the eyes of law.
4.     Mr. Nilesh Pandya, learned advocate appearing with
learned advocate Mr. Haresh Patel for respondent No.2,
submitted that the cheque in question was issued in pursuance
of the settlement agreement dated 07.04.2016 executed by and
between        the   parties.  He    submitted      that     the     execution
proceedings and the proceedings under the NI Act are totally
different and independent of each other. Therefore, even if it
may be that the settlement agreement was executed in
pursuance        of  the   Warrant    of     Attachment     issued        in      the
execution proceedings initiated before the civil Court at Rajkot,
it would not render the present proceedings under the NI Act
unsustainable in the eyes of law.
4.1    Learned advocate Mr. Pandya further submitted that the
order of the Division Bench of this Court in Special Civil
Application No.15137 of 2019, by which the orders passed by
the civil Court at Rajkot below Exhibits – 11 and 15 in
Execution Petition No. 10 of 2019 were quashed and set aside,
was passed on 16.10.2019. However, much before the said
order came to be passed, the parties had executed the
settlement agreement, i.e. Deed of Undertaking, on 07.04.2016,
which was the basis for the initiation of proceedings under the
NI Act. Therefore, the initiated of proceedings under Section
138 of the NI Act was legal and justified.
4.2    Learned       advocate   Mr.     Pandya     contended         that         the
applicant No.1 Company has committed default in making
payment of the goods that were delivered by the respondent-
complainant, which has not been disputed by the applicants
and it was in respect of such payment that the parties had
executed the settlement agreement dated 07.04.2016. Thus, the
cheque in question was issued against the legally enforceable
debt, which the respondent-complainant was entitled to receive
from the applicants. He pointed out that though the word
‘security’ has been used in the settlement agreement dated
07.04.2016, the same refers to the cheque being issued towards
repayment of instalment of outstanding amount. The repayment
becomes due under the settlement agreement once the terms of
the agreement are violated. In this case, the applicants had
failed    to     abide the terms    of     settlement   agreement             and
therefore, the dishonor of the cheque in question would fall
under Section 138 of the NI Act. Therefore, the cheque would
represent the outstanding liability. He submitted that the
applicants will have to adduce necessary evidence in trial to
show that the cheque in question was not issued against any
enforceable debt and the present proceedings under Section
482 of Cr.P.C. is not the appropriate remedy. He, therefore,
prayed that the present application deserves to be rejected.
4.3    In support of his submissions, learned advocate Mr.
Pandya placed reliance upon the decision of Apex Court in the
case of Sampelly Satyanarayana Rao v. Indian Renewable
Energy Development Agency Limited, (2016) 10 SCC 458 more
particularly, on the observations made in paragraphs – 9 and
13 to 16, which reads thus:
“9. We have given due consideration to the submission
advanced on behalf of the appellant as well as the observations of
this Court in Indus Airways (supra) with reference to the
explanation to Section 138 of the Act and the expression “for
discharge of any debt or other liability” occurring in Section 138
of the Act. We are of the view that the question whether a post-
dated cheque is for “discharge of debt or liability” depends on the
nature of the transaction. If on the date of the cheque liability or
debt exists or the amount has become legally recoverable, the
Section is attracted and not otherwise.
13. In Balaji Seafoods (supra), the High Court noted that the
cheque was not handed over with the intention of discharging the
subsisting liability or debt. There is, thus, no similarity in the facts
of that case simply because in that case also loan was advanced. It
was noticed specifically therein – as was the admitted case of the
parties – that the cheque was issued as “security” for the advance
and was not intended to be in discharge of the liability, as in the
present case.
14. In HMT Watches Ltd. versus M.A. Abida[8], relied upon on
behalf of the respondent, this Court dealt with the contention that
the proceedings under Section 138 were liable to be quashed as the
cheques were given as “security” as per defence of the accused.
Negativing the contention, this Court held : (SCC pp.779-80, paras
“10. Having heard the learned counsel for the parties, we
are of the view that the accused (Respondent 1) challenged
the proceedings of criminal complaint cases before the High
Court, taking factual defences. Whether the cheques were
given as security or not, or whether there was outstanding
liability or not is a question of fact which could have been
determined only by the trial court after recording evidence
of the parties. In our opinion, the High Court should not
have expressed its view on the disputed questions of fact in a
petition under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal
Procedure, to come to a conclusion that the offence is not
made out. The High Court has erred in law in going into the
factual aspects of the matter which were not admitted
between the parties. The High Court further erred in
observing that Section 138(b) of the NI Act stood
uncomplied with, even though Respondent 1 (accused) had
admitted that he replied to the notice issued by the
complainant. Also, the fact, as to whether the signatory of
demand notice was authorised by the complainant company
or not, could not have been examined by the High Court in
its jurisdiction under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal
Procedure when such plea was controverted by the
complainant before it.
11. In Suryalakshmi Cotton Mills Ltd. v. Rajvir Industries
Ltd. [(2008) 13 SCC 678], this Court has made the following
observations explaining the parameters of jurisdiction of the
High Court in exercising its jurisdiction under Section 482
of the Code of Criminal Procedure: (SCC pp. 685-87, paras
“17. The parameters of jurisdiction of the High Court
in exercising its jurisdiction under Section 482 of the
Code of Criminal Procedure is now well settled.
Although it is of wide amplitude, a great deal of
caution is also required in its exercise. What is
required is application of the well- known legal
principles involved in the matter.
22. Ordinarily, a defence of an accused although
appears to be plausible should not be taken into
consideration for exercise of the said jurisdiction. Yet
again, the High Court at that stage would not
ordinarily enter into a disputed question of fact. It,
however, does not mean that documents of
unimpeachable character should not be taken into
consideration at any cost for the purpose of finding
out as to whether continuance of the criminal
proceedings would amount to an abuse of process of
court or that the complaint petition is filed for causing
mere harassment to the accused. While we are not
oblivious of the fact that although a large number of
disputes should ordinarily be determined only by the
civil courts, but criminal cases are filed only for
achieving the ultimate goal, namely, to force the
accused to pay the amount due to the complainant
immediately. The courts on the one hand should not
encourage such a practice; but, on the other, cannot
also travel beyond its jurisdiction to interfere with the
proceeding which is otherwise genuine. The courts
cannot also lose sight of the fact that in certain
matters, both civil proceedings and criminal
proceedings would be maintainable.”
12. In Rallis India Ltd. v. Poduru Vidya Bhushan [(2011)
13 SCC 88], this Court expressed its views on this point as
under: (SCC p. 93, para 12)
“12. At the threshold, the High Court should not have
interfered with the cognizance of the complaints
having been taken by the trial court. The High Court
could not have discharged the respondents of the said
liability at the threshold. Unless the parties are given
opportunity to lead evidence, it is not possible to come
to a definite conclusion as to what was the date when
the earlier partnership was dissolved and since what
date the respondents ceased to be the partners of the
firm.”
15. We are in respectful agreement with the above observations.
In the present case, reference to the complaint (a copy of which is
Annexures P-7) shows that as per the case of the complainant, the
cheques which were subject matter of the said complaint were
towards the partial repayment of the dues under the loan
agreement (para 5 of the complaint).
16. As is clear from the above observations of this Court, it is
well settled that while dealing with a quashing petition, the Court
has ordinarily to proceed on the basis of averments in the
complaint. The defence of the accused cannot be considered at this
stage. The court considering the prayer for quashing does not
adjudicate upon a disputed question of fact.”
4.4    Reliance was also placed on a recent decision of the
Apex Court in the case of Sripati Singh (Since Deceased)
Through His Son Gaurav Singh v. The State of Jhardkhand
passed in Criminal Appeal Nos. 12691270 of 2021 decided on
28.10.2021 wherein similar principle has been laid down.
5.     Heard learned advocates on both the sides. From the
record of the case, it appears that the parties had business
relations since the year 2008. There does not appear any
controversy on the issue that the Registered Office of applicant
No.1, which is a Company incorporated under the Companies
Act, is situated in District : Nadiad. The applicant No.1
Company is also having its factory premises in District :
Nadiad. The respondent-complainant filed Special Summary
Suit No.23 of 2014 before the Court of learned Civil Judge,
Senior Division, Rajkot against applicant No.1 Company for
recovery of an amount of Rs.1,12,26,500/- with interest. The
said suit came to be decreed in favour of the respondent-
plaintiff vide judgment and order dated 07.05.2015. Against
the said judgment and decree, the applicant No.1-defendant
preferred First Appeal No.1730 of 2015 before this Court along
with an application seeking interim stay of the judgment and
decree. While admitting the said first appeal vide order dated
29.01.2016, the Division Bench of this Court granted interim
relief    in     favour of  applicant       No.1-Company        by      staying
operation and implemention of the judgment and decree dated
07.05.2015 on condition that applicant No.1-Company deposits
an amount of Rs.43,40,061/- before the trial Court within the
stipulated period and to furnish appropriate security to the
satisfaction of the trial Court for the remaining amount failing
which      the       interim  relief   was       ordered   to     get       vacated
6.     However, the applicants could not deposit the amount as
aforesaid and therefore, the respondent-complainant initiated
execution proceedings before the Court of learned Civil Judge,
Senior Division, Rajkot. In the execution proceedings, the
respondent-complainant           moved         an   application       Exhibit-11
seeking issuance of a Warrant of Attachment of the movable /
immovable properties of applicant No.1 Company. It appears
that before application Exhibit-11 could be adjudicated upon
on the date fixed for hearing, the respondent-decree holder
preferred another application vide Exhibit-15 seeking similar
relief on an earlier date. Without affording any opportunity of
hearing      to     applicant  No.1-Company,          the   executing           Court
allowed application Exhibit-15 vide order dated 22.03.2016.
7.     Against the said order dated 22.03.2016, the applicant
No.1-Company preferred a writ petition before this Court in
Special Civil Application No.7417 of 2016. While granting ad-
interim relief in favour of applicant No.1-Company at the time
of issuing Notice in the writ petition, the learned Single Judge
“1. Prima facie, it appears that the respondent – decree
holder moved an application below Exh.11 in Special
Execution Petition No.24 of 2015 with a request to issue
warrant for attachment of movable/immovable properties of
the petitioner. The said application was kept for hearing
on 12.04.2016. On 22.03.2016, the respondent – decree
holder made an application to take the matter on board
and presented an application below Exh.15 for identical
relief, as prayed for, in application Exh.11. It seems that
copy of application Exh.15 was provided to the learned
advocate appearing for the petitioner but, the learned
Executing Court has not heard any submissions of the
petitioner nor granted any time and, in his absence,
passed order below Exh.15. Upon perusal of Rojkam
submitted by learned advocate for the petitioner, which
is ordered to be taken on record, it appears that learned
advocate for the petitioner was not present when order
below Exh.15 has been passed and thus, the impugned
order has been passed without extending any
opportunity to the petitioner.
2.       Apart from it, it is a matter of fact that the decree under
execution was passed by the competent Court at Rajkot
whereas, warrant issued by the learned trial Judge as per
order dated 22.03.2016 came to be executed for attachment
of movable/immovable properties situated at Nadiad. Thus,
considering the provisions of Section 39(4) of the Code of
Civil Procedure, the learned Executing Court is not
authorized to issue such warrant for executing the decree
against any property outside the local limits of its jurisdiction.
Admittedly, warrant issued pursuant to application Exh.15
came to be executed in respect of properties situated at
Nadiad and, therefore, present petition deserves
consideration. Hence, issue notice to the respondent for final
disposal, making it returnable on 26.07.2016. Meanwhile, ad-
interim relief in terms of para 18(B) is granted. Direct service
is permitted. The learned advocate for the petitioner is
permitted to file additional documents with the Registry of
7.1    The aforesaid writ petition was disposed of by the
learned Single Judge of this Court vide order dated 18.11.2016.
The relevant paragraphs of the order reads as under:
“2. Learned advocate Mr.Nilesh Pandya appearing for learned
advocate Mr.H.H. Patel for the respondent, upon instructions,
states at bar that the order passed below Exh.15 may be quashed
and set aside and the learned trial Judge may be directed to hear
application Exhs.11 and 15 moved in Special Execution Petition
No.24 of 2015 afresh and pass appropriate order after hearing
both sides.
3.       As against this, learned advocate Mr.S.M. Thakore for the
petitioner makes a request that the petitioner has issued cheque for
a sum of Rs.10 lacs pursuant to order passed by the learned
Executing Court on 22.03.2016 and that, the amount received
through the said cheque and other cheques obtained during the
course of execution of decree, more particularly, placed on record
at page Nos.79 to 82 to the present petition, may be ordered to be
returned back to the petitioner.
4.       In light of the statement made at bar, order dated
22.03.2016 passed by the learned 12th Additional Senior Civil
Judge, Rajkot below Exh.15 in Special Execution Petition No.24
of 2015 is hereby quashed and set aside and the learned
Executing Court is directed to decide application Exhs.11 and 15
afresh and pass appropriate order after hearing both sides. So far
as request to return the amount of cheque is concerned, the said
request is kept open to be agitated before the learned Executing
Court. The learned Executing Court is directed to consider such
request while deciding application Exhs.11 and 15 afresh.
Meanwhile, the respondent shall not deposit the cheques issued by
the petitioner for execution of decree till final disposal of
application Exhs.11 and 15.
5.       It is made clear that this Court has not examined application
Exhs.11 and 15 on merits and the learned Executing Court shall
decide the same on merits uninfluenced by the observations
recorded in the impugned order as well as concessional statement
made at bar by the learned advocate appearing for the respondent.
Not only that, the learned Executing Court shall pass appropriate
order of refund of cheque amounts realized while executing
order dated 22.03.2016 and also order to return unrealized
cheques to the petitioner, if application Exhs.11 and 15 are
decided in favour of the petitioner.
6.       In view of the above observation and direction, present
petition stands disposed of. Direct service is permitted.”
7.2    From the above order passed by the coordinate Bench of
this Court in Special Civil Application No.7417 of 2016, it is
clear that the executing Court at Rajkot was required to
adjudicate both the applications Exhibits 11 and 15 afresh. It
was specifically brought to the notice of the executing Court at
Rajkot that the decree under execution was passed by the civil
Court at Rajkot whereas, the warrant has been issued for
attachment of movable / immovable properties situated at
Nadiad, which the executing Court at Rajkot was not legally
authorized to do. Issuance of warrant of attachment in respect
of any property situated outside the local limits of jurisdiction
is barred in view of the provisions of Section 39(4) of the
Code of Civil Procedure and hence, the executing Court at
Rajkot was directed to examine the matter afresh. This Court
had also directed the executing Court at Rajkot to pass
appropriate orders for the refund of cheque amounts realized
while executing the order dated 22.03.2016 and also to return
the unrealized cheques to applicant No.1-Company.
7.3    It was in the aforesaid background that the executing
Court at Rajkot was required to consider applications Exhibits
– 11 and 15 preferred in Execution Petition No. 10 of 2019
afresh. However, while considering the matter afresh, the
executing       Court    at  Rajkot    appears      to   have     ignored           the
observations made by this Court in Special Civil Application
No.7417 of 2016 and passed the order dated 20.08.2019 below
applications Exhibits – 11 and 15 whereby, it stood by its
earlier order dated 22.03.2016.
8.     It appears that pursuant to the passing of the order dated
20.08.2019 by the executing Court at Rajkot, the respondent-
complainant deposited the cheque in question with the Bank
on     06.09.2019,        which     got       returned     on       07.09.2019.
Indisputably, the cheque in question was given as ‘security’ by
the applicant No.1-Company, which has been stated in the
Deed of Undertaking dated 07.04.2016 in unequivocal terms.
9.     Against       the  order  dated       20.08.2019      passed        by       the
executing Court at Rajkot below applications Exhibits – 11 and
15 in Execution Petition No.10 of 2019, the applicant No.1-
Company preferred Special Civil Application No.15137 of 2019
before this Court. By way of judgment and order dated
26.10.2019, the Division Bench of this Court allowed the writ
petition     by quashing       and setting        aside   the     order dated
20.08.2019 passed by the executing Court at Rajkot.
10.    From the above set of facts, it is clear that the earlier
order dated 22.03.2016 passed by the executing Court at
Rajkot below application Exhibit-15 was quashed and set aside
by the coordinate Bench of this Court vide order passed in
Special Civil Application No.7417 of 2016 dated 18.11.2016
and the matter was remanded to the executing Court at Rajkot
for   consideration  afresh.  The       executing   Court       at       Rajkot
considered the matter afresh; however, it stood by the
conclusion arrived at in its earlier order dated 22.03.2016 by
passing the order dated 20.08.2019 below applications Exhibits
– 11 and 15. The said order dated 20.08.2019 was assailed
before this Court in Special Civil Application No.15137 of 2019
and by judgment and order dated 16.10.2019, the subsequent
order dated 20.08.2019 passed by the executing Court at
Rajkot was quashed and set aside by the Division Bench of this
Court. Thus, both the orders dated 22.03.2016 and 20.08.2019
passed by the executing Court at Rajkot below Exhibits – 11 &
15 were quashed and set aside by this Court after recording
elaborate reasons. This would render the initiation of all
proceedings, including the issuance of Warrant of Attachment
dated 31.03.2016 and the subsequent execution of the Deed of
Undertaking dated 07.04.2016 in the presence of the Court
Bailiff, as baseless because the very source of the issuance of
the Warrant of Attachment being the orders passed below
applications Exhibits – 11 & 15 have been quashed and set
aside by this Court in both rounds of litigation. When the
orders below applications Exhibits – 11 & 15 have been
quashed       and    set  aside  by    this   Court,   the     Warrant            of
Attachment and all consequential proceedings, including the
Deed of Undertaking dated 07.04.2016, would not have any
legal basis.
11.      Coming to the proceedings initiated under the NI Act, it
is not in dispute that the cheque in question was given as
‘security’. The Deed of Undertaking dated 07.04.2016 executed
by and between the parties in the presence of the Court Bailiff
lays down the terms and conditions of payment. It specifically
mentions that the cheque in question has been been given as
‘security’ and also lays down the conditions as to when the
said cheque shall be deposited. It is a settled proposition of
law that proceedings under Section 138 of the NI Act would
lie only in respect of any ‘enforceable debt’.
11.1            In the case of Lalit Kumar Sharma v. State of Uttar
Pradesh, 2008 (5) SCC 638, the facts were that a Company,
named M/s. Mediline India (P) Ltd. had taken loan of Rs.5
Lacs from the complainant. Against the said loan, two cheques
for Rs.3 Lacs and Rs.2 Lacs were issued in favour of the
complainant. On presentation, both the cheques were returned
upaid with the remarks - “insufficient funds”. Therefore, a
complaint under Section 138 of the N.I. Act and other sections
came to be filed. It was the say of the appellants that they
were not signatories to the cheques and that on the date when
the two cheques were issued, they had already resigned from
the post of directorship of the Company. During the pendency
of the complaint, the parties appeared to have arrived at some
compromise whereof, it was agreed that if a cheque of
Rs.5,02,050/-        is issued,  then       the complaint       would           be
withdrawn. Pursuant thereto, a cheque of such amount dated
29.07.2000 was issued in favour of the complainant; however,
on presentation, it was returned with the remarks “insufficient
funds”. The complainant filed another complaint with regard
to return of cheque dated 29.07.2000 not only against the
erstwhile Directors but also against the present appellants. On
the above facts, the Apex Court held that the second cheque
dated 29.07.2000 was issued in terms of the compromise and it
did not create a new liability and therefore, the same cannot
be said to have been issued towards payment of debt, even if
the compromise had not fructified.
11.2            In the present case also, evidently, the cheque in
question was given as ‘security’ and not in respect of any
‘enforceable debt’, which the applicant No.1-Company was
required to pay to the respondent-complainant. In paragraph-1
of the complaint filed under Section 138 of the NI Act, the
respondent-complainant itself has stated that the cheque in
question has been given in view of the compromise arrived at
between the parties. Thus, as per the admission of the
complainant also, the cheque in question was not issued in
respect of any ‘enforceable debt’, which the applicant No.1-
Company was required to pay to the respondent-complainant.
Considering the aforesaid factual aspects and in view of the
principle laid down in Lalit Kumar Sharma’s case (supra), the
impugned proceedings initiated under the provisions of the NI
Act deserves to be quashed and set aside.
11.3 While disposing Special Civil Application No.7417 of 2016
vide order dated 18.11.2016, this Court had observed that the
executing Court shall pass appropriate orders for the refund of
cheque       amounts     realized    while      executing      order          dated
22.03.2016 and also order to return the unrealized cheques to
the applicants, if the applications Exhibits - 11 and 15 are
decided in favour of the applicants. Now when the order dated
20.08.2019 passed by the Court of learned Principal Senior
Civil Judge, Rajkot was quashed and set aside by the Division
Bench of this Court in Special Civil Application No.15137 of
2019, the holding of the cheque in question by the respondent-
complainant in connection with the proceedings under Section
138 of the NI Act would be illegal. Under the circumstances,
the respondent-complainant ought to have returned the cheque
in    question       to the   applicant       No.1-Company        instead           of
depositing the same. In the considered opinion of this Court, if
the proceedings under the N.I. Act are permitted to continue,
it would lead to gross miscarriage of justice and abuse of the
process of Court.
12.    For the foregoing reasons, the application is allowed. The
impugned          order dated 18.11.2019 passed by the Court of
learned 13th Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate, Rajkot below
Exhibit-1 in Criminal Case No.16873 of 2019 as also the
complaint filed by respondent No.2 under section 138 of the
NI Act being Criminal Case No.16873 of 2019 are quashed and
set aside. Rule is made absolute. In view of the above order,
both the civil applications stand disposed of.
After the judgment was pronounced, learned advocate
Mr. Nilesh Pandya for the respondent-complainant requested to
stay the operation of this judgment for a period of six weeks
in order to approach the higher forum. The said request is
accepted and hence, the operation of this judgment shall
remain stayed for a period of six weeks from today. It is
clarified that after the expiry of the above period, this
judgment shall come into operation or shall remain subject to
the orders that may be passed by the higher forum.
