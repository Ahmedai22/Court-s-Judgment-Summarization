For the respondent             :       Mr. Surender Sharma, Advocate.
By way of instant petition, petitioner has assailed
order dated 07.03.2020, passed by learned Principal Judge
Family Court, Chamba, District Chamba, H.P. in Petition No.
ig  h94 of 2019, whereby petitioner herein has been directed to
pay maintenance @ Rs. 2,500/- per month to the respondent
herein from the date of filing of the petition i.e. 31.03.2016.
H    2.              Respondent          sought        maintenance
petitioner claiming himself to be his son. It was alleged that
respondent was born out of relationship that, once, existed
between the petitioner and mother of the respondent.
1        Whether reporters of the local papers may be allowed to see the judgment?
3.            Petitioner     denied    the     allegations.       He     denied
himself to be the father of the respondent. He even denied
his relationship with the mother of the respondent.
framed following points for determination:-
1. Whether the respondent has not provided any
maintenance to the petitioner being his minor child?
2. If Point No.1 is proved in affirmative, as to what
amount of maintenance the petitioner is entitled to?
3. Final order.
ou  After   recording      the   evidence
respondent has been held entitled to maintenance from the
of   the     parties,
rtI have heard learned counsel for the parties and
also gone through the record.
7.            Petitioner has assailed the impugned order on the
ground that petitioner has been fastened with the liability to
pay maintenance to the respondent without their being any
H   evidence on record to prove such entitlement. Learned
counsel for the petitioner contended that the petitioner was
not proved to be father of the respondent and hence, the
impugned      order    was      unsustainable.        As    per     petitioner,
respondent was neither his legitimate nor illegitimate son.
8.         The mother of the respondent          entered into the
witness box and made categoric allegations against the
petitioner. She alleged that she had fallen in love with the
petitioner, who had kept her as a mistress. She further stated
on oath that      petitioner had maintained      physical relation
with her, as a result of which she conceived and ultimately
delivered a baby boy. i.e. the respondent. On the other hand,
petitioner denied all such allegations. He, besides examining
himself also examined his wife Smt. Manju Devi to support
his contention.
after analyzing    the evidence came to the conclusion that
respondent had been able to establish his case. Version put
forward by the mother of respondent was believed. Reliance
was also placed on document Ext. PW2/A, which was a copy
of immunization certificate of respondent.
10.         During the course of proceedings before learned
H   Principal Judge, Family Court, Chamba, an application was
moved on behalf of the respondent for conducting the DNA
test in order to establish his paternity. Petitioner opposed
such prayer by filing a response. Learned Principal Judge,
Family Court, Chamba, however, held that since there was
sufficient proof regarding paternity of the respondent on
record, there was no need to conduct the DNA test of the
respondent.
The statement of mother of the respondent
regarding the paternity of respondent cannot be brushed
aside easily. It is hard to believe that a female would name
any unknown person to be the father of her son. Contest by
petitioner to the prayer for DNA test strengthens the claim of
the respondent. It would have been more appropriate for
petitioner to agree for DNA test, as his fidelity towards his
wife and sincerity towards his children was at stake. Keeping
in view the dependability of DNA test, petitioner         could have
availed the opportunity to prove the allegation against him
wrong. On the other hand, respondent and for that matter his
mother had stepped forward with a prayer            for conduct of
DNA test. The circumstance noticed above, is sufficient to
draw adverse inference against the petitioner.
H   12.        Even otherwise, the findings recorded by learned
Principle Judge, Family Court, Chamba, are borne from the
available records. The view taken by learned Principal Judge,
Family Court, Chamba, cannot be said to be perverse, rather,
it is a possible view based on the material on record. The
quantum of maintenance also cannot be said to be excessive
on the basis of material on record.
13.        In light of above discussion, there is no merit in
the petition and the same is dismissed.
