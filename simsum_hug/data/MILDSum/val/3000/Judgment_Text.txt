1.       Rule. Rule made returnable forthwith and, with the consent of
the counsels for the parties, heard finally.
This petition under Article 227 of the Constitution of India
calls in question the legality, propriety and correctness of an order
passed by the learned Additional Sessions Judge, Pune on 3 rd
September, 2021 on an application (Exhibit 20), in Sessions Case
No. 188 of 2019 whereby the prayer of the petitioner to discharge
him from the prosecution came to be rejected.
2.       The background facts necessary for determination of this
petition can be stated as under:
a]       Ms. S (hereinafter referred to as “prosecutrix”) is an actress
by profession. Her marriage was solemnized on 21 st November,
2002. However, in the year 2004, the said marriage was dissolved
by mutual consent. One of the friends of the prosecutrix introduced
the petitioner to her. In the year 2008, the petitioner represented to
her that he would assist her in procuring a flat at Mumbai under
Government’s 10% discretionary quota. The petitioner induced the
prosecutrix to part with a sum of Rs. 8 lakhs allegedly for payment
to the middlemen. The flat could not be allotted till the month of
March/April, 2010. The petitioner repaid a sum of Rs. 5 lakhs. The
petitioner, however, developed intimacy with the prosecutrix.
b]       In June, 2010 the petitioner proposed the prosecutrix. The
petitioner represented that he was a bachelor. The petitioner met
the mother and brother of the prosecutrix and gained their
confidence as well. After the prosecutrix and her family members
agreed to the said proposal, the marriage of the prosecutrix was
solemnized with the petitioner on 23rd July, 2010 at Kita Cottage,
Varsova, Andheri(w). Pre-marriage ceremonies were held at Flat
No. 901, Pyramid Towers, Varsova, Andheri(w), which was taken on
rent. None from the family members of the petitioner attended the
said marriage. The petitioner claimed that since the marriage was
inter caste, his family members did not attend the same.
c]       In the month of September, 2010 a lady “M” called the
prosecutrix and informed her that she was the wife of the petitioner
and they had two issues out of the said wedlock. When confronted,
the petitioner stated that the previous marriage was dissolved. The
petitioner assured to show the divorce papers and also get the
certificate of marriage with prosecutrix. In the meanwhile, the
petitioner made the prosecutrix to open a joint account with ICICI
Bank, Andheri branch, and withdrew huge amounts from the said
account behind the back of the prosecutrix.
d]       On 23rd July, 2010 the prosecutrix and the petitioner
celebrated their first marriage Anniversary at Hotel Tunga, Andheri
(E), Mumbai. The said event was reported in newspapers. “M” came
to the house of the prosecutrix. In her presence, the petitioner
conceded that the documents evidencing the alleged divorce
between him and “M”, which he had shown to the prosecutrix, were
false. The petitioner claimed that he would ensure that separate
provision was made for her first wife and children.
e]       Prosecutrix and her mother met the parents of the petitioner.
It transpired that the petitioner had deceived them by firstly
representing that he was a bachelor and, later on, claiming that his
first marriage was dissolved. The petitioner had allegedly obtained a
forged marriage certificate as well. The prosecutrix thus instituted a
petition for annulment of marriage in the Family Court, Pune.
3.       The prosecutrix, thereafter, approached Dattwadi police
station, Pune and lodged report leading to registration of C.R. No.
148 of 2013 for the offences punishable under sections 420, 406,
467, 471, 474, 376, 323, 504, 506(i) and 494 of Indian Penal Code,
1860. Post completion of investigation, charge-sheet came to be
lodged against the petitioner.
4.       The   petitioner preferred    an  application   for discharge
contending, inter alia, that the prosecutrix had made false and
baseless allegations against the petitioner. Those allegations were
vague. No specific date, time and place was mentioned with regard
to any of the events which allegedly transpired. Moreover, the
version of the prosecutrix was at variance with the averments in
the petition for annulment of marriage. There was an inordinate
delay of more than three years in lodging the first information
report. Thus, the charge against the petitioner was groundless.
Therefore, the petitioner deserved to be discharged.
5.       The application was resisted by the prosecution.
6.       The learned Additional Sessions Judge, after apprisal of the
contentions in the application, reply thereto and the report under
section 173 of the Code of Criminal Procedure and the documents
annexed with it as well as the submissions canvassed across the bar,
was persuaded to reject the application. The learned Additional
Sessions Judge was of the view that there were sufficient grounds to
proceed against the petitioner.
7.       Being aggrieved, the petitioner has invoked the writ
jurisdiction of this Court.
8.       I have heard Mr. Purwant, learned counsel for the petitioner,
Mr. Patil, learned APP for the State and Ms. Kantawala, learned
counsel for respondent No. 2/prosecutrix. With the assistance of the
learned counsel for the parties, I have perused the material on
record including the report under section 173 of the Code and the
documents annexed with it.
9.       Mr. Purwant, learned counsel for the applicant, canvassed a
two-fold submission. Firstly, the claim of the prosecutrix that her
marriage was solemnized with the petitioner is required to be
repelled for the reason that there is no material to show that the
marriage between the prosecutrix and her husband, solemnized in
the year 2002, was legally dissolved. This negatives the very
premise of the prosecution case that the petitioner obtained the
consent of the prosecutrix by falsely representing that he was
unmarried and thereby committed the offence of cheating and rape.
Secondly, in any event, the offence punishable under section 376 of
the Penal Code cannot be said to have been made out, by any stretch
of imagination. The allegations in the first information report as well
as the averments in the petition for annulment of marriage,
according to Mr. Purwant, do not indicate even remotely that the
alleged physical relations between the prosecutrix and the
petitioner were without the consent of the prosecutrix. Mr. Purwant
would further urge that if the offence punishable under section 376
of the Penal Code is held to be prima facie not made out, then the
trial would be required to be held by the Court of learned
Magistrate. The learned Sessions Judge did not properly appreciate
this aspect of the offence punishable under section 376 of the Penal
Code not having been prima facie made out and rejected the
application by making general observations that there were
sufficient grounds to proceed against the petitioner, submitted Mr.
10.      In order to lend support to the aforesaid submissions, Mr.
Purwant took the Court through the allegations in the first
information report and the averments in the petition for annulment
of marriage. An endevour was made to compare and contrast the
allegations in the first information report and the averments in the
petition and highlight the inconsistency therein. Mr. Purwant,
would further urge that in the written statement to the said
Marriage Petition, the petitioner has categorically asserted that the
marriage ceremony purported to be held on 23rd July, 2010 and the
anniversary celebration, the following year, were merely props as
the prosecutrix had induced the petitioner to perform the role of
‘husband’ for a programme to be aired. As the petitioner was fond of
film and TV industry, the petitioner performed those roles and, in
fact, the petitioner and the prosecutrix were never married and
cohabited as husband and wife.
11.      The learned APP, countered the submissions of Mr. Purwant.
Laying emphasis on the material on record, especially the
statements      of  witnesses, who    attended   the  marriage      and
anniversary, the documents evidencing hiring of the premises on
Leave and Licence, bank statements and photographs, the learned
APP would urge that there is overwhelming material to lend support
to the allegations in the first information report. At this stage, the
defence of the petitioner is not required to taken into account at all,
submitted learned APP.
12.      Ms. Kantawala, the learned counsel for respondent No. 2 at
the outset, submitted that the instant petition does not deserve to be
entertained as the learned Sessions Judge has framed charge
against the applicant on 14th October, 2021, after the application for
discharge came to be dismissed on 3rd September, 2021. In view of
the aforesaid development, the challenge to the impugned order
becomes unsustainable as the prayer for discharge cannot be
countenanced after the framing of the charge.
13.        Ms. Aishwarya Kantawala, submitted that the very premise
of the petitioner that the marriage ceremony and the anniversary
celebrations were mere props, renders the application for discharge
untenable. In the face of the allegations in the first information
report and overwhelming documentary evidence, this issue would
surely warrant a trial. Ms. Kantawala further submitted that the
thrust of the submission on behalf of the petitioner that, in any
event the offence punishable under section 376 of the Penal Code
cannot be said to have been made out, is based on an incorrect
impression of the definition of “rape”. The case at hand, according to
Ms. Kantawala, would clearly fall within the ambit of clause
“fourthly” as the petitioner being a married man had fully known
that he was not the husband of the prosecutrix and made her to give
consent believing that he is the man to whom she is lawfully
married. Therefore, the offence punishable under section 376 of the
Penal Code is prima facie made out. Resultantly, the learned
Additional Sessions Judge committed no error in rejecting the
application, submitted Ms. Kantawala.
14.      The challenge to the tenability of the petition, in the context of
its frame and the prayers therein, on the count of the framing of the
charge cannot be said to be bereft of substance. It seems that after
the application came to be rejected, on the next scheduled date the
learned Sessions Judge framed charge against the petitioner and
the petitioner abjured the guilt. Copies of the order framing charge
and the plea of the petitioner are annexed to the affidavit filed on
behalf of the respondent No. 2. It is trite that once a charge is
framed, the scope of interference by the High Court, even in
exercise of extraordinary writ jurisdiction, gets constricted. A
proper remedy for an accused aggrieved by framing of the charge is
to invoke the revisional jurisdiction. Indeed, the existence of an
alternative remedy is a self-imposed restraint. Yet, after the
framing of the charge, the High Court may not interdict the trial
unless the exercise of the jurisdiction becomes, in the peculiar facts
of a given case, absolutely imperative to prevent the abuse of the
process of the Court and secure the ends of justice.
15.        In this context, Ms. Kantawala placed reliance on a judgment
of the Supreme Court in the case of Minakshi Bala vs. Sudhir Kumar
and Others1. Paragraph 7 reads as under:-
7] If charges are framed in accordance with Section 240
CrPC on a finding that a prima facie case has been made
out as has been done in the instant case the person
arraigned may, if he feels aggrieved, invoke the
revisional jurisdiction of the High Court or the Sessions
Judge to contend that the charge-sheet submitted under
Section 173 CrPC and documents sent with it did not
disclose any ground to presume that he had committed
any offence for which he is charged and the revisional
court if so satisfied can quash the charges framed against
him. To put it differently, once charges are framed under
Section 240 CrPC the High Court in its revisional
jurisdiction would not be justified in relying upon
documents other than those referred to in Sections 239
and 240 CrPC; nor would it be justified in invoking its
inherent jurisdiction under Section 482 CrPC to quash
the same except in those rare cases where forensic
exigencies and formidable compulsions justify such a
course. We hasten to add even in such exceptional cases
the High Court can look into only those documents which
are unimpeachable and can be legally translated into
relevant evidence.
16.      Nonetheless in the context of the challenge, especially to the
invocation of the provisions contained in section 376 of the Penal
Code, I deem it expedient to appreciate the submissions keeping in
view the broad parameters on which a prayer for discharge from
prosecution is required to be appraised.
17.      A profitable reference in this context can be made to the
judgment of the Supreme Court in the case of Union of India vs.
Prafulla Kumar Samal and Another2.                        The observations in
paragraph Nos. 8 and 10 are instructive and hence extracted below:
8] The scope of section 227 of the Code was
considered by a recent decision of this Court in the
case of State of Bihar v. Ramesh Singh(1) where
Untwalia, J. speaking for the Court observed as
"Strong suspicion against the accused, if the
matter remains in the region of suspicion, cannot
take the place of proof of his guilt at the conclusion
of the trial. But at the initial stage if there is a
strong suspicion which leads the Court to think that
there is ground for presuming that the accused has
committed an offence then it is not open to the
Court to say that there is no sufficient ground for
proceeding against the accused. The presumption of
the guilt of the accused which is to be drawn at the
initial stage is not in the sense of the law governing
the trial of criminal cases in France where the
accused is presumed to be guilty unless the
contrary is proved. But it is only for the purpose of
deciding prima facie whether the Court should
proceed with the trial or not. If the evidence which
the Prosecutor pro poses to adduce to prove the
guilt of the accused even if fully accepted before it is
challenged in cross-examination or rebut ted by the
defence evidence; if any, cannot show that the
accused committed the offence then there will be no
sufficient ground for proceeding with the trial".
This Court has thus held that whereas strong
suspicion may not take the place of the proof at the
trial stage, yet it may be sufficient for the
satisfaction of ths Sessions Judge in order to frame
a charge against the accused. Even under the Code
of 1898 this Court has held that a committing
Magistrate had ample powers to weigh the evidence
for the limited purpose of finding out whether or not
a case of commitment to the Sessions Judge has
been made out.
10] Thus, on a consideration of the authorities
mentioned above, the following principles emerge:
(1) That the Judge while considering the question of
framing the charges under section 227 of the Code
has the undoubted power to sift and weigh the
evidence for the limited purpose of finding out
whether or not a prima facie case against the
accused has been made out.
(2) Where the materials placed before the Court
disclose grave suspicion against the accused which
has not been properly explained the Court will be,
fully justified in framing a charge and proceeding
with the trial.
(3) The test to determine a prima facie case would
naturally depend upon the facts of each case and it
is difficult to lay down a rule of universal
application. By and large however if two views are
equally possible and the Judge is satisfied that the
evidence produced before him while giving rise to
some suspicion but not grave suspicion against the
accused, he will be fully within his right to discharge
the accused.
(4) That in exercising his jurisdiction under section
227 of the Code the Judge which under the present
Code is a senior and experienced Judge cannot act
merely as a Post office or a mouth-piece of the
prosecution, but has to consider the broad
probabilities of the case, the total effect of the
evidence and the documents produced before the
Court, any basic infirmities appearing in the case
and so on. This however does not mean that the
Judge should make a roving enquiry into the pros
and cons of the matter and weigh the evidence as if
he was conducting a trial.
18.          On the aforesaid touchstone, reverting to the facts of the
case, I find it rather difficult to accede to the submissions on behalf
of the petitioner that there is no material in support of the
allegations of the prosecutrix that the petitioner made her to go
through the ceremony of marriage, they resided together as
husband and wife and there was a marriage anniversary
celebration. In addition to the statement of the relatives of the
prosecutrix, there are statement of witnesses, who attended the
marriage ceremony, including the statement of the Manager of the
Hall where the marriage ceremony was allegedly held and the Priest
who solemnized the marriage. To add to this the statement of Dr.
Murari Nanawati, indicates that the petitioner and the prosecutrix
had visited his clinic and consulted him in respect of starting a
family. There are medical reports which prima facie lend support to
the claim of Dr. Nanawati. As indicated above, the prosecution has
collected copies of the leave and licence agreement in respect of the
premises which was allegedly taken on rent by the petitioner to
cohabit with the prosecutrix, post marriage. The extract of the joint
account maintained by the petitioner and prosecutrix is also
pressed into service in support of the allegations.
19.      In the face of the aforesaid material, at this juncture, it would
be impermissible to discard the prosecution version on the ground
that the petitioner has put forth a counter version, in his written
statement to the Marriage Petition. Indeed it is a matter for trial.
The necessary corollary of the aforesaid inference which, in the
circumstances of the case, appears at this stage irresistible is that
the question as to whether the petitioner forged the marriage
certificate and other documents is also a matter for evidence and
trial. I am, therefore, not persuaded to accede to the submission on
behalf of the petitioner that even the offences other than the offence
punishable under section 376 of the Penal Code are not prima facie
made out.
20.      This propels me to the pivotal challenge mounted on behalf of
the applicant. Mr. Purwant urged with a degree of vehemence that
since the prosecutrix has instituted a petition for annulment of
marriage before the Family Court, by no stretch of imagination can
it be said that the physical relations were without the consent of the
prosecutrix. Amplifying the submission, Mr. Purwant would urge
that if the Family Court rules that the marriage was valid, the
prosecution under section 376 of the Penal Code would be wholly
unsustainable. In no circumstances, according to Mr. Purwant, the
physical relations, in the backdrop of the case where the
prosecutrix alleges that she was induced to solemnize the marriage
by making a false representation that the petitioner was a bachelor,
can be said to be without the consent of the prosecutrix. Therefore,
the learned Session Judge committed a grave error in not
discharging the petitioner from the prosecution at least for the
offence punishable under section 376 of the Penal Code, submitted
21.      I     have   given   anxious  consideration    to  the aforesaid
submission. At the first blush, the submission appears attractive.
The submission, however, losses sight of the elements which vitiate
the consent of a woman for the sexual act. Clause ‘fourthly’ to
section 375 of the Penal Code addresses a situation where though
the sexual act is with the apparent consent of the prosecutrix, in
law the consent is vitiated on account of the circumstances
enumerated therein which have the effect of negating the consent.
Clause fourthly reads as under:-
Fourthly :- With her consent, when the man knows
that he is not her husband, and that her consent is
given because she believes that he is another man to
whom she is or believes herself to be lawfully
married.
22.      From the text of clause fourthly, it becomes abundantly clear
that the act with the apparent consent would fall within the dragnet
of offence of rape if the man knows that -
b) the woman gave consent because she believed that he is
another man to whom she is or believes herself to be lawfully
married.
23.      To bring the sexual act within the mischief of clause fourthly,
two states of mind are necessary. First, a state of mind on the part
of the man manifested in the knowledge that he is not the husband
of the prosecutrix and that the consent is given under a mistaken
belief. Second, the state of mind of the prosecutrix manifested in her
belief that she is lawfully or believes herself to be lawfully married
to the man.
24.      From the point of view of the prosecutrix, her belief as to her
situation in life qua the man, accused of committing the rape, is of
decisive significance. This belief, in turn, ought to be induced by a
positive act on the part of the man to make her believe that she is
married to him. If there is evidence to show the existence of
circumstances which made the prosecutrix to entertain such belief,
then clause fourthly would be attracted as the aspect of knowledge
on the part of the man that he is not her husband is often an
objective fact. To put it in other words, clause fourthly is attracted
where there is knowledge on the part of the man about he being not
the husband of the prosecutrix and the consent is on account of
such mistaken belief that he is her husband and a belief on the part
of the prosecutrix that she is the wife of the man. If the aforesaid
twin conditions are prima facie made out then the challenge to the
prosecution on the ground that the physical relations were with the
consent of the prosecutrix does not merit acceptance.
25.      In the case at hand the prosecutrix categorically alleges that
the petitioner made her to solemnize the marriage and cohabit with
her by making a representation that he is unmarried. Since the
petitioner allegedly solemnized the marriage with the prosecutrix,
during the life of his wife, the marriage was, thus, void. The
petitioner knew that he is not the husband of the prosecutrix and
yet allegedly had physical relations with her. In the circumstances
of the case, prima facie, the submission on behalf of the respondent
No. 2 that the prosecutrix would not have given consent but for the
belief induced by the petitioner by falsely representing that he was
unmarried (though much married) appears to carry substance.
26.      Reliance by Ms. Kantawala on a judgment of the Supreme
Court in the case of Bhupinder Singh vs. Union of Territory of
Chandigarh3 appears to be well placed. In the said case also, the
appellant therein, who was already married and had children from
the wedlock had induced the prosecutrix to enter into a marriage
ceremony and cohabit with him. Later on, the fact that the appellant
was already married and the first marriage was subsisting when the
appellant         went     through    the marriage     ceremony     with       the
prosecutrix came to light. In the backdrop of the said facts a
submission was sought to be canvassed that the physical relations
were with the consent of the prosecutrix and, therefore, the offence
punishable under section 376 cannot be said to have been made out.
27.      Repelling the submission, the Supreme Court enunciated the
13] Learned counsel for the accused-appellant
submitted that when the complainant knew that he
was a married man and yet consented for sexual
intercourse with him, Clause "Fourthly" of Section 375
IPC would have no application. It was also submitted
that the fact that the complainant knew about his
being a married man, is clearly established from the
averments made in a suit filed by her where she had
sought for a declaration that she is the wife of the
accused. The sentence imposed is stated to be harsh. It
was, however, pointed out that the compensation, as
awarded by the High Court, has been deposited and
withdrawn by the complainant.
14] Learned counsel for the State submitted that it is a
clear case where Clause "Fourthly" of Section 375 IPC
is applicable. Learned counsel for the complainant
submitted that this was a case where no reduction in
sentence was uncalled for. The High Court proceeded
on an erroneous impression that the complainant knew
that the accused was a married man. It was also
submitted that the compensation as awarded, is on the
lower side.
15] Clause "Fourthly" of Section 375 IPC reads as
"375 Rape - A man is said to commit "rape", who,
except in the case hereinafter excepted, has sexual
intercourse with a woman under circumstances falling
under any of the six following descriptions:-
Fourthly - With her consent, when the man knows that
he is not her husband, and that her consent is given
because she believes that he is another man to whom
she is or believes herself to be lawfully married.
16] Though it is urged with some amount of vehemence
that when complainant knew that he was a married
man, Clause "Fourthly" of Section 375 IPC has no
application, the stand is clearly without substance.
Even though, the complainant claimed to have married
the accused, which fact is established from several
documents, that does not improve the situation so far
as the accused-appellant is concerned. Since, he was
already married, the subsequent marriage, if any, has
no sanctity in law and is void ab-initio. In any event,
the accused-appellant could not have lawfully married
the complainant. A bare reading of Clause "Fourthly" of
Section 375 IPC makes this position clear.
28.      The aforesaid pronouncement was followed by the Delhi High
Court in the case of Divya Oram Kujur vs. State and Anr.4 wherein in
somewhat similar fact-situation, the Delhi High Court had interfered
4   Cri. Revn. Petition No. 193 of 2012 Dt.27.02.2013
with the order passed by the learned Sessions Judge of discharging
the accused therein of the offence punishable under section 376 of
29.      In the light of the aforesaid position in law, re-adverting to the
facts of the case, prima facie, clause fourthly of section 375 of the
Penal Code seems to be attracted. Firstly, there is material on record
to show that the petitioner and the prosecutrix went through the
ceremony of marriage. Secondly, there is adequate material to
demonstrate that the petitioner and prosecutrix cohabited as
husband and wife. Thirdly, it is not the case of the petitioner that his
spouse was not living on the date when he went through the
marriage ceremony. On the contrary, the petitioner asserts that the
ceremonies were mere props. Fourthly, the assertion of the
prosecutrix that she gave consent for the physical relations as she
was made to believe that she is the wife of the petitioner is also
prima facie borne out by the material on record. Conversely, it is not
the case of the petitioner, that the prosecutrix knew that he was
married and thus such a belief could not have been entertained.
30.         The upshot of the aforesaid consideration is that there are
sufficient grounds to proceed against the petitioner, even for the
offence punishable under section 376 of the Penal Code. The trial
thus must proceed to its logical conclusion. Resultantly, the petition
deserves to be dismissed.
2]       By way of abundant caution, it is clarified that the
observations are confined to the consideration of the prayer for
discharge and the trial Court shall decide the Session Case on its
own merits and in accordance with law without being influenced by
any of the observations made hereinabove.
3]       Rule discharged.
