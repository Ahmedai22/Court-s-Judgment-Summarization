1.    The present PIL is filed with the following reliefs:
“a. This Hon'ble Court may be please to declare that the
conduct of the Respondent No. 1 & 2 have disqualified
themselves for holding any constitutional posts of Vice
President and Minister of the Union Cabinet respectively by
expressing lack of faith in the Constitution of India and the law
established by their behaviour and utterances made in public.
b.      This Hon'ble Court may be please to restrain the
Respondent No.1 from discharging his duty as Vice President
of India.
c.    This Hon'ble Court may be please to restrain the
Respondent No.2 from discharging his duty as cabinet
Minister of Union of India.
2.    The Petitioner claims to be a body registered under the
Societies Registration Act 1860 established by a group of Advocates
practicing at Bombay High Court with the primary purpose to
undertake activities to uphold rule of law, promote high values in
legal profession and to protect independence of judiciary.
3.    Mr. Abdi, the learned Counsel for the Petitioner submits that
Respondent Nos.1 and 2 have disqualified themselves to hold the
constitutional post by showing lack of faith in the Constitution of
India by their conduct and utterances made in public and by
attacking its institutions including Hon’ble Supreme Court of India
and showing scant regard for the law laid down by the Hon’ble
Supreme Court. The conduct of Respondent Nos.1 and 2 appeared
to have shaken public faith in Hon’ble Supreme Court of India and
the Constitution. Respondent Nos.1 and 2 have affirmed oath that
they will bear true faith and allegiance to the Constitution of India.
However, their conduct has shown lack of faith in Constitution of
India. Respondent Nos.1 and 2 have launched frontal attack on the
institution of judiciary, particularly the Hon’ble Surpeme Court of
India in most derogatory language without any recourse which is
available under the constitutional scheme to change the status quo
as per the law laid down by the Hon’ble Supreme Court of India.
Respondent Nos.1 and 2 are attacking the collegium system as well
as basic structure in public platform. This kind of unbecoming
behaviour    by Respondent        Nos.1 and 2 who are           holding
constitutional posts is lowering the majesty of the Hon’ble Supreme
Court of India in the eye of public at large. The learned Counsel
referred to various statements made by Respondent Nos.1 and 2.
4.     The learned Counsel for the Petitioner submits that Article 51-
A of the Constitution of India lays down the fundamental duties. It
directs every citizen to abide by the Constitution and respect its
ideals and institutions, the National Flag and the National Anthem.
Respondent Nos.1 and 2 have failed to abide by their fundamental
duties and have not shown respect to the constitutional institution
i.e. Hon’ble Supreme Court of India. The learned Counsel submits
that Respondent Nos.1 and 2 are also guilty of committing contempt
of Court by lowering the authority of the Hon’ble Supreme Court. The
authorities who are responsible to take action against Respondent
Nos.1 and 2 have failed in their duty, as such, this Court, under
Article 226 of the Constitution of India may exercise its powers. The
learned Counsel relies upon the judgment of the Calcutta High Court
in the case of Babul Supriyo Vs. State of West bengal & Anr. 1 and
submits that it has been held by the Calcutta High Court that it is
expected from a representative of the people that he must be
courteous in his behaviour, dignified in his manners and cautious on
the words spoken by him. The learned Counsel also relies upon the
judgment of the Supreme Court in the case of A.I.I.M.S. Students
Union Vs. A.I.I.M.S. & Ors .2 to submit that the fundamental duties,
though not enforceable by a writ of Court, yet provide valuable guide
1 dated on 14 th October 2020
and aid to interpretation of constitutional and legal issues.
5.    Mr. Anil Singh, the learned Additional Solicitor General
submits that the present PIL is filed for publicity purpose. It is false
and frivolous. Respondent Nos.1 and 2 have complete faith in the
Constitution.      The Petitioner has annexed the statement of
Respondent No.2 wherein it is said that the Central Government,
under the Prime Minister has never undermined the authority of the
judiciary and its independence will always remain untouched and
promoted.     Respondent     No.1 has also said that he has highest
respect for the judiciary and committed to the Constitution.          The
Vice President cannot be removed by orders under Article 226 of the
Constitution. The learned ASG relies upon the judgment of the apex
court in the case of Dattaraj Nathuji Thaware Vs. State of
Maharasthra & Ors. 3 and submits that the PILs are to be admitted
with great care. The PILs cannot be for redressal, publicity oriented
or political disputes.
7.    Juridically, the expression “Public Interest Litigation” means a
legal action initiated in a Court of Law for the enforcement of public
interest.   The PIL is a power given to the public by the Courts
through judicial activism. It is a litigation filed in the Court of law for
protection of public interest. The PIL can be used for redressal of a
genuine public wrong or public injury and it cannot be publicity-
oriented. The parameters of PIL have been indicated by the apex
court in catena of judgments.
8.    In the present matter, the Petitioner claims to be established
by a group of Advocates practicing at Bombay High Court with the
primary object of undertaking activities to uphold rule of law,
promote high values in legal profession and to protect independence
of judiciary.   The Petitioner seeks disqualification of Respondent
Nos.1 and 2 holding constitutional post on the ground that their
utterances have shaken the public faith in the Hon’ble Supreme
Court of India and the Constitution.
9.    The credibility of the Hon’ble Supreme Court of India is sky-
high.    It cannot be eroded or impinged by the statements of
individuals. The Constitution of India is supreme and sacrosanct.
Every citizen of India is bound by the Constitution and is expected to
abide by the constitutional values. The constitutional institutions
are to be respected by all, including constitutional authorities and
persons holding constitutional posts.
10.   The statements made         by Respondent         Nos.1 and 2 are
annexed with the petition. The learned Additional Solicitor General
has referred to some of the statements made by Respondent Nos.1
and 2, wherein it has been said that the Government has never
undermined the authority of the judiciary and its independence will
always remain untouched and promoted and they respect the ideals
of the Constitution. Respondent No.1 has also made a statement that
he has highest respect for the judiciary and is committed to the
Constitution of India.      The constitutional authorities cannot be
removed in the manner as suggested by the Petitioner. Fair criticism
of the judgment is permissible.     It is no doubt, fundamental duty of
every citizen to abide by the Constitution. Majesty of law has to be
11.    Considering the totality of the factual matrix, we do not find it
a fit case to invoke our writ jurisdiction under Article 226 of the
Constitution of India in entertaining the PIL.
12.    The PIL, as such, is dismissed.
