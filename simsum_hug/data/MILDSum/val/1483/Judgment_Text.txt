“What God has joined together, let no one separate” is the sublime ideal read in the Bible
(Matthew 19:6, Mark 10:9). Do spouses in that union have the right to separate their
marriage, mutually, before the aura of the marriage period of one year vanishes, is the
question presented in these matters. Two young Christians are before us. Their marriage
was solemnized on 30.01.2022, in accordance with the Christian rites and ceremonies.
They realised that their marriage was a mistake. The marriage was not consummated.
On 31.5.2022, they moved a joint petition for divorce before the Family Court, Ernakulam,
under Section 10 A of the Divorce Act, 1869 (hereinafter referred to as the “Act”). The
Family Court registry refused to number the same, apparently noting the bar in filing a
joint petition within one year after the marriage, as referrable under Section 10 A of the
Act. The petition was filed under Section 151 of the Code of Civil Procedure. This was
taken up on the judicial side. The Family Court rejected the petition holding that one-year
separation after the marriage is an essential condition to maintain a petition under Section
10A of the Act. Challenging this order, both parties approached this Court in
O.P.No.398/2022. Thereafter, the matter was heard at length. In O.P.No.398/2022, this
Court appointed Advocates Sandhya Raju and Leela R. as amici curiae to assist the
Court. Realising that the bar is created by statute, the couple filed W.P. (
C).No.28317/2022 to declare that the waiting period of one year fixed under Section
10A(1) of the Act is unconstitutional. Both matters were taken up together.
2.      Heard the learned counsel Smt.Sikha G. Nair appearing for the petitioners, Amici
curiae Adv.Sandhya Raju and Adv. R Leela and the learned Central Government
3.      The Indian Divorce Act was enacted during the British period in the year 1869 to
confer on certain Courts the jurisdiction in matrimonial disputes of persons professing
Christianity. By the Amendment Act 51/2001, the word “Indian” appearing in the name of
the Act had been omitted. The 1869 law was based on the British enactment of 1858 .
The British scrapped the above law in 1923. The Law Commission of India in its 164th
report recommended that the Parliament enact a comprehensive law governing marriage
and divorce and other allied aspects of Christians in India. Based on the recommendation,
the Central Government convened a meeting of prominent leaders of the Christian
Communities in India and Members of Parliament belonging to the Christian community
on 28.4.2001. Based on the understanding arrived at in the meeting, the divorce law was
amended by removing the onerous conditions as contained in Section 10 of the Act and
also doing away with the procedures causing delay in obtaining divorce due to the
provisions contained in Sections 17 and 20 of the Act. One of the salient provisions was
brought in by amendment in the year 2001, namely, the dissolution of marriage by mutual
consent. Section 10A of the Act was inserted as a provision for dissolution of marriage by
mutual consent in addition to Section 10 of the Act, the grounds for dissolution of marriage
on fault basis.
10- A. Dissolution of marriage by mutual consent. -(1) Subject to the provisions of this Act
and the rules made thereunder, a petition for dissolution of marriage may be presented
to the District Court by both the parties to a marriage together, whether such marriage
was solemnized before or after the commencement of the Indian Divorce ( Amendment)
Act, 2001, on the ground that they have been living separately for a period of two years
or more, that they have not been able to live together and they have mutually agreed that
the marriage should be dissolved.
(2) On the motion of both the parties made not earlier than six months after the date of
presentation of the petition referred to in sub-section (1) and not later than eighteen
months after the said date, if the petition is not withdrawn by both the parties in the
meantime, the Court shall, on being satisfied, after hearing the parties and making such
inquiry, as it thinks fit, that a marriage has been solemnized and that the averments in the
petition are true, pass a decree declaring the marriage to be dissolved with effect from
the date of decree.
As seen from Section 10A of the Act, a petition for dissolution of marriage can be
presented to the Court under Section 10A only on the ground that the parties to the
marriage have been living separately for a period of two years or more and that they have
not been able to live together.
4.      A Division Bench of this Court in Saumya Ann Thomas v. The Union of India
and others [MANU/KE/0255/2010] held that the stipulation of a period of two years as
the minimum mandatory period under Section 10A is arbitrary and oppressive and the
period of two years has to be read as one year. This was taking note of the oneyear period
stipulated in Section 28(1) of the Special Marriage Act, Section 13B(1) of the Hindu
Marriage Act and Section 32B(1) of the Parsi Marriage and Divorce Act.
5.      There are three types of theories that have been recognised for the separation of
a legal marriage, (i)fault theory, (ii) irretrievable breakdown theory and (iii) no-fault basis
(mutual consent).
6.      Divorce by mutual consent reflects the will of the parties to separate and get rid of
the marriage. The legislature has put safeguards against impulsive decisions that may
permeate such a decision by stipulating a gestation period before presenting a petition
for divorce on mutual consent. This period will insulate possible peril that may ensue for
the parties as a follow-up of the decision for mutual separation. In the Indian social
context, though marriages are solemnized by two individuals, it is seen more as a union
for laying the foundation for a strong family and society. Many laws have been made and
many rights have been created based on familial relationships. The legislature, therefore,
decided that a minimum period of separation must precede before presentation of a
petition for divorce on the ground of mutual consent.
7.      The problem presented in this case is when the waiting period itself would cause
hardship to the parties. Can the law command parties to sit at the fence and suffer the
agony? The legislature in its wisdom contemplated possible repercussions of such
fixation of minimum period that would result in hardships to spouses and accordingly
allowed the Courts to entertain a petition within the minimum period in exceptional cases.
This is how Section 29 of the Special Marriage Act and Section 14 of the Hindu Marriage
Act, enabled the Courts to entertain the petition to be presented before one year had
lapsed from the date of marriage. There is no corresponding provision in the Divorce Act
for the Court to permit the dissolution of marriage by mutual consent until the mandatory
period of one year has lapsed from the date of separation. The constitutional validity of
the mandatory period is, therefore, questioned in the writ petition filed by the parties. This
Court in Saumya's case (supra) had no occasion to advert to the validity of the minimum
mandatory period by which spouses are denied the remedy of approaching the Court
before the lapse of one year from the date of marriage or from the date of separation. The
reasoning of the Court found in paragraph 42 of the above judgment reads thus:
42. Having considered all the relevant circumstances, we are of the opinion that the
stipulation of a higher period of two years of mandatory minimum separate residence for
those to whom the Divorce Act applies, in contradistinction to those similarly placed to
whom Sec.13B of the Hindu Marriage Act, Sec.32B of the Parsi Marriage and Divorce Act
and Sec.28 of the Special Marriage Act would apply, offends the mandate of equality and
right to life under Arts.14 and 21 of the Constitution.
The above reasoning of the Court would clearly show that the decision rendered and the
conclusion arrived at was on a premise that the mandatory minimum residence period of
two years for Christians is discriminatory as there is no such prescription of two years
under the Hindu Marriage Act and the Special Marriage Act etc. This Court, however,
considers the question in these cases on a different ground; whether in the absence of
any provisions allowing the parties to a marriage to move the Court before the lapse of
one year from the date of marriage or the date of separation. Can the provisions stand
the test of constitutional scrutiny? The plea of arbitrariness would arise in this context of
denial of judicial remedy to approach the Court before the lapse of one year from the date
of marriage or separation.
8.      Men have free choice to enter into marriage. However, the same freedom is not
accorded to the men to separate the marriage. The State's interference in marriage
through legislation is on the assumption that men are ill-equipped to take a decision for
themselves and the State is competent to take decisions by taking note of the welfare,
needs, interests etc. of men. Legal paternalism is often justified with beneficial intent
which is sought to be secured through legislation, regulation etc. From a liberal
perspective, any encroachment on an individual's right to take a decision would be viewed
as an encroachment on personal liberty. But in our constitutional scheme, the
competency of a legislature to make laws for the common good, keeping in mind the
social context and the larger community interest cannot be termed as an encroachment
on personal liberty. The ideal of the constitution itself is to create a society of values.
These values represent the ethos of society, invalidation of liberty affecting the lives of
others, to promote the welfare and common good of the persons involved in relationships.
John Stuart Mill in his book 'On Liberty', Chapter IV - 'Of The Limits To The Authority Of
Society Over The Individual' discussed the problem relating to controlling the behaviour
of individuals. The author says, “The distinction here pointed out between the part of a
person’s life which concerns only himself, and that which concerns others, many persons
will refuse to admit. How (it may be asked) can any part of the conduct of a member of
society be a matter of indifference to the other members? No person is an entirely isolated
being; it is impossible for a person to do anything seriously or permanently hurtful to
himself, without mischief reaching at least to his near connections, and often far beyond
them. If he injures his property, he does harm to those who directly or indirectly derived
support from it, and usually diminishes..”
9.       The harm likely to cause others is something that bothered the legislature to fix a
mandatory minimum period to present a petition for mutual divorce. We would not have
thought of interfering with a minimum period as it carries a laudable object behind it. But
we are constrained to note that no remedy is provided by statute in exceptional and
depraved conditions for a spouse to approach the Courts to get rid of the minimum period.
The legislature in their wisdom felt that some provisions are to be made to relax the rigour
of the minimum period to entertain a petition within the waiting period of separation in
other statutes. This essentially ensures that efficacious judicial remedy is provided in
cases of exceptional hardships to the parties. The denial of such a remedy to Christians
bothers us. The Court must circumvent from entering into the domain of legislature by
providing measures of relaxation. Individual liberty when curtailed, the Court has to
examine whether the law was passed to further any common good or to protect the larger
interest of the parties. We have already found that there is a rationale behind fixing the
oneyear waiting period. We also note that the very idea of fixing the waiting period before
the presentation is also intended to be secured after the presentation of such a divorce
petition. The Court after presentation under Section 10A(2) of the Act is bound to allow
the parties to think on their decision of mutual separation. The provision states that the
parties shall be given an opportunity to withdraw the petition not earlier than six months
after the date of presentation of the petition. However, we find that the mandate of Section
10A(1) will become oppressive if the parties are not given the option to highlight hardships
and exceptional hardships they may experience during the waiting period. The right to a
judicial remedy if curtailed by statutory provisions, the Court will have to strike it down as
it is violative of a fundamental right. The right to life encompasses judicial remedy as well.
Article 8 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights declares that everyone has the
right to an effective remedy by the competent national Tribunals for acts violating
fundamental rights granted by the constitution or by law. The legislature in other statutes,
having felt the need for relaxation, to redress exceptional circumstances through judicial
remedy, cannot remain in oblivion when concerning the Christian community. Ronald
Dworkin, in his famous book 'Taking Rights Seriously' argues that, ”Individual rights are
political trumps held by individuals. Individuals have rights when, for some reason, a
collective goal is not a sufficient justification for denying them what they wish, as
individuals, to have or to do, or not a sufficient justification for imposing some loss or injury
upon them.” [Introduction Pg.(xi)]. The collective good we find as rationale cannot trample
on the rights of individuals to depart if his or her need to depart is not relatable to the
collective good. We are not holding that the law is discriminatory because of the reason
that different communities in equal circumstances are given different treatment. Law
intends to apply to a particular class or group and that group is not homogeneous with
certain classes or groups being excluded, compelling the legislature to make different
laws for each group. We are of the firm view that when liberty is taken away to act
according to one's will, without any procedure to safeguard the fallout of such restrictions,
the law will become oppressive. But for the legislation, parties would be able to separate
themselves. The legislature cannot take away liberty without adequately safeguarding the
interest of the individuals whose interests to seek remedy are affected even if such
legislation intends to achieve laudable objects.
10. Section 10 of the Divorce Act permits divorce on fault grounds. It is possible for a
spouse to file a petition for divorce without any waiting period. The Court may be able to
grant a divorce even before the period of one year, on being satisfied with the ground for
divorce. One of the grounds to obtain a divorce is willful non-consummation of marriage.
On recognizing the existence of this ground on the basis of fault, one may be able to
obtain a divorce from the Court by not contesting the same. However, if they have shown
wisdom, to avoid stigma, the Court cannot permit to move the petition without the lapse
of a period of one year after separation. This exactly is the dilemma and hardship for the
parties in these cases.
11. We hold that the fixation of the minimum period of separation of one year as
stipulated under Section 10A is violative of the fundamental right and accordingly, strike
it down.
12. We have interacted with the parties who came online before us on the last hearing
date. They also had appeared before the earlier Bench which heard the matter. On both
occasions, they were firm in their decision to separate. In view of the fact that more than
six months have lapsed since the presentation of the petition for divorce before the Court,
we find no further reason for their appearance before the Family Court again.
13. Before parting with the judgment, we hasten to observe that the Legislature’s
competence to enact laws to regulate divorce cannot be doubted as it has an avowed
intention to uphold the common good and welfare of the people and society. The State
knows what is best for the couple and the community. The grounds of divorce on a fault
basis have regulated divorce but in a practical sense, it has resulted in hardships rather
than in promoting welfare. The impact of welfare objectives must reflect on the parties.
Today, the Family Court has become another battleground, adding to the agonies of
parties seeking a divorce. This is obvious for the reason that the substantial legislation
enacted prior to Family Courts Act was fashioned on a platform to adjudicate upon
adversarial interests rather than to promote the common interest or good. The time has
come for a change in the law applicable to the parties on a common uniform platform.
The law differentiates parties based on religion in regard to welfare qua matrimonial
relationship. In a secular country, the legal paternalistic approach should be on the
common good of the citizens rather than based on religion. The State’s concern must be
to promote the welfare and good of its citizens, and religion has no place in identifying
the common good. The Union Government should seriously consider having a uniform
marriage code in India to promote the common welfare and good of spouses in
matrimonial disputes. The legislation on divorce must focus on the parties rather than the
dispute itself. In matrimonial disputes, the law must aid parties to resolve the differences
with the assistance of the Court. If a solution is not possible, the law must allow the Court
to decide what is best for the parties. The procedure for seeking divorce shall not be to
aggravate the bitterness by asking them to fight on preordained imaginary grounds.
14. In the result, these cases are disposed of with the following:
i. W.P.(C).No.28317/2022 is allowed declaring that the stipulation of the one-year
period or more for the purpose of filing a divorce petition by mutual consent under Section
10A is violative of fundamental right and is declared unconstitutional.
ii. O.P.(FC).No.398/2022 is allowed. The Family Court is directed to number the
petition presented by the petitioners seeking divorce on mutual consent and dispose of
the same within two weeks in the light of interaction we had with the parties before us and
to grant a decree of divorce without insisting further presence of parties.
We record our appreciation to Amici curiae Adv.Sandhya Raju and Adv. R Leela.
