2)               We have heard Mr. K.V. Viswanathan, learned Senior Advocate
appearing for the appellant as well as Mr. Tushar Mehta, learned
Solicitor General appearing for the respondent.
3)               An Arbitral Award dated 16.08.2018 was made in favour of the
appellant allowing 10 out of 16 claims which amounted to Rs. 175.32
Crores.              The Award was made of a sum of Rs. 122.76 Crores amounting
to Rs. 56.23 Crores principal and Rs. 66.53 Crores on various
heads.              A Section 34 petition that has been filed by the respondent
is pending before the learned Additional City Civil and Sessions
Judge at Bengaluru.               On 21.12.2019, execution of the said Award was
stayed on deposit of 60% of the figure of Rs. 122.76 Crores and
security being given for the balance.                    Both parties filed writ
petitions against the aforesaid order.                The writ petition filed by
the              appellant  was  dismissed.    The  writ  petition  filed by   the
respondent was allowed in which a deposit of 50% of the principal
amount of Rs. 56.23 Crores was ordered.
4)               Despite this Court repeatedly referring to Section 5 of the
Arbitration Act in particular and the Arbitration Act in general
and despite this Court having laid down in Deep Industries Ltd. Vs.
ONGC & Anr. (2020) 15 SCC 706 that the High Court under Article 226
and 227 should be extremely circumspect in interfering with orders
passed under the Arbitration Act, such interference being only in
cases  of  exceptional  rarity or   cases  which are  stated  to  be
patently lacking in inherent jurisdiction, we find that High Courts
are interfering with deposit orders that have been made.     This is
not a case of exceptional rarity or of any patent lack of inherent
jurisdiction.
5)   This being the case, the impugned order of the High Court of
Karnataka is set aside and that of the learned Additional City
Civil and Sessions Judge is restored.       The deposit of 60% and
security for the remainder is to be made within four weeks from the
date of our order.
6)   The request of the learned Solicitor General that the Section
34 application be disposed of early is acceded to.    The Additional
City Civil and Sessions Judge is therefore directed to dispose of
the Section 34 petition within a period of four months from today.
7)   The appeals are disposed of.
