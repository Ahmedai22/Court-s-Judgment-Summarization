The order of dismissal from service which was confirmed by the
Appellate Authority is under challenge in the present writ petition.
2. The writ petitioner joined as Grade II Police Constable on
12.09.1986 and was promoted to the post of Grade I Police Constable
on 22.07.1997. He was further promoted to the post of Head
Constable on 22.07.2002. The petitioner has served about 25 years in
the Department. On 22.05.2009 while the petitioner was on duty he
fell ill due to severe chest pain and entered on medical leave. The
petitioner was taken to a nearby private hospital for immediate
treatment. The petitioner was unconscious and the Doctors diagnosed
as Chronic Peptic ulcer. Thereafter, the petitioner took Ayurvedic
treatment in his native place. The petitioner submitted medical report
for the purpose of extension of medical leave. The leave applications
were received by the competent authorities. The said leave period
was regularized by the Superintendent of Police in proceeding dated
3. Thereafter, the Department directed the petitioner before the
Medical Board and on obtaining the fitness certificate, the petitioner
joined duty. Thereafter, the charge memo was issued under Rule 3(b)
W.P.No.31934 of 2014
of Tamil Nadu Police Subordinate Service (Discipline & Appeal) Rules
on 12.04.2012. The petitioner denied the charges by stating that he
submitted leave applications properly and his leave period was also
regularized. Without considering the said facts, an enquiry was
ordered and the Enquiry Officer also failed to consider these
documents and submitted his report on 18.07.2012 and thereafter a
second show cause notice was issued. The petitioner submitted his
further objections on 11.10.2012 and thereafter, disciplinary authority
issued the impugned order of dismissal from service in proceedings
dated 07.11.2012. The petitioner preferred an appeal on 13.12.2012
and the said appeal was rejected by the Appellate Authority on
23.01.2013. Thus, petitioner is constrained to move the present writ
petition.
4. The learned counsel for the petitioner mainly contended that
the mis-conduct, if at all alleged by the respondent, the same did not
exist as on the date of issuance of charge memorandum, as entire
leave period was regularized by the competent authority namely
Superintendent of Police in proceedings dated 03.04.2012. Once the
period of medical leave was regularized in accordance with leave
Rules in force and the petitioner joined Government service on
obtaining fitness certificate from the competent Medical Board,
W.P.No.31934 of 2014
initiation of further disciplinary proceedings is unsustainable and
therefore consequently the punishment is liable to be set aside.
5. In respect of the said contention, the learned counsel for the
petitioner relied on the judgment in the case of Dr.G.Rajendran Vs.
The Secretary to Government, Health and Family Welfare
Department reported in (2006) 2 M.L.J 686, wherein the following
observations are made in paragraphs 6 & 7 which are extracted
"6. The point in issue is, whether the respondents
are entitled to take disciplinary action after sanction of
leave for which the petitioner applied.
7. Admittedly, the petitioner had applied for leave
and the same was also sanctioned and salary for the said
date was also paid. A similar issue arose before this Court
in the decision reported in 2000 WLR 848 (K.Orlanto v.
The Managing Direct Tamil Nadu Rubber Corporation ltd.,
& another) wherein this Court set aside the order of
dismissal from service imposed against a Teacher on the
ground that after sanctioning of medical leave, it is not
open to the department to issue charge memo, continue
the disciplinary proceedings and punish the Teacher. The
learned single Judge in para 15 of the judgment held as
"15. It is unfortunate that having passed an
order on 13.3.1995 accepting her case and
W.P.No.31934 of 2014
regularising those periods, in the counter
affidavit, the very same officer has stated that
either "there is no question of petitioner's
absence being regulari sanctioning of leave on
loss of pay, and in fact the entire period of
absence was unauthorised absence". The said
statement is directly contrary to the conclusion
arrived   at    by  the   very same   officer  in
Na.Ka.No.4911/89 Ka, dated 13.3.1995."
The said Judgment was rendered following the Judgment
of the Andhra Pradesh High Court reported in AIR 1996 AP
75(G.Papaiah v. Asst.Director, Medical Services). Further
in para 16 the learned Judge held as under,
"16. ......... In that case, charge No.2 relates
to absence of the petitioner therein from duty
for the period commencing from 16.5.1973
and ending with 25.5.1973. the Major, Officer
Commanding in his order dated 18.6.1973,
granted ten days EOL 16.5.1973 to 25.5.1973
(both days inclusive) to the petitioner to
regularise    his  intentional absence   for  the
period. An argument was made on behalf of
the employer that notwithstanding the grant of
extraordinary leave to the petitioner therein,
he can be proceeded against for his absence
from duty for that period. Rejecting the said
contention learned single Judge has concluded
W.P.No.31934 of 2014
I am unable to agree with the learned counsel
for the respondent that notwithstanding the
grant   of   the    extraordinary    leave    to   the
petitioner, he can be proceeded against for his
absence from duty for that period. Whether it
is an extraordinary leav rdinary leave, leave on
pay, leave on half pay, medical leave, or
casual leave, nonetheless it is a leave. The
kind of nature of leave is not material but the
substance of the matter is that the petitioner
was    granted    leave.    When    once    leave    is
granted to a public servant, in respect of a
particular period, it must be considered that he
is permitted to absent himself from duty for
that   period.   In    such   a   case,  it    is  not
permissible or open to the employer or any
other authority to proceed against the p ublic
servant for absenting from duty for the same
period and punish him. The employer, either
private or public cannot blow hot and cold. The
authorities should have refused to grant leave
of  any    kind    to   the  petitioner   and     then
proceeded to punish him after due and proper
enquiry     and     after   affording    reasonable
opportunity to him. When once leave has been
granted, it cannot be said that the petitioner
had absented himself from duty and thereby
made himself liable to be punished. Hence, the
second cha rge relating to the absense of the
W.P.No.31934 of 2014
petitioner from duty from 16th May, 1973 to
25th May, 1973, both days inclusive, is not
sustainable. I may add that the very order
granting extraordinary leaves states that such
leave has been granted to regularise the
petitioner's intentional absence for the period.
the very purpose of granting the leave being
to    regularise  the   petitioner's  intentional
absence, it is not open to the respondent to
initiate any proceedings against the petitioner
for his absence from d uty for that period.
Judged from any angle, the second charge
must be quashed and it is not sustainable."
6. The said judgment was reflected in the orders of the Hon'ble
Supreme Court of India in the case of Union of India and another
Vs. R.K.Sharma in C.A.No.4059 of 2015, wherein the Apex Court
held that 'we are of the considered opinion that no misconduct can be
attributed for the respondent for the periods he availed one or the
other sanctioned leave.'
7. The learned Special      Government Pleader opposed the
contention by stating that the petitioner remained unauthorizedly
absent for 976 days and therefore the departmental disciplinary
proceedings were initiated. The procedures as contemplated were
W.P.No.31934 of 2014
followed and the petitioner participated in the process of inquiry and
thus, there is no infirmity in conducting the disciplinary proceedings
and in view of the fact that the allegation of unauthorized absence is
for about 3 years and the punishment of dismissal from service was
imposed. Thus, the writ petition is to be rejected.
8. This Court is of the considered opinion that no doubt the
period of absence was lengthy. In normal circumstances, such long
absence will not be condoned by the competent authorities. When the
Police Personnel is a chronic absentee or habitual absentee, then
serious actions are to be initiated. However, once the authority
competent, accepted the reasons for absence, considered the same
and regularized the period of medical leave, thereafter the mis-
conduct if at all committed become condoned and therefore the action
cannot be sustained. In other words, the disciplinary action is
permissible only if the misconduct exist and once the alleged
misconduct was considered based on the explanations or otherwise
and the period of leave has already been regularized then initiation of
disciplinary proceedings cannot be held valid.
9. In the present case, even before issuing the charge
memorandum under Rule 3(b), the period of absence was regularized
W.P.No.31934 of 2014
by the competent authority namely District Superintendent of Police
in proceedings dated 03.04.2012 and by that time, the petitioner
rejoined for duty based on the medical fitness certificate issued by the
10. In view of the facts and circumstances, the period of
absence was regularized by the competent authority, the punishment
of dismissal from service is untenable and consequently the order
impugned         passed   by   the   second   respondent    in   proceedings
No.Tha.Pa.3/2012 dated 07.11.2012 and the appellate order passed
by the first respondent in proceedings C.No.A2/PR No.3/Appeal/2012
dated 23.01.2013 are hereby quashed. The respondents are directed
to reinstate the writ petitioner in service without backwages but with
continuity of service.
11. With the above directions, the writ petition stands allowed.
No costs.
