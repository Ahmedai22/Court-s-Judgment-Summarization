1.     The instant petition under Section 34 of the Arbitration &
Conciliation Act, 1996 (hereinafter referred to as the „Arbitration Act‟)
raises some important questions of law inter alia pertaining to the
interpretation of Section 21 of the Arbitration Act. By way of the instant
petition, the Petitioner seeks indulgence of this Court to set aside the
impugned arbitral award dated 16th March 2015 passed by the learned
sole arbitrator, Mr. Divya Darshan Sharma in the case titled as „CL
Educate Ltd. vs. Monika Oli‘.
2.     The facts necessary for the disposal of the present petition are that
an Employment Agreement was entered into between the Petitioner and
M/s Comprehensive Education and IT Training Institute (hereinafter
referred to as „CEITI‟), a Dubai based entity which was authorized to run
Career Launcher test-prep courses in the United Arab Emirates
(hereinafter referred to as „UAE’). M/s CL Educate Ltd. (hereinafter
referred to as the „Respondent’), is a company registered under the
Companies Act, 1956. By way of the Employment Agreement, the
Petitioner was appointed as the Principal Consultant for its Dubai office
and she was entrusted with the responsibility for enrollment and
collection of fees from students for the test-prep courses in Dubai. She
was also required to bear the costs in relation to rent, marketing and sales,
course material, salary for faculty, among other things.
3.     For the 1st year, as per Clause 2 of the Employment Agreement,
the Petitioner was entitled to 75% of the net collections arising out of
IITJEE, AIEEE, CBSE XII Program, IIT Foundation IX and X, and 85%
of the net collections for all other programs. It was also agreed by the
parties that the collections made by the Petitioner would be deposited in
Career Launcher‟s account and on a monthly basis, the Petitioner‟s share
would be transferred to her account. From the next year onwards, it was
agreed between the parties that the percentage of net collections falling to
the share of the Petitioner would be mutually discussed. It was further
stipulated that from the 2nd year, all collections would accrue to the
Petitioner as her top-line and only remit either 25%/15% (depending on
the product) to Career Launcher.
4.     On 6th November 2013, the Petitioner received a legal notice on
behalf of the Respondent seeking payment of various amounts, including
AED 6,25,775/- on account of alleged short deposit of fee collected by
the Petitioner and AED 13,92,000/- on account of fee allegedly collected
by the Petitioner against the installment due on 31st January 2013 which
was not deposited in the account of the Respondent. On 16th November
2013, the Petitioner responded to the above legal notice dated 6th
November 2013, denying the claims of the Respondent and alleging that
the Respondent has issued the legal notice in order to set up a false case
against the Petitioner as she had on previous occasion raised requests
with the Respondent to settle the accounts between the parties.
5.     The Respondent invoked Clause 10 which contained the
arbitration clause and provided that any dispute arising between the
parties would be referred to a sole arbitrator appointed by the Managing
Director of Career Launcher India Ltd., having its jurisdiction/place at
New Delhi. A sole arbitrator was appointed and the Petitioner was
proceeded ex parte. The arbitral tribunal passed the impugned arbitral
award by which the claims raised by the Respondent were allowed
against the Petitioner.
6.     Aggrieved with the passing of the impugned arbitral award, the
Petitioner has approached this Court under Section 34 of the Arbitration
(on behalf of the petitioner)
7.     Mr. Jayant Mehta, learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of
petitioner, in support of the instant petition has strenuously argued that
the impugned arbitral award is wholly illegal as the Petitioner has never
received the mandatory notice under Section 21 of the Arbitration Act by
which the arbitration proceedings are to be commenced. It is further
submitted that the Petitioner has never received any communication
whatsoever inter alia stating the name or the information qua the
appointment of the Arbitrator, to adjudicate the dispute which has arisen
between the parties.
8.     Mr. Mehta, learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of petitioner
submitted that though the Arbitrator has given his consent vide notice
dated 10th March 2014 and directed the parties to appear before him on
2nd May 2014, but the Petitioner has never received any communication
indicating the consent from the Arbitrator. It is further submitted that the
Petitioner also never received any communication directing her to appear
on 2nd May 2014. It is also argued that the Petitioner did not receive any
communication whatsoever from the arbitrator notifying the first hearing
of the arbitration. It is vehemently submitted that the Petitioner has for
the very first time received an email on 5th June 2014 from the arbitrator
stating that the proceeding could not take place on 2nd May 2014, and the
next date of hearing was shifted to 9th July 2014.
9.     Learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of petitioner submitted
that the claim petition filed by the Respondent before the Arbitrator on 9 th
July 2014 was also never served upon the Petitioner which is a serious
error that goes to the root of the matter. It is also submitted that though
the Respondent was directed by the Arbitrator on 23rd September 2014 to
re-send a copy of the notice dated 10th March 2014 to the Petitioner and
to place on record a copy of the dispatch proof as well as the delivery
report, but no such courier was ever received by the Petitioner to this
effect. It is further submitted that the Petitioner gained knowledge of the
impugned Award on 23rd May 2022 when the Petitioner received a notice
dated 19th May 2022 from a Dubai Court.
10.    Learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of petitioner further
submitted that in the execution proceedings in UAE, the Respondent
herein has taken a stand that the impugned arbitral award was sent by the
learned Arbitrator to the Petitioner through courier on 18th March 2015
and a courier receipt has also been provided as a proof of delivery.
However, it is submitted by the learned senior counsel that this does not
evidence receipt by the Petitioner of the impugned arbitral award. It is
further submitted that the Petitioner has filed an appeal against the notice
dated 19th May 2022 issued by a Dubai Court which is pending before the
Appellate Court in Dubai. It is further submitted that in the reply filed by
the Respondent herein to that appeal, the Respondent has miserably failed
to place on record any evidence to establish that the notice dated 10th
March 2014 issued by the Arbitrator giving his consent to act as the
Arbitrator was ever dispatched or delivered to the Petitioner by any mode.
11.    Learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of petitioner further
vehemently argued that the Arbitrator ought to have addressed a
communication subsequent to his appointment, notifying the first date of
hearing, and thereafter communicating every order passed. It is submitted
that vague and isolated emails sent to the Petitioner by the Arbitrator
cannot constitute proper notice. It is accordingly, submitted that grave
prejudice has been caused to the Petitioner in being impeded to meet her
defence before the Arbitral Tribunal. It is also argued that the Petitioner
has received only two correspondences, first, legal notice dated 6th
November 2013 issued by the Respondent to the Petitioner and second,
email dated 5th June 2014 sent by the Arbitrator to the Petitioner. Learned
senior counsel has categorically denied the receipt of the following
correspondences which has been mentioned in the impugned arbitral
1. Letter dated January 2014 pertaining to appointment of the
2. Arbitration commencement Notice dated 10th March 2014 issued
by the Arbitrator to the Petitioner and the Respondent.
3. Pleadings or Statement of Claim filed by the Respondent herein.
4. Order dated 1st November 2014 passed by the Arbitrator vide
which the Petitioner herein was proceeded ex parte.
12.    Another main ground taken by Mr. Mehta, learned senior counsel
appearing on behalf of petitioner, is that the Employment Agreement was
executed between the Petitioner and CEITI, which is a separate and
distinct legal entity, based in Dubai; and not between the Petitioner and
the Respondent herein. It is submitted that as the arbitration proceedings
were alleged to have been initiated by the Respondent relying on the said
Employment Agreement and accordingly, the invocation of the
arbitration proceedings is bad in law as there is no privity of contract
between the Petitioner and the Respondent. It is also submitted that such
an infirmity goes to the root of the matter rendering the impugned arbitral
award as null and void.
13.     Learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of petitioner has also
pleaded that a bare perusal of the impugned arbitral award would show
that it has been passed by treating the Indian Law as the substantive law
of the contract whereas, the substantive law of the contract was the UAE
Federal Labour Law. It is further submitted that the parties had agreed for
the substantive law of the contract to be the UAE Federal Labour Law
and according to which, employment and labour disputes are not capable
of resolution by arbitration, i.e., they are non-arbitrable disputes. It is
accordingly submitted that the impugned arbitral award is completely
perverse and in conflict with the public policy of India and hence, is
liable to be set aside under Section 34(2)(b)(ii) of the Arbitration Act.
14.     Learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of petitioner submitted
that the Arbitrator has erred in interpreting the provisions of the
Employment Agreement as he has awarded the entire claim amount
demanded by the Respondent herein. It is submitted that as per the
provisions of the Employment Agreement, from the 2nd year onwards, all
collections would have accrued to the Petitioner as her top-line which
means that the Petitioner would retain the collections and would only
remit either 25%/15% (depending on the product) to Career Launcher and
hence, the approach taken by the Arbitrator does not stand to reason in
view of the specific provisions of the Employment Agreement. It is
further submitted that the Arbitrator has returned an erroneous finding
that the Employment Agreement stood automatically renewed in view of
the specific conditions in the Employment Agreement inasmuch as the
conditions requisite for the automatic renewal were never satisfied. It is
submitted that for automatic renewal, two conditions should have been
satisfied, which in the present facts and circumstances have not been
satisfied, first, the Petitioner should continue the employment after expiry
of the Employment Agreement and second, neither party has given a
notice declining renewal at least 30 days prior to the expiry date. It is also
argued that the Arbitrator has awarded an exorbitant interest of 18% per
annum, without there being any provision in the contract for award of
interest, let alone such a high quantum of interest. This is contrary to the
basic notions of justice and thus, the Arbitral Award is liable to be set
aside under Section 34(2)(b)(ii) of the Arbitration Act.
15.    He has relied upon the following judicial pronouncements to
substantiate the submissions made in support of the instant petition:
a) Alupro Building Systems Pvt. Ltd. vs. Ozone Overseas Pvt. Ltd.,
b) Sachin Gupta vs. K.S. Metal Forge Pvt. Ltd., (2013) 10 SCC 540.
c) Suvidha Infracon Pvt. Ltd vs. Intec Capital Ltd., (2018) SCC
d) Union of India vs. Tecco Trichy Engineers & Contractors, (2005)
e) Benarsi Krishna Committee vs. Karmyogi Shelters Pvt. Ltd.,
f) State of Maharashtra vs. Ark Builders, (2011) 4 SCC 616.
(on behalf of the respondent)
16.    Per Contra, Mr. Dhruv Mehta, learned senior counsel appearing on
behalf of respondent has taken a preliminary objection to the
maintainability of the present petition and has submitted that the instant
petition is clearly barred by limitation, as it has been filed after the expiry
of eight years from the date of receipt of the award by the Petitioner. It is
further submitted that the Petitioner has taken a frivolous plea that the
impugned award dated 16th March 2015 came to the knowledge of the
Petitioner only on 23rd May 2022 inasmuch as the impugned award was
delivered to the Petitioner on 23rd March 2015 by the Arbitrator which is
also evident from the additional documents filed by the Petitioner itself.
17.    Learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of respondent
submitted that provisions of the Limitation Act, 1963 are not applicable
for the purpose of Section 34 of the Arbitration Act as the Arbitration Act
is a complete code in itself. Learned senior counsel has further relied on
Section 34(3) of the Arbitration Act to contend that the arbitral award can
be challenged within a period of three months of the receipt of the Award,
which can be extended only for a further period of 30 days on showing
sufficient cause. It is also submitted that as per various authoritative
judicial pronouncements by the Hon‟ble Supreme Court, the time-line
provided under Section 34(3) of the Arbitration Act is mandatory and
inflexible and hence, this Court does not have any power to condone any
delay exceeding 30 days.
18.    Learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of respondent has
relied on para 8.16 of the Petition as well as page nos. 136 and 137 of the
additional documents filed by the Petitioner to contend that the Petitioner
had full knowledge of the arbitral award and had also received a copy of
the impugned arbitral award on 23rd March 2015 as the tracking report of
the parcel No. DHL-1491930425 (a parcel containing arbitral award sent
by the Arbitrator to the Petitioner by Express India) clearly shows that the
impugned arbitral award was delivered to Mr. Shrey Baxi, who is a
partner/employee of the Petitioner herein. It is submitted that the parcel
was accepted by Mr. Shrey Baxi on behalf of the Petitioner as he has a
full-time association with the entity namely the Knowledge Planet UAE
(an entity run by the Petitioner). Learned senior counsel has placed
reliance on Section 3 of the Arbitration Act to contend that any written
communication if delivered at the place of business is deemed to have
been received on the day it is so delivered. It is accordingly, submitted
that the contention of the Petitioner that the knowledge of the impugned
arbitral award came to the notice of the Petitioner on 23rd May 2022 is
totally false and contrary to the record as Section 34(3) of the Act is not
dependent on the knowledge but on the receipt of the award sent by the
19.    It is further submitted that the Petitioner in her reply to the legal
notice issued by the Respondent‟s Advocate has signed as Chief Mentor
of the Knowledge Planet and the address of the Petitioner is undisputed
and has not been denied in any of the pleadings or otherwise. It is
accordingly submitted that the award has been delivered at the undisputed
address of the Petitioner in Dubai and hence, the requirements of Section
31(5) of the Arbitration Act has been complied with. Learned senior
counsel has submitted that the impugned arbitral award is not a result of
some overnight proceeding but has been passed after giving several
opportunities to the Petitioner to appear and answer the claims of the
Respondent      which    is   evident   inter  alia  from   the   following
correspondences:
a) Issuance of legal notice dated 6th November 2013 by the
Respondent to the Petitioner to initiate legal proceeding by stating
to refer the dispute for Arbitration.
b) Reply to the above legal notice by the petitioner on 16 th November
c) Email dated 5th June 2014 from the Arbitrator to both the parties
clearly mentioned the pendency of Arbitral proceeding.
d) Arbitrator in para 2,3, and 4 of the Award stated that he gave
consent vide notice dated 10th March 2014 and accordingly, parties
were directed to appear before the Tribunal on 2nd May 2014.
e) Arbitrator in para 5, 6, and 7 of the Award mentioned that on 23rd
September 2014 Respondent herein was directed to re-send the
copy of the notice dated 10th March 2014 along with the order
dated 23rd September 2014 to the Petitioner and the courier receipt
of same was filed on 1st November 2014.
20.    Learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of respondent has
further submitted that the notice under Section 21 of the Arbitration Act
was duly issued by the Respondent to the Petitioner by way of a legal
notice dated 6th November 2013, which clearly indicated the intention of
the Respondent to initiate the arbitral proceedings in case of continuous
breach of the Employment Agreement . It is submitted that the Petitioner
has even replied to this legal notice. It is further submitted that the notice
appointing the Arbitrator was also sent to the Petitioner in January 2014,
stating that as disputes have arisen between the parties on account of
alleged violation of the terms and conditions of the Employment
Agreement by the Petitioner, the Respondent was appointing a sole
Arbitrator to adjudicate the disputes. It is also submitted that the
statement of claim filed by the Respondent herein was also sent to the
Petitioner and the receipt of the same is also filed in the additional
documents filed by the Petitioner.
21.    Learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of respondent also
submitted that the curial law applicable to the Employment Agreement
was Indian law and thus all the requirements of the delivery of service as
required under the Indian laws stands satisfied as the communications
made to the Petitioner were duly received by the Petitioner. It is further
submitted that the ground taken by the Petitioner that there existed no
arbitration agreement between the Petitioner and the Respondent is
misconceived and in the nature of an argument of last resort. It is
submitted that at no point of time, either at the time of exchange of emails
or otherwise, the Petitioner has denied the existence of the arbitration
agreement or even otherwise, a simple perusal of the Employment
Agreement clearly shows that there exists a valid arbitration agreement
between the Petitioner and the Respondent.
22.     Learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of respondent has
taken a vehement plea that the right of the Petitioner to raise the issue of
non-compliance of Section 21 stands waived in accordance with Section
4 of the Arbitration Act as she has failed to participate in the arbitral
proceedings despite being aware of the continuation of the arbitral
proceedings. Even otherwise, it is submitted that the Section 21 of the
Arbitration Act is a derogable provision which is apparent from the fact
that it starts with the words “Unless otherwise agreed by the parties…‖
23.     It is further argued that the Employment Agreement clearly
provided for the resolution of the disputes arising between the parties as
per Indian law, as the seat of the arbitration proceedings was envisaged to
be at New Delhi. It is accordingly, submitted that the disputed
adjudicated between the parties were clearly arbitrable. It is also
submitted that it is no longer res integra that the Courts under Section 34
of the Arbitration Act would not sit in Appeal over the findings recorded
by the Arbitrator thereby, reviewing the interpretation of the contract as
well as the factual findings arrived by the Arbitrator. It is submitted that
the Writ of execution has already been granted by the First Court of
Dubai and the petitioner has filed an Appeal in the Court of Appeal in
Dubai challenging the execution proceedings and hence, the sole purpose
of filing the present petition is to halt and create obstructions in the
execution proceedings presently going on in Dubai Courts, for the
execution of the impugned arbitral award.
24.    He has relied on the following judicial pronouncements to
substantiate his argument that the present petition is liable to be
a) Mahindra    and    Mahindra      Financial   Service    Limited     v.
Maheshbhai Tinabhai Rathod and Others, (2022) 4 SCC 162.
b) P. Radha Bai v. P. Ashok Kumar, (2019) 13 SCC 445.
c) Manohar Lal & Co. v. Axis Bank Ltd. 2018 SCC Online Cal
d) Rlj Ferro Alloys Pvt. Ltd. & Ors v. M/s. Reliance Capital Limited,
e) Shri Lachoo Mal vs Shri Radhey Shyam (1971) 1 SCC 619.
f) Prasun Roy vs Calcutta MDA (1987) 4 SCC 217.
(Rebuttal on behalf of petitioner)
25.    In the rejoinder, the learned senior counsel for the petitioner
submitted that the legal notice dated 6th November 2013 can in no case
amount to a notice under Section 21 of the Arbitration Act. It is submitted
that under Section 21, an arbitration proceeding commences ―on the date
on which a request for that dispute to be referred to arbitration is
received by the Respondent" but the notice dated 6th November 2013
neither contains any request to refer disputes to arbitration nor proposes
any Arbitrator to be appointed, and merely mentions that such reference
would occur in the future if the Respondent‟s demands are not met. It is
further submitted that this notice itself has been described by the
Respondent as a „legal demand notice‟ which cannot satisfy the essentials
of Section 21 of the Arbitration Act.
26.    Learned senior counsel also submitted that the tracking report
clearly shows that the impugned arbitral award was not delivered to
Monika Oli but to one Mr. Shrey Baxi. It is categorically denied by the
learned senior counsel that Mr. Baxi is a partner/employee of Monika Oli
and that he accepted the impugned award on behalf of the Petitioner. It is
further submitted that Knowledge Planet LLC is a company registered in
Dubai in which the Petitioner is a minority shareholder and Mr. Baxi is an
employee and hence, he could not have accepted any service on behalf of
the Petitioner.
27.    Learned senior counsel has also taken a vehement plea that
issuance of notice under Section 21 of the Arbitration Act is mandatory
and its non-issuance renders the entire arbitral proceedings as non-est and
void ab initio. It is further submitted that Section 4 of the Arbitration Act
cannot be invoked to waive the requirement of Section 21 of the
Arbitration Act as the compliance with the latter is a matter of mandatory
statutory requirement. Even otherwise, it is submitted that Section 4 of
the Act applies only in those cases where the party „proceeds with
arbitration without stating his objection‟. In the instant case, it is
submitted that the Petitioner was proceeded ex-parte and as such, there
arises no question of the Petitioner having proceeded with the arbitration.
In other words, a party cannot be said to be one who “proceeds with” an
arbitration if, as in the present case, the party has not participated inter
alia due to lack of proper notice of the proceedings.
28.    It is further argued that delivery of signed arbitral award is not
governed by Section 3 of the Arbitration Act but is governed by Section
31(5) of the Arbitration Act and hence, the arbitral award must have been
delivered to the individual who was a party to the arbitration proceedings
or the responsible officer of an entity which is a party handling the
arbitral dispute. It is accordingly, submitted that delivery of arbitral award
being not a mere formality, was not satisfied in the present facts and
circumstances of the case.
29.    Heard learned senior counsel appearing for the parties at length and
also perused the record of the instant petition. This Court has carefully
perused the impugned arbitral award, and has given thoughtful
consideration to the submissions advanced on behalf of the parties.
30.    The primary question which requires consideration is:
I. Whether the present petition under Section 34 of the
Arbitration Act is barred by limitation?
(i) Whether the delivery of the impugned arbitral award
to one Mr. Shrey Baxi can be taken as receipt of the
award to the Petitioner in view of the provisions of the
(ii) Whether the various correspondences between the
Petitioner, Respondent and the Arbitrator constitute as a
valid notice under Section 21 of the Arbitration Act?
31.    It is necessary to reproduce Section 34(3) of the Arbitration Act,
which reads as under:-
“34. Application for setting aside arbitral award.—(1)
Recourse to a Court against an arbitral award may be made
only by an application for setting aside such award in
accordance with sub-section (2) and subsection (3).
(3) An application for setting aside may not be made after
three months have elapsed from the date on which the party
making that application had received the arbitral award or,
if a request had been made under Section 33, from the date
on which that request had been disposed of by the arbitral
Provided that if the Court is satisfied that the applicant was
prevented by sufficient cause from making the application
within the said period of three months it may entertain the
application within a further period of thirty days, but not
thereafter.‖
32.    In the present case, it is not disputed that the impugned arbitral
award was passed on 16th March 2015. But the Petitioner has vehemently
disputed the receipt of the arbitral award on 23rd March 2015 which is
alleged to have been sent by the learned Arbitrator. The Arbitration Act
in Para 4(v) of the Statement of Objects and Reasons states one of the
most important objectives which is the need “to minimize the supervisory
role of courts in the arbitral process”. Section 5 of the Arbitration Act is
in the nature of injunction to the Courts and clearly defines the scope of
judicial intervention in an Arbitration proceeding. Section 5 of the
Arbitration Act is reproduced below:
―5. Extent of judicial intervention.—Notwithstanding
anything contained in any other law for the time being in
force, in matters governed by this Part, no judicial authority
shall intervene except where so provided in this Part.‖
33.    The Hon‟ble Supreme Court in Mahindra & Mahindra Financial
Services Ltd. vs. Maheshbhai Tinabhai Rathod & Ors., (2022) 4 SCC
162, has given the following interpretation to Section 34(3) of the
―9. The scope available for condonation of delay being
self-contained in the proviso to Section 34(3) and Section 5
of the Limitation Act not being applicable has been taken
note by this Court in its earlier decisions, which we may
note. In Union of India v. Popular Construction Co. [Union
of India v. Popular Construction Co., (2001) 8 SCC 470] it
has been held as hereunder : (SCC pp. 474-76, paras 12, 14
―12. As far as the language of Section 34 of the 1996
Act is concerned, the crucial words are ―but not
thereafter‖ used in the proviso to sub-section (3). In our
opinion, this phrase would amount to an express
exclusion within the meaning of Section 29(2) of the
Limitation Act, and would therefore bar the application
of Section 5 of that Act. Parliament did not need to go
further. To hold that the court could entertain an
application to set aside the award beyond the extended
period under the proviso, would render the phrase ―but
not thereafter‖ wholly otiose. No principle of
interpretation would justify such a result.
14. Here the history and scheme of the 1996 Act
support the conclusion that the time-limit prescribed
under Section 34 to challenge an award is absolute and
unextendible by court under Section 5 of the Limitation
Act. The Arbitration and Conciliation Bill, 1995 which
preceded the 1996 Act stated as one of its main objectives
the need ―to minimise the supervisory role of courts in
the arbitral process‖ [ Para 4(v) of the Statement of
Objects and Reasons of the Arbitration and Conciliation
Act, 1996.] . This objective has found expression in
Section 5 of the Act which prescribes the extent of
judicial intervention in no uncertain terms:
‗5. Extent      of      judicial      intervention.—
Notwithstanding anything contained in any other law
for the time being in force, in matters governed by this
Part, no judicial authority shall intervene except
where so provided in this Part.‘
16. Furthermore, Section 34(1) itself provides that
recourse to a court against an arbitral award may be
made only by an application for setting aside such award
―in accordance with‖ sub-section (2) and sub-section (3).
Sub-section (2) relates to grounds for setting aside an
award and is not relevant for our purposes. But an
application filed beyond the period mentioned in Section
34, sub-section (3) would not be an application ―in
accordance with‖ that sub-section. Consequently by
virtue of Section 34(1), recourse to the court against an
arbitral award cannot be made beyond the period
prescribed. The importance of the period fixed under
Section 34 is emphasised by the provisions of Section 36
which provide that
‗36. Enforcement.—Where the time for making an
application to set aside the arbitral award under
Section 34 has expired … the award shall be enforced
under the Civil Procedure Code, 1908 (5 of 1908) in
the same manner as if it were a decree of the Court.‘
This is a significant departure from the provisions of the
Arbitration Act, 1940. Under the 1940 Act, after the time
to set aside the award expired, the court was required to
―proceed to pronounce judgment according to the award,
and upon the judgment so pronounced a decree shall
follow‖ (Section 17). Now the consequence of the time
expiring under Section 34 of the 1996 Act is that the
award becomes immediately enforceable without any
further act of the court. If there were any residual doubt
on the interpretation of the language used in Section 34,
the scheme of the 1996 Act would resolve the issue in
favour of curtailment of the court's powers by the
exclusion of the operation of Section 5 of the Limitation
9.1. Further, in State of H.P. v. Himachal Techno
Engineers [State of H.P. v. Himachal Techno Engineers,
(2010) 12 SCC 210 : (2010) 4 SCC (Civ) 605] it was noted
and held as hereunder : (SCC pp. 211-12, paras 2 & 5)
―2. A petition under Section 34 of the Arbitration and
Conciliation Act, 1996 (―the Act‖ for short) was filed by
the appellant on 11-3-2008, challenging the arbitral
award. The petition was accompanied by an application
under sub-section (3) of Section 34 of the Act, for
condonation of delay of 28 days in filing the petition. The
respondent resisted the application contending that the
petition under Section 34 was filed beyond the period of 3
months plus 30 days and therefore, was liable to be
rejected.
5. Having regard to the proviso to Section 34(3) of the
Act, the provisions of Section 5 of the Limitation Act,
1963 will not apply in regard to petitions under Section
34 of the Act. While Section 5 of the Limitation Act does
not place any outer limit in regard to the period of delay
that could be condoned, the proviso to sub-section (3) of
Section 34 of the Act places a limit on the period of
condonable delay by using the words ‗may entertain the
application within a further period of thirty days, but not
thereafter‘. Therefore, if a petition is filed beyond the
prescribed period of three months, the court has the
discretion to condone the delay only to an extent of thirty
days, provided sufficient cause is shown. Where a petition
is filed beyond three months plus thirty days, even if
sufficient cause is made out, the delay cannot be
condoned.‖
9.2. The same view was taken by this Court in P. Radha
Bai v. P. Ashok Kumar [P. Radha Bai v. P. Ashok Kumar,
(2019) 13 SCC 445 : (2018) 5 SCC (Civ) 773] wherein this
Court held as follows : (SCC pp. 457-58, para 33)
―33.2. The proviso to Section 34(3) enables a court to
entertain an application to challenge an award after the
three months' period is expired, but only within an
additional period of thirty dates, ―but not thereafter‖.
The use of the phrase ―but not thereafter‖ shows that the
120 days' period is the outer boundary for challenging an
award. If Section 17 were to be applied, the outer
boundary for challenging an award could go beyond 120
days. The phrase ―but not thereafter‖ would be rendered
redundant and otiose. This Court has consistently taken
this view that the words ―but not thereafter‖ in the
proviso of Section 34(3) of the Arbitration Act are of a
mandatory nature, and couched in negative terms, which
leaves no room for doubt. [State of H.P. v. Himachal
Techno Engineers [State of H.P. v. Himachal Techno
Board v. Subash Projects & Mktg. Ltd. [Assam Urban
Water Supply & Sewerage Board v. Subash Projects &

9.3. The observations of this Court in different decisions
relating to non-applicability of Section 5 of the Limitation
Act in condoning the delay and extending the limitation
prescribed under Section 34(3) of the 1996 Act was taken
note of by a Bench of three Hon'ble Judges of this Court with
approval, in Chintels (India) Ltd. v. Bhayana Builders (P)
Ltd. [Chintels (India) Ltd. v. Bhayana Builders (P) Ltd.,
34.    Therefore, one thing is clear that this Court does not have the
power to condone any delay which exceeds the statutory time limit
prescribed under Section 34(3) of the Arbitration Act. As a necessary
corollary, next important question that arises for consideration is that
whether the delivery of the arbitral award to one Mr. Shrey Baxi
constitutes as a delivery to the Petitioner, so as to bring in the bar
envisaged under Section 34(3) of the Arbitration Act?
35.    At this stage, it is pertinent to refer to Sections 2(h) and 31(5) of
the Arbitration Act. These Sections read as under:
―2. Definitions.—(1) In this Part, unless the context
(h) ―party‖ means a party to an arbitration agreement.
31. Form and contents of arbitral award.—(1) An arbitral
award shall made in writing and shall be signed by the
members of the arbitral tribunal.
(5) After the arbitral award is made, a signed copy shall be
delivered to each party.‖
36.    In Union of India vs. Tecco Trichy Engineers & Contractors,
(2005) 4 SCC 239, the question which arose before the Hon‟ble Supreme
Court was that whether delivery of the impugned arbitral award to the
General Manager of Railways will constitute as valid delivery in terms of
Section 31(5) of the Arbitration Act, when the party before the Arbitrator
was the Chief Engineer? The Hon‟ble Supreme Court while answering
the question in the negative laid down the following proposition of law:
“6. Form and contents of the arbitral award are provided
by Section 31 of the Act. The arbitral award drawn up in the
manner prescribed by Section 31 of the Act has to be signed
and dated. According to sub-section (5), ―after the arbitral
award is made, a signed copy shall be delivered to each
party‖. The term “party” is defined by clause (h) of Section
2 of the Act as meaning “a party to an arbitration
agreement”. The definition is to be read as given unless the
context otherwise requires. Under sub-section (3) of Section
34 the limitation of 3 months commences from the date on
which ―the party making that application‖ had received the
arbitral award. We have to see what is the meaning to be
assigned to the term ―party‖ and ―party making the
application‖ for setting aside the award in the context of the
State or a department of the Government, more so a large
organisation like the Railways.
7. It is well known that the Ministry of Railways has a
very large area of operation covering several divisions,
having different divisional heads and various departments
within the division, having their own departmental heads.
The General Manager of the Railways is at the very apex of
the division with the responsibility of taking strategic
decisions, laying down policies of the organisation, giving
administrative instructions and issuing guidelines in the
organisation. He is from elite managerial cadre which runs
the entire organisation of his division with different
departments, having different departmental heads. The day-
to-day management and operations of different departments
rests with different departmental heads. The departmental
head is directly connected and concerned with the
departmental functioning and is alone expected to know the
progress of the matter pending before the Arbitral Tribunal
concerning his department. He is the person who knows
exactly where the shoe pinches, whether the arbitral award
is adverse to the department's interest. The departmental
head would naturally be in a position to know whether the
arbitrator has committed a mistake in understanding the
department's line of submissions and the grounds available
to challenge the award. He is aware of the factual aspect of
the case and also the factual and legal aspects of the
questions involved in the arbitration proceedings. It is also a
known fact and the Court can take judicial notice of it that
there are several arbitration proceedings pending
consideration concerning affairs of the Railways before
arbitration. The General Manager, with executive workload
of the entire division cannot be expected to know all the
niceties of the case pending before the Arbitral Tribunal or
for that matter the arbitral award itself and to take a
decision as to whether the arbitral award deserves
challenge, without proper assistance of the departmental
head. The General Manager, being the head of the division,
at best is only expected to take final decision whether the
arbitral award is to be challenged or not on the basis of the
advice and the material placed before him by the person
concerned with arbitration proceedings. Taking a final
decision would be possible only if the subject-matter of
challenge, namely, the arbitral award is known to the
departmental head, who is directly concerned with the
subject-matter as well as arbitral proceedings. In large
organisations like the Railways, ―party‖ as referred to in
Section 2(h) read with Section 34(3) of the Act has to be
construed to be a person directly connected with and
involved in the proceedings and who is in control of the
proceedings before the arbitrator.
8. The delivery of an arbitral award under sub-section (5)
of Section 31 is not a matter of mere formality. It is a matter
of substance. It is only after the stage under Section 31 has
passed that the stage of termination of arbitral proceedings
within the meaning of Section 32 of the Act arises. The
delivery of arbitral award to the party, to be effective, has to
be ―received‖ by the party. This delivery by the Arbitral
Tribunal and receipt by the party of the award sets in motion
several periods of limitation such as an application for
correction and interpretation of an award within 30 days
under Section 33(1), an application for making an additional
award under Section 33(4) and an application for setting
aside an award under Section 34(3) and so on. As this
delivery of the copy of award has the effect of conferring
certain rights on the party as also bringing to an end the
right to exercise those rights on expiry of the prescribed
period of limitation which would be calculated from that
date, the delivery of the copy of award by the Tribunal and
the receipt thereof by each party constitutes an important
stage in the arbitral proceedings.
9. In the context of a huge organisation like the Railways,
the copy of the award has to be received by the person who
has knowledge of the proceedings and who would be the best
person to understand and appreciate the arbitral award and
also to take a decision in the matter of moving an
application under sub-section (1) or (5) of Section 33 or
under sub-section (1) of Section 34.‖
37.    Though, the aforesaid decision of the Hon‟ble Supreme Court dealt
with the meaning of ‗party‘ in the context of a larger organization, but the
general principles laid down cannot be ignored and are of a vital
importance in the facts and circumstances of the present case.
Ltd., (2012) 9 SCC 496, the Hon'ble Supreme Court was confronted with
a question as to whether delivery of an arbitral award on agent or
advocate of a party would constitute as a proper delivery in terms of
Sections 31(5) and 34(3)? The Hon‟ble Supreme Court while answering
the question in the negative laid down the following proposition of law:
―15. Having taken note of the submissions advanced on
behalf of the respective parties and having particular regard
to the expression ―party‖ as defined in Section 2(1)(h) of the
1996 Act read with the provisions of Sections 31(5) and
34(3) of the 1996 Act, we are not inclined to interfere with
the decision [Karmyogi Shelters (P) Ltd. v. Benarsi Krishna
Committee, AIR 2010 Del 156] of the Division Bench of the
Delhi High Court impugned in these proceedings. The
expression ―party‖ has been amply dealt with in Tecco
Trichy Engineers case [(2005) 4 SCC 239] and also in ARK
Builders (P) Ltd. case [(2011) 4 SCC 616 : (2011) 2 SCC
(Civ) 413] , referred to hereinabove. It is one thing for an
advocate to act and plead on behalf of a party in a
proceeding and it is another for an advocate to act as the
party himself. The expression ―party‖, as defined in Section
2(1)(h) of the 1996 Act, clearly indicates a person who is a
party to an arbitration agreement. The said definition is not
qualified in any way so as to include the agent of the party to
such agreement. Any reference, therefore, made in Section
31(5) and Section 34(2) of the 1996 Act can only mean the
party himself and not his or her agent, or advocate
empowered to act on the basis of a vakalatnama. In such
circumstances, proper compliance with Section 31(5) would
mean delivery of a signed copy of the arbitral award on the
party himself and not on his advocate, which gives the party
concerned the right to proceed under Section 34(3) of the
aforesaid Act.
16. The view taken in Pushpa Devi Bhagat case [(2006) 5
SCC 566] is in relation to the authority given to an advocate
to act on behalf of a party to a proceeding in the
proceedings itself, which cannot stand satisfied where a
provision such as Section 31(5) of the 1996 Act is concerned.
The said provision clearly indicates that a signed copy of the
award has to be delivered to the party. Accordingly, when a
copy of the signed award is not delivered to the party
himself, it would not amount to compliance with the
provisions of Section 31(5) of the Act. The other decision
cited by Mr Ranjit Kumar in Nilkantha Sidramappa
Ningashetti case [AIR 1962 SC 666 : (1962) 2 SCR 551] was
rendered under the provisions of the Arbitration Act, 1940,
which did not have a provision similar to the provisions of
Section 31(5) of the 1996 Act. The said decision would,
therefore, not be applicable to the facts of this case also.‖
39.    Therefore, the proposition laid down in Tecco Trichy Engineers &
Contractors (supra) in the context of large bodies was even extended to
„agents‘ or „advocates‘ of parties.
40.    In State of Maharashtra v. ARK Builders (P) Ltd., (2011) 4 SCC
616, the Hon‟ble Supreme Court was dealing with the question as to
whether the period of limitation for making an application under Section
34 is to be reckoned from the date on which a copy of the award is
received by the objector by any means and from any source, or it would
start running from the date a signed copy of the award is delivered to him
by the arbitrator? The Hon'ble Supreme Court laid down the following
principles of law:
―13. Section 34 of the Act then provides for filing an
application for setting aside an arbitral award, and sub-
section (3) of that section lays down the period of limitation
for making the application in the following terms:
―34.Application for setting aside arbitral award.—(1)
Recourse to a court against an arbitral award may be
made only by an application for setting aside such award
in accordance with sub-section (2) and sub-section (3).
(3) An application for setting aside may not be made
after three months have elapsed from the date on which
the party making that application had received the
arbitral award or, if a request had been made under
Section 33, from the date on which that request had been
disposed of by the Arbitral Tribunal:
Provided that if the court is satisfied that the applicant
was prevented by sufficient cause from making the
application within the said period of three months it may
entertain the application within a further period of thirty
days, but not thereafter.
The expression ―party making that application
had received the arbitral award‖ (emphasis supplied)
cannot be read in isolation and it must be understood in light
of what is said earlier in Section 31(5) that requires a signed
copy of the award to be delivered to each party. Reading the
two provisions together it is quite clear that the limitation
prescribed under Section 34(3) would commence only from
the date a signed copy of the award is delivered to the party
making the application for setting it aside.
14. We are supported in our view by the decision of this
Court in Union of India v. Tecco Trichy Engineers &
Contractors [(2005) 4 SCC 239] ; in SCC para 8 of the
decision it was held and observed as follows: (SCC p. 243)
―8. The delivery of an arbitral award under sub-
section (5) of Section 31 is not a matter of mere formality.
It is a matter of substance. It is only after the stage under
Section 31 has passed that the stage of termination of
arbitral proceedings within the meaning of Section 32 of
the Act arises. The delivery of arbitral award to the party,
to be effective, has to be ‗received‘ by the party. This
delivery by the Arbitral Tribunal and receipt by the party
of the award sets in motion several periods of limitation
such as an application for correction and interpretation
of an award within 30 days under Section 33(1), an
application for making an additional award under
Section 33(4) and an application for setting aside an
award under Section 34(3) and so on. As this delivery of
the copy of award has the effect of conferring certain
rights on the party as also bringing to an end the right to
exercise those rights on expiry of the prescribed period of
limitation which would be calculated from that date, the
delivery of the copy of award by the Tribunal and the
receipt thereof by each party constitutes an important
stage in the arbitral proceedings.‖
15. The highlighted portion of the judgment extracted
above, leaves no room for doubt that the period of limitation
prescribed under Section 34(3) of the Act would start
running only from the date a signed copy of the award is
delivered to/received by the party making the application for
setting it aside under Section 34(1) of the Act. The legal
position on the issue may be stated thus. If the law
prescribes that a copy of the order/award is to be
communicated, delivered, dispatched, forwarded, rendered
or sent to the parties concerned in a particular way and in
case the law also sets a period of limitation for challenging
the order/award in question by the aggrieved party, then
the period of limitation can only commence from the date
on which the order/award was received by the party
concerned in the manner prescribed by the law.‖
41.   Therefore, the principle of law which was laid down by this
decision is that the signed arbitral award must have been delivered to the
party to the arbitration, in the manner which is prescribed under the
Arbitration Act. This Court has gone through the Employment Agreement
dated 15th February 2010 and it is clear that the Employment Agreement
was executed by Ms. Monika Oli individually and not in the capacity of
her being a shareholder of Knowledge Planet LLC. This Court has also
gone through the DHL Express Shipments which notes that the arbitral
award has been delivered to one Mr. Shrey Baxi. The Respondent has
vehemently pleaded that delivery to Mr. Baxi constitutes as delivery to
the Petitioner as the Petitioner has admitted to be a minority shareholder
in Knowledge Planet LLC and Mr. Baxi as an employee of Knowledge
Planet LLC. The Petitioner on the other hand has taken a stand that Mr.
Baxi has not accepted the delivery on behalf of the Petitioner and hence,
does not constitute as a valid delivery envisaged under Section 34(3) read
with Section 31(5) of the Arbitration Act. In the opinion of this Court, no
valid delivery of arbitral award has been affected in the facts and
circumstances of the case. The decision of the Calcutta High Court in
Manohar Lal & Co. vs. Axis Bank Ltd., (2018) SCC OnLine Cal
15745, is not of any help to the Respondent as in that case the award was
delivered to the wife of the Petitioner therein who received it on behalf of
her husband, and was delivered at the appropriate address of the
Petitioner therein. The principles qua delivery of arbitral award can be
summarized as follows:
a) The word ‘party’ in Section 34(3) means party to the
arbitration proceedings and does not include an agent of the
party as well.
b) The delivery to be effective and in consonance with the
legislative scheme of Arbitration Act must be made to a
person who has direct knowledge of the arbitral proceedings
and who would be the best person to understand and
appreciate the arbitral award being connected with the
dispute at hand.
42.    Learned senior counsel for the Petitioner has taken a plea that
Section 3 of the Arbitration Act is not applicable to the facts and
circumstances of the present case. This Court is unable to agree with this
submission advanced by the learned senior counsel. At the outset, it is
necessary to reproduce Section 3:-
―3. Receipt of written communications.—(1) Unless
otherwise agreed by the parties,—
(a) any written communication is deemed to have been
received if it is delivered to the addressee personally or at
his place of business, habitual residence or mailing address,
(b) if none of the places referred to in clause (a) can be
found after making a reasonable inquiry, a written
communication is deemed to have been received if it is sent
to the addressee's last known place of business, habitual
residence or mailing address by registered letter or by any
other means which provides a record of the attempt to
deliver it.
(2) The communication is deemed to have been received on
the day it is so delivered.
(3) This section does not apply to written communications in
respect of proceedings of any judicial authority.
43.   The UNCITRAL Model Law on the International
Commercial Arbitration: A Commentary on Article 31 clearly
negates the submissions advanced by the learned senior counsel for
the Petitioner in the following words:
―Paragraph 4 does not itself specify further formalities for
the ‗delivery‘ of signed copies of the award. Moreover, it is
silent as to which person or entity is burdened with the
obligation of delivering it to the parties. Given the centrality
of notification in the beginning and end of the arbitral
process and the vast range of practices across jurisdictions,
article 3(1)(a) of the Model Law provides sensible guidance,
unless the parties have otherwise agreed, as follows:
… any written communication is deemed to have been
received if it is delivered to the addressee personally or if it
is delivered at his place of business, habitual residence or
mailing address; if none of these can be found after making
a reasonable inquiry, a written communication is deemed to
have been received if it is sent to the addressee‘s last-known
place of business, habitual residence or mailing address by
registered letter or any other means which provides a record
of the attempt to deliver it.
In fact, although not specifically spelt out as a ground for
annulling the award, it certainly cannot be considered
binding until such time as it is delivered to the parties
through an official channel in accordance with the law of the
lex arbitri or the parties‘ chosen institutional rules…..
44.   The UNCITRAL Model Law on the International
Commercial Arbitration: A Commentary on Article 3 gives the
following meaning to a ‗Party‘s Place of Business‘:
―The most appropriate definition of a party‘s ‗place of
business‘, for the strict purposes of article 3, is not
necessarily the legal seat of a party, or its principal place of
business, or head office.55 Given that the objective of article
3 is effective receipt of a written communication – and in this
light it allows even for personal delivery – the place of
business may be different from the seat of the party, if its
actual place of business is elsewhere. In transnational
arbitration, a company ordinarily seated in country A may
have to incorporate again in country B, which is where the
contract is to be performed. The new company premises in
country B are merely a representative office, with its
principal seat and place of key operations remaining in
country A. For the purposes of arbitral proceedings,
however, the party‘s place of business is the address in
country B, as long as this remains an effective address
during the arbitral proceedings.
We have already seen that in CLOUT Case 1448 the
claimant sought to identify the defendant‘s place of business
through the Russian register of foreign companies. As a
matter of caution, he was advised to look in the similar
register of the defendant‘s country of origin (Turkey)
because its accreditation in the Russian register had
expired.56 In case of multiple places of business, the
prevailing one is that which has featured the most in the
parties‘ transactions (i.e. by reason of prior mail exchanges,
effective letterheads, appearance in official website, past
place of meetings, registered company address, etc.).57 In
general, substance over form is the best determinant of a
party‘s place of business.”
45.    However, in the present case, the Respondent has failed to bring
anything on record to substantiate that the delivery of the award was
made to the Petitioner, apart from the delivery to Mr. Shrey Baxi. In the
opinion of this Court, this cannot constitute as an effective delivery to the
Petitioner more so, when in the arbitral dispute, the Petitioner was
individually concerned and that the dispute did not pertain to her position
at Knowledge Planet LLC. This Court is conscious that it has been close
to 8 years since the award has been passed and a pedantic approach ought
not to be taken, however, justice cannot be thwarted only because
substantial time has elapsed when there is nothing on record to
substantiate compliance with the mandatory provisions of Section 34(3)
read with Section 31(5) of the Arbitration Act particularly, in view of the
decision in Benarsi Krishna Committee (supra). This court is conscious
of its duty to ensure compliance with the principles of natural justice and
when an award has been passed without complying with the mandatory
principles of natural justice, this Court being the custodian of rights and
liberties of parties has to take its guard to correct the infirmities which
have already been carried out. Nothing has been brought in record to
portray that Mr. Baxi had accepted the arbitral award on behalf of the
Petitioner. Therefore, delivery to the employee of an entity in which the
Petitioner is a shareholder but the arbitration dispute did not pertain to
that entity, would not constitute as a proper delivery in terms of the
46.   Next question which requires adjudication is that:
II. Whether notice under Section 21 of the Arbitration Act was
given to the Petitioner? If not, can the entire arbitral
proceedings be set aside on this account?
47.   The Petitioner has submitted that no effective notice under Section
21 of the Arbitration Act has been served upon her. Before dealing with
this question, it is necessary to reproduce Section 21 of the Arbitration
"21. Commencement of arbitral proceedings.—Unless
otherwise agreed by the parties, the arbitral proceedings in
respect of a particular dispute commence on the date on
which a request for that dispute to be referred to arbitration
is received by the respondent.‖
48.   The question as to whether compliance with Section 21 is
mandatory or directory is no longer res integra. Recently, a Division
Bench of this Court has categorically held that compliance with Section
21 is mandatory in nature and not a matter of choice. The relevant portion
of the judgment rendered in Shriram Transport Finance Co. Ltd. vs.
Shri Narendra Singh, (2022) SCC OnLine Del 3412, is reproduced
“25. A perusal of the Arbitral record as filed by the
Appellant Company shows that a letter dated 20.09.2018
was addressed by the Appellant Company to the Respondent
stating that in the event, the payment due is not made within
7 days, the disputes ―stand referred to Arbitration‖ and
further that the Appellant Company shall initiate Arbitral
proceedings. The relevant portion of the said letter is
―7. Hence kindly take Note that you addresses are
advised to pay and clear entire outstanding dues
amounting to Rs. 470248/- as on date 12/09/2018 and
also with accrued interest/Penal all other charges till the
date of repayment/realization and charges, within 7 days
on the receipt of this notice, failing which company will
refer the matter for arbitration.
8. If you have failed to comply with the requisitions
contained in notices, the disputes, differences and claims
shall be deemed to have arisen under the said
Agreement and the said disputes, differences and claim
shall stand referred to the Arbitration.
9. If you are failed to pay the outstanding amount as
per out [sic : our] loan agreement ARTICAL [sic :
Article] No. 15. We have a right to initiate arbitration
processing. So we will initiate the arbitration
[Emphasis is ours]
26. From a plain reading of this letter, two things are
(i) The letter dated 20.09.2018 merely states that the
Appellant Company has a right to initiate Arbitration
proceedings so they will initiate such proceedings;
(ii) This letter does not name any person as an
Arbitrator, nor the fact that the person is being
appointed as an Arbitrator in terms of the procedure
set forth in the Loan Agreement.
27. A week later, a letter dated 27.09.2018, was sent by
the Appellant Company to the Arbitrator appointing him as
the ―Sole Arbitrator to adjudicate the disputes and
differences between Shriram Transport Finance Co. Ltd. and
Mr Narender Singh (Hirer) and pass the award.‖ This letter
was neither marked to the Respondent nor is there any
averment by the Appellant Company that the letter dated
27.09.2018 was in fact sent to the Respondent.
28. From a perusal of the Arbitral Award, it is also
apparent that the letter dated 27.09.2018 was sent by the
Appellant Company to the Arbitrator, by hand, through one
Mr Tekchand Sharma, Attorney for the Appellant Company.
29. In order to deal with the objection of the Appellant
Company, the notice under Section 21 of the Act was sent,
we would need to refer to the said provision. Section 21 of
the Act, which sets forth the date of commencement of
Arbitral proceedings, reads as follows:
―21. Commencement of Arbitral proceedings. - unless
otherwise agreed by the parties, the Arbitral proceedings in
respect of a particular dispute commence on the date on
which a request for that dispute to be referred to Arbitration
is received by the respondent.‖
30. A plain reading of this Section shows that Arbitral
proceedings commence on the date on which the request for
the dispute to be referred to Arbitration is received by the
concerned Respondent. Therefore, the commencement of
Arbitral proceedings is incumbent on the ―receipt of such
request or notice‖. If no notice is received by the concerned
Respondent, there is no commencement of Arbitral
proceedings at all. Emphasis here is also made to the fact
that the notice should not only be ―sent‖ but also that the
notice should be ―received‖ for such request for
commencement.
31. Section 21 will have to be read with Section 34 of the
Act. Section 34 (2) (iii) provides that an award may be set
aside, in the event, where the party appointing the Arbitrator
has not given proper notice of the appointment of an
Arbitrator or the Arbitral proceedings.
32. The judgment in Alupro Building case (supra) has
aptly explained the relevance of a notice under Section 21 of
the Act. It was held that the Act does not contemplate
unilateral appointment of an Arbitrator by one of the parties,
there has to be a consensus for such appointment and as
such, the notice under Section 21 of the Act serves an
important purpose of facilitating such a consensus on the
appointment of an Arbitrator. It was further held in Alupro
Building case (supra) that the parties may opt to waive the
requirement of notice under Section 21 of the Act. However,
in the absence of such a waiver, this provision must be given
full effect to.
33. We are in agreement with the principles as expressed in
the decision of Alupro Building case (supra), which are
enunciated below:
(i) The party to the Arbitration Agreement against whom a
claim is made should know what the claims are. The
notice under Section 21 of the Act provides an
opportunity to such party to point out if some of the
claims are time barred or barred by law or untenable in
fact or if there are counter-claims.
(ii) Where the parties have agreed on a procedure for
appointment, whether or not such procedure has been
followed, will not be known to the other party unless such
a notice is received.
(iii) It is necessary for the party making an appointment to
let the other party know in advance the name of the
person who it proposes to appoint as an Arbitrator. This
will ensure that the suitability of the person is known to
the opposite party including whether or not the person is
qualified or disqualified to act as an Arbitrator for the
various reasons set forth in the Act. Thus, the notice
facilitates the parties in arriving at a consensus for
appointing an Arbitrator.
(iv) Unless such notice of commencement of Arbitral
proceedings is issued, a party seeking reference of
disputes to Arbitration upon failure of the other party to
adhere to such request will be unable to proceed under
Section 11(6) of the Act. Further, the party sending the
notice of commencement may be able to proceed under
the provisions of Sub-section 5 of Section 11 of the Act
for the appointment of an Arbitrator if such notice does
not evoke any response.‖
49.   In the present case, the Respondent has relied on legal notice dated
6th November 2013 to contend that the same is equivalent to a notice
under Section 21 of the Arbitration Act. It is imperative to reproduce the
contents of the above-mentioned legal notice:-
Under the instruction & authority and on behalf of my client
company M/S CL Educate Ltd having its Regd Office at R-
90, Greater Kailash –1, New Delhi – 110048 through its

collect fees from the students in the name of and on behalf of
my client company and further to deposit the fee so collected
in the bank account of my client company.
5.That you were also liable to enter all the details pertaining
to enrolment of students, collection of fee, balance fee etc. in
the ERP system of my client company provided on line.
6.That on reconciliation of the bank statement and ERP
entries made by yourself, it has been come to the notice of
my client company that you did not deposit in the bank
account of my client company an amount of AED 625,775/-
(Six Hundred Twenty Five Thousand Seven Hundred and
Seventy Five only), despite the fact that this amount was
collected by yourself from the students as per the records
available in the ERP system, entries wherein were made by
you only.
7.That you have even failed to deposit this amount in my
client company‘s bank account despite repeated verbal as
well as written reminders/communications made by my client
company thereby demanding to pay this outstanding amount
which was received by you as a trustee of my client
company.
8.That further, you have also collected the installment of fee
from the students due as on 31.1.2013 on behalf of my client
company. As per the ERP records made by yourself in the
ERP system of my client company an amount of AED
1,392,200/- was due on this account. Though you have fully
collected this amount from the students but did not deposit in
the bank account of my client company even after repeated
reminders by my client company. Even my client company
sent you a statement of accounts alognwith a list of students
and amount due, duly audited by third party auditors,
thereby demanding to pay the same but of no avail.
9.That as per the records held with my client company you
made the last student enrolment entry in the ERP system on
15.12.2012 and no enrolments have been entered into the
system thereafter. My client company has not only learnt but
got concrete piece of evidence that you have been enrolling
the students upto 31.1.2013 under the agreement and in the
name of my client company and did not make the entries of
students enrolled after 15.12.2012 in the system, rather
enrolled these students in the name of Knowledge Planet
LLC (a competitive company which is being managed and
run by you for the purpose of starting a competitive business
that to of my client company in gross violation of the terms
and conditions of the agreement dated 15.2.2010) despite the
fact that these students were enrolled and fee was collected
by yourself in the name and on behalf of my client company.
10.That all these acts on your part amounts to criminal
breach of trust as well as misappropriation of funds, which
makes you liable for criminal action apart from recovery of
money by my client company.
11. That further, as per the agreement you were liable to
give a written confirmation with 30 days advance notice
regarding non-continuation of the contract and in case of
failure to issue such notice under clause 8 of the agreement,
it was automatic renewal of agreement and hence my client
company was under belief that you will be continuing with
the agreement and as such they were deprived of the
opportunity to find out a suitable replacement well within
time and thus suffered huge business losses, which though
can not be quantified in term of money but the same is
determined as AED 50,000/- for the purpose of claim, which
you are liable to pay to my client company.
12. Further more, it has also come to the notice of my client
company alongwith relevant evidence that even after
31.1.2013 you have been mis-representing yourself as a
service partner/provider of my client company with sole
intent to mis-guide the parents/students and to lure them to
take admission with your new named entity Knowledge
Planet LLC under the guise that you are a service provider
of my client company and thus caused huge losses to my
client company, for which you are liable to pay damages to
my client company.
13. Further as per the term of the agreement, you were
under legal obligation not to start a direct competing
business that to of my client company in the territory of
United Arab Emirates for a period of 01 year from the date
of termination of agreement, but whereas you immediately
on alleged termination of agreement (through no
communication was made as per the requirement under the
agreement) joined with M/S Knowledge Planet LLC and
started a competing business in gross violation of terms and
conditions of the agreement.
14.Further, you have not only started a competing and
similar business in association of the said Knowledge Planet
LLC but also started using the data/information, manuals
etc. pertaining to my client company which were in your
possession and you did not hand over the same to my client
company till date despite repeated reminders by my client
company. You have been using this data/information,
manuals with malafide intentions and thereby making
wrongful gains for yourself and wrongful losses to my client
company and thus made liable to yourself to pay damages to
my client company.
15. That further more, my client enrolled an employee
named Mr. Yogeshwar Singh Batyal and got him issued visa
in its name since you were not having any licence to get the
visa for employees in your name. This employee was
required for the purpose of discharging your
duties/obligations under the agreement and as such he was
paid all his salary and other emoluments by you. But, with
malafide intentions, you not only failed to clear all the dues
on account of salary & allowances of said Mr. Yogeshwar
Singh Batyal but also failed to complete the formalities for
cancellation of his visa from the Dubai authorities and as
such my client company was compelled to pay an amount of
AED 18120/- (AED 2828 for cancellation of visa and AED
15292 for settlement of his wage account) on account of
settlement of his dues as well getting his visa cancelled,
which you are liable to pay to my client company.
16. That at the time of taking over the operations of study
center of my client company, my client company‘s then
Centre Manager, Mr. Akhilesh Jha, handed over to you his
mobile Number 00971-50-4515576, which was used for the
company‘s business purposes and it was also agreed that
you shall be regularly paying all the dues pertaining to this
mobile number, but you with malafide intention did not pay
the bill of said mobile number amounting to AED 4300/- as a
result not only this mobile number was blocked by the
service provider but also the other mobile number 00971-50-
1487045 held by said Mr. Akhilesh Jha of my client company
was also blocked by the service provider, due to which my
client company was/is unable to avail banking facilities
through phone banking.
17.In view of the above facts, you are hereby called upon to :
a. Pay an amount of AED 625,775/- (Six Hundred Twenty Five
Thousand Seven Hundred and Seventy Five only on account of
short deposit of fee collected by you in the name of my client from
b. Pay an amount of AED 1,392,200/- on account of fee collected
by you against the installment due as on 31.1.2013 and did not
deposit in the bank account of my client company.
c. Pay an amount of AED 50,000/- on account of losses suffered by
my client company due to non-communication by you regarding
termination of agreement;
d. Pay an amount of AED 1,000,000/- on account of damages for
starting a same/similar business in violation of terms of the
agreement and unauthorizedly using data/information, manuals
etc. pertaining to my client company;
e. Pay an amount of AED 18120/- on account of settlement of wage
account and cancellation of visa of said Mr. Yogeshwar Singh
Batyal by my client company;
f. Pay an amount of AED 4300/- on account of payment of
outstanding dues of bill in respect of mobile No 00971-50-4515576
held by Mr. Akhilesh Jha, an employee and erstwhile center
manager of Dubai office of my client company;
g. To render the account of profits made by you since 15.12.2012
by enrolling the students under the mis-representation made by you
that you are a service provider of my client company; and h.
Immediately stop using for your wrongful gains the
data/information, manual etc. pertaining to my client company,
return the data/information, manual etc. to my client company and
also to give an undertaking not to use any data/information,
manuals pertaining to my client company, in any manner,
whatsoever.
That in case you fail to comply with the above legal
demands of my client company as stipulated in para 17 (a)
to (h) hereinabove, within a period of 10 days from the date
of receipt of this legal demand notice, I have definite
instructions from my client company to proceed legally
against you, as deemed fit, including but not limited to
lodging criminal complaint before the appropriate
authorities as well as to refer the dispute for arbitration as
provided under the agreement and you shall be solely
responsible for the cost and consequences. Further, you
are also liable to pay cost of legal charges incurred by my
client company for issuance of this legal notice amounting
to Rs.20,000/-. A copy of this legal notice is being retained
in my office for further necessary action.
50.    This Court has carefully perused the legal notice and is unable to
come to a conclusion that this ‗Legal Demand cum Cease/Desist Notice‘
can qualify as a notice invoking arbitration under Section 21 of the Act.
This Court says so primarily for two reasons:
a) This letter merely states that the Respondent has a right to initiate
Arbitration proceedings in future, but does not intend to do so at
b) This letter does not name any person as an Arbitrator, nor the fact
that the person is being appointed as an Arbitrator in terms of the
Employment Agreement has been mentioned.
51.    Other things which have to be taken into consideration before
coming to any conclusion is that whether the correspondences which have
been exchanged between the parties either pre-arbitration or post-
arbitration can be said to constitute sufficient notice to the Petitioner,
thus ensuring compliance with the statutory dictum envisaged under
52.    It is not disputed that a pre-arbitration legal notice dated 6th
November 2013 (as discussed above) was received by the Petitioner
which, as held above, does not constitute a notice under Section 21 of the
Arbitration Act. Apart from this notice, the Petitioner has admitted the
receipt of the email dated 5th June 2014 from the Arbitrator to the
Petitioner which states that the arbitration proceedings were deferred in
view of the Delhi Bar Elections. The Respondent has claimed that other
communications were also made to the Petitioner which include first, a
letter dated January 2014 pertaining to appointment of Arbitrator;
secondly, a notice dated 10th March 2014, stating commencement of
arbitration (which was directed to be resend along with order dated 23rd
September 2014 to the respondent and the courier receipt of same is
claimed to be filed on 1st November 2014).
53.    This Court has carefully perused the documents on record,
especially the notice dated 10th March 2014 by way of which the consent
of the Arbitrator was recorded and which stated commencement of
arbitration, but this Court is unable to find any documentary evidence on
record to satisfy its conscience that this notice was ever served upon the
Petitioner, by post or by email, as only speed post receipts evidencing
delivery to the Respondent herein have been brought on record.
Accordingly, this Court is satisfied that a proper notice under Section 21
of the Arbitration Act was not served upon the Petitioner and the dictum
of Shriram Transport (supra) is fully applicable to the facts and
circumstances of the present case.
54.    Another question that arises for consideration is that:
III. Whether the impugned arbitral award is liable to be set
aside on the ground that the Arbitrator has wrongly applied
the Indian law as the substantive/governing law of the
55.    The Petitioner has contended that the substantive law of the
contract was the UAE Federal Labour Law whereas, the Arbitrator has
relied on Indian law as the substantive law of the contract, as the
Arbitrator has relied on Indian laws and judicial pronouncements while
arriving at his findings. It has also been argued that under the UAE
Federal Labour Law, employment and/or labour disputes are not capable
of resolution by arbitration.
56.    The position pertaining to various laws governing an arbitration
proceeding is no longer res integra and has been authoritatively dealt by
judicial pronouncements and has also been dealt by various acclaimed
authors around the globe. Before adverting to these decisions, it is
necessary to refer to the relevant clauses in the Employment Agreement
governing the parties.
This Employment Contract and the Employment shall be
governed by and construed in accordance with the United
Arab Emirates Federal Labour Law for the Private Sector
(being Federal Law No. 8 of 1980 as amended) only until
Sharjah regulatory authority puts into place separate
regulations concerning employment in Sharjah at which time
such separate regulations will govern this Employment
Contract and the Employment.
Any dispute arising under this agreement will be referred for
arbitration to a sole arbitrator appointed by the Managing
Director of Career Launcher India Ltd. and having its
jurisdiction/place at New Delhi, India.‖
57.   Enka Insaat Ve Sanayi AS vs. OOO Insurance Company Chubb,
[2020] UKSC 38, is a watershed decision explaining the different laws
governing a contract which also contains an arbitration clause. The
Supreme Court of United Kingdom has beautifully explained the position
of law in the following words:
―43. It is rare for the law governing an arbitration clause to
be specifically identified (either in the arbitration clause
itself or elsewhere in the contract). It is common, however,
in a contract which has connections with more than one
country (or territory with its own legal system) to find a
clause specifying the law which is to govern the contract. A
typical clause of this kind states: ―This Agreement shall be
governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of
[name of legal system].‖ Where the contract also contains
an arbitration clause, it is natural to interpret such a
governing law clause, in the absence of good reason to the
contrary, as applying to the arbitration clause for the simple
reason that the arbitration clause is part of the contract
which the parties have agreed is to be governed by the
specified system of law.
45. There is a considerable body of English case law which
proceeds on the assumption that a choice of law for the
contract will normally apply to an arbitration clause in the
contract. The approach was summarised by Colman J in
Sonatrach Petroleum Corpn (BVI) v Ferrell International
Ltd [2002] 1 All ER (Comm) 627 at para 32:
―Where the substantive contract contains an express
choice of law, but the agreement to arbitrate contains
no separate express choice of law, the latter
agreement will normally be governed by the body of
law expressly chosen to govern the substantive
contract.‖
46. It has not generally been considered to make any
difference in this regard that the arbitration clause provides
for arbitration to take place in a different country from the
country whose law has been chosen to govern the contract.
Examples of decisions in which a choice of law clause in the
contract has been treated as applying to the arbitration
agreement despite the seat of arbitration being in a different
jurisdiction include: Cia Maritima Zorroza SA v Sesostris
653; Union of India v McDonnell Douglas Corpn [1993] 2
Lloyd‘s Rep 48, 49-50; Sumitomo Heavy Industries Ltd v Oil
and Natural Gas Commission [1994] 1 Lloyd‘s Rep 45, 57;
Deutz AG v General Electric Co (Thomas J, 14 April 2000)
at p 17; Peterson Farms Inc v C&M Farming Ltd [2004]
EWHC 121 (Comm); [2004] 1 Lloyd‘s Rep 603, paras 43-
46; Leibinger v Stryker Trauma GmbH [2005] EWHC 690
(Comm), para 38; and Svenska Petroleum Exploration AB v
Government of the Republic of Lithuania [2005] EWHC
2437 (Comm); [2006] 1 All ER (Comm) 731, paras 76-77.
58.    Redfern and Hunter: Law and Practice of International
Commercial Arbitration, 6th ed (2015) at para 3.12 states as
―Since the arbitration clause is only one of many clauses in
a contract, it might seem reasonable to assume that the law
chosen by the parties to govern the contract will also govern
the arbitration clause. If the parties expressly choose a
particular law to govern their agreement, why should some
other law - which the parties have not chosen - be applied to
only one of the clauses in the agreement, simply because it
happens to be the arbitration clause?‖
59.    Merkin on Arbitration Law, Issue 84 (2020), para 7.12,
―… even if there is no express contractual statement to that
effect, a choice of law clause for the entire agreement is
likely to be construed as extending to the arbitration clause.
There are numerous decisions to this effect … However, that
presumption may be ousted in appropriate circumstances
60.    Dicey, Morris & Collins on The Conflicts of Laws, 15th ed
(2012) at para 16-017: states as under:
―If there is an express choice of law to govern the contract
as a whole, the arbitration agreement may also be governed
by that law.‖
61.    The UK Supreme Court in Enka (supra) has also dealt with the
role of the law applicable to the seat of arbitration, i.e., the curial law in
the arbitration proceedings in the following manner:
―67. On this appeal Chubb Russia disputed the initial
premise that a choice of seat for an arbitration involves any
choice of law at all, procedural or substantive. Counsel for
Chubb Russia submitted that the application of the curial
law of the seat is something that follows automatically from
a choice of place of arbitration rather than being itself a
matter of choice. They cited as an analogy a hypothetical
case postulated by Redfern and Hunter: Law and Practice of
International Commercial Arbitration, 6th ed (2015), para
3.63, of an English motorist who takes her car to France.
Redfern and Hunter comment that:
―… it would be an odd use of language to say that
this notional motorist had opted for ‗French traffic
law‘; rather, she has chosen to go to France - and the
applicability of French law then follows
automatically. It is not a matter of choice.‖
68. We agree that it would be inapt to describe the tourist in
this example as having made a choice to be regulated by
French traffic law. But as Mr Dicker QC for Enka submitted,
it is difficult to conceive that a person‘s decision to visit
France might be informed by a desire to be governed by
French traffic law. By contrast, the nature and scope of the
jurisdiction exercised by the courts of a country over an
arbitration which has its seat there is a highly material
consideration in choosing a seat for the arbitration. That is
reinforced by the fact that the seat of an arbitration is a
legal concept rather than a physical one. A choice of place
as the seat does not dictate that hearings must be held, or
that any award must actually be issued, in that place. As the
Court of Appeal observed (at para 46), it is perfectly
possible to conduct an arbitration with an English seat at
any convenient location, anywhere in the world.
Furthermore, under section 53 of the Arbitration Act 1996,
unless otherwise agreed by the parties, where the seat of an
arbitration is in England and Wales, any award in the
proceedings shall be treated as made there, regardless of
where it was signed, despatched or delivered to any of the
parties (see also article 31(3) of the UNCITRAL Model Law
on International Commercial Arbitration adopted by the
United Nations Commission on International Trade Law on
21 June 1985). The point of agreeing a seat is to agree that
the law and courts of a particular country will exercise
control over an arbitration which has its seat in that country
to the extent provided for by that country‘s law. A choice of
seat can in these circumstances aptly be regarded as a
choice of the curial law.
69. As noted at the beginning of this judgment, however, the
curial law which applies to the arbitration process is
conceptually distinct from the law which governs the validity
and scope of the arbitration agreement. Whether a choice of
the curial law carries any implication that the parties
intended the same system of law to govern the arbitration
agreement - and, if so, the strength of any such implication -
must depend on the content of the relevant curial law.
70. In Carpatsky Petroleum Corpn v PJSC Ukrnafta [2020]
EWHC 769 (Comm); [2020] Bus LR 1284, the claimant
applied to enforce in England and Wales an arbitration
award made in Sweden. Enforcement was resisted on the
ground (among others) that there was no valid arbitration
agreement in the contract between the parties. This
argument depended on the assumption that the validity of the
arbitration agreement was governed by the law of Ukraine.
The contract provided for the ―law of substance of Ukraine‖
to apply ―on examination of disputes‖. Butcher J held (at
paras 67-71) that this was not a choice of Ukrainian law to
govern the arbitration agreement and that, in the
circumstances, the choice of Stockholm as the seat for any
arbitration demonstrated an implied choice that the validity
and interpretation of the arbitration agreement should be
governed by Swedish law. His reasons were that: (1) it was
reasonable to infer that the parties had deliberately chosen
a neutral forum to resolve their disputes and hence
“intended the law of that jurisdiction to determine issues as
to the validity and ambit of that choice”; and (2) by
choosing Sweden as the seat for the arbitration, the parties
agreed to the application of the Swedish Arbitration Act,
including section 48 which provides that, in the absence of
agreement on a choice of law to govern an arbitration
agreement with an international connection, the arbitration
agreement shall be governed by the law of the country in
which, by virtue of that agreement, the arbitration
proceedings have taken place or will take place. It follows
that, by providing for a Swedish seat, the parties were
impliedly agreeing that Swedish law should govern the
arbitration agreement.‖
62.    In international commercial arbitrations, it is a well-established
rule that if the parties opt to have the arbitration's seat in a specific nation,
that nation's rules governing arbitration proceedings will take effect and
its courts will have supervisory jurisdiction over the arbitration. This
Court is persuaded with the submissions advanced by the learned senior
counsel for the Petitioner that the Arbitrator has grossly erred in applying
Indian laws to govern and adjudicate upon the disputes arising between
the parties even when there was a specific agreement to the effect that the
Employment Agreement will be governed by the UAE Federal Labour
Law. Accordingly, the impugned arbitral award is unsustainable on this
ground as well.
63.    Now, it is necessary to determine what constitutes a violation of
the fundamental policy of Indian Law.
64.    In Associate Builders vs. Delhi Development Authority, (2015) 3
SCC 49, the Hon‟ble Supreme Court clarified the meaning and scope of
„Fundamental Policy of Indian Law‟ in the context of Section 34 of the
Arbitration Act in the following manner: ―
28. In a recent judgment, ONGC Ltd. v. Western Geco
International Ltd., 2014 (9) SCC 263, this Court added three
other distinct and fundamental juristic principles which must
be understood as a part and parcel of the fundamental policy
of Indian law. The Court held-
35. What then would constitute the ―fundamental
policy of Indian law is the question. The decision in
ONGC [ONGC Ltd. v. Saw Pipes Ltd., (2003) 5 SCC
705] does not elaborate that aspect. Even so, the
expression must, in our opinion, include all such
fundamental principles as providing a basis for
administration of justice and enforcement of law in
this country. Without meaning to exhaustively
enumerate the purport of the expression
―fundamental policy of Indian law, we may refer to
three distinct and fundamental juristic principles that
must necessarily be understood as a part and parcel
of the fundamental policy of Indian law. The first and
foremost is the principle that in every determination
whether by a court or other authority that affects the
rights of a citizen or leads to any civil consequences,
the court or authority concerned is bound to adopt
what is in legal parlance called a ―judicial approach
in the matter. The duty to adopt a judicial approach
arises from the very nature of the power exercised by
the court or the authority does not have to be
separately or additionally enjoined upon the fora
concerned. What must be remembered is that the
importance of a judicial approach in judicial and
quasi-judicial determination lies in the fact that so
long as the court, tribunal or the authority exercising
powers that affect the rights or obligations of the
parties before them shows fidelity to judicial
approach, they cannot act in an arbitrary, capricious
or whimsical manner. Judicial approach ensures that
the authority acts bona fide and deals with the subject
in a fair, reasonable and objective manner and that its
decision is not actuated by any extraneous
consideration. Judicial approach in that sense acts as
a check against flaws and faults that can render the
decision of a court, tribunal or authority vulnerable to
challenge.
38. Equally important and indeed fundamental to the
policy of Indian law is the principle that a court and
so also a quasi judicial authority must, while
determining the rights and obligations of parties
before it, do so in accordance with the principles of
natural justice. Besides the celebrated audi alteram
partem rule one of the facets of the principles of
natural justice is that the court/authority deciding the
matter must apply its mind to the attendant facts and
circumstances while taking a view one way or the
other. Non-application of mind is a defect that is fatal
to any adjudication. Application of mind is best
demonstrated by disclosure of the mind and disclosure
of mind is best done by recording reasons in support
of the decision which the court or authority is taking.
The requirement that an adjudicatory authority must
apply its mind is, in that view, so deeply embedded in
our jurisprudence that it can be described as a
fundamental policy of Indian law.
39. No less important is the principle now recognised
as a salutary juristic fundamental in administrative
law that a decision which is perverse or so irrational
that no reasonable person would have arrived at the
same will not be sustained in a court of law.
Perversity or irrationality of decisions is tested on the
touchstone      of      Wednesbury       principle     of
reasonableness. Decisions that fall short of the
standards of reasonableness are open to challenge in
a court of law often in writ jurisdiction of the superior
courts but no less in statutory processes wherever the
same are available.
40. It is neither necessary nor proper for us to attempt
an exhaustive enumeration of what would constitute
the fundamental policy of Indian law nor is it possible
to place the expression in the straitjacket of a
definition. What is important in the context of the case
at hand is that if on facts proved before them the
arbitrators fail to draw an inference which ought to
have been drawn or if they have drawn an inference
which is on the face of it, untenable resulting in
miscarriage of justice, the adjudication even when
made by an Arbitral Tribunal that enjoys considerable
latitude and play at the joints in making awards will
be open to challenge and may be cast away or
modified depending upon whether the offending part
is or is not severable from the rest‖.
31. The third juristic principle is that a decision which is
perverse or so irrational that no reasonable person would
have arrived at the same is important and requires some
degree of explanation. It is settled law that where: 1. a
finding is based on no evidence, or 2. an arbitral tribunal
takes into account something irrelevant to the decision
which it arrives at; or 3. ignores vital evidence in arriving at
its decision, such decision would necessarily be perverse.
33. It must clearly be understood that when a court is
applying the ― ―public policy‖ test to an arbitration award,
it does not act as a court of appeal and consequently errors
of fact cannot be corrected. A possible view by the arbitrator
on facts has necessarily to pass muster as the arbitrator is
the ultimate master of the quantity and quality of evidence to
be relied upon when he delivers his arbitral award. Thus an
award based on little evidence or on evidence which does
not measure up in quality to a trained legal mind would not
be held to be invalid on this score1 . Once it is found that the
arbitrators approach is not arbitrary or capricious, then he
is the last word on facts......‖
65.    Therefore, what really flows from above is that first, the learned
arbitrator must have taken a judicial approach; secondly, the principles of
natural justice must have been adhered; thirdly, the decision must not be
perverse.
IV. Whether the impugned arbitral award is liable to be set
aside under 34(2)(a)(ii) of the Arbitration Act on the ground
that there was no privity of contract between the Petitioner and
M/s CL EDUCATE Ltd., as the Employment Agreement was
between the Petitioner and CEITI?
66.    The Petitioner has taken the argument that there was no valid
arbitration agreement between the parties. The Employment Agreement
dated 15th February 2010 containing the arbitration clause was entered
into between the Petitioner and CEITI, Dubai which is a separate and
distinct legal entity from the Respondent and as such, there is no privity
of contract and no arbitration agreement between the Petitioner and the
Respondent herein. Thus, the Arbitral Award is liable to be set aside
under Section 34(2)(a)(ii) of the Act.
67.    This argument of the Petitioner raises the question as to whether
the „Group of Companies‘ doctrine is attracted to the facts and
circumstances of the present case to justify the arbitration proceedings
between M/s CL Educate Ltd. and the Petitioner. This concept was
created specifically by the French courts and International Chamber of
Commerce (ICC) arbitration tribunals. Its goal is to make it possible,
under specific circumstances, for non-signatory members of the same
group of companies to be included in an arbitration agreement that was
originally only signed by one or a small number of those companies.
Pietro Ferrario, The Group of Companies Doctrine in International
Commercial Arbitration: Is There any Reason for this Doctrine to
Exist? (Journal of International Arbitration) while dealing with the
‗Doctrine of Group of Companies‘ in detail has expressed the following
opinion.
In particular, as will be explained in more detail below, for
the application of the group of companies doctrine the
following conditions are necessary:
(a) the intention of all the parties involved to consider
the whole group as the contracting party without
giving importance to which company would conclude
or perform the contract. Thus, arbitration tribunals
will extend the arbitration agreement if they interpret
the parties' will in the sense that the parties meant all
units of the group to be party to the contract without
attaching importance to the form of the contract;
(b) the active participation of the non-signatories in
the negotiation, performance or termination of the
contract, showing the will of those companies to be
party to the contract and, as a consequence, to the
arbitration agreement even though they did not sign it.
Arbitration tribunals and courts give great importance
to this active role of the non-signatories and consider
it fundamental in order to apply the group of
companies doctrine.
As will be shown below in conclusion, the existence of a
group of companies is a factor taken into account by case
law, but it is not the sole ground on which the extension of
the arbitration agreement is based.
68.   In Chloro Controls India Pvt. Ltd. v. Severn Trent Water
Purification Inc. & Ors., (2013) 1 SCC 641, the Hon‟ble Supreme Court
while dealing with Section 45 of the Arbitration Act, held as follows:
―71. Though the scope of an arbitration agreement is limited
to the parties who entered into it and those claiming under
or through them, the courts under the English law have, in
certain cases, also applied the ―group of companies
doctrine‖. This doctrine has developed in the international
context, whereby an arbitration agreement entered into by a
company, being one within a group of companies, can bind
its non signatory affiliates or sister or parent concerns, if
the circumstances demonstrate that the mutual intention of
all the parties was to bind both the signatories and the non-
signatory affiliates. This theory has been applied in a
number of arbitrations so as to justify a tribunal taking
jurisdiction over a party who is not a signatory to the
contract containing the arbitration agreement. [Russell on
72. This evolves the principle that a non-signatory party
could be subjected to arbitration provided these transactions
were with group of companies and there was a clear
intention of the parties to bind both, the signatory as well as
the nonsignatory parties. In other words, ―intention of the
parties‖ is a very significant feature which must be
established before the scope of arbitration can be said to
include the signatory as well as the non-signatory parties.
73. A non-signatory or third party could be subjected to
arbitration without their prior consent, but this would only
be in exceptional cases. The court will examine these
exceptions from the touchstone of direct relationship to the
party signatory to the arbitration agreement, direct
commonality of the subject-matter and the agreement
between the parties being a composite transaction. The
transaction should be of a composite nature where
performance of the mother agreement may not be feasible
without aid, execution and performance of the
supplementary or ancillary agreements, for achieving the
common object and collectively having bearing on the
dispute. Besides all this, the court would have to examine
whether a composite reference of such parties would serve
the ends of justice. Once this exercise is completed and the
court answers the same in the affirmative, the reference of
even non-signatory parties would fall within the exception
afore-discussed.‖
69.    In Cheran Properties Ltd. v. Kasturi & Sons Ltd. & Ors., (2018)
16 SCC 413, a three judge bench of the Hon‟ble Supreme Court
interpreted the Doctrine of Group of Companies in the context of the
enforcement of a domestic arbitration award in the following words:
―23. As the law has evolved, it has recognised that modern
business transactions are often effectuated through multiple
layers and agreements. There may be transactions within a
group of companies. The circumstances in which they have
entered into them may reflect an intention to bind both
signatory and non-signatory entities within the same group.
In holding a non-signatory bound by an arbitration
agreement, the court approaches the matter by attributing to
the transactions a meaning consistent with the business
sense which was intended to be ascribed to them. Therefore,
factors such as the relationship of a non-signatory to a party
which is a signatory to the agreement, the commonality of
subject matter and the composite nature of the transaction
weigh in the balance. The group of companies doctrine is
essentially intended to facilitate the fulfilment of a mutually
held intent between the parties, where the circumstances
indicate that the intent was to bind both signatories and non-
signatories. The effort is to find the true essence of the
business arrangement and to unravel from a layered
structure of commercial arrangements, an intent to bind
someone who is not formally a signatory but has assumed
the obligation to be bound by the actions of a signatory.‖
70.   In MTNL v. Canara Bank & Ors., (2020) 12 SCC 767, the
Hon‟ble Supreme Court held as follows:
―10.3. A non-signatory can be bound by an arbitration
agreement on the basis of the ―group of companies‖
doctrine, where the conduct of the parties evidences a clear
intention of the parties to bind both the signatory as well as
the non signatory parties. Courts and tribunals have
invoked this doctrine to join a non-signatory member of the
group, if they are satisfied that the non-signatory company
was by reference to the common intention of the parties, a
necessary party to the contract.
―10.5. The group of companies doctrine has been invoked by
courts and tribunals in arbitrations, where an arbitration
agreement is entered into by one of the companies in the
group; and the non-signatory affiliate, or sister, or parent
concern, is held to be bound by the arbitration agreement, if
the facts and circumstances of the case demonstrate that it
was the mutual intention of all parties to bind both the
signatories and the non-signatory affiliates in the group. The
doctrine provides that a non-signatory may be bound by an
arbitration agreement where the parent or holding company,
or a member of the group of companies is a signatory to the
arbitration agreement and the non signatory entity on the
group has been engaged in the negotiation or performance
of the commercial contract, or made statements indicating
its intention to be bound by the contract, the non-signatory
will also be bound and benefitted by the relevant contracts. [

10.6. The circumstances in which the ―group of companies‖
doctrine could be invoked to bind the non-signatory affiliate
of a parent company, or inclusion of a third party to an
arbitration, if there is a direct relationship between the party
which is a signatory to the arbitration agreement; direct
commonality of the subject-matter; the composite nature of
the transaction between the parties. A ―composite
transaction‖ refers to a transaction which is interlinked in
nature; or, where the performance of the agreement may not
be feasible without the aid, execution, and performance of
the supplementary or the ancillary agreement, for achieving
the common object, and collectively having a bearing on the
dispute.
10.7. The group of companies doctrine has also been
invoked in cases where there is a tight group structure with
strong organisational and financial links, so as to constitute
a single economic unit, or a single economic reality. In such
a situation, signatory and non-signatories have been bound
together under the arbitration agreement. This will apply in
particular when the funds of one company are used to
financially support or restructure other members of the
group. [ ICC Case No. 4131 of 1982, ICC Case No. 5103 of
71.   Gary B. Born in his treatise on International Commercial
Arbitration indicates that:
“The principal legal basis for holding that a non signatory
is bound (and benefited) by an arbitration agreement …
include both purely consensual theories (e.g., agency,
assumption, assignment) and non-consensual theories (e.g.
estoppel, alter ego).
―Authorities from virtually all jurisdictions hold that a party
who has not assented to a contract containing an arbitration
clause may nonetheless be bound by the clause if that party
is an ‗alter ego‘ of an entity that did execute, or was
otherwise a party to, the agreement. This is a significant, but
exceptional, departure from the fundamental principle …
that each company in a group of companies (a relatively
modern concept) is a separate legal entity possessed of
separate rights and liabilities.
the group of companies doctrine is akin to principles of
agency or implied consent, whereby the corporate
affiliations among distinct legal entities provide the
foundation for concluding that they were intended to be
parties to an agreement, notwithstanding their formal status
as non-signatories.‖
72.    This Court has perused the Employment Agreement which has
been entered into between the Petitioner and the Respondent. This
Agreement itself was executed on the letter-head of Career Launcher
(M/s CL EDUCATE Ltd. was previously known as Career Launcher. In
addition to this, it has been clearly mentioned in the Employment
Agreement itself that CEITI is authorized to run the Career Launcher test-
prep courses in UAE. The legal notice dated 6th November 2013 itself has
been sent on behalf of M/s CL Educate Ltd. to which the Petitioner had
responded.
73.    However, this Court is conscious of the dictum of the Hon‟ble
Supreme Court in Cox and Kings Limited vs. SAP India Pvt. Ltd.,
(2022) 8 SCC 1, wherein a three judge bench of the Hon'ble Supreme
Court had doubted the application of this Doctrine as well as the decision
in Chloro Controls (supra) and hence, referred the matter to a larger
bench for further consideration. It was held as follows:
"36. The interpretation of Chloro Controls was further
expanded in the three-Judge Bench decision of this Court
in Cheran Properties Ltd. v. Kasturi & Sons Ltd. In that
case, this Court interpreted Section 35 of the Arbitration Act
to enforce an award against a non-signatory, even though it
did not participate in the proceedings.
37. This Court in Reckitt Benckiser (India) (P)
Ltd. v. Reynders Label Printing (India) (P) Ltd. [Reckitt
Benckiser (India) (P) Ltd. v. Reynders Label Printing (India)
wherein the two-Judge Bench of this Court refused to apply
the ―Group of Companies‖ doctrine as the applicant failed
to prove the commonality of intention of the respondents to
be bound by the arbitration agreement : (SCC pp. 64 & 74,
―4. Keeping in mind the exposition in Chloro
Controls [Chloro Controls India (P) Ltd. v. Severn Trent
SCC (Civ) 689] … In other words, whether the
indisputable circumstances go to show that the mutual
intention of the parties was to bind both the signatory as
well as the non-signatory parties, namely, Respondent 1
and Respondent 2, respectively, qua the existence of an
arbitration agreement between the applicant and the
said respondents.
12. … Thus, Respondent 2 was neither the signatory
to the arbitration agreement nor did have any causal
connection with the process of negotiations preceding
the agreement or the execution thereof, whatsoever. If
the main plank of the applicant, that Mr Frederik
Reynders was acting for and on behalf of Respondent 2
and had the authority of Respondent 2, collapses, then it
must necessarily follow that Respondent 2 was not a
party to the stated agreement nor had it given assent to
the arbitration agreement and, in absence thereof, even if
Respondent 2 happens to be a constituent of the group of
companies of which Respondent 1 is also a constituent,
that will be of no avail. For, the burden is on the
applicant to establish that Respondent 2 had an
intention to consent to the arbitration agreement and be
party thereto, maybe for the limited purpose of
enforcing the indemnity Clause 9 in the agreement,
which refers to Respondent 1 and the supplier group
against any claim of loss, damages and expenses,
howsoever incurred or suffered by the applicant and
arising out of or in connection with matters specified
therein. That burden has not been discharged by the
applicant at all. On this finding, it must necessarily
follow that Respondent 2 cannot be subjected to the
proposed arbitration proceedings. Considering the
averments in the application under consideration, it is
not necessary for us to enquire into the fact as to which
other constituent of the group of companies, of which the
respondents form a part, had participated in the
negotiation process.‖
38. In the Division Bench decision of this Court
in MTNL v. Canara Bank [MTNL v. Canara Bank, (2020) 12
SCC 767] , it was observed that the group of companies
doctrine can be utilised to bind a third party to an
arbitration, if a tight corporate group structure constituting
a single economic reality existed. The Court held as under :
(SCC pp. 779-80, para 10)
―10.6. The circumstances in which the ―Group of
Companies‖ doctrine could be invoked to bind the non-
signatory affiliate of a parent company, or inclusion of a
third party to an arbitration, if there is a direct
relationship between the party which is a signatory to the
arbitration agreement; direct commonality of the subject-
matter; the composite nature of the transaction between
the parties. A ―composite transaction‖ refers to a
transaction which is interlinked in nature; or, where the
performance of the agreement may not be feasible
without the aid, execution, and performance of the
supplementary or the ancillary agreement, for achieving
the common object, and collectively having a bearing on
the dispute.
10.7. The group of companies doctrine has also been
invoked in cases where there is a tight group structure
with strong organisational and financial links, so as to
constitute a single economic unit, or a single economic
reality. In such a situation, signatory and non-signatories
have been bound together under the arbitration
agreement. This will apply in particular when the funds
of one company are used to financially support or
restructure other members of the group. [ ICC Case No.
4131 of 1982 : (1984) 9 Yearbook of Commercial
Arbitration 131; ICC Case No. 5103 of 1988 : (1991)
39. We may notice that these cases have been decided by
this Court, without referring to the ambit of the phrase
―claiming through or under‖ as occurring under Section 8
of the Arbitration Act.
40. The ratio of the Chloro Controls case [Chloro Controls
India (P) Ltd. v. Severn Trent Water Purification Inc., (2013)
1 SCC 641 : (2013) 1 SCC (Civ) 689] alludes to the
subjective intention of parties to be bound by arbitration
agreement when the parties have clearly not been signatory
to the agreement. Reconciling the two is difficult and
requires exposition by this Court.
41. It may be noted that the doctrine, as expounded, requires
the joining of non-signatories as ―parties in their own
right‖. This joinder is not premised on non-signatories
―claiming through or under‖. Such a joinder has the effect
of obliterating the commercial reality, and the benefits of
keeping subsidiary companies distinct. Concepts like single
economic entity are economic concepts difficult to be
enforced as principles of law.
42. The areas which were left open by this Court in Chloro
Controls case [Chloro Controls India (P) Ltd. v. Severn
SCC (Civ) 689] has created certain broad-based
understanding of this doctrine which may not be suitable and
would clearly go against distinct legal identities of
companies and party autonomy itself. The aforesaid
exposition in the above case clearly indicates an
understanding of the doctrine which cannot be sustainable in
a jurisdiction which respects party autonomy. There is a
clear need for having a re-look at the doctrinal ingredients
concerning the group of companies doctrine.
43. Internationally, the group of companies doctrine has
been accepted in varying degrees. Swiss Courts usually do
not recognise such a doctrine under their Switzerland de
lege lata. [ Award in Geneva Chamber of Commerce Case of
has observed as under:
―… Mr Hoffmann suggested beguilingly that it would be
technical for us to distinguish between parent and subsidiary
company in this context; economically, he said, they were
one. But we are concerned not with economics but with law.
The distinction between the two is, in law, fundamental and
cannot here be bridged.‖ [Bank of Tokyo Ltd. v. Karoon,
1987 AC 45, p. 64 : (1986) 3 WLR 414 (CA)]
51. In view of the aforesaid discussion, we feel it
appropriate to refer the aspect of interpretation of
“claiming through or under” as occurring in amended
Section 8 of the Arbitration Act qua the doctrine of group
of companies to a larger Bench to provide clarity on this
aspect. The law laid down in Chloro Controls case [Chloro
Controls India (P) Ltd. v. Severn Trent Water Purification
Inc., (2013) 1 SCC 641 : (2013) 1 SCC (Civ) 689] and the
cases following it, appear to have been based, more on
economics and convenience rather than law. This may not
be a correct approach. The Bench doubts the correctness of
the law laid down in Chloro Controls case [Chloro
Controls India (P) Ltd. v. Severn Trent Water Purification
Inc., (2013) 1 SCC 641 : (2013) 1 SCC (Civ) 689] and cases
following it.
74.    Accordingly, as a matter of utmost judicial propriety, as the larger
bench of the Hon‟ble Supreme Court is seized of the issue at hand, this
Court is not inclined to render any judicial finding on the issue of
application of the Doctrine of Group of Companies in the facts and
circumstances of the present case. It is also to be noted that findings on
this issue do not tilt the conclusion which is reached in the present case
on the findings already recorded on the other issues.
75.    In view of the discussion aforesaid on facts and law, this Court is
satisfied that there was no effective delivery of arbitral award to the
Petitioner and the present case is fully covered by the decisions of the
Hon‟ble Supreme Court in Tecco Trichy (supra), Benarsi Krishna
(supra) and ARK Builders (supra). Accordingly, the present application
is within the purview of limitation as envisaged under Section 34(3) of
the Arbitration Act. This Court is also satisfied that no mandatory notice
under Section 21 of the Arbitration Act was given to the Petitioner, in
view of the dictum of the Division Bench of this Court in Shriram
Transport (supra). This Court is also satisfied that the Arbitrator has
applied wrong governing law while adjudicating the disputes between the
parties. The entire dispute was to be adjudicated by the substantive law of
the Contract which was the UAE Federal Labour Law in view of the
dictum of the Supreme Court of United Kingdom in Enka Insaat (supra).
The impugned arbitral award is contrary to settled norms of „Fundamental
Policy of Indian Law‟ in view of the dictum of the Hon‟ble Supreme
Court in Associate Builders (supra).
76.    Accordingly, the impugned arbitral award dated 16th March 2015
passed by the learned sole arbitrator, Mr. Divya Darshan Sharma in the
case titled as „CL Educate Ltd. vs. Monika Oli’ is quashed and set aside.
The Petition stands allowed in the above terms.
77.    Pending applications, if any, also stand disposed of.
78.    The judgment be uploaded on the website forthwith.
