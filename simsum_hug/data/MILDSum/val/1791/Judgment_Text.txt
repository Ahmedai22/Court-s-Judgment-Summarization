The instant case evoked a lot of public outrage
and the initial inference of suicide and repeated
requests made by the investigating agencies to close
the case as untraceable, created a frenzy which put
officers, men and institutions on the dock; often in
the extended media trial. A final report was filed
eventually by PW49, the last of the Investigating
Officers   (I.O)    from   the      Central   Bureau   of
Investigation (C.B.I), in July 2009; he having taken
over the investigation on 1.11.2008. The deceased was
a Nun residing in a Convent which also had a Ladies
Hostel.  A1  to  A3  were   arrested  on  18.11.2008  and
contrary to the earlier inferences, a charge under
Section   302   was    levelled.    The   accused   filed
applications for discharge, of which, that filed by
A2 alone was allowed. Challenge was made by both A1,
A3 and a public spirited person, PW24, and the C.B.I;
the last two against A3's discharge; all of which stood
rejected by this Court.
2. A1 and A3 faced trial and was convicted for
offences under Sections 302, 201, r/w 34 & A1 also under
Section 449 IPC. Both the accused were sentenced with
imprisonment for life and fine of Rs.5 lakhs each, for
the offence under Section 302 r/w 34 and seven years
rigorous      imprisonment       with    fine,  each  of  Rs.50,000/-,
under Section 201 r/w 34. The first accused also was
sentenced to life imprisonment and fine of Rs.1,00,000/-
for    the    offence     under    Section     449.  Suitable  default
sentences were also imposed. The appellants have filed
the above applications for suspension of sentence till
the hearing of the appeal.
3. We heard Sri.B.Raman Pillai, learned Senior
Counsel     for    A1,    Sri.P.     Vijaya    Bhanu,  learned  Senior
Counsel for A2 and Sri.P.Sooryakaran Reddi, learned Addl.
Solicitor General for the C.B.I.
4.   According      to   Sri.Raman    Pillai,  the  very
allegation of the prosecution was that A1 to A3 together
committed the crime and when A2 was discharged; the very
foundation of the allegation is put to peril and there
could be no successful prosecution carried out. It is
pointed out that in the earlier investigation, though an
axe    was    recovered       from   the   premises;   allegedly  the
offending weapon, later it was altered as a 'kaikodali'
(transliterated         roughly     as   'hand-axe').   However  both
these     weapons      were    neither    seized  or   recovered  nor
produced before Court, despite the Doctor, who conducted
post-mortem, spoke of a hand-axe having been shown to
him. Obviously the alteration regarding the weapon was
only since the original axe could never have caused the
minor    injuries      found     on  the   deceased.  The  allegation
against     A1   to    A3   of   having   been  found  in  suspicious
circumstances, was later altered to having been found
engaging in sex; so as to incite public condemnation
especially since the accused were persons conferred with
holy orders; a Priest and a Nun. The circumstances listed
out by the learned Sessions Judge were referred and each
of them assailed, vehemently. According to A1, he was not
at all present in the Convent and the disturbance found
in the kitchen does not incriminate him. The presence of
A1   in    the   Convent      was  spoken    by  PW3  who   admittedly
entered the Convent in the wee hours to thieve from the
premises. The inherent weakness of the testimony of a
thief coupled with the discrepancies in the versions, in
the deposition and prior statements, as to how he saw A1
in the Convent and later identified him, were pointed
out. The trial Judge found PW8 to have corroborated PW3,
which     corroboration,        if  at   all   can  only  be   to  the
declared vocation of PW3, a thief, and not at all with
respect      to     his    presence     at    the   Convent   or   the
identification of A1. PW8 was a witness in a number                 of
cases against PW3; judgments in which were produced by
the prosecution across the Bar after the evidence was
closed, clearly indicating his testimony to the contrary.
PW3’s prior statements regarding the person to whom he
sold stolen property was a different person altogether.
5. PW3 also has alternatively spoken of having seen
A1 climbing the stairs with another and only of seeing
them both walk on the terrace of the building with lit
torches. If the evidence of PW3 is believed, that, from
the time he entered the convent at 3.00 a.m. till the
time he left at 5.00 a.m, A1 and another was in the
terrace of the building; the crime definitely could not
have     happened       as    alleged   by    the   prosecution.   The
identification made is from the terrace of a five storied
building,       while      the    witness   was    standing    in  the
neighbouring compound separated by a wall. Specifically
D1 to D5 contradictions were pointed out and it is also
argued that no period was mentioned in which the third
incident of theft in the Convent, by PW3, had occurred.
PW3    admitted     to   have    stolen   two   Water  Metres   on his
leaving the Convent on the crucial day, both of which
were not recovered. CWs 105 and 106 were arrayed in the
final report as house owners from whose compound the
Water Metres were thieved, both of whom were not examined
before     Court.     The    admission   of   A1,   which  is  another
circumstance found against him, is allegedly made to PW6,
a known vexatious litigant and trouble maker; to whom
such statements would never have been made by A1, who had
no prior acquaintance with him. PW6 also prevaricates on
the time when such confession was made; which even if
made,     reveals      only    an   illicit    relationship   and  not
involvement       in    the    crime   of murder.   The  subsequent
conduct, another circumstance, is spoken of by PW24 who
had been heading an Action Council against the so called
lackadaisical investigation and who was almost in the
role of a Prosecutor in the case. The medical evidence by
the experts was in contra distinction with each other and
vary considerably from the findings of the post-mortem
6. Learned Senior Counsel Sri.Vijaya Bhanu takes
us through the specific grounds in the application for
suspension of sentence at paragraph No. 4. It is argued
that there is no evidence at all to show that A1 and A2
had been together on the crucial night or met each other
or carried out any activity together or inflicted the
wounds found on the deceased or dumped the body of the
deceased into the well. The Court merely presumes on
unreliable testimonies that A1 and A3 had been in an
illicit relationship and while engaged in it, was chanced
upon by the deceased, leading to the murder; to silence
the    deceased.       It   is   vehemently  argued   that  A3  was
medically found to be a virgin and the court presumed
that she had carried out medical intervention to escape
detection;       without      any   evidence   on  that  count.  The
admission of A3 said to have been made to PW19 is vague
and not incriminating A3 in the crime. The post-mortem
report, Ext.P6, clearly indicates death by drowning which
was    attempted      to    be   deviated   from  by  PW23,  in  the
laboured      questioning        in   chief  examination.   The  six
injuries noted by PW3 were simple and minor injuries
which were sought to be mooted as possibly fatal injuries
caused by a weapon; the details of which are spelt out
from imagination. PW31 another expert examined is not at
all believable and his deposition was to the effect that
the death was due to the combined effect of drowning and
injuries on the head; quite contrary to the post-mortem
findings and a communication authored by him, confronted
to him in Court. A3 was normally residing in the room and
her presence outside the room was not seen by anyone. It
was pointed out that the learned trial Judge has given a
free     play    of    his     smattering   knowledge   in  physics,
psychology and medicine to rubbish the expert testimony
and that of the other inmates of the Convent, throwing to
the winds all principles of criminal jurisprudence, while
carving      out     a    unique jurisprudential thought not
sanctioned by extant laws.
7. The learned ASG commenced his arguments with the
submission that there is no direct evidence and the case
is based only on circumstantial evidence. It has been
established that A1 had an amorous relationship with A3;
quite in opposition to the vows of the holy order both of
them took, and clandestinely carried it on. A1’s visits
to the Convent in the day light has been spoken of by the
inmates and his visits at night to the Ladies Hostel was
obviously to carry on the illicit relationship with A3.
His presence in the Convent on the subject night has been
spoken of by PW3, as corroborated by CW8. The evidence of
PW3, 6 and 8 having established the illicit relationship
and the presence of A1 at a very odd hour, that too in a
Ladies Hostel, necessarily requires a valid explanation
which does not come forth from A1. The disturbances found
in the kitchen as noticed by the Cook in the morning,
could not have escaped the notice of A3, who was in the
adjacent room. A3 had purposefully chosen the room in the
cellar, to carry on her amorous activities especially
when even the maids were accommodated in the first floor.
The slippers and the veil worn by nuns, found in the
kitchen at the Cellar floor of the building belongs to
the    deceased.      The   death    by   homicide   is  found  by  the
learned trial Judge, after considering expert opinion and
the post-mortem report. PW31 is an expert of exceptional
credentials who was relied on by the Sessions Judge;
rightly so. The ante-mortem injuries were noticed and so
were the injuries on the head which were caused by a hand
axe. The trial judge having meticulously gone through the
evidence       relied      on     the     deposition    of   PW7,   the
Photographer, who spoke of nail marks on the neck of the
victim;     indicating       external     pressure  being   applied  on
her, which rules out suicide. Each of the circumstances
were    elaborately       discussed      by  the  Sessions   Judge  and
there     is    no    reason     to   even    prima   facie   find  the
conviction to be based on no evidence, especially at this
stage. There is no ground for suspending the sentence,
concludes the learned ASG, who canvasses the continued
incarceration        of   the    accused     convicted   of  a  ghastly
crime, violating the conscience of any civilised society;
committed only to hide their carnal escapades which also
violate the vows of chastity taken by them.
8. As we noticed at the outset, the instant case
was    in    the    public     eye  for    long   and    there  was   no
resolution to the cause underlying the sad death of a
young nun, which purportedly was achieved by the impugned
conviction.       But that shall not deter us from considering
the evidence led by the Prosecution as to the culpability
of the two accused who stood trial. We are undaunted by
the    fact    that    the   accused    are   ordained    members  of  a
Church     nor     intimidated     by    the   outrage    displayed   in
public. We also remind ourselves that we are only on a
prima facie consideration of whether the accused, from
the evidence led, can be found to have committed the
crime, beyond all reasonable doubt. The Sessions Judge
has first listed out the issues, which at serial number
one     deals     with    the    various     aspects    leading   to   a
conclusion      of    homicide    and   at   serial   numbers   2  to  5
regarding the culpability of the accused of the actual
crime of murder. We would consider the aspects in the
reverse     order;     first     the  circumstances  which form  an
unbroken chain linking the accused and then as to the
causation of death.
9. The circumstances as listed out by the learned
Session     Judge     were    ten    in  number: (i)   the abnormal
disturbances in the kitchen, work & wash area found on
the morning of 27.3.1992, (ii) solitary presence of A3 in
the cellar of the Convent on the night of 27.3.1992; both
spoken of by PW11, (iii) the presence of A1 deposed by
PW3 and corroborated by PW8 (iv) admission of A1 to PW6
about an illicit relationship with A3, (v) admission of
A3 to PWs 19&29 Doctors about her amorous relationship,
(vi) subsequent conduct of A3 of medical intervention to
cover up her loss of virginity, (vii) failure of the
accused to explain the incriminating circumstances, (ix)
the bizarre version put forth by the accused regarding
the cause of death alleging it to be a suicide and (x)
destruction of vital evidence.
10. The first two circumstances are spoken of by
PW11, an employee in the kitchen of the Convent. PW11 was
the first one to come to the kitchen area on the morning
of 27.3.1992, who had closed the doors from the work area
to the outside, before retiring on the previous night.
She had gone with the deceased to a Bible Convention on
the previous day and returned at about 8.30 p.m after
which they went about their individual affairs in the
Convent; the deceased being an inmate-student and the
witness, a maid. PW11 is said to have got up about 5 a.m.
in   the    morning     and    on  reaching   the  kitchen,   saw  the
lights on, which she had put off on the previous night.
She also saw the exit door from the work area, which she
closed from the inside, open in the morning with a head
gear worn by nuns, hooked on the door. Two slippers were
also found near the fridge and wash basin. She asked her
co-employee       to   call     Sister   Stephy  (A3)   and  when  the
Mother came; obviously the head of the Convent, she was
told    that     the    headgear     and   slippers   belong   to  the
deceased. Despite the witness being declared hostile, the
Court     relied     on   her    testimony;   rightly    so.  But  the
disturbances        were     the   slippers    and  veil    found,  in
addition to the 'kaikodali' seen only by PW4, the Sub
Inspector who reached the crime scene a little later. The
presence of the weapon, not spoken of by PW11, will be
dealt with later. The so called disturbances found in the
kitchen by PW11, being the abandoned slippers and veil of
the deceased, do not incriminate anyone, especially when
the deceased was missing and later found dead in the
11. Admittedly an inmate of the convent had died on
the previous night and her body was recovered from the
well. According to PW11, she               was with the deceased on
the previous day and they parted company only at night
after     they    returned       from   the  Bible  Convention.  The
testimony      of    PW11     definitely    does  not  lead  to  any
inference of the deceased having nurtured any suicidal
thoughts nor does it warrant an inference of murder; by
itself. As far as the solitary presence of A3 in the
Cellar, it is deposed by PW11 that, one Sister Helen who
was the roommate of A3, was not available for 4 to 5
days. It cannot for a moment be assumed that A3 chose the
Cellar room to carry on her amorous jaunts since she had
a regular room-mate staying there, who was temporarily
absent.      Even     the    trial    Court   does   not  find  this
circumstance to be engineered and prima facie we are of
the opinion that the above stated circumstances cannot be
considered as incriminating A3 and definitely not A1.
12. The next circumstance is the sighting of A1, by
PW3    at   the    Convent.      According  to  PW3,  who  declared
himself to be a petty thief, he had entered the convent
thrice in the night with the intention of theft. He used
to   pluck     coconuts     from   the  neighboring  property  from
where he saw the copper plates on the lightning arrester.
He   used    to    climb    the   cocoa  tree  in  the  neighboring
property, to scale the wall of the Convent and steal the
copper plates. He also deposed that he used to sell the
stolen plates to a Muslim, whose name he was not aware
of. It was deposed in chief examination that, on the
third occasion, when he reached the cocoa tree, he saw
two persons, males, coming to the staircase with torch
lights who were identified as A1 and A2.               According to
him, he had also seen A1 near the Convent on the next
morning while he was proceeding to sell the water meters
stolen on the previous day. He immediately testifies that
he   saw    the    commotion      near  the  Convent  when  he  was
returning after selling the stolen water meters. Anyway,
next morning seeing a commotion near the Convent, he made
inquiries and was told that a nun is found dead, in the
well, where he also saw A1.
13. Ext.D1 contradiction marked form PW3's Section
161    statement      reads    as  the    witness  having  found  two
persons     standing      on   the  terrace,    watching  the  nearby
areas with the aid of torch light, which PW3 denied in
cross examination. According to PW3, he reached the cocoa
tree between 3.30 and 4 a.m, contrary to his S. 164
statement that it was between 2 and 2.30 a.m (Ext. D4).
He admitted in cross that he remained there till 5 a.m
when the siren sounded. PW3 also spoke of not having
carried     out    any   theft    for    reason of  having  seen  two
persons in the terrace, but spoke of taking two water
meters and selling them on the same day. There is no
recovery made of the said water meters, which could have
corroborated the version of PW3 and also pinpointed the
site from which such water meters were thieved.                  More
pertinently the deceased was seen alive at 4.15 a.m. and
PW11 was woken up at 5 a.m. PW11 also came down to the
Cellar, where she detected the ‘disturbances’. PW3 says
he   was    in    the    neighboring    property   till   5.00   a.m.,
watching the two persons on the terrace of the building.
If true, PW3 definitely would have witnessed a part of
the alleged crime.
14. The deposition that PW3 had sold the water meters
assumes relevance especially in the circumstance of the
trial court having relied heavily on the testimony of PW8
for corroboration of the evidence of PW3.                 PW8 in his
deposition      stated     that  he   used  to   regularly   purchase
things from PW3 and that PW3 was familiar with him as
also     his    family     members.    However,   PW3   in   his   161
statement feigned ignorance of the name of the person to
whom he sells the stolen articles. In the 164 statement
to the Magistrate, PW3 named his regular fence as one
Ashraf and PW8 deposed that PW3 used to bring articles to
his uncle Ashraf. One other interesting aspect is the
various judgments produced by the prosecution across the
Bar,    before     the    trial  Court,   after   the   evidence   was
closed. These are judgments in which PW3 was accused of
theft and in all of them he stood acquitted. PW8 was a
witness      in    the    said   cases   where   he   feigned    total
ignorance       of   PW3    and  denied   having   purchased    stolen
articles from PW3. PW8's evidence was relied on, coupled
with the allegations of custodial torture of PW3, to find
manipulations         by     a   Police    Officer;    which    cannot
incriminate the accused.
15. PW3 also spoke of having seen A1 in torch light
on    the    previous      night;   with   whom  he   had   no   prior
acquaintance.        He says he also recognized the said person
from a crowd near the convent on the next day morning. He
saw A1, as per the prior statement, in pitch dark from
near the cocoa tree of the neighboring property; while A1
was in the terrace of the five-storied building of the
Convent.       PW3    in     Court,   said   he   saw   two    persons
approaching the staircase of the Convent, from the next
property separated by a wall. Both these versions are
highly     improbable      and   in  any   case  not   sufficient   to
enable a valid identification, inter alia, as there is no
source of light spoken of. The Section 161 statement from
which     the    contradictions       were   marked   was   taken   on
11.07.2007, 15 years after the alleged crime and there is
no TIP conducted to identify A1 who was arrested much
later     on    18.11.2008.      The    first    identification   of   a
person, whom PW11 saw in the year 1992, was made at the
time    when    he   deposed     before    Court   in  the  year  2019,
making it a very weak piece of evidence.
16. The fourth circumstance relied on by the trial
court is the testimony of PW6.              PW6 claims to be a social
worker; who the defense allege is a vexatious litigant.
According to him, he had contacted A1 when there was a
report in the media that the accused in this case were
being subjected to Narco analysis test. He contacted the
Bishop's house at Kottayam and obtained an appointment
with    A1.    According      to   PW6,    A1  was   with  A2  and   the
conversation        was    with   respect     to   Narco   analysis.   A
leading question was put to him as to the physical and
mental status of A1 at the time of interview and PW6
responded      that    A1   was   apprehending      something  and   was
aghast with fear. When PW6 tried to calm A1, he caught
hold of his cassock and told the witness with anguish
that he was also a human being inside the dress and he
was    not   made    of    stone   or    iron.   He  is  said  to  have
confessed that he committed a mistake and he was living
with Stephy as husband and wife. He also implored that he
alone was being crucified while everyone was indulging in
such    activities.       This    is  styled  as  an  extra-judicial
confession; quite strange since the crime alleged is of
murder and not lewd immorality. When the witness mounted
the box on the next day for cross examination, without
any prompting, he volunteered that the interview with A1,
he spoke of in his chief examination, occurred after the
Narco analysis. We cannot but notice that A1 is not being
tried for the illicit relationship with a woman, even a
nun    and    if   at    all    it   is  established,  it  does  not
establish his involvement in the crime, unless there are
other cogent circumstances. Pertinent also is the fact
that     PW6 did not say the name of A3 as having divulged
to him by A1, in the Section 161-statement. Together with
this, we have to look at the sixth circumstance of the
subsequent conduct of A1 as spoken of by PW24. PW24 was
heading the action council for justice to the family of
the deceased.         According to him, A1 threatened him with
dire consequences if he continues challenging the Church,
specifically with the instant case. In fact, PW24 has a
contention that his own brother was incensed with his
actions      against       the   Church    and   had   attacked    him
physically. The threat of A1, if at all levelled against
PW24, does not establish his involvement in the crime
since     the    acts    spoken   of    by  PW24,  could   have   been
motivated on the assumption that PW24 was attempting to
tarnish the image of the Church.
17. Next, we come to the admission of A3 to PW19
and PW29. The history given by A3; who voluntarily agreed
to    a    medical      examination,      admitted   herself    having
indulged in sex and having been twice subjected to per
vaginal examination. She admitted having indulged herself
with a relative, without actual penetration. The trial
Judge having first found no inference possible to the
fact     in    issue,     later    draws    a  conclusion    to   A3's
predilection to sexual activities though it offers little
connection to her relationship with A1. We cannot but
observe that the conclusion is strained for A3 is not on
trial for her loose morals or character flaws. PW19, the
Doctor who examined A3 deposed that her hymen was not
torn     and    that    there      could   be   no   definite   opinion
regarding A3 having had a sexual intercourse. Admittedly
there were interpolations made by PW29 in the medical
report     marked      as    Ext.P79;     which   was   sought   to  be
explained away as having been made after consultation
with PW19. We would have expected the two Doctors, who
were constituted as a team, for the examination of A3, to
have     carried      out    a    joint    examination    and   made  a
comprehensive report of the findings, both, agreed upon
and differed from. The glaring interpolations cannot be
shrouded      in    high     sounding     words   of   the   'intrinsic
incompatibility within the semantic outcome of holistic
frame work of the report' not having been brought out.
When the relationship with A1 was not established, and
there     is   no    concrete      evidence   regarding    any  medical
intervention done on A3, it cannot be assumed that PW19’s
opinion on examination was only because of a medical
intervention        carried      out,   to   cover   up  the   loss  of
virginity. The opinion also was that there is possibly a
surgical intervention to repair the torn hymen, since the
examination revealed it to be scarred. The opinion is not
definite and the probable inference again is a breach of
the    chastity     vows,     which   again   do   not  establish   the
relationship       with    A1    or the    alleged   escapade   on  the
crucial night        or more critically connect A3 with the
crime of murder.
18. On the medical evidence, we need not enter
any finding since at this stage we are not examining the
evidence led, in totality, as would be done in the case
of a hearing in appeal. But we look at the same only for
completeness and both the defence and the prosecution
have addressed arguments on the same. We have to first
reckon     the    postmortem      certificate,     Ext.P62,   then  the
evidence of PW33, the Doctor who conducted postmortem and
PW31, the celebrity expert witness.              The clear opinion as
to    the    cause     of   death    available    in   the  postmortem
certificate       is   that    'the   deceased    died  of  drowning'.
Searching       examination       was    made  of    the   Doctor,   in
chief-examination, to enter upon on an opinion as to how
the     ante    mortem      injuries     could   have    been   caused.
Eventually the Doctor deposed that the possibility of
injuries numbered as 1, 2 & 6 being                 caused by assault
with a hard and blunt object cannot be ruled out. As for
injury      number      6    it    was    opined   that   it   caused
subarachanoid        hemorrhage      of  the   brain,  by  which  the
victim could be rendered unconscious or semi-conscious.
The Doctor opined in consonance with Ext. P62 that the
person would have died due to antemortem drowning but the
injuries could also have 'added' (sic)-(aided?) the cause
of death.
19. Quite interestingly the Doctor deposed that a
weapon     was    produced     by   the  I.O   which  looked  like  a
'kaikodali', opined to have possibly caused the injuries
on the head, by using its wooden handle. In fact, no hand
axe (kaikodali) was seized by the Police or produced
before Court. As argued by the learned Senior Counsel for
the defense, there was an axe recovered in the earlier
investigation which again was not produced before Court.
The learned ASG would point out that PW1, the maid in the
Convent had spoken of a hand-axe.               We again went to the
deposition of PW11 and find her categorical statement to
be that 'there was no hand-axe' and 'there was an axe
lying     on    the    side     of   the   kitchen'.   Obviously  the
testimony is not to the effect that a hand-axe, available
in the kitchen was missing; but that there was NO hand-
axe    in   the   premises.      When    a weapon  is  shown  to  the
Doctor, as possible of being used to commit the crime, we
should     assume     that    it  was    seized  from  the  scene  of
occurrence or recovered on the same being pointed out by
the accused or otherwise; both of which circumstance is
not available in this case. It would have sufficed to
note the injuries having been caused by a hard object or
weapon; which is often the case in which no offending
weapon is seized or recovered. PW49 the I.O, also speaks
of the allegation in the remand report, initially made,
of the deceased having been hit on the back of the head
with     an    axe.     In    the   next    remand  application   the
description was altered to a hand axe. He does not offer
any explanation with regard to the hand-axe shown to the
Doctor as deposed by the Doctor.
20. Credible sustenance to the theory of ante-
mortem injuries having been caused by the accused, before
the body was dumped into the well, is garnered by the ASG
from PW31. PW31 is another expert who ruled out suicide
and opined that injuries 1, 2 & 6 could be caused by the
butt of a small axe, the first two being lacerated wounds
and the last a contusion; which together were capable of
causing     death.     He   also   opined  that  the  death  in   the
instant case was caused by a combination of drowning an
injuries. In cross examination he was confronted with
Ext.D23     communication        authored  by  him,  which  we   have
perused. After perusing the postmortem report issued by
PW33, the letter from one Dr. G.R Bhasker; both received
from Dr.B.Umadathan, PW31 has detailed his observations
in seven pages and given his opinion in the last page.
His opinion was that the postmortem appearances are quite
consistent with drowning, the injuries noted on the body
minor, and not sufficient or even likely to cause death;
which could also be caused in the course of a fall into
the well. Injuries Nos.1, 2 & 6 could alternatively be
caused in the process of location and retrieval of the
body. It was also opined that the medical findings make
it    difficult      to    definitely    categorize  the   death   as
accidental, suicidal or homicidal. He admitted that it
was his opinion, but that he was fooled, admitting the
authorship. On his being queried about his opinion in the
admitted document that the injuries 1, 2 & 6 did not
result     in    a   skull     injury    or  increased    intracranial
tension and that those were not major injuries, which
could cause coma or death; he answered that it was a one
sided opinion, without any truth in it. According to the
said document, admittedly authored by the witness, the
conclusion      after     perusing    the   documents   of  the  above
case, was that the evidence on record shows that it is a
case of typical well drowning. However he responded that
he   had    made    the    observation     only  to   help  a  lawyer,
cutting at the root of his credibility. He proclaimed
vehemently that his tongue would not lie, specifically
gesturing to that appendage, but again explained it to be
a   one-sided      opinion     made   by   him,  which   leads  to  an
inference that his pen may give one-sided opinions; that
too, not necessarily truthful. We find no reason to place
any reliance on his evidence.
21.    The   nail    marks   seen   on  the  neck  by  the
photographer, PW7 is another aspect heavily relied on by
the trial Court; which even the Doctor who conducted
post-mortem failed to notice or report. The trial Court
laboured on the absence of the negatives, to find it
inconsequential,          without   realizing   that   even  the
photographs were not produced. The photographs produced
as Ext. P27, are said to be that of the Convent, by the
defence; not controverted by the learned ASG, who was
assisted by the I.O, before this Court. We also have
summoned the photographs, which were send by the trial
Court on the Whatsapp through the Registrar General of
this Court, which on perusal indicates those to be merely
of the Convent and not of the body. PW7 hence had not
produced      any   photographs   of  the  body  and it  was his
unsubstantiated deposition that was relied on in contrast
to the testimony of the Doctor based on the post-mortem
report. The trial judge for the said purpose found the
perception of a photographer to be more precise than that
of a pathologist; which we cannot countenance.
22.      We do not dwell on the circumstance of lack of
explanation or the bizarre ones, of suicide given by the
accused since that can only form a link in the chain of
circumstances and cannot solely lead to a conviction. On
a prima facie look at the evidence as pointed out by the
defense,       and      not      effectively       countered    by   the
prosecution, we cannot but release the two accused, as an
interim      measure,      suspending       their   sentence   till  the
disposal of the appeal. The accused shall be released on
the following conditions.
(i) The petitioners/ accused shall be released on
bail     on    execution      of    a   bond   for  Rs.5,00,000/-
(Rupees      five    lakhs     only)    each   with   two  solvent
sureties,        each     for     the    like    amount   to   the
satisfaction of the trial court;
(ii)        If    the    conviction      and    sentence   of  the
petitioners/appellants is upheld or even modified,
the time during which they are so released shall be
excluded in computing the term of their sentence as
provided in Section 389(4) Cr.PC.
(iii)       They shall not indulge in any other crime.
(iv)        For the first six months after release, the
petitioners shall report before the S.H.O concerned
on every Saturday at 11 a.m. and thereafter on every
(v) The petitioners shall not leave the State,
other than with the permission of this Court.
