1.      This writ petition has been filed on behalf of the petitioner under
Article 226 read with Article 227 of the Constitution of India, seeking
transfer of investigation of FIR No.531/2020 dated 05.12.2020 from Police
Station: Karol Bagh, Delhi to C.B.I., New Delhi.
2.      At      the  outset,    it  may     be     observed    that       a    similar
W.P. (CRL.) No.601/2022 with identical prayer was dismissed as withdrawn
vide order dated 22.03.2022.
3.      In brief, the case of the petitioner is that on 16.01.2019, he purchased
a pair of shoes from Woodland. Since the shoes were found to be defective,
an online complaint was made. After lot of communications, the pair of
shoes was taken back for repairs.          The petitioner did not receive any

response from the shoe company and, as such, a complaint was filed before
the SHO, Police Station: Karol Bagh, New Delhi but FIR was not registered.
4.      Subsequently, in 2019, the petitioner made a complaint to the DCP but
there was no response. Further, he filed an application under Section 156(3)
of Cr.P.C., which was dismissed by Ld.M.M. Thereafter, in compliance of
the order passed by Ld.A.S.J. in 2020, FIR No.531/2020 under Sections
406/34 of I.P.C. was registered at Police Station: Karol Bagh on 05.12.2020.
5.      Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that since there was
inordinate delay in investigation and recovery has not been effected, the
prayer has been made for investigation by CBI. He further submits that there
has been violation of Article 21 of the Constitution.
6.      It has been vehemently submitted by the learned APP for the State that
since the petition had been earlier withdrawn, it acts as a res judicata and the
present petition is not maintainable, claiming the same relief before this
Court. It is also contended that there is absolutely no fresh cause of action
and filing of the present petition is merely an abuse of the process of the
court.
It is also pointed out that the chargesheet upon investigation shall be
filed in accordance with law and at this stage, for such a petty matter, it
cannot be judicially envisaged to refer the matter to CBI as prayed by the
petitioner.
Reliance is also placed on (2010) 3 SCC 571 titled as ‘State of West
Bengal and Others v. Committee for Protection of Democratic Rights, West
Bengal and Others’, wherein it has been observed that the extra-ordinary
power under Article 32, 226 of the Constitution of India must be exercised
Digitally Signed       W.P.(CRL) 752/2022                                                       Page 2 of 4
sparingly, cautiously and in exceptional situations where it becomes
necessary to provide credibility to and instill confidence in investigation or
where the incident may have national and international interest ramifications
or where such an order may be necessary for doing complete justice and
enforcing the fundamental rights, on being satisfied that the material
discloses a prima facie case calling for investigation by CBI.
7.      Unfortunately, a writ petition has been again filed by the petitioner on
similar grounds seeking the same relief despite withdrawal of earlier writ
petition, which this Court was inclined to dismiss.
After hearing the parties, I am of the considered view that filing of the
present writ petition seeking the same relief of investigation by CBI may or
may not amount to res judicata but re-agitation of the same issue is nothing
but a gross abuse of the process of the court as there is no change of
circumstances after withdrawal of earlier writ petition. The petitioner, who
himself claims to be an Advocate having a practice of 31 years, has resorted
to re-filing of the petition despite withdrawal of earlier writ petition for a
petty dispute which is being investigated by the State in accordance with
Learned counsel for the petitioner appears to be unaware even of the
situations in which the extra-ordinary power must be exercised for
investigation by CBI.
This Court even on the earlier occasion, while permitting the
withdrawal of the writ petition desisted from imposing the costs. However,
without any change of circumstances, the resort by the petitioner for re-filing
the present writ petition is nothing but a gross abuse of the process of the

court. The court in such circumstances has a power to stop such proceedings
summarily and prevent the time of public and court from being wasted.
In the facts and circumstances, the petition is accordingly dismissed
with a cost of Rs.10,000/- (Rupees Ten Thousand Only) to be deposited by
the petitioner with the Delhi High Court Legal Services Committee within a
period of two weeks.
