The Writ Petition has been filed to direct the respondent-
State of Tamil Nadu to register a case under Section 302 of IPC against
the respondent No.6 and all other police personnel responsible for the
death of the petitioner's son Nithya @ Nithyaraj and to hand over the
investigation of the case in Cr.No.2 of 2017 on the file of the respondent
No.8, to the Central Bureau of Investigation and further directing the
respondent – State to award appropriate compensation to the petitioner
for the death of her son.
2.   The learned counsel appearing for the petitioner submitted
that the son of the petitioner was a member of 'Friends of Police' attached
to K2, Ayanavaram Police Station, Chennai. While being so, on
11.01.2012 the police personnel of K7 ICF Police Station had taken the
petitioner's son (herein after called as “the deceased”) to the police
station. Next day i.e., on 12.01.2012, when the petitioner went to the
police station and enquired about him but she was not allowed to see her
son. The deceased was kept under police custody from 11.01.2012 to
14.01.2012 and he was produced before the learned Magistrate on
14.01.2012, in pursuant to the FIR registered in Crime No.24 of 2012 for
the offences under Sections 420 & 395 of IPC.
2.1. When the deceased was produced before the learned
Magistrate, the petitioner and her relatives had seen him and he was
sustained injuries all over his body. He was also threatened by the sixth
respondent herein that not to disclose anybody about the torture given by
the police personnel in the police station. Unfortunately, the learned
Magistrate also without even verifying the injuries sustained by the
deceased, ordered to remand him. The memo of arrest shows that the
deceased was arrested on 13.01.2012 and he was produced for remand
on 14.01.2012. Accordingly, he was remanded by the learned Magistrate
till 28.01.2012.
2.2. In fact, immediately the deceased informed that he suffered
pain and therefore he was taken to jail hospital and thereafter he was
referred to the Government Royapettah Hospital. He was not given proper
treatment and again he was sent to prison hospital. Due to bad condition
of the deceased, again he was taken to the Government Royapettah
Hospital, Chennai on 16.01.2012. Unfortunately, he died on the way to
hospital on 16.01.2012 itself. On the death of the deceased, FIR has been
registered in Crime No.112 of 2012 under Section 176 of Cr.P.C., on the
file of the Inspector of Police, M3 Puzhal Police Station.
2.3. Thereafter, the learned V Metropolitan Magistrate, Chennai,
conducted inquest on the dead body and found that the deceased died in
suspicious manner. Therefore, the Government of Tamil Nadu passed an
order transferring the investigation from the file of the Inspector of Police,
M3 Puzhal Police Station to the eighth respondent herein. Thereafter, the
eighth respondent registered a case in Crime No.2 of 2017 under Section
176 of Cr.P.C. Further the eighth respondent also kept the FIR without
investigating the same.
2.4. Therefore, the petitioner who is being the mother of the
deceased has filed this Writ Petition for direction directing the State of
Tamil Nadu to award interim compensation and also sought for alteration
of offence into Section 302 of IPC by transferring the investigation to
Central Bureau of Investigation. He further submitted that both custodial
torture and custodial death are gross violation of one's fundamental rights
under Article 21 of the Constitution of India. Therefore, the dependents
of the deceased are entitled for compensation. Therefore he prayed for
necessary directions from this Court.
3.   The learned Government Advocate (Crl. Side) appearing for
the respondent police filed status report and submitted one Dinesh lodged
complaint that on 12.01.2012, while he was talking with her lover, the
deceased came there and threatened them and snatched the cell phone.
On that complaint, the six respondent registered a case in Crime No.24 of
2012 and searched for the deceased. Further on seeing the witnesses, the
deceased ran away and he scaled over a compound wall and jumped and
fell down in which he sustained injuries. With those injuries the deceased
escaped from the spot and took treatment in a hospital at Ayanavaram
and thereafter the complainant and his family members had brought him
to K7 ICF Police Station.
3.1. He further submitted that the head injury mentioned in the
post mortem certificate could be accidental and it could be caused due to
the impact of head over the blunt surface or object during fall or impact
of any blunted object over the right part of the head. The deceased was
remanded to judicial custody and brought to Central Prison, Puzhal on
14.01.2012. Since, he expressed heavy pain in his shoulders, the prison
hospital doctor refused to admit him and referred to Government
Royapettah Hospital, Chennai. Thereafter he was suspected nerve injury
and referred to take CT scan at Rajiv Gandhi Government General
3.2. On 15.01.2012, the deceased was admitted in Rajiv Gandhi
Government Hospital and CT Brain scan was taken. The Neuro Surgeon
opinion was obtained and it reveals that no abnormality detected and nil
active intervention needed. Therefore, he was discharged from the Rajiv
Gandhi Government Hospital and referred to Government Royapettah
Hospital, Chennai for further treatment. Again he was referred for taking
MRI spine scan on 15.01.2012 at 19.55 hours and thereafter, he was
admitted in the prison hospital about 21.10 hours. On 16.01.2012, the
deceased had difficulty in breathing and found it was abnormal and
therefore he was referred to Government Royapettah Hospital at 13.30
hours. It has been reported from the Government Royapettah Hospital at
2.30 p.m., that he was brought dead.
3.3. The learned Government Advocate further submitted that
post mortem was conducted and opined as the injuries in Sl.Nos.1-a to u
and 2 to 9 were found over the deceased body and injuries No.2 & 9
could be accidental. Injuries 1-d,e,t,g,i,j,k,m,n,o,p,r,s,t and u , 3 to 8
could be accidental or could have been inflicted by others. The injury
No.9 is sufficient to cause death in the ordinary course of nature and all
other injuries are not sufficient to cause death in the ordinary course of
nature. Hence it revealed that the death caused due to injury No.9.
3.4. The team of post mortem Doctors opined that the injury
Nos.2 & 9 might have occurred accidentally and opined that the above all
injuries were antemortem in nature occurred 3 to 4 days prior to death.
Since the head injury could be accidental, request was made to get second
opinion from the Director, Directorate of Medical Examination, Kilpauk,
chennai. By the second opinion dated 09.03.2022, it was opined that the
death caused due to thin film of red, subdural hemorrhage patchy areas of
diffuse subarachnoid hemorrhage over both cerebral and both cerebellar
hemispheres of the brain. This could be caused due to impact of head
over the blunt surface or any other object during fall or impact of any
blunted object over the right part of the head.
3.5. On perusal of all the documents and the enquiry conducted
from the doctors and police personnel, the offence has been altered from
Section 176 of Cr.P.C., to Sections 342, 343, 348, 324 & 304(ii) of IPC
on 15.07.2022. Accordingly, alteration report was filed before the learned
Judicial Magistrate-I, Tiruvallur, along with statements and the same is
pending. Hence, he prayed for dismissal of this petition.
4. Heard Mr.P.Pugalenthi, learned counsel appearing for the
petitioner and Mr.A.Gopinath, learned Government Advocate (Crl.Side)
appearing for the respondents 1 to 6 and 8.
5. The petitioner's son was arrested on 13.01.2012 in pursuant
to the Crime No.24 of 2012 registered for the offences under Section 420
r/w 392 of IPC. The said case was registered on receipt of the complaint
from one Dinesh, alleging that on 13.01.2012, the said Dinesh and his
lover were threatened by the deceased by stating that he is the member of
“friend of police” and snatched his cell phone. Immediately, within 24
hours, the deceased was produced before the learned Magistrate for his
remand.
6. In fact, before the learned Magistrate no complaint was
made by the deceased and no injury was found on him. Further in the
prison, he informed about his shoulder pain. Therefore, immediately he
was taken to jail hospital and make an entry in the prison records.
However, the Doctor refused to admit him inside the prison and referred
the deceased to the Government Royapettah Hospital for orthopedic
opinion. Thereafter he was admitted by the ICF police personal in the
Government Royapettah Hospital, Chennai. After examination, the
Orthopedic Surgeon suspected nerve injury and referred the deceased for
CT-brain scan at Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital, Chennai.
7. The Neuro Surgeon opined that no abnormality detected, nil
active intervention needed. Therefore, the deceased was discharged from
the hospital and referred to Government Royapettah Hospital for further
treatment. In fact on 15.01.2012, again the deceased was taken to MRI
scan on his spine. Thereafter he was again taken to prison and admitted
in the prison hospital. On 16.01.2012, he had difficulty in breathing and
therefore, again he was referred to the Government Royapettah Hospital,
for further treatment. However it was reported that the prisoner was
brought dead.
8. Thereafter Post mortem was conducted on 17.01.2012 and
the following injuries were found on the deceased body :-
“External injuries:-

removal of the calvarium thin film a red subdural
hemorrhage       and   patchy    areas   of   diffuse
subarachnoid hemorrhage over both cerebral
and both cerebellar hemispheres of the brain.”
The post mortem report also revealed that all the injuries are antemortem
in nature viz., 3 to 4 days prior to death. Further revealed that the injuries
2 & 9 could be accidental and injuries numbered 1-d,e,g,i,j,k,m,n,
o,p,r,s,t and u and injuries numbered 3,4,5,6,7 and 8 could be accidental
or could be inflicted by others. The injury No.9 is sufficient to cause
death in the ordinary course of nature.
9.  However, the second opinion was sought from the Professor
and Head of the Department, Department of Forensic Medicine and
Toxicology, Government Kilpauk Medical College, Chennai, that how
could the dark red contusion measuring 8X6Xscalp deep in the right
tempero occipital region of the scalp as mentioned in the injury No.9 of
the post mortem be caused? The said Professor answered that this could
be caused due to the impact of the head over the blunt surface, object,
during fall or impact of any object or weapon over that part of the head.
10. Therefore, the eighth respondent enquired the police
personnel of K7, ICF Police Station and other witnesses and after
enquiry, he found that it is a case of 304(ii) of IPC and altered the offence
under Sections 342, 343, 348, 324 & 304(ii) of IPC. The said alteration
report also filed before the learned Judicial Magistrate-I, Tiruvallur. Thus,
it is clear that the deceased was taken to the police station on 11.01.2012
during the night hours and he was produced before the learned
Magistrate only on 14.01.2012. The police personnel at K7 ICF Police
Station alone are responsible for the injuries sustained by the deceased.
The deceased was brutally beaten by the accused persons and due to
which he sustained grievous injuries and died.
11. There is great responsibility on the police authority to ensure
that the citizen in its custody is not deprived of his right to life. His liberty
is in the very nature of things circumscribed by the very fact of his
confinement and therefore his interest in the limited liberty left to him is
rather precious. The wrong doer is accountable and the State is
responsible if the person in custody of the police is deprived of his life
except according tot he procedure establish by law.
12. In the case on hand, the deceased was tortured and subjected
to third decree treatment due to which he died. The Hon'ble Supreme
Court of India repeatedly held that when the death taken place inside the
police station, the accused persons should be punished for the offence
under Section 302 of IPC. When the eighth respondent found that there
are materials to attract the major offence under Section 304(ii) of IPC,
what is the reason why the eighth respondent failed to alter the offence
under Section 302 of IPC? The injuries sustained by the deceased are
very clear and from the Post Mortem report, the cause of death clearly
shows that the police personnel had beaten the deceased and had given
third decree treatment. Therefore, it cannot be said that the accused
persons had no intension to murder the deceased.
13. The Hon'ble Supreme Court of India held in the case Rudul
Sah Vs. State of Bihar & anr reported in AIR 1983 SC 1086 that, one of
telling ways in which the violation of that right can reasonable be
prevented and due compliance with the mandate of Atricle 21 secured is
to mulct its violators in the payment of monetary compensation. The right
of compensation is some palliative for the unlawful acts of
instrumentalities which act in the name of public interest and which
present for their protection the powers of the State as a shield. If
civilisation is not to perish in this country as it has perished in some
others, too well known to suffer mention, it is necessary to educate
ourselves into accepting that, respect for the right of individuals is the
true bastion of democracy. Therefore, the State must repair the damage
done by its officers to the petitioner's right. It may have recourse against
those officers.
14. In the case on hand, poor young man aged about 22 years is
killed and his mother, young wife and his 8 years old child are the
dependents of the deceased. Therefore, it is clear case of murder and all
the accused persons shall be punished for the offence under Section 302
of IPC. The dependents of the deceased are entitled atleast for interim
compensation, since the provision under Section 357 A of Cr.P.C., says
about the order to pay compensation which reads as follows :-
“357. Order to pay compensation. (1) When a
Court imposes a sentence of fine or a sentence
(including a sentence of death) of which fine forms a
part, the Court may, when passing judgment order
the whole or any part of the fine recovered to be
(a) in defraying     the expenses properly
incurred in the prosecution;
compensation for any loss or injury caused by the
offence, when compensation is, in the opinion of the
Court, recoverable by such person in a Civil Court;
(c) when any person is convicted of any
offence for having caused the death of another
person or of having abetted the commission of such
an offence, in paying compensation to the persons
who are, under the Fatal Accidents Act, 1855 (13 of
1855), entitled to recover damages from the person
sentenced for the loss resulting to them from such
death; (d) when any person is convicted of any
offence      which      includes    theft,   criminal
misappropriation, criminal breach of trust, or
cheating, or of having dishonestly received or
retained, or of having voluntarily assisted in
disposing of, stolen property knowing or having
reason to believe the same to be stolen in
compensating any bona fide purchaser of such
property for the loss of the same if such property is
restored to the possession of the person entitled
thereto.
(2) If the fine is imposed in a case which is
subject to appeal, no such payment shall be made
before the period allowed for presenting the appeal
has elapsed, or if an appeal be presented, before the
decision of the appeal.
(3) When a Court imposes a sentence, of which
fine does not form a part, the Court may, when
passing judgment order the accused person to pay,
by way of compensation such amount as may be
specified in the order to the person who has suffered
any loss or injury by reason of the act for which the
accused person has been so sentenced.”
Accordingly, the compensation can be paid only on the conclusion of
trial. However, the dependents are entitled for interim compensation
when the prima facie case made out. Therefore, this Court has no
hesitation to award interim compensation payable by the State
Government to the dependents of the deceased.
15.   Accordingly, this Court is inclined to pass the following
(i)   The eighth respondent is directed to alter the offence into
302 of IPC as against the accused persons and proceed against them in
accordance with law and file final report within a period of eight weeks
from the date of receipt of a copy of this Order.
(ii)  The Government of Tamil Nadu is directed to pay a sum of
Rs.5,00,000/- (Rupess five lakhs only) as interim compensation to the
dependents of the deceased within a period of four weeks from the date of
receipt of a copy of this Order.
(iii) The said compensation shall be recovered from the accused
persons in the manner known to law.
16.   With the above directions, the Writ Petition stands allowed.
Consequently, connected miscellaneous petitions are closed. There shall
be no order as to costs.
