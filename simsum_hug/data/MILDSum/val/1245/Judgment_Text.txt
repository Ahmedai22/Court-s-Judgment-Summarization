This appeal is filed by the appellant-complainant
under Section 378 of Cr.P.C. for setting aside the
judgment of acquittal passed by the Second Additional
District   and   Sessions     Judge,   Davanagere    in
Crl.A.No.140/2010 dated 07.04.2011 and to confirm
the judgment of conviction and sentence passed by
the Principal Senior Civil Judge and CJM, Davanagere
in C.C.No.1303/2009 dated 18.10.2010.
2.    Heard the arguments of learned counsel for
the appellant and learned counsel for the respondent.
3.    The case of the appellant before the trial
Court is that he has filed a private compliant under
Section 200 of Cr.P.C. against the respondent-accused
for the offence punishable under Section 138 read
with Section 142 of the Negotiable Instruments Act,
1881 (for short 'N.I. Act') alleging that the accused
and complainant are known to each other. The father
of the respondent-accused - Bharamappa said to be
borrowed    Rs.2,60,000/-   from    the  complainant-
appellant on 07.03.2003 for his business and his
family necessities and agreed to pay 2% interest per
month by executing the on-demand promissory note
in favour of the complainant.   In the meantime, the
father of the accused - Bharamappa died leaving
behind his son-accused as a legal heir i.e., prior to
filing of the private complaint. On the death of
Bharamappa, the complainant asked the accused for
repayment of the loan amount and the accused
requested for sometime. But he has paid Rs.10,000/-
to    the  complainant   on    10.06.2005    and  the
complainant asked the accused to clear the dues
of his father. Later, the interest as well as principal
amount was calculated for Rs.4,50,000/- and the
accused said to be issued two cheques bearing
Nos.571677 and 571679 drawn on Vijaya Bank,
Davanagere Branch for the sum of Rs.2,25,000/- each
dated 07.06.2006 and 07.07.2006 respectively.      The
cheques were presented for encashment which came
to be dishonored as the account was closed. A notice
also served on the accused, but, he did not pay the
amount. Hence, the complaint came to be filed before
the Magistrate. After appearance of the respondent-
accused, plea was recorded, he claimed to be tried
and on behalf of the complainant, he has examined
himself as PW.1 and got marked 14 documents.
Statement of the accused under Section 313 of Cr.P.C.
was recorded and his case is one of the total denial
and he has not led any evidence.     After hearing the
arguments, the trial Court found the accused guilty
and convicted and sentenced to pay Rs.4,95,000/-
and in default, he shall undergo simple imprisonment
for one year. Out of which, Rs.4,50,000/- payable to
the complainant as compensation under Section 357
4.   The   judgment    of  conviction has  been
challenged by the accused before the Sessions Judge.
The Sessions Judge being the Appellate Court allowed
the appeal and set aside the conviction and sentence
passed by the trial Court and acquitted the accused.
Hence, the complainant is before this Court by way of
5.   The learned counsel for the complainant
has contended that the judgment of the First Appellate
Court is erroneous and also not correct. The accused
himself   has  undertaken     to  discharge  the  loan
borrowed by his father, but, he has paid Rs.10,000/-
by cash.    Subsequently, he has issued two cheques,
but the First Appellate Court failed to consider the
same and set aside the judgment of conviction and
sentence on the ground that there is no legally
enforceable debt which is not correct.     Therefore,
prayed for setting aside the judgment of acquittal and
confirm the conviction and sentence passed by the
6.    Per contra, the respondent counsel has
contended that there is no legally enforceable debt
payable by the accused in order to file complaint
against him. The debt is time barred. Therefore, the
learned counsel supported the judgment passed by
the First Appellate Court and hence, prayed for
dismissing the appeal.
7.     Having heard the arguments of learned
counsel for the parties and on perusal of the records,
the point that arises for my consideration are:
1)     Whether the complainant is able to
prove that there is legally enforceable
debt   payable   by   the    respondent-
2)     Whether the judgment of the First
Appellate Court is liable to be set aside ?
8.     It is not in dispute that the father of the
accused borrowed loan from the complainant and the
father of the accused died prior to filing of the private
complaint.    It  is  alleged    that   the   complainant
approached the accused to repay the loan, where the
accused undertaken to repay the loan and he said to
be issued two cheques.      The main contention of the
counsel for the accused is that there is no legally
enforceable    debt   payable    by    him   and   second
contention is time bound debt which cannot be
enforceable. In this regard, the learned counsel for
the appellant brought to the notice of this Court that
as  per   Section   29   of   the  N.I. Act,   the   legal
representative of the deceased person is liable to
discharge the liability of the father. The learned
counsel has relied upon the judgment of the Hon’ble
Supreme Court in the case of ICDS LTD. vs. BEENA
SHABEER AND ANOTHER reported in (2002) 6 SCC
9.    On perusal of Section 29 of the N.I. Act,
which defines as follows:
“29. Liability of legal representative signing
A legal representative of a deceased person
who signs his name to a promissory note,
bill  of  exchange     or   cheque   is  liable
personally   thereon unless he       expressly
limits his liability to the extent of the assets
received by him as such".
10.   As per Section 29 of the N.I. Act, the legal
representative of the deceased issued a cheque and
he is liable personally. That apart, as per the
judgment of the Hon’ble Supreme Court in the case of
ICDS LTD. stated supra, the Hon’ble Supreme Court
has upheld the judgment of the trial Court wherein in
the said case, a guarantor issued cheque towards
payment of the dues outstanding against the principal
debtor (hire-purchaser of car in the said case) and the
complaint was filed against the guarantor as the
cheque   issued     by    the   guarantor   came    to be
dishonored. Considering the judgment of the Hon’ble
Supreme Court, where, in this case, the accused is
none other than the son of the deceased-father who
borrowed the loan from the complainant and the
accused agreed to repay the same and he has issued
the cheque.       Such being the case, as a legal
representative of the father, the accused is liable to
repay the loan to the complainant.       Therefore, the
contention raised by the respondent counsel is not
acceptable and on the other hand, the complainant is
not able to prove the liability of the accused and the
cheque was dishonored, thereby, the accused is liable
for the punishment under Section 138 of N.I. Act and
the complaint is maintainable.
11.  In respect of the another contention raised
by the respondent that the debt is time barred one,
his father borrowed loan in the year 2003, the cheque
was issued after four years, therefore, there is no
liability. In this regard, the complainant has stated
and it is specifically mentioned that the accused has
undertaken to repay the amount and he has paid
Rs.10,000/-     within  two    years   and  specifically
mentioned that on 10.06.2005, the accused repaid
Rs.10,000/-     towards    his   father’s  liability and
thereafter in the year 2006, he has issued two
cheques on this behalf.     Therefore, once the amount
was already repaid, the question of taking contention
that it is barred debt does not arise and it gets
renewed.       Therefore,    the   accused    once   paid
Rs.10,000/- by cash and subsequently, he issued a
cheque to discharge the liability, he is liable for
discharging his liability of his father.  Therefore, the
trial Court has rightly convicted the accused as the
First Appellate Court not considered Section 29 of the
N.I. Act and has erred in acquitting the accused.
Therefore, the judgment of the First Appellate Court is
liable to be set aside.
12.   Accordingly, the appeal is allowed.
The judgment of the II Additional Sessions
Judge, Davanagere in Crl.A.No.140/2010 is hereby set
The   judgment    of   the   trial  Court   in
C.C.No.1303/2009 convicting the respondent-accused
is hereby upheld.
