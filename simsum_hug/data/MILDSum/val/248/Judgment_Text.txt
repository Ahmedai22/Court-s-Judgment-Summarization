4.    An RC was registered on 18.10.2016, where the petitioner was not

5.    The FIR is against unknown officials of the Ministry of Defence,
Government of India, M/s Embraer, Brazil, M/s Interdev Pte. Ltd Singapore
6.     It is stated that there were 3 fully modified Embraer Aircrafts EMB-
145 aircrafts which was purchased by DRDO.
7.     There was an agreement signed between M/s Embrarer, Brazil and
Director CABS, DRDO on 03.07.2008 for a consideration of 210 million
8.     It is stated that a sum of 5.76 million USD was paid to Mr. Vipin
Khanna through M/s Interdev Pte. Ltd Singapore in the year 2009 which was
alleged to have been used to influence the officials of Ministry of Defence.
9.     On 25.08.2022, the applicant has been arrested. He has filed this bail
application in which notice was issued on 09.09.2022.
10.    Mr. Bhardwaj, learned standing counsel for CBI along with other
investigating officer DSP Rajeev Rajan has filed a detailed reply, wherein he
has stated that Mr. Dev Inder Bhalla, Director of M/s Interdev Pte. Ltd
Singapore has stated that the agreement for receiving commission of USD

11.    It is further stated that the applicant was coordinating with him for

against the applicant.
14.    He further states that these are serious allegations and need to be
15.    The order dated 03.09.2022 rejecting the bail of the applicant is
predicated on 3 grounds namely:
 One, there is allegation of commission/kickback to the tune of 5.76
million USD.
 Two, the investigation is at nascent stage because of lack of
cooperation from foreign governments.
 Third, the magnitude of the offence is too huge.
16.    I am unable to agree with the contentions.
17.    In the present case, the case is of the year 2016. Almost more than 6
years have elapsed and it cannot, by any stretch of the imagination, be held
that the investigation is at a nascent stage. Six years is a long period of time.
18.    As regards the magnitude of the amount involved is concerned, I am
of the view that it cannot be a consideration to deny the right of liberty to an
individual. It is not the magnitude of the amount but the magnitude of the
offence and the prima facie involvement of the accused which is a
consideration for allowing or disallowing bail application.
19.    In the present case, the applicant has not been named in the FIR. The
allegations against the applicant are only based on statement of various
witnesses and official communications.
20.    The respondent should have and could have verified the same and in
case the same were found substantial, the charge-sheet should have been
filed.
21.    In addition, there is no Government official who has been named or
identified to have received kickbacks.
22.    The triple test is satisfied as:
23.     The applicant after registration of the FIR has travelled abroad 42
times and has returned on every occasion.
B.      Possibility of Tampering with Evidence:
24.     There has been no allegation or document placed on record which
shows that the applicant has tampered with the evidence.
25.      This apprehension can be taken care of by imposing restrictions.
26.      There is no allegation or document shown that he has influenced any
witnesses. This apprehension can also be taken care of by imposing
restrictions.
27.     Thus, the applicant satisfies the triple test.
28.     In view of the aforesaid, the bail application is allowed and the
applicant is directed to be released on bail, subject to the following
i.    The applicant shall furnish a personal bond with one local surety in
the sum of Rs. 25,000/- each, to the satisfaction of the Trial Court;
ii.    The applicant shall appear before the Court as and when the matter
is taken up for hearing;
iii.    The applicant shall provide his mobile number to the Investigating
Officer (IO) concerned, which shall be kept in working condition
at all times. The applicant shall not switch off, or change the same
without prior intimation to the IO concerned, during the period of
iv.     In case the applicant changes his address, he will inform the IO
concerned and this Court also;
v.   The applicant shall not indulge in any criminal activity during the
vi.   The applicant shall neither contact any of the witnesses nor tamper
with the evidence in any manner;
vii.   The applicant shall give prior intimation of his travel abroad with
detailed itinerary to the concerned Investigating Officer.
29.     The observations made by me are only prima facie and only for the
purpose of deciding the present bail application.
