1.     The present petition is a criminal revision petition filed by the
Revisionist Petitioner, an Indian Army colonel, with a prayer to set aside the
order dated 30.5.2018 passed by Ld. Family Court Tis Hazari in MT No.
78/2018 wherein the Court passed an order under Section 125 Cr.P.C
directing the Petitioner to pay a monthly maintenance of Rs.33,500/- to the
Respondent herein.
2.     Before delving into the merits of the case it would be important to
advert to the material facts of the case.
a)   The marriage of the Petitioner was solemnized on 22.12.2002
according to Sikh rites and rituals in accordance with the Hindu
Marriage Act, 1955. Out of the wedlock, they have two Children-
Suhani Singh aged 10 years and Shabad Singh aged 7 years old.
b)   The Revisionist Petitioner has been posted across the territory of
India as a result of his service in the Army. The Revisionist
Petitioner and the Respondent were peacefully married and
residing happily together until 2015 where the Petitioner alleges
that he found that the Respondent was in an adulterous
relationship with one of the petitioner’s senior in the army, who
was married and close with the family as well.
c)   In July 2015, it is stated that the Petitioner found out that the
Respondent      was   in   an   amorous    relationship   with    the
superior/family friend of the Petitioner. The Petitioner admittedly
checked the Respondent’s phone and discovered on her
WhatsApp, certain chats which were lascivious in nature, with
the Petitioners superior which was recorded by him to confront
the Respondent on her actions.
d)   It is stated that on 8.8.2015, the Petitioner hosted a dinner party
where he had invited both his and Respondent’s respective
parents and had invited his army superior/ paramour of the
Respondent and his spouse. The Petitioner all the time at the
party was wearing a body audio/tape recorder after the dinner
party was over he started by giving a speech and where in the
middle he spoke about the affair of Respondent No.2 and a
family face-off ensued which lasted for 30 minutes.
e)   The entire communication of that dinner party was recorded and
was transcribed and has been placed on record before this Court.
f)   Admittedly, after the dinner party the Petitioner made his
intentions very clear of wanting to separate from the Respondent
and sever all marital ties with her. The Petitioner firmly stated
before the families that he would have the custody of the
children. It is stated that the Respondent tried to apologize
numerous times but the same was not accepted by the Petitioner
and all attempts of reconciliation made by Respondent had
failed.
g)   The Respondent thereafter filed a slew of cases against the
Petitioner claiming different reliefs from him. Given below are
the cases that the Respondent has filed against the Petitioner.
i.    Maintenance Petition under Section 125 Cr.P.C.(MT-78
of 2018) filed before the Family Court, Tis Hazari which
has cumulated in the present Revision Petition.
ii.    Guardianship Petition (G.P. 45 of 2015) u/s 9 of the
Guardianship & Wards Act, 1890 filed before the PDJ,
iii.    Guardianship Petition No. 5 of 2015 before the Family

h)   It is stated that on 13.08.2015, the petitioner made a written
representation to Brigadier Ajay Vij. CDR 79 Mountain Brigade
against his superior who was allegedly in an amorous
relationship with the Respondent and appropriate proceedings
before the Armed Forces Tribunal had been initiated under
Section 45 of the Army Act 1950.
i)   Simultaneous proceedings at different locations have been going
on between the parties.
j)   In the petition for maintenance, the learned Family Court vide
order dated 10.04.2017 has granted Rs. 9000/- per month as ad
interim maintenance to the respondent herein which was directed
to be deposited in the bank account of the respondent herein on
7th day of each English Calendar month from the date of the
order. The Ld. Principal Judge, Tis Hazari on 30.05.2018 in the
proceedings initiated under Section 125 Cr.P.C has passed an
order directing the Revisionist Petitioner to pay a sum of Rs.
35,300/- per month as interim maintenance to the respondent
herein w.e.f. 01.01.2017 till the final disposal of the case and
retrospective maintenance of the amount of Rs. 9,000/- p.m. as
directed by the learned Family Court vide order dated
10.04.2017, from the date of filing of the Maintenance Petition
(2015) till December 2016.
k)   The petitioner has approached this Court challenging the order of
maintenance.
l)   Material on record indicates that the said chats have been
deemed adulterous in the proceedings initiated by the petitioner
herein under the Guardianship & Wards Court, Tis Hazari Court
while granting custody of the children to the Petitioner.
m) In the Guardianship Petition filed by the respondent herein, hte
learned Principal District Judge, Tis Hazari Courts, vide order
dated 22.8.2020 has stated reasons for not giving custody of the
children to the Respondent herein.
n)   During the pendency of the present petition before this Court, the
parties herein were referred to Delhi High Court Mediation
Committee vide order dated 15.10.2018. The Mediation failed.
3.    Heard both parties. The Petitioner and Respondent both appeared and
argued in person before this Court.
4.    The Revisionist Petitioner submitted that there are glaring
inconsistencies that were in the order as a result of suppression of facts made
by the respondent herein. He contends that the respondent is disqualified
from being given maintenance as she was in an adulterous relationship and
was living in adultery with an army senior of the Petitioner. He submits that
the Respondent and her paramour were having an affair behind his back and
the paramour was known to the couple as a family friend from the time they
had gotten married in 2002. He submits on this ground itself the sub-section
(4) of Section 125 CrPC is attracted which states that a person living in
adultery would not be eligible for claiming maintenance from her separated
spouse.
5.    The petitioner then submitted that the Respondent is disqualified from
receiving maintenance on the ground that she was employed as a teacher
previously and was making a living. It is submitted that the respondent has
an earning capacity and can maintain herself without the financial support of
the Petitioner as sanctioned by law. He contended that the Maintenance
Petition has been wrongly decided by the family court ignoring the Army
Order 02/2001 which governs the Petitioner’s case and Clause 4 of that
order lays down the Procedure for Processing Maintenance Cases. The
submission of the Petitioner is that since the Respondent’s maintenance
claim is to be decided in accordance with the Army Order, the same would
be decided by the Army officials of the Armed Tribunal and the jurisdiction
exercised by the Family Court is wrong and improper. Therefore, the entire
proceedings before the family Court is null & void, and the claim of
maintenance by the Respondent should be decided by the appropriate forum
in the Army.
6.     The Petitioner lastly submitted that the respondent has submitted an
overly inflated Income Affidavit before the Family Court. He states that she
has suppressed the fact that she is capable of earning, that she was
previously teaching in three different schools and that she has been living at
the residence of her parents, therefore she doesn’t need an accommodation
or rental. The Petitioner relies on the order dated 22.8.2020 passed in GP- 75
of 2015 by the Ld. PDJ, Tis Hazari and observations therein to show that the
conduct of the Respondent was adulterous and unbecoming of having the
custody of the children permanently.
7.     The Petitioner in support of his contentions and submissions has
placed reliance on many judgments on the proposition that living in adultery
bars a woman from claiming maintenance from the husband. He has placed
i. Bhushan Kumar Meen v. Mansi Meen, (2010) 15 SCC 372
ii. Reema Salkan v. Sumer Salkan, (2019) 12 SCC 303
iii. Rupali Gupta v. Rajat Gupta, 234(2016) DLT 693
iv. Damanreet Kaur v. Indermeet Juneja, (2012) SCC Online Del
8.     On the other hand, the Respondent would submit that the Petitioner
had deserted the Respondent without giving her a reason. She submits that
she was in a loveless marriage for resorted to initiate divorce, custody and
maintenance proceedings against him. She submitted that there is no
infirmity in the impugned order granting maintenance of Rs.35,300/- and the
revision petition is without any merits. She submitted that the Petitioner is
under an obligation imposed by CrPC to maintain her and he cannot escape
his responsibility even though their marriage has fallen apart. She submits
that the Petitioner has been an uncaring spouse who neglected her and the
children throughout the marriage and when the she decided to live separately
the Petitioner foisted the wild charge of adultery to avoid paying
maintenance to her. She submitted that she was working as a teacher in a
school in New Delhi only for a short period and the salary she was receiving
not enough to sustain herself and live as per the same standard as she lived
during her marriage. She submitted that the Petitioner has filed a false and
incorrect ITR and fake claims of paying EMI on a housing loan without
documentary evidence to substantiate the assertions. She submits that the
Petitioner and his family are more than financially able to give the
maintenance as they receive sufficient rental income from properties in New
Delhi, Noida and Mohali.
9.     The Respondent submitted that the Petitioner has misled the Family
Court, Tis Hazari submitting false, fake, fabricated and trumped up chats,
screenshots as evidence in the Guardianship Petition and got the custody of
the children through fraud. She submitted that one single incident adultery
would not disqualify a person from getting maintenance under Section 125
CrPC. She, lastly placed reliance on a number of case laws to state that the
Petitioner is bound to pay maintenance to the respondent under Section 125
CrPC. She relied on the following judgments-
i. Ravendra Singh v. Kapsi Bai, (2 1991 DMC 422)
ii. Chandrakant Gangaram Gawade v. Sulochana Chandrakant
iii. Chatubhuj v. Sitabai, (Criminal SLP No. 4379 of 2006)
10.    A perusal of the impugned order shows that the Trial Court while
fixing the interim maintenance has directed the petitioner herein to pay a
sum of Rs.35,300/- per month to the respondent herein w.e.f. 01.01.2017
and Rs.9,000/- per month w.e.f. date of filing of the petition till December,
2016. The order of the learned Trial Court giving the basis of the calculation
“For the purpose of calculation, it would be fair to
club the individual income and allot shares to all the
concerned parties. There is no other dependent of the
petitioner except his two children and the respondent
in question. Accordingly, allotting two units each to
adult member, one unit each to the minor children and
one extra unit to the petitioner who is maintaining a
separate household. The petitioner would be entitled
for 2+1+1+1= 5 units while respondent would be
entitled to two units.
Petitioner salary after statutory deductions is equal to
Rs.138310/-per month and respondent's salary is equal
to Rs. 6,000/- i.e. joint family income is equal to
Rs.144310/- . According, the respondent share would
=35220.5(rounded to Rs 35300/-).
Accordingly, the application U/s 125 (1) Cr.P.C. is
allowed and petitioner is directed to pay an amount of
Rs 35300/- per month to the respondent w.e.f.
01.01.2017 till the disposal of the case and
maintenance @ Rs, 9,000/- per month w.e.f. date of
filing of the petition till December, 2016.”
11.     The material on record discloses that the children are with the
petitioner herein from 2015 and, therefore, the respondent is not entitled to
two shares. The respondent is, therefore, entitled to only one share which
comes to Rs.20,615.7/- less Rs.6,000/- which is the salary of the respondent
herein per month. Therefore, the learned Trial Court ought to have granted
only Rs.14,615/- per month as interim maintenance to the respondent herein.
12.    The contention of the petitioner that he is covered by the Army Order
02/2001 and therefore the order passed by the learned Trial Court, fixing
maintenance is contrary to the Army Order 02/2001 does not hold water.
13.    The purpose of Section 125 Cr.P.C has been laid down by the
Supreme Court in several judgments. The object of Section 125 Cr.P.C is to
prevent vagrancy and destitution of a deserted wife by providing her for the
food, clothing and shelter by a speedy remedy. The object of Section 125
Cr.P.C is to bring down the agony and financial suffering of a women who
left her matrimonial home so that some arrangements could be made to
enable her to sustain herself and her child (refer: Chaturbhuj v. Sita Bai,
(2008) 2 SCC 316, and Bhuwan Mohan Singh v. Meena, (2015) 6 SCC
14.    The provisions of Section 125 Cr.P.C are in addition to other
provisions which provide for maintenance. However, the amount given
under Section 125 Cr.P.C is always taken into account before fixing
maintenance in other proceedings like the proceedings under the Protection
of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005, proceedings under Section
24 of the Hindu Marriage Act etc. It cannot be said that the Army Order
would over-ride the provisions of Section 125 Cr.P.C and that the Army
personnel are covered only by the Army Order and that Section 125 Cr.P.C
would not apply to Army Personnel.
15.    The fact that the respondent is capable of earning is also no ground to
deny interim maintenance to the respondent herein. Many a times wives
sacrifice their career only for the family.
16.    The petitioner has also raised the contention that since the respondent
is living in adultery she is not entitled to any maintenance under Section
125(4) Cr.P.C. The respondent has raised a very interesting argument stating
that even if the case of the petitioner is accepted then also one incident of
adultery cannot lead to a conclusion that the respondent is living in adultery.
17.    The relevant portion of the judgment dated 22.08.2020, awarding
custody of children to the petitioner herein, reads as under:
“15.18        Another very important aspect in
deciding custody matters is the preference of the minor
children. The undersigned had interacted with both the
minor children namely SSU, aged about 12 years, and
SSH, aged about 8 1/2 years, on 11.08.2020 in
chamber. Both the children are quiet clear in their
thinking and appear to be old enough to make an
intelligent preference. The interaction was recorded in
a memorandum of the substance of interaction. Both
the minor children are aware of the facts and
circumstances in which they are placed. 1 hey are able
to understand and comprehend the matter and think of
their own interest and welfare. Both the minor children
have stated that presently they are living with their
father,    paternal      grandfather      and     paternal
grandmother. They want to live permanently with their
father as their father loves them more and takes care of
them. They further stated that they are friendly with
their father. They share everything with their father,
grandfather and grandmother. They do not share
everything with their mother. They further stated that
except two to three days in a week their mother talk to
them daily on telephone. They also stated that they like
cantonment area and want to stay in cantonment area
only. They also stated that they have not faced any
problem in their schooling etc. while shifting, on
transfer of their father, from one station to another.
They also stated that they do not want to stay with their
mother. However, their mother can meet them on
weekends and during vacations. They can also stay
overnight with their mother during vacations, but only
for two to three days. As per Section 17 of the Act, if a
minor child is old enough to form an intelligent
preference, the court may consider that preference. It
is well settled that in such case, the court has to
consider the said preference.
15.19         It is also pertinent to note that as per the
respondent, the minor children are doing well in their
education and co-curriculum activities while staying
with him. He has produced copy of certificate/report
card of Master SSH, RW1/13 (colly.). The same is not
disputed. He has also produced printouts of 30
photographs of him, his children, his sister's children
and parents, RW1/23 (colly.). There appears to be no
doubt that the minor children are now well settled with
the respondent. They are progressing well while living
with the respondent. There is nothing on record to
indicate that the interests and welfare of the minor
children were in any manner affected during their stay
with the respondent during the last about five years.
15.20         In view of the aforesaid discussion and
from the matters before this court, it is clear that the
petitioner has been in a secretive and amorous extra-
marital relation with CGA. The same was the cause of
separation of the petitioner and the respondent. Such
conduct cannot be conducive to the interest and
welfare of the minor children. As earlier observed, the
petitioner has also not been a truthful witness. It is well
settled that moral and ethical aspects are equally, if
not more, important than other factors for the welfare
of the minor children. Further, presently, the petitioner
is not having any independent income /financial
stability. Admittedly, the petitioner has also earlier
twice attempted suicide. On the other hand, it appears
that the respondent would be able to provide a
financially stable life to the minor children. There is
nothing on record to indicate that he has not been or
cannot be a good father/parent. Further, and very
importantly, the minor children have categorically
shown their preference to live with the
respondent/father and in a cantonment area. The
minor children are well settled with the respondent. At
this juncture, it would not be in their interest to
unsettle them from their present environment. The issue
of custody of children has to, be decided on the basis of
the present circumstances.”
18.    A perusal of the abovementioned paras does not conclusively prove
that the respondent has committed adultery or is living in adultery.
19.    The issue as to whether the respondent is living in adultery or not can
be decided only after evidence is lead by both the parties.
20.    At the time of fixing interim maintenance this Court is not inclined to
go into this question at this juncture.
21.    Needless to state that if it is conclusively proved that the respondent
was living in adultery and was not entitled to maintenance at all, the learned
Trial Court can pass appropriate order for return of the maintenance amount
if it deems it fit and keeping in mind the object of Section 125 Cr.P.C is to
prevent vagrancy and destitution of a deserted wife.
22.     The revision petition is allowed in part. The petitioner is directed to
pay a sum of Rs. 14,615/- per month as interim maintenance to the
respondent herein w.e.f 01.01.2017. This Court is not inclined to disturb the
portion of the impugned order which has directed the petitioner herein to
pay a sum of Rs.9,000/- per month to the respondent herein w.e.f. date of
filing of the petition till December, 2016.
23.     Accordingly, the revision petition is allowed in part. All the pending
applications are disposed of.
