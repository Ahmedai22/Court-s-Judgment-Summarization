1.    The present petitions have been filed under Section 482 Cr.P.C. on
behalf of the petitioner seeking quashing of Complaint Case Nos.
627314/2016 and 618548/2016 arising out of the proceedings initiated
CRL.M.C. 2358/2021 & CRL.M.C. 2362/2021                                    Page 1 of 7
under Sections 138/141 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881
(hereinafter referred to as the N.I. Act). Additionally, the petitioner has
prayed for quashing of the order dated 07.04.2021 passed by the learned
Delhi, whereby his application seeking discharge/dropping of the
proceedings qua him has been dismissed.
2.      Briefly stated, the facts of the instant case are that respondent No.
1/complainant filed the aforesaid complaints under Sections 138/141 N.I.
Act claiming that the cheques in question were issued in its favour by the
accused company, i.e. Daily Life Retail and Trading Pvt. Ltd., and the same,
on presentation, were dishonoured and returned with the remarks ‘account
closed’. As a result, a legal notice dated 30.07.2010 was issued and on
failure of the accused persons to clear the outstanding payment in terms of
the cheques in question, the aforesaid complaints came to be filed.
3.      Learned counsel for the petitioner has sought quashing of the
complaint cases on the ground that only bald and vague allegations have
been made against the present petitioner, who was a dormant Director out
of the many Directors of the accused company. He submits that the
petitioner was not responsible for the running of day-to-day affairs of the
company. It is further stated that the petitioner was neither a signatory to
the Agreement dated 15.07.2008 executed between the complainant
company and the accused company, nor did he sign the cheques in question.
It is also submitted that the complaints are bereft of necessary ingredients
required under Section 138 N.I. Act. In support of his submissions, learned
counsel has placed reliance on the following decisions:-
i)    Meenu Goyal v. Micromax Informatics Ltd. and Others reported as
CRL.M.C. 2358/2021 & CRL.M.C. 2362/2021                                    Page 2 of 7
ii)  Sunita Palta & Ors v. M/s Kit Marketing Pvt Ltd reported as 267
iii) Dharna Goyal v. Aryan Infratech Pvt. Ltd. reported as
iv) Har Sarup Bhasin v. Origo Commodities India Pvt. Ltd. reported as
4.    Learned counsel for the petitioner has further invited attention to the
order dated 10.10.2019 passed by this Court in CRL.M.C. 5107/2019,
whereby the order dated 03.09.2019 passed by the learned Metropolitan
Magistrate framing notice under Section 251 Cr.P.C. was set aside and it
was directed that a fresh reasoned order be passed within a period of eight
weeks. He also invited attention to the particulars mentioned in Form-32
along with ROC records to submit that there are other Directors of the
accused company who have not been arrayed in the complaints.
5.    I have heard the learned counsel for the petitioner and gone through
the material placed on record as well as the decisions cited in support of his
submissions.
6.    A perusal of the aforesaid complaints would show that the
complainant alleged that the present petitioner, who has been arrayed as
accused No. 2, had agreed to guarantee repayment of all payments payable
by the accused company in terms of the Factoring Agreement. It was also
alleged that the present petitioner along with other accused persons was
in-charge and responsible for making financial decisions of the accused
company.
7.    One of the contentions raised on behalf of the petitioner is that he
was not served with any demand notice separately. However, the same does
not weigh with this Court in view of the decision in Kirshna Texport and
CRL.M.C. 2358/2021 & CRL.M.C. 2362/2021                                   Page 3 of 7
Capital Markets Limited v. Ila A. Agrawal and Others reported as (2015) 8
SCC 28, where the Supreme Court held as under:
“18. In our view, Section 138 of the Act does not admit of any
necessity or scope for reading into it the requirement that the
directors of the Company in question must also be issued individual
notices under Section 138 of the Act. Such Directors who are in
charge of affairs of the Company and responsible for the affairs of
the Company would be aware of the receipt of notice by the Company
under Section 138. Therefore, neither on literal construction nor on
the touchstone of purposive construction such requirement could or
ought to be read into Section 138 of the Act.”
8.      On an overview of the decisions cited by the learned counsel for the
petitioner, it is noted that the reliance placed on the decision in Meenu
Goyal (Supra) is misplaced. In the said case, even as per the complainant,
it was the husband of the petitioner with whom the entire business
transaction was conducted and he alone had signed the cheque in question.
Neither in the complaint nor in the pre-summoning evidence, any allegation
was levelled against the petitioner. Insofar as the decisions in Sunita Palta
(Supra) and Har Sarup Bhasin (Supra) are concerned, the same came to be
passed in cases where the petitioners were independent non-executive
Directors. In Dharna Goyal (Supra), a Coordinate Bench of this Court had
come to the conclusion that there were no specific allegations against the
petitioner who was the CEO of the accused company. As such, none of the
decisions on which reliance is placed by the learned counsel for the
petitioner, are applicable to the facts of the present case.
9.      Another contention raised on behalf of the petitioner is that as a
special condition precedent to the aforesaid Agreement, the accused
company was required to provide security cheques for the concerned
amount and it was in furtherance of the same that the cheques in question,
i.e. four cheques of Rs. 25,00,000/-, were given as security. The position of
CRL.M.C. 2358/2021 & CRL.M.C. 2362/2021                                  Page 4 of 7
law regarding the issue as to whether cheques in question were given as
security in a case under Section 138 N.I. Act is well-settled to the effect
that the same shall be a matter of trial. The Supreme Court in Sripati Singh
(Since Deceased) Through His Son Gaurav Singh v. State of Jharkhand and
Another reported as 2021 SCC OnLine SC 1002 has recently expounded
on the above lines. Relevant excerpt from the decision is extracted below:-
“19. …Therefore, prima facie the cheque which was taken as security
had matured for payment and the appellant was entitled to present
the same. On dishonour of such cheque the consequences
contemplated under the Negotiable Instruments Act had befallen on
respondent No. 2. As indicated above, the respondent No. 2 may have
the defence in the proceedings which will be a matter for trial. In any
event, the respondent No. 2 in the fact situation cannot make a
grievance with regard to the cognizance being taken by the learned
Magistrate or the rejection of the petition seeking discharge at this
stage.
23. …The further defence as to whether the loan had been discharged
as agreed by respondent No. 2 and in that circumstance the cheque
which had been issued as security had not remained live for payment
subsequent thereto etc. at best can be a defence for the respondent
No. 2 to be put forth and to be established in the trial. In any event,
it was not a case for the Court to either refuse to take cognizance or
to discharge the respondent No. 2 in the manner it has been done by
the High Court. Therefore, though a criminal complaint under
Section 420 IPC was not sustainable in the facts and circumstances
of the instant case, the complaint under section 138 of the N.I Act
was maintainable and all contentions and the defence were to be
considered during the course of the trial.”
10.    It is also worthwhile to reproduce the view taken recently in Sunil
Todi and Others v. State of Gujarat and Another reported as 2021 SCC
OnLine SC 1174, wherein the Supreme Court was in seisin of appeals
preferred by accused/appellants against the order of the High Court,
whereby petitions seeking quashing of criminal complaints filed under
CRL.M.C. 2358/2021 & CRL.M.C. 2362/2021                                    Page 5 of 7
Section 138 N.I. Act were dismissed. The Court observed thus:-
“53. The test to determine if the Managing Director or a Director must
be charged for the offence committed by the Company is to determine
if the conditions in Section 141 of the NI Act have been fulfilled i.e.,
whether the individual was in-charge of and responsible for the affairs
of the company during the commission of the offence. However, the
determination of whether the conditions stipulated in Section 141 of the
MMDR Act have been fulfilled is a matter of trial. There are sufficient
averments in the complaint to raise a prima facie case against them. It
is only at the trial that they could take recourse to the proviso to Section
141 and not at the stage of issuance of process.”
11.    From a reading of the judicial dicta on Section 141 N.I. Act and in
light of the discussion undertaken hereinabove, this Court is of the opinion
that the N.I. Act being a penal statute should receive strict construction.
Thus, specific averments in a criminal complaint which satisfy the
requirements of Section 141 N.I. Act are imperative. On a prima facie view
of the material placed on record in the present case, it is apparent that
specific allegations have been levelled against the petitioner. Apart from
the basic averment that the petitioner was in-charge of and responsible for
the day-to-day business of the accused company, it was further averred in
the complaint that the petitioner, being a Director, was in charge of the
financial decision-making of the accused company and he had agreed to
guarantee repayment of all amounts payable by the accused company to the
complainant in terms of the Factoring Agreement. Be that as it may, the
issue whether or not the conditions stipulated in Section 141 of the N.I. Act
have been fulfilled in the present case shall be a matter of trial in view of
the decision in Sunil Todi (Supra).
12.    In the opinion of this Court, on an overall reading of the complaints,
it cannot be said that the allegations levelled are bald and vague. The
petitioner has also not placed on record any material of unimpeachable
CRL.M.C. 2358/2021 & CRL.M.C. 2362/2021                                        Page 6 of 7
quality in support of his claim that he was a dormant Director which issue,
alongwith other defences raised, shall be a matter of trial. Suffice it to say,
the complaint cases ought not be quashed qua the petitioner at this stage.
13.    Keeping in view the aforesaid, I find no ground to entertain the
present petitions. Accordingly, both the petitions are dismissed and the
impugned order is upheld. Miscellaneous applications are disposed of as
infructuous.
14.    A copy of this order be communicated electronically to the
concerned Trial Court.
