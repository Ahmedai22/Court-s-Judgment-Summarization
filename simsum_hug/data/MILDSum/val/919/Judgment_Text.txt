According to the petitioner, she purchased a
'Winwin' lottery ticket bearing No.UBMYA-WNUND-
TDJAS(WB-649642).        The    date   of  draw   was  on
28.09.2015.        Ext.P1    is    the   lottery   ticket
alleged to be purchased by the petitioner.             On
28.09.2015,     the  results     of   the  lottery   were
published. It is the case of the petitioner that
the   ticket    purchased    by    the   petitioner   was
declared to have won the 1st prize.         As the claim
amount was more than one lakh, the petitioner
presented    the   claim   before    the  2nd  respondent
directly.    The claim was made within a period of
30 days as provided under the Paper Lotteries
(Regulation)     Rules,   2005(hereinafter      mentioned
as   'the   Rules').       The    original    Ext.P1  was
submitted      before     the     2nd    respondent    on
15.10.2015.       After   submitting     the   original
lottery ticket to the 2nd respondent along with
all necessary documents in terms of Rule 9, the
2nd respondent intimated the petitioner that the
documents were incomplete.         The 2nd respondent
directed    the  petitioner    to   submit   a  Stamped
receipt      and    attested      copy     of    Ration
card/Election    Identity    card.     Ext.P2   is  the
communication.       On  receipt     of   Ext.P2,   the
petitioner      has    submitted      the     residence
certificate and stamped receipt.           Exts.P4 and
P4(a) are the     residence certificate and stamped
receipt.     Though, the required documents were
received by the 2nd respondent as early as on
November 2015, the petitioner submitted that the
2nd respondent has not disbursed the prize money
Thousand only) after deducting the income tax
and agents prize from the 1st prize amount of
Rs.65,00,000/-(Rupees Sixty Five Lakh only).         In
such   circumstances,   the    petitioner    approached
this       Hon'ble     Court      by     filing     W.P.
(C)No.15708/2019.       Ext.P5 is the counter filed
by the 2nd respondent in the above writ petition.
Thereafter this Court disposed the above writ
petition as per Ext.P7 judgment directing the 1 st
respondent     to   consider   the    matter  and   pass
appropriate orders.       Accordingly, the matter was
considered by the 1st respondent.        The petitioner
submitted Ext.P10 written submission also before
the    1st   respondent.        Thereafter,     the   1st
respondent     passed   Ext.P11   order  rejecting   the
claim of the petitioner to get the prize amount
of Ext.P1 lottery ticket.       Aggrieved by Ext.P11,
this writ petition is filed.
2.    Heard   the    learned    counsel   for   the
petitioner     and  the   learned   Special  Government
Pleader        to      the      Advocate        General,
3.    The learned counsel for the petitioner
reiterated his contentions in the writ petition.
The learned counsel submitted that Ext.P11 order
is   unsustainable     for   the  simple    reason   that
there is    no law allowing the Government to pass
such an order.       The learned counsel submitted
that the petitioner purchased the lottery from
an   agent   at   Palakkad.       Simply    because   the
petitioner is the wife of the owner of a lottery
agency   named   'Manjoo    Lottery    Agency',   against
whom there is some allegations, the prize amount
can not be denied to the petitioner.
4.   The learned Special Government Pleader
submitted that the petitioner is a partner of
Manjoo Lottery Agency, of course the same is
denied    by    the     learned    counsel      for   the
petitioner.       The    contention     of  the   learned
Special     Government      Pleader      is   that    the
petitioner    is    the    wife   of    P.Muraleedharan,
Murali Nivas Kadambur P.O., Kannur who was a
lottery    agent    of    lottery    Department    having
agency No.C3387 and also the Managing Partner of
Manjoo Lottery Agency.        According to the learned
Government Pleader, the Agency in the ownership
of   the   above    person    was  suspended     by  the
department for involving in unlawful practice in
lottery   business.      For   the   said   reason,  the
Director of State Lotteries, 2nd respondent had
declined the claim in respect of the petitioner.
The learned Government Pleader also relied on
Clause 3 of Ext.P6 circular.
5.   After hearing both sides and perusing
the documents, I am not in a position to accept
the   finding   in    Ext.P11.      According    to  the
respondents,    the    petitioner    is   the   wife  of
Sri.P.    Muraleedharan,      who   is    the   Managing
Partner of Manjoo Lottery Agency.           But that is
not a reason to deny the prize money of lottery
which according to the petitioner purchased by
her from another agent in Palakkad District.           I
specifically     asked     the    learned     Government
Pleader to point out a law which authorise the
Government to pass Ext.P11 order.           The learned
Government Pleader takes me through Rule 9(8) of
2005 and fairly conceded that there is no other
provision.        It will be better to extract the
Rule     9(8)of       the    Kerala     Paper    Lotteries
“(8)Prize    money   shall   be   paid   after
ascertaining the genuineness of the Prize ticket.
However, payment of prizes above Rs. 100 shall be
made    after   matching  it   with   the  concerned
counterfoil kept in the office.”
6.    From a reading of the above regulation,
it is clear that the duty of the authority is
only to find out whether the lottery ticket is
genuine.       Admittedly,     there    is  absolutely    no
dispute about the genuineness of Ext.P1.                  In
such circumstances, the above Rule is not at all
applicable.        In the counter affidavit filed on
behalf of the 1st respondent, it is also conceded
that    there      is   no   law    which    prohibit    the
petitioner from purchasing the lottery tickets
either from the husband or from any other person
and presenting the same for cash in the event of
winning prize. The petitioner was in possession
of Ext.P1 lottery ticket and she produced the
same before the authority concerned for getting
the prize money.                      Now based on certain surmises
and  certain              observations,                    the      1st     respondent
rejected the claim of the petitioner.                                           It will
be better to extract the relevant portion of
7.       If the above finding is correct, even
criminal offence may attract.                                           Admittedly the
petitioner produced Ext.P1 ticket before the 2nd
respondent on 15.10.2015.                               About 6 years elapsed
thereafter.                Admittedly,                  no      criminal          case      is
registered              against               the            petitioner           at       the
instance of the respondents even now.                                                If the
allegations mentioned in Ext.P11 are true, the
respondents ought to have registered atleast a
criminal case against the petitioner.             No such
case is registered as on today.          Moreover, there
is no law which authorise the Government to pass
an   order    like     Ext.P11.        Admittedly,      the
petitioner was in possession of Ext.P1 lottery
ticket   and   says   that,     she  purchased    it   from
another agent.       There is nothing to disbelieve
the   same,   except    the   wild    guess   of   the   1 st
respondent.     She produced the same before the
authorities     as    per    the    Rules.       In    such
circumstances,     the   petitioner     is  entitled    the
prize money.     According to me, Ext.P11 will not
stand because it is passed without backing of
law.      I   don't     want    to   make   any    further
observation.      All other contentions of the 1st
respondent against the husband of the petitioner
are left open because he is not a party in this
proceedings.     But when the petitioner produced a
lottery ticket in accordance to the Rules with a
claim    that,    it   got    the    first   prize,     the
petitioner    is   entitled   the  prize    amount, if
there is no evidence to doubt the genuineness of
the prize ticket.
Therefore, this writ petition is allowed in
i)   Ext.P11 order is set aside.
ii) The     2nd  respondent    is    directed  to
disburse the prize amount which the petitioner
is   entitled     after  statutory    deductions,   as
expeditiously as possible, at any rate, within
two months from the date of receipt of a copy of
this judgment.
