Intelligence Officer for deciding all these appeals,
brief facts of which are as under:-
2.1 On 11.01.2018, car bearing No. KA 39 M 2117

“D.R.I.”), Hyderabad at toll plaza, Kamkole
District,     Telangana      in   which   appellants
(driver and two men) were travelling.             The
appellants    along    with   other    two    persons
introduced themselves on being asked as to
whether they have secreted anything illegal
in  the   car,     the  appellant’s     replied    in
negative. The Officers searched the car and
found false casing behind the rear seats on
the side walls of the boot of the car with
metal doors.     The appellants’ opened the door
and few transparent packets with off-white
coloured   packets    were  found   in   the   casing
attached   to   the   walls  of  the    boot.     The
appellants’     told    that   packets     were    of
Narcotic drug, which were loaded in the car
by a person named Suraj at Omerga, Osmanabad
District    Maharashtra,     which    were     to  be
delivered    at   Chennai.      The    Officers    in
presence of Panchas and the appellants opened
the packet and tested the materials in the
packet.     The appellants were taken to the
office   of   D.R.I.,    Hyderabad.       The   total
quantity of packets (Methaqualone) weighed to
2.2 On 12.01.2018, the appellants were arrested
in exercise of power conferred under Section
42 of NDPS Act, 1985 (hereinafter referred to
as   “Act,   1985”).       The   D.R.I.    officers
prepared   a   crime   report   against    all  the
accused-appellants for commission of offence
under Sections 22, 28 and 29 of NDPS Act and
produced them before the VI Additional CMM,
Hyderabad.   The duty Magistrate on 12.01.2018
allowed the application for remand and the
appellants were remanded till 25.01.2018.        On
25.01.2018,    the   appellants-accused     persons
were   produced   before   the  Special    Sessions
Judge Court, D.R.I., Hyderabad.          Remand of
the   appellants   was   extended   from   time  to
time.     On  10.07.2018    the  appellants    were
remanded only for two days since 180 days
prescribed    for   filing   charge    sheet   were
coming to an end on 12.07.2018.
2.3 On 12.07.2018, since 180 days had expired,
the    appellants     filed   bail    application.
granted bail to the appellants under Section
167(2) Cr.P.C. On 12.07.2018, a letter was
received from the Additional Sessions Judge,
Omerga, Maharashtra asking to handover the
custody of appellants to D.R.I., Bangalore as
they  were   required    to    appear   before    the
Maharashtra in Special Case (NDPS) No.17 of
2018.   The Sessions Court, Hyderabad granted
the custody of three accused on 13.07.2018 to
the  D.R.I.,   Bangalore.       D.R.I.,    Bangalore
produced   the   appellants     before   Additional
Sessions    Judge,     Omerga,     Maharashtra     on
14.07.2018   where    they    were   remanded    till
2.4 On   02.08.2018,     D.R.I.,     Bangalore      filed
application     before     the     Special    Court,
Hyderabad   to   transfer    the   records   in   the
Hyderabad case to Omerga Sessions Court.           On
24.08.2018,    the    Special     Sessions    Judge,
Hyderabad   transferred     the    records   to   the
Maharashtra came to know that the appellants-
accused  have   already   been   granted    bail  on
12.07.2018 before which date charge sheet was
already  filed   before    the   Omerga   Court   on
06.07.2018    which   was    taken   on    file   on
11.07.2018 A show cause notice was issued to
D.R.I., Bangalore to give explanation. The
D.R.I., Bangalore filed an application for
cancellation   of   bail  under    Section    439(2)
Cr.P.C. in the High Court by filing Criminal
Petition No. 10524 of 2018.        The High Court
by   the   impugned    order    dated   30.11.2018
cancelled   the   bail   granted    under    Section
167(2) Cr.P.C. dated 12.07.2018.          Aggrieved
against  the   order   dated    30.11.2018,    these
appeals have been filed by the three accused-
appellants.
3.  This Court on 22.02.2019 noticed that only one of
the  appellants,   i.e.,   Villayutham     Nagu,   has   been
released   in  pursuance    of   the    bail   order    dated
12.07.2018, interim order was passed in the special
leave petition filed by Villayutham Nagu alone and
other   two   appellants     being   still    under   custody,
notices were issued in all the matters.
4.   We have heard Shri M. Karpaga Vinayagam, learned
senior   counsel   for   the   appellants.    Shri   Vikramjit
Banerjee,    learned  Additional     Solicitor    General   has
appeared for the respondent.
5.   Learned senior counsel for the appellants submits
that   before the    Special Judge,      Hyderabad when     the
case was taken on 12.07.2018 neither any charge sheet
was filed before the Special Court Hyderabad nor any
information was given to the Special Court that any
charge    sheet   has   been     filed    in   Omerga   Court,
Maharashtra.      No complaint under Section 36A(d) of
NDPS Act having been filed by 12.07.2018 by which
period,   180   days  had   lapsed,    the   learned   Special
Court had granted default bail on 12.07.2018 to all
the   appellants.      The    accused    were    entitled   for
default bail under Section 167(2) Cr.P.C.              Learned
Senior   counsel   submits    that   instead    of  filing   an
application for cancellation of the bail before the
Special    Court   under   Section    439(2)     Cr.P.C.,   the
respondent    approached   before    the   High   Court   under
Section  439(2)   Cr.P.C.      When   the  bail  order  was
passed by the Special Court, D.R.I., Bangalore ought
to  have   informed   the   Special    Court   seeking  the
cancellation of the bail by giving explanation as to
why the fact of filing combined complaint was not
informed to the Special Court.        It is submitted that
recovery  of contraband    from accused      by the  D.R.I.
Hyderabad is entirely different from the Omerga case,
which is relating to the recovery of the contraband
manufactured at the factory situated at Omerga.         The
appellants are to be charged only for the offence of
possession and the transport.       The appellants have no
role to play with reference to the manufacture of
contraband in the factory at Omerga.        The seizure of
the contraband was made by the D.R.I., Hyderabad on
11.01.2018 only during the time between 12 PM to 3:30
PM at Hyderabad whereas the recovery of contraband
from the factory at Omerga was made by the D.R.I.,
Bangalore   only  on   11.01.2018    at   4.30  PM  and  on
12.01.2018.    It is further submitted that when the
Special Court was not informed either on 10.07.2018
or 12.07.2018 that any charge sheet has been filed on
06.07.2018, no error was committed by Special Court
in  granting the   default bail      under Section    167(2)
6.   Learned Additional Solicitor General refuting the
submissions   of the   learned senior      counsel for   the
appellants   contends   that   the   appellant’s   Car   was
intercepted   at Hyderabad    on basis     of specific   and
credible   information   that    huge    quantity  of   NDPS
substance being illegally manufactured in premises of
M/s. Pragati Electrical Work Omerga, which is being
transported to Chennai.       A total of 45.874 Kgs of
NDPS substance from the appellants was seized on the
basis   of  specific  intelligence.      In   the voluntary
statements of accused Nos. 5, 6 and 7 (appellants),
recorded   under  Section    67   of   the   Act,  1985   in
connection   with   the   seizure     of   45.874  Kgs.   of
substance, they have stated that started from Omerga
for Chennai. It is submitted that a combined charge
sheet has been filed taking into consideration the
entire sequence of events including the seizure of
45.874 Kgs. NDPS substance by D.R.I., Hyderabad in
which present appellants are accused Nos. 5, 6 and 7.
It  was due     to non-communication      of information     of
combined complaint having been filed on 06.07.2018,
the   order    was   passed   by    the   Special    Court   on
12.07.2018 granting default bail whereas on the same
day,   a    letter    was   received    by    Special   Court,
Hyderabad where the Special Court, Omerga has asked
for the custody of the accused.           All the appellants
filed a bail petition on 18.07.2018 before the Omerga
Court    under     Section    439    Cr.P.C.,     which    bail
application was subsequently withdrawn on 25.09.2018.
On 31.10.2018, upon fulfilling the conditions by one
of the accused, Villayutham Nagu, the learned Omerga
Court   was   pleased   to  release    the  said   accused   on
31.10.2018 and rest of the two accused are still in
Osmanabad Jail.      The High Court rightly cancelled the
bail,   which    was   earlier    granted    by  the   learned
Special Judge and the combined complaint having been
filed on 06.07.2018, which was also taken on file on
11.07.2018,     the   appellants   were    not  entitled    for
grant of default bail under Section 167(2) Cr.P.C.
7.   We have considered the submissions of the learned
counsel for the parties and have perused the records.
8.   The appellants’ car by which they were travelling
from    Omerga    to   Hyderabad      on    11.01.2018    was
intercepted    by  the   D.R.I.    officials   of   Hyderabad
Zonal Unit near the Kamkole near Hyderabad and from
the   possession   of   the   appellants     45.874   Kgs  of
narcotic substance was recovered.        Appellants’ in the
statement recorded under Section 67 of NDPS Act have
stated that they have started from Omerga to Chennai
in the car in which the narcotic substance was being
transported.      The   remand     of  the   appellants   was
extended from time to time till 12.07.2018 by Special
Court,    Hyderabad.      On     11.01.2018,    recovery   of
narcotic substance was also made at Omerga in the
factory premises of M/s Pragati Electrical Work, MIDC
Omerga, Maharashtra, on which D.R.I. has registered a
case and a combined complaint dated 06.07.2018 was
submitted by Intelligence Officer, D.R.I., Bangalore
before the Special Court, Omerga.           Complaint under
Section   36A(1)(d)   of   NDPS   Act   for  offences   under
Section 8(c) punishable under Section 21(c), 22(c),
23(c), 28 and 29 read with Section 38 of the NDPS Act
has  been  filed    dated   06.07.2018    by   Intelligence
Officer, D.R.I. in Omerga Court.       The appellants have
been made accused Nos. 5, 6 and 7 in the complaint.
The combined complaint has been brought on the record
by the respondent alongwith additional documents in
which with regard to accused Nos. 5, 6 and 7, i.e.,
appellants   in   these   appeals,     apart    from  other
allegations and facts, following has been stated in
“110.      The complainant submits that,
accused   No.    5,   6    and   7   i.e.    Shri
Balasubramaniyan (A6) and Shri Vijay Kumar
L (A7), who were possessing / carrying the
“Ketamlne Hydrochloride” a psychotropic
substance in commercial quantity in their
car bearing No. KA-39-M-2117 from Omerga
to Chennai and the same was seized on
11.01.2018. Hence, they had committed an
offence under Section 8(c) and 9A are
liable to be punished under Section 21(c),
Section 22(c), Section 23(c) read with
Section 28, Section 29 and Section 38 of
the NDPS Act, 1985.
111.    Ketamine Hydrochloride seized from
accused No. 5, 6 and 7 under Mahazar dated
11.01.2018,     under    Mahazar     dated    11/
12.01.2018 and under 11.02.2018 have been
submitted    to   the    Hon’ble    Court    vide
various Memos in a sealed cover are liable
for confiscation under the provisions of
Section 60, 61, 62 and 63 of the NDPS Act.
This Hon'ble Court may be pleased to pass
appropriate     order  relating    to    the
confiscation of the above said goods in
terms of Section 63 of the NDPS Act.
9.  The High Court in the impugned judgment noted
that charge sheet having been filed on 06.07.2018,
i.e., well within the stipulated period of 180 days,
the accused could not have been granted the benefit
under Section 167 Cr.P.C.    In paragraph 8, following
has been observed by the High Court:-
“8. ……………….It can be culled out from the
record that filing of the single charge
sheet on 06.07.2018 before the Additional
Sessions Court, Omerga, was not brought to
the notice of the Metropolitan Sessions
Court, Hyderabad for whatever reason may
be. Since the factual aspect remains that
the charge sheet was filed on 06.07.2018
i.e., well within the stipulated period of
180 days, the respondents-accused are not
entitled for the benefit under Section
167(2) Cr.P.C. Under these circumstances,
the respondents-accused are entitled for
bail in accordance with the provisions
laid down under the NDPS Act read with
Sections     437   and     439    Cr.P.C.    and
accordingly they are entitled to work out
the remedies under the said provisions.”
10. It is true that the bail granted under Section
167(2)   Cr.P.c.   could   have    been   cancelled   under
Section 439(2) Cr.P.C.. This Court in Pandit Dnyanu
Khot Vs. State of Maharashtra and Ors., (2008) 17 SCC
745  while considering    the case     where bail   granted
under  Section   167(2)  Cr.P.C.     was  cancelled   under
Section   439(2)  Cr.P.C.   by   learned   Sessions   Judge
after  noticing   the  facts    upheld   the  order   under
Section 439 Cr.P.C. cancelling the bail.        Paragraphs
7, 8 and 9 of the judgment are as follows:-
“7. In the present case, against the
accused, FIR for the offences punishable
under Sections 302, 307, 147, 148, 149,
324 and 323 IPC and Section 27 of the Arms
Act was registered. The accused were
arrested on 28-10-2000 and were produced
before the Judicial Magistrate. They filed
an application under Section 167(2) CrPC
on 25-1-2001 for releasing them on bail on
the ground that charge-sheet was not
submitted within the stipulated time and
the court released them on bail on the
same date by exercising jurisdiction under
Section 167(2) CrPC. The State filed an
application on 31-1-2001 under Section
437(5) and Section 439(2) CrPC before the
Sessions Judge, Kolhapur for cancellation
of bail. Before the said application could
be   finally  disposed   of,  the   accused
preferred an application Ext. 8 submitting
that an application under Sections 437(5)
and 439(2) was not maintainable before the
Sessions Court and the State ought to have
approached the learned Magistrate for
cancellation of the bail. That application
was rejected by the learned Additional
Sessions Judge by order dated 3-3-2001.
Thereafter,    the    learned    Additional
Sessions Judge by judgment and order dated
2-5-2001 allowed the said application and
set aside the order passed by the Judicial
Magistrate on the ground that the accused
were released on the 89th day, that is,
before expiry of 90 days.
8. In our view, it appears that the High
Court has committed basic error in not
referring to the provisions of Section
439(2) CrPC which specifically empower the
High Court or the Court of Session to
cancel such bail. Section 439(2) reads as
“439. Special powers of High Court
or Court of Session regarding
Session may direct that any person
who has been released on bail
under this Chapter be arrested and
commit him to custody.”
9. The proviso to Section 167 itself
clarifies that every person released on
bail under Section 167(2) shall be deemed
to be so released under Chapter XXXIII.
Therefore, if a person is illegally or
erroneously released on bail under Section
167(2), his bail can be cancelled by
passing appropriate order under Section
439(2) CrPC. This Court in Puran v.
Rambilas [(2001) 6 SCC 338] has also
clarified that the concept of setting
aside an unjustified, illegal or perverse
order   is    totally   different  from   the
concept of cancelling the bail on the
ground that the accused has misconducted
himself or because of some new facts
requiring such cancellation.”
11. It is not even submitted before us that Omerga
Court where common complaint has been filed against
the accused had no jurisdiction to inquire and try
the offence.      It was due to some miscommunication
that  at   the  time   when  Court passed  the  order  on
12.07.2018,    the    factum    of filing   of   combined
complaint dated 06.07.2018 was not brought into the
notice of Special Court, Hyderabad.     Although, letter
of the same date 12.07.2018 was received by Special
Court, Hyderabad from Special Court, Omerga praying
for custody of the appellants, which custody was also
granted by the Special Court, Hyderabad on the next
day, i.e., 13.07.2018.      All these facts were brought
before  the   High   Court  in   application   filed  under
Section 439(2) Cr.P.C. and the High Court has rightly
cancelled the bail order dated 12.07.2018.        We do not
find  any   error   in  the   order   of  the   High  Court
cancelling the bail order dated 12.07.2018.
12. It is true that two offences, one at Hyderabad
being  at the    instance of    D.R.I., Hyderabad    namely
D.R.I. 48 of 2018 was registered and another case
Special NDPS No. 17 of 2018 by the D.R.I., Bangalore,
Zonal Unit.    A combined complaint taking care of both
the  offences   was   filed  before   the   Special  Court,
Omerga as noted above wherein offences committed by
the accused were also inquired and dealt with.        There
is   ample   material    in   the    complaint   that   the
transportation    of  narcotic    substance   started  from
Omerga,  Maharashtra and     was being    allegedly to   be
taken to Chennai and intercepted at Hyderabad.          The
complaint, which has been brought on the record gives
the  detailed    facts   including   the    journey  and  the
interception     of   appellants    at    Hyderabad.      The
combined complaint having been filed on 06.07.2018,
i.e., well within 180 days, the High Court did not
commit   any   error   in  cancelling     the   default  bail
granted to the appellants on 12.07.2018.
13. We, thus, are of the view that there is no ground
for interfering with the impugned judgment /order of
the High Court.       We have noted above that regular
bail application under Section 439 Cr.P.C. was filed
before the Omerga Court by the appellants, which was
withdrawn on 25.09.2018, we are of the view that it
is  open   for   the  appellants    to   file   regular  bail
application    before   Omerga   Court   under   Section  439
Cr.P.C.   afresh, which     may be   considered on     merits
without being influenced by any observations made by
the order passed by the High Court in the impugned
judgment   or   observations   made   by   us.    We  further
observe   that   bail  application    to   be  filed  by  the
appellants under Section 439 Cr.P.C. be considered
and decided expeditiously. The order dated 12.07.2018
having been set aside by the High Court, which order
having been confirmed by this Court, the appellant,
Villayutham Nagu is to surrender before the Special
Court, Omerga. All the appeals are dismissed subject
to liberty granted to the appellants as above.
