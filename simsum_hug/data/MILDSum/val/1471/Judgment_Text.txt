This Criminal Original Petition has been filed to quash the
proceedings in C.C.No.61 of 2015, pending on the file of the Judicial
2.The 2nd respondent company lodged a complaint against the
petitioner before the 1st respondent Police on 18.05.2003 and the same
was registered in Crime No.166 of 2003, for offence under Section 457
and 420 IPC. Gist of the complaint is that the 2nd respondent is the
company viz., M/s.Micro Electric Controls, Periyanaickenpalayam,
Coimbatore. The petitioner was employed as Machine Operator in the
2nd respondent company in the year 1998. On 29.07.1998, the petitioner
gave resignation letter to the 2nd respondent company in presence of
LW2, LW4 & LW5 that he was unable to continue with his work. On
30.07.1998, the petitioner's dues settled and he was relieved from the
service. Suppressing the same, the petitioner filed a case before the
Labour Court, Coimbatore in I.D.No.332 of 1999 claiming that his
signature found in the resignation letter, dated 29.07.1998 is forged and
that he used to sign without any line, but in the resignation letter, there is
a line below the signature. After proper adjudication, I.D.No.332 of
1999 ended in favour of the petitioner on 11.03.2002. Aggrieved by the
award passed by the Labour Court, Coimbatore, dated 11.03.2002, the 2 nd
respondent filed a Writ Petition in W.P.No.7781 of 2003 before this
Court and also filed W.M.P.No.10000 of 2003 for stay of operation of
award, dated 11.03.2002, wherein this Court, by order, dated 12.03.2003
had granted interim stay directing the 2nd respondent company to deposit
the entire backwages to the petitioner. Challenging the order of stay,
dated 12.03.2003,          the 2nd respondent       preferred   an appeal           in
W.A.No.1666 of 2003 and this Court, by order, dated 24.08.2006
confirmed the order of the stay, dated 12.03.2003. Thereafter, this Court,
by order, dated 23.12.2009 dismissed the Writ Petition in W.P.No.7781
of 2003.
3.The petitioner filed a petition in C.P.No.52 of 2010 before the
Labour Court, Coimbatore seeking arrears of his wages and to comply
with the order of the Labour Court, Coimbatore in I.D.No.332 of 1999.
Thereafter, the 2nd respondent company filed Interlocutory Application in
I.A.No.287 of 2015 in C.P.No.52 of 2010 to pass an order to send the
documents to the Forensic Lab and the same was dismissed on
01.06.2015.         Thereafter, C.P.No.52 of 2010 ended in favour of the
petitioner, against which, the 2nd respondent company filed a Writ
Petition in W.P.No.150 of 2022 and the same is pending. Further, the 2nd
respondent filed Crl.O.P.No.1 of 2012 under Section 340 r/w 195(i)(b) of
Cr.P.C., before the Labour Court, Coimbatore and the same was
dismissed on 24.07.2017.
4.In the year 2004, the FIR registered against the petitioner in
Crime No.166 of 2003 was closed as Mistake of Fact for the reason that
the forged resignation letter was not produced and served the notice in
R.C.S.No.230 of 2004, dated 17.06.2004 to the 2nd respondent company.
Thereafter, in the year 2006, the trial Court destroyed the records in
Crime No.166 of 2003. After termination of the proceedings before the
Labour Court, Coimbatore as well as before this Court, the original
resignation letter was obtained from the Labour Court, Coimbatore and
the 2nd respondent company filed a petition for further investigation
under Section 173(8) Cr.P.C., on 17.11.2012 in C.M.P.No.908 of 2013 in
Crime No.166 of 2003 before the trial Court.         At that time, the 2 nd
respondent company was informed about the destruction of case records,
hence, he filed a petition in C.M.P.No.899 of 2013 for reconstruction of
the case records in Crime No.166 of 2003. The trial Court, by order,
dated 06.02.2013 ordered reconstruction of the destroyed records and for
further investigation in Crime No.166 of 2003.                During further
investigation, the resignation letter was sent for forensic examination,
where the handwriting expert confirmed that the signature of the
petitioner and the signature found in his resignation letter are one and the
same.         Finding that the petitioner has committed the forgery and
cheating, the 1st respondent Police filed final report listing LW1 to LW8
and several documents before the trial Court. The trial Court finding
prima facie case against the petitioner, took the case on file in C.C.No.61
of 2015, against which, the present Quash Petition.
5.The learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that the
petitioner worked as Machine Operator in the 2nd respondent company in
the year 1998. On 29.07.1998, he had given a resignation letter stating
that he is no more interested in continuing with his job and asked for his
backwages. Based on his resignation letter, he was relieved from service
on 30.07.1998. Thereafter, he disputed his resignation letter and claimed
that the resignation letter was forged one and thereafter, he filed a
Industrial Dispute case in I.D.No.322 of 1999 before the Labour Court,
Coimbatore.     The Labour Court, Coimbatore by an award dated
11.03.2002 found that the alleged resignation letter, which has been
marked as Ex.P3 has not been sent to the hand writing expert and hence,
it cannot be said to be forged and held the case in industrial dispute in
favour of the petitioner, directing the 2nd respondent company to permit
the petitioner to continue his employment. Aggrieved by the award
passed by the Labour Court, Coimbatore, the 2nd respondent company
had filed a writ petition in W.P.No.7781 of 2003 before this Court.
Pending the writ petition, the 2nd respondent had filed a petition in
W.M.P.No.10000 of 2003 prayed for stay of the operation of the award
dated 11.03.2002. The learned Single Judge, on 12.03.2003 had granted
an order of stay directing the 2nd respondent company herein to deposit
the entire backwages to the petitioner. Challenging the order of stay, the
2nd respondent company had preferred an appeal in W.A.No.1666 of
2003 and this Court, by order, dated 24.08.2006 confirmed the order of
the learned single Judge and hence, it attained finality.
6.He further submitted that this Court, on 23.12.2009 had
dismissed the writ petition in W.P.No.7781 of 2003, holding that the
burden of proof was cast upon the person, who relies upon the said
document.        In this case, the Labour Court, Coimbatore gave cogent
reasons elaborately as to why the theory of resignation could not be
accepted by it in paragraph Nos.10, 12, 13, 14 and 16 and further
observed that it is the duty of the 2nd respondent company to send the
alleged resignation letter to hand writing expert to confirm the signature
found in Ex.M3 is that of the petitioner, which they failed to do so and
held the case in favour of the petitioner. Thereafter, the petitioner had
filed a petition in C.P.No.52 of 2010 seeking arrears of his wages and to
comply with the earlier order of the Labour Court, Coimbatore. In the
meanwhile, the 2nd respondent company had filed Interlocutory
Application in I.A.No.287 of 2015 in C.P.No.52 of 2010 under Section
11(3) of the Industrial Disputes Act r/w Section 45 of the Evidence Act
and 151 of C.P.C., to pass an order to send the documents to the Forensic
Lab and the same was dismissed by order, dated 01.06.2015, wherein, it
was observed as follows:-
“The writ petition filed by the petitioner against the
award is dismissed by the Hon'ble High Court of Madras
on 23.12.2009. The copy of the order marked as Ex.W8.
Since the M.w.1 has admitted that the memo of
understanding was filed before the Hon'ble High Court,
Madras in Writ Appeal in W.A.No.1666/2003 and he had
agreed    to  provide    employment      with   effect     from
01.11.2003 as per Ex.W15, it is not necessary to send
those documents prior to the period of 01.11.2003 to the
handwriting expert for comparison. The Hon'ble High
Court also has arrived back wages of Rs.1,80,000/- while
passing an order Ex.W.7 dated 24.08.2006. Therefore, the
relief sought by the petitioner/respondent is unnecessary
and unwarranted and he is not entitled to the relief as
prayed for. Thus, this point is answered.”
7.The learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that C.P.No.52
of 2010 had ended in his favour, against which, the 2 nd respondent had
filed a Writ Petition in W.P.No.150 of 2022 and the same is pending.
The 2nd respondent company had also filed Crl.O.P.No.1 of 2012 under
Section 340 r/w 195(i)(b) of Cr.P.C., before the Labour Court,
Coimbatore. The Labour Court, Coimbatore, by order, dated 24.07.2017
dismissed the petition, against which, the 2nd respondent company did not
prefer any appeal. On the contrary, he managed to re-open the criminal
case and proceed against the petitioner.
8.The learned counsel for the petitioner further submitted that the
1st respondent Police had closed the case as Mistake of Fact and served
the notice in R.C.S.No.230 of 2004 on 17.06.2004 and filed the closure
report before the trial Court. As stated above, the proceedings before the
Labour Court, Coimbatore as well as before this Court were agitated by
the 2nd respondent company and all the cases ended in favour of the
petitioner. After lapse of 11 years, the charge sheet was filed by the 1 st
respondent Police in this case. More so, the case was reopened and no
notice was served to the petitioner while reopening the case. It is settled
preposition that if any adverse order is being passed on the further
investigation, notice to the issued to the person who is affected and
thereafter hearing his objections, the trial Court to take the case on file.
In this case, after lapse of 11 years, how come charge sheet has been filed
is not known. The specific case of the petitioner is that the petitioner has
not written his resignation letter nor affixes his signature in the same.
The 2nd respondent had filed W.P.No.150 of 2022 seeking quashing of
the order passed in C.P.No.52 of 2010, dated 02.11.2021. This is the
only petition which is pending now, that too, with regard to bonus
granted by the Labour Court, Coimbatore in favour of the petitioner.
9.He further submitted that the 2nd respondent company earlier
filed petitions before the Labour Court, Coimbatore to send the
resignation letter, which is in dispute, to Forensic Department and the
same were dismissed. He further submitted that in the year 2004, the FIR
registered against the petitioner in Crime No.166 of 2003 was closed as
Mistake of Fact for the reason that the alleged forged resignation letter
was not produced and served the notice in R.C.S.No.230 of 2004, dated
17.06.2004 to the 2nd respondent company. Thereafter, in the year 2006,
the trial Court destroyed the records in Crime No.166 of 2003. After
termination of the proceedings before the Labour Court, Coimbatore as
well as before this Court, the original resignation letter was obtained
from the Labour Court, Coimbatore and the 2nd respondent company filed
a petition for further investigation under Section 173(8) Cr.P.C., on
17.11.2012 in C.M.P.No.908 of 2013 in Crime No.166 of 2003 before
the trial Court. At that time, the 2nd respondent company was informed
about the destruction of case records, hence, he filed a petition in
C.M.P.No.899 of 2013 for reconstruction of the case records in Crime
No.166 of 2003. The trial Court, by order, dated 06.02.2013 ordered
reconstruction of destroyed records and for further investigation in Crime
No.166 of 2003.       Thereafter, reconstruction was done and further
investigation was conducted by the 1st respondent Police. He further
submitted        that  the    Deputy      Superintendent       of      Police,
Periyanaickenpalayam seems to be more interest and loyal to the 2nd
respondent company, without any judicial order, he sent the documents
for forensic study and based on the forensic report, the charge sheet was
filed by the 1st respondent Police. While that being so, the trial Court
ought not to have taken cognizance of the case. Hence, he prayed for
quashing of the proceedings against the petitioner.
10.The learned counsel for the petitioner relied on the decision of
the Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of “Chinnathambi @ Subramani
Versus State, rep. by the Inspector of Police, Vellakovil Police Station,
Tirupur District reported in 2017 (2) CTC 241” wherein certain
guidelines were given by this Court, which have not been followed in
this case.
11.The learned counsel for the 2nd respondent company submitted
that after termination of the proceedings before the Labour Court,
Coimbatore, the 2nd respondent company obtained the original
resignation letter of the petitioner, dated 29.07.1998.               He further
submitted that initially, the case in Crime No.166 of 2003 was closed as
Mistake of Fact for the reason that the original resignation letter could
not be produced during investigation.            After obtaining the original
resignation letter, the 2nd respondent company approached the trial Court
and he was informed that the case records in Crime No.166 of 2003 was
destroyed in the year 2006 itself. Hence, the 2 nd respondent company
filed a petition for reconstruction in C.M.P.No.899 of 2013 and produced
the copy of the complaint, FIR in Crime No.166 of 2003 and the trial
Court, by order, dated 06.02.2013 ordered reconstruction of destroyed
records. The 2nd respondent also filed a petition under Section 173(8)
Cr.P.C., for further investigation in Crime No.166 of 2003, since the
original resignation letter, dated 29.07.1998 was obtained.            The trial
Court, by order, dated 06.02.2013 ordered further investigation in Crime
No.166 of 2003.       During further investigation, it was conclusively
proved and confirmed by the Forensic Department that the signature in
the resignation letter is that of the petitioner. The contention of the
petitioner that the signature in his resignation letter is a forged one,
cannot absolve him from the case. From the year 1998, the petitioner had
been filing petitions before the Labour Court, Coimbatore as well as
before this Court and obtained orders in his favour suppressing the true
facts. Now, the Forensic Department confirmed that the signature found
in the resignation letter is that of the petitioner. In the larger interest of
justice, the trial Court considering the submissions of the 2nd respondent
company accepted the further investigation petition and directed the 1st
respondent Police to conduct further investigation, by order, dated
12.He further submitted that the investigation was conduced in a
proper manner after obtaining appropriate orders from the trial Court,
which cannot be questioned by the petitioner. Hence, he prayed for
dismissal of the Quash Petition.
13.The learned Additional Public Prosecutor appearing for the 1st
respondent Police produced the Case Diary and made his submissions
that since the disputed resignation letter, dated 29.07.1998 was not
available and only photostat copy was available, the Assistant Director,
Document Division, Forensic Department returned the photostat copy of
the resignation letter without examination, hence, the FIR was closed as
Mistake of Fact and notice in R.C.S.No.230 of 2004 was served on the
2nd respondent company. After prolonged litigation before the Labour
Court, Coimbatore, finally, the 2nd respondent obtained the original
resignation letter and submitted the same before the trial Court and filed
a petition for further investigation under Section 173(8) Cr.P.C., in
C.M.P.No.908 of 2013. At that time, the trial Court was informed that in
the year 2006, the entire records in Crime No.166 of 2003 were
destroyed. Hence, the 2nd respondent company also filed a petition in
C.M.P.No.899 of 2013 for reconstruction of case records in Crime
No.166 of 2003. Both the petitions were allowed by the trial Court on
06.02.2013 and direction was given to the 1st respondent Police to
conduct further investigation, hence, the further investigation was
conducted and the 2nd respondent and other witnesses were examined,
documents collected. Based on the forensic report and the statement of
the witnesses, charge sheet was filed in this case.
14.He further submitted that the 1st respondent Police only acted
on the directions of the trial Court in conducting further investigation in
this case. As regards the labour dispute between the petitioner and the
2nd respondent company is concerned, the 1st respondent Police is not
concerned about the same. Hence, he prayed for dismissal of the quash
petition.
15.This Court considered the rival submissions and perused the
materials available on record.
16.It is seen that there was a long battle between the petitioner and
the 2nd respondent.           The crux of the issue is that according to the
petitioner, the resignation letter, dated 29.07.1998, is a forged.
Thereafter, there have been several litigations before this Court as well as
before the Labour Court, Coimbatore.
17.The contention of the learned counsel for the petitioner is that
the petitioner used to sign his signature without any underline. In the
resignation letter, there is underline, hence, he claims that the signature
in the resignation letter is forged. In the year 2003, the 2 nd respondent
company obtained direction under Section 156(3) Cr.P.C., from the trial
Court, as per the direction, the 1st respondent Police registered FIR in
Crime No.166 of 2003 against the petitioner, thereafter, the case was
closed as Mistake of Fact in R.C.S.No.230 of 2004 on 17.06.2004. In the
year 2006, the case records in Crime No.166 of 2003 were destroyed.
This being the case, suddenly in the year 2013, the 2nd respondent filed a
petition before the trial Court for reconstruction in C.M.P.No.899 of
2013 and for further investigation claiming that he obtained the original
resignation letter from the Labour Court. Strangely, in both the petitions,
the 1st respondent Police is not shown as party. The trial Court, by order,
dated 06.02.2013 directed the 1st respondent Police to conduct further
investigation in Crime No.166 of 2003.
18.On perusal of the case diary, it is seen that there is a
proceedings, dated 03.02.2014 in Na.Ka.No.10/Memo/SDOPNP/2014 of
the Deputy Superintendent of Police, Periyanaickenpalayam, Sub
Division, Coimbatore District, who directed the Inspector of Police
Periyanaickenpalayam that the 2nd respondent approached this Court and
obtained order to register a case and conduct investigation against the
petitioner. The Deputy Superintendent of Police, Periyanaickenpalayam,
Sub Division, Coimbatore District sent the above proceedings to the 1st
respondent Police along with the copy of the 2nd respondent's complaint,
salary documents containing his signature, the petitioner's resignation
letter, his leave letter and the report of the Forensic Department. Further,
in the Case Diary, there is a receipt of Forensic Department in
No.0592574, dated 27.11.2012 acknowledging the receipt of Rs.1,500/-
and the document submitted for forensic examination has been assigned
as document No.25 of 2012. The report of the Forensic Department,
dated 09.04.2012 is addressed to the Deputy Superintendent of Police,
acknowledged the receipt of documents through Grade-I Police
Constable No.1900 Tr.V.Sreenivasan, which was without any seal.
There have been 16 documents S1 to S16 and one questioned document
were examined. The questioned document is the resignation letter, dated
29.07.1998. On verification of S1 to S16, it is found that in all the
sixteen documents, there is no underline after the signature of the
petitioner except S8, a letter, dated 25.03.1995 and S15, a leave
permission slip, dated 12.07.2003. In the Forensic Report, there is no
mention with regard to comparison of underline, which is the crux of the
issue in this case.
19.It is strange to see under what authority, the Deputy
Superintendent        of   Police, Periyanaickenpalayam    Sub       Division,
Coimbatore sent the documents for forensic examination is not known.
It is seen that the 2nd respondent filed a petition for reconstruction and
further investigation on 17.11.2012 and the orders were passed only on
06.02.2013 and the order was communicated to the concerned Police
only on 19.06.2014. It is also to be seen that the Deputy Superintendent
of Police, Periyanaickenpalayam had paid the fee for Rs.1,500/- for
examination of the documents, which is not a usual procedure. Thus,
even before reconstruction and further investigation, how the Deputy
Superintendent of Police conducted preliminary investigation is not
known.          Admittedly, no specimen signature of the petitioner was
obtained. Thus, from the Forensic Report, no case could be made out
against the petitioner, since no study was made on the underline of the
signature.
20.From the statement of the witnesses annexed in the final report,
it is seen that LW1 to LW5 are from the 2 nd respondent company, LW6 is
the Scientific Officer, LW7 is the Deputy Superintendent of Police and
LW8 is the Inspector of Police. Already, the 2nd respondent company
filed petition before the Labour Court, Coimbatore to send the documents
for forensic study, which was rejected. Suppressing the same, the 2 nd
respondent company managed through the Deputy Superintendent of
Police, Periyanaickenpalayam for forensic study, which is not proper.
The report of the Forensic Department is also not a complete document.
The act of the Deputy Superintendent of Police, Periyanaickenpalayam is
not in the manner known to law. Thus, the entire further investigation is
tainted and coloured one. The trial Court ought to have seen the manner
in which the Deputy Superintendent of Police, Periyanaickenpalayam
Sub Division, Coimbatore had conducted investigation/enquiry in Crime
No.166 of 2003, when the case has already been closed as Mistake of
Fact. Only on the direction of the Deputy Superintendent of Police,
Periyanaickenpalayam Sub Division, Coimbatore, the 2nd respondent
filed a petition under Section 173(8) Cr.P.C., in C.M.P.No.908 of 2013 to
get authenticated. Thus, the act of the Deputy Superintendent of Police,
Periyanaickenpalayam Sub Division, Coimbatore is not acceptable and it
is abuse of process of law. Earlier, the 2nd respondent filed petition
before the Labout Court seeking identical relief, which was negatived.
Thereafter, the present cause of action initiated, which is not acceptable,
proper and that cannot be approved.
21.In view of the above, the proceedings in C.C.No.61 of 2015, on
the file of the Judicial Magistrate Court No.VI, Coimbatore, is hereby
quashed.          Accordingly, this Criminal Original Petition is allowed.
Consequently, the connected Criminal Miscellaneous Petitions are
closed.
