6.   1.      Mr. Palit, learned senior advocate appears on behalf of
petitioner and submits, impugned is order dated 7th February, 2020,
whereby, inter alia, his client’s application for deleting it as party in
the arbitration reference, was disposed of by the arbitrator on deferring
the adjudication. His client, before seeking admission of the writ
petition by direction of issuance of notice, had filed application for
amendment to include in the challenge, orders dated 7th February,
2019 and 20th April, 2022 passed by the arbitral tribunal.
2.      He submits, his client was facilitator in the sale evidenced by
agreement dated 20th June, 2004. There was specific clause in the
agreement excluding his client from being in any way involved in the
transaction. He relies on sub-clause 7.1 under representations and
warranties clause-7. The clause is reproduced below.
“The purchaser acknowledges it has not entered
representation or warranty, whether of fact or
opinion or otherwise, relating to the subject matter
of this Agreement or, without limitation, in reliance
upon any information, warranty, statement or
silence on the part of the DPE, the Seller, or any
officer, employee, agent or adviser of the Registrar,
DPE or the Seller other than representations or
warranties expressly provided in this Agreement.
Unless required by statute or expressly provided in
this Agreement, all representations, warranties and
conditions,   express   or    implied,     statutory   or
otherwise, in respect of the Assets and Business are
expressly excluded. The Purchaser agrees that the
exclusion of representations and warranties as
provided here is reasonable.”
He submits further, astronomical claims have been made in the
reference. Being in no way connected, his client faces peril of having
award made against it on being compelled to be party to the reference.
The Tribunal failed to appreciate that his client is not a signatory to the
agreement through any of its functionaries. In the circumstances, in
event award is made against his client, to challenge his client will have
to put in security. As such, this becomes rarest of rare case, wherein
judicial review in the arbitration reference is required. Mr. Palit wants
to submit on other contentions but this Court felt, they were irrelevant
regarding the question of maintainability of the writ petition.
3.      On perusal of impugned order dated 7th February, 2020, it
appears petitioner had earlier made similar application, disposed of by
order dated 7th February, 2019 observing that whether petitioner is
necessary party to the reference being mixed question of fact and law,
it could not be adjudicated at that stage and would be taken up with the
merit of the claim, while passing award. Petitioner appears to have
accepted said order, at least for while, after which this writ petition
challenging the refusal on its second attempt at having its name struck
out as a party in the reference. On query from Court Mr. Palit submits,
his client did not prefer Special Leave Petition against order dated 7th
February, 2019 passed by the arbitral Tribunal.
4.      The agreement provides for exclusion of representations and
warranties. There are recitals in connection with or in relation to
representations or warranties in mentioning Government of Odisha as
substantial share holder in the seller and having had acted through
Registrar of Cooperative Societies. Department of Public Enterprises
in the Government of Odisha has also been mentioned. Court has not
made further scrutiny of the agreement but is convinced that in event
there is a breach of any of the clauses therein regarding involvement or
exclusion of Government of Odisha, the allegation of breach must be
adjudicated upon in the reference since it has been made a party
thereto.
5.      In circumstances aforesaid the writ petition does not reveal
rarest of rare case requiring intervention by judicial review in a
pending arbitration reference. That is the requirement of law declared
by the Supreme Court in judgment dated 6th January, 2021 in Civil
Appeal no.14665 of 2015 Bhaven Construction v. Executive
6.      The writ petition is dismissed.
