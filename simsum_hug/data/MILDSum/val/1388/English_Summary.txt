In a relief for former Jet Airways Chairman Naresh Goyal and his wife Anita, the Bombay High Court has quashed the Enforcement Directorate (ED)'s ECIR against them.
The division bench comprising Justices Revati Mohite Dere and Prithviraj Chavan passed the order on a petition filed by the duo seeking quashing of the ECIR registered against them under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA). Senior Advocates Ravi Kadam and Aabad Ponda appearing for the petitioners had submitted that there was no predicate offence as required, for the ED to investigate the ECIR. The complaint lodged with the MRA Marg Police Station, Mumbai has resulted in filing of a 'C' Summary Report by the police, they said.

The counsels further submitted that even the protest petition filed by ED was rejected and the order was confirmed by the High Court as well as the Supreme Court. Therefore, the ECIR would have to be quashed, they said.
The counsels cited the Supreme Court judgements in Parvathi Kollur & Anr. vs. State by Directorate of Enforcement
 and Vijay Madanlal Choudhary & Ors. vs. Union of India & Ors

 to pray for quashing of the PMLA case.
On Thursday, ED's counsel Shreeram Shirsaat said that in view of the judgment, nothing was left to argue.
He however said that it may not be recorded as his statement and the court may pass appropriate orders.
