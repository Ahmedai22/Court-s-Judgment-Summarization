1.               Heard learned counsel for the parties in both the petitions.
wp.4037&4038.2022.doc
2.                 Rule.       Rule is made returnable forthwith, in both the
aforesaid petitions, with the consent of the parties and is taken up for
final disposal. Mr. Shirsat waives notice on behalf of the respondent
No.1 – ED and the learned A.P.P waives notice on behalf of the
respondent No.2–State in both the petitions.
3.               By these petitions, preferred under Article 226 of the
Constitution of India and under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal
Procedure,           the petitioner in both the petitions seek identical
substantive relief, which reads thus;
(a) issue a writ of certiorari or a writ in the nature of
certiorari or any other appropriate writ, order or
direction under Article 226 of the Constitution of India,
1950, calling the records of the Respondent No.1
pertaining to the ECIR/MBZO-II/01/2020 dated
20.02.2020 (“Impugned ECIR”) (Exhibit A) and quash
and / or set aside the ECIR/MBZO-II/01/2020 dated
20.02.2020 (“Impugned ECIR”) (Exhibit A), the
investigation carried thereunder and all proceedings and
actions emanating therefrom against the Petitioner, as
being illegal and contrary to law.”
4.               Learned senior counsel for the petitioner in both the
petitions submit that the ECIR registered by the respondent No.1 –
The Directorate of Enforcement (“ED”) does not survive, inasmuch as,
there is no scheduled offence, which is a condition precedent for
initiating ED proceeding.          In support of their submission, learned
senior counsel relied on the following judgments: -
(i)     Harish Fabiani and Others v/s Enforcement Directorate and
(ii)      Criminal Appeal No.1269 of 2017 (Directorate of Enforcement
v/s M/s. Obulapuram Mining Company Pvt. Ltd. and other connected
appeals) decided on 02.12.2022.
5.               Mr. Shirsat, learned counsel for the respondent No.1 – ED
does not dispute the fact that there is no scheduled offence pending
against either of the petitioners. He also does not dispute the fact that
registration of a scheduled offence is a condition precedent for
initiating ED proceeding. He, however submits that it is well possible,
that there may be other cases against the petitioner in both the
petitions, which may be registered against the petitioners. He submits
that in the investigation carried out by the ED, the ED has unearthed
certain irregularities in the forensic audit accounting conducted by
them and as such it is well possible to keep the ECIR registered by the
respondent No.1 – ED, alive.
6.               Perused the papers. A few facts as are necessary to decide
the aforesaid petitions are set out hereinunder :-
Admittedly, the petitioner in Writ Petition No.4037 of
2022 is the husband of the petitioner in Writ Petition No.4038 of
2022.       It appears that Akbar Travels India Private Limited (‘Akbar
Travels’) had filed a private complaint in the Court of the learned
Metropolitan Magistrate, Ballard Pier, Mumbai, against Jet Airways
(India) Limited (‘Jet Airways’) and its erstwhile non-executive directors
i.e. the petitioner in both the petitions, alleging offences punishable
under Sections 120B r/w 406, 420, 467, 468, 471 and 471-A of the
Indian Penal Code (‘IPC’). Vide order dated 15th February 2020, the
wp.4037&4038.2022.doc
trial Court passed an order under Section 156(3) of the Code of
Criminal Procedure (‘Cr.P.C’) and directed the Senior Police Inspector
of the MRA Marg Police Station, Mumbai, to register an FIR as against
the petitioner in both the petitions. Pursuant thereto, on 18th February
2020, an FIR bearing C.R. No.66 of 2020 was registered by the said
police station against Jet Airways and the petitioner in both the
petitions, alleging offences punishable under Sections 406, 420, 465,
467, 468, 471 r/w 120B of the IPC.
It appears that on 20th February 2020, based on the
aforesaid         FIR,       the respondent No.1      –     ED        registered
ECIR/MBZO-II/01/2020 under Sections 3 and 4 of the Prevention of
Money Laundering Act (PMLA), (as the aforesaid offences specified in
the FIR were scheduled offences under paragraph 1 of Part A of the
Schedule to PMLA), against Jet Airways and the petitioner in both the
petitions.
Admittedly on 9th March 2020, a closure report was filed
by the police of the MRA Marg Police Station, Mumbai in the trial
Court. It was recorded in the closure report that the dispute was civil
wp.4037&4038.2022.doc
in nature; that the matter concerned, dues payabe to Akbar Travels by
Jet Airways, and, that the claim in respect thereof, had already been
filed by Akbar Travels with the resolution professional of Jet Airways
in the insolvency proceedings initiated under the provisions of
Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016.
On 15th June 2020, the respondent No.1 – ED filed an
Intervention Application as well as a Protest Petition challenging the
closure report filed by the police, in the trial Court. The original
complainant i.e. Akbar Travels also filed a separate protest petition on
16th June 2020, challenging the said closure report. The trial Court
rejected the intervention application/protest petition filed by the
respondent No.1 – ED, vide order dated 19 th September 2020, after
observing that the respondent No.1 had no locus to intervene
especially when the informant (original complainant) had appeared in
the matter.
Being aggrieved by the said order dated 19 th September
2020, the respondent No.1 – ED               filed a Criminal Revision
Application, being Criminal Revision Application No.400 of 2020 in
wp.4037&4038.2022.doc
the Sessions Court. The Sessions Court vide order dated 15 th October
2020 dismissed the said Criminal Revision Application, observing that
the respondent No.1 – ED had no locus to intervene.
Thereafter, the respondent No.1 – ED challenged the
Sessions Court’s order dated 15 th October 2020 in this Court by filing
Criminal Writ Petition (Stamp) No.3122 of 2020. This Court whilst
dismissing the said writ petition vide order dated 21 st December 2020
observed that there was no provision of law which supported the claim
of the ED, with respect to its locus to intervene and contest the closure
report.
Pursuant thereto, the respondent No.1 – ED filed a Special
Leave Petition being Special Leave Petition (Criminal) No.5524 of
2021 (“SLP”) in the Apex Court, challenging the order passed by this
Court dated 21st December 2020. The Apex Court vide order dated
26th September 2022, dismissed the said SLP.
It appears that in the interregnum, the trial Court vide
order dated 22nd December 2020 accepted the ‘C’ Summary Report
and rejected the orginal complainant’s complaint i.e. of Akbar Travels,
wp.4037&4038.2022.doc
as also the protest petition filed by the original complainant.
The original complainant i.e. Akbar Travels challenged the
said order dated 22nd December 2020 in the Sessions Court and the
Sessions Court vide order dated 6th August 2021, dismissed the said
Criminal Revision Application, after observing that the order of the
trial Court does not suffer from any illegality, impropriety or
incorrectness and as such confirmed the trial Court’s order, accepting
the ‘C’ Summary Report. Admittedly, the said order has attained
finality, inasmuch as, the same has not been challenged, by the original
complainant i.e. Akbar Travels.
7.               Thus, a perusal of the aforesaid facts clearly show that the
order dated 22nd December 2020, passed by the trial Court, accepting
the ‘C’ Summary Report and consequently, dismissing the private
complaint has attained finality. As noted earlier, the said order dated
22nd December 2020 was challenged before the Sessions Court,
however, the Sessions Court vide order dated 6th August 2021
confirmed the order passed by the trial Court and as such dismissed
wp.4037&4038.2022.doc
the Criminal Revision Application filed by the original complainant.
Again, as noted above, there is no challenge to the said order. Thus,
the FIR registered as against the petitioner in both the petitions, stands
closed, in view of the order passed by the trial Court accepting the
closure report, filed by the police and dismissal of the protest petition
filed by the original complainant, and with the Sessions Court
confirming the said order. The fact, that the said order has attained
finality is not in dispute.
8.               Admittedly, the respondent No.1 – ED had registered the
ECIR in question, pursuant to the registration of an FIR i.e. scheduled
offence/predicate offence, which predicate offence now stands closed.
9.               It is well settled by a catena of judgments including the
latest judgment of the Apex Court in Vijay Madanlal Choudhary and
Others v/s Union of India and Others2, that only if there is a predicate
offence, that an ECIR will be maintainable. Thus, if the FIR stands
closed, by a judicial process, the ECIR will not survive. Thus, the
natural corollary would be that the respondent No.1 – ED would not
be able to continue with the investigation, there being no predicate
offence.
10.              This Court in the case of State of Maharashtra v/s Bhimrao
Vithal Jadhav, decided on 21.09.1974 had observed that granting of
‘C’ Summary amounts to an acquittal. Similarly, in Vijay Madanlal
Choudhary (Supra), the Apex Court had observed that if a person is
discharged or acquitted of a scheduled offence by a competent Court,
there can be no offence of money laundering against him.                            The
relevant paragraph, reads thus:-
“253. Tersely put, it is only such property which is derived
or obtained, directly or indirectly, as a result of criminal activity
relating to a scheduled offence can be regarded as proceeds of
crime. The authorities under the 2002 Act cannot resort to
action against any person for money-laundering on an
assumption that the property recovered by them must be
proceeds of crime and that a scheduled offence has been
committed, unless the same is registered with the jurisdictional
police or pending inquiry by way of complaint before the
competent forum. For, the expression “derived or obtained” is
indicative of criminal activity relating to a scheduled offence
already accomplished. Similarly, in the event the person named
in the criminal activity relating to a scheduled offence is finally
absolved by a Court of competent jurisdiction owing to an
wp.4037&4038.2022.doc
order of discharge, acquittal or because of quashing of the
criminal case (scheduled offence) against him/her, there can be
no action for money-laundering against such a person or person
claiming through him in relation to the property linked to the
stated scheduled offence. This interpretation alone can be
countenanced on the basis of the provisions of the 2002 Act, in
particular Section 2(1)(u) read with Section 3. Taking any other
view would be rewriting of these provisions and disregarding
the express language of definition clause “proceeds of crime”,
as it obtains as of now.”
11.              Although, the learned counsel for the respondent No.1 –
ED tried to impress upon this Court that the ECIR is a private internal
document and not at par with an FIR, and as such is not required to be
quashed, the said submission was not pressed, when the learned senior
counsel for the petitioner in both the petitions showed a copy of the
order passed by the Apex Court in the case of                M/s. Obulapuram
Mining Company Pvt. Ltd. (supra).           In the said case, the learned
Solicitor General appearing for the appellant – ED made a statement
that since the proceedings before the Court (Apex Court) arose from
an order of attachment and there is acquittal in respect of the
predicate offence, the ED proceeding really would not survive.
wp.4037&4038.2022.doc
12.              The ratio in Vijay Madanlal Choudhary (Supra), has been
relied     upon by the another Bench of the Apex Court in Parvathi
Kollur and Another v/s State by Directorate of Enforcement 3, In the
said case, the Apex Court in paras 7 to 9 has observed as under:-
“7. Learned counsel for the appellants has contended that
the issue as involved in this matter is no more res integra,
particularly for the view taken by a 3-Judge Bench of this Court
in the case of Vijay Madanlal Choudhary & Ors. vs. Union Of
India & Ors. decided on 27.07.2022 where, the consequence of
failure of prosecution for the scheduled offence has been clearly
provided in the following terms:
187. …….(d) The offence under Section 3 of the 2002
Act is dependent on illegal gain of property as a result of
criminal activity relating to a scheduled offence. It is
concerning the process or activity connected with such
property, which constitutes the offence of money-
laundering. The Authorities under the 2002 Act cannot
prosecute any person on notional basis or on the
assumption that a scheduled offence has been committed,
unless it is so registered with the jurisdictional police and/
or pending enquiry/trial including by way of criminal
complaint before the competent forum. If the person is
finally discharged/acquitted of the scheduled offence or
the criminal case against him is quashed by the Court of
competent jurisdiction, there can be no offence of money
laundering against him or any one claiming such property
being the property linked to stated scheduled offence
through him.
3       Cri. Appeal No.1254/2022 (Arising out of S.L.P. (Cri.) No.4258/2021) decided on 16.08.2022
wp.4037&4038.2022.doc
8.          Learned ASG appearing for the respondent, in all
fairness, does not dispute the above position of law declared by
this Court.
9. The result of the discussion aforesaid is that the view as
taken by the Trial Court in this matter had been a justified view
of the matter and the High Court was not right in setting aside
the discharge order despite the fact that the accused No. 1 had
already been acquitted in relation to the scheduled offence and
the present appellants were not accused of any scheduled
offence.”
13.              As noted above, admittedly there is no scheduled offence
as against the petitioner in both the petitions, in view of the closure
report filed by the police, which was accepted by the Courts as stated
aforesaid. There being no predicate offence i.e. scheduled offence, the
impugned ECIR registered by the respondent No.1 – ED will not
survive and as such the said ECIR will have to be quashed and set
aside.
14.                 The       petitions are accordingly      allowed        and       the
ECIR/MBZO-II/01/2020 registered by the respondent No.1 – ED, is
quashed and set-aside against the petitioners, in both the petitions.
wp.4037&4038.2022.doc
15.             Rule is made absolute in the aforesaid terms. Petitions are
disposed of accordingly.
16.              All concerned to act on the authenticated copy of this
judgment.
