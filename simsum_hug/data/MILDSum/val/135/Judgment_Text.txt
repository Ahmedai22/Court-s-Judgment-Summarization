This petition coming on for hearing this day, the
This petition under Section 11(6) of the Arbitration
and Conciliation Act, 1996, (for short ‘the Act’), has been filed
by M/s Backend Bangalore Private Limited, inter alia, praying
for referring the dispute arising between the petitioner and the
respondent-Chief Engineer-cum-Project Director, State Roads
Project,    Himachal      Pradesh      Road       and
Development Corporation Limited (for short ‘HPRIDC’) to
H   arbitration by constitution of an independent Arbitral Tribunal to
be presided over by the Sole Arbitrator.
2.           Facts of the case as averred in the memo of petition
are that the petitioner-Company in the year, 2014, undertook
the works for the HPRIDC for the delivery of project
management software or e-PMS to monitor HPRIDC works.
Arbitration Case No.61 of 2020
Being satisfied with the work, the respondent in the year, 2016,
informed that it was interested in engaging the services of the
petitioner-Company for the Himachal Pradesh Public Works
the works carried out by them.        H
Department (for short ‘HPPWD’) for the purpose of monitoring
In furtherance to the said
decision taken to extend the e-PMS software application to
HPPWD, the respondent in the year, 2018, acting for and on
behalf of the Governor of Himachal Pradesh, awarded the
contract of Development Management Software to the
petitioner-Company. The contract was entered into between
parties    on   11.12.2018       for    a     lump-sum          value       of
Rs.2,85,10,000/- exclusive of taxes. The term of the contract was
for eighteen months ending on 10.06.2020.                    In terms of the
H   contract, the petitioner-Company was to supply a web based
Project Management System or e-PMS software by creating 100
user licenses, totaling a value of Rs.1,68,00,000/- exclusive of
taxes.   The said amount was to be paid by the respondent
percentage-wise in three stages viz; three stages of 50%, 30%
and 20%. The petitioner-Company was required to supply 100
Arbitration Case No.61 of 2020
Mobile applications, Laptops, Cloud Hosting Services, training
services, customization and migration services. As per Clause
3.9 of the contract, the petitioner was to furnish a Performance
Bank Guarantee in favour of the respondent constituting 10% of
the total contract value in favour of the respondent.
Accordingly, the petitioner-Company furnished the Bank
Guarantee for a sum of Rs.24,16,000/- on 22.02.2019.
According       to    the     petitioner-Company,
completed Stage-I of its deliberables, being the development
and activation of the e-PMS software for 100 user licenses,
which required the petitioner to release 50% payment of the
aforesaid amount of Rs.1,68,00,000/-. Thereafter, the petitioner
customized the software as per requirement of HPRIDC and the
H   petitioner-Company had completed data initialization and
held training programmes at all zonal levels by May, 2019, which
further entitled the petitioner-Company to release 30%
payments, leaving only 20% to be paid after completion of one
year of implementation of the e-PMS software, which would
have become payable by January, 2020. Further case of the
Arbitration Case No.61 of 2020
petitioner-Company is that the respondent periodically held
review meetings and acknowledged the progress and
completion of works, yet they defaulted in making payment as
per agreed terms of the contract.
H     The petitioner-Company
raised three invoices. The first one was dated 05.02.2019 for
Rs.99.12 lacs, against which the respondent paid only a sum of
Rs. 50.00 lacs on 23.09.2019. It raised second invoice for a sum
of Rs.3,77,000/- on 02.05.2019 for cloud hosting and training
services, against which the respondent paid only Rs.2,18,000/-.
The petitioner-Company also raised third invoice dated
01.07.2019 for Rs.59.47 Lacs, against which no payment was
made by the respondent.
4.           According to case set up in the memo of the
H   petition, the petitioner-Company, repeatedly followed up with
the respondent for payment of due amount, who continuously
assured them that they would release payment and on these
assurances, the petitioner-Company continued to render work
under the contract including the submission of weekly reports
by e-mail reflecting the implementation of e-PMS software.
Arbitration Case No.61 of 2020
Further case of the petitioner-Company is that respondent in
the month of August, 2019, informed the petitioner-Company
that the HPPWD was interested in further simplifying and
digitizing data recording with respect to public works projects.
The respondent called on the petitioner-Company to develop
a software to replace the manual Measurement Book (MB) by
way of an on-line MB (e-MB) to be utilized by Junior Engineers
working at site levels to enable generation of on-line Running
Since the petitioner-Company agreed to
develop the software as requested, the petitioner-Company
was called upon to develop and demonstrate the prototype of
the software within two months. As the decision was recorded
in the meeting held on 01.08.2019 it was agreed that since the
H   e-MB works was not within the scope of the contract, a revised
contract    would be executed. Pursuant                 to    the above
development,       the    petitioner-Company           developed            the
software by the end of September, 2019. But the respondent
was not responsive to his repeated requests to host the
demonstration. By this time period of one year was completed
Arbitration Case No.61 of 2020
since the implementation of the e-PMS software, which
obligated the respondent to release the remaining 20% of the
contract value. The petitioner-Company then followed up with
the respondent for releasing the pending payment and finally
the respondent called for a meeting on 03.12.2019 to discuss
the implementation of the e-MB software and also to discuss the
release of pending payments. In this meeting, the petitioner –
demonstrated to the respondent and other
Members of HPPWD, about the e-MB project. A decision was
taken in the meeting held on 01.08.2019 that a revised
agreement would be executed incorporating the e-MB
software into the scope of work. The respondent in its meeting
held on 03.12.2019 agreed to pay 100% advance for purchase
H   of the tablets to install the e-MB and also directed to release the
pending payments to the petitioner-Company for the work
already carried out.
5.           The petitioner-Company, on 05.12.2019, submitted a
quotation for two tablets of similar specification to the
respondent. The petitioner-Company on 19.12.2019 sent e-mail
Arbitration Case No.61 of 2020
to the respondent for releasing 100% payment for purchase of
the tablets.     But the respondent then informed that they
required only 73 tablets. The petitioner-Company again sent a
revised invoice by e-mail on 19.12.2019 for 73 tablets. The
petitioner-Company after discussing the specifications and
pricing of tablets proposed to be purchased, again submitted
a revised invoice on 20.01.2020 by post and e-mail. Upon not
receiving any response, the petitioner-Company sent another
e-mail on 20.02.2020 once again attaching the invoice for
purchase of 73 tablets. Thereafter, the respondent on
05.03.2020 instructed the petitioner-Company to issue a revised
invoice citing certain GST issues with the previous invoice. The
petitioner-Company, on the same day, submitted a revised
H   invoice to the respondent and was awaiting for release of
payment to purchase the tablets.           However, the petitioner-
Company was shocked to receive a notice dated 12.05.2020
issued by the respondent under Clause 2.6.1 of the contract for
termination of the agreement, falsely alleging that the
petitioner-Company had failed to execute the complete works
Arbitration Case No.61 of 2020
as agreed in the meeting held on 03.12.2019. The petitioner-
Company was astonished by the allegations made in the notice
of alleged non-completion of works, as the works referred to
therein could not be completed without installation of the e-MB
software in the tablets, which could be possible only on
releasing 100% advance payment for procuring the tablets.
The petitioner-Company had taken necessary steps to
purchase of the tablets by submitting the invoice for 100%
advance as agreed, but the respondent failed to pay for the
same.C    The petitioner-Company sent a detailed reply to the
notice dated 25.05.2020 addressing each of the issues raised by
the respondent. Completely disregarding the reply, the
respondent sent letter dated 26.06.2020 under Clause 2.6.1 of
H   the contract reiterating the allegations made in the previous
notice    and    unilaterally   terminating      the      contract.        The
respondent, thereafter, proceeded arbitrarily to invoke the
performance bank guarantee dated 22.02.2019 and encashed
a sum of Rs.24,16,000/-.
6.           Mr. Diwan Singh Negi, learned counsel for the
Arbitration Case No.61 of 2020
petitioner submitted that petitioner-Company has a claim of
Rs.1.41 crores against the respondent. In view of the breaches
committed by the respondent, the petitioner-Company is also
entitled to recover compensation from them. It is contended
that dispute resolution mechanism under the contract is found
in Clause-8 of the General Conditions of Contract (GCC) read
with Clause 8.2.4 of the Special Conditions of Contract (SCC).
In terms of the said Clauses, all disputes are to be referred to an
On reference, the Adjudicator shall render a
decision within 28 days. Either party aggrieved by the decision
of the Adjudicator, may refer the decision to an Arbitrator within
28 days of the decision rendered by the Adjudicator. Clause
1.1(a) of the GCC provides that the Adjudicator shall be
H   appointed by the petitioner-Company/respondent. However,
the respondent did not consult the petitioner-Company and
went ahead and appointed one Mr. Dharmesh Sharma as the
Adjudicator.      There are no details forthcoming from the
contract either about the qualification or any other details of
Mr. Dharmesh Sharma.             The unilateral decision of the
Arbitration Case No.61 of 2020
respondent to appoint an Adjudicator without consulting the
petitioner-Company is prima-facie contrary to Clause 1.1(a) of
the contract, which specifically provides that the Adjudicator
shall be appointed jointly by the petitioner-Company and the
Clause 8.2.4 of the GCC provides that the
arbitration shall be conducted in accordance with the
arbitration procedure published by the Institution, named in the
SCC, but this Clause is silent on the name of the Institution. On
the other hand, Annexure B-2 to Clause 8.2.4 of the SCC
provides for ‘Remuneration of Arbitration Tribunal Members’
and a detailed break-up of the arbitrator fees. On a conjoint
reading of Clause 8.2.4 of the GCC and Clause 8.2.4 of the SCC
and Annexure B-2 thereof, it would be evident that the same
H   reflect that the respondent had already decided on the name
of Arbitrator. However, the contract is completely vague and
ambiguous as the arbitrator is not named.
7.           Mr. Diwan Singh Negi, learned counsel for the
petitioner-Company          further     argued         that        unilateral
appointment of Adjudicator by the respondent is contrary to
Arbitration Case No.61 of 2020
the law laid down by the Supreme Court in case of Perkins
Eastman Architects DPC and another Versus HSCC (India)
Limited, reported in (2019 SCC online 1517), wherein, it was held
that a party to a dispute cannot appoint an Arbitrator.
Extending the ratio of the said decision, if a party to a dispute
cannot appoint an Arbitrator, such party also cannot appoint
an Adjudicator as well.         It is argued that the petitioner-
Company issued a notice dated 22.07.2020 demanding
payment of outstanding dues of Rs.1.41 crores together with
interest at the rate of 8% per annum. The petitioner-Company
called upon the respondent to compensate the petitioner-
Company for loss of profits, refund the performance bank
guarantee     and     to   compensate       for   costs      incurred        for
H   developing the e-MB software. The petitioner-Company called
upon the respondent to make payments within two weeks on
receipt of the notice, failing which the petitioner-Company
would treat non-compliance as a dispute in view of the law laid
down by the Supreme Court in Perkins Eastman case.                         The
petitioner-Company notified the respondent that though
Arbitration Case No.61 of 2020
Clause 8.2 of the contract provides for reference of disputes to
the Adjudicator, but the said Clause is opposed to principles of
law laid down by the Supreme Court. The petitioner-Company
in its notice proposed the nomination of a Former Judge of this
Court or a former Judge of any other High Court in India as a
In response to the said notice, respondent sent reply
dated 11.08.2020 refusing to concur with the appointment of
the Sole Arbitrator as proposed by the petitioner-Company. The
respondent erroneously stated that the appointment of
arbitrator is pre-mature, as the petitioner-Company had failed
to comply with Clause 8.2.3 of the contract providing reference
of disputes to an Adjudicator, as condition precedent to
H   arbitration. It is argued that this stand of the respondent is
completely baseless, untenable and unsustainable in law, as
appointment of an Adjudicator by respondent cannot be said
to be either impartial or independent. Any such appointment
would result in a challenge to the neutrality, impartiality and
independence of the Adjudicator and hit by Section 12(5) of
Arbitration Case No.61 of 2020
the Arbitration Act.
Thus, while Clause 1.1(a) of the GCC
reflects that the Adjudicator would be appointed by both the
parties and unilateral appointment of Mr. Dharmesh Sharma
never consulted.                      H
has taken away the right of the petitioner-Company, who was
It is, thus, clear that no independent or
impartial decision can be taken by the Adjudicator and there is
a huge possibility of inherent bias on the part of the Adjudicator,
unilaterally appointed by the respondent, being hit by
principles of law laid down in Perkins Eastman case. It is argued
that the entire scheme of a pre-arbitration adjudication is ill
conceived and contrary to the scheme of Arbitration Act. As
per contract, the Adjudicator has to render his decision within
28 days and such decision may be challenged in arbitration.
H   But the contract does not provide the procedure for
adjudication in terms of leading evidence etc. and then
providing for a challenge procedure to arbitration under the
Arbitration Act.     This completely negates the object and
purpose under the Arbitration Act.
9.           The learned counsel for the petitioner-Company
Arbitration Case No.61 of 2020
relying on the judgments of Delhi High Court in Ravindra Kumar
Verma Versus M/s. BPTP & Anr., reported in 2015(147) DRJ 175
and Sarvesh Security Services Pvt. Ltd. Versus Managing
Director, DSIIDC and the connected matter, Arb. P. No.181/2014
and the connected matter, decided on 16.03.2018 and
submitted that the arbitration Clause providing that the dispute
is to be referred firstly to the Adjudicator and then to the
Arbitrator has to be taken as only directory and not mandatory.
The prayer, is therefore, made to appoint the sole arbitrator.
10.   C      The respondent has contested the petition by filing
a detailed reply. It is contended that according to the
respondent as per agreement between the parties for
adjudicating the dispute, the petitioner-Company in the first
H   invoice would be required to approach the Adjudicator
appointed in terms of Clause 8.2.3, Section-II of SCC of the
contract and only if any of the parties express dissatisfaction
with the decision of the Adjudicator, it would be entitled to seek
reference of the matter to arbitration. Therefore, the present
petition, being premature, is not maintainable, as the petitioner-
Arbitration Case No.61 of 2020
Company has not approached the Adjudicator for securing his
decision. It is contended that the petitioner-Company failed to
perform its obligations, compelling the respondent to terminate
the contract.
The assertion of the petitioner-Company that it
had completed data initialization, are not admitted, as the
petitioner-Company could not provide certificates signed by
Zonal Chief Engineers, depicting that it had initiated/
completed the application in their Zones, as required by the
contractual provisions. The petitioner-Company also did not
complete the training programmes as per the contractual
provisions. The petitioner-Company has, thus, failed to perform
its obligations under the contract. Various payments claimed by
the petitioner-Company in different invoices were not found
H   payable, as it failed to perform terms of the conditions of
contract.
11.          It is submitted that even though, the petitioner-
Company submitted weekly reports by e-mail to reflect the
implementation of e-PMS software, but whether these activities
have been initiated or completed, could not be verified from
Arbitration Case No.61 of 2020
the certificates of Zonal Chief Engineers.
The petitioner-
Company never obtained such certificates and the petitioner-
Company was not, thus, entitled to payment as per terms and
conditions of the contract.
While admitting in the Minutes of
the Meeting held on 01.08.2019, it was decided that manual MB
will be replaced with on-line e-MB and running/final bills will be
system generated based on the on-line measurement. It was
never agreed that developing e-MB was not in the scope of
contract and revised contract will be signed for developing e-
MB. In the subsequent meeting held on 03.12.2019, Mr. Gautam
Hegde, MD of the petitioner-Company had accepted that e-
MB is part of scope of their original contract only, they have
withdrawn the variation of Rs.25.00 lacs for implementation of
H   e-MB.     However, the petitioner-Company was unable to
develop e-MB software suitable for the work flow based
automation of HPPWD starting from the Section JEs and
capturing day-to-day activities of various offices of the
Department and to demonstrate the same. It was also agreed
in the meeting conducted on 03.12.2019 by the petitioner-
Arbitration Case No.61 of 2020
Company that same module will be demonstrated again on
04.12.2019 and 05.12.2019, but the respondent was not satisfied
with e-MB software developed by the petitioner-Company and
few observations were raised for customization of the software.
The petitioner-Company, however, never customized the e-MB
officers/officials of the HPPWD.
observations      raised       by     the
It is further submitted that as per Memo of Minutes
dated 03.12.2019, all illegal payments were released to the
petitioner-Company, but the petitioner-Company failed to
produce certificate of Zonal Heads about the initiation of the
application.     The respondent, therefore, was compelled to
invoke Clause 2.6.1 of the contract and issued notice of
H   termination of contract. It is argued that in the first instance the
dispute is to be referred to the Adjudicator in terms of Clause
8.2.3 of the contract and decision of the Adjudicator is a
condition precedent to arbitration.         The petitioner-Company
had signed the contract containing the name of Mr. Dharmesh
Sharma to act as an Adjudicator and, therefore, it is wrong to
Arbitration Case No.61 of 2020
suggest that he did not consent for his appointment.
submitted that while the Adjudicator is named in Clause 1.1(a)
and 8.2.3 of the SCC, the arbitrator is not named. The law relied
Section    12(5)   of   the   Act      H
upon by the petitioner-Company in Perkins Eastman case and
only    prohibits       the     unilateral
appointment of an arbitrator by one party to the dispute, but
does not prohibit the requirement of a decision by an
Adjudicator, named in the contract, as a condition precedent
to the appointment of Arbitrator. It is denied that the Disputes
Redressal Mechanism provided in the contract is contrary to the
scheme of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act. It is also denied
that adjudication would be acting with bias and would not
render independent and impartial decision as alleged by the
H   petitioner-Company. The petitioner-Company failed to respond
to the notice, issued to him on 12.05.2020 under Clause 2.6.1 of
the GCC, for termination of the contract and failed to explain
as to the action could not be taken within fifteen days for
implementation,         who   was        responsible       for     delay        in
implementation of web based application for establishment of

from the date of notice.           of
Mr. J.S. Bhogal, learned Senior Advocate for the
respondent has relied on the judgment of this Court in Arb. Case
No.51/2010, titled as M/s K.C. Sharma Versus The State of H.P.
and others, decided on 29.09.2011 and argued that in that
case, it was held that according to Clause 24.1 of the
agreement, the parties in the first instance were required to
approach the competent authority for settlement of dispute,
subject to review, whose decision shall be final, but each party
thereafter has the right to file the appeal against the decision
of the competent authority to the Standing Empowered
H   Committee, if the amount appealed against is above Rs.1.00
lac. Constitution of Standing Empowered Committee is
provided under Clause 24.3 of the agreement and the
contractor and employer are entitled to present their
respective cases, supported by documents, before the
Standing Empowered Committee. The decision of the Standing
Arbitration Case No.61 of 2020
Empowered Committee has been made binding on the
employer for payment of 5% of the initial contract price and the
contractor can accept and receive payment after signing full
and final settlement of the claims. It is only if the parties are not
satisfied after exhausting such Dispute Redressal System that
they can refer the dispute to the sole arbitration. This Court in
that case set aside the appointment of Superintending
Engineer as the sole arbitrator by requiring the parties to first
take recourse to Clause 24 of the contract agreement entered
into between them and held that the matter can be referred to
arbitrator by exhausting the Redressal Dispute System, provided
under Clause 24 of the contract agreement.
14.          I have given my thoughtful consideration to rival
H   submissions and perused the material on record. The question
that is required to be decided in the present case is whether in
view of the detailed procedure provided for by Clause 8 of the
contract agreement entered into between the parties for
settlement of dispute, the application for appointment of
Arbitrator can be entertained even though the disputes have
Arbitration Case No.61 of 2020
not been first taken to the Adjudicator for his decision. In order
to appreciate the rival submissions, it would be instructive to
reproduce Clause 8 of the contract agreement hereunder:-
”8. Settlement of Disputes
The Parties shall use their best efforts to
settle amicably all disputes rising out of or in
8.2.1ou connection with this Contract or its interpretation.
If any dispute arises between the Employer
rtand the Service Provider in connection with, or
arising out of, the Contract or the provision of the
Services, whether during carrying out the
C          Services or after their completion, the matter
shall be referred to the Adjudicator within 14
ig  h      8.2.2
days of the notification of disagreement of one
party to the other.
The Adjudicator shall give a decision in
writing within 28 days of receipt of a notification
The Adjudicator shall be paid by the hour
at the rate specified in the BDS and SCC,
together with reimbursable expenses of the
types specified in the SCC, and the cost shall
be divided equally between the Employer and
the Service Provider, whatever decision is
reached by the Adjudicator. Either party may
Arbitration Case No.61 of 2020
refer a decision of the Adjudicator to an
Arbitrator within 28 days of the Adjudicator's
written decision. It neither party refers the
dispute to arbitration within the above 28 days,
the Adjudicator's decision will be final and
The arbitration shall be conducted in
ou accordance with the arbitration procedure
published by the institution named and in the
place shown in the SCC.
Should the Adjudicator resign or die, or
should the Employer and the Service Provider
C          agree that the Adjudicator is not functioning in
accordance     with     the   provisions       of    the
ig  h                Contract, a new Adjudicator will be jointly
appointed by the Employer and the Service
Provider. In case of disagreement between the
LED TODA. Employer and the Service Provider,
H                    within 30 days, the Adjudicator shall be
designated    by    the   Appointing         Authority
designated in the SCC at the request of either
party, within 14 days of receipt of such
request.”
15.            It may be at the outset noted that Section 2 of SCC
in Clause 8.2.3 has clearly mentioned the name of the
Arbitration Case No.61 of 2020
Mr. Dharmesh Sharma, as the Adjudicator, copy of which has
been placed on record by the petitioner-Company itself.
Therefore, the argument that the Adjudicator was unilaterally
appointed by the respondent, may not be available to the
petitioner-Company, but the seminal question to be examined
is whether in the facts of the case, when the petitioner-
Company had repeatedly raised the demand of payment of
various claims and the respondent has not only not released
such payments, but also did not invoke the adjudicatory clause,
but served notice for termination of the contract. The petitioner-
Company has responded to the same by sending detailed
reply refuting the assertion made by the respondent and
reiterating his claim. A perusal of the afore-extracted Clause
H   8.2.1 of the contract agreement indicate that if any dispute
arises between the employer and the service provider, the
matter shall be referred to the Adjudicator within fourteen days
of the notice of disagreement of one party to the other. In the
opinion of this Court, either of the parties could have taken the
dispute to the Arbitrator.       The Clause does not necessarily
Arbitration Case No.61 of 2020
require the petitioner-Company alone could approach the
Adjudicator. The respondent as well upon receiving the
repeated communications from the petitioner-Company and
finding reply to the notice of termination of the contract not
acceptable, could have referred the dispute to the Adjudicator
fourteen    days    of   the    notice     of
Disagreement stood notified when the respondent declined to
disagreement.
release the payment as claimed by the petitioner-Company.
Even if, the nomination of Mr. Dharmesh Sharma as Adjudicator,
was not unilaterally made by the respondent, the condition of
referring the dispute first to the Adjudicator, cannot be taken as
a bar for the petitioner-Company to raise the demand for
referring the dispute to the Arbitrator, as in the facts of the case
H   such a Clause can only be taken as directory. Even otherwise,
reference of dispute to the Adjudicator cannot be taken as
condition precedent for making a reference to the Arbitrator,
for two reasons, firstly, that the respondent itself failed to refer
the dispute to the Adjudicator, and secondly, it has strenuously
contested the matter even before this Court, on merits, by filing
Arbitration Case No.61 of 2020
detailed reply to the petition, which has remained pending for
more than 1½ years even if approached the Adjudicator would
be required to give his decision within twenty-eight days of the
reference to him, that phase passed a long time ago. No useful
purpose, would therefore, be served by now relegating the
parties to the remedy of adjudication.
Resources (USA) Limited, reported in (2009) 2 Supreme Court
Cases 55, an application under Section 11(5) and 9 of the
Arbitration Act, was filed before the Supreme Court with the
prayer to appoint an Arbitrator in terms of the relevant Clause
in the agreement entered into between the applicant and the
respondent.      A Memo of Understanding was entered into
H   between the applicant and the respondent with the intention
to make substantial investments to set up an integrated
aluminium complex in Orissa with an alumina refinery to be
catered by the bauxite deposits of Gandhamardan Mines. The
respondent proposed to the applicant to set up said integrated
aluminium complex in the joint venture with the applicant by
Arbitration Case No.61 of 2020
duly incorporating a special purpose vehicle for the purpose.
The applicant relying on the assurance of the respondent had
accepted the proposal for setting up of the said aluminium
complex in joint venture with the respondent and Memo of
Understanding was executed between them, defining their
respective rights and obligations. Clause VI of the agreement
dated 14.02.2005 provided that “Any dispute arising out of this
agreement and which cannot be settled amicably shall be
finally settled in accordance with the Arbitration and
Conciliation    Act,   1996.”    The    respondent        on
addressed a letter to the applicant, inter alia, alleging that
agreement entered into between them was not appropriate,
as it does not address the changes in the OMC draft agreement
H   itself and, therefore, the agreement has been rendered
unworkable. The applicant asserted that the agreement dated
15.02.2005 entered into between them was valid and subsisting,
whereas, the respondent contended that the agreement was
unworkable.      On 25.09.2006, the respondent informed the
applicant that Memo of Understanding dated 14.02.2005 and
Arbitration Case No.61 of 2020
15.02.2005 stand discharged and CRL stands discharged of its
obligations under this agreement. The applicant, vide letter
dated 06.08.2007 informed the respondent that its action of
also the agreement was not acceptable.H
unilaterally terminating the said Memo of Understanding and
The applicant,
therefore, invoked the arbitration Clause duly informing the
respondent that the disputes, thus, having arising out of the said
Memo of Understanding and agreement, are required to be
resolved by the Arbitrator. The respondent, in turn, vide letter
dated 03.04.2007 rejected the names suggested by the
applicant to be appointed as Arbitrator for the reasons that
(a) the arbitration will not be cost-effective; and (b) the
arbitration is premature, because the agreement entered into
H   between the parties provided for resolution of disputes through
conciliation in accordance with the provisions of the Arbitration
Act in case of failure to settle the disputes amicably between
the parties. Rejecting the arguments, in paragraphs 24-26 and
41, the Supreme Court held as under:-
Arbitration Case No.61 of 2020
Be it noted that at no stage the respondent
took any plea that the dispute was required to be
settled through conciliation in accordance with the
Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996. It is evidently
an afterthought. Shri Venugopal submitted that on
a comparison with dispute resolution clause in the
MOU entered into between the OMC and CRL with
the settlement clause in the agreement dated
February 15, 2005, it is apparent that there was no
specific intention of the parties to refer the disputes
to arbitration. It is true that the dispute resolution
clause in MOU entered into between OMC and CRL
C    is more specific in its terms but the said clause would
not throw any light in construing clause VI in the
ig  h         agreement dated 15th February, 2005. One cannot
take into consideration terms of other contracts
especially when the contract is not between the
same parties. Shri Venugopal, relied on that clause
H             and submitted that in the absence of a similar
clause in the present agreement the parties have
made their intention expressly clear to resolve their
disputes through conciliation in case of failure to
settle the disputes amicably among themselves.
25.      The submission is unsustainable for more
than one reason. No party can be allowed to take
advantage of inartistic drafting of arbitration clause
Arbitration Case No.61 of 2020
in any agreement as long as clear intention of
parties to go for arbitration in case of any future
disputes is evident from the agreement and material
on record including surrounding circumstances.
What is required to be gathered is the
intention of the parties from the surrounding
circumstances including the conduct of the parties
correspondence
respondent in none of its letters addressed to the
applicant suggested that the dispute between the
parties is required to be settled through conciliation
C    and not by arbitration. In response to the applicant's
letter invoking the arbitration clause the respondent
ig  h         merely objected to the names inter-alia contending
the suggested arbitration would not be cost
effective and the demand for arbitration itself was
a premature one.
It is amply clear from the facts as pleaded
as   well   as    from       the    exchange
correspondence between the parties that there has
not been any satisfaction recorded by the parties
with respect to their claims. There has been no
mutual satisfaction arrived at between the parties
as regards the dispute in hand. The claims are
obviously not barred by any limitation. It is thus clear
Arbitration Case No.61 of 2020
that there is a live issue subsisting between the
parties requiring its resolution.”               .
The Delhi High Court in M/s Haldiram Manufacturing
Limited, reported in 193 (2012) DLT 410, was dealing with a case
where an application under Section 8 of the Arbitration Act for
reference of dispute to the Arbitrator was dismissed by the Civil
Court on the ground that the applicant failed to comply with
the pre-condition of entering into mutual discussion before
invoking the arbitration Clause. Delhi High Court reversing the
order of the Civil Court held that the defendant in the reply to
the notice served by the plaintiff had neither called upon the
plaintiff for such mutual discussions as envisaged in the relevant
H   Clause of agreement nor had specifically reminded the plaintiff
of the said Clause for adjudication of the disputes through
arbitration. Vide paragraph 16 of the said judgment, it was held
“16.        On a holistic reading of the said arbitration
clause, it is decipherable that the first option given
Arbitration Case No.61 of 2020
by the defendant to the plaintiff is for settlement of
the disputes through mutual discussion and the
option of arbitration would come at the second
stage. The defendant has admittedly not called
upon the plaintiff for any mutual discussion and
therefore, the defendant itself has ignored Clause-
34 of the said application form and having ignored
the said clause itself, this Court does not find the
defendant has any right to move the present
application to seek rejection of the present plaint
based on the alleged arbitration agreement. The
defendant cannot be allowed to rely on the
C    said clause for invoking arbitration proceedings and
at the same time ignore the course of action of
ig  h         `mutual discussion' contrived in the said clause. The
conduct of the defendant clearly is contrary to the
mandate of the said clause and thus the stage to
invoke arbitration proceedings before exhausting
H             the first stage of mutual discussion does not arise.
However, at this stage the defendant cannot be
allowed to take shelter under the said clause for
invoking the arbitration proceedings when it has
retracted from the same. The defendant cannot be
allowed to approbate and reprobate and thus in
the facts of the case at hand is not entitled to relief.”
Arbitration Case No.61 of 2020
In the present case also, the analogy of above
judgments can be applied, because despite service of notice
of arbitration by the petitioner-Company dated 22.07.2020, the
respondent relying on Clause 8.2.3 of the GCC and SCC in its
reply to the notice dated 11.08.2020 instead of referring the
dispute to the Adjudicator in terms of Clause 8.2.3 of the SCC,
rather blamed the petitioner-Company that it failed to refer the
dispute to adjudicator to obtain his decision in terms of the
contract and, therefore, the notice invoking the arbitration
Clause, was pre-mature. As discussed above, the wording of
Clause 8.2.3 of the SCC does not require that it is only the
applicant, who could have referred the dispute to the
Adjudicator, but the respondent could also within fourteen days
H   of the Notification of disagreement, refer the dispute to the
Adjudicator. Rather than doing so, the respondent pre-emted
the issues, by terminating the agreement, when it received the
reply, dated 25.05.2000 sent by the petitioner-Company to the
respondent in response to their notice dated 12.05.2020 to
terminate the agreement. When the respondent did not agree
Arbitration Case No.61 of 2020
with the reply sent by the petitioner-Company, stage of
disagreement      was     complete      and     stood       notified.      The
respondent, could therefore, possibly not be allowed to argue
that after their failure to avail the opportunity to refer the dispute
to the Adjudicator, they would instead exercise the option of
terminating the agreement and now the compulsion would be
for the petitioner-Company to refer the dispute to the
Adjudicator, before praying for appointment of Arbitrator.
Delhi High Court in Saraswati Construction Company
reported in 1995 (57) DLT 343 was dealing with a case where
arbitration Clause could only be invoked in the particular
manner, by calling upon the Architect to refer the dispute to
H   arbitration and since notice was not given through the
Architect, it was argued that the arbitration Clause could not
be invoked.     The High Court held that prior requirement, as
stated in arbitration Clause, even if, not complied with, the
same cannot debar reference of dispute to arbitration,
because such procedure/pre-condition has to be taken as only
Arbitration Case No.61 of 2020
directory and not mandatory requirement.
20.           Similarly, Delhi High Court in Sikand Construction
Co. Versus State Bank of India, reported in ILR (1979) (1) 364 also
held that writing a letter to the Architect is directory provision in
the arbitration Clause and that in the said case, despite no such
letter being written by the party for invoking the arbitration
Clause in the manner contemplated in the arbitration Clause,
still what the Court in view of the arbitration Clause has to
consider is whether the parties have entered into arbitration
agreement and if so, whether there is any sufficient ground for
not referring the dispute to the Arbitrator. If it is proved that
there is an agreement, then the Court has to direct to appoint
the Arbitrator in accordance with arbitration Clause.
H   21.          Delhi High Court, in Ravindra Kumar Verma (supra),
the judgment relied upon by the learned counsel for the
petitioner-Company, in somewhat             similar facts, referred to
Section 77 of the Arbitration Act, which provided that parties
shall not initiate, during the conciliation proceedings, any
arbitral or judicial proceedings in respect of a dispute that is
Arbitration Case No.61 of 2020
subject-matter of the conciliation proceedings except that a
party may initiate arbitral or judicial proceedings where, in his
opinion, such proceedings are necessary for preserving his
rights. It was held that existence of conciliation or mutual
discussion procedure or other similar procedure or for any other
legal proceeding required to be filed for preserving rights of the
parties, cannot be held as a bar to entertain a petition, which is
filed under Sections 11 and 8 of the Act. In Ravindra Kumar
Verma (supra), since the reference was already made to the
Arbitrator by the Civil Court by accepting the application under
Section 8 of the Arbitration Act, the High Court after holding that
such a condition was only directory in nature, required the
parties to engage in mutual discussions within a reasonable
H   period and if the same do not conclude successfully within
three months, the arbitral proceedings should be further
continued.
22.          Delhi High Court in Sarvesh Security Services Pvt. Ltd.
(supra) was dealing with somewhat similar issues, in which
Clause 60 of the agreement provided that any dispute or
Arbitration Case No.61 of 2020
difference arising out or relating to the contract will be resolved
through joint discussion of the authorities and representatives of
the concerned parties and if the disputes are not resolved by
discussion, then the matter shall be referred for adjudication to
the sole Arbitrator. High Court held that even after filing of an
application under Section 11(6) of the Act, the matter is
pending for four years and even till date, the respondent has
not attempted to appoint Arbitrator and they continued to
oppose the application for appointment of Arbitrator and
pleaded that first an attempt should have been made for joint
discussion.     The High Court rejected the argument by
contending that the petitioner invited the respondent for joint
discussion, to which they did not respond. Moreover, the said
H   procedure cannot be said to be mandatory for the purpose of
filing the present application under Section 11 of the Arbitration
Act and, therefore, the respondent failed to perform their
obligation under arbitration Clause of appointing the Arbitrator.
The application was, therefore, allowed.
23.           Rajasthan High Court in M/s JIL-Aquafil (JV) Versus
Arbitration Case No.61 of 2020
Rajasthan Urban Infrastructure Development Project, reported in
2016 SCC OnLine Raj 3814:AIR 2016 (NOC 671) 313 was dealing
with the same issue, where the arbitration Clause in the
agreement between the parties similarly provided that the
dispute shall be first referred to the Project Manager, who has
jurisdiction over the work described in the contract as a
reference, who shall, not later than twenty-eight days after
receipt of the reference, give written notice of his decision to
the employer and the contractor, which shall be final. If either
of the parties is dissatisfied with such decision or if the Project
Manager fails to give notice of decision on or before twenty-
eight days he received reference, either party on or before
twenty-eight days after the day on which it received a notice
H   of such decision, may give notice to the other party, with copy
to the Project Manager of his intention to commence the
arbitration proceedings for settlement of dispute. In that case
also, a show cause notice was served on the petitioner, who
gave reply to the same and, therefore, the Court took the view
that it should be taken substantial compliance of reference of
Arbitration Case No.61 of 2020
dispute to the Project Manager. Instead of acting on the reply
submitted by the respondent, the Project Manager by detailed
order terminated the contract and since the relevant Clause
provided that decision of the Project Manager would be final,
the remedy availed by the petitioner against the decision of the
Project Manager by invoking the arbitration Clause, cannot be
said to be premature held the Court. Vide paragraphs 19 and
20, it was held as under:-
The order of termination of contract has to
C be in the facts of the case taken as decision of Project
Manager in response to the demand raised by the
ig  h      applicant in its reply and that decision did not come
about within 28 days, rather that decision came after
40 days on 23.10.2013.           The decision being of
termination of contract, the applicant contractor, as
H          per conditions of Clause 24.1. was not required to
proceed with remaining work but as per Clause 24.2, if
the Contractor/Applicant was dissatisfied with the
decision of the Project Manager, in either event,
namely, if the Project Manager gives notice of the
decision on or before 28 days after the date on which
he received the reference or if he failed to do so, it was
Arbitration Case No.61 of 2020
free to give notice to the employer of its intention to
commence arbitration for settlement of disputes,
Argument of non-applicant/employer in
the present case is that as per the sub-clause (2) of
Clause 24, if the Contractor has failed to give written
notice to commence arbitration on or before 28 days
after the day on which he received notice as to such
decision, the said decision becomes final and binding
upon him, amounting to waiver of arbitration clause
by the contractor. Then Clause 24.3 comes into play,
which provides that where notice of intention to
commence arbitration has been given in accordance
C with   sub-clause     24.3,    according     to    which
arbitration shall not commence unless an attempt has
ig  h      first been made by the parties to settle the dispute
amicably. It provided that unless the parties otherwise
agree, arbitration, may be commenced on or after
fifty-sixth day, after the day on which the notice of
H          intention to commence arbitration was given, whether
or not any attempt at amicable settlement thereof has
been made, Clause 24,3 thus makes it clear that
requirement of making efforts to settle the disputes
amicably, prior to commencement of arbitration is
optional. Even if such efforts after notice of intention to
commence arbitration are made and fail, remedy of
arbitration is not lost. In fact, Clause 24.4 stipulates that
Arbitration Case No.61 of 2020
if any dispute in respect of which decision of Project
Manager has not become final and binding pursuant
to sub-clause 24.3, and amicable settlement has not
boon reached within the period stated in sub-clause
24.5. dispute shall be finally resolved by the arbitration.
It is on the basis of this clause that learned counsel for
non-applicant would argue that since decision of the
Project Manager has become final and binding
pursuant to sub clause 24.3, the remedy of arbitration
would not be available and dispute cannot be
referred to the arbitration. I am not persuaded to
uphold this argument for reasons to be stated herein
Clittle later.”
In    Rajiv   Vyas   Versus      Johnwin         s/o     George
Manavalan, reported in 2010 6 Mah LJ 483, the Bombay High
Court was also dealing with similar case, wherein, the arbitration
H   clause in the agreement provided for referring the dispute first
to Conciliator and then to the Arbitrator and on that ground,
the application for appointment of Arbitrator filed under Section
11 of the Arbitration Act, was opposed. The High Court allowed
the application and referred the dispute to the Conciliator while
simultaneously constituting Arbitral Tribunal, to which the
Arbitration Case No.61 of 2020
dispute would stand referred, in the event the conciliation
failed. There is no justification for adopting such a course in the
present matter, because herein even though the respondent
had the option of referring the dispute to the Adjudicator after
receiving reply of the petitioner-Company to the show cause
outo   terminate    the     agreement,        they
terminated the agreement. The judgment of this Court in M/s
K.C. Sharma (supra) cited by the petitioner-Company, with
respect, having not noticed any of the important decisions and
law on the subject, cannot be said to be laying down good law
and, therefore, cannot be followed.
25.          In view of the above, the arbitration petition is
allowed.
No.505, Sector 36-B, Chandigarh, is appointed as an Arbitrator,
after his disclosure in writing is obtained in terms of Section 11(8)
of the Act and only after receipt thereof, shall his appointment,
as an Arbitrator, come into force.
27.          On his giving consent to arbitrate the dispute
Arbitration Case No.61 of 2020
between the parties, as an Arbitrator, Justice Rajiv Sharma
(Retd.), shall enter into reference and shall pass an award in
accordance with law. Copy of this order be forwarded to the
learned counsel for the parties, as also to the learned Arbitrator.
The learned Arbitrator so appointed shall be entitled to fee as
per stipulation contained in 4th Schedule appended to the
Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996.
