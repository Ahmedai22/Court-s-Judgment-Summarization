with the consent of the learned counsel appearing for the rival parties.
(2)                By this writ petition, the petitioners (original
plaintiffs) have challenged order dated 01/12/2018, passed at Exh.1
and 24 by the Court of 6th Joint Civil Judge, Senior Division, Nagpur
(hereinafter referred to as the “trial Court”).        Exh.24 was an
application filed by the respondents (original defendants) under
Section 8 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (Act of 1996),
for referring the matter to arbitration by contending that there was an
arbitration agreement between the parties. As a consequence of the
said application being allowed, order was passed on Exh.1 on the same
date, whereby it was observed that in view of the application at Exh.24
being allowed, the suit itself stood disposed of, with the parties to go
for arbitration in terms of the arbitration agreement.
(3)                 It appears that aggrieved by the said orders, passed
by the trial Court, the petitioners filed Regular Civil Appeal No.93 of
2019, before the Court of Principal District Judge, Nagpur. By
judgment and order dated 12/02/2021, the said Court dismissed the
appeal as untenable.      The said judgment and order is also made
subject matter of challenge in the present writ petition.
(4)                 The petitioners filed Special Civil Suit No. 324 of
2017 against the respondents for recovery of a specific amount,
claiming that the respondents while executing a contract and
constructing a warehouse, had used sub-standard material and that in
such circumstances, the petitioners were entitled to specific amount
claimed in the said suit.
(5)                 The respondents filed application under Section
8(1) of the Act of 1996, claiming that there was an arbitration clause/
agreement between the parties, if the purchase order / contract dated
16/07/2012, was to be read with proposal dated 26/06/2012,
forwarded by the respondents. Reliance was placed on Clause (14) in
the proposal, to assert that there was an arbitration clause and that
therefore, the suit ought to be disposed of by directing the parties to go
for arbitration. The said application was marked as Exh.24. As noted
herein above, by the impugned order dated 01/12/2018, the trial
Court allowed the application at Exh.24 and consequently passed
order on the same date on Exh.1, disposing of the suit, leaving the
parties to go to arbitration. The appeal filed against the same failed on
the ground of tenability.
(6)                 Ms. Neelam Biala, learned counsel appearing for the
petitioners submitted that a perusal of the documents on record would
show that there was no arbitration clause in the concluded contract
between the parties.      It was submitted that even if there was an
arbitration clause in the proposal forwarded by the petitioners on
26/06/2012, when the petitioners communicated their response to the
same, by the document dated 12/07/2012, styled as a letter of intent,
the proposal was only referred to and the aforesaid document
specifically laid down the manner in which the respondents would
execute the project for which they were being engaged by the
petitioners. It was submitted that this was the only document signed
on behalf of both the parties and admittedly the said document did not
contain any arbitration clause. Reference was also made to a purchase
order dated 16/07/2012, virtually reiterating the clauses and terms
and conditions stated in the letter of intent, in pursuance of which, the
respondents proceeded to execute the project. On this basis, it was
submitted that the trial Court failed to appreciate the true nature of
the documents executed between the parties and that in the absence of
an arbitration clause / agreement, power under Section 8(1) of the Act
of 1996, was erroneously exercised by the trial Court and therefore,
the suit was also wrongly disposed of. A feeble attempt was made to
claim that the judgment and order passed by the District Court
dismissing the appeal as untenable, deserved to be set aside.
(7)                On the other hand, Mr. Bhanarkar, learned counsel
appearing for the respondents submitted that the case of the
respondents before the Courts below was that the purchase order /
contract dated 16/07/2012, had to be read with proposal dated
26/12/2012 and the two documents read together clearly justified the
impugned order passed by the trial Court referring the parties to
arbitration by exercising power under Section 8(1) of the Act of 1996.
It was submitted that when there was clear reference to the proposal
dated 26/06/2012, in the purchase order dated 16/07/2012, the
clauses of the proposal ought to be read as having been incorporated
in the purchase order for concluding that an arbitration clause/
agreement did exist between the parties. It was submitted that the
appellate Court was justified in dismissing the appeal as untenable and
that therefore, the writ petition itself deserved to be dismissed.
(8)                 Heard learned counsel for the rival parties and
perused the material on record. In order to exercise power under
Section 8 of the Act of 1996, there has to be an arbitration agreement
between the parties. Such an agreement can certainly be a clause in a
document executed between the parties.          In any case, existence of
such a clause or agreement is a sine qua non for the Court to exercise
power under Section 8 of the Act of 1996. Therefore, it needs to be
examined whether the documents on record, upon which the parties
have placed reliance, demonstrate existence of such an arbitration
(9)                 It is the case of the respondents that the purchase
order dated 16/07/2012, read with the proposal dated 26/06/2012,
demonstrates that there was indeed an arbitration clause and that
therefore, the trial Court was justified in exercising power under
Section 8 of the Act of 1996, for referring the parties to arbitration and
in that light disposing of the suit itself.
(10)                This Court has perused the letter dated 26/06/2012,
which forwarded a proposal dated 10/05/2012, from the respondents
to the petitioners. In this document, which is signed unilaterally by
the respondents, there is indeed an arbitration agreement at clause
(14). It appears that in response thereto the petitioners issued a letter
of intent on 12/07/2012, referring to the said letter dated
26/06/2012, as also subsequent discussions and then specifically
stated that the petitioners were pleased to issue the letter of intent to
the respondents for supply of pre-fabricated steel building against the
offer made by the respondents.         It is significant that this letter of
intent, apart from stating the requirements of the prefabricated steel
building in terms of its measurement and the material to be used, also
incorporated certain terms and conditions and there was no reference
at all to any arbitration clause or any kind of agreement between the
parties to refer disputes that may occur in the future for arbitration.
This is the only document signed by the representatives of both the
(11)                Thereafter, on 16/07/2012, the petitioners issued
the purchase order, again referring to the letter dated 26/06/2012,
whereby the respondents had forwarded their proposal, as also to
subsequent discussions and the letter of intent dated 12/07/2012.
This is a document signed only on behalf of the petitioners and in this
document, the specifications regarding the prefabricated steel building
stated in the letter of intent were reiterated and terms and conditions
were again specified which contained various clauses, including a
clause concerning force majeure, but significantly it did not contain
any clause specifying an arbitration agreement between the parties.
(12)                The trial Court accepted the contentions raised on
behalf of the respondents and proceeded on the basis that there was an
arbitration agreement between the parties as stated in clause No. (14)
of the proposal dated 10/05/2012, forwarded by letter dated
26/06/2012 on behalf of the respondents.         Having concluded that
there was an arbitration clause/agreement signed by the parties, the
trial Court proceeded to exercise power under Section 8 of the Act of
1996 and allowed the application, thereby relegating the parties to
arbitration and in that light disposed of the suit itself.
(13)               This Court is of the opinion that the trial Court
committed a grave error in failing to appreciate the true purport of the
documents on record.       For an arbitration agreement to come into
existence between the parties, there ought to be a document executed
on behalf of both the parties, showing consensus ad-idem,
incorporating such an arbitration clause/agreement. The only
document signed on behalf of both the parties is the letter of intent
dated    12/07/2012,     which    admittedly   contains    no     arbitration
clause/agreement.       Similarly, even the purchase order dated
16/07/2012, which is signed only on behalf of the petitioners does not
contain such an arbitration clause. This Court is of the opinion that
merely because the proposal forwarded on behalf of the respondents,
by letter dated 26/06/2012, contained an arbitration clause, which
was unilaterally signed only on behalf of the respondents and there
was reference thereto in the letter of intent dated 12/07/2012 and the
purchase order dated 16/07/2012, it cannot be said that an arbitration
agreement came into existence between the parties.              The only
document i.e. the letter of intent dated 12/07/2012, signed by both
the parties, merely referred to the proposal and specifically and
independently recorded terms and conditions for the execution of the
project by the respondents, which did not contain an arbitration
clause/agreement.       Mere   reference   to the   proposal,       without
incorporation of the arbitration clause/agreement in the letter of intent
dated 12/07/2012 and the purchase order dated 16/07/2012, would
not amount to an arbitration agreement coming into existence. The
trial Court failed to appreciate this aspect of the matter while
exercising power under Section 8 of the Act of 1996.
(14)               In this context, reliance placed by the learned
counsel appearing for the respondents on judgment of the Hon’ble
Supreme Court in the case of Sundaram Finance Limited and another
vs. T. Thankam, (2015) 14 SCC 444, particularly paragraph 8 thereof,
cannot be of any assistance to the respondents, for the reason that in
the said case, the Hon’ble Supreme Court found on facts that there was
indeed an arbitration agreement existing between the parties.
(15)               In view of the above, it becomes clear that the
orders dated 01/12/2018, passed on Exhs.1 and 24 by the trial Court
are unsustainable.
12/02/2021, passed by the District Court is concerned, since this Court
is inclined to allow the present writ petition and set aside the aforesaid
orders of the trial Court, any discussion and findings on the impugned
judgment and order of the District Court is unnecessary and in the
light of the orders of the trial Court being set aside, the occasion to file
the appeal itself would cease to exist. Therefore, this Court is not
inclined to delve upon the contentions raised by the rival parties in the
context of the impugned judgment and order dated 12/02/2021,
passed by the District Court.
(17)                In view of the above, the Writ Petition is allowed.
(18)                The impugned orders dated 01/12/2018, passed by
the trial Court on Exh.1 and 24 are quashed and set aside.                   As a
consequence, the suit filed by the petitioners before the trial Court
stands restored.      The trial Court shall now proceed further in
accordance with law.        As a consequence of setting aside of the
aforesaid orders passed by the trial Court, the judgment and order
dated 12/02/2021, passed by the District Court is rendered
meaningless and, on that ground, it is also set aside. The trial Court to
proceed expeditiously in the matter.
