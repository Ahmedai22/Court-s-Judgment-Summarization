1.  The present appeal has been filed under Section 37(1)(c) of the
Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 read with Section 13 of the
Commercial Courts Act, 2015 challenging the impugned judgment dated
05.01.2022 passed by the learned Single Judge of this Court in O.M.P.
(COMM) 432 of 2019 titled „National Seeds Corporation Ltd. vs.
2.  Briefly stating the facts giving rise to filing of the present appeal are as
2.1 The State of Uttar Pradesh had floated various subsidy schemes such as
scheme for popularization of cultivation of hybrid paddy in the State of
Digitally Signed ByAMIT      FAO(OS) (COMM) 69/2022                                        Page 1 of 21
Uttar Pradesh. Under the schemes, farmers were eligible for distribution
subsidy at the rate of about 50 % of the seed costs and the Appellant
would receive the subsidy amount directly from the State Government.
Under these subsidy schemes, the seeds were to be supplied to the farmer,
where 50% of the cost of seeds was to come from the farmer which was to
be received by the appellant through the dealers (respondent herein) and
the remaining 50% costs of the seed was the subsidy component which
was to be paid for by the State Government. The Appellant had
accordingly entered into agreements with various dealers including the
respondent for implementation of the subsidy schemes.
2.2 The appellant was involved in selling the seeds to the farmers through its
dealers. The beneficiary list of farmers was to be verified by the
concerned Local Agriculture Departmental Authority and then the claim
for subsidy amount was to be submitted to the State Agriculture
Department along with verified beneficiary list for release of subsidy
amount by the State Government to the appellant.
2.3 With this objective in mind, the appellant and the respondent entered into
a Distributorship Agreement dated 24.10.2009, which was renewed by an
Agreement dated 01.04.2010, which has been extended from time to time
on the same terms and conditions.
2.4 As per the agreement, the respondent had agreed to sell certified seeds of
approved varieties with subsidies at the retail price fixed by the appellant
after reducing the admissible amount of subsidy.
2.5 In consideration for the same, the appellant had agreed to provide a trade
discount to the respondent. As per the terms and conditions of the
distributorship agreement, the respondent was also required to sell 25% of
Digitally Signed ByAMIT       FAO(OS) (COMM) 69/2022                                     Page 2 of 21
the oil seeds and pulses and 30% of the wheat certified seeds to farmers
from SC/ST category. In terms of its obligation contained in Clause 11 of
the agreement, the respondent was obliged to collect all records, cash
memos, registers and subsidized sale details in the approved format and
submit the same to the Regional Office of the appellant after verification
from the appropriate authority of the Agriculture Department.
2.6 The respondent submitted that it had complied with all its obligations
under the agreement and had sold the seeds obtained from the appellant at
the discounted price. Accordingly, it claimed that it was entitled to trade
discount. The respondent quantified the outstanding commission/ trade
discount against the seeds distributed as on the date of filing of statement
of claim at Rs. 1,46,40,005.02/-and further claimed interest.
2.7 Since the Appellant did not make the said payment and disputed the
amount, the Respondent herein invoked the arbitration clause in terms of
clause 9 of the agreement dated 01.04.2010.         The parties filed their
respective claims, counter-claims, lead evidence before the Arbitral
Tribunal of a sole arbitrator.
3.  The Arbitral Tribunal framed the following issues for adjudication:
(i)    Whether the claims of the claimant are barred by law of limitation?
(ii)   Whether the Trade Discounts as provided for in the contract is
payable to the Claimant only on receipt of the subsidies by the
Respondent from the concerned State Government?
(iii)  Whether respondent is entitled to counter claims?
4.  The Arbitral Tribunal vide its award dated13.06.2019 was pleased to
allow the claim of the respondent in its entirety and awarded a sum of Rs.
1,46,40,005.02along with interest at the rate of 12% per annum (w.e.f.
Digitally Signed ByAMIT       FAO(OS) (COMM) 69/2022                                     Page 3 of 21
26.08.2017 i.e. the date of notice claiming interest on outstanding sum)
and rejected the contentions of the appellant, primarily, for the following
4.1 With regard to the aspect of limitation, the Arbitral Tribunal noted that the
Appellant     herein     acknowledged       its   liability  towards      the
Claimant/Respondent “in its ledger accounts at the end of every financial
year w.e.f. 2009-2010 till 2015-2016 by carrying forward the outstanding
balance at the end of every financial year to the subsequent financial year
and as per the above admitted ledger accounts it continued till March,
2016 and, as claimed by claimant, even thereafter, which amounts to
acknowledgement of dues within the meaning of Section 18 of Limitation
Act and extend the period of limitation”.
It was also noted by the Tribunal that Section 29 of Limitation Act
contains a saving clause in respect of Section 25 of Indian Contract Act.
The letter dated 29.06.2017 of the Appellant herein contained a clear
acknowledgement by the Appellant and the same would be treated as
„promise to pay‟ within the meaning of Section 25(3) of Indian Contract
Act. In support, the Arbitral Tribunal relied on the judgment of this court
in State Bank of India v. Kanahiya Lal [2016 SCC OnLine Del 2639].
4.2 With regard to the second issue, it was the contention of the Appellant
that it is not required to make any payment to claimant (Respondent
herein) until the subsidy amount is received by it from the concerned
State Government. The Arbitral Tribunal held that this contention cannot
be sustained and was rejected being contrary to the terms of contract
between the parties. The Arbitral Tribunal observed that ―…the claimant
who is a distributor and has discharged its part of obligation under the
Digitally Signed ByAMIT       FAO(OS) (COMM) 69/2022                                     Page 4 of 21
contract, cannot be expected to wait for its lawful dues/outstanding
payment endlessly without any provisions in the contract to this effect.
Respondent has not placed on record any documentary evidence to show
that claimant has not discharged its part of obligation under the contract.
Thus, the claimant is entitled to receive it admitted outstanding amount as
claimed by it in the present statement of claim.”
4.3 As regards the counter claim, the Arbitral Tribunal noted that the
Appellant had not brought on record any evidence to show that the
Claimant had contravened any of the provisions of the agreement. The
Arbitral Tribunal also observed that the reliance placed by the appellant
on Clause 8 of the agreement was also misplaced as much as there was no
evidence at all that sales made by claimant under the agreement between
them were against the provisions of the schemes as mentioned in the
agreement.
5.  That the appellant filed its objections under Section 34 of the Arbitration
and Conciliation Act, 1996 and assailed the award essentially on four
(i)  Firstly, the decision of the Arbitral Tribunal to reject the Appellant‟s
contention that the claims were barred by limitation, was ex facie
erroneous. The respondent‟s claim included claims for arrears of
trade discount in respect of seeds that were sold three years prior to
the filing of the Statement of Claims. He submitted before the single
judge that it was clear that part of the claim was barred by limitation
and, thus, was liable to be rejected. Further that the Arbitral Tribunal
had erroneously held that the amounts due to the respondent had
been acknowledged by the Appellant and submitted that the
Digitally Signed ByAMIT       FAO(OS) (COMM) 69/2022                                      Page 5 of 21
Appellant had merely stated that it would pay the trade discount on
receipt of subsidy and the said statement could not be construed as
an unequivocal acknowledgment of liability.
(ii) Secondly, the Appellant submitted before the Single Judge that the
Arbitral Tribunal had misinterpreted Clause 8 of the Agreement to
infer that the Appellant was liable to pay the trade discount despite
non-receipt of subsidies from the State Government of Uttar Pradesh.
(iii) Thirdly, the Appellant submitted before the Single Judge that the
interest awarded by the Arbitral Tribunal was excessive and harsh
and thus, patently illegal. For this contention, the Appellant relied on
the decision of Jaiprakash Associates Ltd. Through Its Director v.
(iv) Lastly, it was contended that the Arbitral Tribunal had erred in
rejecting the counter-claim on the ground that the Appellant had not
established the same. He submitted that the Appellant had not
received subsidies from the State Government, and it must be
presumed that the same was on account of deficiency in the
documents submitted by the respondent. He referred to Clause 11 of
the Agreement and submitted that the respondent was liable to
furnish the documents and therefore, the onus to establish that it has
done so was entirely on the respondent. He contended that the
Arbitral Tribunal had proceeded on an erroneous premise that the
burden of proof in support of the counter-claim rested on the
Appellant. He had raised a counter claim for an amount of Rs.
7,68,96,959/- claiming that it had suffered losses in respect of the
Digitally Signed ByAMIT   FAO(OS) (COMM) 69/2022                                      Page 6 of 21
6.  The learned Single Judge in the impugned order dated 05.01.2022 rejected
the objections of the appellant for the following reasonings:-
6.1 The Single Judge noted that the “ledger/statement of accounts for the
financial year beginning from 01.04.2009 to 11.12.2017 produced before
the Arbitral Tribunal duly reflected the amounts as outstanding and
payable to the respondent. The sums so reflected amounted to Rs.
1,46,42,853.06/- which was almost similar to the amounts as claimed by
the respondent.” Additionally, the single judge also noted that the
“Arbitral Tribunal found that NSCL had acknowledged the liability in its
various letters forwarded to the respondent along with a statement of
accounts. The finding of the Arbitral Tribunal that NSCL had
acknowledged its liability is a finding of fact and this Court finds no
ground to fault the same.”
6.2  The Single Judge also observed that the contentions advanced on behalf
of the Appellant in this regard, in the proceedings are inconsistent,
observing that, “On one hand, it is NSCL‘s case that its liability to pay the
trade discount was contingent upon receipt of subsidy and since it had not
received the same, the amounts claimed were not due and payable. Thus,
the respondent‘s claim was pre-mature. Inconsistent with the stand, it
also contended that the claims made by respondent are barred by
limitation.”
6.3 As regards erroneous interpretation of Clause 8 of the Agreement, the
Single Judge noted that it was clear from the plain language of Clause 8
of the Agreement that it did not provide that disbursal of trade discount to
the respondent was contingent upon receipt of subsidy as contended by
Digitally Signed ByAMIT       FAO(OS) (COMM) 69/2022                                     Page 7 of 21
Mr. Nayar. It observed that “the Arbitral Tribunal found that in terms of
Clause 8 of the Agreement, the trade discount disbursed would be
recovered in the event it was found that the respondent had breached its
obligations to supply the seeds in the notified districts. The decision of the
Arbitral Tribunal cannot be faulted.”
6.4 As regarding exorbitant interest, the single judge noted that the Arbitral
Tribunal has awarded interest at the rate of 12% per annum and the same
could not be considered exorbitant. The Single Judge further placed
reliance on the decision of the Supreme Court in Punjab State Civil
Supplies Corporation Limited (PUNSUP) and Anr. v. Ganpati Rice
Mills: SLP (C) 36655 of 2016, decided on 20.10.2021, where the court
has held that the Arbitral Tribunal has wide discretion in awarding
interest under Section 31(7)(a) of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act and
the impugned award cannot be interfered with except on the ground as set
out in Section 34 of the A&C Act. The Single Judge differentiated the
decision in Jaiprakash Associates Ltd. Through Its Director v. Tehri
6.5 As regards rejection of counter-claim of the Appellant, the Single Judge
observed that “a plain reading of Clause 11 of the Agreement, as set out
above, does not support the contentions advanced on behalf of NSCL.
Although, the respondent was required to submit the documents to NSCL
after getting them verified from the concerned authorities, there is no
assertion that the respondent had failed to submit any specific document
to NSCL as required. NSCL‘s counter-claim is premised on the basis that
the respondent had failed to perform its obligation under Clause 8 of the
Digitally Signed ByAMIT       FAO(OS) (COMM) 69/2022                                      Page 8 of 21
Agreement. There is not material to support the said claim. Thus, the
Arbitral Tribunal had concluded – and rightly so – that NSCL had failed
to substantiate its counter-claim.”
7.  It is this order and the above reasonings which have been challenged
before us in the present appeal. It has been argued by the learned senior
counsel Mr. Anil Airi appearing for the appellant that the Arbitral
Tribunal as well as the learned Single Judge had totally failed to
appreciate the terms of the contract. It is his submission that the
respondent, in the case set up before the Arbitral Tribunal, would receive
its trade discount only after the appellant receives its subsidy from the
8.  The appellant despite writing numerous letters and reminders to the State
Government has not received its share or subsidy and hence, could not be
faulted with non-payment of the amounts to the respondent.
9.  It has further been stated that by the learned counsel for the appellant that
in the entire documents submitted before the Arbitral Tribunal, there is no
admission by the appellant of the amount due and payable to the
respondent.
10. The learned senior counsel has further submitted that the claims of the
respondent are barred by limitation as they are relatable to subsidies for
the year 2010 -11, 2011 – 12, 2012 – 13, 2013 - 14and 2014-15 and the
statement of claim has been filed on 13.03.2018. Accordingly, the
respondent could only claim amounts going back 3 years in terms of the
11. Mr. Anil Airi learned senior counsel has very fairly stated that he does not
intend to argue the rejection of counter claims or on the levy of interest.

12. We have heard learned senior counsel for the appellant and have gone
through the documents on record.
13. Before we move to the analysis, it is necessary to highlight the scope of
interference in an Appeal under section 37 of the Arbitration and
14. This Court in Jhang Cooperative Group Housing Society Ltd. v. Pt.
Munshi Ram1, has also laid down the extent of scrutiny.
“16. If the Arbitrator has taken a view which the court finds
reasonable and plausible, the court would certainly not interfere.
17. The extent of judicial scrutiny under Section 34 of the
Arbitration Act 1996 is limited and scope of interference is narrow.
Under Section 37, the extent of judicial scrutiny and scope of
interference is further narrower. An appeal under Section 37 is like
a second appeal, the first appeal being to the court by way of
objections under Section 34. Where there are concurrent findings of
facts and law, first by the Arbitral Tribunal which are then
confirmed by the court while dealing with objections under Section
34, in an appeal under Section 37, the Appellate Court would be
very cautious and reluctant to interfere in the findings returned in
the award by the Arbitral Tribunal and confirmed by the court
under Section 34.
18. As laid down by the Apex Court, the supervisory role of the
court in arbitration proceedings has been kept at a minimum level
and this is because the parties to the agreement make a conscious
decision to exclude the courts jurisdiction by opting for arbitration
as the parties prefer the expediency and finality offered by it.”
Digitally Signed ByAMIT         FAO(OS) (COMM) 69/2022                                     Page 10 of 21
15. It is with this limited scope of scrutiny we will proceed with the case.
16. The issue to consider here is the acknowledgement of debt as well as the
debt being within the limitation period.
17. It will be relevant to reproduce letters dated 21.05.2016 and 29.06.2017 of
the appellant. The letters read as under:-
Sub:    Regarding payment of Rs. l,51,28,677.06
Kindly refer to your office letter dated 8.4.2016 and reminder letter dated
4.5.2016, by which request has been made for payment of Seed Seller Dealer

the period from Rabi 2011-12to 2014-15 certified seeds of Wheat, Paddy,
Chana, Matar, Urd and other seeds provided by S.F.C.I. and N.S.C. were
distributed to the farmers on the government subsidy in various districts of the
State through your Company, for which the Grant Bills provided by you
according to the farmers list were forwarded to the Deputy Director of
Agriculture of the concerned districts for payment. But till today the payment of
grant of Rs.7,83,62,896.50 (only S.F.C.I. Seed) in various Districts of the State,
according to the enclosed detail, is still pending. This office is continuously
making efforts for the above payment to Director of Agriculture, Uttar Pradesh
and the concerned Deputy Directors of Agriculture of the State, but till date no

appointment and agreement/consent letter of the seeds distributed on grant, so
that all the pending payments can be received during the present financial year.
S.F.C.I. has been continuously reminding you in writing and orally for the

payment from Agriculture Dept. Uttar Pradesh. The is in accordance to
the Clause 8 of the Agreement executed by the dealers with NSC (Copy

18. A bare perusal of the aforesaid letters clearly shows that the appellant has
clearly admitted the amounts due and payable to the respondent. There is
not a letter or document brought to our notice where the appellant has
denied payment of this commission or the amount. In view of this clear
admission, there is no doubt that commission is due and payable by the
appellant to the respondent and hence, there is a clear acknowledgment of
a debt by the Appellant.
19. Having said that, the next question which arises for our determination is
with regard to the claims of the respondent being barred by limitation.
20. The ledger/ statement of accounts for the Financial Year beginning
01.04.2009 to 11.12.2017 produced before the Arbitral Tribunal duly
reflects the amount outstanding and payable to the respondent. The same
has been carefully examined by the Arbitral Tribunal. The relevant
portion recording the finding of the Arbitral Tribunal is reproduced as
“In the present case, the Claimant filed on record the ledger
accounts of respondent in respect of the transactions in question for
financial year 1stApril, 2009 to 31stMarch, 2016 and also the ledger
accounts of the claimant for 1st April, 2009 to 11th December, 2017
which are part of Exht. CW-1/9 series (Pg. No. 47 to 136 of SoC).
The amounts as claimed by the claimant are duly reflected in the
above said ledger accounts of respondent as outstanding. These
ledger accounts further reveal that at the end of every year, the
balance outstanding payable sum was carried forward and shown
in the ledger accounts for following financial year acknowledging
the outstanding sum payable to claimant. The Ledger
Accounts/Statement of Accounts for the financial years beginning
from 1st April 2009 upto 11th December 2017 (Exhibit CW1/9, colly)
that reflect the said outstanding sums being carried forward from
Digitally Signed ByAMIT       FAO(OS) (COMM) 69/2022                                     Page 14 of 21
time to time, summing up to a total of Rs. 1,46,42,853.06/- (Rupees
Fifty Three and Six Paise Only) as on 31.03.2016 (Pg. No. 81 of
SoC), which amount also matches with the outstanding amount as
on 31.03.2016 as appearing in the ledger account of respondent
filed by claimant (Pg. 136 of S0C). This figure of outstanding
amount almost matches with the amount claimed in the present case
i.e. Rs. 1,46,40,005.02 (Rupees One Crore Forty Six Lakh Forty
Thousand and Five and two Paise Only).”
21. It was also noted by the Arbitral Tribunal that the Appellant herein has not
denied the averments made by the claimant/Respondent or disputed the
ledger accounts. Following is the response of the Appellant:
―That the contents of Para 6(ix) are barred by limitation. It is
submitted that the claims of the Claimant are barred by limitation
under the Limitation Act, 1973 for the sums claimed in financial
years 2010-2011 for Rs. 32,42,394.55/-, 2011-2012 for Rs.
20,41,133.70/-, 2012-2013 for Rs. 39,61,496.80/-, 2013-2014 for
Rs. 32,62,466/-, 2014-2015 for Rs. 26,21,186/for amounts due
before 13.03.2015 i.e. 3 (three) years before filing of the Statement
of Claim.‖
22. The letters which we have already reproduced acknowledge the amounts
due and payable by the appellant to the respondent. The Appellant has
admitted the amounts due and payable to the respondent in its ledger/
statement of accounts, the said entries constitute a fresh cause of action
and extends the period of limitation. The witness of the Appellant, RW-1,
Mr. Aseem Gangwar during cross-examination recorded on 24.01.2019
“Ques. 13: Can you explain whenever any agreement is executed by
NSC     with   distributor   whether      previous    pending
Digitally Signed ByAMIT       FAO(OS) (COMM) 69/2022                                     Page 15 of 21
commissions of the distributors whether previous pending
commissions of the distributors are carried forward and
mentioned in such agreements?
Ans. 13:   In the agreements no such provision is made, however,
since the accounts are maintained by NSC at regional office
level, which accounts reflects the outstanding commission of
the distributor, NSC carried it forward in the account of the
distributors in its books.”
Once the ledger duly reflects the amount as outstanding and
payable, the period of limitation would run from the said date.The same
has also been observed in the Supreme Court judgment in Asset
Reconstruction Co. (India) Ltd. v. Bishal Jaiswal2, holding the
“18. Likewise, in a case concerning the dishonour of a cheque
under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881, this
Court in A.V. Murthy v. B.S. Nagabasavanna [A.V. Murthy v. B.S.
Nagabasavanna, (2002) 2 SCC 642] [―A.V. Murthy‖], held : (SCC p.
―5. … It is also pertinent to note that under sub-section (3) of
Section 25 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872, a promise, made in
writing and signed by the person to be charged therewith, or by
his agent generally or specially authorised in that behalf, to pay
wholly or in part a debt of which the creditor might have enforced
payment but for the law for the limitation of suits, is a valid
contract. Moreover, in the instant case, the appellant has
submitted before us that the respondent, in his balance sheet
prepared for every year subsequent to the loan advanced by the
appellant, had shown the amount as deposits from friends. A copy
Digitally Signed ByAMIT         FAO(OS) (COMM) 69/2022                                    Page 16 of 21
of the balance sheet as on 31-3-1997 is also produced before us.
If the amount borrowed by the respondent is shown in the
balance sheet, it may amount to acknowledgment and the
creditor might have a fresh period of limitation from the date on
which the acknowledgment was made. However, we do not
express any final opinion on all these aspects, as these are matters
to be agitated before the Magistrate by way of defence of the
respondent.‖
26. This judgment in Vijayalakshmi case [Vijayalakshmi v. Hari
Hara Ginning & Pressing, 1999 SCC OnLine AP 1115] does not, in
any manner, even purport to lay down the law. That apart, the
statement that an acknowledgment, as envisaged by the Limitation
Act, has to be with the intention of accepting the debt with the object
of extending the limitation for recovery is dehors Section 18 of the
Limitation Act and directly contrary to ShapoorFredoom
Mazda [Khan Bahadur ShapoorFredoom Mazda v. Durga Prasad
Chamaria, (1962) 1 SCR 140 : AIR 1961 SC 1236] which is, in fact,
referred to in the very next paragraph of the aforesaid
judgment. ShapoorFredoom               Mazda [Khan              Bahadur
ShapoorFredoom Mazda v. Durga Prasad Chamaria, (1962) 1 SCR
140 : AIR 1961 SC 1236] had made it plain that all that was
necessary was that the acknowledgment establishes a jural
relationship of debtor and creditor, which undoubtedly was
established on the facts of that case. This judgment, therefore,
cannot avail the respondents.
35. A perusal of the aforesaid sections would show that there is no
doubt that the filing of a balance sheet in accordance with the
provisions of the Companies Act is mandatory, any transgression of
the same being punishable by law. However, what is of importance is
that notes that are annexed to or forming part of such financial
statements are expressly recognised by Section 134(7). Equally, the
auditor's report may also enter caveats with regard to
acknowledgments made in the books of accounts including the
balance sheet. A perusal of the aforesaid would show that the

statement of law contained in Bengal Silk Mills [Bengal Silk Mills
Co. v. Ismail Golam Hossain Ariff, 1961 SCC OnLine Cal 128 : AIR
1962 Cal 115] , that there is a compulsion in law to prepare a
balance sheet but no compulsion to make any particular admission,
is correct in law as it would depend on the facts of each case as to
whether an entry made in a balance sheet qua any particular creditor
is unequivocal or has been entered into with caveats, which then has
to be examined on a case by case basis to establish whether an
acknowledgment of liability has, in fact, been made, thereby
extending limitation under Section 18 of the Limitation Act.”
23. It is important to note that the court, while deciding objections, cannot
re-appreciate the evidence, or the documents. If the Arbitral Tribunal has
arrived at its findings on the basis of material placed before him,
admissibility of a document is an aspect which is within the exclusive
domain of the Arbitral Tribunal, and finding based thereupon should not
be interfered with lightly. That being the position, the findings of the
Arbitral Tribunal were rightly upheld by Single Judge. As far as we are
concerned, the Arbitral Tribunal has correctly relied upon Section 18 of
The Limitation Act to hold:
“It is settled law that acknowledgment of debt in the books of
accounts/balance sheet extends the period of limitation. Hon‘ble
Supreme Court in Mahabir Cold Storage Vs. Commissioner of
Income Tax AIR 1991 SC 1357 held that entries in the books of
account amount to acknowledgment of liability within the
meaning of Section 18 of the Limitation Act, 1963 and extend the
period of limitation for the discharge liability as debt…..”
24. We also approve the reliance on Section 25 of the Indian Contract Act.
Following are the findings and observations of the Arbitral Tribunal:

“11.24 It is also pertinent to note that in addition to Section 18 of
the Limitation Act, Ld. Counsel for Claimant has also relied on the
provisions of Section 25 of the Indian Contract Act in support of the
plea that claims of claimant are within the limitation period. It is
contended by the Ld. Counsel for Claimant that letter dated
29.06.2017 of Respondent, which is part of Exht. RW/4 (Colly) (Pg.
32 of SoD), contains a clear acknowledgment by respondent in
respect of outstanding amounts payable to claimant by it and the
same would be treated as ‗promise to pay‘ within the meaning of
Section 25(3) of Indian Contract Act. Section 25 of Indian Contract
―25. Section 25 in The Indian Contract Act, 1872: Agreement
without consideration, void, unless it is in writing and
registered or is a promise to compensate for something done or
is a promise to pay a debt barred by limitation law.—An
agreement made without consideration is void, unless—
(1) it is expressed in writing and registered under the law for
the time being in force for the registration of 1[documents], and
is made on account of natural love and affection between
parties standing in a near relation to each other; or unless
(2) it is a promise to compensate, wholly or in part, a person
who has already voluntarily done something for the promisor,
or something which the promisor was legally compellable to do;
or unless.
(3) It is a promise, made in writing and signed by the person to
be charged therewith, or by his agent generally or specially
authorized in that behalf, to pay wholly or in part a debt of
which the creditor might have enforced payment but for the law
for the limitation of suits. In any of these cases, such an
agreement is a contract.
11.26 The aforesaid proposition of law was reiterated by the
Hon‘ble Delhi High Court in the case of State Bank of India Vs.
Kanahiya Lal & Anr. reported as 2016 SCC OnLine Del 2639,
Digitally Signed ByAMIT FAO(OS) (COMM) 69/2022                                     Page 19 of 21
while also explaining the distinction between the provision of
Section 18 of Limitation Act and Section 25 of Indian Contract Act.
The relevant para of said decision are reproduced below:
“24. No doubt, there is a distinction between an
acknowledgement under Section 18 of the Limitation Act and a
promise under Section 25(3) of the Indian Contract Act inasmuch
as though both have the effect of giving a fresh lease of life to the
creditor to sue the debtor, but, for an acknowledgement under
Section 18 of the Limitation Act to be applicable, the same must
be made on or before the date of expiry of the period of limitation
whereas such a condition is nonexistent so far as the promise
under Section 25(3) of the Indian Contract Act is concerned. A
promise under Clause 3 of Section 25 of the Indian Contract Act,
even made after the expiry of the period of limitation would be
applicable and would cause revival of the claim, notwithstanding
the limitation. Under Section 25(3) of the Indian Contract Act, a
promise in writing to pay in whole or in part, a time barred debt
is not void.‖
25. Furthermore, the Ld. Single Judge, as noted above has correctly stated
that the arguments of the Appellant are contradictory in nature. We are
firmly of the view that none of the claims of the respondent are barred by
limitation, in light of the discussion above and on account of Section 18
of the Limitation Act and Section 25 of the Indian Contract Act.
26. The next issue is whether the payment due and payable to the Respondent
can be dependent on the appellant receiving its share of subsidy from the
State Government of Uttar Pradesh.
27. The learned senior counsel has fairly stated that there is no Clause in the
agreement which provides such a condition. However, he has relied on
Clause 8 of the agreement which reads as under:-
Digitally Signed ByAMIT       FAO(OS) (COMM) 69/2022                                     Page 20 of 21
―8.       The second party fully agrees and undertakes to sell
the seeds only in the notified Districts under
NFSM/ISOPOM/MMA as per Guidelines of the appropriate
authority. If any sales are made by the second party against the
provisions of the said schemes and the subsidy is not released
to the first party the losses incurred on this account will be
compensated by the second party to the Corporation in addition
to refund of subsidy.‖
28. A bare perusal of the said Clause clearly shows that it nowhere provides
that disbursal of subsidy to the respondent, is contingent on receipt of
subsidy by the appellant from the State Government of Uttar Pradesh. It is
not the case of the appellant that the respondent had breached any of its
obligations to supply the seeds in terms of the distributorship agreement.
The same has also been correctly held by the Arbitral Tribunal and
reaffirmed by the Single Judge.
29. In this view of the matter, we find no reason to interfere in the judgment
dated 05.01.2022 and consequently, the appeal is dismissed.
