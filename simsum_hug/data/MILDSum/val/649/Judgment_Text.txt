2.     The 1st petitioner is a kidney patient. She is
undergoing treatment for kidney problem at the West Fort Hi-
Tech Hospital, Thrissur. It is medically found that both the
kidneys of the 1st petitioner have spoiled and it needs urgent
transplantation. She is undergoing dialysis thrice in a week.
Ext.P1 is the certificate issued by the hospital concerned. It is
submitted that the kidneys of the close relatives of the 1 st
petitioner is not suitable for transplantation. The father of the
1st petitioner is aged 80 years and mother is aged 75 years and
they are suffering from old age ailments. The elder brother of
the 1st petitioner is from different blood group and younger
brother is a diabetic patient. Her husband is aged 54 years
and is also a diabetic patient. Children aged 18 and 15 years
are at tender age. It is the case of the petitioner that she has no
other close relatives. Therefore, the 1 st petitioner could not
transplant the kidney from the close relatives. It is submitted
by the learned counsel for the petitioner that the younger son
of the 1st petitioner is suffering from Spastic Cerebral Palsy.
Ext.P2 is the certificate issued by the District Medical Board,
District Hospital, Manjeri showing that the child is suffering
from Cerebral Palsy. It is the case of the 1st petitioner that she
has to look after this child also with the meager income of her
husband from his tea shop. Since the 1st petitioner is also
detected with kidney disease, the pathetic story of the 1 st
petitioner and her family was reported in Mathrubhumi and
an online news of Mathrubhumi dated 10.09.2021 is
produced as Ext.P3. It is submitted that since the kidney of the
close relatives of the 1st petitioner is not suitable for
transplantation, the 2nd petitioner, considering the pathetic
situation of the 1st petitioner and her family, has informed her
willingness to donate her kidney to the 1 st petitioner. The
husband of the 2nd petitioner was working with the husband of
the 1st petitioner in his hotel for several years. Since the hotel
was closed due to Covid 19 pandemic, now the husband of the
2nd petitioner is working in his Village. It is the case of the
petitioners that the families of the petitioners are very close
and they know each other. According to the 2nd petitioner, it is
a voluntary act from her side to donate the kidney to the 1 st
3.     Ext.P4 is the certificate issued by the Deputy
Superintendent of Police, Chittur.        Ext.P5 is the certificate
issued by the President of Cherukavu Grama Panchayat.
Ext.P6 is the certificate issued by the Member of Legislative
Assembly, Nenmara.           Ext.P7 is the affidavit of the 2nd
respondent. Ext.P8 is the identification certificate of the donor
and her father. Ext.P9 is the identification certificate of the
donor and her mother. Similarly, Ext.P10 is the identification
certificate of the donor and her husband. Exts.P11 and P12
are the applications submitted by the petitioners for organ
transplantation. Ext.P13 is the communication issued by the
hospital concerned to the respondents. Ext.P14 is the order
passed by the respondent.           The respondent rejected the
application submitted by the petitioner.        Aggrieved by the
same, this writ petition is filed.
4.     Heard the learned counsel for the petitioners and
the learned Government Pleader for the respondent.
5.     The learned counsel for the petitioner submitted
that the 1st petitioner is in a pathetic situation now and she is
undergoing dialysis thrice in a week. Her younger son is a
Cerebral Palsy affected child and she is the only person to look
after him. Her both kidneys are now spoiled. In such situation,
the 2nd petitioner voluntarily decided to help her. The finding
in Ext.P14 is absolutely incorrect. It is submitted that the 1 st
and 2nd petitioners are from an economically weaker section,
which is clear from Ext.P3 news item published in
Mathrubhumi. Therefore, the respondent erred in finding that
since the donor is from a poor family, the application cannot
be considered. The learned counsel submitted that the 2nd
petitioner is also from a poor family and when she appeared
for interrogation before a team of expert doctors, there was
some confusion while submitting the details.        The learned
counsel submitted that the 2nd petitioner will be able to submit
the facts before the committee and there is no contradiction as
stated in Ext.P14.
6.     The learned Government Pleader submitted that the
respondent, after going through the records and after
interrogating the petitioners, came to the conclusion that the
approval cannot be granted in this case. Therefore, this Court
may not interfere with the same.
7.     I perused Ext.P14 order.  It would be better to
extract the relevant portion in Ext.P14:
“Permission is not granted for the following
reasons.
Altruism regarding the transplantation is not
proved before the committee.
Document        signed   by    the    village    officer
pudunagaram        is  found    to   be    false   from
interrogation with his husband and wife enrolled
in the document. Donor is coming from a poor
family and staying at Kannanaloor colony, at
Kollam District where it was learned there were
several unrelated previous kidney donors. Police
verification from Kollam is lacking.
Rule 7 Sub Rule (3)(1) to (VI) is not complied
with the transplantation of Human Organs and
Tissues Act 1994 and the transplantation of
Human Organs and Tissues Rules 2014.
Hence the committee unanimously rejected
the case.”
8. One of the ground mentioned in Ext.P14 is that the
document signed by the Village Officer, Pudunagaram is found
to be false after the interrogation with the husband and wife
enrolled in the document.       According to the petitioners, the
husband of the donor is from Kollam, but they are settled at
Palakkad.         While making the submission, there was some
confusion and that is why the respondent concluded that the
document signed by the Village Officer is found to be false. I
don't know, how the respondent can conclude that the
document signed by the Village Officer is false. Respondent has
no authority to declare that a certificate issued by a Village
Officer is false, while considering an application for
transplantation. The learned counsel submitted that the 2 nd
petitioner will be able to explain the same before the
committee, if an opportunity is given. While interrogating the
parties, the respondent should take a mild stand. The intention
of the respondent should be only to find out whether there is
commercial transaction. Parties may be coming from remote
village area. A friendly atmosphere is to be created by the
respondent while interrogating.
9.     The second ground mentioned in Ext.P14 is that the
donor is coming from a poor family and staying at
Kannanaloor Colony at Kollam district. I failed to understand
this reasoning of the respondent. Simply because a donor is
coming from a poor family, there is no hindrance for donating
the organs. If that is the case, the 1 st petitioner is also from a
poor family. For this purpose, this Court can take judicial
notice of Ext.P3 report of Mathrubhumi which is one of the
leading Malayalam daily newspaper in Kerala. We have to
appreciate such news items items from print and visual media,
so that the people with big hearts can come forward to help
needy people. I read Ext.P3 news item. From this, it is clear
that the donor and recipient are from poor family. There is no
rule that, poor people can't donate organs. Being poor is not a
sin. The people with big hearts are there in plenty in our
country and they can save them. That is how we can reduce
the difference between haves and have-nots.
10. It is further stated in Ext.P14 that, there were
several unrelated kidney donors in the area where the donor
resides. That also cannot be accepted without any evidence. I
think it is a matter to be reconsidered by the respondent in the
facts and circumstances of the case. The points to be decided
by the respondent is whether there is any commercial
11. In such circumstances, according to me, Ext.P14
can be set aside and the matter can be reconsidered by the
Therefore, the writ petition is allowed in the following
1.      Ext.P14 is set aside.
2.      The respondent is directed to reconsider the
application    of    the    petitioners  and   pass
appropriate orders, in accordance with law, at
any rate within a period of one week from the
date of receipt of a copy of this judgment.
