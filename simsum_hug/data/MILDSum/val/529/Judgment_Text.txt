The petitioner is before this Court calling in question a Look
Out Circular (‘LOC’ for short) dated 07-03-2022 issued by the 2nd
respondent/Bank of Baroda (‘the Bank’ for short) and executed by
the 1st respondent/Bureau of Immigration and has sought a
consequent direction by issuance of a writ in the nature of
mandamus or declaration declaring that the action of the 2nd
respondent/Bank in issuing LOC to be arbitrary and illegal and also
for other consequential reliefs.
2. Heard Sri K.Shashikiran Shetty, learned senior counsel
appearing for the petitioner, Sri H.Shanti Bhushan, learned Deputy
Solicitor General appearing for respondents 1 and 3 and Sri Nagaraj
Damodar, learned counsel appearing for respondent No.2.
3. Brief facts that lead the petitioner to this court in the
subject petition, as borne out from the pleadings, are as follows:-
The petitioner claims to be having certain business operations
at Bangalore in wood products for over 35 years. A Company by
name Associate Décor Limited (‘Company’ for short) comes to be
registered in the year 2007 under the provisions of the Companies
Act, 1956, a company that would deal with wood products in the
State of Karnataka.       The petitioner claims to have assets and
businesses both in India and abroad particularly in United Arab
Emirates (‘UAE’) and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (‘SA’) for which
purpose the petitioner frequently travels both to UAE and SA. The
Company had obtained finance from the 2nd respondent/Bank
mortgaging a property worth Rs.199/- crores. The petitioner was at
the relevant point in time Director of the Company and had not
stood as a guarantor to the loan obtained by the Company.
According to the averment in the petition the petitioner was only a
non-functional Director and there were number of guarantors who
stood guarantee to the loan advanced to the Company.
4. When the loan became sticky, consortium of Banks
initiated various proceedings against the petitioner as the Company
had defaulted in repayment after obtaining finance from several
Banks. One such proceeding was instituted before the Debts
Recovery Tribunal, Bengaluru (‘DRT’) in O.A.No.629 of 2021 by the
Bank against the Company for recovery of the amount that was due
to be paid to the Bank.     The petitioner was not a party to the
proceedings. The averment in the entire petition is that the
petitioner is a non-Executive Director of the Company as he has
nothing to do with the borrowals of the Company. Things standing
thus, the petitioner wanted to travel to UAE and SA for business
purpose. At that point in time, LOC is issued by the 2nd
respondent/Bank on the ground that recovery proceedings before
the DRT are pending consideration against the petitioner and the
petitioner, if permitted to travel is likely to escape from those
5. The petitioner on coming to know that his right to travel
has been curtailed by the act of the Bank approached the Bank
seeking to withdraw the LOC by bringing to its notice that he has
nothing to do with the loan account or the loan amount that was
sought and granted to the Company.          The LOC, as observed
hereinabove, has originated from the 2nd respondent and the reason
for such generation of LOC is that DRT proceedings are pending
against the Company. On receipt of a requisition from the 2nd
respondent/Bank for issuance of LOC, the 1st respondent/Bureau of
Immigration issues LOC against the petitioner on 07-03-2022 and
curtails his travels. The curtailment of his travel is what drives the
petitioner to this Curt raising a challenge to the LOC so issued by
the 2nd respondent and executed by the 1st respondent.
6. The learned senior counsel Sri K.Shashikiran Shetty,
appearing for the petitioner would contend with vehemence that the
petitioner is noway concerned with the finance that is borrowed by
the Company from the 2nd respondent/Bank. The petitioner is only a
non-functional Director. He would take this Court through the
documents appended to the petition and seeks to demonstrate that
the petitioner is only a non-functional Director, he is not the
borrower, he is not the decision maker/taker at the time of
borrowing the amount and he is not the guarantor. He would
submit that curtailment of right of the petitioner to travel would
violate fundamental right of the petitioner. He seeks quashment of
the LOC and all further proceedings taken thereto.
7. On the other hand, the learned counsel appearing for the
2nd respondent/Bank which is the originator of the LOC would seek
to contend that if the petitioner is permitted to travel abroad he
would escape consequences of the proceedings before the DRT
against the Company which is pending adjudication and, therefore,
the LOC is rightly sought to be issued against the petitioner, as he
is one of the decision makers at the time when the finance was
borrowed from the 2nd respondent/Bank.
8.  The    Deputy   Solicitor General  of India  representing
respondents 1 and 3 would contend that it was on a request made
by the 2nd respondent/Bank the LOC had to be issued against the
petitioner, failing which, he would run away and not be available for
trial. Therefore, no fault can be found with the Bank, the originator
and seeking its execution. He would place reliance upon the
judgment rendered by the Division Bench of this Court in DR.
BAVAGUTHURAGHURAM                  SHETTY     v.    BUREAU        OF
IMMIGRATION AND OTHERS - Writ Appeal No.315 of 2021
decided on 12.05.2021.
9. I have given my anxious consideration to the submissions
made by the respective learned counsel and have perused the
material on record.
10. The issue lies in a narrow compass namely, “whether
the 2nd respondent/Bank could have otherwise curtailed
fundamental right of the petitioner to travel abroad, except
in accordance with law?”
11. The Company is the borrower from the Bank. The
petitioner claims to be a non-functional Director. The Bank
undertakes review of credit facility extended to the Company on
19-05-2016. While so reviewing the following persons are shown to
be persons who stood as guarantors to the loan advanced by the
2nd respondent/Bank to the Company:
a.    Pari-passu first charge on factory land and
b.     Pari-passu first charge on P&M and other
moveable assets.
Collateral: Pledge of 50% of the Promoters share
holding in the Company.
The name of the petitioner does not figure here. The claim of the
petitioner is that he is a non-functional Director, to demonstrate
that, a document at Annexure-E is appended to the petition. The
names of Directors as on 27-02-2017 of the borrower Company are
(Emphasis added)
The name of the petitioner figures as a Director with effect from
12. The amount that was borrowed by the Company had
become sticky. The Bank initiated proceedings against the Company
before the Debts Recovery Tribunal, Bengaluru in O.A.No.629 of
2021. A perusal at the cause title therein would indicate that the
petitioner is not even made a party to those proceedings. The facts
of the case as narrated before the Tribunal would indicate that the
petitioner had no role to play in the borrowing of the amount by the
Company from the 2nd respondent/Bank albeit, prima facie. The
issue now is, in the teeth of the aforesaid facts, where the
petitioner is yet to be shown to be involved in any case of
embezzlement of funds or fraud played with the Bank being
Director of the Company, could lead to issuance of LOC curtailing
travel of the petitioner abroad.
13. To consider the said issue, it is germane to notice
relevant guidelines operating for issuance of LOC. The Government
of India has from to time issued certain official memoranda in the
form of guidelines for issuance of LOC. The guidelines are issued
from time to time in supersession of earlier guidelines or in
furtherance of earlier guidelines. The latest of the guidelines
operating in the field is the one issued on 22-02-2021. The
guidelines read as follows:
“6.    The existing guidelines with regard to issuance of
Look Out Circulars (LOC) in respect of Indian citizens and
foreigners have been reviewed by this Ministry. After due
deliberations in consultation with various stakeholders and in
supersession of all the existing guidelines issued vide this
Ministry’s letters/O.M. referred to in para 1 above, it has been
decided with the approval of the competent authority that the
following consolidated guidelines shall be followed henceforth by
all concerned for the purpose of issuance of Look Out Circulars
(LOC) in respect of Indian citizens and foreigners:-
(A)   The request for opening an LOC would be made by
the Originating Agency (OA) to the Deputy Director,
Bureau of Immigration (BOI), East Block – VIII,
26192883, email:boihq@nic.in) in the enclosed
(B)    The request for opening of LOC must invariably be
issued with the approval of an Originating Agency
that shall be an officer not below the rank of –
(i)    Deputy Secretary to the Government of India; or
(ii)   Joint Secretary in the State Government; or
(iii)  District Magistrate of the District concerned; or
(iv)   Superintendent of Police (SP) of the District
(v)    SP in CBI or an officer of equivalent level working
(vi)   Zonal Director in Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) or
an officer of equivalent level [including Assistant

equivalent level in the Directorate of
Revenue Intelligence or Central Board of
Direct Taxes or Central Board of Indirect
Taxes and Customs; or
(viii) Assistant       Director       of      Intelligence
Bureau/Bureau of Immigration (BOI); or
(ix)   Deputy Secretary of Research and Analysis
(x)    An     officer    not    below    the    level    of
Superintendent        of   Police    in    National
Investigation Agency; or
(xi)   Assistant Director of Enforcement Directorate;
(xii) Protector of Emigrants in the office of the
Protectorate of Emigrants or an officer not
below the rank of Deputy Secretary to the
Government of India; or
(xiii) Designated officer of Interpol; or
(xiv) An officer of Serious Fraud Investigation
Office (SFIO), Ministry of Corporate Affairs
not below the rank of Additional Director (in
the rank of Director in the Government of
Executive of all Public Sector Banks.
(C) LOC can also be issued as per directions of any
Criminal Court in India. In all such cases, request
for opening of LOC shall be initiated by the local
police or by any other Law Enforcement Agencies
concerned so that all parameters for opening LOCs
are available.
(D) The name and designation of the officer signing the
Proforma for requesting issuance of an LOC must
invariably be mentioned without which the request
for issuance of LOC would not be entertained.
(E) The contact details of the Originator must be provided in
column VI of the enclosed Proforma. The contact
telephone/mobile number of the respective control room
should    also     be   mentioned    to    ensure     proper
communication for effective follow up action. Originator
shall also provide the following additional information in
column VI of the enclosed Proforma to ensure proper
communication for effective follow up action:-
(i)    Two Gov/ NIC email IDs
(ii)    Landline number of two officials
(iii)  Mobile numbers of at least two officials, one of
whom shall be the originator
(F) Care must be taken by the Originating Agency to ensure
that complete Identifying particulars of the person, in
respect of whom the LOC is to be opened, are indicated in
the Proforma mentioned above. It should be noted that
an LOC cannot be opened unless a minimum of three
identifying parameters viz. name & parentage, passport
number or Date of Birth are available. However, LOC can
also be issued if name and passport particulars of the
person concerned are available. It is the responsibility of
the originator to constantly review the LOC requests and
proactively provide additional parameters to minimize
harazzment      to    genuine   passengers.     Details   of
Government identity cards like PAN Card, Driving License,
Aadhaar Card, Voter Card etc, may also be included in the
request for opening LOC.
(G) The legal liability of the action taken by the immigration
authorities in pursuance of the LOC rests with the
originating agency
(H) Recourse to LOC is to be taken in cognizable
offences under IPC or other penal laws. The details
in column IV in the enclosed Proforma regarding
‘reason for opening LOC’ must invariably be
provided without which the subject of an LOC will
not be arrested/detained.
(I) In cases where there is no cognizable offence under
IPC and other penal laws, the LOC subject cannot
be detained/arrested or prevented from leaving the
country. The Originating Agency can only request
that they be informed about the arrival /departure
of the subject in such cases.
(J) The LOC opened shall remain in force until and
unless a deletion request is received by Bol from
the Originator itself. No LOC shall be deleted
automatically. Originating Agency must keep
reviewing the LOCs opened at its behest on
quarterly and annual basis and submit the
proposals to delete the LOC. if any, immediately
after such a review. The BOI should contact the LOC
Originators through normal channels as well as
through the online portal. In all cases where the
person against whom LOC has been opened is no
longer wanted by the Originating Agency or by
Competent Court, the LOC deletion request must be
conveyed in Bol immediately so that liberty of the
individual is not jeopardized.
(K) On many occasions, persons against whom LOCs are
issued,       obtain       Orders       regarding     LOC
deletion/quashing/suspension from Courts and approach
ICPs for LOC deletion and seek their departure. Since
ICPs have no means of verifying genuineness of the Court
Order, in all such          cases, orders for deletion/
quashing/suspension etc. of LOC, must be communicated
to the Bol through the same Originator who requested for
opening of LOC. Hon'ble Courts may be requested by the
Law Enforcement Agency concerned to endorse/convey
orders regarding LOC suspension/ deletion/quashing etc.
to the same law enforcement agency through which LOC
was opened.
(L) In exceptional cases, LOCs can be issued even in
such cases, may not be covered by the guidelines
above, whereby departure of a person from India
may be declined at the request of any of the
authorities mentioned in clause (B) above, if it
appears to such authority based on inputs received
that the departure of such person is detrimental to
the sovereignty or security or integrity of India or
that the same is detrimental to the bilateral
relations with any country or to the strategic
and/or economic interests of India or if such
person is allowed to leave, he may potentially
indulge in an act of terrorism or offences against
the State and/or that such departure ought not be
permitted in the larger public interest at any given
point in time.
(M) The following procedure will be adopted in case
statutory bodies like the NCW, the NHRC and the
National Commission for Protection of Children's
Rights request for preventing any Indian/ foreigner
from leaving India. Such requests along with full
necessary facts shall be brought to the notice of law
enforcement       agencies      like  the    police.    The
Superintendent of Police (S.P.) concerned will then
make the request for issuance of an LOC upon an
assessment of the situation, and strictly in terms of
the procedure outlined for the purpose.                 The
immigration/emigration authorities will strictly go
by the communication received from the officers
authorized to open LOCs as detailed in Clause (B)
above.
(N) For effective and better interception of LOC subjects,
following guidelines shall be followed by the Originator:-
(i)    Specific action to be taken by the Immigration
authorities on detection must be indicated in the
filled LOC proforma.
(ii)   In case of any change in parameters / actions /
investigating officer/ Originator contact details or if
any court order is passed in the case, the same
should be brought to the notice of the BoI
immediately by the originating agency concerned
for making necessary changes in the LOC.
(iii)  For LOCs originated on court orders, the
concerned PS / IO should send the identifying
parameters of the subject to the BoI as court
orders contain only name and parentage of
the subject./
(iv)   In case an LOC is challenged and stayed by
the concerned court or a court issues any
directive with regard to the LOC, the
Originator must inform the BoI urgently and
accordingly seek amendment/deletion of the
(v)    Whenever the subject of LOC is arrested or
the purpose of the LOC is over, a deletion
request shall be sent by the Originator
immediately to the BoI.
(vi)   The Originator must respond promptly whenever
the subject / likely match is detected a the ICP.
The confirmation regarding the identity of the
subject and action to be taken must be informed
immediately to the ICP.
(vii)  The BOI would form a team to coordinate matters
regarding the LOC. This team would contact the
LOC issuing agencies to get the status of LOC
updated.
(viii) Each LOC Originating Agency referred in para 6 (B)
above will appoint a Nodal officer as indicated in
Annexure – I for coordination/ updation of LOC
status with BoI.     The said team of BoI [as
mentioned in para 6(N) (vii)] would remain in
constant touch with this Nodal Officer.
7.    It is requested that the consolidated guidelines as
contained in this O.M. may be brought to the notice of all
concerned for strict compliance.”
In the recitals of the guidelines it is clearly indicated that LOC is to
be opened in the proforma under certain circumstances. Recourse
to LOC can be taken in cognizable offences under the IPC or other
penal laws. In exceptional cases LOC can be issued regarding
economic offences as well. LOC once issued shall remain in force
until and unless a deletion request is made by the originator. The
originator in the case at hand is the 2nd respondent/Bank. The
request dated 25-02-2022 for issuance of LOC against the
petitioner reads as follows:
Re: Request for issuance/opening of Look Out Circulars
against (1) Mr.Mohamed Farouk Suleman Darvesh @
Darvesh, Director and/or Guarantors in M/s Assciate Décor
This is with reference to the consolidated guidelines dated 22-02-
2021 issued by the Government of India, Minsitry of Home Affairs,
Foreigners Division (Immigration Section), and Letter dated 22-11-
2018 of the Department of Financial Services (DFS) whereby the
“Chairman/Managing Director/Chief Executives of all Public Sector
Banks” are also empowered to make request for opening of Look
Out circular (LOC) against Indian Citizens and Foreigners.
In terms of the same our Managing Director and CEO, Mr. Sanjiv
Chadha has given his sanction for issuance of request for opening
of LOC against (1) Mr.Mohamed Farouk Suleman Darvesh @
We enclose herewith the proforma/request for issuance of Look Out
Circular (LOC) in the name of (1) Mr.Mohamed Farouk Suleman
Sabana Oosman Darvesh @ Shabana Usman Darvesh duly signed
(DIGITALLY) by our Managing Director and CEO and request you to
issue/open LOCs against (1) Mr.Mohamed Farouk Suleman Darvesh
Sabana Oosman Darvesh @ Shabana Usman Darvesh at the
earliest.
The Bank requests the Bureau of Immigration to issue LOC against
the petitioner and several others. The reason for seeking issuance
of LOC is conspicuously absent in the communication. The Managing
Director of the 2nd respondent Bank has sanctioned issuance of
request for opening a LOC against the petitioner and others is all
that the communication mentions. The said request for LOC leads
issuance of one which the 1st respondent seeks to execute. The
communication made by the Bank reads as follows:
Letter to the LOC Subjects
393, 2nd Main Road, Near Bank of India,
Re: A/c M/s ASSOCIATE DÉCOR LIMITED with our Bank.
Please refer to the captioned Loan Account with our
Bank. The account is having outstanding of Rs.163.48
This is to inform you that bank has requested
immigration authorities to issue Look Out Circular against
you as you have defaulted in repayment of huge dues to
the Bank in the above mentioned account.
Yours faithfully,
The afore-quoted communication is what is communicated to the
petitioner by the Bank which reads that the Bank has requested
Immigration Authorities to issue LOC against the petitioner for
defaulting in repayment of huge dues to the Bank. The petitioner is
not an accused in any crime. He is not the Director who had signed
on the dotted lines seeking any loan. The petitioner who           is
described    as    Director has   produced  abundant    material  to
demonstrate that he is only non-functional Director. The list of
guarantors is also extracted hereinabove. The petitioner is not
shown as a guarantor to any kind of loan advanced.            If the
petitioner has no role to play in the entire transaction, issuance of
LOC against him can hardly be justified.
14. The issuance of LOC which comes about on 07-03-2022
with the 2nd respondent being the originator is bereft of reasons as
to why the Bank wants curtailment of travel of the petitioner. The
afore-quoted excerpts of the loan document nowhere indicates that
the petitioner is the borrower; no criminal proceedings are pending
against him; there is an embargo ordered by the Court for him to
travel, nor that the petitioner is likely to evade trial if he is
permitted to travel to UAE. The petitioner, even if it is construed to
be that he is the Director of the Company, the travel of a citizen
cannot be curtailed by the Bank on the ground that he is in default
of loan amount. Issuance of LOC has serious repercussions, first of
which is that he will not be able to move out of the shores of the
nation, notwithstanding any embargo placed by any Court of law.
15. The issue whether a LOC can be issued against a Director
of a Company against whom no proceedings are initiated or pending
before any Court of law is no longer res integra, as the Division
Bench of the High Court of Madras in the case of KARTI
P.CHIDAMBARAM v. BUREAU OF IMMIGRATION1 has held as
“62. In a Writ Petition (Crl) No. 1315 of 2008 being Sumer
Singh Salkan v. Assistant Director, the High Court of Delhi passed a
judgment and order dated 11.8.2010 formulating and answering
certain questions relating to issuance of Look Out Circulars for the
guidance of concerned agencies. In answer to the questions as
to what were the categories of cases in which the
Investigating agency could seek recourse to Look Out
Circular, and under what circumstances, the High Court held
that “recourse to Look Out Circular can be taken by the
Investigating agency in cognizable offences under Penal
Code, 1860 or other penal laws, where the accused was
deliberately evading arrest or not appearing in the trial
Court despite Non-Bailable warrant and other coercive
measures and there was likelihood of the accused leaving
the country to evade trial/arrest.”
63. Look Out Circulars are coercive measures to make
a person surrender to the Investigating agency or the Court
of law. In accordance with the order dated 26.7.2017 of the
High Court of Delhi, the Ministry of Home Affairs issued
Official Memorandum dated 27.10.2010 laying down the
guidelines for issuance of Look Out Circulars. The said Circular
“Recourse to Look Out Circular is to be taken in
cognizable offences under IPC or other penal laws. The
details in column IV in the enclosed proforma or regarding
reason for opening LOC's must invariably be provided
without which the subject of an LOC will not be
arrested/detained.”
64. The mandate of the Office Memorandum dated
27.10.2010, that a request for issuance of an LOC would
necessarily have to contain reasons for such request makes it clear
that the condition precedent for issuance of an LOC is the existence
of reasons, which should be disclosed in the request for issuance of
65. Pursuant to the directions of this Court, the respondents
have filed their counter affidavit. The counter affidavit does not
disclose the reasons for making a request for issuance of an LOC.
The impugned LOC is liable to be set aside on that ground alone.
66. Sections 41, 41-A and 41-B of the Code of Criminal
Procedure, 1973 are set out hereinafter for convenience:
“41. When police may arrest without warrant.—(1)
Any police officer may without an order from a Magistrate
and without a warrant, arrest any person—
(a)   who commits, in the presence of a police officer, a
cognizable offence;
(b)   against whom a reasonable complaint has been made,
or credible information has been received, or a
reasonable suspicion exists that he has committed a
cognizable offence punishable with imprisonment for a
term which may be less than seven years or which
may extend to seven years whether with or without
fine, if the following conditions are satisfied, namely:—
(i)     the police officer has reason to believe on the
basis of such complaint, information, or
suspicion that such person has committed the
(ii)    the police officer is satisfied that such arrest is
(a)   to prevent such person from committing any further
(b)   for proper investigation of the offence; or
(c)   to prevent such person from causing the evidence of
the offence to disappear or tampering with such
evidence in any manner; or
(d)   to prevent such person from making any inducement,
threat or promise to any person acquainted with the
facts of the case so as to dissuade him from disclosing
such facts to the Court or to the police officer; or
(e)   as unless such person is arrested, his presence in the
Court whenever required cannot be ensured, and the
police officer shall record while making such arrest, his
reasons in writing:
Provided that a police officer shall, in all cases where the
arrest of a person is not required under the provisions of this sub-
section, record the reasons in writing for not making the arrest.
(ba)      against whom credible information has been received
that he has committed a cognizable offence punishable
with imprisonment for a term which may extend to
more than seven years whether with or without fine or
with death sentence and the police officer has reason
to believe on the basis of that information that such
person has committed the said offence;
(c)   who has been proclaimed as an offender either under
this Code or by order of the State Government; or
(d)   in whose possession anything is found which may
reasonably be suspected to be stolen property and
who may reasonably be suspected of having
committed an offence with reference to such thing; or
(e)   who obstructs a police officer while in the execution of
his duty, or who has escaped, or attempts to escape,
from lawful custody; or
(f)   who is reasonably suspected of being a deserter from
any of the Armed Forces of the Union; or
(g)   who has been concerned in, or against whom a
reasonable complaint has been made, or credible
information has been received, or a reasonable
suspicion exists, of his having been concerned in, any
act committed at any place out of India which, if
committed in India, would have been punishable as an
offence, and for which he is, under any law relating to
extradition, or otherwise, liable to be apprehended or
detained in custody in India; or
(h)   who, being a released convict, commits a breach of
any rule made under sub-section (5) of section 356;
(i)   for whose arrest any requisition, whether written or
oral, has been received from another police officer,
provided that the requisition specifies the person to be
arrested and the offence or other cause for which the
arrest is to be made and it appears therefrom that the
person might lawfully be arrested without a warrant by
the officer who issued the requisition.
(2) Subject to the provisions of section 42, no person
concerned in a non-cognizable offence or against whom a complaint
has been made or credible information has been received or
reasonable suspicion exists of his having so concerned, shall be
arrested except under a warrant or order of a Magistrate.
41A. Notice of appearance before police officer.—(1) The
police officer shall], in all cases where the arrest of a person is not
required under the provisions of sub-section (1) of section 41, issue
a notice directing the person against whom a reasonable complaint
has been made, or credible information has been received, or a
reasonable suspicion exists that he has committed a cognizable
offence, to appear before him or at such other place as may be
specified in the notice.
(2)    Where such a notice is issued to any person, it shall be the
duty of that person to comply with the terms of the notice.
(3)    Where such person complies and continues to comply with
the notice, he shall not be arrested in respect of the offence
referred to in the notice unless, for reasons to be recorded,
the police officer is of the opinion that he ought to be
arrested.
(4)    Where such person, at any time, fails to comply with the
terms of the notice or is unwilling to identify himself, the
police officer may, subject to such orders as may have been
passed by a competent Court in this behalf, arrest him for
the offence mentioned in the notice.
41B. Procedure of arrest and duties of officer making
arrest.— Every police officer while making an arrest shall—
(a)     bear an accurate, visible and clear identification of his name
which will facilitate easy identification;
(b) prepare a memorandum of arrest which shall be—
(i)    attested by at least one witness, who is a member of
the family of the person arrested or a respectable
member of the locality where the arrest is made;
(ii)   countersigned by the person arrested; and
(c)    inform the person arrested, unless the memorandum is
attested by a member of his family, that he has a right to
have a relative or a friend named by him to be informed of
his arrest.”
67. Section 41(2) clearly provides that subject to the
provisions of Section 42, no person concerned in a non-cognizable
offence or against whom a complaint has been made or credible
information has been received or reasonable suspicion exists of his
having so concerned is to be arrested except under a warrant or
order of a Magistrate.
68. Section 42 provides for arrest of a person who in the
presence of a police officer, has committed or has been accused of
committing a non-cognizable offence refuses, on demand of such
officer to give his name and residence or gives a name or residence
which such officer has reason to believe to be false. Even in such
cases, when the true name and residence of such person have been
ascertained, he is to be released on his executing a bond with or
without sureties to appear before a Magistrate if so required.
69. The conditions precedent for arrest under Section 41 of
the Code of Criminal Procedure without warrant as set forth in sub-
sections (a) to (i) of Section 41(1) were wholly absent atleast as on
the date of issuance of the Look Out Circular. In any case, there
was no attempt to arrest the petitioner without warrant atleast as
on 15.06.2017 when notice under Section 41-A was issued to the
petitioner to appear before the Investigating officer on 29.6.2017.
A notice under Section 41A of the Criminal Procedure Code is
issued directing the accused to appear before the Investigating
Officer, when arrest of a person is not required, as observed by the
Supreme Court in Arnesh Kumar, supra.
70. The legality and/or validity of a Look Out Circular has to
be adjudged having regard to the circumstances prevailing on the
date on which the request for issuance of the Look Out Circular had
been made.
71. As observed above, the FIR against the petitioner was
lodged on 15.05.2017. Notice was issued on 15.6.2017 calling upon
the    petitioner    to   appear    before   the    Station   House
Officer/Investigation Officer on 29.6.2017. On the very next day
i.e., 16.6.2017, the impugned Look Out Circular was issued. As on
the date of issuance of the Look Out Circular, there could have
been no reason to suppose that the petitioner would not appear
before the Station House Officer/Investigation Officer.
72. On behalf of the respondents, it has been contended that
the petitioner did not appear on 29.6.2017 as directed, but only
appeared pursuant to the directions of the Supreme Court.
However, as argued by Mr. Subramanium, the very fact that after
issuance of the first notice dated 16.06.2017, which was returnable
on 29.06.2017, a further notice was issued on 04.07.2017 granting
the petitioner time till 21.07.2017, shows that there was no
immediate apprehension of his evading investigation, at least on
04.07.2017. There was, thus, no justification for issuance of the
impugned LOC on 16.06.2017, the validity whereof has expired, in
any case, after one year.
73. As observed above, the issuance of Look Out
Circulars is governed by executive instructions as contained
in the Office Memoranda Nos. 25022/13/78-F1 dated
05.09.1979 and 25022/20/98-FIV dated 27.12.2000, as
modified by Office Memorandum dated 27.10.2010. Such
LOCs cannot be issued as a matter of course, but when
reasons exist, where an accused deliberately evades arrest
or does not appear in the trial Court. The argument of the
learned Additional Solicitor General that a request for Look
Out Circular could have been made in view of the inherent
power of the investigating authority to secure attendance
and cooperation of an accused is contrary to the aforesaid
circulars and thus, not sustainable.
74. It is, in the view of this Court, too late in the day to
contend that whether or not to issue an LOC, being a
executive decision, the same is not subject to judicial
review. It is now well settled that any decision, be it
executive or quasi-judicial, is amenable to the power of
judicial review of the writ Court under Article 226 of the
Constitution of India, when such decision has adverse civil
consequences. An LOC, which is a coercive measure to make
a person surrender and consequentially interferes with his
right of personal liberty and free movement, certainly has
adverse civil consequences. This Court, therefore, holds that
in exercise of power of judicial review under Article 226 of
the Constitution, the writ Court can interfere with an LOC.
The question is whether the writ Court should exercise its
discretionary jurisdiction to interfere with the impugned
75. In view of the finding of this Court that the
conditions precedent for issuance of the impugned LOC were
absent, and the impugned LOC is liable to set aside on that
ground, we need not go into the questions of whether an
LOC could have been issued without statutory sanction, or
whether the respondents concerned had jurisdiction to issue
the impugned LOC. However, in our view, the Look Out
Circular was issued in hot haste when the conditions
precedent for issuance of such Circular did not exist. The
impugned Look Out Circular is, thus, liable to be set aside.
76. For the reasons discussed above, the impugned LOC is
set aside and quashed. It is made clear that the order of this Court
setting aside the impugned LOC will not impact the criminal
proceedings initiated pursuant to the FIR, referred to above, or any
other proceedings initiated against the petitioner.”

After the judgment in the case of KARTI P.CHIDAMBARAM
(supra) a fresh set of guidelines are issued by the Union of India.
Those guidelines are the ones extracted hereinabove. After the new
guidelines coming into force, the Delhi High Court has in the
judgment of RANA AYYUB v. UNION OF INDIA2                    has held as
“12. In the particular facts of the case, it becomes
evident that the LOC was issued in haste and despite the
absence of any precondition necessitating such a measure.
An LOC is a coercive measure to make a person surrender
and consequentially interferes with petitioner's right of
personal liberty and free movement. It is to be issued in
cases    where     the    accused      is  deliberately   evading
summons/arrest or where such person fails to appear in
Court despite a Non-Bailable Warrant. In the instant case,
there is no contradiction by the respondent to the
submission of the petitioner that she has appeared on each
and every date before the Investigating Agency when
summoned, and hence, there is no cogent reason for
presuming that the Petitioner would not appear before the
Investigation Agency and hence, no case is made out for
issuing the impugned LOC.
13. The impugned LOC is accordingly liable to be set
aside as being devoid of merits as well as for infringing the
Human right of the Petitioner to travel abroad and to
exercise her freedom of speech and expression. For the
reasons discussed above, the impugned LOC is set aside and
quashed. However, a balance has to be struck qua the right
of the investigation agency to investigate the instant matter
as well as the fundamental right of the petitioner of
movement and free speech.
14. Therefore, the instant petition stands allowed in above
terms with the conditions that follow hereunder:
(a)   The petitioner shall intimate her travel dates and
detailed itinerary to the Investigation Agency
forthwith along with the address of the places that the
petitioner shall be visiting;
(b)   The petitioner shall deposit an FDR to the tune of Rs. 1 lakh
before the Enforcement Directorate at Mumbai;
(c)   The petitioner shall not attempt to tamper with the evidence
or influence the witnesses in any manner;
(d)   The petitioner shall return to India on the date specified i.e.
11th April 2022; and
(e)   The petitioner shall give an undertaking to appear before the
Investigation Agency immediately on her return and on dates
that might be fixed by the Investigation Agency for
interrogation, if any, after the travel period.”

The High Court of Delhi in the case of RANA AYYUB holds that the
LOC is issued against the petitioner therein in the hottest haste as
he is not the accused in any crime so registered. The Delhi High
Court holds that personal liberty to travel cannot be taken away
except in accordance with law permits travel of the petitioner
therein.   In the light of the afore-quoted judgments of the High
Court of Madras and the High Court of Delhi what would
unmistakably emerge is, taking recourse to LOC against persons
like the petitioner if they have a role to play in the alleged episode
of default of payment of loan to the tune of several crores. But, the
issue would be whether the 2nd respondent/Bank has demonstrated
that the petitioner has any role to play in the borrowal account and
the default.
16. All that the petitioner is now asking is, travel to UAE and
Saudi Arabia for the purpose of business and seeks back to the
shores of the nation. It is his grievance that the LOC has come in
his way.    Therefore, in the peculiar facts of this case, I deem it
appropriate to permit the petitioner to travel for a brief period and
come back to the shores of the nation, after conclusion of his work
at UAE and Saudi Arabia. This direction is apt to be issued in the
light of the fact that the petitioner is not an accused in any crime
registered except the recovery proceedings before the Debts
Recovery Tribunal, Bengaluru where he is not a party to the
17. For the aforesaid reasons, I pass the following:
(i)       Writ Petition is disposed.
(ii)   The petitioner is authorized to travel to United Arab
Emirates and Saudi Arabia for a brief period, which is
made subject to filing an affidavit of undertaking
before this Court that he would complete his work
and come back to the shores of the nation within the
time as indicated in the said affidavit from the date
he starts his journey. The affidavit of undertaking
shall be filed before the Registry of this Court, within
one week from today.
(iii)  The affidavit of undertaking once filed would be in
force so long as the current LOC issued by the 2nd
respondent is operating.
(iv)   The petitioner shall intimate his date of travel and
arrival   to   the   originating  agency    who    shall
communicate it to the Bureau of Immigration on
every occasion. It is not permission but information.
Such information is to be given by the petitioner so
long as the LOC is in operation.
Consequently, pending applications also stand disposed.
