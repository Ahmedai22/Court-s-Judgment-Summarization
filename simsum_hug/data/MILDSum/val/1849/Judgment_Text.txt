(F) Your Lordships be pleased to pass such other and further orders

2      The facts giving rise to this writ application may be summarized as
3      The writ applicant before us is an Insurance Company. One Motor
Accident Claim Petition bearing No.518 of 1999 came to be filed in the
City Civil Court at Ahmedabad. The said claim petition came to be
allowed by the MACT (Aux.) Judge, City Civil Court, Ahmedabad, vide
judgement and award dated 18th January 2017.
4      The operative part of the order passed by the Tribunal in the
above referred MACP reads thus:
“(a) The petitioners in MACP No. 518/1999 do recover Rs. 16.28,008/-
(Rs. Sixteen lacs twenty-eight thousand eight only) from the opponent
1, 2 and 3 jointly and/or severally, together with running interest at the
rate of 8% p.a from the date of petition till realization of the amount
along with proportionate costs of the petition.
(b) The opponents are directed to follow the ratio laid down in the
judgment of Hansgauri P. Ladhani V Oriental Ins. Co. Ltd, reported in
2007-GLH-2-291 as far as TDS is concerned".
5      Thus, the Insurance Company was directed to deposit the amount
as awarded with interest and so far as the TDS was concerned, the
Insurance Company was directed to follow the decision of this High
Court rendered in the case of Hansaguri Prafulchandra Ladhani and
others vs. The Oriental Insurance Company Ltd rendered in 2007 ACJ
6      The writ applicant herein in due compliance of the judgement and
award passed by the Tribunal, deposited the entire amount along with
the TDS. The TDS to the tune of Rs.2,21,516/- was deposited through a
cheque on 26th May 2017.
7      The deposit of the TDS referred to above was in accordance with
the judgement of this High Court in the case of Hansaguri (supra).
8      It appears that thereafter, the original claimants preferred a
Miscellaneous Application No.298 of 2017 before the Motor Accident
Claim Tribunal, City Civil Court at Ahmedabad with a prayer to release
the amount of Rs.2,21,516/- deducted towards the TDS as referred to
9      The Miscellaneous Application came to be partly allowed by the
Tribunal vide order dated 4th August 2018, which reads thus:
1. The present application has been given by the applicants to release
the amount of Rs.2,21,516/- deducted towards TDS which has been
deposited in the Tribunal vide 'C' No.521, on 26.05.2017.
2. Against the afore stated application, Advocate for the Insurance Co.
has made an endorsement stating that he has no objection for
withdrawal as no appeal or review has been filed by the Insurance Co.
3. Considering the papers on record, it transpires that the Tribunal has
passed an order in MACP No.518/1999 on 18.01.2017, allowing the
said petition and award of Rs.16,28,008/- was passed. The Insurance
Co. has deposited the awarded amount with the Interest and had
deducted the amount of Rs.2,21,516/- being the amount of TDS out of
the interest amount. As regards the aforestated amount of TDS is
concerned, no dispute has been raised by the applicant and they have
also admitted that the amount deducted towards TDS is proper.
4. As far as the aforestated amount is concerned, the said amount is
deposited as Tax in the income-tax department but the Insurance Co.
said amount has deposited the in the court. So, the said amount is
required to be sent back to the insurance Co. for depositing the same
with the Income Tax department and in my view it cannot be given to
the applicants. So, considering the peculiar facts and circumstance on
hand, this application is required to be partly allowed and in the
interest of justice I pass the following order.
The present application is hereby partly allowed.
The Registry is hereby directed to send back the amount of Rs.
2,21,516/- deposited vide 'C' No.521, dated 18.05.2017, to the Oriental
Insurance Co. Ltd. with a direction that the Insurance Co. shall deposit
the said amount with the Income Tax department and then after would
produce the necessary document regarding the same to this Court and
supply the same to the applicants.
The Insurance Co. Is further directed to follow the procedure
regarding depositing the amount of TDS with the Income Tax
department and issue the necessary certificate along with the relevant
papers of depositing the amount to the applicants and the copy be send
to this Court.
10    Thus, in view of the aforesaid order passed by the Tribunal, the
writ applicant deposited the TDS amount with the Income Tax
Department on 26th March 2019 and also filed correction statement for
26Q for the Q-1 of F. Y. 2017-18, which resulted in the demand of
interest of Rs.69,741/- under Section 201(1A) of the Income Tax Act,
11     It appears that the directions issued by the Tribunal as above were
challenged by the writ applicant herein by filing the Special Civil
Application No.10060 of 2019 on 10th June 2019.
12     The Insurer filed an application dated 19 th June 2019 with the
Income Tax Department requesting waiver of the additional late
payment interest of Rs.69741/- against processing of the latest
correction statement for the F. Y. 2017-18.
13     The writ applicant herein also preferred an application to implead
the Income Tax Department in the Special Civil Application No.10060 of
14     A learned Single Judge of this Court, vide order dated 30 th August
2019, directed that no coercive steps shall be taken against the
Insurance Company till the issue of TDS was not set at rest.
15     It appears that although this Court had passed an interim order in
the Special Civil Application No.10060 of 2019 as above, yet the Income
Tax Department proceeded to pass an order dated 22 nd January 2021,
whereby the department rejected the application filed by the Insurer
seeking waiver of interest for the late deposit of the TDS amount.
16     In such circumstances referred to above, the writ applicant –
Insurance Company has come up with the present writ application.
17     Mr. Rathin Raval, the learned counsel appearing for the Insurance
Company submitted that this litigation raised many issues of public
importance. He pointed out that the practice of deducting tax at source
(TDS) on interest under Section 194A of the Income Tax Act is on the
basis of the ratio of the decision of this High Court in the case of
Hansaguri (supra). According to Mr. Raval, Hansaguri (supra) is based
on the decision of the Supreme Court rendered in the case of Rama Bai
vs. CIT (1990) 181 ITR 400 (SC), wherein the Supreme Court held that
the interest as awarded by the Tribunal shall first spread over the
relevant F. Y. covering the period for which the interest is granted. It is
only if the interest for any particular financial year exceeds Rs.50,000/-,
the amount would be liable to be deducted at source and shall have to
be deposited with the MACT.
18     Mr. Raval submitted that the Finance Act, 2015 has inserted new
Section 194A(3) (ixa) with effect from 1st June 2015. The effect of the
amendment is as under:
“(1) No liability for TDS shall be attracted in respect of any income
credited by way of interest on the compensation amount awarded by
the MACT.
(2) Such liability for deduction of tax in respect of interest on
compensation will be attracted, only at the time of actual payment and
only if the amount of such payment or aggregate amounts of such
payments during a financial year exceeds Rs. 50,000/-.”
19     Mr. Raval pointed out that in view of the aforesaid amendment to
Section 194A, the TDS would have to be deducted out of the actual
payment of interest on compensation. The rate would be 10% if the
claimants had produced the PAN Card before the payment and 20% if
the PAN Card had not been produced. Mr. Raval would submit that in
spite of the aforesaid amendment, the Insurance Companies are being
compelled to deposit the amount with the Tribunal itself. The Tribunal
would thereafter decide accordingly.
20     In such circumstances referred to above, Mr. Raval prays that this
Court may clarify the issue by explaining the correct position of law as
regards the liability of the Insurance Company to deduct the TDS and
deposit the same with the Tribunal; or with the Income Tax Department.
21     Per contra, Mr. M. R. Bhatt, the learned Senior Counsel appearing
for the Revenue submitted that the writ applicant – Insurance Company
was not justified in depositing the TDS with the City Civil Court instead
of the Income Tax Department. Mr. Bhatt would submit that there is no
ambiguity or confusion as regards the question as to where the TDS is
required to be deposited. According to Mr. Bhatt, the provisions of
and 200 resply of the Income Tax Act make the legal position
abundantly clear.
22     Mr. Bhatt would submit that the Insurance Company is liable to
deduct the TDS on the interest paid by it in accordance with the
provisions of Section 194A(3)(ix) and (ixa) of the Act and if the assessee
is of the view that tax has been deducted in excess, then he can always
claim refund of the same from the Income Tax Department.
23     Mr. Bhatt has also filed a note explaining the position of Section
194A post amendment. Mr. Bhatt has also discussed few judgements on
the issue in question including Hansaguri (supra). The same reads thus:
“As per Section 194A of Income Tax Act, 1961, when any person not
being an individual or HUF who becomes responsible for paying to a
resident any income by way of interest other than income by way of
interest on securities. shall at time of credit of such income to the
account of the payee or at the time of payment thereof in cash or by
issue of a cheque or draft or by any other mode, whichever is earlier,
deduct income tax thereon at the rates in force. Sub-section (3)
excludes the application of sub-section (1) sub-clause (ix) thereof and
provides that the provisions of sub-section (1) shall not apply to such
income credited or paid by way of interest on the compensation
awarded by the Motor Accident Claims Tribunal, where amount of such
income or, as case may be, aggregate of the amounts of such income
paid during financial year does not exceed Rs.50,000/. Thus, for
exemption from provisions of Sub-section (1) of Section 194A, such
income paid by way of interest on compensation amount awarded by
Tribunal will not be liable for tax if aggregate amount of such interest
income paid during financial year does not exceed Rs.50,000/- .
        Relevant provisions are reproduced for ready reference:
194A. Interest other than "Interest on securities".
(1) Any person, not being an individual or a Hindu undivided family,
who is responsible for paying to a resident any income by way of
interest other than income by way of interest on securities, shall, at the
time of credit of such income to the account of the payee or at the time
of payment thereof in cash or by issue of a cheque or draft or by any
other mode, whichever is earlier. deduct income-tax thereon at the
Provided that an individual or a Hindu undivided family, whose total
sales, gross receipts or turnover from the business or profession carried
on by him exceed [one crore rupees in case of business or fifty lakh
rupees in case of profession] during the financial year immediately
preceding the financial year in which such interest is credited or paid,
shall be liable to deduct income-tax under this section.]
Explanation - For the purposes of this section, where any income by
way of interest as aforesaid is credited to any account, whether called
"Interest payable account" or "Suspense account" or by any other name,
in the books of account of the person liable to pay such income, such
crediting shall be deemed to be credit of such income to the account of
the payee and the provisions of this section shall apply accordingly.
(3) The provisions of sub-section (1) shall not apply
(ix) to such income credited by way of interest on the
compensation amount awarded by the Motor Accidents Claims
(ixa) to such income paid by way of interest on the
compensation amount awarded by the Motor Accidents Claims
Tribunal where the amount of such income or, as the case may
be, the aggregate of the amounts of such income paid during the
financial year does not exceed fifty thousand rupees;
145B. Taxability of certain income.
(1) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in section 145,
the interest received by an assessee on any compensation or on
enhanced compensation, as the case may be, shall be deemed to be the
income of the previous year in which it is received.
(2) Any claim for escalation of price in a contract or export incentives
shall be deemed to be the income of the previous year in which
reasonable certainty of its realisation is achieved.
(3) The income referred to in sub-clause (xviii) of clause (24) of section
2 shall be deemed to be the income of the previous year in which it is
received, if not charged to income-tax in any earlier previous year.
56. Income from other sources.
(1) Income of every kind which is not to be excluded from the total
income under this Act shall be chargeable to income-tax under the head
from other sources", if it is not chargeable to income-tax under any of
the heads specified in section 14, items A to E.
(2) In particular, and without prejudice to the generality of the
provisions of sub-section (1), the following incomes, shall be chargeable
to income-tax under the head "Income from other sources", namely :

24     Having regard to the important issues we are called upon to
decide, we also took the assistance of the learned Senior Counsel Mr.
Tushar Hemani and also the learned counsel Mr. Bandish Soparkar.
25     While the writ applicant – Insurance Company seeks a declaration
from this Court with regard to the non-applicability of the decision of
Hansaguri (supra); the issue is inherently linked with the question
whether the interest awarded by the MACT is chargeable to the income
tax in the first place. Only if it is found chargeable, then the question
would arise as to in what manner should the writ applicant – Insurance
Company deduct the tax and deposit with the Tribunal or the Income
Tax Department. If the interest awarded by the MACT is not chargeable
to income tax, then there would be no occasion for the Insurance
Company to deduct the tax.
26     In view of the aforesaid, the following questions fall for our
(i) Whether interest allowed by the MACT in the accident case on
the amount of award can be termed as the 'Income from interest'
or the same is a part of compensation for the delay caused in the
(ii) Whether interest allowed on the compensation amount can be
equated with interest earned on the principal amount?
(iii) Whether the interest awarded by the MACT is not a part of
27     Before we proceed to answer the aforesaid question, we must look
into few provisions of law.
28     Section 2(28A) of the Income Tax Act defines the term “interest”.
“(28A) “interest” means interest payable in any manner in respect of
any moneys borrowed or debt incurred (including a deposit, claim or
other similar right or obligation) and includes any service fee or other
charge in respect of the moneys borrowed or debt incurred or in respect
of any credit facility which has not been utilised;”
29     Section 56(2)(viii) of the Income Tax Act is with regard to
“income from other sources”. The same reads thus:
“Income from other sources.
(2) In particular, and without prejudice to the generality of the
provisions of sub-section (1), the following incomes, shall be chargeable
to income-tax under the head “Income from other sources”, namely-
(viii) income by way of interest received on compensation or on
enhanced compensation referred to in [sub-section (1) of section
30     Section 194A(3)(ix) and (ixa) of the Income Tax Act is with
regard to “interest other than interest on securities”. The same reads
“Interest other than “Interest on securities.
(3) The provisions of sub-section (1) shall not apply -
(ix) to such income credited by way of interest on the compensation
amount awarded by the Motor Accidents Claims Tribunal.
(ixa) To such income paid by way of interest on the compensation
amount awarded by the Motor Accidents Claims Tribunal where the
amount of such income or, as the case may be, the aggregate of the
amounts of such income paid during the financial year does not exceed
fifty thousand rupees;”
31     Section 145B(1) of the Income Tax Act is with regard to
“taxability of certain income”. The same reads thus:
“Taxability of certain income.
145B. (1) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
section-145, the interest received by an assessee on any compensation
or on enhanced compensation, as the case may be, shall be deemed to
be the income of the previous year in which it is received.
(2) Any claim for escalation of price in a contract or export incentives
shall be deemed to be the income of the previous year in which
reasonable certainty of its realisation is achieved.
(3) The income referred to in sub-clause (xviii) of clause (24) of
section-2 shall be deemed to be the income of the previous year in
which it is received, if not charged to income-tax in any earlier previous
year.”
32     Section 171 of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 reads thus:
“171. Award of interest where any claim is allowed.— Where any
Claims Tribunal allows a claim for compensation made under this Act,
such Tribunal may direct that in addition to the amount of
compensation simple interest shall also be paid at such rate and from
such date not earlier than the date of making the claim as it may specify
in this behalf.
33     Section 28 and Section 34 resply of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894
“Section 28. Collector may be directed to pay interest on excess
compensation. If the sum which, in the opinion of the Court, the
Collector ought to have awarded as compensation is in excess of the
sum which the Collector did award as compensation, the award of the
Court may direct that the Collector shall pay interest on such excess at
the rate of [nine per centum] per annum from the date on which he
took possession of the land to the date of payment of such excess into
Provided that the award of the Court may also direct that where
such excess or any part thereof is paid into Court after the date of
expiry of a period of one year from the date on which possession is
taken, interest at the rate of fifteen per centum per annum shall be
payable from the date of expiry of the said period of one year on the
amount of such excess or part thereof which has not been paid into
Court before the date of such expiry.”
“Section 34. Payment of interest. When the amount of such
compensation is not paid or deposited on or before taking possession of
the land, the Collector shall pay the amount awarded with interest
thereon at the rate of [nine per centum] per annum from the time of so
taking possession until it shall have been so paid or deposited:
Provided that if such compensation or any part thereof is not
paid or deposited within a period of one year from the date on which
possession is taken, interest at the rate of fifteen per centum per annum
shall be payable from the date of expiry of the said period of one year
on the amount of compensation or part thereof which has not been paid
or deposited before the date of such expiry.”
34     In Rama Bai (supra), the Supreme Court held that the arrears
towards interest computed on delayed or enhanced compensation under
Section 28 or Section 34 of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894 shall be
taxable on accrual basis from year to year basis and not at one go – in
the year of actual receipt of the award.
35     In 2003, Section 194A(3)(ix) came to be inserted to prescribe that
on credit or payment of interest awarded by the MACT exceeding
Rs.50,000/-, TDS is required.
36     In Hansaguri (supra), the applicant claimed before this High Court
that the amount of interest awarded by the MACT should be spread
across the different claimants as well as across the different years.
Following Rama Bai (supra), a Coordinate Bench of this Court held that
the interest would be spread over different years and if thereafter, if it
exceeds Rs.50,000/- in any year, then for that year to year, the TDS
would be liable to be deducted.
37     In 2009, by Finance (No.2) Act, 2009, Section 145A(b) and
Section 56(2)(viii) came to be amended and with the same, Rama Bai
(supra) got diluted. Two sections came to be amended to provide that so
far as the interest on delayed or enhanced compensation (under the
Land Acquisition Act, 1894) was concerned, the same was taxable only
in the year of receipt and would not be spread over the years.
38     The Finance Act, 2015 amended Section 194A(3) to divide it into
(ix) said that in relation to only credit, no TDS is required.
(ixa) said that in relation to payment, if it is less than 50,000/-,
then no TDS.
The aforesaid was done to rationalise Section 194A so as to give
effect of the earlier amendment of 2009 which said that the taxability of
interest would arise only in the year of receipt and therefore, in the years
of its accrual there was no tax incidence. Therefore, to that extent the
194A(3)(ix) was inconsistent and was accordingly corrected.
39     In 2016, one another judgement came to be delivered by this High
Court in the case of New India Assurance Co. Limited vs. Bhoyabhai
Haribhai Bharvad reported in 2017 ACJ 1727. In the case of Bhoyabhai
(supra), the Insurance Company had deducted tax and deposited with
the Income Tax Department. The claimant asserted that the total sum
without deduction should have been deposited with the Tribunal itself.
This Court examined the issue keeping the amended Section 194A in
mind (but not Section 145A(b)) and proceeded to take the view on facts
that none of the spread overs the ceiling of Rs.50,000/- was breached
and therefore, the Insurance Company ought to have deducted the tax.
We quote the relevant observations:
“9. Sub section (3) of Section 194A, however, includes those cases
which would be excluded from the purview of sub section (1). Relevant
portion of sub section (3) as its stood prior to 01.06.2015 amendment

be, the aggregate of the amounts of such income credited or paid

Ladhani and ors vs. The Oriental Insurance Company Ltd (supra) had
occasion to interpret this provision. W.e.f. 01.06.2015, however, this
Clause (ix) of sub section (3) of Section 194A has been omitted and is
replaced by Clauses (ix) and (ixa) which read as under:
“(ix) to such income credited by way of interest on the
compensation amount awarded by the Motor Accidents Claims
Tribunal; (ixa) to such income paid by way of interest on the
compensation amount awarded by the Motor Accident Claims
Tribunal where the amount of such income or, as the case may
be, the aggregate of the amounts of such income paid during the
financial year does not exceed fifty thousand rupees.”
11. Under Clause (ix) to sub section (3) of Section 194A of the Act, as it
originally stood, requirement of deducting tax at source under sub
section (1) would not apply in a case where any income is credited or
paid by way of interest on compensation amount awarded by Motor
Accident Claims Tribunal where the amount of such income or, the
aggregate amounts of such income credited or paid during the financial
year does not exceed fifty thousand rupees. This provision of Clause
(ix) is now divide into two parts and is replaced by Clauses (ix) and
(ixa). Clause (ix), in the present form, refers to such income credited by
way of interest on the compensation amount awarded by the Claims
Tribunal. The case of crediting of interest on compensation therefore,
would fall in Clause (ix) as it stands currently. Under Clause (ixa)
would fall, any payment of interest on compensation awarded by the
Claims Tribunal where the amount of such income or the aggregate
paid during the financial year does not exceed fifty thousand rupees.
12. It would, therefore, be wholly incorrect to read the current
provision of sub section (3) of Section 194A to argue that the cases of
income credited by way of interest on compensation awarded by the
Claims Tribunal is no longer part of sub section (3) for exclusion from
purview of sub section (1) of Section 194A. In other words, worded
slightly differently. The case of credit of interest on compensation
awarded by the Claims Tribunal continues to find place in the exclusion
clause contained in sub section (3) of Section 194A. In fact, it would
prima facie appear that the ceiling of Rs. 50,000/- per annum for such
exclusion is now done away with in case of crediting of interest on
compensation awarded by the Claims Tribunal while retaining such
limit in cases of payment of interest on such compensation. However,
we need not thresh out this last part of the issue since admittedly, in
the present case, for none of the years under consideration, the interest
income exceeded Rs. 50,000/-. In fact, this Court in case of Smt.
Hansagauri Prafulchandra Ladhani and ors vs. The Oriental Insurance
Company Ltd (supra) provided for further splitting up of this ceiling of
Rs. 50,000/- per claimant basis. Looked from any angle, the insurance
company was not justified in deducting tax at source while depositing
the compensation in favour of the claimants. It therefore, cannot avoid
liability of depositing such amount with the Claims Tribunal. The
Claims Tribunal had committed no error in insisting on the insurance
company in making good the shortfall.
13. At this stage, learned counsel for the petitioner drew our attention
to the order dated 05.03.2012 passed by this Court in Civil Application
No. 2592 of 2012, in which, the insurance company had deposited with
the Income Tax Department a sum of Rs. 7, 91, 971/- by way of tax on
compensation of Rs. 34,39,070/- awarded by the Claims Tribunal. This
Court allowed the claimants to seek refund of such amount from the
Income Tax department and permitted the insurance company to
receive it back from the claimants as and when such refund would be
made by the Income Tax department. However, in the present case, we
are not inclined to accept such a formula. Firstly, the amount in
question is not very large. Secondly, in order to provide for such
formula, we would have to call upon the claimants to appear before us,
a luxury which poor litigants can ill-afford. Thirdly, the insurance
company should have properly adviced itself before effecting tax at
source on the ground that the judgement of this Court in case of Smt.
Hansagauri Prafulchandra Ladhani and ors vs. The Oriental Insurance
Company Ltd (supra) was no longer good law in view of the statutory
amendments. Not having done that the only course left open to the
insurance company would be to approach the Income Tax department
for refund, as may be adviced.”
40     In the Finance Act, 2021, the erstwhile Section 145A(b) is now
41     The case of the Revenue is that the legislative intent in insertion of
Section 145A(b) is very clear. According to the Revenue, the interest
received on any compensation or enhanced compensation is deemed to
be income of the assessee in the year of its receipt after the insertion of
Section 145A(b). The ratio of Rama Bai (supra) stands overruled by
Section 145A(b) and therefore, to that extent, even Hansaguri (supra) is
not relevant after the insertion of Section 145A(b). According to the
Revenue, the interest received as a part of the award is deemed to be
income in the year of its receipt and is not to be accounted across many
years under the accrual system.
42     According to the Revenue, such interest income is liable to the
TDS under Section 194A(3)(ixa) if it exceeds Rs.50,000/- for any
claimant at the time of its deposit by the Insurance Company with the
43     The stance of the Revenue is that Bhoyabhai (supra) failed to take
notice of the amendment in Section 145A(b) and thereby ordered to
spread over the ceiling of Rs.50,000/- over years.
44     The stance of the Revenue is that whenever any Insurance
Company would deposit the amount with the Tribunal, at that time, if
the total sum deposited exceeds Rs.50,000/- for any claimant, then for
that claimant, tax is required to be deducted.
45     Section 171 of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 empowers the
Tribunal to award interest on the claim made under the Motor Vehicles
Act from the date of making the claim. Sections 28 and 34 resply of the
Land Acquisition Act, 1894 relate to the interest on compensation for the
land compulsorily acquired and the compensation received for.
46     It is very essential to bear the fine distinction between the interest
awarded under the two enactments viz. the Motor Vehicles Act,1988 and
the Land Acquisition Act, 1894 resply. There are few amendments
brought under the Income Tax Act keeping a specific law (Land
Acquisition Act, 1894) in mind. Various High Courts have taken the view
that the treatment of all the three Sections 28, & 34 resply of the Land
Acquisition Act and Section 171 of the Motor Vehicles Act interest is not
the same so far as taxability under the Income Tax Act is concerned.
47     The amendment in Section 145A(b) only creates a deeming fiction
as to the year of taxability of the interest on compensation. It does not
create a deeming fiction as to the taxability of the interest on
compensation. Even after the insertion of Section 145A(b), the interest
on compensation under the Motor Vehicles Act which is exempt does not
become taxable by operation of Section 145A(b).
48     The compensation received under the compulsory acquisition of
land is in any case taxable under Section 45 as the Capital Gains and
therefore, the issue under the Land Acquisition with regard to interest
under Sections 28 and 34 i.e limited to the extent that the same would
be taxable under Section 56(2)(viii) (Section 34 interest) or Section 45
the Capital Gains (Section 28 interest that is part of the compensation)
and therefore, only the year of its taxability is decided by Section
145A(b) and not the taxability of interest on the compulsory acquisition
of land. Whereas under the Motor Vehicles Act, the compensation itself
is exempt. The nature of interest, therefore, would assume significance
and cannot be given the same treatment as interest on compensation
under the Land Acquisition Act and be taxed by operation of Section
49     It is crucial to note that in Rama Bai (supra), the Supreme Court
drew no distinction between the interest under Section 28 and interest
under Section 34 of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894. Later in Ghanshyam
(2009) 315 ITR 1 (SC), the Supreme Court drew this distinction and
held that the interest under Section 28 of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894
would form part of the compensation itself and is taxable under the
capital gain only. The amendment of Section 145A(b), Sections 56(2)
(viii) and 194A resply would therefore not apply to the interest under
Section 28 of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894, but would apply only to
Section 34 interest as is held in the case of [2016] 388 ITR 343
(Gujarat) Movaliya Bhikhubhai Balabhai. Therefore, the implication of
Sections 145A(b) is not absolute even with respect to the interest
awarded under Section 28 of the Land Acquisition Act and cannot apply
to the interest awarded by the MACT as well.
50      The term “income” is inclusively defined in Section 2(24). Such
definition does not include the “interest” referred to in the Section 56(2)
(viii) or interest received in the MACT award.
51      The words of Section 194A(3) are crucial i.e “income by way of
interest” and not simply “interest”. Therefore, even when interest is paid,
if the same is received not in the name of “income”, then Section
194A(3) would not operate.
52      Therefore, the interest on compensation not being taxable at all
there is no question of deducting tax on the same under Section 194(A).
53      In Hansaguri (supra), the Court had no occasion to examine the
taxability of the interest which proceeded on the basis that it is taxable.
Therefore, now if it is held to be exempt, the guidelines prescribed in
Hansaguri (supra) are no longer applicable. The Insurance Company
must deposit the full award before the Tribunal without deducting tax
and the same is to be disbursed to the claimants.
54     The existing provisions of the Income Tax Act provide that the
income chargeable under the head “Profits and gains of business or
profession” or “Income from other sources”, shall be computed in
accordance with either cash or mercantile system of accounting
regularly employed by the assessee. Further, the Supreme Court, in the
case of Rama Bai (supra) has held that arrears of interest computed on
delayed or enhanced compensation shall be taxable on accrual basis.
This has caused undue hardship to the taxpayers. With a view to
mitigating the hardships, it is proposed to amend Section 145A to
provide that the interest received by an assessee on compensation or
enhanced compensation shall be deemed to be his income for the year in
which it is received, irrespective of the method of accounting followed
by the assessee. Further, it is proposed to insert clause (viii) in sub-
section (2) of Section 56 to provide that income by way of interest
received on compensation or on enhanced compensation referred to in
sub-section (2) of Section 145A shall be assessed as “income from other
sources” in the year in which it is received. This amendment will take
effect from 1st April 2010 and shall accordingly apply in relation to the
assessment year 1998-99 and subsequent assessment years. [Clauses 26,
55     Under Section 194(3)(ix) of the Act, tax is not required to be
deducted from the interest or paid on the compensation amount
awarded by the Motor Accident Claim Tribunal if the amount of such
interest credited or paid during a financial year does not exceed
Rs.50,000/-. Finance (No.2) Act, 2009 amended the provisions of
Section 56 of the Act as well as substituted Section 145A of the Act to,
inter alia, provide that interest income received on compensation or
enhanced compensation shall be deemed to be the income of the year in
which the same has been received. However, the existing provisions of
Section 194A of the Act provide for deduction of tax from the interest
paid or credited on compensation, whichever is earlier. Section 145A(b)
of the Act provides an exception to the method of accounting contained
in Section 145 of the Act and mandates for taxation of interest on
compensation on receipt basis only. Therefore, deduction of tax on such
interest on mercantile / accrual basis results into undue hardship and
mismatch. It is, therefore, proposed to amend the provisions of Section
194A of the Income Tax Act, 1961 to provide that deduction of tax
under Section 194A of the Act from the interest payment on the
compensation amount awarded by the Motor Accident Claim Tribunal
compensation shall be made only at the time of payment, if the amount
of such payment or aggregate amount of such payments during a
financial year exceeds Rs.50,000/-. These amendments will take effect
56     We are of the view that compensation under the award of the
MACT is not income. The expression “income” used in the Entry 82 of
List I of Seventh Schedule to the Constitution can be given widest
meaning. Under Section 2(24), the definition is inclusive and not
exhaustive. In the absence of any express provision to the contrary,
income can be held to refer to something earned. What is received as
compensation for loss in one or the other form may not be income.
57     It was observed in the Commissioner of Income Tax, Bengal Vs.
Shaw Wallace and Company [AIR 1932 Privy Council 138] by the Privy
“The object of the Indian Act is to tax “income” a term which it does not
define. It is expanded, no doubt, into income, profits and gains,” but
the expansion is more a matter of words than of substance, Income,
their Lordships think, in this cannotes a periodical monetary return
“coming in” with some sort of regularity, or expected regularity, from
definite sources. The source is not necessary one which is expected to
be continuously productive, but it must be one whose object is the
production of a definite return, excluding anything in the nature of a
mere windfall. Thus income has been likened pictorially to the fruit of a
tree, or the crop of a field. It is essential the produce of something,
which is often loosely spoken of as “capital”. But capital, though
possibly the source in the case of income from securities, is in most
cases hardly more than an element in the process of production.”
58    In Rani Amrit Kunwar Vs. Commissioner of Income Tax, C. P. &
U.P. (1946) XIV ITR 561, the Allahabad High Court observed:-
“Under Indian law, therefore, we come back in my opinion, to the
relatively simple test whether in the ordinary parlance of language
what the assessee receives is “income” or not. I should not dream of
suggesting that every payment made by one person to another is
necessarily the recipient's income since it may, as Viscount Dunedin has
said, be merely a casual payment or, as Sir George Lowndes has
suggested, a mere windfall. Such sweeping proposition would be
absurd. Many things have to be considered. In the case of a payment by
a parent to a child or by a husband to a wife or by one relation to
another obvious questions arise whether in the particular circumstances
of each case the payments are made in such a way as to constitute what
is paid the money of the recipient at all or whether the payments
themselves are not merely a series of casual payments or windfalls. But
there seems to me to be another class of cases altogether in which in
particular circumstances payments may be made by one person to
another which can only be explained on the ground that the giver
intends to give, and the recipient expects to receive, with regularity or
expected regularity and from a source the nature of which is to produce
such a payment, an “income” which is in the income-tax sense his own.
I can find nothing in the Indian Income-tax Act to warrant any general
conclusion that it is only in a case in which, if the payment is
discontinued, the recipient will have an immediate right of action
against the payer, that it will be income in his hands in the Indian
income-tax sense. That is to put too limited a construction on the word
“income.” If the payments are such as to come within the category of
payments which are casual and nonrecurring, then it is to be observed
that the Act itself has taken them out of the category of “income”. The
very fact that the framers of the Indian Income-tax Act found it
necessary by a special clause to exempt casual and non-recurring
receipts from the category of income, profits and gains is itself, in my
opinion, an indication that, but for that exemption, they are to be
regarded as capable of falling within the class of income, profits or
gains under the charging section. If it is to be assumed that ex
hypothesi a casual and nonrecurring payment could never be income,
then, as I see it, the statutory exception of it would be otiose and
unnecessary. Another reason is afforded by Section 4 (3)(ii) of the
Income-tax Act for inducing me to think that so narrow a construction
cannot be placed on the word “income”. If the assessee were right in
saying that the test of “obligation” has in all cases to be applied in
deciding what is or is not “income”, it is difficult to see why voluntary
contributions to a religious or charitable institution (whether applicable
solely to religious or charitable purposes or not) should be specially
excepted by the Act. The conclusion, therefore, I have reached is that,
in construing that word “income” in the Indian Income-tax Act, one has
to ask oneself whether, having regard to all the circumstances
surrounding the particular payments and receipts in question, what is
received is of the character of income according to the ordinary
meaning of that word in the English language or whether it is merely a
casual receipt or mere windfall.”
59     In Raghuvanshi Mills Ltd., Bombay Vs. Commissioner of Income-
Tax, Bombay City, (1952) XXII ITR 484 while considering the nature of
receipt of insurance claim for the business loss, the Supreme Court
“It is true the Judicial Committee attempted a narrower definition in
Commissioner of Income-tax v. Shaw Wallace & Co., by limiting income
to “a periodical monetary return 'coming in' with some sort of
regularity, or expected regularity, from definite sources” but, in our
opinion, those remarks must be read with reference to the particular
facts of that case. The non-recurring aspect of this kind of receipt was
considered by the Privy Council in The King v. B.C. Fir and Cedar
Lumber Co. and we do not think their Lordships had in mind a case of
this nature when they decided Shaw Wallace & Company's case.”
60     In Raja Bahadur Kamakshya Narain Singh of Ramgarh Vs.
Commissioner of Income-Tax, Bihar and Orissa, AIR 1943 Privy Council
153, it was observed:-
“Income is not necessarily the recurrent return from a definite source,
though it is generally of that character. Income again may consist of a
series of separate receipts, as it generally does in the case of
professional earnings. The multiplicity of forms which “income” may
assume is beyond enumeration. Generally, however, the mere fact that
the income flows from some capital assets, of which the simplest
illustration is the purchase of an annuity for a lump sum, does not
prevent it from being income, though in some analogous cases the true
view may be that the payments, though spread over a period, are not
income, but instalments payable at specified future dates of a purchase
price. Such a case is illustrated by (1903) A.C.299. But, in their
Lordships' judgment, the royalties here are clearly income and not
capital. They are periodical payments for the continuous enjoyment of
the various benefits under the leases. The actual acquisition of the
property in a particular ton of coal at the moment when the lessees
have cut and taken away the coal is only the final stage.”
61     In Navinchandra Mafatlal, Bombay Vs. Commissioner of Income
Tax, Bombay City, AIR 1955 S.C. 58, while considering the question
whether capital gain could be treated as income if so provided for under
statutory provisions, it was observed:-
“7. What, then, is the ordinary, natural and grammatical meaning of the
word "income"? According to the dictionary it means "a thing that
comes in." (See Oxford Dictionary, Vol. V. p. 162; Stroud, Vol. II, pp.
14-16). In the United States of America and in Australia both of which
also are English speaking countries the word "income" is understood in
a wide sense so as to include a capital gain. Reference may be made to -
'Eisner v. Macomber', (1919) 252 US 189 (K); -'Merchants' Loan and
Trust Co. v. Smietanka', (1920) 255 US 509 (L) and - 'United States of
America v. stewat', (1940) 311 US 60 (M) and - 'Resch v. Federal
Commissioner of Taxation', (1943) 66 CLR 198 (N). In each of these
cases very wide meaning was ascribed to the word "income" as its
natural meaning.”
62     In The Commissioner of Income-Tax, Hyderabad, Deccan Vs. M/s
Vazir Sultan and sons, AIR 1959 SC 814 the issue was whether
compensation for loss of agency was a capital receipt. The compensation
for loss of agency was held to be a capital receipt on the ground that the
agency was a capital asset in that case. It was observed:-
“35. .....The agency agreements in fact formed a capital asset of the
assessee's business worked or exploited by the assessee by entering into
contracts for the sale of the "charminar" cigarettes manufactured by the
Company to the various customer and dealers in the respective
territories. This asset really formed part of the fixed capital of the
assessee's business. It did not constitute the business of the assessee but
was the means by which the assessee entered into the business
transactions by way of distributing those cigarettes within the
respective territories. It really formed the profit-making apparatus of
the assessee's business of distribution of the cigarettes manufactured by
the Company. If it was thus neither circulating capital nor stock-in-trade
of the business carried on by the assessee it could certainly not be
anything but a capital asset of its business and any payment made by
the Company as and by way of compensation for terminating or
cancelling the same would only be a capital receipt in the hands of the
assessee.”
63     In Navnit Lal C. Javeri Vs. K. K.Sen AIR 1965 SC 1375, it was
“16. The question which now arises is, if the impugned section treats
the loan received by a shareholder as a dividend paid to him by the
company, has the legislature in enacting the section exceeded the limits
of the legislative field prescribed by the present Entry 82 in List I? As
we have already noticed, the word "income" in the context must receive
a wide interpretation; how wide it should be it is unnecessary to
consider, because such an enquiry would be hypothetical. The question
must be decided on the facts of each case. There must no doubt be
some rational connection between the item taxed and the concept of
income liberally construed. If the legislature realises that the private
controlled companies generally adopt the device of making advances or
giving loans to their shareholders with the object of evading the
payment of tax, it can step in to meet this mischief, and in that
connection, it has created a fiction by which the amount ostensibly and
nominally advanced to a shareholder, as a loan is treated in reality for
tax purposes as the payment of dividend to him. We have already
explainer how a small number of shareholders controlling a private
company adopt this device. Having regard to the fact that the
legislature was aware of such devices, would it not be competent to the
legislature to device a fiction for treating the ostensible loan as the
receipt of dividend? In our opinion, it would be difficult to hold that in
making the fiction, the legislature has travelled beyond the legislative
field assigned to it by entry 82 in List 1.”
64     In Senairam Doongarmall Vs. Commissioner of Income-Tax,
Assam, AIR 1961 SC 1579, the question was whether compensation
received from military authority on account of loss of earning of tea
estate was income or capital receipt. It was observed that quality of
payment was decisive of the character of income and compensation
received was not income. During the discussion following passage from
English judgment in Sutherland Vs. Commissioners of Inland Revenue
(1918) 12 Tax Case 63 was referred:-
“Now it is quite clear that if a source of income is destroyed by the
exercise of the paramount right... and compensation is paid for it, that
that is not income, although the amount of compensation is the same
sum as the total of the income that has been lost.”
65     In CIT v. G.R. Karthikeyan, 1993 Supp 3 SCC 222, it was
“7. It is not easy to define income. The definition in the Act is an
inclusive one. As said by Lord Wright in Kamakshya Narayan Singh v.
CIT, (1943) 11 ITR 513 (PC) “income ... is a word difficult and perhaps
impossible to define in any precise general formula. It is a word of the
broadest connotation”. In Gopal Saran Narain Singh v. CIT (1935) 3
ITR 237 (PC) the Privy Council pointed out that “anything that can
properly be described as income is taxable under the Act unless
expressly exempted”. This Court had to deal with the ambit of the
expression ‘income’ in Navinchandra Mafatlal v. CIT, (1954) 26 ITR
758. The Indian Income Tax and Excess Profits Tax (Amendment) Act,
1947 had inserted Section 12(B) in the Indian Income Tax Act, 1922.
Section 12(B) imposed a tax on capital gains. The validity of the said
amendment was questioned on the ground that tax on capital gains is
not a tax on ‘income’ within the meaning of Entry 54 of List 1, nor is it a
tax on the capital value of the assets of individuals and companies
within the meaning of Entry 55 of List 1 of the Seventh Schedule to the
Government of India Act, 1935. The Bombay High Court repelled the
attack. The matter was brought to this Court. After rejecting the
argument on behalf of the assessee that the word ‘income’ has acquired,
by legislative practice, a restricted meaning — and after affirming that
the entries in the Seventh Schedule should receive the most liberal
construction — the Court observed thus:
“What, then, is the ordinary, natural and grammatical meaning of the
word ‘income’? According to the dictionary it means ‘a thing that comes
in’. (See Oxford Dictionary, Vol. V, p. 162; Stroud, Vol. II, pp. 14-16).
In the United States of America and in Australia both of which also are
English speaking countries the word ‘income’ is understood in a wide
sense so as to include a capital gain. Reference may be made to Eisner
v. Macomber, 252 US 189; Merchants’ Loan and Trust Co. v.
Smietunka, 255 US 209 and United States v. Stewart, 311 US 60 and
Resch v. Federal Commissioner of Taxation, 66 CLR 198 (1943). In
each of these cases very wide meaning was ascribed to the word
‘income’ as its natural meaning. The relevant observations of learned
Judges deciding those cases which have been quoted in the judgment of
Tendolkar, J. quite clearly indicate that such wide meaning was put
upon the word ‘income’ not because of any particular legislative
practice either in the United States or in the Commonwealth of
Australia but because such was the normal concept and connotation of
the ordinary English word ‘income’. Its natural meaning embraces any
profit or gain which is actually received. This is in consonance with the
observations of Lord Wright to which reference has already been made.
The argument founded on an assumed legislative practice being thus
out of the way, there can be no difficulty in applying its natural and
grammatical meaning to the ordinary English word ‘income’. As already
observed, the word should be given its widest connotation in view of
the fact that it occurs in a legislative head conferring legislative power.”
8. Since the definition of income in Section 2(24) is an inclusive one, its
ambit, in our opinion, should be the same as that of the word income
occurring in Entry 82 of List I of the Seventh Schedule to the
Constitution (corresponding to Entry 54 of List I of the Seventh
Schedule to the Government of India Act).”
66     In the context of compensation received under the Motor Vehicles
Act, the compensation is either on account of loss of earning capacity on
account of death or injury or on account of pain and suffering. Such
receipt is not by way of earning or profit. Award of compensation is on
the principle of restitution to place the claimant in the same position in
which he would have been had the loss of life or injury not been
suffered. In Gobald Motor Service Ltd. and another Vs. R. M. K.
Veluswami and others [AIR 1962 SC 1], it was observed:-
“The same principle was restated with force and clarity by Viscount
Simon in Nance v. British Columbia Electric Railway Co. Ltd., 195l AC
601. There, the learned Lord was considering the analogous provisions
of the British Columbia legislation, and he put the principle thus at p.
"The claim for damages in the present case falls under two
separate heads. First, if the deceased had not been killed, but
had eked out the full span of life to which in the absence of the
accident he could reasonably have looked forward, what sums
during that period would he probably have applied out of his
income to the maintenance of his wife and family?".”
67     In Central Bank of India Vs. Ravindra and others [AIR 2001 SC
3095], the question was whether the interest component of the principal
sum could carry further interest. It was observed:-
“44. We are of the opinion that the meaning assigned to the expression
'the principal sum adjudged' should continue to be assigned to
"principal sum" at such other places in Section 34(1) where the
expression has been used qualified by the adjective "such", that is to
say, as "such principal sum". Recognition of the method of capitalisation
of interest so as to make it a part of the principal consistently with the
contract between the parties or established banking practice does not
offend the sense of reason, justice and equity. As we have noticed such
a system has a long established practice and a series of judicial
precedents upholding the same. Secondly, the underlying principle as
noticed in several decided cases is that when interest is debited to the
account of the borrower on periodical rests, it is debited because of its
having fallen due on that day. Nothing prevents the borrower from
paying the amount of interest on the date it falls due. If the amount of
interest is paid there will be no occasion for capitalising the amount of
interest and converting it into principal. If the interest is not paid on the
date due, from that date the creditor is deprived of such use of the
money which it would have made if the debtor had paid the amount of
interest on the date due. The creditor needs to be compensated for
deprivation. As held in Pazhaniappa Mudaliar v. Narayana Ayyar
(supra), the fact situation is analogous to one as if the creditor has
advanced money to the borrower equivalent to the amount of interest
debited. We are, therefore, of the opinion that the expression "the
principal sum adjudged" may include the amount of interest, charged
on periodical rests, and capitalised with the principal sum actually
advanced, so as to become an amalgam of principal in such cases where
it is permissible or obligatory for the Court to hold so. Where the
principal sum (on the date of suit) has been so adjudged, the same shall
be treated as "principal sum" for the purpose of "such principal sum" -
the expression employed later in Section 34 of C.P.C. The expression
"principal sum" cannot be given different meanings at different places in
the language of same section, i.e. Section 34 of C.P.C.”
68    In Drawing and Disbursing Officer vs. Income Tax Officer [Income
Tax Appeal No.495 of 2009 decided on 30 th March 2011], the Punjab
and Haryana High Court held as under:
“21. Having regard to nature of receipt of compensation as per award
under the M.V.Act, compensation is in the nature of capital receipt for
death or injury and cannot be held to be in the nature of income.
Learned counsel for the revenue also fairly accepts this legal position. It
appears to be for this reason that the said receipt is not sought to be
treated as income.
22. We may now consider the question whether interest on account of
delay in adjudication becomes part of compensation or can be treated
as a separate component of income.
23. Section 171 of the M.V.Act authorizes the Tribunal to award
interest on the claim made under the Act from the date of making the
“171.Award of interest where any claim is allowed:
Where any Claims Tribunal allows a claim for compensation
made under this Act, such Tribunal may direct that in addition to
the amount of compensation simple interest shall also be paid at
such date not earlier than the date of making the claim as it may
specify in this behalf.”
24. In the context of compensation under the provisions of Land
Acquisition Act, 1894, the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Commissioner of
Income-Tax Vs. Ghanshyam (HUF), (2009) 315 ITR 1 SC held that
interest paid by the Collector under Section 34 of the said Act was part
of compensation and was treated to be at par with the compensation for
purposes of taxability. The relevant observations therein are:-
“…Section 28 of the 1894 Act applies only in respect of the
excess amount determined by the Court after reference under
Section 18 of the 1894 Act. It depends upon the claim, unlike
interest under Section 34 which depends on undue delay in
making the award. It is true that “interest” is not compensation.
It is equally true that Section 45(5) of the 1961 Act refers to
compensation. But as discussed hereinabove, we have to go by
the provisions of the 1894 Act which awards “interest” both as
an accretion in the value of the lands acquired and interest for
undue delay. Interest under Section 28 unlike interest under
Section 34 is an accretion to the value, hence it is a part of
enhanced compensation or consideration which is not the case
with interest under Section 34 of the 1894 Act…”
69     We have a very erudite and lucid order passed by the Income Tax
Appellate Tribunal, Ahmedabad Bench in the case of Urvi Chirag Sheth
vs. Income-tax Officer, Ward 5(2)(3), Ahmedabad reported in [2016] 70
taxmann.com 33(Ahmedabad-Trib.), wherein the following has been
“5. As we have noted earlier in this order, the assessee had to go right
upto Hon’ble Supreme Court to have her compensation claim accepted.
What ought to have been paid to her soon after the accident, was
eventually paid in full after twenty one years of the tragic incident.
Hon’ble Supreme Court, vide judgment dated 26th April 2011,
concluded that “Considering all this, we grant compensation of Rs 15
lacs (Rupees fifteen lacs) with interest at the rate of 8% on the
enhanced compensation from the date of filing the claim petition before
MACT (Motor Accidents Claims Tribunal) till the date of realization”.
The payment made to the assessee, therefore, is in the nature of
compensation for the loss of her mobility and physical damages.
Clearly, such a receipt, in principle, is a capital receipt and beyond the
ambit of taxability of income since only such capital receipts can be
brought to tax as are specifically taxable under section 45. Hon'ble
Supreme Court has, in the case of Padmaraje R. Kadambande vs. CIT
[(1992) 195 ITR 877 (SC)], observed that, ". . . . we hold that the
amounts received by the assessee during the financial years in question
have to be regarded as capital receipts and, therefore, are not income
within meaning of s. 2(24) of the Income Tax Act." [Emphasis
supplied]. This clearly implies, as is the settled law, that a capital
receipt, in principle, is outside the scope of 'income' chargeable to tax
and a receipt cannot be taxed as income unless it is in the nature of a
revenue receipt or is specifically brought within ambit of 'income' by
way of specific provisions of the Income Tax Act. The accident
compensation is thus not taxable as income of the assessee. What is
termed as interest also is of the same character and it seeks to
compensate the time value of money on account of delay in payment.
On the first principles, such an interest cannot have a standalone
character of income, unless the interest itself is a kind of statutory
interest at the prescribed rate of interest. Right now, however, we are
dealing with a situation in which the interest is awarded by Hon’ble
Supreme Court in its complete and somewhat unfettered discretion. An
interest of this nature is essentially a compensation in the sense it
accounts for a fall in value of money itself at the point of time when
compensation became payable vis-a-vis the point of time when it was
actually paid, or, for the shrinkage of, what can be termed as, a
measuring rod of value of compensation. If the money was given on the
date of presenting the claim before the MACT, it would have been Rs 15
lacs but since there is an inordinate, though partial, delay in payment of
this amount, interest payment is to factor for fall in value of money in
the meantime. The transaction thus remains the same, i.e.
compensation for disability, and the interest rate, on a rather notional
basis, is taken into account to compute the present value of the
compensation which was lawfully due to the assessee in a somewhat
distant past. Viewed thus, the amount of compensation received at this
point of time, whichever way is it computed, has the same character. If
compensation itself is not taxable, the interest on account of delay in
payment of compensation cannot be taxable either. In the case of CIT
Allahabad High Court has, inter alia, held that “To our opinion, the
award of compensation under motor accidents claims cannot be
regarded as income. The award is in the form of compensation to the
legal heirs for the loss of life of their bread earner. Hence the interest
on such an award cannot be termed as income to the legal heirs or to
the victim himself”. Their Lordships have also observed, referring to a
series of judicial precedents on the issue, that “if interest awarded by
the court for loss suffered on account of deprivation of property or paid
for breach of contract by means of damages, or were not paid in respect
of any debt incurred or money borrowed, shall not attract the
provisions of Section 2(28A) read with Section 194A(1) of the Income
Tax Act”. Essentially, this conclusion supports the school of thought that
when principal transaction, i.e. accident compensation for the delayed
payment of which the interest is awarded, itself is outside the ambit of
taxation, similar fate must follow for the subsidiary transaction, i.e.
interest for delay in payment of compensation, as well. Touching a
different chord but coming to the rescue of the assessee, Hon’ble Punjab
& Haryana High Court, in the case of CIT Vs B Rai [(2004) 264 ITR 617
(P&H)], draws a line of demarcation between the interest granted
under the statutory provisions and interest granted under discretion of
the court, and holds that the latter is outside the scope of ‘income’
which can be brought to tax under the Income Tax Act, 1961. As Their
Lordships stated, in so many words, “where interest………is to be paid
is in the discretion of the court, as in the present case, the said interest
would not amount to ‘income’ for the purposes of income tax”. That
precisely is the situation before us as well.
6. Revenue, however, does not even challenge these propositions, and,
in our considered view, rightly so; it is only on the scope of provisions
of Section 145A(b) and section 56(2)(viii) that they rest their case. It is,
therefore, perhaps only appropriate to appreciate the scope of these
provisions and take a look at the facts surrounding introduction of these
provisions vide the Finance Act 2009.
7. Ironically, the statutory provisions being pressed into service to bring
this income to tax, were provisions meant to give relief to the assessee.
When these provisions were introduced, the Memorandum Explaining
the Provisions of the Finance Bill 2009 had this to say:
Rationalization of provisions for taxation of interest received on
delayed compensation or enhanced compensation
The existing provisions of Income-tax Act provide that income
chargeable under the head “Profits and gains of business or profession”
or “Income from other sources”, shall be computed in accordance with
either cash or mercantile system of accounting regularly employed by
the assessee. Further, the Hon’ble Supreme Court, in the case of Rama
Bai Vs. CIT (181 ITR 400) has held that arrears of interest computed on
delayed or enhanced compensation shall be taxable on accrual basis.
This has caused undue hardship to tax payers. With a view to
mitigating the hardship, it is proposed to amend section 145A to
provide that the interest received by an assessee on compensation or
enhanced compensation shall be deemed to be his income for the year
in which it is received, irrespective of the method of accounting
followed by the assessee. Further, it is proposed to insert clause (viii) in
sub-section (2) of section 56 to provide that income by way of interest
received on compensation or on enhanced compensation referred to in
sub-section (2) of section 145A shall be assessed as “income from other
sources” in the year in which it is received. This amendment will take
effect from 1st April, 2010 and shall accordingly apply in relation to
assessment year 1998-99 and subsequent assessment years. [Clauses
8. In the case of Rama Bai (supra), which is raison d'être for this
amendment in law, Hon’ble Supreme Court, speaking through Hon’ble
Justice S Ranganathan- as he then was, one of the most illustrious
former Presidents of this Tribunal, had observed that “the interest
cannot be taken to have accrued on the date of the order of the Court
granting enhanced compensation but has to be taken as having accrued
year after year from the date of delivery of possession of the lands till
the date of such order”. What is significant, however, that taxability of
interest was not in dispute in the said case; the only dispute was the
year in which the income should be taxed. The amendment in law,
therefore, deals with the point of time when an income is it to be
taxable. It does not bring to tax an income which was, until the point of
time when amendment was made, not taxable earlier. Section 145A, it
is important to bear in mind, deals with the method of accounting on
cash or mercantile basis which again has its focus on the point of time
when an income is taxable rather than taxability of income itself. When
an income is not taxable, section 145A has no relevance. It is in this
backdrop that we can take a look at Section 145A which is as follows:
“Section 145A: Method of accounting in certain cases—
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in section
(a)…………………………..(not relevant for our purposes)
(b) interest received by an assessee on compensation or on
enhanced compensation, as the case may be, shall be deemed to
be the income of the year in which it is received.”
9. Section 145A starts with a non obstante clause which restricts the
scope of Section 145 dealing with the method of accounting. It is not a
charging provision. The only impact it has on taxability of an income is
its timing of taxability. What is not taxable is not made taxable under
section 145A(b) but what is taxable under the mercantile method of
accounting, i.e. on accrual basis, is made taxable on cash basis of
accounting, i.e. at the point of time when interest is actually received.
Nothing else needs to read into this provision, and the memorandum
explaining the provision of Finance Bill 2009, as reproduced earlier,
makes that amply clear. As for the provisions of Section 56(2)(viii), it is
only an enabling provision, as unambiguously made clear in the above
memorandum as well, to bring interest income to tax in the year of
receipt rather than in the year of accrual. Section 56(2)(viii) provides
that……”incomes, shall be chargeable to income tax under the head
‘income from other sources’, namely ….(viii) income by way of interest
received on compensation or enhanced compensation referred to in
clause (b) of Section 145A”. The starting point of this exercise is
income, and it is only when the receipt is in the nature of an income,
that the classification of income under a particular category arises. In
other words, when interest received by the assessee is in the nature of
income, such interest can be taxed under section 56 (2)(viii). Section
56(1) makes this aspect even more clear when it states that “Income of
every kind, which is not to be excluded from the total income under
this Act, shall be chargeable to income tax under the head “income
from other sources”, if it is not chargeable to income tax under any of
the heads specified in Section 14, items A to E”, and then, in the
subsequent provision, i.e. Section 56(2), proceeds to set out an
illustrative, rather than exhaustive list of, such “incomes”. Clearly,
unless a receipt is not an income, there is no occasion for the provisions
of Section 56(1) or 56(2) coming into play. Section 56 does not decide
what is an income. What it holds is that if there is an income, which is
not taxable under any of the heads under Section 14, i.e item A to E, it
is taxable under the head ‘income from other sources’. The receipt being
in the nature of income is a condition precedent for Section 56 coming
into play, and not vice versa. To suggest that since an item is listed
under section 56(2), even without there being anything to show that it
is of income nature, it can be brought to tax is like putting the cart
before the horse. The very approach of the authorities below is devoid
of legally sustainable merits. The authorities below were thus
completely in error in bringing the interest awarded by Hon’ble
Supreme Court to tax. The question of deduction under section 57(iii),
given the above conclusion, is wholly irrelevant. We vacate this action
of the Assessing Officer, and disapprove the CIT(A)’s action of
confirming the same. Grievance of the assessee is thus upheld.
10. As we part with the matter, we must say that, as fellow citizens, we
are deeply anguished to take note of the long journey that the assessee
had to undertake to get her dues and then to fight this unjust income
tax demand on her. In order to ensure that others do not have to tread
the same arduous path- at least with respect to the tax demand, and to
bring an element of certainty, we would suggest that the Central Board
of Direct Taxes may as well take a conscious call on issuing appropriate
administrative instructions in this regard and ensuring that what was
brought as a measure of relief to the taxpayers is not used, by the field
officers, as a source of taxation. Such a step certainly cannot mitigate
the pain of an accident victim but it can probably help in ensuring that
hardships of the accident victim are not further compounded, and that’s
the least that a responsive tax administration, like the one we
fortunately have at present, can do. We must also place on record that
fact that despite smallness of amount involved, learned representatives
have rendered valuable assistance in this case, and that we deeply
appreciate their assistance.”
70    In the case of Managing Director, Tamil Nadu State Transport
Corpn. (Salem) Ltd vs. Chinnadurai reported in [2016] 70 taxmann.com
53 (Madras), the Madras High Court held as under:
“13. The question is whether the provisions of the Income Tax Act
1961, and more specifically, whether the compensation awarded by the
Motor Accident Claims Tribunal to the victim can be classified as a
taxable income under the Income Tax law?. The answer to this question
in the opinion of this Court is in the negative. Compensation cannot be
categorized or even described as income as it has already been stated
that the intention of the legislature in awarding compensation to the
victims of Motor Accident cases is to restitute them and rehabilitate
them.
14. The Income Tax Department appears to have issued a circular dated
14.10.2011 whereby deduction of Income Tax has been ordered on the
award amount and the interest accrued on the deposits made under the
order of the Court in Motor Accident Cases. Taking serious view of this
circular, the Division Bench of the Himachal Pradesh High Court took
Suo-Moto cognizance of the matter and considered the same as a Public
Interest Litigation in the judgment reported in Court on its Motion Vs.
H.P.State Co-operative Bank Ltd & Ors 2014 SCC Online HP 4273 and
has quashed the circular and in an elaborate and well considered
judgment, His Lordship the Hon'ble Chief Justice Mansoor Ahmed Mir
“13.While going through the said provisions of law, one comes to
the inescapable conclusion that the mandate of the said
provisions does not apply to the accident claim cases and the
compensation awarded under the Motor Vehicles Act cannot be
said to be taxable income. The compensation is awarded in lieu
of death of a person or bodily injury suffered in a vehicular
accident, which is damage and not income.
14. Chapters X and XI of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 provides
for grant of compensation to the victims of a vehicular accident.
The Motor Vehicles Act has undergone a sea change and the
purpose of granting compensation under the Motor Vehicles Act
is to ameliorate the sufferings of the victims so that they may be
saved from social evils and starvation, and that the victims get
some sort of help as early as possible. It is just to save them from
sufferings, agony and to rehabilitate them. We wonder how and
under what provisions of law the Income Tax Authorities have
treated the amount awarded or interest accrued on term deposits
made in Motor Accident Claims Cases as income. Therefore, the
said Circular is against the concept and provisions referred to
hereinabove and runs contrary to the mandate of granting
compensation.
...23. Having said so, the Circular, dated 14.10.2011, issued by
the Income Tax Authorities, whereby deduction of income Tax
has been ordered on the award amount and interest accrued on
the deposits made under the orders of the Court in Motor
Accident Claims Cases, is quashed and in case any such
deduction has been made by respondents, they are directed to
refund the same, with interest at the rate of 12% from the date
of deduction till payment, within six weeks from today.”
15. Following the Division Bench Judgment, a learned Single Judge of
the Punjab and Haryana High Court, in a recent decision, in New India
Assurance Company Ltd. Vs.Sudesh Chawla and others, CR.No.430 of
2015 (O&M), reiterating the reasoning given by the Division Bench of
Himachal Pradesh High Court, has opined that award of compensation
is on the principle of restitution to place the claimant in the same
position in which he would have been loss of life or injury has not been
suffered and accordingly held that the orders calling upon the
Insurance Company to pay TDS/deduct TDS on the interest part are not
sustainable.
16. If we look at other jurisdictions like Australia, Unites States and
United Kingdom, even there, the matters where a person has suffered
an injury or there has been a loss of life and a compensation has been
paid in lieu of that, then it has been held by the Courts that there
cannot be any Tax deduction on such compensation. The underlying
basis behind this is that a person who suffers a loss cannot be asked to
part with the solatium he receives since it is the only remedy he has
been provided with by the law.
17. If there is a conflict between a social welfare legislation and a
taxation legislation, then, this Court is of the view that a social welfare
legislation should prevail since it subserves larger public interest. The
Motor Vehicle Act is one such legislation which has been passed with a
benevolent intention for compensating the accident victims who have
suffered bodily disablement or loss of life and the Income Tax Act
which is primarily intended for Tax collection by the State cannot put
spokes in the effective and efficacious enforcement of the Motor
Vehicles Act. In fact, if one might deeply analyse, it could be seen that
there is no direct conflict between any provisions of the Income Tax Act
and the Motor Vehicles Act and it is only by the interpretation of the
provisions the concept of compulsory payment of TDS has crept into the
realm of compensation payment in Motor Vehicle Accident cases.
18. Hence, with due respect I am unable to concur with the findings of
the Karnataka High Court, the Chattisgarh High Court and this Court
cited by the Revision Petitioner. This Court is of the view that the
Division Bench judgment of the Himachal Pradesh high Court and the
judgment of the Single Judge of the Punjab and Haryana High Court lay
down the right law and hence, this Court arrives at the conclusion that
the compensation awarded or the interest accruing therein from the
compensation that has been awarded by the Motor Accident Claims
Tribunal cannot be subjected to TDS and the same cannot be insisted to
be paid to the Tax Authorities since the compensation and the interest
awarded therein does not fall under the term 'income' as defined under
the Income Tax Act, 1961.
19. Therefore, this Court directs that the Petitioner Corporation cannot
deduct any amount towards TDS and the same shall also be deposited
in addition to the amount that has already been deposited to the credit
of M.C.O.P.No.879 of 2006, on the file of the Motor Accident Claims
within a period of four weeks from the date of receipt of a copy of this
order and the Respondent is entitled to take appropriate steps in a
manner known to law to withdraw the amount.”
71    A Division Bench of the Allahabad High Court in the case of
Commissioner of Income-tax vs. Oriental Insurance Co. Ltd. reported in
[2012] 27 taxmann.com 28 (All.) held as under:
“35. Most of the rulings cited by learned counsel for the revenue relates
to interest paid on the delayed payment of compensation awarded
under Land Acquisition Act. The award under Land Acquisition Act and
the award under Motor Vehicle Act cannot be equated for the simple
reason that in land acquisition cases, the payment is made regarding
the price of the land and on such price, the provisions of Capital Gain
Tax are attracted, while in the motor accidents claims, the payment is
made to the legal representatives of the deceased for loss of life of their
bread earner. In most of the cases under motor vehicle accidents claims,
the recipients of awards are poor and illiterate persons who even do not
come within the ambit of Income Tax Act. The amount of compensation
under Motor Vehicle Act, also do not come within the definition of
"income". Therefore, the analogy of compensation under land
acquisition cannot be applied to the motor vehicle accidents claims.
36. The word "interest" as defined under Section 2(28A) has to be
construed strictly. We may refer to Polestar Electronic (Pvt.) Ltd. Vs.
Addl. CST (1978) 41 STC 409, in which hon'ble the Apex Court has
"if there is one principle of interpretation more well settled than
any other, it is that statutory enactment must ordinarily be
construed according to the plain natural meaning of its language
and that no words should be added, altered or modified unless it
is plainly necessary to do so in order to prevent a provision from
being unintelligible, absurd, unreasonable, unworkable or totally
irreconcilable with the rest of the statute."
37. The necessary ingredients of such interest are that it should be in
respect of any money borrowed or debt incurred. The award under the
Motor Vehicle Act is neither the money borrowed by the insurance
company nor the debt incurred upon the insurance company. As far as
the word "claim" is concerned, it should also be regarding a deposit or
other similar right or obligation. The definition of Section 2(28A) of the
Income Tax Act again repeats the words "monies borrowed or debt
incurred" which clearly shows the intention of the legislature is that if
the assessee has received any interest in respect of monies borrowed or
debt incurred including a deposit, claim or other similar right or
obligation, or any service fee or other charge in respect of monies
borrowed or debt incurred has been received then certainly it shall
come within the definition of interest.
38. The word "claim" used in the definition may relates to claims under
contractual liability but certainly do not cover the claims under the
statutory liability. The claim under the Motor Vehicle Act regarding
compensation for death or injury is a statutory liability.
39. Insertion of clause (ix) to Section 194A(3) by the Finance Act 2003
with effect from 1.6.2003 also goes to show that prior to 1.6.2003, the
legislature had no intention to charge any tax on the interest received
as compensation under the Motor Vehicle Act. Even under the amended
Act, interest received in excess of Rs.50,000/- has been subjected to tax
liability. Certainly such interest exceeding Rs.50,000/- has further to be
split amongst all the claimants and has to be spread over for each of the
assessment years. Accordingly there appears to be no justification to
cast liability to deduct the tax at source on the amount of interest paid
on compensation under Motor Vehicle Act prior to 1.6.2003.
40. Further more the definition as provided under Section 194A(1) is
also relevant which provides that if any person is responsible for paying
to a resident any income by way of interest on securities, shall at the
time of credit of such income to the account of the payee deduct
income tax thereon at the rates in force.
41. To our opinion, the award of compensation under motor accidents
claims cannot be regarded as income. The award is in the form of
compensation to the legal heirs for the loss of life of their bread earner.
Hence the interest on such award also cannot be termed as income to
the legal heirs of the deceased or the victim himself.
42. Learned Commissioner of Income Tax (Appeals)-I, Agra in his order
dated 28.3.2003 has discussed most of the cases relating to interest on
land acquisition cases which have also been cited by learned counsel for
the revenue before us. But as mentioned above, the award under land
acquisition can not be equated in any way with the award under motor
accidents claims.
43. The award under the Motor Vehicle Act is like a decree of the court.
It do not come within the definition of income as mentioned in Section
194A(1) read with Section 2(28A) of the Income Tax Act. Proceedings
regarding claim under Motor Vehicle Act are in the nature of a
garnishee proceedings under which the MACT has a right to attach the
judgment debt payable by the insurance company. Even in the MAC
award, there is no direction of any court that before paying the award,
the insurance company is required to deduct the tax at source. In view
of All India Reporter Ltd. Vs. Ramchandra D. Datar (supra), if no
provision has been made in the decree for deduction of tax, before
paying that debt, the insurance company cannot deduct the tax at
source from the amount payable to the legal heirs of the deceased.
44. In Commissioner of Income Tax Vs. Chiranji Lal Multani Mal Rai
N.K. Gupta (supra), Commissioner of Income-tax Vs. H.P. Housing
Board (supra), Commissioner of Income-tax Vs. Sahib Chits (Delhi)
(Pvt.) Ltd. (supra), it has been clearly held that if interest is awarded by
the court for loss suffered on account of deprivation of property or paid
for breach of contract by means of damages or were not paid in respect
of any debt incurred or money borrowed, shall not attract the
provisions of Section 2(28A) read with Section 194A(1) of the Income
72    In the last, we take notice of a very recent pronouncement of the
Bombay High Court in the case of Shri Rupesh Rashmikant Shah vs.
Union of India and others [Writ Petition No.2902 of 2016 decided on 8 th
August 2019], wherein the following has been held:
“57. We, therefore, hold that the interest awarded in the motor accident
claim cases from the date of the Claim Petition till the passing of the
award or in case of Appeal, till the judgment of the High Court in such
Appeal, would not be exigible to tax, not being an income. This position
would not change on account of clause (b) of section 145A of the Act as
it stood at the relevant time amended by Finance Act, 2009 which
provision now finds place in sub-section (1) of section 145B of the Act.
Neither clause (b) of section 145A, as it stood at the relevant time, nor
clause (viii) of sub-section (2) of section 56 of the Act make the interest
chargeable to tax whether such interest is income of the recipient or
not. Section 194A of the Act is only a provision for deduction of tax at
source. Any provision for deduction of tax at source in the said section
would not govern the taxability of the receipt. The question of
deduction of tax at source would arise only if the payment is in the
nature of income of the payee.
58. We are not oblivion to erstwhile clause (ix) of sub-section (3) of
section 194A or the newly amended clauses (ix) and (ixa) thereof
substituting original clause (ix) w.e.f. 1.6.2015 by Finance Act, 2015.
Subsection (1) of section 194A provides for deduction of tax at source
upon payment of any income by way of interest. Sub-section (3) of
section 194A contains exclusion clauses from the purview of sub-section
(1). Clause (ix) contained in sub- section (3) prior to amendment
pertained to income credited or paid by way of interest on the
compensation amount awarded by the Motor Accident Claims Tribunal
where such amount did not exceed Rs.50,000/-. In substitution of this
provision, clause (ix) now provides that the provision of sub-section (1)
will not apply to such income credited by way of interest on the
compensation awarded by the Motor Accident Claims Tribunal. Clause
(ixa) virtually retains the original provision of unamended clause (ix).
The learned ASG would, therefore, contend that by virtue of these
provisions, requirement of deducting tax at source on interest income
would not arise only if the same does not exceed Rs.50,000/- in a
financial year or where such income is merely credited. In other words,
at the time of payment of interest, the provision for deduction of tax at
source would kick in.
59. So far as the plain meaning of section 194A(1) read with erstwhile
clause (ix) and substituted clauses (ix) and (ixa) of sub- section (3) is
concerned, there can be no doubt or dispute. However, the
fundamental question is does section 194A make the interest income
chargeable to tax if it otherwise is not. The answer has to be in the
negative. The provision for deduction of tax at source is not a charging
provision. It only makes deduction of tax at source on payment of same,
which, in the hands of payee, is income. If the payee has no liability to
pay such income, the liability to deduct tax at source in the hands of
payer cannot be fastened. In other words, the provision of deducting
tax at source cannot govern the taxability of the amount which is being
paid.
60. In the decision of the Gujarat High Court in the case of Hansaguri
Prafulchandra (supra), the Court had no occasion to decide the
taxability of interest on compensation or enhanced compensation of
motor accident cases. This was also the position in the case of decision
of this Court in the Gauri Deepak Patel & ors. (supra).
61. We may clarify that these observations and conclusions would apply
to interest on compensation or enhanced compensation awarded by the
Motor Accident Claims Tribunal or High Court from the date of the
Claim Petition till passing of the award or the judgment. Further
interest which may be paid for delay in depositing the awarded
amount, would not form part of the compensation and, therefore,
would fall in the bracket of interest income and would be exigible to tax
under the normal provisions.”
73     The upshot of the aforesaid discussion is that the compensation
received under the Motor Vehicles Act is either on account of loss of
earning capacity on account of death or injury or on account of pain and
suffering and such receipt is not by way of earning or profit. The award
of compensation is on the principle of restitution to place the claimant in
the same position in which he would have been as the loss of life or
injury would not have been suffered.
74     Our final conclusion may be summarized as under:
[a]      The interest awarded by the Motor Accident Claim Tribunal
u/s 171 of the Motor Vehicles Act 1988 is not taxable under the
[b]      The interest awarded in the motor accident claim cases
from the date of the Claim Petition till the passing of the award, or
in the case of Appeal, till the judgment of the High Court in such
appeal, would not be exigible to tax, not being an income. This
position would not change on account of clause (b) of Section
145A of the Act as it stood at the relevant time amended by
Finance Act, 2009, which provision now finds place in sub-section
(1) of Section 145B of the Act. Neither clause (b) of Section 145A,
as it stood at the relevant time, nor clause (viii) of sub-section (2)
of Section 56 of the Act make the interest chargeable to tax,
whether such interest is income of the recipient or not. Section
194A of the Act is only a provision for deduction of tax at source.
Any provision for deduction of tax at source in the said section
would not govern the taxability of the receipt. The question of
deduction of tax at source would arise only if the payment is in
the nature of income of the payee.
[c] The Insurance Companies or the owners of the motor vehicles
depositing the requisite amount in due compliance with the
awards of the Motor Accident Claims Tribunals shall deposit the
full amount with the Tribunal and shall not deduct tax u/s 194A
of the Income Tax Act on the interest awarded by the Motor
75     We may clarify that the aforesaid observations and conclusions
would apply to interest granted on compensation or enhanced
compensation awarded by the Motor Accident Claims Tribunal or the
High Court from the date of the Claim Petition till the passing of the
award or the judgment.
76     Further, the interest that may be paid for the delay in depositing
the awarded amount, would not form part of the compensation and,
therefore, would fall in the bracket of interest income and would be
exigible to tax under the normal provisions.
77     The matter shall now be notified along with the other allied
matters for further hearing on other factual issues arising in the present
