1.     In the above Interim Application, an order was passed on 20 th
October, 2022, wherein this Court opined that at the ad-interim stage,
no relief could be granted in relation to the film “Thank God” and the
Defendants were given time to file their affidavit in reply. The matter
was thereafter placed on board on 22nd November, 2022 for other ad-
interim reliefs.
2.           When the above matter came up on 22 nd November, 2022,
Dr. Saraf, the learned Senior Counsel fairly stated that in light of the
order dated 20th October, 2022 and the subsequent events, the Plaintiff
was not pressing for ad-interim reliefs in terms of prayer clauses (i) to
(iv) of the Interim Application. He submitted that the Interim
Application would only survive for ad-interim reliefs in terms of prayer
clause (v). This is how the matter was placed before me today.
3.           After the matter was argued for some time, both parties
agreed that the above Suit itself can be disposed of in the following
