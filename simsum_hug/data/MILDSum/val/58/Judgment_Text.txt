The Criminal Revision Petition and Criminal Petitions are

The respondent No.1- complainant-Police has charge
sheeted respondent No.2 i.e., accused No.3 - Smt.Mamatha
R., who is respondent No.2 in Criminal Revision Petition
No.206/2018 and Criminal Petition No.711/2018. She is also
the petitioner in Criminal Petition No.7026/2019.             A charge
sheet    was    filed  by    respondent      No.1-Police     in  Crime
No.400/2015, for the offences punishable under Sections
302, 493, 494, 496, 120-B, 201 read with Section 34 of
Indian Penal Code, 1860, (hereinafter for brevity referred to
as `IPC').     An application under Section 227 of Code of
Criminal Procedure, 1973 (hereinafter for brevity referred to
as `Cr.P.C.'), filed by said Smt.Mamatha R., (accused No.3)
in S.C.No.20/2017, pending in the Court of learned V
Addl.District & Sessions Judge, Mandya (hereinafter for
brevity referred to as `Sessions Judge's Court'), came to be
allowed by the order of the Sessions Judge's Court dated
04.08.2017 and accused No.3 came to be discharged for the
offences above mentioned.
2. Challenging the said order, CW-2 K.C.Ramu @
Ramanna, the father of the deceased K.R.Manjunatha and
father-in-law of accused No.3-Smt.Mamatha R., has filed
Criminal Revision Petition No.206/2018, under Section 397(1)
read with Section 401 of Cr.P.C.
Very same CW-2 K.C.Ramu @ Ramanna has filed
Criminal Petition No.711/2018, under Section 482 of Cr.P.C.
seeking a direction to any other investigating authority to
investigate  the    case  in  Crime No.400/2015,      which   is
later numbered as S.C.No.20/2017 pending in the Sessions
After the discharge of accused No.3 by the Sessions
Judge's   Court  vide   its order  dated    04.08.2017,      the
complainant-State has filed an application under Section 319
of Cr.P.C. on 22.08.2019. The Sessions Judge's Court issued
summons to the said Smt.Mamatha R., on the application.
Aggrieved by the said order of the Sessions Judge's Court,
said   Smt.Mamatha      R.,  has   filed   Criminal     Petition
No.7026/2019 under Section 482 of Cr.P.C.
3. The respondent No.1-State is being represented by
learned High Court Government Pleader.       The respondent-
Smt.Mamatha R., is being represented by her counsel.
4. The records in S.C.No.20/2017 were called for and
the same are placed before this Court.
5. Since all these matters have arisen out of the very
same Sessions Case No.20/2017, all these matters are
connected with each other and taken up to hear the common
arguments and to pass a common order.
6. Heard the arguments from both side.             Perused the
materials placed before this Court.
For the sake of convenience, the parties would be henceforth
referred to as per their rankings before the trial Court.
7. After hearing both side, the points that arise for my
consideration are,-
(1) Whether the order dated 04.08.2017, passed
in S.C.No.20/2017 by the Sessions Judge's Court is
perverse warranting interference at the hands of this
deserves    to be    allowed   with a   direction    for an
investigating agency other than the Karnataka State
Police to investigate in Crime No.400/2015 in the 1st
respondent-Police Station?
(3) Whether the order dated 22.08.2019, passed
in S.C.No.20/2017 by the Sessions Judge's Court
ordering issuance of summons to the proposed accused
No.3 therein deserves to be set aside?
8. The case of prosecution is that, on 25.08.2015, in the
afternoon, the respondent-Police received an information
about the presence of a dead body near V.C. canal, which
was closed to Kalenahalli. The police after visiting the spot,
taken out the dead body and noticed that it had piercing
injuries on the back of the head and stomach and also the
legs, hands and neck of the dead body were tied with a rope.
Thereafter, on the same day, at about 5.30 p.m., upon an
information of one Sri H.Anand Kumar, the Police Officer,
Crime No.400/2015 came to be registered in the respondent-
Police Station against unknown persons for the offences
punishable    under   Sections     302,   201    of   IPC.      After
investigation,   the   respondent-Police     filed   charge    sheet
against the three accused, including Smt.Mamatha R., the
petitioner in Criminal Petition No.7026/2019, for the above
said offences.
9. The summary of the charge sheet is that the
deceased     was  one   Sri K.R.Manjunatha.         He    married
accused No.3 Smt.Mamatha R., on 04.03.2009. Out of their
marriage, they got a girl child by name Bhandavya. On the
date 09.10.2013, deceased K.R.Manjunatha left his house.
Thereafter, his whereabouts were not known till 2015. When
said K.R.Manjunatha returned back to his house in April
2015, he came to know that his wife Mamatha R., (accused
No.3), had married to accused No.1 Manjunath Y.D. @
Sketch Manju @ Manju. The deceased K.R.Manjunatha had
requested said accused No.1 to give the custody of his
daughter Bhandavya back to him.         The accused No.1 and
accused No.3 thinking that so long deceased K.R.Manjunatha
is alive, they wont have peace in life, hatched a conspiracy to
cause his death. Accordingly, accused No.1 engaged accused
No.2 to kill K.R.Manjunatha. Accordingly, accused Nos.1 and
2 took the deceased K.R.Manjunatha with them and made
him to consume liquor and put him in a car and caused his
murder by inflicting multiple pierce injuries upon him with a
knife and in order to destroy the evidence of the incident,
took the dead body in the same car for some more distance
and threw it in V.C. canal near Hulikere.     Thus, they have
committed the alleged offence.
10. Learned counsel for the petitioner in Criminal
Revision   Petition   No.206/2018     and   Criminal     Petition
No.711/2018 in his argument submitted that CW-30 â€“
Smt.Lakshmi, the mother of the deceased, apart from giving
the details of the marital life of the deceased with accused
No.3, has also stated about the second marriage of accused
No.3 with accused No.1 and has specifically expressed her
suspicion that accused No.1 and accused No.3 with the help
of others, have taken her son some where, killed him and
dumped his body in V.C. canal.      He further submitted that
CW-31 Nataraj, the friend of the deceased also spoken about
the marital life of accused No.1 with accused No.3 and the
second marriage of accused No.3 with accused No.1. He too
has expressed his belief that accused No.3 was involved in
the death of the deceased.
Learned counsel further submitted that CW-8 Sukanya
is the neighbour of accused Nos.1 and 3 and she has also
spoken about she seeing accused No.1 and accused No.3
living together as her neighbour as husband and wife.
11. These evidences clearly make out a prima facie case
that accused No.3, apart from marrying with accused No.1,
has also involved in the commission of the murder of her first
husband deceased K.R.Manjunatha. However, the trial Court
opining that the offence punishable under Section 494 of IPC
cannot be investigated by the police and it could not notice
any tangible material to attract Section 120-B of IPC, has
allowed the application filed by accused No.3 filed under
Section 227 of Cr.P.C., which is erroneous, as such, the
Criminal Revision Petition deserves to be allowed.
He   further   submitted    that   during   the    course     of
investigation, the Investigating Officer since has not recorded
the statement of Bhandavya, the daughter of the deceased
and accused No.3, the investigation has not been done
properly,   as   such,  further    investigation   to   record    the
statement of said Bhandavya is required, for which, Criminal
Petition No.711/2018 deserves to be allowed.
12. Learned counsel for respondent No.2 in Criminal
and for the petitioner in Criminal Petition No.7026/2019 i.e.,
for accused No.3, in his argument submitted that none of the
charge sheet witnesses have stated         about the involvement
of accused No.3 in the alleged commission of crime.             There
are no proof for the second marriage between accused Nos.1
and 3. Further stating that if Criminal Revision Petition is allowed,
his Criminal Petition No.7026/2019 becomes infructuous, learned
counsel  prayed    for dismissal    of Criminal   Revision    Petition
No.206/2018 and Criminal Petition No.711/2018.
13. Learned High Court Government Pleader who was
directed to file his written arguments, has filed his written
arguments, wherein he has contended that there are ample
materials to prosecute accused No.3 for the offences. There
are sufficient materials to show that she had undergone
second marriage with accused No.1 and hatched a conspiracy
to eliminate her first husband deceased K.R.Manjunatha. It
is further stated by the     learned High Court Government
Pleader that since the State did not challenge the order of the
trial Court   allowing the IA. filed by   accused No.3 under
Section 227 of Cr.P.C. and after recording of evidence of few
witnesses, it noticed that there are incriminating materials
against accused No.3, as such, the prosecution filed an
application under Section 319 of Cr.P.C. in the trial Court,
upon which, the summons has been ordered against accused
No.3.    He orally submitted that if the Criminal Revision
Petition, which he supports, is allowed, his application under
Section 319 of Cr.P.C. pending in the trial Court become
14. The deceased K.R.Manjunatha married the original
accused No.3 Smt.Mamatha R., on 04.03.2009. The couple
got a small child born to them out of their wedlock by name
Bhandavya and the said child was aged about six years as on
the date of the alleged incident.   Said K.R.Manjunatha was
said to have left his house without intimation to anybody due
to the debt incurred for his vices.    After lodging the police
complaint, said K.R.Manjunatha was said to have traced by
the police.  His father K.C.Ramu (CW-2) was said to have
cleared his debts. CW-2 is also shown to have stated that, at
the instance of his second son,     K.R.Mahesha (CW-3), the
family property was said to be partitioned.        The property
going to the share of deceased K.R.Manjunatha is shown to
have been made in the name of his daughter Bhandavya.
According to CW-2, once again on 09.10.2013, his son
K.R.Manjunatha was found missing, in which connection, a
complaint was lodged with the police on 15.11.2013.         His
wife i.e., Smt.Mamatha R., and their daughter Bhandavya
were started living in the house of CW-2. However, later at
the instance of maternal uncle of said Mamatha R., the said
Mamatha R., (original accused No.3) was shown to have
married to accused No.1 Y.D.Manjunatha.         Later in April
2015, K.R.Manjunatha, the missing person, was said to have
returned to his house and after coming to know that his wife
Mamatha R., had married to accused No.1 and was residing
with him, he started seeking the custody of his daughter
Bhandavya from her. It is in that connection, in order to get
rid of K.R.Manjunatha, who was frequently visiting accused
Nos.1 and 3 and pestering them to give custody of his
daughter   Bhandavya,    all the  three   accused,    including
Mamatha R., hatched a conspiracy and killed K.R.Manjunatha
and threw his dead body into V.C. canal.
The father of the deceased i.e., CW-2 K.C.Ramu,
brother of the deceased i.e., CW-3 K.R.Mahesha, mother of
the deceased CW-30 Smt.Lakshmi, are shown to have given
their statements before the Investigating Officer on the
above lines.
15. Apart from the above witnesses, CW-4 Papanna,
CW-5 Thimmegowda and CW-6 Shivanna, are shown to have
stated before the Investigating Officer about the second
marriage of Mamatha R. (original accused No.3) with accused
No.1. CW-8 Sukanya is shown to have stated before the
Investigating Officer that accused No.1 and accused No.3
Mamatha R., were residing together as her neighbour.
Apart from these witnesses, CW-22 Nandisha, who is
none else than the elder brother of Mamatha R. (accused
No.3) is also shown to have stated about they performing the
second marriage of Mamatha R. with accused No.1.
16. The charge sheet witnesses in the additional charge
sheet CW-42 K.B.Prakash is shown to have given his
statement stating that it was him who as a Purohit,
performed the marriage of accused No.1 and Mamatha R.
CW-43 S. Siddesh and CW-44         K.B. Kumaraswamy in
the additional charge sheet are shown to have given their
statement stating that both of them have attended the
marriage of Mamatha R., (accused No.3) with accused No.1.
Thus, at this stage, there are ample materials to
prosecute original accused No.3 Mamatha R. for the offence
punishable under Section 494 of IPC.
The Sessions Judge's Court observing that an offence
punishable under Section 494 of IPC cannot be investigated
by the police, has proceeded to ignore the ample materials
available before it to prosecute accused No.3 Mamatha R., for
the alleged offence.
17. Learned counsel for the revision petitioner relying
upon     the   judgment      of    Hon'ble   Apex      Court    in
State of Orissa â€“vs- Sharat Chandra Sahu and another,
reported in (1996) 6 SCC 435, submitted that police are not
debarred from investigating non-cognizable cases and include
them in the charge sheet, more particularly, Section 494 of
In Sharat Chandra Sahu's case (supra), the police had
filed a charge sheet for the offence punishable under Section
498-A of IPC as also under Section 494 of IPC.                The
respondent No.1 therein filed a petition under Section 482 of
Cr.P.C. before the Orissa High Court seeking quashing of the
proceedings and charges framed against him.             The High
Court partly allowed the petition with the finding that since
respondent No.2, the wife who had made the complaint in
writing to the Women's Commission about respondent No.1
contracting the second marriage, but, not personally herself
filed  complaint  under    Section  494   of   IPC,    on  which
cognizance could not have been taken by the learned
Magistrate in view of provisions contained in Section 198(1)
of Cr.P.C. Consequently, the charge framed by the learned
Magistrate under Section 494 of Cr.P.C. was quashed, but,
the charge under Section 498-A of IPC was maintained and
the petition under Section 482 of Cr.P.C. to that extent was
dismissed. The same was challenged by the State of Orissa
before the Hon'ble Apex Court.        The Hon'ble Apex Court in
Paragraphs-11 and 12 of its judgment observed as below :
" 11. Sub-section (4) creates a legal fiction and
provides that although a case may comprise of
several offences of which some are cognizable and
others are not, it would not be open to the police to
investigate the cognizable offences only and omit the
non-cognizable offences.      Since the whose case
(comprising     of  cognizable    and   non-cognizable
offences) is to be treated as cognizable, the police
had no option but to investigate the whole of the
case and to submit a charge-sheet in respect of all
the offences, cognizable or non-cognizable both,
provided it is found by the police during investigation
that the offences appear, prima facie, to have been
committed.
12. Sub-section (4) of Section 155 is a new
provision introduced for the first time in the Code in
1973.    This was done to overcome the controversy
about investigation of non-cognizable offences by the
police without the leave of the Magistrate.           The
statutory provision is specific, precise and clear and
there is no ambiguity in the language employed in
sub-section (4).      It is apparent that if the facts
reported to the police disclose both cognizable and
non-cognizable offences, the police would be acting
within the scope of its authority in investigating both
the offences as the legal fiction enacted in sub-
section (4) provides that even a non-cognizable case
shall, in that situation, be treated as cognizable."
With the above observation, the Hon'ble Apex Court
allowed the appeal and the impugned judgment and order
passed by Orissa High Court in so far as it purports to quash
the charge under Section 494 of IPC and the proceedings
relating thereto, was set aside.
18. In Ushaben â€“vs- Kishorbhai Chunilal Talpada and
others,    reported in    (2012) 6 SCC 353,        the Hon'ble Apex
Court was pleased to observe that, where complaint contains
allegations of commission of offences both under Section
498-A of IPC, as well as Section 494 of IPC, the Court can
take cognizance thereof even on the police report. It further
observed that no fetters can be put on powers of police
preventing them from investigating the complaint alleging
offences both under Section 494 and Section 498-A of IPC.
From the above judgment, it is clear that when a
complaint comprises both cognizable and non-cognizable
offences, the investigating agency i.e., the police are required
to treat all the offences cognizable and proceed to investigate
the case and to submit the charge sheet for all the offences,
cognizable or non-cognizable both, provided it is found by the
police during investigation that offences alleged prima facie
have been committed.
19. In the instant case also, after recording statements
of several of the witnesses, including the one mentioned
above, the Investigating Officer has rightly come to a
conclusion that there are ample materials to file charge sheet
against Mamatha R., (original accused No.3) also for the
offence punishable under Section 494 of IPC.        Hence, the
impugned order of the learned Sessions Judge's on the said
point appears to be erroneous.
20. With regard to other offences, including the one
punishable under Section 302 and Section 120-B of IPC are
concerned, no doubt, none of the charge sheet witnesses
appears to have alleged any direct overt act against accused
No.3   -  Mamatha    R.,  however,  the  very    case   of  the
complainant and his family members is that the property that
has come to the share of the deceased K.R.Manjunatha in a
family   partition was   made   in favour   of   his  daughter
Bhandavya      as  a  guardian.    The   conclusion     of  the
Investigating Officer in Column No.17 of the charge sheet is
also that the accused in order to take advantage of the
property made in favour of Bhandavya, the daughter of the
deceased, had not only refused to give custody of said
Bhandavya to the deceased, but, also decided to eliminate
him so as to retain the property with them. It is attributing
with the said mens rea on the part of the accused, the charge
sheet has included Section 120-B of IPC also with other
A perusal of the charge sheet papers go to show that
CW-30 - Smt.Lakshmi, the mother of the deceased, has in
her statement before the Investigating Officer accuses the
involvement    of  her  daughter-in-law   i.e.,  Mamatha     R.,
(accused No.3) in the murder of her son K.R.Manjunatha.
21. CW-31 - Nataraja, who is shown to be a friend of
deceased K.R.Manjunatha, is shown to have stated before the
Investigating Officer that deceased K.R.Manjunatha was
telling him about his marital life with Mamatha R., and
second marriage of said Mamatha R., with accused No.1 and
also he (deceased) demanding the custody of their child
Bhandavya to him, however, accused No.3 Mamatha R.,
refusing to hand over the custody of the child to the
deceased. He has stated that he believes that accused No.3
Mamatha R., and accused No.1 might have killed the
As observed above, CW-8 Sukanya is shown to have
stated before the Investigating Officer that accused No.1 and
accused No.3 were residing as her neighbour as husband and
wife. Even the elder brother of Mamatha R., (accused No.3)
has also spoken about they performing the second marriage
of Mamatha R., with accused No.1.
22. In the supplementary charge sheet filed by the
police, several of the charge sheet witnesses, including CW-4
Papanna,    CW-5 Thimmegowda and CW-6 Shivanna,              are
shown to have stated about the marital dispute between the
deceased and accused No.3.      Among them, CW-4 Papanna
and CW-5 Thimmegowda are also shown to have conducted a
panchayat and advised the parties.
23. The Investigating Officer is said to have collected
several   of the   incriminating  materials,   including   motor
vehicles used in the commission of the crime, rope of a larger
length, a plastic rope, a knife with iron handle, blood stained
car-mat, cell phones, DVRs etc.,      According to the learned
High Court Government Pleader, several of those articles
have got relationship with accused No.3-Mamatha R., and
it is only during the course of the trial, the conspiracy
between the accused can be established by the prosecution.
I do not find any reason to reject the said argument of
learned High Court Government Pleader, particularly in the
instant case when Mamatha R., (accused No.3) was said to
be the wife of deceased K.R.Manjunatha and subsequently
married to accused No.1 - Y.D.Manjunatha and accused No.1
and accused No.3 are said to have been refusing to give the
custody of daughter of the deceased to him only with an
intention to retain the property said to be standing in favour
of Bhandavya, daughter of deceased and accused No.3.
There are all the reasons to believe that there are materials
to subject Mamatha R., (accused No.3) also for trial for all
the alleged offences in the charge sheet.
24. In Hem Chand â€“vs- State of Jharkhand, reported in
(2008) 5 SCC 113,     the Hon'ble Apex Court at Para-9 of its
judgment was pleased to observe that, it is beyond any
doubt or dispute that at the stage of framing of charge, the
Court will not weigh the evidence. The stage for appreciating
the evidence for the purpose of arriving at a conclusion as to
whether the prosecution was able to bring home the charge
against the accused or not would arise only after all the
evidence is brought on record at the trial.
In the instant case also, since it is observed above that
there are sufficient materials to proceed with the trial against
Mamatha R., (original accused No.3), the Sessions Judge's
Court was at error in allowing her application filed under
Section 227 of Cr.P.C. and discharging her from the alleged
offences.    As such, the said order deserves to be set aside
and her application filed under Section 227 of Cr.P.C.
deserved to be dismissed.
25. CW-2 K.C.Ramu, the father of the deceased has
filed Criminal Petition No.711/2018, seeking a direction for
any other investigating authority to investigate the case in
Crime    No.400/2015,    which    is  the   subject     matter   in
S.C.No.20/2017.     As submitted by learned counsel for the
petitioner, the only reason for seeking a fresh investigation is
for  the   limited  purpose   of   recording   the    evidence   of
Bhandavya, the girl child of the deceased and accused No.3.
Even according to the petitioner, the said daughter is aged
only about six years. When according to the prosecution, the
alleged murder has taken at a place which was away from
the home of accused No.3, where the child was residing, the
said child cannot be expected to speak about the murder of
her father.
Regarding the alleged conspiracy, it is not the case of
the prosecution that in the presence of said girl Bhandavya,
the conspiracy was hatched by the accused.        Further more,
the said child was only of about 6 years in her age. For all
these reasons, the investigation cannot be found fault with
and also for the reason of non-recording the statement of
Bhandavya, the girl child of the deceased. As such, I do not
find any reason for allowing Criminal Petition No.711/2008.
26. The matter was proceeded with in the Sessions
Judgeâ€™s Court in S.C.No.20/2017, where six witnesses from
PW-1 to PW-6 were examined on behalf of the prosecution.
After recording their evidence, the prosecution has filed an
application under Section 319 of Cr.P.C. seeking inclusion of
discharged accused No.3 in the case and to take cognizance
against her. The Sessions Judgeâ€™s Court ordered for issuance
of summons to accused No.3- Mamatha R., on 22.08.2019.
It is challenging the said order, said Mamatha R., has filed
27. Learned counsel for the petitioner for Smt.Mamatha
R., in the said petition in his argument made a submission
that, in case if this Court allows Criminal Revision Petition
No.206/2018,     then,  his  Criminal Petition   No.7026/2019
becomes infructuous.
Learned   High   Court   Government    Pleader    for  the
respondent-State also submitted that if Criminal Revision
Petition No.206/2018 is allowed, his application filed under
Section 319 of Cr.P.C. in the Sessions Judgeâ€™s Court becomes
infructuous. In view of the fact that the impugned order in
Criminal Revision Petition No.206/2018 is now found to be
perverse and deserves to be set aside, the said Criminal
Revision Petition No.206/2018 deserves to be allowed.
Consequently, the Criminal Petition No.7026/2019 proves to
be devoid of merit and deserves to be dismissed.
28. Accordingly, I proceed to pass the following order:
