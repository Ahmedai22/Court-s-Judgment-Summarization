This petition is filed under Section 438 of Cr.P.C. praying
to enlarge the petitioner/accused on bail in the event of his
arrest in FOC No.51/2020-21 (Case No.05/2020-21) registered
Gauribidanur now pending in PCR No.56/2020 on the file of
Principal Civil Judge & JMFC., Gauribidarnur, for the offences
punishable under Sections 2, 9, 50 read with 51 of the Wild Life
2.    Heard    the   learned  counsel   appearing  for  the
petitioners and the learned High Court Government Pleader
appearing for the respondent/State.
3.    This matter was heard and reserved on 10.01.2022.
Having heard the learned counsel appearing for the petitioner
and the learned High Court Government Pleader appearing for
the respondent-State and considering the factual aspects of the
case, it is the case of the prosecution that the respondent –
Deputy Range Forest Officer, Gauribidanur Range, detected the
crime on 08.07.2020 at Hakki-Pikki Colony, Kurudi beat, Hosur
Hobli, Gauribidanur Range. The respondent recovered three
number monitor lizard and three number gray francolin, in the
house of petitioner - Ramesh in the said colony. The respondent
being a public servant under Section 59 of the Wild Life
(Protection) Act, 1972 has filed a complaint under Section 55(b)
read with Section 51 of the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972 and
the said case is numbered as PCR No.56/2020-21. The Trial
Court took the cognizance of the said offence and registered a
case and issued summons to the accused vide order dated
15.07.2020 and fixed the date of appearance on 05.10.2020 of
this petitioner. The accused was served with summons and
appeared through his counsel and also sought for exemption by
filing application under Section 205 of Cr.P.C., instead of Section
317 of Cr.P.C., which was allowed by the Trial Court, yet, the
accused remained absent on 06.10.2021. Hence, NBW had been
issued against the accused from time to time.         Hence, the
petitioner has approached this Court by filing the present
4.    The main contention of the petitioner before this
Court is that no prima facie case is made out against the
petitioner and the very search conducted by the complainant is
not in accordance with Section 50(8) of the Wild Life (Protection)
Act, 1972. As per the complaint without a search warrant the
complainant based on some information allegedly searched the
house of petitioner and conducted seizure under Mahazar and
the very seizure itself is doubtful. The learned Magistrate ought
not to have issued notice to the petitioner and committed an
error in taking cognizance. It is also contended that there is no
any direct evidence and also the alleged lizard had kept in the
vegetable crate outside the house and not inside the house and
the very procedure adopted by the respondent by filing a private
complaint based on the seizure done under a Mahazar and
without any independent witness creates a doubt about the
veracity of the seizure. The Sessions Judge ought to have
admitted the petition filed under Section 438 of Cr.P.C., instead
of rejecting the same. Hence, it requires an interference of this
5.    Per contra, the learned High Court Government
Pleader appearing for the State would submit that the very
petition itself is not maintainable and the private complaint is
filed under Section 200 of Cr.P.C., as envisaged under Section
55(b) of the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972 read with Section
51 of the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972. The respondent being
a public servant under Section 59 of the Wild Life (Protection)
Act, 1972 empowered to file a complaint and the complaint is
also filed in terms of the special enactment. Learned High Court
Government      Pleader  also  would   submit  that the   learned
Magistrate having considered the contents of the complaint and
looking into the material took the cognizance and issued the
summons. The petitioner also appeared through his counsel by
filing a necessary application, which was allowed by the Trial
Court, but he failed to appear before the Trial Court afterwards.
Hence, NBW was issued. Hence, he is not entitled for the relief of
anticipatory bail. Once the accused/petitioner has appeared
before the Trial Court through his Counsel and ought to have
made an application for recalling the order before the Trial Court
instead of invoked Section 438 of Cr.P.C.
6.    Having heard the learned counsel appearing for the
petitioner and the learned High Court Government Pleader
appearing for the State, the points that would arise for the
(i)  Whether Section 438 Cr.P.C., can be invoked once
the petitioner appeared through the Counsel and
sought for exemption and the same was allowed?
7.    Having heard the respective counsel and considering
the material available on record, it is not in dispute that a
private complaint is filed as envisaged under the special
enactment. It is the case of the prosecution that the respondent
has seized three number monitor lizard and three number gray
francolin, in the house of the petitioner - Ramesh in the said
colony. It is also not in dispute that after issuance of summons,
which has been served on the petitioner herein, he had appeared
through Counsel and an exemption was sought under Section
205 of Cr.P.C., instead of Section 317 of Cr.P.C., and the same
was also allowed by the Trial Court, he remained absent
thereafter and NBW was issued against him. It has to be noted
that nowhere in the petition has stated that the counsel was
engaged before the Trial Court and sought for an exemption and
the appearance through counsel has been suppressed by the
8.   The learned counsel appearing for the petitioner in
support of his arguments, he contend that upon even though the
petitioner had appeared through his Counsel, he can maintain
the petition under Section 438 of Cr.P.C., and engaging the
counsel and appearing through the Counsel will not take away
the rights of approaching the Court by invoking Section 438 of
9.   The learned counsel appearing for the petitioner in
support of his arguments, he relied upon the judgment of the
Apex Court in the case of Niranjan Singh and another v.
Prabhakar Rajaram Kharote and others reported in AIR
1980 SC 785, wherein, the Apex Court discussed with regard to
the custody where the accused had appeared and surrendered
before the Sessions Judge, the Judge would have jurisdiction to
consider the bail application as the accused would be considered
to have been in custody within meaning of Section 439 of
Cr.P.C., and no dispute with regard to the fact that once he
appeared and surrendered before the Court, it amounts to a
custody and he maintain a petition under Section 439 of Cr.P.C.,
and in the judgment also Apex Court interpreted the word
10.   The learned counsel also relied upon the judgment of
the Apex Court in the case of Directorate of Enforcement v.
Deepak Mahajan and another reported in AIR 1994 SC
1775, wherein the words ‘arrest’, ‘custody’ and ‘powers’ under
the Act discussed. The Apex Court has also observed that
whether the person is under arrest or not, depends not on the
legality of the arrest, but on whether he has been deprived of his
personal liberty to go wherever he pleases. When used in the
legal sense in connection with criminal offences, an ‘arrest’
consists in the taking into custody of another person under
detaining him to answer a criminal charge or of preventing the
commission of a criminal offence. No doubt, the Apex Court in
both the cases discussed with regard to the meaning of custody
and the word ‘arrest’. But in the case on hand, the Court has to
look into the aspect of whether the petitioner can seek an
anticipatory bail once he appeared through counsel before the
Trial Court and sought for an exemption. The Apex Court in
Niranjan Singh’s case (supra), held that when the accused
appeared and surrendered that he has been in custody and
hence the judgment will not come to the aid of the petitioner.
11.  This Court would like to refer to the judgment of this
Court in the case of S.R. Nagaraj v. State of Karnataka
reported in 2011 SCC OnLine Kar 3301, wherein, this Court
has observed that when a private complaint has been lodged and
after investigation charge-sheet has been filed, when the
petitioner after service of summons has appeared before the
Court   through   an   Advocate   and   has  filed  an   exemption
application. The petitioner instead of seeking bail before the Trial
Court has approached this Court under Section 438 of Cr.P.C.,
which is not maintainable.      The issue involved in the matter
before this Court is also similar to the facts of the case. In this
case also, the petitioner appeared through counsel and sought
for an exemption and the said exemption application was also
allowed and permitted to appear him through counsel and once
the Trial Court permitted the petitioner to appear through his
Counsel and allowed the application, the petitioner cannot invoke
Section 438 of Cr.P.C., and can invoke Section 439 of Cr.P.C., if
he does not appear before the Court and whether he had
appeared through Advocate or physically, is not the question and
once availed the benefit before the Trial Court appearing through
counsel and sought for an exemption and the same has been
entertained, question of invoking Section 438 of Cr.P.C., again
does not arise.
12.    This Court also would like to refer to the order of this
Court in the case of K. Somasekhar v. State of Karnataka
reported in 2015 SCC OnLine Kar 8412, wherein also similar
circumstances arises. This Court in paragraph No.3 referring to
the judgment of this Court in the case of Venkatachalaiah and
Others     v.   State   of   Karnataka,    by    Kadugodi     Police,
Bengaluru and others reported in ILR 2003 KAR 3985, and
the order in Criminal Petition No.23/2013, held that once the
accused appeared before the Trial Court and thereafter on
account of his absence on any later date warrant is issued by the
Court for deliberate absence is concerned, the remedy of
anticipatory bail under Section 438 Cr.P.C. is not available to
such person. However, liberty is reserved to the petitioner to file
necessary application before the Trial Court for recalling the
issuance of NBW.
13.    This Court also would like to refer to the Division
Bench Judgment of this Court in Venkatachalaiah’s case
(supra), wherein, discussed with regard to Sections 438(1) and
438(3) of Cr.P.C., and also held that even after filing of charge-
sheet also, the accused can approach the respective Courts
invoking Section 438 of Cr.P.C., but categorically held that in
paragraph No.27 that in the normal course where warrant is
issued in pursuance of filing charge-sheet or issuance of
summons and non-appearance of the party, the remedy under
Section 438(1) of Cr.P.C., is available. It is further observed that
however, we would like to emphasis that where in a criminal
proceeding a party has already appeared once or more than one
date and thereafter does not appear in the Court, the Court in
such circumstances issues non-bailable warrant and the said
warrant issued is in view of the defaulting conduct on the part of
the accused and in such cases a petitioner cannot invoke the
jurisdiction of the Court under Section 438(1) of Cr.P.C. and he
is bound to obey the court order or warrant by first appearing
before the Court and than by satisfying the Court as to the
sufficient cause for his absence, pray for bail under Section 439
14.   But in the case on hand, it is not in dispute that the
petitioner had appeared before the Trial Court through an
advocate and also filed an application under Section 205 of
Cr.P.C., instead of 317 of Cr.P.C., seeking an exemption for the
day. It is also not in dispute that the said application was
allowed. Once an application seeking an exemption was allowed,
the petitioner again cannot invoke Section 438 of Cr.P.C., and
instead of filing an application for recalling the warrant issued by
the Court for non-appearance has approached this Court and
also the Trial Court.    Apart from that, the appearance of the
petitioner before the Trial Court has been suppressed before this
Court and nowhere in the petition has stated that he had
appeared through the Counsel and only on perusal of the order
of the Trial Court, it is clear that he had appeared through the
Counsel and exemption application was allowed but he did not
appear before the Court. Hence, NBW was issued. When such
being the factual aspects of the case, once he appeared through
the Court, whether it is through Counsel or personally, he cannot
seek again anticipatory bail. The very contention of the learned
counsel for the petitioner is that the petitioner appeared before
the Trial Court through an Advocate is not amount to custody or
an arrest, cannot be accepted and he was permitted to appear
through Counsel and once permitted to appear through counsel
he cannot contend that he had not appeared physically.        The
petitioner legally permitted to appear and once he has been
permitted to appear legally he cannot contend that he was not
appeared before the Trial Court and hence petition under Section
438 of Cr.P.C., is not maintainable.
15.   The Apex Court also given interpretation with regard
to the custody and for invoking Section 439 of Cr.P.C., and not
for Section 438 of Cr.P.C., and also with regard to the meaning
of arrest discussed in Directorate of Enforcement v. Deepak
Mahajan and another ‘s case (supra), and not the question of
arrest before this Court also.    In the case on hand when the
private complaint was filed, the learned Magistrate took the
cognizance and issued the summons. In pursuance of the said
summons he appeared through the Counsel before the Trial
Court. Once he had appeared before the Trial Court he cannot
seek for an anticipatory bail again invoking under Section 438 of
Cr.P.C. This Court in S.R. Nagaraj and K. Somasekhar’s case
(supra), and also considering the principles laid down in
Venkatachalaiah’s case (supra), categorically held that once an
advocate appeared through counsel, he cannot seek for an
anticipatory bail again.    When such being the interpretation of
this Court and also the principle laid down in the judgments
referred supra, the petitioner cannot maintain any petition
invoking Section 438 of Cr.P.C. Hence, the petition is liable to
be dismissed.
16.   This Court does not want to consider the matter on
merits, whether he is entitled for anticipatory bail or not since
the very maintainability is questioned before this Court and this
Court comes to the conclusion that the petition under Section
438 of Cr.P.C., is not maintainable and an option is given to the
petitioner to approach before the Trial Court by filing necessary
application for recalling of the warrant issued against him as held
by this Court in K.Somasekhar’s case (supra), and seek
appropriate relief.
17.  In view of the discussions made above, I pass the
(i)  The    bail  petition  is  dismissed    as  not
maintainable.
(ii) The petitioner is given liberty to approach the
Trial Court by filing necessary application for
recalling the warrant issued against him.
