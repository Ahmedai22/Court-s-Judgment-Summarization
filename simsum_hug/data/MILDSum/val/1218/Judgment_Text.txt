Mr. P.P. Kakade, GP a/w Mr. M.M. Pabale, AGP for Respondent Nos.1 to 3-
1      The present PIL is filed with a prayer that Respondent Nos.2 and 3
should grant financial aid to all victims of snake and scorpion bites who are
residing in the State of Maharashtra without discrimination.
2      The learned Advocate for the Petitioner submits that the Government
of Maharashtra is giving financial aid to the victims of snake/scorpion bites
under Gopinath Mundhe Insurance Scheme only to farmers and their one
blood relative whose name appears in the 7/12 extract. The learned
Counsel submits that the Petitioner is a registered voluntary organization.
The Petitioner is authorized by the organization namely, Nisarga Vidnyan
Sanstha, Dombivli to file the present Petition. The Petitioner is the Secretary
k                                  2/4                 41 pil 107.22 as.doc
of the said Organization. The members of the said organization have hobby
to catch snakes and scorpion who enter human habitat. The learned
Counsel submits that there are many victims of snake bites who may not be
necessarily farmers. On one hand the State of Maharashtra is providing
financial aid to the farmers and their family members who succumb on
account of snake bite, at the same time the persons like the Petitioner who
catch the snakes/scorpion and get infected because of the same are not
provided with any financial aid. The same is discriminatory and violative of
Articles 14 and 21 of the Constitution of India.
3      The learned Counsel submits that such aid is provided by the State of
Madhya Pradesh under its policy of the year 2018. There is no reason for
the State of Maharashtra not to extend the benefit given to the farmers on
account of snake bite to the other citizens who also risk their life on account
of snake bite. The State of Maharashtra cannot adopt deal standards.
4      The learned AGP submits that the financial aid is given for loss of
human life or injury due to wild animals as per Government Resolution
dated 23rd August 2022. As per the said Government Resolution human
deaths caused due to bite of snake/scorpion are not listed for payment of
financial assistance. The State Government through Animal Husbandry,
Dairy   Development     and   Fisheries    Department    under        Government
k                                  3/4                 41 pil 107.22 as.doc
Resolution dated 19th September 2019 has taken a policy decision to
compensate the farmers and their family members against the risk of snake
bite through insurance coverage of Rs.2,00,000/- under the Gopinath
Munde Farmers Insurance Scheme. The said benefit is extended only to
land holding farmer and one member of the family.
5      We have considered the submissions. To grant financial aid is a
matter of policy decision to be taken by the State Government under Article
162 of the Constitution of India.
6      The policy framed for granting financial aid to the farmer and family
members of the farmer who succumb on account of the snake bite would
form a different class. The farmers are the ones who are in field. The
separate provision is made for them. The purpose of taking within its fold
the farmers who succumb to snake bite is that the farmers were already
covered by the earlier Government Resolutions by which compensation is
payable on account of the death or injury caused by wild animals.
Considering the welfare of the farmers, the decision has been taken to
extend the benefit of compensation even for snake bite.
7      This Court would be slow to give directions with regard to the fiscal
policies of the State Government. Whether a particular scheme is to be
applied to a particular group of persons is a policy decision that is to be
k                                     4/4                  41 pil 107.22 as.doc
under taken by the Government. The State Government under its wisdom
has considered farmers to form a different class than the other citizens and
the benevolent scheme has been floated for the farmers.
8         It is for the State Government to consider the grievances put-forth by
the Petitioner with regard to providing the compensation to the other
persons who succumb due to snake bite. This Court would not direct the
Government to make a policy in a particular manner as that would amount
to encroaching upon the jurisdiction of the State Government conferred the
Article 162 of the Constitution of India.
9         With the aforesaid observations, the PIL is disposed of.
