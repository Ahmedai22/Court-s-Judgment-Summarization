2.      By these petitions, petitioners challenge the Order dated
20th      December,    2022    passed    by    the   Maharashtra
Administrative Tribunal, Mumbai (Tribunal) in Original
Application Nos.775 of 2022, 776 of 2022, 777 of 2022, 778 of
2022, 779 of 2022, 793 of 2022, 796 of 2022 & 830 of 2022 by
which the Tribunal has proceeded to recall its earlier
Judgment and Order dated 11th April, 2022 passed in Original
Application Nos. 144 of 2022, 145 of 2022, 146 of 2022, 167 of
2022, 203 of 2022, 300 of 2022, 301 of 2022, 321 of 2022.
The petitioners also challenge common Order dated 22 nd
December, 2022 passed in both sets of Original Applications
wp 226.2023 (J) (f).doc
(OA No.775/2022 & other connected OAs and OA No.144 of
2022 & other connected OAs) to a larger Bench.
3.      Brief facts of the case are that the recruitment process
for the post of Police Constable (Driver) was initiated by the
Additional Director General of Police, (M.S), Mumbai vide
Advertisement dated 30th November, 2019. The recruitment
process was apparently to be conducted in respect of the
separate     Units /    Districts.   The Applicants   in Original
Application No.144 of 2022 & other connected OAs filled up
forms in respect of multiple Units / Districts and also appeared
for multiple examinations. Though their names were included
in the merit list, the same were subsequently deleted from the
revised merit list for the reason of their participation in
selection process in more than one Unit/District. Challenging
deletion of their names from the revised merit list, Original
Application Nos.144 of 2022, 145 of 2022, 146 of 2022, 167 of
2022, 203 of 2022, 300 of 2022, 301 of 2022, 321 of 2022
were instituted by such candidates before the Tribunal. In
those Original Applications, though relief was sought for
inclusion of their names in the merit list and consequential
appointment to the post of Police Constable (Driver), the
wp 226.2023 (J) (f).doc
candidates that were likely to be affected by grant of such
reliefs were not impleaded as parties to those Original
4.      The Tribunal proceeded to allow Original Application
No.144 of 2022 & ors, by common judgment and order dated
11th April, 2022 directing consideration of candidature of
applicants therein in further process of selection by setting
aside deletion of their names from the merit list.
5.      The State Government proceeded to implement the
Tribunal’s judgment and order dated 11 th April, 2022 and it
appears that, names of some of the candidates got deleted from
the merit list and orders terminating them from service came
to be issued. This led to filing of Original Application Nos. 775
of 2022, 776 of 2022, 777 of 2022, 778 of 2022, 779 of 2022,
793 of 2022, 796 of 2022 & 830 of 2022. During the course of
hearing of those OAs, the Tribunal noticed that implementation
of its Judgment and order dated 11th April, 2022 passed in OA
No.144 of 2022 & ors, was the reason for termination of
services of the applicants in OA No.775 of 2022 & ors. The
Tribunal therefore proceeded to pass Order dated 20 th
wp 226.2023 (J) (f).doc
December, 2022 recalling its Judgment and order dated 11 th
April, 2022 passed in OA No.144 of 2022 & ors and restored all
those Original Applications on its file.
6.      The Tribunal thereafter took up both sets of Original
Applications (OA Nos.144 of 2022 & ors and OA Nos. 775 of
2022 & ors) for hearing on 22 nd December, 2022 and
proceeded to refer all Original Applications for decision to a
larger Bench of three learned Members.
7.      The petitioners in the present petitions are aggrieved by
Orders dated 20th December, 2022 and 22nd December, 2022
passed by the Tribunal.
8.      Appearing for the petitioners, Mr. Dere and Mr.
Deshmukh, the learned counsels would submit that while
hearing OA No.775 of 2022 & ors, the Tribunal had no occasion
to decide the issue of validity of its Judgment and order dated
11th April, 2022 passed in OA No.144 of 2022 & ors. It is
further submitted that while passing order of recall dated 20th
December, 2022, the applicants in OA No.144 of 2022 & ors,
were not heard and the Order passed in their favour has been
wp 226.2023 (J) (f).doc
recalled behind their back. It is further submitted that no case
is made out by the Applicants in OA No.775 of 2022 & ors,
though they came to be affected only on account of passing of
the Judgment & order dated 11th April,2022 in OA No.144 of
2022 & ors. They would also contend that if the Tribunal was
of the view that reference to larger Bench was warranted, it
ought to have first distinguished its earlier decision dated 11 th
April 2022 by recording reasons and then made an order of
reference. That no specific question is formulated by the
Tribunal while making order of reference. Lastly, it is
submitted that the Applicants in OA No.144 of 2022 & ors,
have already been appointed in pursuance of the Judgment
and Order dated 11th April, 2022 and effect of recalling of the
said order would entail termination of their services.
9.      Per contra, Mr. Pranav Avhad and Ms. Purva Pradhan,
the learned counsels appearing for Applicants in OA Nos.775 of
2022 & ors would oppose the Petitions and support the Order
passed by the Tribunal. They would submit that the Judgment
and Order dated 11th April, 2022 was erroneously passed by
the Tribunal in OA No.144 of 2022 & ors, without hearing the
candidates who were already selected and appointed and that
wp 226.2023 (J) (f).doc
the Tribunal has merely corrected the error by recalling its
order dated 11th April 2022 for the purpose of affording an
opportunity of hearing the affected candidates. It is further
submitted that reference of the issue to the Larger Bench
would enable the Tribunal to effectively decide the lis between
the competing parties.
10.     We have also heard, learned AGP appearing on behalf of
11.     There are competing claims of candidates participating
in selection in multiple Units/Districts and those participating
only in one Unit/District. When OA No.144 of 2022 & ors, were
instituted by the candidates appearing for examination in
multiple Units/Districts, the merit lists were already declared.
Names of selected candidates were already known. Therefore,
while challenging such merit lists and seeking inclusion of
their names therein, it was incumbent on such candidates to
include     atleast some    of    the  selected  candidates            in
representative capacity for affording them an opportunity of
defending those OAs. However, without impleading any of the
selected candidates, OA No.144 of 2022 & ors came to be
wp 226.2023 (J) (f).doc
instituted. The Tribunal proceeded to allow those OAs by its
Judgment and order dated 11th April, 2022 setting aside
deletion of names of applicants from the merit list and
directing consideration of their candidature in further
selection process.
12.     We feel that the course of action adopted by the Tribunal
in entertaining OA Nos, 144 of 2022 & Ors without
impleadment of affected selected candidates was against the
well settled principles enunciated in various judgments of the
Apex Court. A reference in this regard can be made to the
Judgment in Ranjan Kumar v. State of Bihar 1, in which the
Apex Court has held as under:
7. In Rashmi Mishra v. M.P. Public Service Commission [Rashmi
Mishra v. M.P. Public Service Commission, (2006) 12 SCC 724 :
(2007) 2 SCC (L&S) 345] , after referring to Prabodh Verma [Pra-
bodh Verma v. State of U.P., (1984) 4 SCC 251 : 1984 SCC (L&S)
704] and Indu Shekhar Singh [Indu Shekhar Singh v. State of U.P.,
(2006) 8 SCC 129 : 2006 SCC (L&S) 1916] , the Court took note of
the fact that when no steps had been taken in terms of Order 1 Rule
8 of the Code of Civil Procedure or the principles analogous thereto
all the seventeen selected candidates were necessary parties in the
writ petition. It was further observed that the number of selected
candidates was not many and there was no difficulty for the appel-
lant to implead them as parties in the proceeding. Ultimately, the
Court held that when all the selected candidates were not im-
pleaded as parties to the writ petition, no relief could be granted to
the appellant therein.
8. In Tridip Kumar Dingal v. State of W.B. [Tridip Kumar Din-
gal v. State of W.B., (2009) 1 SCC 768 : (2009) 2 SCC (L&S) 119] ,
this Court approved the view expressed by the tribunal which had
opined that for absence of selected and appointed candidates and
without affording an opportunity of hearing to them, the selection
could not be set aside.
13. In view of the aforesaid enunciation of law, we are disposed to
think that in such a case when all the appointees were not im-
pleaded, the writ petition was defective and hence, no relief could
have been granted to the writ petitioners.
(emphasis supplied)
13.     It may well be contended that it is not possible to implead
each and every selected candidate, however atleast some of
them in representative capacity ought to have been impleaded.
This aspect has been expounded by the Apex Court in its re-
cent judgment in Ajay Kumar Shukla and Others Vs. Arvind
Rai and Others2 in which it is held as under:
46. In the recent case of Mukul Kumar Tyagi and Ors. vs. The State
of Uttar Pradesh and Ors.,14 Ashok Bhushan, J., laid emphasis that
when there is a long list of candidates against whom the case is pro-
ceeded, then it becomes unnecessary and irrelevant to implead
each and every candidate. If some of the candidates are impleaded
then they will be said to be representing the interest of rest of the
candidates as well. The relevant portion of paragraph 75 from the
judgment is reproduced below:
“75...... We may further notice that Division Bench also no-
ticed the above argument of non-impleadment of all the se-
lected candidates in the writ petition but Division Bench has
not based its judgment on the above argument. When the in-
clusion in the select list of large number of candidates is on
the basis of an arbitrary or illegal process, the aggrieved par-
ties can complain and in such cases necessity of implead-
ment of each and every person cannot be insisted. Further-
more, when select list contained names of 2211 candidates, it
becomes unnecessary to implead every candidate in view of
the nature of the challenge, which was levelled in the writ pe-
tition. Moreover, few selected candidates were also im-
pleaded in the writ petitions in representative capacity.”
47. The present case is a case of preparation of seniority list and
that too in a situation where the appellants (original writ petition-
ers) did not even know the marks obtained by them or their profi-
ciency in the examination conducted by the Commission. The chal-
lenge was on the ground that the Rules on the preparation of senior-
ity list had not been followed. There were 18 private respondents
arrayed to the writ petition. The original petitioners could not have
known who all would be affected. They had thus broadly impleaded
18 of such Junior Engineers who could be adversely affected. In
matters relating to service jurisprudence, time and again it has
been held that it is not essential to implead each and every one who
could be affected but if a section of such affected employees is im-
pleaded then the interest of all is represented and protected. In
view of the above, it is well settled that impleadment of a few of the
affected employees would be sufficient compliance of the principle of
joinder of parties and they could defend the interest of all affected
persons in their representative capacity. Non-joining of all the par-
ties cannot be held to be fatal.”
14.     When the Tribunal proceeded to pass the Judgment and
order dated 11th April, 2022, the same resulted in deletion of
names of some of the candidates from the merit list and many
of them were required to be terminated from service. This led
to filing of OA No.775 of 2022 & ors. by such candidates. This
situation could have been avoided, if such candidates were
impleaded to OA No.144 of 2022 & ors.
15.     The Tribunal was thus faced with a situation where it had
already allowed OA Nos.144 of 2022 & ors. by its Judgment
wp 226.2023 (J) (f).doc
and order dated 11th April, 2022 without hearing candidates
who got adversely affected by it. Such affected candidates were
required to institute OA Nos.775 of 2022 & ors. If the Tribunal
was to allow OA Nos.775 of 2022 & ors, the same would have
resulted in conflicting judgments in respect of same selection.
The course of action to be adopted in a situation like this is
stated by the Apex Court in its Judgment in the case of K. Ajit
Babu and Others V. Union of India and Others 3. In Paragraph 6
of the Judgment, the Apex Court has held as under;
“4. ……. Often in service matters the judgments rendered either by
the Tribunal or by the Court also affect other persons, who are not
parties to the cases. It may help one class of employees and at the
same time adversely affect another class of employees. In such
circumstances the judgments of the courts or the tribunals may not
be strictly judgments in personam affecting only the parties to the
cases, they would be judgments in rem. In such a situation, the
question arises: What remedy is available to such affected persons
who are not parties to a case, yet the decision in such a case
adversely affects their rights in the matter of their seniority…….
5. The Tribunal rejected the application of the appellant merely on
the ground that the appellant was seeking setting aside of the
judgment rendered by the Central Administrative Tribunal,
Ahmedabad in the case of P.S. John (supra) in TA No. 263 of 1986.
It is here that the Tribunal apparently fell in error. No doubt the
decision of the Tribunal in the case P.S. John was against the
appellant but the application filed by the appellant under Section 19
of the Act has to be dealt with in accordance with law.
6. Consistency, certainty and uniformity in the field of
judicial decisions are considered to be the benefits arising
out of the “Doctrine of Precedent”. The precedent sets a
pattern upon which a future conduct may be based. One of
the basic principles of administration of justice is, that the
cases should be decided alike. Thus the doctrine of
wp 226.2023 (J) (f).doc
precedent is applicable to the Central Administrative
Tribunal also. Whenever an application under Section 19 of
the Act is filed and the question involved in the said
application stands concluded by some earlier decision of
the Tribunal, the Tribunal necessarily has to take into
account the judgment rendered in the earlier case, as a
precedent and decide the application accordingly. The
Tribunal may either agree with the view taken in the
earlier judgment or it may dissent. If it dissents, then the
matter can be referred to a larger Bench/Full Bench and
place the matter before the Chairman for constituting a
larger Bench so that there may be no conflict upon the two
Benches. The larger Bench, then, has to consider the
correctness of the earlier decision in disposing of the later
application. The larger Bench can overrule the view taken
in the earlier judgment and declare the law, which would
be binding on all the benches (see John Lucas1). In the
present case, what we find is that the Tribunal rejected the
application of the appellants thinking that the appellants
are seeking setting aside of the decision of the Tribunal in
Transfer Application No.263 of 1986. This view taken by
the Tribunal was not correct. The application of the
appellant was required to be decided in accordance with
law.”
16.     Similar proposition is laid down by the Apex Court in its
judgment in Gopabandhu Biswal v. Krishna Chandra Mohanty4,
in which it is held in Para 11 as under:
11. According to the applicants certain documents though produced
before the Tribunal were not noticed by the Tribunal in deciding the
main matter. Even so, once a judgment of a Tribunal has attained fi-
nality, it cannot be reopened after the special leave petition against
that judgment has been dismissed. The only remedy for a person
who wants to challenge that judgment is to file a separate applica-
tion before the Tribunal in his own case and persuade the Tribunal
either to refer the question to a larger Bench or, if the Tribunal
prefers to follow its earlier decision, to file an appeal from the Tri-
bunal's judgment and have the Tribunal's judgment set aside in ap-
peal. A review is not an available remedy.
(emphasis supplied)
17.     Thus, following the Judgment in K. Ajit Babu and
Gopabandhu Biswal (supra), the candidates who were
adversely affected by the Judgment and Order dated 11th April,
2022 rightly instituted fresh Original Applications (OA
Nos.775 of 2022 & ors). However what is not done by the
Tribunal was to follow mandate of the Judgments of the Apex
Court in K. Ajit Babu and Gopabandhu Biswal. It ought to have
proceeded to decide OA Nos.775 of 2022 & ors by directing
impleadment of all Applicants of OA Nos. 144/2022 & Ors.
thereto. If after hearing all the parties, the Tribunal was to
arrive at a conclusion that the view taken by it in its earlier
order dated 11th April 2022 was correct, OA Nos.775 of 2022 &
ors could be dismissed. On the other hand, if the Tribunal was
to disagree with the view taken in its order dated 11 th April
2022, OA Nos.775 of 2022 & ors would then be referred to
larger Bench of three learned Members. This is the mandate of
judgments in K. Ajit Babu and Gopabandhu Biswal.
18.     The Tribunal however adopted procedure unknown to
law by recalling its order dated 11 th April 2022 passed in OA
No.144 of 2022 & ors while hearing OA No.775 of 2022 & ors.
wp 226.2023 (J) (f).doc
it is incomprehensible as to how the Tribunal could have
passed any order in OA Nos. 144/2022 & ors while hearing
altogether different OAs. To make things worse, the order of
recall was passed behind the back of Applicants of OA Nos.
144/2022 & Ors. We find that there was no necessity for the
Tribunal to recall Judgment and order dated 11 th April, 2022.
Instead, the Tribunal ought to have simply directed the
Applicants of OA Nos.775 of 2022 & ors, to implead all the
applicants of OA No.144 of 2022 & ors, as party-respondents
and after hearing them, ought to have decided OA No.775 of
2022 & ors. If it was to agree with the view taken in its
Judgment and Order dated 11th April, 2022, it could have
dismissed OA No.775 of 2022 & ors. On the other hand, if the
Tribunal was to form an opinion that a view taken in OA No.144
of 2022 & ors was erroneous, it could have proceeded to refer
OA No.775 of 2022 & ors to larger Bench following the
mandate of the Judgments in K. Ajit Babu and Gopabandhu
Biswal. The erroneous procedure for making a reference to
larger Bench by recalling order in OA 144/2022 & Ors seems to
have been adopted by the Tribunal as the Judgments in K. Ajit
Babu and Gopabandhu Biswal were possibly not cited before it.
wp 226.2023 (J) (f).doc
19.     We are thus not in agreement with the procedure
adopted by the Tribunal in recalling its Judgment and Order
dated 11th April, 2022 for the purpose of referring both set of
Original Applications to a larger Bench. However, at the same
time, though the procedure adopted by the Tribunal does not
commend us, we do not find any reason to interfere in the
ultimate decision of the Tribunal to refer the Original
Applications to a larger Bench. True it is that the Tribunal
ought to have first recorded a finding for disagreement with
the view taken in its order dated 11th April 2022 and then
make an order of reference to a larger Bench. It also ought to
have formulated the exact issue for reference. However since
much water has flown by now, it would not be appropriate to
set aside the impugned orders and to relegate the matter back
to the Tribunal for following the correct procedure for making
reference as mandated in K. Ajit Babu. Since the reference is
already made to larger Bench and since both the sets of parties
are already before the Tribunal, ends of justice would meet if
the larger Bench of the Tribunal is permitted to decide the
controversy before it.
20.     It also appears that there is another decision rendered by
the bench of the Tribunal at Nagpur on 31 st March 2022. This
is yet another reason why the larger Bench of the Tribunal
decides the subject matter pending before it. The decision of
the larger Bench would prevail over all past decisions rendered
by the Division Benches of the Tribunal at various Benches.
Therefore, though we are not in agreement with the procedure
adopted      by   the  Tribunal   while   referring  the     Original
Applications to a larger Bench, we are not inclined to interfere
in the impugned orders. However, it is made clear that our
decision is in view of the peculiar facts and circumstances of
the present case and the same shall not be construed to mean
that the course of action adopted by the Tribunal in recalling
the Judgment and Order dated 11th April, 2022 is approved by
us in any manner. Nor this judgment shall be treated as a
21.     The present petitioners claim to have been appointed on
the post of Police Constable (Driver) in pursuance of the
Judgment and Order dated 11 th April, 2022 passed in OA
No.144 of 2022 & ors. Since the Judgment and Order dated
11th April, 2022 is already recalled, the same may affect the
wp 226.2023 (J) (f).doc
appointments of the petitioners. We are informed that the
larger Bench of the Tribunal has commenced the hearing of
both set of the Original Applications on 5 th January, 2023.
Since the larger Bench is already seized of the Original
Applications, it would be in the fitness of the things if status
with regard to the appointments of the petitioners is
maintained till the larger Bench of the Tribunal finally takes
decision in the Original Applications.
22. We therefore do not find any valid reason to interfere with
the orders passed by the Tribunal on 20th December 2022 and
22nd December 2022 and the present petitions must fail to that
extent. The only interference which we propose to make is to
protect the status of service of the Petitioners during pendency
of proceedings before the larger bench,
23.     We accordingly proceed to pass the following order :-
(a) Till the matter is decided by the larger Bench, status
quo as on today be maintained.
(b) In view of the fact that the matter is referred to the
larger Bench, we request to the Tribunal (larger
wp 226.2023 (J) (f).doc
Bench) to hear the matter expeditiously considering
the issues involved.
(c) All contentions of respective parties are kept open.
24.     The Writ Petitions stand disposed of accordingly. Rule
stands discharged.
