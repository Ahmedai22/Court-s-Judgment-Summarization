For Petitioner(s)       :  Mr. Pushkar Taiminee for Mr. Sanjay
The instant petition under Section 24 of the Code of
Civil Procedure has been filed by the petitioner - wife seeking
transfer of petition filed against respondent – husband under
Section 9 of Hindu Marriage Act, presently pending in the court of
Additional District Judge – Family Court, Chirawa, Jhunjhunu to
Averments made in the petition are as under:-
Petitioner -wife got married with the respondent –
husband in the year 2007 as per Hindu rites and rituals. Out of
their wedlock, two children being a boy and a girl were born.
Respondent gave beating to the petitioner and involved in adultery
also. For one such incident, petitioner registered a complaint at
Mahila Police Station, Bhilwara on 21.8.2020. Respondent filed an
application under Section 9 of the Hindu Marriage Act before the
Additional District Judge, Chirawa for restitution of conjugal rights
(2 of 4)           [CTA-87/2020]
for which Court issued notice to the petitioner. Petitioner has also
filed application under Section 13(1) of Hindu Marriage Act for
declaring   her   marriage   null   and    void and  application   for
maintenance under Section 125 of Cr.P.C. Petitioner also filed an
application under Sections 9 and 37 of Protection of Women from
Domestic Violence Act, 2005. There is constant threat perception
in the mind of the petitioner that the respondent may cause harm
either to the petitioner or her children and parents. Therefore, it is
very difficult for the petitioner to appear and contest the case
pending before the Court at Chirawa, Jhunjhunu. Petitioner resides
at Bhilwara and works at Chittorgarh. The children of the
petitioner are minor and require constant attention of the
petitioner as there is no one else in the family to look after them.
Petitioner cannot leave her children alone even for a single day
and attend the case at Chirawa, Jhunjhunu. It would be
appropriate that application for restitution of conjugal rights filed
by the respondent pending before the learned Additional District
Judge – Family Court, Chirawa be heard by the learned Family
Court, Bhilwara before whom application under Section 13(1) of
Hindu Marriage Act for declaring marriage null and void is also
pending. Petition has been supported by the affidavit.
In reply to the transfer petition, respondent – husband
has denied allegations made against him. As per him, petitioner
lodged the FIR on frivolous grounds only to harass him. Father of
the respondent has also lodged an FIR before the Judicial
Magistrate, Chirawa. Respondent is jobless. He loves his children
and can never threaten or harm them. Petitioner has not come
with true and correct facts. Petitioner travels daily from Bhilwara
to Sinhana, Chittorgarh to discharge her duties as a Teacher
(3 of 4)           [CTA-87/2020]
without any complaint. Her entire case is based only on travelling
difficulties and no other substantial reason has been stated by the
petitioner for filing transfer petition.
Learned counsel for the petitioner relied upon the
following judgments:-
(1) Sangeeta Alias Shreya vs. Prasant Vijay Wargiya : 2004
(2) Vibha Jain vs. Naresh Kumar Somiya : 2018 3 DNJ 1251
On the other hand, learned counsel for the respondent
submits that transfer petition filed by the petitioner cannot be
allowed only on the ground that she is a lady and inconvenience
will cause to her for travelling from Bhilwara to Chirawa, District
Jhunjhunu. Learned counsel for the respondent also submits that
the petitioner would be paid expenses for her travelling and stay
at Chirawa. Learned counsel for the respondent relied on the
following judgments:
(1) Gayatri Mohapatra vs. Ashit Kumar Panda : (2003) 11
(2) M. Sivagami vs. R. Raja : (2005) 12 SCC 301
(3) Kanagalakshmi vs. A. Venkatesan : (2004) 13 SCC 405
Having regard to the submissions made by the learned
counsel for the parties and after perusal of the record it reveals
that the petitioner is working woman and mother of two minor
children. Her present place of posting is at Sinhana, Chittorgarh.
Respondent – husband has filed the application under Section 9 of
Hindu Marriage Act for restitution of conjugal rights against the
petitioner – wife in the Court of Additional District Judge – Family
Court, Chirawa, Jhunjhunu, which is far away from Bhilwara.
Record     also  reveals   that  application    seeking declaring  the
(4 of 4)              [CTA-87/2020]
marriage between the parties null and void is also pending in the
Looking to the facts and circumstances of the present
case, this Court is of the opinion that this transfer petition
deserves to be allowed. Petitioner is a lady, who will face
difficulties to travel for long distance with her minor children. As
per the version of the learned counsel for the petitioner, there is
no one in the family who can look after her children in the absence
of mother. Great inconvenience will be caused to minor children of
the petitioner, if the petitioner leaves her children at Bhilwara.
Petitioner being a working woman has multiple duties to perform.
Other litigation between the parties are pending at Bhilwara. In
the above circumstances, more inconvenience will be caused if
case is not transferred from Chirawa, Jhunjhunu to Bhilwara in
comparison to the inconvenience caused to the respondent.
Resultantly, the instant transfer petition is allowed. Civil
Original    Case   No.  73/2020    pending      before pending     before
Additional District Judge – Family Court, Chirawa, Jhunjhunu is
ordered to be transferred to the Family Court, Bhilwara.
Let the parties shall appear before the Family Court,
Bhilwara on 7.4.2022 and thereafter, the Family Court, Bhilwara
would regulate the hearing.
A copy of this order be sent to the Additional District
Judge - Family Court, Chirawa, Jhunjhunu as well as Family Court,
Bhilwara for information and necessary compliance.
