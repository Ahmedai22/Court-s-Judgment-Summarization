The Allahabad High Court has issued a show-cause notice to a Police Officer for misleading the Court by supplying false and incorrect information regarding a police station which is not in existence.
 Justice JJ Munir has issued notice to Amit Kumar, Sub-Inspector of Police, Police Station Kotwali, District Bijnor who informed the Court (through AGA) that a case was registered against a man in Akbarabad police station (Amroha), even though there is no such police station in existence.
 The Court found that the officer supplied false and incorrect instructions to the Government Advocate that there was a case registered against a man under the U.P. Gangsters Act, Police Station Akbarabad, however, there is no police station by that name in existence in District Amroha.
 The Court has directed him to remain present in the office of the Government Advocate on July 8.
 Background
 It was submitted by the Counsel for the applicant that the applicant had become the victim of an overenthusiastic action by a mysterious group of policemen, who are constituted into Special Operation Groups. 
 It was further stated that he had been arrested from home and falsely foisted with the recovery of some cars along with motorcycles, along with a number of other co-accused. 
 Filing a supplementary affidavit, the applicant stated that there was no case registered against him under Section 3(1) of the U.P. Gangsters Act with Police Station Akbarabad, District Amroha, as alleged. Importantly, it was stated that in fact there was no Police Station by the name of Police Station Akbarabad in the district of Amroha.
 Before the Court, even the A.G.A. didn't dispute the fact that there was no police station by that name in District Amroha. 
 Thus, the Court issued him a notice stating:
 "â€¦show cause why appropriate action may not be initiated against him for misleading the Court by supplying false and incorrect instructions to the learned Government Advocate in that, that there is no case crime under Section 3(1) of the U.P. Gangsters Act, Police Station Akbarabad, District Amroha against the applicant, so much so, that there is no police station by that name in existence in District Amroha."
