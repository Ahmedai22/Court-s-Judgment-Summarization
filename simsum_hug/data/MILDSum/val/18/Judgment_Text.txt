These cross appeals are directed against the order passed by
Ld. CIT(A)-5, Bengaluru and they relate to the assessment year
2.     These appeals were earlier disposed of by this bench of
Tribunal vide its order dated 2.12.2016. The assessee challenged
the order passed by the Tribunal by filing appeal before Hon’ble
High Court of Karnataka. The Hon’ble High Court has restored the
matter back to the file of the Tribunal with the following
“8.     From close scrutiny of the order passed by the Tribunal, it
is evident that the tribunal while deciding the appeal preferred by
the revenue has adjudicated only grounds 2 and 3 and has not
adjudicated the ground with regard to the claim of assessee under
Section 54F of the Act in the light of law laid down by Delhi High
Court in ‘CIT Vs. GITA DUGGA’, (2013) 257 CTR (DEL.) 208.
The Tribunal has failed to adjudicate the grounds raised by the
assessee in her appeal. The impugned order therefore, cannot be
sustained in the eye of law. It is accordingly quashed. The matter
is remitted to the tribunal to decide the appeal preferred by the
assessee as well as the revenue afresh in accordance with law laid
down by this Court in NAVIN JOLLY, GITA DUGGAL, M.
WAHAL supra. It is therefore, not necessary for us to answer the
substantial questions of law.”
We notice that the Hon’ble High Court has directed the Tribunal to
decide the appeals afresh.
3.     At the time of hearing, both the parties admitted that the tax
effect involved in the appeal filed by the revenue is below the
monetary limit as prescribed by the CBDT in its circular
No.17/2019 dated 8.8.2019. Accordingly, the appeal of the revenue
is dismissed in limine.
4.     The only issue urged in the appeal of the assessee relates to
partial rejection of deduction claimed u/s 54F of the Income-tax
Act,1961 ['the Act' for short].
5.     The facts relating to the issue are stated in brief.           The
assessee is an individual and she filed her return of income for the
year under consideration on 29.9.2008 declaring a total income of
Rs.9,06,860/-. The assessee had earned long term capital gain of
Rs.1,56,85,225/- on sale of a land and claimed exemption u/s 54F
of the Act from it to the extent of Rs.1,56,33,870/-. Accordingly,
the assessee offered net long term capital gain of Rs.51,355/-.
6.     The A.O. examined the long-term capital gain declared by the
assessee.    It was noticed that the assessee along with 3 other
persons had sold a property on 27.10.2007 for a consideration of
Rs.5.35 crores.     The assessee’s share out of the above said
consideration was Rs.1,60,50,000/-. The assessee claimed that she
has purchased a residential house property in a project named
“M/s. Prestige Ozone” for a sum of Rs.1,72,29,993/-. Accordingly,
she claimed deduction u/s 54F of the Act to the extent of
7.     The A.O. examined the details of purchase of the property at
Prestige Ozone.   The A.O. noticed that the initial agreement was
entered by the assessee’s husband Shri Y.C. Rami Reddy with M/s
Prestige Properties on 5.5.2004 for construction of         building at a
cost of Rs.46,35,610/-. Subsequently, a sale deed was registered
on 24.2.2007 for purchase of plot No.8 having extent of Rs.6,108
sq.ft. for a consideration of Rs.39,67,933/-, on which the above
said construction has happened. The said sale deed was executed
in favour of Shri Y.C. Rami Reddy and the assessee herein. The
assessee claimed that she has reimbursed all the payments made
by her husband to him and she also incurred further expenses for
interior design, etc.  Accordingly, the assessee claimed that the
entire cost of purchase was met by her and further, the property
was purchased by her from her husband. The breakup details of
total expenses incurred in connection with this property was stated
Cost of land as per agreement dt 5.5.04                          Rs.39,69,933.00
Cost of Construction as per agreement dt. 5.5.2004               Rs.46,35,210.00
Common Maintenance Charges as per clause 8(b)                       Rs.87,500.00
Common Maintenance Charges as per cluse 8(d)                        Rs.87,500.00
Payment made to Prestige and other structural changes            Rs.34,17,560.00
Payment made to Morph Design vide letter dt 6.3.2007             Rs.30,66,252.00
for changes in the villa
Material purchased and supplied by the assessee                   Rs.7,89,677.00
Cost of registration of land on 24.02.2007                        Rs.3.77,540.00
Other costs                                                       Rs.8,98,421.00
8.      The A.O. examined the cost of purchase of property furnished
to him and noticed that the assessee could not furnish evidence
with regard to the expenses incurred on interiors, etc. Accordingly,
the A.O. held that the cost of acquisition should be taken as
Rs.91,57,683/- only as given below:-
1. Cost of land vide sale deed dt 24.2.2007             – Rs.39,69,933.00
2. Cost of construction vide agreement dt.5.5.2004      – Rs.46,35,210.00
3. Common maintenance charges vide clause 8(b)&(d) - Rs. 1,75,000.00
4. Cost of registration of land on 24.2.2007             - Rs. 3,77,540.00
Total cost of acquisition                            - Rs.91,57,683.00
9.      The A.O. also examined the claim of the assessee for
deduction u/s 54F of the Act.             The A.O. took the view that the
assessee is not eligible for deduction u/s 54F of the Act for the
following reasons:-
1. The assessee has already held 50% share in the Prestige
Ozone building and hence, there was no necessity for her to
pay the full consideration of Rs.1.72 crores to her husband.
2. The husband has relinquished his right in favour of the
assessee on 3.1.2008 by way of an unregistered document,
which       was     subsequently        registered     on     25.1.2010.
Accordingly, the assessee cannot be considered to have
purchased new house within one year before the date of
transfer.
3. The assessee has got more than one residential house at the
time of sale of the land as given below:-
a) Property at 19/1, Outer Ring Road, Penathur Junction,
b) A residential house in Ooty.
4. The assessee has also advanced money to purchase another
flat at M/s. Prestige Knotting Hill on 8.6.2007. Purchase of
another new house within 3 years is in violation of third
proviso to Section 54F of the Act, which would disentitle the
assessee for deduction u/s 54F of the Act.
5. The assessee became absolute owner of the building in
Prestige Ozone only on 25.1.2010.
Accordingly, the A.O. rejected the claim for deduction u/s 54F of
10.    Before Ld. CIT(A), the assessee filed detailed submissions.
The assessee also submitted that the sale consideration should be
reduced by an amount of Rs.26,75,000/-. It was submitted that
the above said amount represented sale value of a portion of land
gifted by assessee’s son to her. However, in the assessment of the
assessee’s son, the above said amount of Rs.26.75 lakhs was
included for computing capital gain disregarding the claim of gift to
the assessee herein. Accordingly, it was prayed that the above said
amount should be reduced from the value of sale consideration
offered by the assessee, since it has already been assessed in the
hands of the assessee.        Since the assessee has made detailed
explanations with regard to the various observations made by the
A.O, the Ld. CIT(A) called for a remand report from the A.O.
11.     The assessee submitted she does not own the property
mentioned in her return of income as located at Outer Ring Road.
It was submitted that the rental income shown against that
property was actually received from the property purchased in
Prestige Ozone and the mistake has happened due to typographical
mistake. We notice this fact was accepted by the tax authorities.
12.    (a) With regard to the residential flat located in Ooty, the A.O.
observed in the remand report that it consisted of 3 residential
buildings and hence, the condition prescribed in section 54F of the
Act is violated.
(b) The AO reiterated that the assessee has given advance
for purchase of a flat at Prestige Nottingghill, which is a violation of
the one of the conditions prescribed in sec. 54F of the Act. Hence
the assessee is not eligible for deduction.
(c) The AO accepted the fact that the sale consideration of
Rs.26.75 lakhs was assessed in the hands of the assessee’s son.
13.        In the reply to the remand report, the assessee submitted
that the assessing officer is taking the view that there are three
residential house properties in Ooty for the first time.             It was
submitted that it is a single building having three units in ground
floor, 1st and 2nd Floor. The assessee also submitted that she has
furnished bills for interior works to the maximum extent possible
and she could not furnish evidences to the extent of Rs.16,97,098/-
, which agreed for disallowance.
14.     The Ld. CIT(A) after considering the remand report as well as
the reply given by the assessee to the remand report gave his
decision as under:-
a) The residential flat located at Ooty is a single residential
building consisted of 3 residential units. Accordingly, he held
that the residential building at Ooty should be considered as
a single house property.
b) With regard to advance given by assessee for purchase of flat
at Prestige Knotting Hill, the Ld. CIT(A) held that mere giving
advance will not result in acquisition of any house property.
Hence, it cannot be said that the third proviso to section 54F
of the Act is violated.
15.    With regard to the cost of acquisition of the building, the Ld.
CIT(A) took the view that
(a)  the   expenditure    incurred     on   interiors,  renovation,
furnishing, etc. after registration of plot i.e. after 24.2.2007 cannot
be taken as part of cost of acquisition.
(b) the assessee has purchased only 50% of right from her
husband on 27.10.2007 and she has already held 50% earlier. The
Release deed given by husband of the assessee was registered on
25.1.2010, which is 3 years from the date of sale of original
property.      Accordingly, the Ld. CIT(A) took the view that,
irrespective of the amount of payment made to her husband, the
assessee can be said to have acquired only 50% of the property on
25.1.2010, which falls within 3 years from the date of sale of
original property. Accordingly, he took the view that the deduction
u/s 54F of the Act shall be available to the assessee only to 50% of
cost of acquisition of asset.
(c)   Since the Ld CIT(A) took the view that the expenses
incurred    after  24.2.2007    cannot    be    considered    as   part   of
acquisition of property, he computed the cost of acquisition as
Cost of construction              -      Rs.46,35,610/-
Cost of land as per sale deed -          Rs.43,47,473/-
Maintenance charges               -      Rs. 1,75,000/-
Accordingly, the Ld CIT(A) held that the assessee is eligible for
deduction u/s 54F of the Act only in respect of 50% of the cost of
property, i.e., 50% of Rs.91,58,083/-, i.e., Rs.45,79,042/-.
16.     Aggrieved by the order passed by Ld CIT(A), both the parties
have filed appeals before the Tribunal. We have already dismissed
the appeal of the Tribunal, since the tax effect involved therein was
less than the monetary limits prescribed by CBDT for pursuing its
appeals. Hence the issues urged by the assessee are only need to
be adjudicated. Following issues are contested by the assessee:-
(a)  Whether    the  Ld  CIT(A)     was    justified  in   ignoring
expenditure of Rs.81,71,910/- incurred on the new house property
for computing deduction u/s 54F of the Act.
(b)   Whether Ld CIT(A) was justified in holding that the
assessee is entitled to claim deduction to the extent of 50% of the
cost of acquisition computed by him.
17.        From the facts discussed above, we noticed that the
agreement for the purchase of property was first entered by the
assessee’s husband in 2004.         However the sale agreement for
transfer of plot was registered only on 24.2.2007 and it was
registered in the name of the assessee and her husband.
Accordingly, the AO/Ld CIT(A) has taken the view that the assessee
was already entitled to 50% of the right in the property.             The
Hon’ble Karnataka High Court has held in the case of Mrs. Jennifer
Bhide (2011)(15 taxmann.com 82)(Kar) that the deduction u/s 54 of
the Act should not be denied merely because the name of assessee’s
husband is mentioned in the purchase document, when the entire
purchase consideration has flown from the assessee. In the instant
case also, the plot was purchased in the name of the assessee and
her husband.       Hence, what is required to be examined is the
question,      viz.,   who     has      funded       the     acquisition?.
Admittedly, in the instant case, the assessee’s husband had
advanced money initially. Subsequently, the admitted fact is that
the assessee has reimbursed the money to her husband and finally,
it is the assessee who has actually given funds for the acquisition of
the property. We notice that the Ld CIT(A) has taken the view that
the funds given by the assessee should not be taken in account and
in our view, the said view of the Ld CIT(A) is not, in our view, correct
in law.
18.    The deduction u/s 54F of the Act only induces an assessee to
make investment in residential house property. If the assessee has
herein has given money for acquisition of the property either
directly to the builder or as reimbursement to her husband, then
the assessee should be given benefit of deduction u/s 54F of the Act
for the cost of acquisition.
19.     The next impediment in the minds of the tax authorities was
that the plot was purchased jointly in the name of the assessee and
her husband and hence it should be held that both held 50% right
each and hence the assessee could have purchased only her
husband’s share only.       We are unable to agree with this logic.
There is no dispute that the assessee has actually given funds for
the acquisition of the property. When the assessee’s husband has
not given money for purchase of property, how it can be held that
her husband was owner of 50% of the property merely for the
reason that his name appears in the conveyance agreement and
also in the rental agreement. The deduction under sec.54F of the
Act shall be given only to the person who has invested the money.
In the instant case, it is the assessee who has invested the money
and hence the assessee should be given deduction u/s 54F of the
Act for the money invested by her.
20.     The next issue is with regard to the cost of acquisition. The
assessee claimed the cost of acquisition to be Rs.1,72,29,993/-.
During the remand proceedings, the assessee herself has agreed for
reduction of cost of acquisition by Rs.16,97,098/-, since she could
not prove the incurring of expenses to that extent. Hence the cost
of acquisition as per the assessee now stands at Rs.1,55,32,895/-.
There is no dispute that the assessee has invested the money to the
above said extent in acquisition of the property.
21.    The Ld CIT(A) has taken the view that the amount spent after
the date of registration of land, i.e., 24.02.2007 for interiors,
renovation, furnishing etc cannot be part of acquisition.             The
Hon’ble Karnataka High Court has held in the case of Mrs. Rahana
Siraj (2015)(58 taxmann.com 333)(Kar) that the money spent in
additions, alterations, modifications and improvements on the new
asset to make it habitable would be eligible for benefit of deduction
u/s 54F of the Act. Accordingly, we set aside the view so taken by
Ld CIT(A) as it is contradictory to the binding decision of
jurisdictional High Court. Accordingly, we hold that the assessee is
eligible for deduction u/s 54F of the Act in the amount spent on
interiors, renovation, furnishing etc.
22.       In view of the foregoing discussions, we hold that the
deduction u/s 54F of the Act should be computed on the above said
amount of Rs.1,55,32,895/- and direct the AO accordingly.
23.    In the result, the appeal filed by the assessee is treated as
allowed and the appeal of the revenue is dismissed.
Order pronounced in the open court on 28th Apr, 2022.
