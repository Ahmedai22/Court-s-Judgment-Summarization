This petition is filed by the petitioners/accused
Nos.1 to 4 under Section 482 of Cr.P.C. for quashing
the    FIR  in    Cr.No.157/2020   registered   by   the
Ramamurthy Nagar Police Station for the offences
punishable under Section 420, 506 read with Section
34 of IPC.
2.   Heard the learned counsel for the petitioners
and learned HCGP for respondent No.1-State.
Respondent No.2 served and unrepresented.
3.   The case of the prosecution is that on the
complaint of respondent No.2, the Police registered a
case on 03.05.2020 wherein, it is alleged that the
about 8 years back she came to know petitioner No.1
and both of them fell in love with each other and
petitioner No.1 agreed to marry her. Subsequently, he
left her and said to have married some other lady as
his family members supported his marriage with some
other lady. Therefore, she filed a complaint against
petitioner No.1 and his other family members for
having cheated her.
4.    Learned    counsel   for   the    petitioners
contended that mere promise of marriage and not
marrying her cannot be said to be a cheating as per the
provision of Section 415 of IPC. Absolutely there is no
ingredient for invoking the said section. After the filing
of   the  case   in  May-2020,    absolutely   there    no
investigation by the Police in spite of the petitioners
appearing before the Police after obtaining the bail and
there is no progress. Respondent No.2 has filed the
complaint only to harass the petitioners. Hence, prayed
for quashing the FIR.
5.    Per contra, learned High Court Government
Pleader objected the same.
6.    Having heard the arguments and perused
the records, admittedly respondent No.2 filed complaint
stating that accused No.1/petitioner No.1 fell in love
with   her   and  he   has   promised   to   marry   her.
Subsequently, he failed to marry her and he married
somebody else and other petitioners said to have
helped petitioner No.1 to marry some other lady. A
plain reading of the complaint would reveal that it does
not attract any ingredient of Section 415 of IPC in order
to show that the accused persons have committed the
offence under Section 420 of IPC and also she has just
stated that the accused have also threatened her in
order to attract Section 506 of IPC. Absolutely there is
no ingredient stated by her in order to show that there
is a criminal intention of cheating by petitioner    No.1
and thereby, he has promised to marry her but has
broken his promise.
7.     Learned counsel for the petitioners relied
upon a Single Bench judgment of the High Court of
Judicature at Madras, in the case of K.U.Prabhu Raj
Vs. State by Sub Inspector of Police, A.W.P.S.
Tambaram        and     another      reported     in   2012-3-
L.W.770 wherein, the Court has held at paragraphs 16
"16. A cursory perusal of the above provision
would make it clear that there are atleast three
essential ingredients constituting an offence of
cheating which should be made out from the
materials available on record. They are as follows:-
'(1) Deception of any person;
(2) Fraudulently or dishonestly inducing that
(i) To deliver any property to any person or;
(ii) To consent that any person shall retain
(3) Intentionally inducing that person to do
or omit to do anything which he would not do or
omit if he were not so deceived, and which act or
omission causes or is likely to cause damage or
harm to that person in body, mind, reputation or
17. The learned counsel for the second
respondent would further submit that the offence
involved in this case falls within the ambit of the
third limb of Section 415 I.P.C as enumerated
above. According to the learned counsel, but for
the promise made by the petitioner, the daughter
of the second respondent would have married
someone-else and settled down in her life. Thus,
according to him, the petitioner has committed a
clear   offence  of   cheating.  In my    considered
opinion, it is not so. As has been held by the
Division Bench of the Calcutta High Court in Abhoy
Pradhan v. State of W.B case (cited supra), mere
promise to marry and later on withdrawing the said
promise will not amount to an offence of cheating
at all. On such false promise to marry, the person
to whom such promise was made should have done
or omitted to do something that he would not done
or omitted to do but for the deception. In this case,
absolutely, there are no materials available on
record to show that because of the promise made
by the petitioner, the daughter of the second
respondent has done anything or omitted to do
something    which   has   the  tendency   to  cause
damage or harm to the body or mind or reputation
or   property   of  the  daughter   of  the   second
respondent. In the absence of the same, the entire
allegations found in the records, in my considered
opinion, would not make out an offence under
Section 417 or 420 I.P.C., at all."
8.    The    Hon'ble     Supreme    Court also has
categorically held in the case of S.W.PALANITKAR
reported in (2002) 1 SCC 241 at paragraph No.11
that mere breach of contract cannot give rise to any
criminal prosecution for cheating unless fraudulent or
dishonest intention is shown right at the beginning of
the transaction and the time when the offence is said to
have been committed. Here in this case, petitioner
No.1 is said to have promised to marry respondent
No.2, but failed to marry her. In view of the judgment
of the Hon'ble Supreme Court, respondent No.2 has
failed to make out a case of criminal intention of
petitioner No.1 from the beginning for cheating the
complainant. That apart, the aforesaid judgment of
High Court of judicature at Madras is applicable to the
case where the promise of marriage will not attract
Section    420   of   IPC.   This  Court   has   held  in
Crl.R.P.No.233/2020 dated 24.02.2020 in the case of
Sri.D.Ramesh Sinha Vs. State of Karnataka that as a
promise of marriage and breach of contract will not
attract the provisions of Sections 417 and 420 of IPC.
Such being the case, continuing the proceedings or
investigation against the petitioners is abuse of process
of law and therefore, the same is liable to be quashed.
Accordingly, I pass the following;
The petition is allowed.
The     investigation   against    this
petitioner in Cr.No.157/2020 registered by
the Ramamurthy Nagar Police Station is
hereby quashed.
