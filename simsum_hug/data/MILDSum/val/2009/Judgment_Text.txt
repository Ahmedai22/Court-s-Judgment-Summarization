The State of Madhya Pradesh has filed this appeal against the
order dated 20.08.2018 passed in W.P. No.5436/2017 whereby Writ
Court has directed State to consider the case of the writ petitioner for
grant of compassionate appointment on merit ignoring clause 4.1 of
the policy dated 29.09.2014.
1.     Late Ishwarsingh Rajawat working on the post of peon in the
office of collector Ujjain. He died on 12.09.2016 due to cardiac arrest
while in employment. The writ petitioner being a second son
dependent of income his father became eligible to claim a
compassionate appointment after the death of his father. He submitted
an application in prescribed form on 02.10.2016 in the Office of
Collector claiming compassionate appointment on the post of Assistant
Grade -III by virtue of his educational qualification B.Com. M.A. and
A.D.C.A. In support of the application, he has submitted the affidavit
of his mother Smt. Padma Kunwar to the effect that she has no source
of income. Her elder son Jitendra Rajawat is working in the Indian
Army since 2008 has also given an affidavit that he is not in a position
to support the family financially as he has been living separately with
his wife and not providing any financial aid to the father, mother and
writ petitioner.
2.     Vide letter dated 18.10.2016, the Collector Ujjain has sought
direction from Principal Secretary, GAD of Madhya Pradesh for grant
of compassionate appointment to the petitioner in view the condition
No.4.1 of the policy dated 29.09.2014. Vide letter dated 10.11.2016,
the Deputy Secretary of GAD of Madhya Pradesh has held that in view
of clause 4.1, the writ petitioner is not entitled to get the
compassionate appointment. Hence, the petitioner filed a writ petition,
and it came to be allowed vide order dated 20.08.2018 on the ground
that the employment in the Indian Army is a tenure appointment. The
Writ Court has held that the brother of the writ petitioner after joining
the Indian Army has been living separately and for which the writ
petitioner cannot be made to suffer.
3.     Being aggrieved by the above direction given by the writ court
the State of Madhya Pradesh has preferred this Writ Appeal on the
ground that since the elder brother of the writ petitioner is already in
employment of Indian Army, which makes the petitioner ineligible to
claim the compassionate appointment by virtue of condition No.4.1 of
the policy dated 29.09.2014. it is further submitted by the learned
Government Advocate for the appellant that the language of clause 4.1
is very clear, no other interpretation can be given. Even otherwise the
policy of compassionate appointment is only a policy framed by the
Government has no statutory force, hence, no writ of mandamus can
be issued to the State for providing employment. Shri Garg learned
Government Advocate has placed reliance on the judgment passed by
the Division Bench of Court in the case of Prajesh Vs. State of M.P. in
which clause 4.1 of the aforesaid policy has been examined and held
that the dependent of the deceased's family is not entitled to a
compassionate appointment if one of the family members is in
Government Service, even if he is not supporting the other dependent,
therefore, the order passed by Writ Court runs contrary to the aforesaid
judgment, hence, liable to be set aside.
4.     Per contra Shri A.K. Sethi, learned Senior Counsel appearing on
behalf of the writ petitioner has argued that the Hon’ble Writ Court has
rightly held that the employment in the Indian Army is different from
the service of State Government as well as Central Government. In the
Indian Army, there is no uniform age of retirement at the age of 60 or
62 years. The brother of the petitioner was initially appointed on the
post of Soldier and now he has been promoted to the post of Naik for
which retirement age is 47 years and he would be retiring from service
on 31.12.2030. In clause 4.1, if any member is in employment in
services of Corporation, Council and commission etc. then only one of
the dependents shall be ineligible to claim the compassionate
appointment. Employment in the Armed forces is liable to be excluded
as it cannot be compared with government service. Even otherwise
being an employee of the Indian Army, the brother of the writ
petitioner is posted in various parts of the country, and he is having his
own family to support. He is out from dependence of the deceased
employee; hence, no interference is warranted and writ appeal is liable
to be dismissed.
5.      The controversy involved in this appeal is in a very narrow
compass. As per the policy after the death of a Government employee,
his wife shall be entitled to the compassionate appointment and if she
is not having qualifications or is not interested in the compassionate
appointment, she can nominate her son or unmarried daughter for said
appointment. If the deceased is having a daughter only then surviving
husband or wife can nominate a married daughter also for
compassionate appointment, even the stepson and stepdaughter are
also entitled to claim a compassionate appointment. In case, a
government employee dies before marriage then his brother and
unmarried sister can also claim compassionate appointment. Clause 4
of the policy provides the disqualifications for compassionate
appointments. In the present clause, clause 4.1 applies which is
4-1 fnoaxr 'kkldh; lsod ds ifjokj dk dksbZ Hkh
lnL; ;fn iwoZ ls 'kkldh; lsok vFkok fuxe] e.My] ifj"kn

dk dksbZ lnL; fu;fer lsok esa fu;ksftr u gksus dk 'kiFk i=
The language of this clause is very clear as it says that if any
member of the family of the deceased Government employee is
already in regular service, then other dependents shall not be eligible
to claim compassionate appointments. The applicant shall submit an
affidavit that no other family member is in employment. The Division
Bench of this Court in case Prajesh Vs. State of M.P. has considered
clause 4.1 of the policy and held that a brother who is living separately
is also come under the definition of a member of the family, therefore,
merely a member of the family of the deceased servant, who is in
employment in government service or corporation or board, council or
commission has started living separately, he cannot be excluded from
the class under clause 4.1 of the policy. The Writ Court has considered
the nature of employment in the Indian Army and held that it cannot be
equated with regular services in the Government as well as Central
Government, hence, the case of the petitioner deserves to be
considered on merit ignoring clause 4.1 of the policy.
6.     Recently, this clause 4.1 of the policy again come for
consideration before Division Bench of this Court in Writ Appeal
No.13/2020 in which Division Bench of this Court has held that
merely rejecting the plea of writ petitioner on the ground that her
brother is in employment is our considered may not be correct hence,
the matter has been remitted back to conduct an enquiry with regard to
the penury of the petitioner and as to whether her brother who had
secured the employment is taking care of the family or not or other
related issues. In the said case, the Writ Court had dismissed the writ
petition placing reliance on the judgment passed in the case of Prajesh
(supra). In the case in hand also the mother has filed an affidavit to the
effect that she is not getting any financial support from his first son
because he is living elsewhere for the last 8 years with his family and
not getting any financial aid. Brother of the petitioner Jitendra Rajawat
has also given an affidavit that he is separately living along with his
wife and given his life to serving the Indian Army for this Country.
Employment in the armed force cannot be compared with service in
the state or central Government. His late father and brother used to
look after his mother, hence his younger brother is entitled to get a
compassionate appointment. By letter dated 10 November 2016
without verifying the aforesaid fact and conducting any enquiry,
respondent No.1 has communicated its decision to the Collector in
view of clause 4.1. of the policy, the writ petitioner is not entitled to
compassionate appointment.
7.     As per clause 2.1. of the policy in question only wife and
husband are treated dependent as the case may be on a government
employee and they have first right to claim the compassionate
appointment, in case wife or husband as the case may be is ineligible
then he /she can nominate son or unmarried daughter. The nomination
of a son who should be unemployed and not have any source of
income, therefore, survival either wife or husband cannot nominate son
who is already in employment. The son who is in employment is not
entitled to claim a compassionate appointment. Son means who is not
in employment. The son who is already in regular employment
constitute his own family hence he is seized to be a member of the
family of the deceased employee. In the family of a working son, his
brother has no claim. Hence, we are not inclined to interfere with the
impugned order. The order passed by the Writ Court be complied with
within a period of 60 from today.
