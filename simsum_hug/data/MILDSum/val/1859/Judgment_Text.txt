Counsel for Applicant :- Manoj Kumar Srivastava,Ajai Kumar
Counsel for Opposite Party :- G.A.
1. Heard Sri Ajai Kumar, learned counsel for applicant and Sri
K.P. Pathak, learned A.G.A. for State.
2. Applicant-Sunil, has approached this Court by way of filing
the present Criminal Misc. Bail Application under Section 439
Cr.P.C. after rejection of his Bail Application vide order dated
15.06.2021, passed by Special Judge (POCSO Act)/ Additional
Sessions Judge, Kannauj, in Case Crime No.194 of 2021, under
Section 376 I.P.C. and 5/6 POCSO Act, Police Station Kannauj,
3. The applicant is seeking bail for allegedly committing an
offence which is shocking and inhuman. It is alleged that
applicant, a Carpenter, committed offence of rape with the
victim, a minor girl of three years old. The medical examination
of the victim shows that her hymn was torn and there were
swelling over labia majora and tenderness present over
genitalia. Victim in her statement recorded under Section 164
Cr.P.C. has communicated by words and also by action that
applicant has raped her and blood was oozing out from her
private parts. The applicant was apprehended from the spot and
a named FIR was lodged against him.
4. Learned counsel for the applicant submits that applicant is a
62 years old person. There was a delay of about five days in
lodging the FIR. He was falsely implicated in the present case.
He was doing some job of Carpentry in the house of father of
victim, however there was dispute on payment of wages. The
applicant has no prior criminal antecedents and he is in jail
5. Learned A.G.A. appearing for State has opposed the bail and
drawn attention of this Court on the contents of FIR as well as
the statement of victim recorded under Section 164 Cr.P.C.
wherein she completely corroborated the prosecution case.
6(A) Law on bail is well settled that 'Bail is rule and Jail is
exception'. Bail should not be granted or rejected in a
mechanical manner as it concerns liberty of a person. At the
time of considering an application for bail, the Court must take
into account certain factors such as existence of a prima facie
case against the accused, gravity of the allegations, severity of
punishment, position and status of the accused, likelihood of the
accused fleeing from justice and repeating the offence,
reasonable apprehension of tampering with the witnesses and
obstructing the Courts as well as criminal antecedents of the
(B) It is also well settled that the Court while considering an
application for bail must not go into deep merits of the matter
such as question of credibility and reliability of prosecution
witnesses which can only be tested during the trial. Even
ground of parity is one of the above mentioned aspects which
are essentially required to be considered. It is also well settled
that the grant or refusal of bail is entirely within the discretion
of the judge hearing the matter and though that discretion is
unfettered, it must be exercised judiciously and in a humane
manner, compassionately and not in whimsical manner.
(C) The Court should record the reasons which have weighed
with the count for the exercise of its discretionary power for an
order granting or rejecting bail. Conditions for the grant of bail
ought not to be so strict as to be incapable of compliance,
thereby making the grant of bail illusory.
7. In the background of above facts and legal position of the
present case, it is prima facie evident that the applicant has
committed an inhuman act of rape on a minor girl of three
years. The victim has narrated her ordeal in words as well as in
signs and explained the entire incident of rape committed by the
applicant. Medical report shows that victim's hymen was torn
and there was swelling on her private parts. The applicant, who
has prima facie, committed a heinous crime of rape on a three
years old minor girl, is not entitled for bail.
8. The application is accordingly rejected.
