This writ petition has been filed seeking quashment of G.O. (D)
No.372, Home (Prison-IV) Department dated 22.07.2019, in and by which,
the State Level Committee's recommendation for premature release of John
David (Life Convict Prisoner No.4897), the son of the petitioner herein, has
been turned down and for a mandamus to the respondents to release John
David in terms of G.O. (Ms.) No.64 Home (Prison-IV) Department dated
01.02.2018 (for short “G.O. 64”).
2   The brief facts leading to the filing of this writ petition are as
2.1 John David faced a prosecution in S.C. No.63 of 1997 before
the Principal Sessions Court, Cuddalore (for short “the trial Court”) for the
alleged murder of one Navarasu, a I year student of MBBS course in
Annamalai University and the son of a retired Vice Chancellor of Madras
2.2 Eventually, by judgment and order dated 11.03.1998, he was
found guilty by the trial Court of the offences under Sections 364, 342, 302
and 201 IPC and was sentenced to various terms of imprisonment, the
maximum being, imprisonment for life for the offences under Sections 364
and 302 IPC.
2.3 The Madras High Court allowed his appeal in Crl.A. No.267 of
1998 on 05.10.2001 and the Supreme Court, on 20.04.2011, in
Crl.A.No.384 of 2002, reversed the acquittal order of the Madras High
Court and restored the conviction and sentence imposed on John David by
the trial Court, pursuant to which, John David is now undergoing the
sentences.
2.4 Be that as it may, to commemorate the birth centenary
celebrations of Dr. M.G. Ramachandran, the Government of Tamil Nadu
issued G.O.64, for premature release of the convict prisoners fixing several
eligibility conditions.
2.5 Since the case of John David was not considered by the
authorities for premature release by extending the benefit under G.O. 64, his
mother, the petitioner herein, filed H.C.P. No.525 of 2019 seeking premature
release of her son.
2.6 During the pendency of the said habeas corpus petition, the
State Government passed G.O.(D) No.372, Home (Prison-IV) Department
dated 22.07.2019, rejecting the recommendation of the State Level
Committee for premature release of John David, challenging which, the
present writ petition has been filed for the relief, as stated in the opening
paragraph of this order.
3   Heard Mr. A. Ramesh, learned Senior Counsel representing
Mr.G.R. Hari, learned counsel on record for the petitioner and Mr. Hasan
Mohamed          Jinnah,   learned    Public    Prosecutor,     assisted        by
Mr.R.Muniyapparaj, learned Additional Public Prosecutor appearing for the
respondents/State.
4      The State has filed a counter affidavit dated 25.08.2021 and an
additional counter affidavit dated 31.01.2022 in defence of the impugned
order. The operative portion of the impugned order reads as under:
“3.     The State Level Committee constituted in the
Government Order second read above has recommended for the
premature release of the life convict prisoner No.4897, John David,
son of David Marimuthu, confined in Central Prison-I, Puzhal.
4.      The Government have examined the State Level
Committee's recommendation for the premature release of the life
convict prisoner No.4897, John David with relevant records. The life
convict prisoner No.4897, John David, son of David Marimuthu,
confined in Central Prison-I, Puzhal was convicted by the Principal
Sessions Judge, Cuddalore on 25.04.2011 in Sessions Case No.63 of
1997 under Section 302, 342 364, 201 of IPC. As the life convict
prisoner No.4897, John David, Son of David Marimuthu by using
doctor's knife severed the head and torso of Navarasu, (junior student
of MBBS in Annamalai University, Chidambaram), son of
Dr.P.K.Ponnusamy, then Vice Chancellor of Madras University and
thrown the severed parts in various places. In this case, the above life
convict prisoner is involved in a brutal murder/heinous crime.
Considering the cruel nature of the offence committed by him, the
Government has decided to reject the State Level Committee's
recommendation for premature release of the Life Convict Prisoner
No.4897, John David, son of David Marimuthu, confined in Central
Prison-I, Puzhal and order accordingly.
Additional Chief Secretary to Government”
5      At the outset, Mr. A. Ramesh, learned Senior Counsel
appearing for the petitioner, brought to the notice of this Court, the track
record of John David and submitted that after John David was acquitted by
the High Court, he did not at all get involved in any offence and after the
judgment of the Supreme Court reversing the acquittal made by the High
Court and confirming the judgment and order of conviction and sentence
passed by the trial Court, he surrendered and his conduct in the prison
thereafter has been exemplary. He placed before this Court the details of
educational qualifications John David had acquired while in prison and also
the conduct certificate dated 29.12.2017 given by the Superintendent of
Prisons, Central Prison - I, Puzhal, which reads thus:
He is a well behaved and obedient person and he has sincerely
carried out the work allotted to him in an appreciable manner. He
was released on leave on many occasions and he has returned to
prison on time without any issues.
He has also shared his knowledge with his fellow inmates,
teaching them on English and Computer Science.
He is well reformed now and fit to be reinstated into the
society.
His conduct is good and satisfactory.”
Therefore, according to Mr. A. Ramesh, since John David has turned into a
new leaf, the State Government should have considered his case favourably
and released him under G.O. 64. In support of his contention that John
David should have been released prematurely based on his good conduct in
the prison, Mr. Ramesh placed reliance on the judgment of the Supreme
Court in Satish @ Sabbe vs. The State of Uttar Pradesh [2020 SCC
OnLine SC 811] and Home Secretary (Prison) and Others vs. H.Nilofer
6 Next, Mr. Ramesh took this Court through the impugned
Government Order and submitted that the Government had misdirected itself
by saying that “John David by using doctor's knife, severed the head and
torso of Navarasu”, which is factually incorrect, inasmuch as there is no
reference to the usage of doctor's knife in the alleged act of John David, but,
on the contrary, the findings of the trial Court shows that the knives viz.,
M.Os.9 to 11, were used for cutting fruits and they were not surgical
instruments. This according to Mr. Ramesh, shows non-application of mind
on the part of the authorities.
7  Finally, Mr. Ramesh contended that the State Government had
released the accused involved in far more heinous offences like the ones in
infamous Dharmapuri bus burning case and Melavalavu case, which is
discriminatory.
8  Per contra, Mr. Hasan Mohamed Jinnah, learned Public
Prosecutor, refuted the aforesaid contentions and submitted that the
Government had rejected the case of John David based on the manner in
which the crime was committed and not on the basis that it was committed
with a doctor's knives. He also submitted that there cannot be any negative
equality under Article 14 of the Constitution of India.
9  We initially propose to address two arguments of Mr.A.Ramesh,
viz., his reliance on Satish @ Sabbe (supra) and release of the accused in
Dharmapuri bus burning case and Melavalavu case.
10 As far as the judgment in Satish @ Sabbe (supra) is
concerned, the issue before the Supreme Court was non-application of
Section 2 of the Uttar Pradesh Prisoners Release on Probation Act, 1938, by
the executive authorities. This is limpid from paragraph 16 of the judgment
“16. It is no doubt trite law that no convict can claim
remission as a matter of right. However, in the present case, the
circumstances are different. What had been sought and directed by
this Court through repeated orders was not premature release itself,
but due application of mind and a reasoned decision by executive
authorities in terms of existing provisions regarding premature
release. Clearly, once a law has been made by the appropriate
legislature, then it is not open for executive authorities to
surreptitiously subvert its mandate. Where the authorities are found
to have failed to discharge their statutory obligations despite judicial
directions, it would then not be inappropriate for a Constitutional
Court while exercising its powers of judicial review to assume such
task onto itself and direct compliance through a writ of mandamus.”
In Tamil Nadu, we do not have similar provisions as in the State of Uttar
Pradesh and hence, this judgment may not be of much avail to John David.
In fact, in the same judgment, the Supreme Court has clearly held that no
convict prisoner can claim remission as a matter of right. Thus, the case of
John David should be decided only within the four corners of G.O. 64.
11      As regards the second argument of Mr. Ramesh, as rightly
contended by the learned Public Prosecutor, there cannot be negative
equality. At this juncture, apropos it is to allude to paragraph 28 of a very
recent judgment of the Supreme Court in R. Muthukumar and Others vs.
“28. A principle, axiomatic in this country's constitutional
lore is that there is no negative equality. In other words, if there has
been a benefit or advantage conferred on one or a set of people,
without legal basis or justification, that benefit cannot multiply, or be
relied upon as a principle of parity or equality.....”
Therefore, just because the Government had fallen in error in releasing the
accused in the infamous Dharmapuri bus burning case and Melavalavu case,
the same error cannot be allowed to be perpetrated and relief granted to John
12      Mr. A. Ramesh placed strong reliance on a Division Bench
judgment of this Court in K.Rajasekar vs. State and Others
(MANU/TN/0641/2022), in which, one of us (PNPJ), was a Member, in
support of his contention relating to equality under Article 14 of the
Constitution of India.
13      In Rajasekar (supra), the husband, Rajasekar, and his wife,
Shanthi, on account of abject poverty, smothered their three month old child
and killed her.            The Government granted remission to Rajasekar, but,
refused to grant remission to Shanthi, on the ground that the crime was a
heinous one. In that case, both of them were convicted under Section 302
read with 34 IPC, as nobody knew, who amongst the two had actually
smothered the child, as that was done in secrecy. Therefore, on those facts,
this Court held that, if according to the Government, the act of the husband
was not heinous, the Government cannot be heard to say that, the act of the
wife was heinous and deny her premature release.
14     As regards the submission of Mr. A. Ramesh that John David
has turned into a new leaf and hence, he should not be deprived of the
benefit of G.O. 64, it is true that the conduct of John David in the prison has
been exemplary, as could be seen from the conduct certificate issued by the
Superintendent of Prisons, Central Prison-I, Puzhal, extracted in
paragraph 5 (supra) and that is the reason why the State Level Committee
had recommended his premature release. However, be it noted, the State
Government and the Governor are not bound by the recommendations of the
State Level Committee, as the exercise of power for premature release of a
convict prisoner under G.O. 64 is under Article 161 of the Constitution of
India. This is manifest from paragraph 5 of G.O. 64. That apart, G.O. 64
“5(V) The above cases shall be examined with reference to
the above guidelines on a case to case basis.
(VIII) The life imprisonment        prisoners  cannot     claim
premature release as a matter of right.”
The State Level Committee which is composed of the Inspector General of
Prisons and the Deputy Inspector General of Prisons (Headquarters) can
only recommend a case to the State Government and cannot exercise the
power under Article 161 of the Constitution of India. The Governor of the
State would exercise the power under Article 161, ibid., on the
recommendation of the Cabinet. Thus, the Cabinet has the authority to
accept or reject the recommendation of the State Level Committee and
accordingly, give their advice to the Governor. In the instant case, it is
obvious that the Governor has chosen to reject the recommendation of the
State Level Committee qua premature release of John David, by the
impugned Government Order.
15     Further, in Nilofer Nisha (supra), it has been clearly held at
“26. We would also like to point out that the grant of
remission or parole is not a right vested with the prisoner. It is a
privilege available to the prisoner on fulfilling certain conditions.
This is a discretionary power which has to be exercised by the
authorities conferred with such powers under the relevant
rules/regulations. The court cannot exercise these powers though once
the powers are exercised, the Court may hold that the exercise of
powers is not in accordance with rules. .....”
In this case, the Government exercised its powers via the impugned order
and what remains to be done by this Court is to see whether the exercise of
powers by the authorities was in accordance with G.O. 64.
16    As contended by Mr. A. Ramesh, it is true that in the impugned
order, it is stated that John David had used a doctor's knife, which is
factually incorrect.          However, we find that the impugned order is not
predicated only on this erroneous fact. The other facts, viz., the head and
torso of Navarasu was severed and the severed parts were thrown in various
places and were recovered by the police, have been accepted by the trial
Court and the Supreme Court as proved facts. What had weighed with the
Government for refusing to grant the relief under G.O. 64 is the brutal and
cruel manner in which the murder of Navarasu had been committed.
17    Now, the question is, can this Court, in exercise of powers
under Article 226 of the Constitution of India, step into the shoes of the
Governor and decide about the sufficiency of the reasons given in the
impugned order. The answer to this question is available in Epuru
Sudhakar and another vs. State of Andhra Pradesh and Others [(2006)
8 SCC 161], which has been extracted in the preamble portion of G.O. 64
itself. Nonetheless, the said portion is reproduced for ready reference.
“......T he President and the Governor are the sole judges of the
sufficiency of facts and of the appropriateness of granting the pardons
and reprieves. However, this power is an enumerated power in the
Constitution and its limitations, if any, must be found in the
Constitution itself. Therefore, the principle of exclusive cognizance
would not apply when and if the decision impugned is in derogation
of a constitutional provision. This is the basic working test to be
applied while granting pardons, reprieves, remissions and
Ergo, this Court cannot examine the sufficiency of the facts for quashing the
impugned Government Order.
18      As regards the reliance placed by the learned Senior Counsel on
Nilofer Nisha (supra), the Supreme Court, in that case, proceeded to
exercise its powers under Article 142 of the Constitution of India on a case-
to-case basis and directed the release of the convict prisoners therein. We do
not have the powers of the Supreme Court to engage in such an exercise,
however sympathetic we may be towards John David. In fact, in Nilofer
Nisha (supra), which arose from this Court, this Court had ordered
premature release of convict prisoners under G.O.64, challenging which, the
State went on appeal to the Supreme Court. After discussing the legal
position, the Supreme Court, in paragraph 47, has allowed the State's
appeals, but has, under Article 142 of the Constitution of India, gone into the
case of each convict prisoner and has granted relief.
19    That apart, in Sikkander vs. State, represented by its
Secretary to Government of Tamil Nadu and Others (2021 SCC Online
Mad 6586), a Division Bench of this Court, in which, one of us (PNPJ) was
a Member, has discussed all the aspects relating to premature release of
convict prisoners under G.O.64 and the law laid down therein is a binding
precedent.
20    In view of the foregoing discussion, we find no ground
whatsoever to interfere with the impugned Government Order.
In the result, this writ petition fails and is accordingly dismissed as
being devoid of merits, however, sans costs.               Connected W.M.P. stand
closed.
