Mr.Amrut Joshi i/b Jerome Merchant & Partners for the Petitioners.
Ms.K.N. Solunke, AGP for the State – Respondent Nos.1 to 3.
Mr.G.S. Godbole with Mr.Devashish Godbole for the Respondent
Mr.Nitin V. Gangal for the Respondent Nos.21, 23, 24 and 26 to 29.
1.           By this Petition filed under Article 226 of the Constitution
of India, the Petitioners have prayed for a writ of certiorari for
quashing and setting aside the proceedings under Section 23-A of the
The Right to Fair Compensation in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation
and Resettlement Act, 2013 (for short the said “Fair Compensation
Act, 2013”) and in particular the Consent Agreements dated 9 th
March, 2022 executed by the Respondent Nos.4 to 27.
2.           The Petitioners also seek a writ of mandamus against the
Respondent Nos.4 to 29 to return the amount received by them from
the Respondent No.1 and deposit to the credit of the Special Civil Suit
No.41 of 2010 pending before the Court of Civil Judge, Senior Judge,
Palghar, subject to adjudication and final outcome of the aforesaid
3.           The Petitioners have also prayed for a writ of mandamus
against the Respondent Nos.1 and 2 to recover the amount received
from the Respondent Nos.4 to 29 as arrears of land revenue by
initiating  appropriate proceedings in accordance with law and to
credit the same to Special Civil Suit No.41 of 2010, in the event of the
Respondent Nos.4 to 32 fail and neglect to credit such amount to
Special Civil Suit No.41 of 2010. Some of the relevant facts for the
purpose of deciding this petition are as under :
4.           The Petitioner Nos.1 and 2 are the husband and wife
respectively. The Petitioner No.3 is the son of the Petitioner Nos.1
and 2. The Petitioner Nos.4 and 5 are the daughters of the Petitioner
Nos.1 and 2. The Petitioners claim to be “persons interested” under
the provisions of the said Fair Compensation Act, 2013 in respect of
the lands bearing Survey / Hissa Nos.183/1/A and 184/2/A at Village
5.           It is the case of the Petitioners that the Respondent
Nos.4 to 32 are individuals, who along with the Respondent No.1,
have illegally submitted the writ lands to acquisition under Section 23-
A of the Fair Compensation Act, 2013 behind the back of the
6.           Some time in the year 2010, the Petitioners filed Special
Civil Suit No.41 of 2010 against the Respondent Nos.4 to 29 under
Order 39, Rule 1 and 2 of the Code of Civil Procedure before the
Civil Judge,Senior Division Palghar for partition, separate possession,
cancellation of certain sale deeds and for permanent injunction
regarding the property situated in Gujarat, Gandhinagar and Dahanu.
The Petitioners also registered the lis pendense covering all the said
properties and got it registered with the Sub-Registrar, Talasari.
7.           On 17th January, 2013, the Civil Court passed an order
restraining the Respondent Nos.4 to 29 from creating third party
interest or exchanging or conveying or leasing out or mortgaging the
lands forming part of Schedule “A”, “B” and ”C” of the Plaint which
included the writ lands specifically. The Civil Court also restrained the
other Respondents in the said suit from carrying out construction in
respect of some of the lands which were the subject matter of the
aforesaid suit.
8.            On 6th February, 2014, father of the Petitioner No.1
expired. It is the case of the Petitioners that some time in the month
of March, 2022, they learnt from certain sources that the lands
bearing Survey / Hissa Nos.183/1/A and 184/2/A at Village Varvada,
Taluka Talasari, District Palghar, Maharashtra came to be acquired for
the purpose of a Bullet Train Project being undertaken by National
High Speed Rail Corporation Limited. The Petitioner No.1 obtained
the information by visiting the office of the Competent Authority on 21st
March, 2022 regarding acquisition of the writ lands.
9.            On 22nd March, 2022, this Court in an Appeal From Order
No.444 of 2013, which was filed by some of the Respondents,
confirmed the interim order passed by the Civil Court.
10.           It is the case of the Petitioners that the Petitioners
obtained certain documents by applying under the provisions of the
Right to Information Act in respect of the acquisition proceedings
pertaining to the writ lands and and states that the Respondent Nos.4
to 29 had executed the consent agreements, affidavits and other
documents, including Indemnity Bond and possession receipts on
various dates i.e. 10th March, 2022, 21st March, 2022 and 25th March,
2022 before the Competent Authority. On 25th March, 2022, the
compensation amounts in respect of the said lands were disbursed to
the Respondent Nos.4 to 29 immediately. The Petitioners filed this
Petition on 17th October, 2022.
11.          Mr.Amrut Joshi, learned counsel for the Petitioners
submitted that       disbursement of the compensation made to the
Respondent Nos.4 to 29 was in pursuance of the consent agreements
executed by them before the Competent Authority. He submitted that
those consent agreements would also clearly reflect along with
Respondent Nos. 4 to 29, the Petitioners are also the “interested
persons”. The consent of the Petitioners was however not obtained.
No notice under Section 21 of the Fair Compensation Act, 2013 was
issued/served upon the Petitioners. The entire disbursement of
compensation        by the Competent Authority in favour of the
Respondent Nos.4 to 29 is thus vitiated under Section 23-A of the Fair
12.          It is submitted by the learned Counsel for the Petitioners
that though the Collector was empowered to make an award without
making any further enquiry, such award could be made under the said
provisions only if the Collector was satisfied that all the “persons
interested” in the lands, who appeared before him, had agreed in
writing on the matters to be included in the award of the Collector in
the form prescribed by Rules made by the State Government. He
submitted that since the Petitioners being “persons interested” in the
writ lands, had not been issued any notice nor had appeared before
the Competent Authority, the Competent Authority could not have
made an award under the provisions of Section 23-A of the Fair
Compensation Act, 2013. He submitted that the purported award thus
made by the Collector,       is no award at all in the absence of the
agreements from all “the interested persons”.
13.           It is submitted by the learned Counsel for the Petitioners
that the statements made by the Respondent Nos.4 to 29 before the
Competent Authority, were totally false to their knowledge. The
Respondent Nos.4 to 29 had made a false statement that there was
no order of the Civil Court in force in respect of the lands in question.
The disbursement made by the Competent Authority in favour of the
Respondent Nos.4 to 29 is thus in complete violation of the order
dated 17th January, 2013 passed by the Civil Court.
14.           Learned counsel for the Petitioners placed reliance on
the Indemnity Bonds submitted by the Respondent Nos.4 to 29
stating that if any statement made by them is found to be false, they
shall be liable for prosecution under Sections 193 (2), 198, 199 and
200 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860. He submitted that the
Respondent Nos.4 to 29 have illegally obtained compensation behind
the back of the Petitioners and abused the process of law.
15.          It is submitted by the learned counsel for the Petitioners
that the Competent Authority could not have made an award under
Section 23-A of the Fair Compensation Act, 2013 without issuing the
notice to the Petitioners and in absence of the Petitioners being
“persons interested”. He submitted that when the statute provides for
a thing to be done in a particular manner, then, it has to be done in
that manner and in no other manner. In support of this submission, he
placed reliance on the judgment of the Hon’ble Supreme Court in
case of Nazir Ahmed vs. King Emperor and Nareshbhai
Bhagubhai & Ors. vs. Union of India & Ors. (2019) 15 SCC 1.
16.          It is submitted that the said provisions i.e. Section 23-A
of the Fair Compensation Act, 2013 being an expropriatory legislation,
which compulsorily deprives a person of his right to property without
his consent, must be construed strictly. In support of this submission,
learned counsel placed reliance on the judgment of the Hon’ble
Supreme Court in case of Nareshbhai Bhagubhai & Ors. (supra).
17.          It is submitted by the learned counsel that in the present
case, there is no other alternative efficacious remedy. He submitted
that in any event the case of the Petitioners falls under the exceptions
to the doctrine of statutory exhaustion of remedies i.e. (i) order /
proceedings are wholly without jurisdiction and (ii) principles of natural
justice have been breached in as much as no notice was given to the
Petitioners. In support of this submission, he placed reliance on the
judgment of the Supreme Court in case of Whirlpool Corporation
vs. Registrar of Trademarks, Mumbai, (1998) 8 SCC 1 and Radha
Krishna Industries vs. State of Himachal Pradesh, (2021) 6 SCC
18.           It is submitted by the learned counsel for the Petitioners
that in this case there are no disputed questions of facts as sought to
be contended by the Respondent No.1 in its affidavit. He submitted
that the Respondents have not disputed that the Petitioners are
“persons interested” since their names appeared on the purported
consent agreement itself. He submitted that even if there are disputed
questions of fact as sought to be canvassed by the Respondents,
even then, in a given case, the Writ Court has jurisdiction to entertain
a Writ Petition involving disputed questions of fact. There is no
absolute bar for entertaining a Writ Petition even if the same is arising
out of a contractual obligation and/or involves some disputed
questions of fact. In support of this submission, he placed reliance on
the judgment of the Supreme Court in case of Vinobha Bhave Nagar
Godavari Adhyapak CHSL vs. Central Railway, 2020 SC Online
19.          It is submitted by the learned counsel that       the Writ
Petition is maintainable against a private persons also, who have
benefited from the failure of a public authority. In support of this
submission, he placed reliance on the judgment of this Court in case
of Rustam Phiroze Mehta vs. State of Maharashtra, 2021 SCC
Online Bom. 1090. He submits that in this case, constitutional rights
of the Petitioners under Article 300-A have been abrogated by the
Respondents. Learned counsel for the Petitioners also tendered a
compilation of judgments in support of his submissions comprising of
ten judgments, including already referring to aforesaid.
20.          Mr.Godbole, learned counsel for the Respondent No.4 on
the other hand submitted that the award made under Section 23-A of
the Fair Compensation Act, 2013 is only an offer. He relied upon
Section 23-A of the Fair Compensation Act, 2013 and submitted that
the    Competent Authority rightly made an award under the said
provision only     in respect of “persons interested”, who appeared
before him and agreed in writing on the matters to be included in the
award. The Petitioners did not appear before the Competent Authority
under Section 23-A of the Fair Compensation Act, 2013. He invited
our attention to the consent agreement filed by the Respondent Nos.4
to 29, including his clients. He submitted that the said agreement was
only in respect of 14 H 83 R out of the total lands. He submitted that
the consent agreement was only in respect of 11 R out of the total
land acquired admeasuring 24 H 83 R and 16 H and not the entire
21.          Learned counsel invited our attention to the averments
made by the Petitioners in the plaint before the learned Civil Judge,
Senior Division, Palghar and submitted that the Petitioners had
claimed share only to the extent of 12.5% in the entire property. All
branches are of the brother of the Petitioner No.1. He submitted that
insofar as the Petitioner No.1 is concerned, his share is only to the
extent of 7.75%. Learned counsel placed reliance on the judgment of
the Hon’ble Supreme Court in case of Dr. G.H. Grant vs. The State
of Bihar, AIR 1966 SC 237 in support of his submission that it is not
the award of the Collector, which is           the source of right of
22.          It is submitted that the award is strictly speaking an offer
made to the “persons interested” in the land notified for acquisition.
The “persons interested” is entitled to accept the offer but is not
bound to accept it. He may ask for a reference to the Court for
adjudication of his claim for adequate compensation or may accept
compensation under protest. Learned counsel for the Respondent
No.4 distinguished the judgments cited by the learned counsel for
23.          Ms.Solunke, learned AGP for the State invited our
attention to the averments made in the affidavit in reply filed by the
Respondent No.1 and submitted that the Competent Authority is not
empowered to decide the question of title / ownership of land
acquired, but the same could be decided only by the Civil Court. She
submitted that after carrying out the survey and inspection of the
revenue records of the writ lands, the Collector found that the said
land had names of originally 18 persons, who have expired and their
legal heirs have come on record. After due process was followed, the
consent terms were entered into by all the parties, who were title
owners on the said land except that of the Petitioners.
24.          It is submitted that as per the information provided to the
office of the Deputy Collector, the Petitioner No.1 is the owner of the
1.85% share in the said land and is entitled to receive an amount of
Rs.3,70,904/- towards his share in the property by consent. If the
Petitioner No.1 is aggrieved by the said valuation, the Petitioner No.1
is always entitled to initiate appropriate proceedings by way of an
appeal to dispute the compensation provided qua his share /
ownership in the concerned property is proved.
25.          It is submitted that if the Petitioners are aggrieved by the
impugned order and the order of distribution of compensation amount
to the Respondent Nos.4 to 29, the Petitioners are free to initiate
appropriate proceedings before the Civil Court against private
Respondents and to seek an order of deposit of their share with the
Civil Court. It is submitted that the process of acquiring the said land
was initiated. All the interested persons were given notice. The
consent terms were filed by most of the interested persons and
accordingly the said land was acquired. The Petitioners can apply for
enhancement of the claim by filing appropriate proceedings before
the Appellate Authority or by filing appropriate proceedings against
the co-owners of the said lands.
26.          Mr.Amrut Joshi, learned counsel for the Petitioners in his
rejoinder arguments submitted that since the impugned award is
passed under Section 23-A of the Fair Compensation Act, 2013, such
award cannot be construed as an offer. He distinguished the
judgment in case of Dr. G.H. Grant (supra) cited by the learned
counsel for the Respondent No.4.
27.          It is not the case of the Petitioners that the Petitioners are
the only owners of the entire property under acquisition. The
Petitioners claimed a small portion thereof. In the Special Civil Suit
filed by the Petitioners against the Respondent Nos.4 to 29, it was
clearly admitted that the contesting Respondents were the relatives of
the Petitioners and claiming through late Sardarmal Gulabchand.
The total share in the writ property claimed by all the Petitioners was
only to the extent of 7.75%. It is the case of the Competent Authority
that the notices were given to all the parties by the Competent
Authority. However, the Petitioners did not appear before the
Competent Authority. The Respondent Nos.4 to 29 appeared and
gave their consent for acquisition of writ lands by entering into a
writing and accepted the agreed compensation. The share of the
Petitioner No.1 is 1.55% and the compensation is accordingly derived
at Rs. 3,11,560/-. The share of the Petitioner Nos.2, 3, 4 and 5 also
is at 1.55% each.
28.           A perusal of Section 23-A(1) of the Fair Compensation
Act, 2013 reads thus :
"23- A. Award of Collector without enquiry in
case of agreement of interested persons
(1) Notwithstanding anything contained in section
23, if at any stage of the proceedings, the Collector is
satisfied that all the persons interested in the land
who appeared before him have agreed in writing on
the matters to be included in the award of the
Collector in the form prescribed by rules made by the
State Government, he may, without      making further
enquiry, make an award according to the terms of
such agreement.”
29.          A perusal of Section 23-A (1) of the Fair Compensation
Act, 2013 indicates that the Collector is empowered to make an
award in accordance with the terms of the agreement with all persons
interested in the land, who appeared before him and agreed in writing
on the matters to be included in the award in the form prescribed by
rules made by the State Government. The Petitioners admittedly did
not appear before the Competent Authority and did not enter into any
agreement in writing by including their terms in the award.
30.          We are not inclined to accept the submission made by
Mr.Joshi, learned counsel for the Petitioners that even if one or more
persons interested claiming certain share in the property under
acquisition are absent, no award can be made under Section 23-A of
the Fair Compensation Act, 2013 in favour of other persons interested
having certain share in the property under acquisition to the extent of
their share. The said award under Section 23-A of the Fair
Compensation Act, 2013 made by the Competent Authority
quantifying    the compensation for the Petitioners is not final and
binding on the Petitioners. The said award was made after making
enquiry   as    contemplated   under     Section   23-A  of  the   Fair
Compensation Act, 2013. The Petitioners have a remedy to apply for
enhancement of the said claims         under Section 64 of the Fair
Compensation Act, 2013. The Civil Suit filed by the Petitioners inter-
alia praying for partition, separate possession and injunction in
respect of various properties situated at different places is
pending.The lis pendens executed on behalf of the Petitioners is
already registered in the Sub-Registrar, Talasari.
31.           Insofar as injunction order passed by the Civil Court
below Exhibit 5 in Special Civil Suit No.41 of 2010 on 17 th January,
2013 is concerned, by the said order, the Defendant Nos.1 to 32 in
the said suit or anybody claiming on their behalf were temporarily
restrained from creating third party rights, title and interest or
exchange or convey or lease out or mortgage the said properties to
any third persons. If according to the Petitioners, the Respondent
Nos.4 to 29 could not have transferred their share to the acquiring
body in the teeth of an injunction order passed by the Civil Suit, the
Petitioners     can   adopt    appropriate   proceedings    against    the
Respondent Nos.4 to 29 before the Civil Court. The award made
under Section 23-A of the Fair Compensation Act, 2013 by the
Competent Authority cannot be set aside by this Court in this Writ
Petition in view of there being the disputed questions of fact and the
issue of title of the Petitioners being sub-judice before the Civil Court .
The question as to whether the Petitioners have any rights over the
writ property or not is pending before the Civil Court.
32.           In so far as the judgment       of this Court   in case of
Pandurang vs. State of Maharashtra & Ors. (supra), relied upon
by the learned counsel for the petitioners, it is held by this Court that
an award made by the Collector under Section 11 of the Act is an
offer of price.    A person is entitled to accept     the compensation
offered under protest and then apply for making of a reference to
the District Court for determination of the compensation. When a
person enters into an agreement under Section 11(2), the award
cannot be regarded as an offer which may or may not be accepted
by the person whose land is acquired because he has entered into
an agreement regarding the amount of compensation. In our view,
the said judgment would not advance the case of the petitioners.
The respondent nos.4 to 27 have admittedly given their consent and
have accepted       amount of compensation. If the petitioners        are
aggrieved by the quantification of compensation, the remedy of the
petitioners is to apply for enhancement under Section 64 of the Fair
Compensation Act, 2013. The said judgment in case of Pandurang
vs. State of Maharashtra & Ors. (supra) is clearly distinguishable
on facts.
33.           In so far as the judgment of the Supreme Court in case of
Nareshbhai Bhagubhai & Ors. vs. Union of India & Ors. (supra)
with other connected matters relied upon by the learned counsel for
the petitioners in support of the submission that where a statute
provides for a thing to be done in a particular manner, then it has to
be done in that manner and in no other manner is concerned, there is
no dispute about this proposition of law. In our view, since under
Section 23A of the Fair Compensation Act, 2013, the competent
authority is empowered         to make an award        if all the persons
interested to appear before the competent authority and agreed for
acquisition   of    their   respective   shares     and    accepted   the
compensation, the competent authority is empowered to make an
award     under the said provision.      No steps     are taken    by the
competent authority contrary to the mode and manner of making an
award prescribed under Section 23A. The said judgment of the
Supreme Court in case of Nareshbhai Bhagubhai & Ors. vs. Union
of India & Ors. (supra) thus would not advance the case of the
petitioner and is clearly distinguishable on facts.
34.          In so far as the judgment of the Supreme Court in case of
Whirlpool Corporation vs. Registrar of Trade Marks, Mumbai &
Ors. (supra) relied upon by the learned counsel for the petitioners is
concerned, Supreme Court in the said judgment has held that the
Court has discretion to entertain or not to entertain the petition under
Article 226 of the Constitution of India. It is held that where the Writ
Petition has been filed for the enforcement of any of the Fundamental
rights or where there has been a violation of the principle of natural
justice or where the order or proceedings are wholly without
jurisdiction or the vires of an Act is challenged, an alternate remedy
would not operate as an absolute bar in these circumstances.       The
petitioners in this case have not demonstrated as to how their case
falls under the exceptions carved out. The said judgment of the
Supreme Court in the case of Whirlpool Corporation vs. Registrar
of Trade Marks, Mumbai & Ors. (supra) would not apply to the facts
of the case of the petitioners.
35.           Insofar as the judgment of the Supreme Court in case of
Radha Krishan Industries vs. State of Himachal Pradesh & Ors.
(supra) relied upon by the petitioners is concerned, the Supreme
Court has taken a similar view that was taken in case of Whirlpool
Corporation      vs. Registrar    of Trade Marks, Mumbai        & Ors.
(supra). For the reasons recorded by this Court while dealing with the
judgment of the Supreme Court in case of Whirlpool Corporation
vs. Registrar      of Trade Marks, Mumbai         & Ors. (supra), this
judgment would also not apply to the case of the petitioners.
36.           In so far as the judgment of this Court in case of
Society Ltd. vs. Central Railway (supra) relied upon by the learned
counsel for the petitioners is concerned,       this Court in the said
judgment recorded a finding that there were no disputed questions of
fact in the petition and accordingly held that the writ petition was
maintainable. In this case,       the suit filed by the petitioners for
adjudication of their rights, title and interest in respect of the writ
property is still pending. Thus the said judgment of this Court in case
Housing Society Ltd. vs. Central Railway (supra) does not assist
the case of the petitioners.
37.          In so far as the judgment of this Court in case of Rustam
Phiroze Mehta vs. State of Maharashtra & Ors. (supra) relied upon
by the learned counsel for the petitioners is concerned, in prayer
clause (c) of this petition, the petitioners have prayed for mandatory
injunction against private parties to deposit, the amount received by
them from the competent authority. A civil suit filed by the petitioners
against these respondents is pending. The said Judgment would not
apply to the facts of this case.
38.          In so far as the judgment in case of Nazir Ahmad vs.
The King-Emperor (supra) relied upon by the learned counsel for
the petitioners is concerned, the said judgment would not even apply
remotely to the facts of this case. In the said judgment, the Court has
dealt with the confession recorded by the Magistrate.
39.          In so far as the judgment of the Supreme Court in the
case of State of Karnataka & Anr. vs. Sangappa Dyavappa
Biradar & Ors. (supra) is concerned, the Supreme Court has held
that where the consent award was passed by the LAO with an
undertaking from the respondent landowners that they would not seek
enhancement of compensation so awarded from any Court, the
High Court could not have substituted the award passed by the
LAO.    In our view, the judgment of the Supreme Court in case of
State of Karnataka & Anr. vs. Sangappa Dyavappa Biradar & Ors.
(supra) would not apply to the facts of this case even remotely.
40.          In so far as the judgment of the Supreme Court in case
of State of Gujarat & Ors. vs. Daya Shamji Bhai & Ors. (supra)
relied upon by the learned counsel for the petitioners is concerned,
Supreme Court in the said judgment held that the claimants had
agreed to receive compensation and 25 per cent more in addition
thereto and agreed not to seek any reference under Section 18. They
had also agreed to forgo their right to seek reference under Section
18 of the Act. In view of the specific contract made by the
respondents in terms of Section 11(2), they were not held entitled to
seek a reference from civil Court. In our view, this judgment would
not advance the case of the petitioners. It is not the case of the
respondents that the petitioners not having appeared before the
competent authority and not having             agreed to accept the
compensation     by   consent    cannot    be  allowed   to  apply for
enhancement       of claim      under Section 64 of the said Fair
Compensation Act, 2013. The judgment of the Supreme Court in
case of State of Gujarat & Ors. vs. Daya Shamji Bhai & Ors.
(supra) thus would not apply to the facts of this case and is clearly
distinguishable on facts.
41.          In so far as the judgment of the Supreme Court in case
of Dr.G.H. Grant vs. The State of Bihar (supra) relied upon by
Mr.Godbole, learned counsel for the respondent No.4 is concerned, it
is held that an award by the Collector is strictly speaking an offer
made to the person interested in the land notified for acquisition. The
latter may accept the offer, but is not bound to accept it. He may ask
for a reference to the Court for adjudication of his claim for adequate
compensation. The person interested may even accept the
compensation under protest as to the sufficiency of the amount and
ask for a reference. It is the case of the respondents that the
petitioners had given their consent       for making an award under
Section 23A of the Fair Compensation Act, 2013, and based on such
consent, the impugned award has been made by the competent
authority under Section 23A of the Fair Compensation Act, 2013.
The right of the petitioners under the provisions of the Fair
Compensation Act, 2013 are not taken away by virtue of the said
impugned award made by the competent authority under Section 23A
of the Fair Compensation Act, 2013 in so far as the alleged claim of
the petitioners in the writ property is concerned. In our view, the writ
petition is totally devoid of merit.
42.            We accordingly pass the following order :-
(i).           The Writ petition is dismissed. No order as to costs.
