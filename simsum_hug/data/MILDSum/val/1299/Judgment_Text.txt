                    1     We have heard the learned Advocate for the Petitioner and the
                    learned Advocate for the Respondent No.2.
                    2     The Petitioner seeks directions against the Respondents to mention
                    in their each show cause notice/summon/order about the right of legal
                    representation available to the noticees, if they want to avail the legal aid.
                    So also seeks directions against the Respondents to appoint and maintain
                    a panel/list of lawyers, whose services can be availed for such legal aid.
                    3     The Affidavit is filed by Respondent No.2 to the effect that the SEBI
                    and IPEF Regulations and Guidelines in respect of legal aid for legal
                    proceedings are in force since the year 2009 and whenever the need arises
                    the legal aid is provided.
4      Before filing the present PIL, the Petitioner has not approached
Maharashtra State Legal Services Authority and/or the responsible Authority
and has straightway filed the present PIL.
5      The PIL cannot be entertained unless the Authorities concerned have
denied to entertain the cause of the Petitioner.
6      On record we do not find that a particular person had approached
Respondent No.2 for legal aid and was denied. In absence of specific
pleadings in that regard, it would not be appropriate to pass orders in the
7      In case, in future, the Petitioner approaches the Authorities/Bodies
concerned and his grievance is not redressed then the Petitioner may
agitate about the rights.
8      The PIL is disposed of. No costs.
