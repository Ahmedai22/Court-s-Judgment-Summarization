[2]                 The facts taken from the writ petition are as under:
27 years old Jamal Hossain alias Kala who was serving as a
Cleaner in Dubai came home in the month of September, 2021 to enjoy his
vacation with his family consisting of his mother, wife and children. He was
scheduled to return to Dubai on 22.09.2021 for which he already bought a
return ticket from Indigo Airlines. On14.09.2021 at about 11.30 pm a police
team consisting of 6/7 police personal led by Sri Tapan Debnath entered into
the house of the petitioners and enquired as to whether Jamal Hossain was at
home. As soon as Jamal came out of his room, the police team caught hold
of him and started beating him. Before leaving along with Jamal Hossain,
one of the members of the police team remarked that everybody would see
the dead body of Jamal Hossain on the following day. On 15.09.2021 at
about7.30 am Md. Aktar Hossain and Mst. Ajufa Khatun came to the police
station to see their brother. Police did not allow them to meet their brother.
At around 9.30 a.m. they were informed that their brother Jamal Hossain
died in the lockup. Petitioners alleged that when the police team was
assaulting Jamal Hossain at the time of his arrest, his wife and mother
begged of them to refrain from beating him. But they did not pay heed to
their request. It has been alleged that as a result of their torture, Jamal
Hossain who was completely fit before his arrest, died in police lockup
within few hours of his arrest. Wife of the deceased lodged a written FIR
with the Officer-in-charge of Sonamura P.S which was registered as
Sonamura P.S. Case No.2021 SNM 092 under Section 304 read with Section
34 IPC. According to petitioners, Jamal Hossain died due to severe custodial
torture by police for which           they claimed compensation of a sum of
Rs.50,00,000/-(rupees fifty lakhs) and appropriate action against the
persons who were responsible for the death of Jamal Hossain.
[3]                 The State respondents filed counter affidavit on 17.12.2021
along with the enclosures. In the counter affidavit, it has been asserted that a
police team led by Tapan Debnath, Asstt. Sub-Inspector of Police of
Sonamura police station went to the house of Jamal Hossain during the
intervening night between 14.09.2021 and 15.09.2021 at about 11.56 pm to
arrest Jamal Hossain in execution of arrest warrant which was issued against
him in Special NDPS Case No.18/2016 under Section 22(c) of the NDPS
Act pending before the Special Judge, Court No.3 at Agartala and another
arrest warrant which was issued in Case No.PRC(W)(D) 392 of 2009 under
Section 392 IPC pending in the Court of SDJM, Bishalgarh. Feeling the
presence of police at his home, Jamal Hossain tried to escape through the
rough terrain in the backyard of his house. While running away, he fell and
he was caught by the police team. It has been asserted in the counter
affidavit that immediately after arrest he was taken to Sonamura Community
Health Centre for medical examination. The accused did not complain of
any illness at that time. The doctors who examined him also found him fit.
Accordingly, he was brought to the police station and kept in the police
lockup in Sonamura police station. At around 02:04 hours Jamal complained
of chest pain. He was again taken to Sonamura Community Health Centre
where he was examined by Dr. Prabal Das. The deceased was advised ECG
for which he was taken to Melaghar Sub-Divisional Hospital. The attending
doctor at Melaghar Sub-Divisional Hospital examined him and after
prescribing some medicines, he released Jamal Hossain from hospital. He
was then brought back to the lockup of Sonamura Police Station at around
0416 hours. Subsequently at around 7.30 pm on 15.09.2021 when the Sentry
called him to wake him up, he did not respond. The Medical Officer was
called who declared him dead. Immediately thereafter a Suo Motu UD case
was registered at the police station vide Sonamura P.S UD Case No.15 of
2021 under Section 174 Cr. P. C to ascertain the actual cause of death. The
post-mortem of the deceased was conducted and the doctors opined that he
died of “acute coronary artery disease”. It has been asserted by the State
respondents that the CC TV footage of the police lockup in which the
deceased was kept at the material time would reveal that no torture was
committed to the deceased. According to the State respondents, he suffered
some simple injuries while he was trying to evade police arrest and he was
never assaulted by any member of the police team.
[4]                 After the incident had happened, the District Magistrate and
Collector, Sepahijala District under Order No.F.2(47)/DM/SPJ/JDL/2020
/8734-37 dated 15.09.2021 appointed the Addl. District Magistrate and
Collector of his district to conduct a magisterial enquiry to ascertain the real
cause of death of Jamal Hossain alias Kala and submit a detailed report for
taking next course of action.
[5]                 Pursuant to the order of the District Magistrate and Collector,
the ADM of the district has conducted enquiry and submitted his report
dated 11.01.2022 which has been placed before us in sealed cover.
[6]                 It would appear from the report that the Inquiry Officer has
recorded the statements of the material witnesses including the doctors who
examined Jamal Hossain before his death, the doctors who conducted the
post-mortem examination, Ranjit Debnath, who was in the same lockup at
Sonamura police station with the deceased at the material time, the police
officer who arrested Jamal Hossain from his home and the family members
of Jamal Hossain including his wife and mother. After enquiry, the Addl.
District Magistrate and Collector has drawn the following conclusion in his
In view of the above findings and observation, prima
facie, it appears that the deceased Jamal Hossain alias
Kala, S/o Ali Ashwab of Balerdhepa, P.S Sonamura,
Sepahijala district, Age about 33 years, had been found
dead inside the lockup of Sonamura P.S on 15.09.2021 at
about 7 am, after being retained in the custody since night
of 14.09.2021. He was arrested by the Police from
Sonamura P.S at the night of 14.09.2021 as per Warrant
issued against Special NDPS Act, 18/2016 which was issued
by Judge Special Court NDPS Act 1985 (Court No. 3) West
Tripura, Agartala and another Case No.PRC(WP)-392/09
issued by SDJM. Bishalgarh. Before taking into custody a
medical check-up was conducted on him at Sonamura CHC
from where he was found normal. Afterwards he was taken
to the lockup where he complained that he was having pain
at his chest. Again he was taken to Sonamura CHE where
he was treated primarily, but there was no improvement in
his condition. Accordingly, he was referred to the Sub-
Divisional Hospital at Melaghar where he had no
complaint. The doctor-on-duty advised to get an ECG done
next morning, as no facility was there in the Sub-Divisional
Hospital as well as in private at night. Subsequently he was
taken back to the lockup at Sonamure PS. Rest of the night
he was detained in the lockup along with another person
namely, Ranjit Debnath who was also detained for different
reason. No complaint had been received by the officials on-
duly since after Jamal Hossain was detained in the lockup.
In the morning Jamal Hossain was found dead inside the
lockup which was under lock and key. Necessary
formalities like inquest, post mortem had been done after
the said person was found dead. As per post mortem report,
some external injuries of ante mortem in nature had been
found on the body of the deceased which was suspected to
be caused by impact of some hard, blunt, elongated and
cylindrical object. Age of this injury was fresh (within 24
hours of infliction) at the time of death. On completion of
the said post mortem examination, the team of the Doctors,
who conducted the post-mortem opined that cause of death
was acute coronary artery disease. On careful examination
of all the relevant reports as well as deposition of the
witnesses, CCTV footage as well as circumstantial
evidences, it is opined that the cause of death of Jamal
Hossain alias Kala was natural which was due to acute
coronary artery disease.”
[7]                 Heard Mr. P. Roy Barman, learned Sr. Advocate who is
appearing for the petitioners along with Mr. Samarjit Bhattacharjee and Mr.
Kwasik Nath, Advocates. Also heard Mr. S. S. Dey, learned Advocate
General appearing along with Mr. Ratan Datta, learned Public Prosecutor for
the State respondents.
[8]                 It is contended by Mr. Roy Barman, learned senior advocate
that Jamal Hossain             who was completely fit before his arrest died within
few hours of his arrest in the police lockup which has made it clear that
Jamal Hossain died in the police lockup due to custodial torture. Counsel
contends that the deceased was pursuing his occupation as a Cleaner in
Dubai for the last few years. He had a valid Indian passport and only in the
month of February, 2021 a hospital named ‘Life Hope Hospital L.L.C’ of
Dubai issued a certificate of fitness in favour of the deceased (Annexure-1).
Counsel also contended that deceased also bought a ticket from Indigo
airlines for returning to Dubai and he was scheduled to return to Dubai by
Indigo Flight No.6E-961 on 22.09.2021 (Annexure-2). Counsel has
contended that the deceased was a 27 years’ old young man who was
pursuing his occupation in Dubai for maintaining his family in India. It was
unlikely that he would suddenly die in the police lockup unless he was
tortured in the custody. Counsel contends that during post mortem
examination, several ante-mortem external injuries in the body of the
deceased were discovered. State respondents could not offer any plausible
explanation as to how the deceased received those injuries. It has been
argued that the said injuries prove custodial violence on the deceased.
Counsel therefore, urges the Court to grant adequate compensation to the
writ petitioners and issue direction for appropriate action against the persons
who are responsible for the death of Jamal Hossain.
[9]                 Mr. S. S. Dey, learned Advocate General appearing for the
State on the other hand vehemently opposes the petition and argues that
deceased left the country for Dubai only to evade police arrest from the
cases pending against him. Learned Advocate General has contended that
pursuant to a secret information to the effect that accused returned home, the
police team conducted a raid in his house to execute those arrest warrants.
Jamal Hossain received the external injuries when he tried to escape for
which the police officers cannot be held responsible in any manner. Counsel
argued that for formal medical check up he was produced at the nearest
hospital immediately after his arrest and the doctors after careful
examination found him completely fit. In the night when he complained of
chest pain he was again brought back to Sonamura Community Health
Centre from where he was taken to Melaghar Hospital.               The attending
doctors prescribed some medicines and released him from hospital. Only
thereafter he was brought back to Sonamura Police Station and even the
medicines prescribed by doctors were administered to him. Thereafter in the
police lockup he died of “acute coronary artery disease” for which no
police officer was responsible. Learned Advocate General also argued that
CC TV footage of the police lockup would also reveal that there was no
assault on him in the police lockup. Learned counsel further contended that
the State respondents suo motu appointed an officer of the rank of Addl.
District Magistrate and Collector of the concerned district to conduct an
inquiry into the matter, whose report would indicate that the allegation of
custodial torture was not at all true. Since there is no proof of custodial
violence learned Advocate General, urges the Court to dismiss the petition.
[10]                In her FIR lodged immediately after the death of her husband
in police lockup, Smt. Rasheda Khatun, wife of the deceased categorically
stated that while dragging her husband to the police vehicle after his arrest
from home on 14.09.2021, he was severely beaten by police. She even
caught hold of the feet of the police officials and begged of them to refrain
from beating her husband. Even in the morning of 15.09.2021 she was never
allowed to meet her husband till she was informed at around 9.30 am that
her husband died in the police lockup. Her statement has also been recorded
by the Addl. District Magistrate and Collector on 09.12.2021 in the course
of the magisterial enquiry where she supported her FIR statement. In her
statement before the Addl. District Magistrate and Collector, wife of the
deceased stated that her husband was completely fit before he was arrested
by police. She also stated that her husband was beaten by police on his chest
and back. Smt. Peyara Khatun, mother of the deceased also made similar
statement to the Addl. District Magistrate and Collector. She stated that
police was striking her son with the butt of the rifle on his chest. When he
fell on earth he was hit with the butt of the rifle on his back. Then he was
dragged to the police vehicle. She heard one of the members of the police
team saying that her son would die.
[11]                Dr. Prabal Ghosh of Sonamura Community Health Centre who
examined the deceased twice in his health centre stated during the
magisterial enquiry that he found no external injury in the body of the
deceased. Similarly, Dr. Mahaboor Rahman of Melagarh Hospital who
examined the deceased between 1.00 am and 2.00 am on 14.09.2021 also
stated during the magisterial enquiry that he did not find any injury mark.
Surprisingly, the team of doctors who conducted the post mortem
examination of the deceased recorded in the post mortem examination report
that there were ante mortem external injuries on the body of deceased Jamal
Hossain. They confirmed it in their statement recorded during the
magisterial enquiry. It would be appropriate to reproduce the following
extract from the statement of Dr. Sutirtha Dasgupta who was one of the
While conducting the said post-mortem
examination, we found that Rigor mortis was present all
over the body. P.M Lividity was on back of trunk and
fixed. Mouth and both eyes were partially closed. Face
and eyes were congested. Tongue was inside the oral
cavity and intact. There was an old healed depigmented
irregular shaped scar mark of 1.5 cm x 1 cm dimension,
present over the back of right elbow joint. Another old
healed hyperpigmented irregular shaped scar mark of
4cm x 2cm dimension was present over uppermost part of
deltoid region of right arm. Mouth and both eyes were
partially closed. Face and eyes were congested. Tongue
was inside the oral cavity and intact.
The following external injuries were also found on
1)      A tramline bruise was obliquely present over right
side of upper part of back of trunk, dimension:9 cm x 1
cm. The upper lateral end of this injury was situated just
below the shoulder top and the lower medial end was
situated 10 cm from midline. The pale area of this
tramline bruise was 0.6 cm.
2)      A tramline bruise was obliquely present over back
and outer aspect of left arm, dimension: 15 cm x 1 cm.
The upper lateral end of this injury was situated 5 cm
below the shoulder top and the lower medial end was
situated 2 cm left from midline over the back of left elbow
joint. The pale area of this tramline bruise was o.6 cm.
Above mentioned injuries were ante mortem in
nature and caused by impact of some hard, blunt,
elongated and cylindrical object. Age of this injury was
fresh (within 24 hours of infliction) at the time of death.”
[12]                The State respondents in their counter affidavit tried to defend
the case by saying that the deceased received the injuries when he tried to
escape through the rough terrain of the backyard of his house to evade
police arrest. This is not acceptable to us because the plea of the State
respondents that deceased received the external injuries by falling on rough
terrain in the backyard of his house while he was trying to evade police
arrest does not derive support from the observation made in the magisterial
enquiry report. Under paragraph-11 at page-22 of his report the Addl.
District Magistrate and Collector has observed as under:
“c.     There may be some physical tussle at the time of
arrest which may be the cause of external injury, as
reflected in the Post mortem report.”
[13]                Suspicion also arises from the statement of Ranjit Debnath
who was in the same lockup with deceased Jamal Hossain on 14.09.2021 as
an accused in another case. He stated during magisterial enquiry that at
around 1.30 pm when Jamal was brought to the police lockup, he was crying
in pain loudly. Hearing the cries of Jamal Hossain, Ranjit woke up from
sleep. Jamal was then pushed into the lockup. He continued crying over a
quite long period of time.                He was complaining of severe chest pain.
However, Ranjit had gone into sleep. In the morning he woke up when he
heard one Sentry guard calling him. Being asked by the guard, he also called
Jamal to wake up. But, Jamal did not respond to his call. Thereafter, the
police officers entered into the lockup. After a while he came to know that
Jamal Hossain died.
[14]                From the facts and circumstances stated herein above, the
allegation of custodial torture on the deceased cannot be ruled out. The
mother as well as the wife of the deceased were present when deceased
Jamal Hossain was arrested. Mother of the deceased had categorically stated
during the magisterial enquiry that police gave a hard blow on the chest of
his son by the butt of the rifle and when he fell on the ground another blow
was given on his back. Wife of the deceased also stated during the
magisterial enquiry that her husband was being beaten constantly until he
was lifted in the police vehicle. She even caught hold of the feet of some of
the police staff and requested them to refrain from beating her husband.
Ranjit Debnath who was in the police lockup with the deceased also stated
that deceased was crying in severe chest pain in the lockup before he died.
Surprisingly, the doctors who examined the deceased in Sonamura
Community Health Centre as well as in Melaghar Hospital did not find any
external injury in the body of the deceased whereas in the post-mortem
report it has been clearly indicated that there were external injuries in the
body of the deceased which were ante mortem and fresh in age.
[15]                In the counter affidavit the state respondents have pleaded that
the injuries were caused to the deceased due to his falling on the rough
terrain while he was trying to evade police arrest by running away through
the backyard of his house whereas in the magisterial enquiry report in
paragraph-11 it has been stated that ‘some physical tussle at the time of
arrest which may be the cause of external injury, as reflected in the Post
mortem report’.
[16]                In these highly suspicious facts and circumstances of the case
custodial violence on the deceased, as alleged, cannot be brushed aside.
Having said so, we are of the view that it would not be inappropriate to
award a reasonable amount of monetary compensation to the petitioners for
the death of Jamal Hossain in police lockup.
[17]                For determination of the quantum of compensation we may
profitably refer to the decision of the Apex Court in the case of D.K. Basu
Vrs. State of W.B: reported in (1997) 1 SCC 416 wherein the Apex Court
has held that the objective of such monetary compensation is to apply balm
to the wounds and not to punish the transgressor or the offender, as
awarding appropriate punishment for the offence must be left to the criminal
courts in which the offender is prosecuted. Observation made by the
Hon’ble Apex Court in paragraph-54 of the judgment is as under:
“54. Thus, to sum up, it is now a well accepted
proposition in most of the jurisdictions, that monetary or
pecuniary compensation is an appropriate and indeed an
effective and sometimes perhaps the only suitable remedy
for redressal of the established infringement of the
fundamental right to life of a citizen by the public
servants and the State is vicariously liable for their acts.
The claim of the citizen is based on the principle of strict
liability to which the defence of sovereign immunity is not
available and the citizen must receive the amount of
compensation from the State, which shall have the right
to be indemnified by the wrongdoer. In the assessment of
compensation, the emphasis has to be on the
compensatory and not on punitive element. The objective
is to apply balm to the wounds and not to punish the
transgressor or the offender, as awarding appropriate
punishment for the offence (irrespective of compensation)
must be left to the criminal courts in which the offender is
prosecuted, which the State, in law, is duty bound to do.
That award of compensation in the public law
jurisdiction is also without prejudice to any other action
like civil suit for damages which is lawfully available to
the victim or the heirs of the deceased victim with respect
to the same matter for the tortious act committed by the
functionaries of the State. The quantum of compensation
will, of course, depend upon the peculiar facts of each
case and no strait-jacket formula can be evolved in that
behalf. The relief to redress the wrong for the established
invasion of the fundamental rights of the citizen, under
the public law jurisdiction is, thus, in addition to the
traditional remedies and not in derogation of them. The
amount of compensation as awarded by the Court and
paid by the State to redress the wrong done, may in a
given case, be adjusted against any amount which may be
awarded to the claimant by way of damages in a civil
suit.”
[18]                In view of the facts and circumstances of the case and the law
laid down by the Apex Court in the Judgment cited to (supra) we direct the
state respondents to pay a sum of Rs.10,00,000/-(rupees ten lakhs) as
compensation to the petitioners for the custodial death of Jamal Hossain by
depositing the said amount with the Registry of this Court within a period of
four weeks from today. The petitioners who are the widow, children and
mother of the deceased shall be entitled to equal share of the said amount of
compensation. On deposit of the compensation, Registry shall disburse the
share of the mother and wife of the deceased by transferring the same to
their individual bank account. The share of the children shall be invested in
term deposits in their names in any nationalised bank until they attain
majority and the monthly interest generated from those deposits shall be
transferred to the account of their mother for their educational and other
[19]                We make it clear that the observations made herein shall not
have any bearing on any prosecution, if any, in connection with the alleged
[20]                In terms of the above, the petition stands allowed and disposed
of. Pending application(s), if any, shall also stand disposed of.
