Heard Mr. Bhavin Suchak, the learned counsel for the
applicant, Mr. A.S. Dhore, the learned counsel for                               non-
applicant 1 and Mr. N.S. Rao, the learned APP for                                non-
applicant 2.
2.               The   applicant is  assailing    the    order      dated
24.10.2017, rendered by the Judicial Magistrate First Class,
Chikhli in Miscellaneous Criminal Case 299/2017, of issuance
of process for offences punishable under sections 504 and 506
of Indian Penal Code (“IPC” for short) and the judgment dated
25.2.2021, rendered by the Sessions Judge, Buldana, whereby
Criminal Revision 97/2017, preferred by the applicant
challenging the order of issuance of process, is dismissed.
3.               The applicant shall be hereinafter referred to as
the accused and the non-applicant 1 herein shall be referred to
as the complainant. The complainant preferred Miscellaneous
Criminal Case 299/2017 alleging commission of offence
punishable under sections 504 and 506 of IPC.                          The
complainant alleged that he is the owner and in possession of
land assigned survey 190/1, situated at Chikhli Division – 2,
Taluka Chikhli, District Buldana and the accused, who is rich
and politically well connected, is persistently harassing and
threatening the complainant to coerce him to give the said land
to the accused.
4.               The complainant alleges that at 11.00 a.m. on
17.8.2017, while the complainant was present at his house
situated on the said land, the accused accompanied by two or
three unknown persons, threatened the complainant that he
would be murdered if the said land is not given to the accused.
The complainant avers that he is a senior citizen residing alone
in the house constructed on the said land and he requested
accused not to issue such threats. However, the accused was in
no mood to see reason and abused the complainant in obscene
language. It is alleged that due to the accused’s influence and
connections, nobody musters courage to confront him. It is
further alleged that while the accused was threatening the
complainant of harm, several persons gathered, however, due
to fear, nobody interfered.       The complainant reported the
incident at the Chikhli Police Station and report was treated as
non-cognizable.
5.               The learned Magistrate recorded the statement of
the complainant which reiterates the allegations in the
complaint. The learned Magistrate then directed issuance of
process for offences punishable under sections 504 and 506 of
IPC recording that on perusal of the complaint, the verification
statement and the relevant record, sufficient ground for
proceeding against the accused are revealed.             The accused
preferred Criminal Revision 97/2017 inter alia contending that
there is nothing in the complaint and in the verification
statement as would disclose commission of offence punishable
under sections 504 and 506 of IPC.
6.               The learned Sessions Judge dismissed the Revision
on the premise that prima facie commission of offence is
disclosed from the complaint and the verification statement.
7.               The learned counsel for the accused Mr. Bhavin
Suchak reiterates the submission which did not find favour
with the learned Sessions Judge. Mr. Bhavin Suchak submits
that the learned Magistrate did not conduct any inquiry nor did
he apply judicial mind to the material on record. Mr. Bhavin
Suchak would submit that in the absence of reproduction or
reference to / of specific words in the complaint, the learned
Magistrate erred in issuing process under section 504 of IPC.
Mr. Bhavin Suchak further submits that the complaint does not
disclose offence punishable under section 506 IPC, and the fact
that not a single person, who allegedly gathered at the scene,
was examined, ought to have persuaded the learned Magistrate
to direct an inquiry, which he failed to do. In rebuttal, the
learned counsel Mr. A.S. Dhore for the complainant would
submit that the complaint and the verification statement do
disclose the necessary ingredients and nothing more was
necessary for the learned Magistrate to issue process.
Mr. A.S. Dhore would emphasize that the order of issuance of
process need not be a speaking order and suffice it if the
material on record disclose the commission of the offence.
Application of mind by the learned Magistrate need not be spelt
out from the reasons recorded and will have to be presumed if
the material on record do disclose the necessary ingredients, is
the submission.
8.               Mr. Bhavin Suchak invites my attention to the
observations of the Hon’ble Supreme Court in M/s. Pepsi Foods
Ltd and Another vs. Special Judicial Magistrate and Others, AIR
1998 SC 128 to buttress the submission that summoning of an
accused in a criminal case is a serious matter. The relevant
observations of the Hon’ble Supreme Court, read thus:
“28. Summoning of an accused in a criminal
case is a serious matter. Criminal law cannot
be set into motion as a matter of course. it is
not that the complainant has to bring only two
witnesses to support his allegations in the
complaint to have the criminal law set into
summoning the accused must reflect that he
has applied his mind to the facts of the case
and the law applicable thereto. He has to
examine the nature of allegations made in the
complaint and the evidence both oral and
documentary in support thereof and would
that be sufficient for the complainant to
accused. It is not that the Magistrate is a silent
preliminary evidence before summoning of the
accused. Magistrate has to carefully scrutinise
the evidence brought on record and may even
himself put questions to the complainant and
his witnesses to elicit answers to find out the
truthfulness of the allegations or otherwise
and then examine if any offence is prima facie
committed by all or any of the accused”.
Mr. Bhavin Suchak then relies on the decision of the Hon’ble
Supreme Court in Vikram Johar vs. State of Uttar Pradesh and
Anr, [Cri. Appeal 759/2019(arising out of SLP (CRI.)
4820/2017)] to buttress the submission that mere allegation
that the accused abused the complainant does not satisfy the
ingredients of section 506 IPC. The Hon’ble Supreme Court
was considering the legality of the order of the learned
Magistrate of rejecting the application for discharge, and the
confirmation of the said order by the High Court.                        The
allegations in the complaint which fell for consideration read
entertain the accused Surveyor Vikaram Johar,
he and 2-3 other unknown persons, one of
complainant’s house on 2.10.2011 at 7.00 Pm
and abused him in filthy language and about
to assault him. When some neighbour arrived
there, the Surveyor Vikaram Johar, he and 2-3
other unknown persons fled the spot on their
complainant has seen the occurrence.”
The Hon’ble Supreme Court, after referring to the earlier
decision in Fiona Shrikhande vs. State of Maharashtra and
Another, 2013(4)RCR (Criminal) 195: (2013) 14 SCC 44 and
Manik Taneja and Another vs. State of Karnataka and Another,
2015(1)RCR (Cri.) 765: (2015)7 SCC 423, held that the
allegations in the complaint, even if taken at face value, do not
disclose the requisite ingredients of offence punishable under
sections 504 or 506 of IPC. It would be apposite to reproduce
the relevant discussion in the said judgment.
“26. Now, we revert back to the allegations in the
complaint against the appellant. The allegation is
that appellant with two or three other unknown
persons, one of whom was holding a revolver, came
to the complainant’s house and abused him in filthy
language and attempted to assault him and when
some neighbours arrived there the appellant and the
other persons accompanying him fled the spot. The
above allegation taking on its face value does not
satisfy the ingredients of Sections 504 and 506 as has
been enumerated by this Court in the above two
judgments. The intentional insult must be of such a
degree that should provoke a person to break the
public peace or to commit any other offence. The
mere allegation that appellant came and abused the
complainant does not satisfy the ingredients as laid
down in paragraph No.13 of the judgment of this
Court in Fiona Shrikhande (supra).
27. Now, reverting back to Section 506, which is
offence of criminal intimidation, the principles laid
down by Fiona Shrikhande (supra) has also to be
applied when question of finding out as to whether
the ingredients of offence are made or not. Here, the
only allegation is that the appellant abused the
complainant. For proving an offence under Section
506 IPC, what are ingredients which have to be
proved by the prosecution? Ratanlal & Dhirajlal on
Law of Crimes, 27th Edition with regard to proof of
(i) That the accused threatened some person.
(ii) That such threat consisted of some injury to his
person, reputation or property; or to the person,
reputation or property of some one in whom he was
(iii) That he did so with intent to cause alarm to that
person; or to cause that person to do any act which
he was not legally bound to do, or omit to do any act
which he was legally entitled to do as a means of
avoiding the execution of such threat.” A plain
reading of the allegations in the complaint does not
satisfy all the ingredients as noticed above.
28. On the principles as enumerated by this Court in
Fiona Shrikhande (supra) and Manik Taneja (supra),
we are satisfied that ingredients of Sections 504 and
506 are not made out from the complaint filed by the
complainant. When the complaint filed under
Section 156(3) Cr.P.C., which has been treated as a
complaint case, does not contain ingredients of
Sections 504 and 506, we are of the view that Courts
below committed error in rejecting the application of
discharge filed by the appellant. In the facts of the
present case, we are of the view that appellant was
entitled to be discharged for the offence under
Sections 504 and 506”.
9.      Mr. Bhavin Suchak further pressed in service the decision
of the Hon’ble Supreme Court in Birla Corporation Limited vs.
Adventz Investments and Holdings Limited and Others,
[(2019) 16 SCC 610] to buttress the submission that
application of judicial mind is condition precedent for initiating
proceedings.
10.              The   learned  counsel   for     the    complainant
Mr. A.S. Dhore would submit that the order of issuance of
process need not be speaking order. Mr. A.S. Dhore invites my
attention to the decision in Dy. Chief Controller of Imports &
Exports vs. Roshanlal Agarwal and Ors [(2003)4 SCC 139 to
buttress the submission that a reasoned order of issuance of
process is not necessary.      The order of issuance of process
which was quashed by the High Court reads thus:
“Cognizance taken. Register the case. Issue
summons to the accused.”
The High Court held that the order of issuance of process did
not show that the learned Magistrate had even perused the
complaint or that he had applied his judicial mind before
taking cognizance.         Disagreeing with the High Court, the
Hon’ble Supreme Court emphasized that for issuance of
process, the Magistrate has to be satisfied of existence of
sufficient ground for proceeding and the Magistrate is not
obligated to record reasons.
11.              Mr. A.S. Dhore, then relies on the decision of the
Hon’ble Supreme Court in UP Pollution Control Board vs.
Mohan Meakins Ltd and Ors [(2002)3 SCC 745] which is
referred to and followed in Dy. Chief Controller of Imports &
Exports vs. Roshanlal Agarwal and Ors. Mr. A.S. Dhore further
relies on the decision of the Hon’ble Supreme Court in Bhushan
Kumar & Anr vs State(Nct Of Delhi) & Anr , (2012)(5) SCC
12.              In my considered view, an order of issuance of
process is not rendered vulnerable due to absence of reasons.
The learned Magistrate is not obligated to record reasons much
less elaborate reasons. While it is trite law that summoning a
person to face criminal prosecution is a serious matter and
judicial mind must be applied to the materiel on record before
issuing process, the application of judicial mind can be inferred
and presumed if the material on record, as is discernible from
the complaint and the verification statement is sufficient to
make out a case for trial.
13.              In the present case, the submission of the accused
is that, even if it is assumed that explicit reasons need not be
recorded in the order, as a fact, the material on record is
grossly insufficient to infer commission of offences punishable
under sections 504 and 506 of IPC. I am in partial agreement
with the said submission in as much as the complaint and the
verification statement, even if taken at face value, do not
disclose the ingredients of section 504 of IPC. The ingredients
are (i) intentional insult (ii) giving provocation to any person
intending or knowing it to be likely that such provocation will
cause him to break the public peace, or to commit any other
offence. All that is alleged, without speling out the words used,
is that the accused abused the complainant. Such allegation
does not satisfy the ingredients of offence punishable under
section 504 of IPC, and to that extent the learned Magistrate
clearly erred in issuing process. However, the ingredients of
section 506 IPC are disclosed and the order of issuance of
process does not suffer from any infirmity, to that extent.
Criminal intimidation is defined in section 503 of IPC.             Threat
of injury to person is alleged in the complaint and the
verification statement. It is specifically alleged that the threat
was issued to force the complainant to give away the land to
the accused. In essence, the allegation is that the threat to kill
was issued to cause the complainant to do any act which he is
not legally bound to do. I am satisfied that no fault can be
found with the order of issuance of process for offence
punishable under section 506 of IPC.
15.              In the light of the discussion supra, the Application
is partly allowed.
16.              The order of issuance of process under section 504
of IPC is quashed and the said order is confirmed to the extent
process is issued for offence punishable under section 506 of
