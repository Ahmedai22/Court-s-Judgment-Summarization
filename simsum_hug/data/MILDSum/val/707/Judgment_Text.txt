Adv. on behalf of Mr. Shobhit Tiwari,
The present writ petition has been filed by the petitioners i.e.
petitioner No.1 who is a candidate and ward of insured person for
the purpose of admission in MBBS/BDS Under Graduate Courses
and petitioner No.2 is the father of the petitioner No.1 claiming
himself to be insured person as per the provisions contained in the
The grievance raised in the present writ petition is in respect
of not treating the petitioner No.1 eligible for the purpose of
admission as ward of insured person and order dated 04.10.2021
issued by the respondent-Corporation is also put to challenge
whereby the petitioner No.1 has not been extended benefit as the
petitioner No.2 is said to be not insured person on 31.03.2021.
The facts of the case in nutshell are that the National Testing
Agency issued a Public Notice inviting Online Applications for
National Eligibility Cum Entrance Test [(NEET (UG)] 2021 for
admission to the undergraduate medical courses.
(3 of 11)               [CW-13178/2021]
The Information Booklet was issued containing detailed
information and as per the Information Booklet, the eligibility
criteria to appear/admission was provided.
The petitioner No.1 finding himself to be eligible in terms of
notice in Information Booklet applied online for NEET (UG) 2021
and he was issued admit card in EWS category.
The petitioner appeared in the examination and result was
declared on 01.11.2021 and petitioner is said to have secured
97.4779718 percentile score and secured 562 marks out of 720
with an All India Rank 38661.
The petitioner has pleaded that on 13.09.2021, Employees’
State Insurance Corporation (hereinafter referred to as “the
ESIC”) issued an admission notice for admission of wards of
insured persons (IPs) in UG Courses and it provided that there
shall be insured persons quota for admission in MBBS/BDS Course
in favour of those candidates, whose either parent is insured
person as on 31.03.2021 and they must have insured person
certificate and the candidate must have ward of insured person
certificate. The said notice further reveals that Clause No.7.10
provided that the critical date for examining eligibility for insured
person (IP) will be 31.03.2021 and Clause No.5.2.2(b) specified
that candidate must have valid Ward of IP Certificate issued by the
The petitioner No.2 has pleaded that the petitioner No.2
being father of the petitioner No.1 had worked on the post of Lab
Assistant    at  MDVM     (Parle)       School,        Neemrana,   Alwar   from
01.01.2017 to 06.05.2020 and while working with such an
employer, the ESI contributions were regularly deposited by the
employer and his account was active. It is pleaded that on account
(4 of 11)                [CW-13178/2021]
of COVID-19 situation and direct impact upon school functioning,
the petitioner No.2 was not continued and as such the petitioner
No.2 got an employment on the post of Lab Assistant in Raffles
University, Neemrana and by issuance of an appointment order
dated 03.03.2021, the petitioner No.2 is said to have joined on
the same day and he has placed on record the attendance register
as Annexure-9 to the writ petition.
The petitioner No.2 has pleaded that Raffles University also
issued the certificate showing the working of the petitioner No.2
as Lab Assistant from 03.03.2021. The petitioner No.2 has also
placed on record his pay slip of March, 2021 and his bank
statement. The pay slip reflects that Rs.148/- were deducted
towards ESI contribution and he was paid gross salary of
Rs.21,000/- and after deduction his net pay was Rs.19,497/-.
The petitioner No.1 applied for issuance of Ward of Insured
Person    Certificate    and     submitted            required   documents      on
23.09.2021 and on the same day, the petitioner No.2 also applied
to ESIC Jaipur for issuance of Ward of Insured Person Certificate in
favour of petitioner No.1.
The petitioners have pleaded that on 04.10.2021, the
application of petitioner No.1 was rejected on the ground that the
petitioner No.2 was not an insured person on 31.03.2021.
The petitioners have pleaded that when they downloaded the
details of insured persons from Portal of ESIC, they found that
current date of appointment of petitioner No.2, is incorrectly
shown as 13.05.2021 instead of 03.03.2021.
The   petitioners       are      said       to      have  given    different
representations to the concerned Authorities for issuance of
(5 of 11)                 [CW-13178/2021]
proper certificate, however, when there was no response from the
respondents, the present writ petition has been filed.
Learned counsel for the petitioner-Mr. Pushpendra Pal Singh
Tanwar appearing on behalf of Mr. Shobhit Tiwari, Adv. has made
following submissions:-
(1)  The Clause No.7.10 of the Admission Notice dated
13.09.2021 provides that eligibility of insured persons for availing
benefits under the Insured Persons Quota for their Ward was
31.03.2021 and since the petitioner No.2 was insured person as
per the Act of 1948 as on 31.03.2021, as such the petitioner No.1
was eligible for availing benefit under the Insured Persons Quota.
The   petitioner   No.2       since       was       in   employment    from
03.03.2021 and if employer had made deduction from the salary
of the petitioner No.2, the petitioner No.2 would be treated to be
insured person as on critical date of 31.03.2021.
(2)   The date of employment, as taken by the respondent-
Corporation of petitioner No.2 with effect from 13.05.2021, is a
wrong act on the part of respondent-Corporation and only if
contribution   was    subsequently          given       by    the employer    and
deposited with the ESIC, the same would not result into depriving
the petitioners from the benefit of insured person. The error of
employer cannot come in the way of getting benefit to the insured
person and relevant date would be the deduction of the
contribution and not depositing the same by the employer to the
(3)  The notice dated 13.09.2021 filed as Annexure-19 with
the rejoinder, provides in Clause 8.3.10 that bonafide status of IPs
who have registered after 31.03.2021 but claim benefit prior to
31.03.2021, may be ensured by the Certificate issuing Authority
(6 of 11)             [CW-13178/2021]
and as such even if the status of the petitioner No.2 has been
registered after 31.03.2021, the same cannot result into depriving
the petitioners from benefits, as the benefit is claimed on the
basis of deduction of the contribution prior to 31.03.2021.
(4)  Learned counsel submitted that issue with regard to the
non payment of contribution and action or non-action of the
employer to deposit the contribution has been considered by the
Apex Court in the case of Bharagath Engineering Vs. R.
Ranganayaki and Ors., 2003 (2) SCC 138.
(5)     The similar controversy has also been examined by the
Kerala High Court in WP (C) No.17305 of 2018 (Hari R. Nair &
Anr. Versus The Director General & Ors.) by judgment dated
Learned counsel-Dr. Arjun Singh Khangarot appearing for the
respondent-ESIC has submitted that the action of the respondents
in denying certificate to the petitioners is justified as the
admission notice dated 13.09.2021 in Clause 8, clearly provides in
its note that critical date for eligibility under IP Quota would be
31.03.2021 i.e. only a person who is a insured person as per the
Act on 31.03.2021, would be eligible for availing benefit for
Insured Persons Quota for his/her child/children.
Learned counsel for the respondent-ESIC submitted that
since on the critical date of 31.03.2021, the petitioner No.2 was
not an insured person and as such no benefit could have been
Learned counsel for the respondent-ESIC further submitted
that as per Para 8 in the reply, the second employer of the
petitioner No.2 had shown the date of appointment of the
(7 of 11)                 [CW-13178/2021]
petitioner No.2 as 31.05.2020 (date of registration 09.06.2020)
and the date of last working day was 30.11.2020.
The respondents have further pleaded that the employer had
shown the date of appointment of the petitioner No.2 as
13.05.2021 while making registration on 22.05.2021 and both the
employer of the petitioner No.2 during the period from April 2020
to November 2020, deposited contribution for a total period of 42
days and therefore as on 31.03.2021, the petitioner No.2 does not
fall within the definition of Insured Person.
Learned    counsel-Mr.        Angad          Mirdha       and  Mr.  Divyesh
Maheshwari appearing for the respondents submitted that the
dispute in the present petition is in respect of not treating the
petitioners eligibility as insured persons and their ward and as
such, this Court is required to decide the controversy after taking
into account the pleas raised by the contesting respondents.
I have considered the submissions made by the learned
counsel for the parties.
This Court finds that the definition of insured person is given
in Section 2 (14) of the Employees’ State Insurance Act, 1948 and
insured person means a person who is or was an employee in
respect of whom contributions are or were payable under the Act
and who by reason thereof, is entitled to any of the benefits
provided by this Act.
This Court further finds that Section 39 of the Act provides
about the contribution and as per clause (a) of sub-section (5) if
any contribution payable under the Act is not paid by the principal
employer on the date on which such contribution has become due,
he is liable to pay simple interest at the rate of 12% per annum or
(8 of 11)             [CW-13178/2021]
at such higher rate, as may be specified in the regulations, till the
date of its actual payment.
Amount of interest recoverable under clause (a) may be
recovered as an arrear of land revenue or under section 45-C to
This Court further finds that Section 68 of the Act deals with
the rights of Corporation where a principal employer fails or
neglects to pay any contribution and provides that if any principal
employer fails or neglects to pay any contribution under the Act
which he is liable to pay in respect of any employee and by reason
thereof such person becomes dis-entitled to any benefit or entitled
to a benefit on a lower scale, the Corporation on being satisfied
that the contribution should have been paid by the principal
employer, may pay to the person the benefit at the rate to which
he would have been entitled if the failure or neglect had not
occurred and the Corporation shall be entitled to recover from the
principal employer either the difference between the amount of
benefit which is paid by the Corporation to the said person and the
amount of the benefit which would have been payable on the basis
of the contributions which were in fact paid by the employer or
twice the amount of the contribution.
The bare reading of aforesaid provisions clearly provides that
the insured person is not only the person who has paid the
contribution but also includes a person whose contribution is
payable and not actually paid due to any reason, like delay, on the
part of employer, etc.
This Court further finds that it is the duty of the principal
employer to pay the contribution under the Act on the date when
it becomes due and if he fails to do so, the Corporation has power
(9 of 11)             [CW-13178/2021]
to recover the same from the principal employer even by charging
This Court further finds that if there is a neglect on the part
of an employer, as per provision contained in Section 68, the
person cannot be declined the benefits or his entitlement if the
employer has failed to deposit the contribution.
This Court finds that in the present facts of the case, the
registration prior to 31.03.2021 is also not very crucial and
important and as per Clause 8.3.10 of notice dated 13.09.2021,
the status of IPs who were registered after 31.03.2021 but claim
benefit prior to 31.03.2021 may be ensured by the Certificate
The facts in the present case show that the petitioner No.2
was employed with the second employer on 03.03.2021, his pay
slip for the month of March 2021 also shows that ESI deduction
was made of Rs.148/- from his salary and the bank statement
along-with pay-slip for the month of March, 2021 also shows that
the petitioner No.2 had received the salary after the deduction of
This Court is not inclined to accept the argument of the
learned counsel for the respondents that since the contribution
was not deposited by the employer with the ESI Corporation and
as such, the petitioner No.1 will not be entitled for issuing
certificate of Ward of Insured Persons. The non-deposit of
contribution in spite of deduction will not make the person dis-
entitle for the benefit of ward of insured person if the insured
person had paid the contribution to his employer prior to
(10 of 11)                [CW-13178/2021]
This Court also finds that merely receiving the contribution,
subsequently after 31.03.2021, by the ESI Corporation and some
information being furnished about employment date of the insured
person showing it to be contrary to the record of the contribution,
will not deprive insured person benefits under the Act.
This Court finds that the Apex Court in the case of Bharagath
Engineering Vs. R. Ranganayaki and Ors. (supra) has clearly held
that the employer cannot be heard to contend that since he had
not deducted the employee’s contribution on the wages of the
employee, he will not be liable. The Apex Court has held that
Section 38 of the Act, casts a statutory obligation on the employer
to insure its employees and the date of commencement has to be
from the date of appointment of the concerned employee.
This Court also finds that the Kerala High Court in the case of
Hari R. Nair & Anr. Versus The Director General & Ors. (supra), has
also considered the similar issue and has found that the
Corporation cannot deny the otherwise eligible insured person, the
certificate on the premise employer contributed or filed the returns
This Court accordingly finds that the respondent-Corporation
has acted arbitrarily in issuing the order dated 04.10.2021 and
accordingly, the same is quashed and set aside.
The petitioner No.1 is held entitled for grant of status as
ward of insured person for the purpose of admission in ESIC
The   respondent-Corporation             would        issue the  necessary
certificate to the petitioner No.1 within the shortest possible time
and preferably within 5 (five) days from the date of this order.
(11 of 11)            [CW-13178/2021]
The petitioner thereafter would be eligible to participate in
the counselling process for the purpose of admission in ESI quota
and if he finds his merit and eligibility, his case will accordingly be
considered by the respondents for the purpose of admission.
Consequently, the present writ petition stands allowed.
