These   intra-Court  appeals     call  in  question    the
judgment dated 03.06.2022 rendered in 1st respondent’s
Writ Petition No.100928/2022 (S-RES). The appeal in W.A.
No.100263/2022 is by the University and the companion
appeal in W.A. No.100264/2022 is by the 3rd respondent in
the writ petition. The said judgment of the learned Single
Judge is to the effect that the writ petitioner should be
appointed to the post of Director, he being the senior most,
and seniority being the sole criteria.
2.    The 1st respondent in both these appeals was
the writ petitioner and he has entered caveat through his
counsel. The 2nd respondent-State is represented by the
learned Government Advocate. 3rd respondent in the Writ
Petition is the appellant in W.A. No.100264/2022. He is
3rd respondent in the companion appeal and is represented
by a private advocate. All the opposing advocates resist
the claim of writ petitioner who opposes the writ appeals.
WA No.100263 of 2022
3rd respondent supports the appeal of University. For
convenience    of  understanding,    the   parties  would   be
referred to with their ranking in the writ petition
a)    Petitioner had knocked at the doors of Writ Court for
assailing the placement of 3rd respondent in the post of
Director of Education and his own placement in the post of
Dean. The sole factor for such a claim was that he was the
senior most in the cadre of Professor. For this petitioner
heavily   banked    upon   the    Government     Order  dated
14.11.2019       and    Chancellor’s     instructions   dated
28.01.2022. Thus, his essential grievance is that he being
the senior most and 3rd respondent admittedly being junior
to him, petitioner ought to have been given the post of
Director and the 3rd respondent could have been made the
b)    The University and the 3rd respondent had opposed
the Writ Petition mainly contending that the appointment in
WA No.100263 of 2022
question is purely temporary and for a period of only six
months; such appointments are to be made on rotation
basis; petitioner was accordingly appointed as a Director
earlier and therefore now the 3rd respondent is given that
position; petitioner cannot have any grievance since he is
given the post of Dean, which is equivalent to that of
c)    The subject letter dated 14.11.2019 issued by the
Under Secretary in the Department of Agriculture, is not a
Government      Order.   The     Chancellor’s   letter dated
28.01.2022 only instructs adherence to the extant norms.
Mr. Jagadish Patil, learned advocate appearing for the 3rd
respondent in the Writ Petition submits that the writ
petitioner has not suffered any legal injury to have
maintained    the  writ  petition.  Learned    GA   made  his
submissions     on   the   position   of    law   maintaining
equi-distance from the warring private parties.
WA No.100263 of 2022
4.    Having heard the learned counsel for the parties
and having perused the appeal papers, we are inclined to
grant indulgence in the matter for the following reasons:
a)    Section 24 of the Universities of Agricultural Sciences
Act, 2009 enlists Officers of the University which, inter alia,
comprise of Directors & Deans. Section 30 empowers the
Vice-Chancellor to appoint officers specified in clauses (iv)
to (ix) of Section 24. It reads as under:
“30. Terms and Conditions of service of other
officers of the University.- The Officers of the
University specified in clause (iv) to (ix) of section
24 shall be appointed by the Vice-Chancellor with
the approval of the Board on such terms and
conditions as may be prescribed:
Provided that the Vice-Chancellor may make
appointments of such officers as a temporary
measure for a period of six months under intimation
to the concerned authority of the University.”
b)    The substantive part in Section 30 provides for
making regular appointment, whereas the proviso provides
for making appointment to the said posts as a ‘temporary
WA No.100263 of 2022
measure’, presumably because regular appointment takes
long time and that posts in question cannot be kept vacant
for long. It is significant to note that this Section speaks of
appointment to specific posts; it specifies the Appointing
Authority i.e., the Vice-Chancellor; provision to the section,
however,     specifies    six  months     as   the  tenure   of
appointment; it also states that such appointments are by
way of temporary measure. It is also significant to note
that the Vice-Chancellor is treated as ‘Conscience Keeper’
of the University concerned, said the Apex Court in
AIR 1989 SC 1582. In the light of all this, the regularity of
the   impugned     proceedings     has  to   be  assumed    and
therefore, the writ petitioner has to make out a very strong
case for interference, this being not a case of regular
c)    The concept of ad hoc appointment is not alien to
Service Jurisprudence; it is a common knowledge that civil
WA No.100263 of 2022
servants are appointed on incharge or independent charge
basis, in the posts only as a temporary measure, under
Rule 32 of KCSRs. In such cases, ordinarily, the seniority
does not much factor. A learned Single Judge of this Court
at para 12 observed as under:
“12. In-charge arrangements and promotion are
well understood in Civil Service. Posting an Officer in
the lower post to discharge the duties of the higher
post   without   promotion    is  only  an  in-charge
arrangement. It is the exigencies of public service
that will be the relevant consideration and not the
consideration   of  seniority    while  making    such
arrangement. A person was posted on independent
charge basis does not hold the post on promotion.
Under Rule 32 of KCSR, any employee in the next
below post/cadre can be placed in charge or
independent charge of a higher post. Similarly, in
accordance    with  Rule   68    of  the  K.C.S.R.    a
Government servant can be appointed to be in-
charge of the current duties of an office in addition
to his own duties. He need not be the senior most.
WA No.100263 of 2022
Generally, such arrangements are made for a short
period.”
d)    Ordinarily seniority has a pivotal role, while making
promotions on regular & substantive basis. However, when
it comes to making ad hoc appointments as the ones at
hands, ordinarily seniority takes the backseat. This is not
to say that the authority in making ad hoc placement can
choose whomsoever it wants; even there the requirement
of fairness & reasonableness cannot be dispensed with. The
proviso to Section 30 does not say anything about seniority
whilst making appointment as a temporary measure. The
appointment process has to be normative since it is done
in the exercise of statutory power, is true. There is some
discretion that avails to the appointing authority even
u/S 30 of the Act also, cannot be disputed. However, any
discretion has to be exercised in accordance with the rules
of Reason & Justice said Lord Halsbury in SHARP VS.
e)    The Board of Management of appellant-University, in
its  meting    held    on  25.01.2019,     resolved   that  such
temporary appointments shall be made on rotation basis.
This resolution gains credence under Section 13(1)(xiv) of
the Act. Following is the text of said Resolution:
Appointment of various posts of Officers on temporary
basis in UAS, Dharwad.
While discussing on this item, the Members of
the Board request to change the incumbent Officers
immediately as has already been resolved by the
Board in its 44th Meeting held on 29.10.2018. There
was also a discussion regarding the possibility of
inter-changing the positions held by Officers. Dr.
P.S.Pandey, Hon’ble Member, suggested that as it is
necessary to follow the provisions of UAS Act and the
practice of inter changing the positions is not correct
and it is not followed in any university including CAU
and hence the rotation has to be made by the fresh
incumbent. It was agreed upon by all the members of
Board of Management and the Board again authorized
the Hon’ble vice-Chancellor and requested to take
suitable temporary measure for a period of six
months inline with the provisions of UAS Act 2009, as
WA No.100263 of 2022
early as possible, till the Officers’ posts are appointed
on regular basis.”
f)     After all in matters of ad hoc appointments, seniority
cannot be the sole/soul mantra. The Board comprising of
high authorities & experts in its wisdom has prescribed the
rule of rotation so that every eligible aspirant for the posts
in question shall get some booster that would go a long
way in his career. It is also a way to attract & retain
talented teachers in the campus. The above Resolution is
not in challenge. In fact, the writ petitioner was appointed
as the Director during the period between 01.08.2018 &
01.02.2019. Therefore, the Vice-Chancellor had no option
than to appoint 3rd respondent as the Director. Had he not
done this, he would have committed an actionable wrong
qua the said respondent. Therefore, petitioner is not
justified in staking his claim to the post in question over
again. An argument to the contrary would breach the Rule
of Rotation promulgated by the August Body of the
University. If a contention to the contrary is accepted, the
WA No.100263 of 2022
senior most person shall continue in the said post beyond
six months only with an artificial break every time which
the law & reason shun. This aspect having not been
discussed in the impugned judgment, there is an error
apparent on its face.
g)     The       vehement         contention          of   learned         counsel
appearing for the petitioner that the Government Order
dated 14.11.2019 mandatorily prescribes the Rule of
Seniority is misconceived. Firstly, it is only an ordinary
letter      issued           by    the        Under        Secretary,          Mr.
H.N.Lakshmanagowda. The same reads as under:

WA No.100263 of 2022
The letter lacks the trappings of a Government Order. This
apart, what authority the Under Secretary had, to prescribe
seniority as the norm for appointments of the kind is not
demonstrated. Learned counsel could not secure any
support from the reading of Section 8 & 10 of the Act to
substantiate his contention that the Government has power
to issue such instructions. Section 8 gives some power,
arguably     true;   however      prescribed    conditions    &
circumstances for such interference are apparently lacking.
Section 10 gives power to the Chancellor to do certain
things at the instance of Government; but the Government
on it’s own can not issue any direction to the University.
h) Universities are not the notional extensions of the
government departments, nor their vassals. They are
autonomous bodies and therefore their autonomy should
be    respected.   The  Secretaries     of  the   Government
Departments cannot interfere in the affairs of Universities
in the absence of statutory power and the justification for
WA No.100263 of 2022
its exercise, both of which are absent in the case at hands.
A learned single Judge of this Court in DR. PARAPPA
ILR 1999 KAR 282 had pungently observed, at paragraph
“10. So far as the second question regarding
powers of the State Government to give directions
to the Universities are concerned, despite turning of
each   page   of  the Universities    Act both   by  the
learned   Advocate-General       as  also  the  Counsel
appearing for the petitioners and the University, no
provision could be located under which the State
Government can give a direction to the University
with regard to the discharge of its functions or
pertaining to the matters which are to be essentially
governed    by   the   statutes     which   are  framed
under Section 35 read with Section 36 of the Act. In
that view of the matter it is expected rather directed
that  the   State   Government       should   henceforth
forbear from giving any direction to any University
established under the Universities Act which are
required to be governed by the specific statutory
provisions or the delegated legislations like the
statutes. Any violation in this regard on the part of
the Government will be dealt with as committing
WA No.100263 of 2022
contempt of this Court. I find making of such
observation is necessary because in various cases I
have found that the Government, of late, have been
prevailing on the Universities which are creatures of
the Act by treating those as departments of the
Government. This impression needs to be dispelled.”
The above observations were made in September 1998
i.e., a little less than a quarter century ago. However, the
governmental authorities being as callous as can be,
continue     to   poke  their  nose    in  the   affairs  of the
Universities. This, we say with no joy in heart. What
further irks us is that the above letter has been issued by
an Under Secretary of the Department, in gross disregard
of the resolution dated 25.01.2019 passed by the Board of
i)     The vehement contention of learned counsel for the
writ petitioner that the matter having been brought to the
notice of the Chancellor, His Excellency has caused a letter
dated 28.01.2022 directing the University to follow the
Rule of Seniority as a norm for making ad hoc appointment
WA No.100263 of 2022
to the posts in question, again is bit difficult to agree with.
That is not its purport. The said letter is reproduced below:
The Special Secretary to Governor,
University of Agricultural Sciences,
Sub: Forwarding of D O Letter of
Ref: D.O. letter No. KLC: CHMN: 1484
: 2022, dated 13-01-2022 from
With reference to the above subject, I am
directed to forward herewith a copy of D.O. letter
cited at reference which is self explanatory.
Further you are directed to ensure strict
compliance         to        the       laid     down
Rules/Statues/Regulations etc., in regard to placing
of Professors Higher Academic Grades and Senior
WA No.100263 of 2022
professors as in-charge of Director/Dean/Registrar
posts.
A perusal of the letter shows that a direction is issued by
the   Chancellor   to   the    University     that     in making
appointment to posts of the kind, the norms laid down in
Rules, Statutes & Regulations should be strictly followed. It
has not said anything about seniority. On the other hand
the Board of Management has consciously prescribed the
norm of rotation, as the mode of appointment. The very
idea of ‘appointment by rotation’ excludes the notion of
seniority. The Vice-Chancellor in issuing the impugned
appointment orders has followed the extant norms. Even
this aspect of the matter has escaped due attention of the
learned Single Judge. Thus, there is an added error
apparent on the face of the impugned judgment.
WA No.100263 of 2022
j)    Learned counsel for the Writ petitioner seeks to
justify the   impugned     Judgment       contending     that  the
University orders that are quashed by the learned Single
Judge   suffered    from   the     infirmity    of  discrimination
inasmuch as only his client was singled out for a step
motherly treatment, all others having been left untouched
even when he had a very short stint of service. We fail to
understand as to how others being not displaced would
come to the rescue of petitioner in matters like this, which
involve  a   host    of factors      that  fall   outside  judicial
evaluation. It is not that the petitioner has been left high &
dry. Admittedly, he too has been given the post of Dean.
The contention that the post of Dean is comparatively a bit
lower compared to that of Director, does not merit deeper
examination, at our hands given the fact that both the
posts carry same pay scale & emoluments. Even the
learned Single Judge treats the posts enlisted in Clauses
(iv) to (ix) of Section 24 as constituting one common
cadre. Clauses 1 & 4 of Section 31 Read with Clauses (iv)
WA No.100263 of 2022
to (ix) of Section 24 of the Act lend some credence to this
view. If the University states that posts are equal, the one
who questions it has to make out a strong case to
substantiate the contra. That being the position, no
prejudice is shown to have been caused to the Writ
petitioner by virtue of impugned orders of the University.
In the above circumstances, these appeals succeed.
The impugned Judgment of the learned Single Judge is set
at naught and as a consequence the University orders of
appointment that were quashed by the said Judgment are
hereby resurrected.
