The petitioner is before this Court calling in question non-
consideration of his candidature under SC, SC/KMS, SC/RL
category owing to his name not being figured in the provisional
select list dated 25-11-2022 published by the 2nd respondent/
Karnataka Public Service Commission (‘the Commission’ for
short)   for  the   post   of  Junior  Assistant/Second     Division
Assistant. The petitioner further seeks a direction by issuance
of a writ in the nature of mandamus to correct the error of the
petitioner which is depicted as him belonging to Scheduled
Tribe to that of Scheduled Caste.
2. Brief facts that lead the petitioner to this court in the
subject petition, as borne out from the pleadings, are as
WP No. 24847 of 2022
The 2nd respondent/Commission issues a Notification on
29-02-2020,     inviting  applications  for  the   post  of  Junior
Assistant/ Second Division Assistant in the Resident Parent
Cadre. The petitioner belongs to Scheduled Caste and finding
himself eligible applies pursuant to the said notification and the
application had been sent through online as required.          The
petitioner claims to have got it typed at a cyber centre and
while filling the application under the category column fills it as
Scheduled Tribe instead of Scheduled Caste. The application
gets uploaded online showing the petitioner as belonging to
Scheduled Tribe instead of Scheduled Caste to which he
actually belongs. Noticing the error, the petitioner again made
efforts to change the category online on 15-07-2021 and claims
that the change was approved on the website. Thinking that he
was a participant under the Scheduled Caste category, the
petitioner participated in the written test which was held on
3. The merit list was then notified of the candidates who
had come within the zone of consideration and the name of the
petitioner did figure in the said merit list securing 163 marks.
After the notification of the merit list, the petitioner was called
WP No. 24847 of 2022
for document verification on 8.09.1922. It was then the
petitioner gets to know that his category has not been changed
from Scheduled Tribe to Scheduled Caste and the error that
had crept in online on 20.03.2020 had become part of the
record. The petitioner then files an affidavit immediately before
the Commission bringing to its notice that it was an error
committed by the cyber centre but he does belong to
Scheduled Caste and a certificate issued to him way back in the
year 2013 certifying his caste. The Commission refused to
accept the change.
4.  The   petitioner  approaches    the   Karnataka   State
Commission     for  Scheduled    Castes   and   Scheduled   Tribes
(‘SC/ST Commission’ for short) venting out his grievance that
he   would   lose   the   opportunity  of   consideration  of   his
candidature for appointment if he is not considered as
belonging to Scheduled Caste. The SC/ST Commission also
requests the 2nd respondent/Commission to consider the case
of the petitioner. The petitioner then represented on 17-09-
2022 and 23-09-2022 with regard to the correction of error. All
these did not yield any result. A provisional select list was
notified on 25-11-2022 and the name of the petitioner did not
WP No. 24847 of 2022
figure in the said list ostensibly for the reason that the
petitioner was treated as belonging to Scheduled Tribe and the
posts reserved for Scheduled Tribe were minimal. It is then, the
petitioner knocked at the doors of this Court in the subject
petition calling in question the aforesaid action.
5. Heard Sri Bola Vedvyas Shenoy, learned counsel
appearing for the petitioner, Smt. Shwetha Krishnappa, learned
Additional Government Advocate and Sri K.M.Prakash, learned
counsel appearing for respondent No.2/Commission.
6. The learned counsel appearing for the petitioner would
contend with vehemence that it is an error on the part of the
person who was uploading the application in cyber centre which
missed the eye of the petitioner as it was uploaded depicting
the petitioner to be belonging as Scheduled Tribe which in fact
is an error and he does belong to Scheduled Caste – Lamani.
Plethora of representations did not yield any result from the
Commission as the Commission was adamant that it would not
change any such error.      He would submit that the petitioner
has secured such marks that he would undoubtedly be
considered if he was treated as Scheduled Caste as he was
WP No. 24847 of 2022
called for document verification and with high marks the
chances of him getting selected is bright in the category of
Scheduled    Caste.   The   error  takes   away   the  right  of
consideration for appointment of the petitioner.
7. On the other hand, the learned counsel representing
the Commission would put up vehement opposition to the plea
of the petitioner contending that if such plea is permitted, it
would open Pandora’s box. He would take this Court through
the Notification to contend that the candidates are bound by
what they have filled up in the application by which they would
either survive or perish. The Commission cannot look into every
case where errors have crept in. It is for the candidates to be
diligent while filling up the application and the Commission
cannot be responsible for any such error and seeks dismissal of
the petition. He would submit that his submissions may be
taken as objections to the petition since the aforesaid error is
the only issue in the case at hand. But, he would admit that the
petitioner does belong to Scheduled Caste.
WP No. 24847 of 2022
8.  I  have   given   my  anxious  consideration   to  the
submissions made by the respective learned counsel and
perused the material on record.
9. The afore-narrated facts are not in dispute. The issue
lies in a narrow compass. The petitioner belongs to Scheduled
Caste ‘Lamani’ and is in possession of a caste certificate issued
by the competent authority depicting him to be a Scheduled
Caste way back on 9-12-2013. It cannot be in dispute that the
petitioner is a Scheduled Caste.      The Commission issued a
Notification on 29-02-2020 calling for applications from eligible
candidates for the post of Junior Assistant/Second Division
Assistant in the Resident Parent Cadre. The petitioner finding
himself eligible to be considerate for the said post files his
application online. While filling the application, the petitioner
erroneously clicks the option Scheduled Tribe instead of
Scheduled Caste notwithstanding the fact that he is a candidate
belonging to Scheduled Caste. It was an error committed while
filing the application online.
10. The petitioner noticed the error at a later point in
time and claims to have made efforts to change the error on
WP No. 24847 of 2022
the website of the Commission from the category of Scheduled
Tribe to Scheduled Caste and claims that the change was
approved on the website. It is after the aforesaid change, the
petitioner participates in the written examination. Results of the
written examination were announced. The petitioner had
secured 163 marks and had been short listed as a candidate in
the select list. All the shortlisted candidates were called for
documents verification on 23-09-2022.      It then the petitioner
gets to know that the change from Scheduled Tribe to
Scheduled Caste has not happened and the error that the
petitioner had committed while filling the application had
become a matter of record.
11. The petitioner immediately submits an affidavit with
regard to the error and brings it to the notice of the
Commission that the change has to be made. The Commission
turned a deaf ear. Helplessly the petitioner then approaches the
SC/ST      Commission      which     also  requests    the     2nd
respondent/Commission to effect the change by indicating that
the petitioner had produced a caste certificate of the year 2013
which clearly depicts that he is a Scheduled Caste and therefore
correction is to be carried out. Even then, the 2nd respondent
WP No. 24847 of 2022
Commission did not accede. Representations were submitted by
the petitioner seeking such change which went in vein. A
provisional    select  list was   notified  on   25-11-2022   and
ostensibly the name of the petitioner did not figure as he was
treated as belonging to Scheduled Tribe and not as Scheduled
Caste and the Commission then tells him that he can be
considered only as a general merit candidate and not as either
Scheduled Caste or Scheduled Tribe. The petitioner submits
objections to the provisional select list again requesting to
rectify the error and when the 2nd respondent /Commission
turned a blind eye and a deaf ear to the plea of the petitioner,
he knocks at the doors of this Court.
12. It is not in dispute that the petitioner is a Scheduled
Caste. Mere error in filling up an application will not change his
caste status. During the time of document verification, the
petitioner had submitted his caste certificate depicting to be
Scheduled Caste. The Commission could have corrected the
error at that time. This human error is glorified by the
Commission by declining to accede to the request for change of
category at the time of document verification. It is not in
dispute that the petitioner has secured high marks and would
WP No. 24847 of 2022
definitely come within the zone of consideration, if he was
treated as a Scheduled Caste candidate. Treating him as a
general merit or Scheduled Tribe candidate has taken away the
consideration        for  appointment      of   the   petitioner.   The
glorification of a trivial human error has resulted in loss of
appointment to the petitioner, a Scheduled Caste candidate.
13. In the aforesaid circumstances, the Apex Court
considering the very issue where the caste certificate itself was
not submitted at the time of filing of the application but was
later submitted holds it to be a curable defect which would not
take away consideration for appointment of a Scheduled Caste
candidate. The Apex Court in the case of RAM KUMAR
GIJROYA v. DELHI SUBORDINATE SERVICES SELECTION
BOARD1, holds as follows:
“14. The Division Bench of the High Court erred in
not considering the decision rendered in Pushpa
[Pushpa v. Govt. (NCT of Delhi), 2009 SCC OnLine Del
281] . In that case, the learned Single Judge of the
High Court had rightly held that the petitioners
therein were entitled to submit the OBC certificate
before the provisional selection list was published
to claim the benefit of the reservation of OBC
category. The learned Single Judge correctly
examined the entire situation not in a pedantic
manner but in the backdrop of the object of
WP No. 24847 of 2022
reservations made to the reserved categories, and
keeping in view the law laid down by a Constitution
Bench of this Court in Indra Sawhney v. Union of
India [Indra Sawhney v. Union of India, 1992 Supp (3)
as well as Valsamma Paul v. Cochin University [Valsamma
Paul v. Cochin University, (1996) 3 SCC 545 : 1996 SCC
(L&S) 772 : (1996) 33 ATC 713] . The learned Single
Judge in Pushpa [Pushpa v. Govt. (NCT of Delhi), 2009
SCC OnLine Del 281] also considered another judgment
of the Delhi High Court, in Tej Pal Singh [Tej Pal
Singh v. Govt. (NCT of Delhi), 1999 SCC OnLine Del 1092
: ILR (2000) 1 Del 298] , wherein the Delhi High Court
had already taken the view that the candidature of those
candidates who belonged to the SC and ST categories
could not be rejected simply on account of the late
submission of caste certificate.
15. The relevant paragraph from the judgment of
this Court in Indra Sawhney [Indra Sawhney v. Union of
(1992) 22 ATC 385] has been extracted in Pushpa
[Pushpa v. Govt. (NCT of Delhi), 2009 SCC OnLine Del
281] along with the speech delivered by Dr Ambedkar in
the Constituent Assembly and reads thus: (Pushpa
case [Pushpa v. Govt. (NCT of Delhi), 2009 SCC OnLine
Del 281] , SCC OnLine Del para 9)
“9. … ‘251. Referring to the concept of
equality of opportunity in public employment, as
embodied in Article 10 of the Draft Constitution,
which finally emerged as Article 16 of the
Constitution, and the conflicting claims of various
communities       for     representation in   public
administration, Dr Ambedkar emphatically declared
that reservation should be confined to “a minority
of seats”, lest the very concept of equality should
be destroyed. In view of its great importance, the
full text of his speech delivered in the Constituent
Assembly on the point is appended to this
judgment. But I shall now read a few passages
from it. Dr Ambedkar stated:
“… firstly, that there shall be equality of
opportunity, secondly, that there shall be
reservations in favour of certain communities which
WP No. 24847 of 2022
have not so far had a ‘proper look-in’ so to say into
the administration. … Supposing, for instance, we
were to concede in full the demand of those
communities who have not been so far employed in
the public services to the fullest extent, what would
really happen is, we shall be completely destroying
the first proposition upon which we are all agreed,
namely, that there shall be an equality of
opportunity. … Therefore the seats to be reserved,
if the reservation is to be consistent with sub-
clause (1) of Article 10, [Ed.: The matter between
two asterisks has been emphasised in Indra
Sawhney case, 1992 Supp (3) SCC 217.] must be
confined to a minority of seats [Ed.: The matter
between two asterisks has been emphasised
in Indra Sawhney case, 1992 Supp (3) SCC 217.] .
It is then only that the first principle could find its
place in the Constitution and effective in operation.
… we have to safeguard two things, namely, the
principle of equality of opportunity and at the same
time satisfy the demand of communities which
have not had so far representation in the State….”
[Constituent Assembly Debates, Vol. 7, pp. 701-02
These words embody the raison d'être of
reservation and its limitations. Reservation is one
of the measures adopted by the Constitution to
remedy the continuing evil effects of prior
inequities stemming from discriminatory practices
against various classes of people which have
resulted in their social, educational and economic
backwardness. Reservation is meant to be
addressed to the present social, educational and
economic backwardness caused by purposeful
societal discrimination. To attack the continuing ill
effects and perpetuation of such injustice, the
Constitution permits and empowers the State to
adopt corrective devices even when they have
discriminatory and exclusionary effects. Any such
measure, insofar as one group is preferred to the
exclusion of another, must necessarily be narrowly
tailored to the achievement of the fundamental
constitutional goal.’ (Indra Sawhney case [Indra
Sawhney v. Union of India, 1992 Supp (3) SCC 217:
WP No. 24847 of 2022
1992 SCC (L&S) Supp 1 : (1992) 22 ATC 385] , SCC pp.
433-34, para 251)”
16. In Pushpa [Pushpa v. Govt. (NCT of Delhi),
2009 SCC OnLine Del 281] , relevant paragraphs from Tej
Pal Singh [Tej Pal Singh v. Govt. (NCT of Delhi), 1999
SCC OnLine Del 1092 : ILR (2000) 1 Del 298] have also
been     extracted,    which     read     thus:    (Pushpa
case [Pushpa v. Govt. (NCT of Delhi), 2009 SCC OnLine
Del 281] , SCC OnLine Del para 11)
“11. … ‘15. The matter can be looked into
from another angle also. As per the advertisement
dated 11-6-1999 issued by the Board, vacancies
are reserved for various categories including SC
category. Thus in order to be considered for the
post reserved for SC category, the requirement is
that a person should belong to SC category. If a
person is SC he is so by birth and not by
acquisition of this category because of any other
event happening at a later stage. A certificate
issued by competent authority to this effect is only
an affirmation of fact which is already in existence.
The purpose of such certificate is to enable the
authorities to believe in the assertion of the
candidate that he belongs to SC category and act
thereon by giving the benefit to such candidate for
his belonging to SC category. It is not that
petitioners did not belong to SC category prior to
30-6-1998 or that acquired the status of being SC
only on the date of issuance of the certificate. In
view of this position, necessitating upon a
certificate dated prior to 30-6-1998 would be
clearly arbitrary and it has no rationale objective
sought to be achieved.
16. While taking a particular view in
such matters one has to keep in mind the
objectives behind the post of SC and ST
categories as per constitutional mandate
prescribed in Articles 15(4) and 16(4) which
are enabling provisions authorising the
Government to make special provisions for
the persons of SC and ST categories. Articles
14(4) and 16(4), therefore, intend to remove
social and economic inequality to make equal
WP No. 24847 of 2022
opportunities available in reality. Social and
economic justice is a right enshrined for
protection of society. The right in social and
economic justice envisaged in the Preamble
and elongated in the fundamental rights and
directive principles of the Constitution, in
particular Articles 14, 15, 16, 21, 38, 39 and
46 are to make the quality of the life of the
poor, disadvantaged and disabled citizens of
the society meaningful.’ (Tej Pal Singh
case [Tej Pal Singh v. Govt. (NCT of Delhi),
298] , SCC OnLine Del paras 15-16)”.
The Apex Court endorses/affirms the view of the Delhi High
Court in the case of PUSHPA v. GOVERNMENT, NCT OF
DELHI2. That was a case where a Scheduled Caste candidate
had been denied appointment on the ground that the caste
certificate had not been appended to the application. The Delhi
High Court had held as follows:
“7. Caste is the only accepted criteria to identify
under-represented groups. The underlying theory is that
the under-representation of the identifiable groups is a
legacy of the Indian caste system. After India gained
independence, the Constitution of India listed some
erstwhile groups as Scheduled Castes (SC) and Scheduled
Tribes (ST). The framers of the Constitution believed that,
due to the caste system, SCs and the STs were
historically oppressed and denied respect and equal
opportunity in Indian society and were thus under-
represented       in nation-building   activities.   Later,
reservations were introduced for other sections as well.
8. The principle of equality permeates the
Constitution of India. All the citizens are entitled to be
treated by the state equally, irrespective of their caste,
race, religion, sex, descent, place of birth and residence.
No citizen may be discriminated against by the state only
on any of these grounds. The exceptions to this principle
are made in favour of women and children, the backward
classes, the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes,
and the weaker sections.
9. Referring to the reasons for reservation, the
Hon'ble Apex Court in Indra Sawhney v. Union of
India, 1992 Supp (3) SCC 217, observed as under:
“251. Referring to the concept of equality of
opportunity in public employment, as embodied in
Article 10 of the draft Constitution, which finally
emerged as Article 16 of the Constitution, and the
conflicting claims of various communities for
representation     in    public  administration,   Dr
Ambedkar emphatically declared that reservation
should be confined to ‘a minority of seats’, lest the
very concept of equality should be destroyed. In
view of its great importance, the full text of his
speech delivered in the Constituent Assembly on
the point is appended to this judgment. But I shall
now read a few passages from it. Dr Ambedkar
“… firstly, that there shall be equality of
opportunity, secondly, that there shall be
reservations in favour of certain communities which
have not so far had a ‘proper look-in’ so to say into
the administration… Supposing, for instance, we
were to concede in full the demand of those
communities who have not been so far employed in
the public services to the fullest extent, what would
really happen is, we shall be completely destroying

namely, that there shall be an equality of
opportunity…Therefore the seats to be reserved, if
the reservation is to be consistent with sub-clause
(1) of Article 10, must be confined to a minority of
seats. It is then only that the first principle could
find its place in the Constitution and effective in
operation … we have to safeguard two things,
WP No. 24847 of 2022
namely, the principle of equality of opportunity and
at the same time satisfy the demand of
communities which have not had so far
representation in the State, …”. Constituent
Assembly Debates, Vol. 7, pp.701-702 (1948-49).
(emphasis supplied)
These words embody the raison d'etre of
reservation and its limitations. Reservation is one
of the measures adopted by the Constitution to
remedy the continuing evil effects of prior
inequities stemming from discriminatory practices
against various classes of people which have
resulted in their social, educational and economic
backwardness. Reservation is meant to be
addressed to the present social, educational and
economic backwardness caused by purposeful
societal discrimination. To attack the continuing ill
effects and perpetuation of such injustice, the
Constitution permits and empowers the State to
adopt corrective devices even when they have
discriminatory and exclusionary effects. Any such
measure, in so far as one group is preferred to the
exclusion of another, must necessarily be narrowly
tailored to the achievement of the fundamental
constitutional goal.”
10. Keeping this in mind and considering that the
petitioner applied for the OBC certificate to the concerned
office of SDM much before January 2008, when the
advertisement was made by DSSSB and since the
certificate was made available to the petitioner on
13/5/2008, the petitioner cannot be made to suffer for
the lapse on the part of the SDM office. But at the same
time it is made clear that in all such cases caste
certificate should reach the Board prior to their making
provisional selection as while making provisional
selection, the Board verifies & satisfies itself with
authenticity of documents and eligibility as per the
recruitment rules. Herein, the petitioner had sent the
documents vide letter dated 3/7/2008, prior to
publication of the provisional results on 25/7/2008.
11. The issue is also no more res integra as in
the case of Tej Pal Singh v. Govt. of NCT of
Delhi, (2005) 120 DLT 117 this Court has already
WP No. 24847 of 2022
taken a view that the candidates who belong to ‘SC’
and ‘ST’ categories but could not file certificate in
proof of the same could not have been rejected
simply on account of the late submission of the
certificates and submission of such certificates
cannot be made a pre-condition for accepting the
application forms. The relevant para of the said
judgment is reproduced as under:
“17. The matter can be looked into from
another angle also. As per the advertisement dated
11th June, 1999 issued by the Board, vacancies are
reserved for various categories including ‘SC’
category. Thus in order to be considered for the
post reserved for ‘SC’ category, the requirement is
that a person should belong to ‘SC’ category. If a
person is SC his is so by birth and not by
acquisition of this category because of any other
event happening at a later stage. A certificate
issued by competent authority to this effect is only
an affirmation of fact which is already in existence.
The purpose of such certificate is to enable the
authorities to believe in the assertion of the
candidate that he belongs to ‘SC’ category and act
thereon by giving the benefit to such candidate for
his belonging to ‘SC’ category. It is not that
petitioners did not belong to ‘SC’ category prior to
30th June, 1998 or that acquired the status of
being ‘SC’ only on the date of issuance of the
certificate. In view of this position, necessitating
upon a certificate dated prior to 30th June, 1998
would be clearly arbitrary and it has no rationale
objective sought to be achieved.”
The observations above were affirmed by the Apex Court in the
case of RAM KUMAR GIJROYA. The afore-quoted cases were
the cases where the caste certificate itself was not appended. If
that cannot be glorified as an error and that error had been set
WP No. 24847 of 2022
at naught by the constitutional Courts; the error in the case at
hand is only trivial. A triviality cannot take away the right of a
Scheduled Caste candidate for consideration of his case as a
candidate belonging to Scheduled Caste.
14. The learned counsel for the petitioner would now
submit that a final select list is also notified by the Commission
during the pendency of the writ petition and therefore, a
direction is required to be given to the Commission to include
the name of the petitioner in the select list according to his
merit vis-à-vis the candidate who is less meritorious than that
of the petitioner in the category of Scheduled Caste.           Here
again the learned counsel appearing for the Commission
submits that this would open Pandora’s box and become a
precedent.     I decline    to   accept the      submission of    the
Commission, if this order opens up Pandora’s box; so be it, if it
becomes a precedent; so be that. This Court would not turn a
deaf ear to a cry of a Scheduled Caste candidate who has
scored    high  marks,    despite       the trials  and  tribulations
throughout that they face to lose the opportunity of getting
selected for trivial reasons.      The Commission ought to have
corrected the trivial human error when the petitioner pointed it
WP No. 24847 of 2022
out at the time of document verification. Having not done so,
the Commission cannot now contend that this order would open
up Pandora’s box or become a precedent.                     It cannot be
forgotten that, “to err is human”, infallibility is unknown
to humanity.
15. For the aforesaid reasons, I pass the following:
(i)          The Writ Petition is allowed.
(ii)         A mandamus issues 2nd respondent/Commission
to rectify the error and treat the petitioner as
one belonging to Scheduled Caste and regulate
the provisional/final select list in accordance with
the merit of the petitioner under the category of
Scheduled Caste with all consequential benefits
flowing thereto.
(iii)        The aforesaid action shall be carried out within a
period of 2 weeks’ from the date of receipt of a
copy of this order.
