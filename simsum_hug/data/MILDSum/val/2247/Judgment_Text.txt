Petitioner, party-in-person is knocking at the doors of

2.     The structure of the writ petitions and the prayers
made therein leave no manner of doubt that there is
something wrong with the petitioner party-in-person; these
are all again the cases of abuse of judicial process; earlier
too he had filed dozens of such cases which essentially
related    to    his   grievance     as    to   education;   in
W.P.No.1355/2021        (Edn-Res)     &    connected    matters
disposed off on 19.05.2021 by a Co-ordinate Bench, it is
observed at para 7 of the order as under:
“ In consideration whereof this Court would
proceed to hold that the writ petitions filed by
the petitioner is a blatant abuse of the
process of this court. There is absolutely no
merit in these writ petitions. Therefore, while
dismissing the writ petitions, it is hereby
directed that the petitioner shall be precluded
from filing any other writ petitions in this regard.
The petitioner, no doubt, is required to be
saddled with exemplary costs, but payment of
costs shall stand deferred. If the petitioner files
any other writ petition/proceedings, in this
regard, office shall put up a note regarding the
directions issued hereby. The petitioner shall be
called upon to deposit Rs.1,00,000/- (Rupees
one lakh) ….”
3.         Petitioner   party-in-person admittedly has not
remitted the cost of Rs.1,00,000/- (Rupees one lakh) only
levied by the Co-ordinate Bench for “blatantly” abusing the
process of this Court; the vehement contention of the
petitioner that what happened in the other case and what
directions have been given therein are irrelevant to the
adjudication of these cases at hands now; this is bit difficult
to countenance; the Writ Court will not permit a person who
abuses its process, to invoke the constitutional jurisdiction
vested in it under Articles 226 & 227; filing of case after case
absolutely without justification is nothing but an aggravated
form of abuse of process of the court; the valuable time spent
by this court in deciding these frivolous matters could have
been invested in worthy causes.
In the above circumstances, these writ petitions being
absolutely unmeritorious and calculated to abuse the process
of the court, are liable to be rejected in limine            and
accordingly they are with a cost of Rs.10,000/- each;
petitioner shall deposit the said cost with the Registry within
a period of four weeks, failing which the Registry shall
institute the contempt proceedings for recovering the same.
