Advocate, Mr. J.F. Mehta, for the opponent.
4.   Learned Advocate, Mr. Kansara, appearing for the
applicant       submitted   that    the   present    opponent,            in
connivance          with    one        Parsottamdas         Savjibhai
Chovatiya, filed Special Civil Suit No. 540 of 2016,
before the Court of the learned 4th Addl. Senior Civil
Judge,      Mirzapur,     Ahmedabad       (Rural).     During           the
pendency of the aforesaid Suit, the parties settled
their disputes and a consent decree was passed by the
concerned Civil Court on 09.09.2017.
4.1 It was submitted that the present applicant was
not a party to the said Civil Suit and therefore,
when she came to know about the decree passed by the
concerned Civil Court, the applicant filed Leave to
Appeal before this Court along with Civil Application
No. 1474 of 2020 for condonation of delay.
4.2 It was submitted that looking to the facts of
the case, this Court vide order, dated 17.03.2020,
issued Rule and also granted ad-interim-relief, by
directing that the opponent to maintain status quo
with regard to the title and the encumbrance of the
suit property, till the returnable date.
4.3 The          applicant,    thereafter,        submitted               an
application        before the concerned Executing Court in
January, 2021, where, the execution proceedings were
pending. A copy of the said application is produced
at Page-209 of the compilation.
4.4 It      appears      that,  pursuant       to    the    above,          the
present     opponent      also   filed      an   application           before
this Court on 17.03.2021 for vacating the interim
relief     granted       by   this     Court     vide     order         dated
17.03.2020.         A   copy   of    the     said    application              is
produced at Page-213 of the compilation.
4.5 Learned           Advocate,      Mr.      Kansara,        therefore,
submitted that the present opponent was fully aware
of the order passed by this Court on 17.03.2020,
whereby, the opponent has been directed to maintain
status quo with regard to the title and encumbrance
on the Suit property.
4.6 Learned Advocate, Mr. Kansara, submitted that an
application for modification of the sale deed was
filed by the opponent in the execution proceedings,
which    was       pending   before      the   concerned        Execution
4.7 It       was      submitted     that      on    20.11.2019,             the
Executing Court passed the order below application
Exhibit-37, which was filed by the opponent, wherein,
it has been specifically observed that the present
opponent as well as Parsottamdas Savjibhai Chovatiya
do not have any title documents in respect of the
Suit land, including the sub-plots.
4.8 It was submitted that in spite of the aforesaid
order, which was passed on 20.11.2019, the present
opponent         submitted    an      application         before            the
concerned Revenue Authority for mutation of the entry
in the revenue record, on the basis of the registered
Sale     Deed       executed    by        Parsottamdas          Savjibhai
Chovatiya in favour of the opponent. On the basis of
the Execution Proceedings No. 17 of 2017, aforesaid
application was submitted on 08.04.2021, which was
served on the Revenue Authority on 25.05.2021.
4.9 Learned          Advocate,      Mr.      Kansara,         therefore,
submitted        that   the  opponent        has   given        the       said
application with a view to create clout on the Suit
property,        which   is  nothing,        but,    an     attempt           to
overreach the process of this Court as well as the
order passed by this Court on 17.03.2020.
4.10 Learned Advocate, Mr. Kansara, hence, urged that
the proceedings under the Contempt Act be initiated
against the opponent.
4.11 Learned       Advocate,   Mr.       Kansara,    submitted            that
even in the affidavit filed by the opponent, she does
not dispute the aforesaid aspect.
4.12 In support of his submissions, learned Advocate,
Mr. Kansara, has placed reliance on the decision of
the Hon’ble Apex Court in the case of                         ‘SULOCHANA
OTHERS’,        reported    in     (2010)       8   SCC      467,         more
particularly, the observations made in Paragraph-14
5.   On the other hand, learned Advocate, Mr. Mehta,
appearing for the opponent has strongly opposed this
application        and  has    submitted        that     there         is     no
willful      or    intentional     disobedience        of     the       order
passed by this Court on 17.03.2020.
5.1 It was submitted that the present opponent, in
fact, has maintained the status quo with regard to
the title and there is no encumbrance on the suit
property, as is submitted by the applicant, herein.
5.2 Learned Advocate, Mr. Mehta, submitted that the
application        was   given     to       the   concerned         Revenue
Authority for mutation of the entry on the basis of
the Execution Proceedings and the Revenue Authority
has simply recorded the same.
5.2.1        Learned Advocate, Mr. Mehta, submitted that
the order certifying the said entry has, now, been
set aside by the appellate authority.
5.3 It       was,    therefore,        urged     that     the       present
application may not be entertained.
6.   We     have    heard   the    learned       Advocates        for       the
parties and have also perused the material on record.
This Court passed following order on 17.03.2020;
“Rule returnable        on 15.04.2020.       Normally before
adjudication of the issue of delay, this Court would not
issue an injunction; however, in view of peculiar facts
emerging from the submissions of learned counsel for
the applicant that the applicant is a title holder of the suit
property and has not conveyed the title either directly or
through power of attorney; and that the opponents in
collusion; instituted a suit and invited a decree on
compromise as also they in collusion instituted the
execution    petition    whereupon      despite    the     original
defendant having no title to the disputed property was
able to convey the applicant's title, the opponents are
directed to maintain the status-quo with regard to the title
and encumbrance of the suit property till the returnable
date. Direct service is permitted.“
6.1 It is the case of the applicant that after the
aforesaid         order     was     passed         by   this     Court,          the
opponent, herein, submitted an application before the
Revenue Authority and on the basis of the same, Entry
No.   12813        came    to   be      mutated       in   the     record          on
25.03.2021         with    regard       to       the  Suit    property           and
thereby, the opponent has willfully and intentionally
disobeyed the order dated 17.03.2020.
6.2 Here, it is pertinent to note that the present
opponent         has     neither          got       the    Suit        property
transferred nor is there any encumbrance created on
the same, as is submitted by the applicant.
6.3 It        would       be      relevant          to    refer        to        the
observations made by the Apex Court at Paragraph-14
in  the       case     of     ‘SULOCHANA          CHANDRAKANT          GALANDE’
(Supra), which reads thus;
“14. "Encumbrance" actually means the burden caused
by an act or omission of man and not that created by
nature. It means a burden or charge upon property or a
claim or lien on the land. It means a legal liability on
property. Thus, it constitutes a burden on the title which
diminishes the value of the land. It may be a mortgage or
a deed of trust or a lien of              an easement. An
encumbrance, thus, must be a charge on the property. It
must run with the property. (Vide Collector of Bombay
Ors., AIR 2005 SC 954; and AI Champdany Industries
6.4 From the aforesaid observations made by the Apex
Court, it becomes clear that an encumbrance must be a
charge    on      the   property        and      it  must    run     with        the
6.4.1        In the case on hand, there does not appear
to  be     any      encumbrance         on      the   Suit    property           and
therefore, the contention raised by learned Advocate,
Mr. Kansara, is misconceived.
6.5 It is contended, in this application, that the
opponent was very well aware of the order passed by
this Court on 17.03.2020, as after the filing of the
application          by   the    applicant        in    the       execution
proceedings before the Executing Court, the opponent,
herein, also preferred an application, for vacating
ad-interim-relief           and    despite       that     the       opponent
submitted an application for mutation of entry in the
revenue record.
6.5.1        Aforesaid contention raised on behalf of the
applicant is also misconceived, for the simple reason
that there is no breach of status quo with regard to
the title and the encumbrance of the suit property,
in any manner, as observed herein above.
6.6 Just because the opponent made an application
for   entering        her   name    in      the  revenue       record,          it
cannot be said that there is willful and intentional
disobedience          of   the   order        of  this     Court          dated
6.7 Here, it is pertinent to note that the present
applicant        challenged       the       order    of    the        revenue
authority,         certifying    the       entry   in   favour         of     the
opponent,        before    the    appellate       authority         and       the
appellate       authority      has    ordered      to   set     aside         the
order certifying the said entry.
6.8 For the reasons stated herein above, this Court
is of the considered view that there is no willful or
intentional disobedience of the order of this Court
dated 17.03.2020 on the part of the opponent. This
application, therefore, deserves to be dismissed.
7.      Resultantly, this    application    fails        and        is
accordingly, REJECTED. Rule is discharged.
