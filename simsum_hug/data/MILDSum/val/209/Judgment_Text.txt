Name of counsel for parties    For Petitioner : Shri Shri Akash Choudhary,
learned counsel.
Jain, learned counsel.
Law laid down                  If a sister is not included as a dependent
under Clause 9.3.3 of NCWA then the same
would amount to a clear case of gender bias
which is against the spirit of Article 14, 15,
16 and 39 (a) of the Constitution of India.
Clause 9.3.3 of NCWA is declared to be
unreasonable, unjustified and contrary to the
view taken in Madhubala Sinha (supra) and
by the Full Bench in the case of Meenakshi
Dubey (supra), which would not come in
way of the petitioner for granting her
compassionate appointment.
Significant paragraph numbers Para Nos. 9 & 10.
This petition coming for admission on this day, the court passed
This petition has been filed under Article 226 of the Constitution
of India, challenging the order dated 09.07.2021 (Annexure P/1),
whereby the claim of the petitioner for grant of compassionate
appointment has been rejected by the respondents on the ground that
there is no provision in the respondent-establishment to grant
compassionate appointment to a married daughter.
2.     Brief facts leading to filing of this petition are that father of the
petitioner late Shri Abdul Latif Siddiqui, who was working on the post
of Dumper Operator (hereinafter referred to as the 'workman'), died in
the year 2008 while in service. Thereafter, elder son of the workman
namely Mohammad Sajid Siddiqui was granted compassionate
appointment in the year, 2009 on the post of General Majdoor.
Unfortunately, Mohammad Sajid Siddiqui also died in a road accident.
After the death of Mohammad Sajid Siddiqui, younger son of workman
namely Shri Zakir Siddiqui was granted appointment on compassionate
basis on the post of General Majdoor Category-1 vide order dated
01.11.2016. The workman has two sons and one daughter alongwith
wife in his family. After the death of father and elder brother, Zakir
Siddiqui was taking care of the family as he was granted compassionate
appointment by the respondents. Unfortunately, he also died.
Thereafter, the wife of the workman submitted a representation to the
authorities to grant compassionate appointment to the only surviving
child i.e. petitioner No.2 Ku. Sulekha Siddiqui. The application was
rejected vide order dated 09.07.2021 on the ground that Clause 9.3.0 of
the National Coal Wage Agreement (NCWA) forbids grant of
compassionate appointment to a daughter, and therefore, the same
cannot be granted.
3.     Being aggrieved by the said order, the petition has been filed
seeking quashment of the order and also the provisions of the Policy of
the respondent-establishment under which Clause 9.3.3 prohibiting the
married daughter from the benefit of grant of compassionate
4.     Learned counsel for the petitioner has relied upon the decision
passed by the Full Bench in W.A.No.756/2019 (Minakshi Dubey vs.
M.P.P.K.V.V.C.L and others. Learned counsel has also placed reliance
on the judgment passed by the Division Bench of the Jharkhand High
Court at Ranchi in LPA No.617/2017 (Madhubala Sinha vs. M/s
Central Coalfields Ltd. and other), in which Hon’ble High Court has
categorically held as under:-
“24, So far as the sister is concerned, we find from a
plain reading of Clause 9.3.3 of NCWA quoted above that
the brother of the deceased workman dying unmarried, if
fully dependent upon him, is also entitled to be
considered for appointment on compassionate ground. In
that view of the matter, there is no reason as lo why,
sister, whether married Or unmarried, should be deprived
ofsuch benefit. If a sister is denied the benefit of
compassionate appointment only on the ground that she
is not included as dependent under Clause 9.3.3 of
NCWA, this is a clear case of gender bias and the same
cannot be sustained in the eyes of law, also on the
touchstone of Articles 14 and 15 of the Constitution of
India. At this Juncture, we are tempted to quote Section
L3 of the General Clauses Act, even though the General
Clauses Act relates to Central Acts and Regulations. We
are referring to this Section as admittedly the respondent
Coal India Ltd is also ‘State’ within the meaning of
Article 12 of the Constitution of India, and Section 13 of
the General Clauses Act aims at nondiscrimination only
on the basis of gender. In other words, it prohibits gender
discrimination. Section 13 of the General Clauses Act
reads as follows:-
"13. Gender and number.- In all Central Acts
and Regulations, unless there is anything
repugnant in the subject or context;—
(1) words importing the masculine gender shall be
taken to include females; and
(2) words in the singular shall include the plural,
and vice-versa.”
A plain reading of this Section clearly shows that all the
words importing the masculine gender shall be taken to
include females and in that view of the matter also, if
brother is included in the list of dependents under Clause
9.3.3 of NCWA, there is no reason as to why the word
‘brother' shall not include sister also.
25. We are of the considered view that the case of the
appellants is fully covered by the decisions relied upon
by learned counsels for the appellants herein before. The
non-inclusion of the parents and sister of the deceased
workman dying in harness, in the list of dependents to be
appointed on compassionate ground, cannot be said to be
based on any rational basis, rather this is wholly unfair
and absolutely unjust. It is also not based on any
intelligible differentia, and frustrates the very object the
scheme for compassionate appointment. These
immediate blood relations cannot be denied the benefit
of compassionate appointment, if they are otherwise
entitled for the same, simply because of the fact that they
may be entitled to the compensation under the workman
compensation benefits admissible under the Workmen's
Compensation Act, as they fall within the definition of
‘dependent’ given in Section 2(1)(q) of the said Act.”
5.    Shri Greeshm Jain, learned counsel for the respondents has also
submitted and relied upon the reply filed by them saying that Clause
9.3.3 of National Coal Wage Agreement is applicable all over in Coal
India and its subsidiaries. He submits that a joint bi-partite agreement
has been executed between the CIL Management and Four Central
Trade Unions. He submits that JBCCI is also a necessary party which
has played important role in formulating the National Coal Wage
Agreement (NCWA) and, therefore, without impleading it as a party,
the writ petition is liable to be dismissed as the same suffers from non-
joinder of necessary party. It is also stated by the respondents that the
deceased employee left behind him two sons and a daughter. As per
NCWA if son is available then he gets priority over any other
dependent. There is no provision of providing compassioante
appointment to the sisiter of the deceased brother Zakir Siddiqui.
Therefore,     petitioner  was    rightly  denied     the   compassionate
appointment. The fact regarding the dependency of the present
petitioner with the parents was also denied. It is stated by learned
counsel for the respondent that grant of compassionate appointment is
not an additional method of providing the employment violating Article
14 of the Constitution of India but this is provided with an object to
provide social security to the bereaved family. He submits that there is
no infirmity and illegality in Clause 9.3.3 of NCWA and therefore the
same cannot be declared illegal.
6.     Learned counsel further submitted that a new National Coal
Wage Agreement (NCWA) has come into force w.e.f. 2018, in which
also there is no provision for grant of compassionate appointment to the
married daughter/sister. It is further submitted that W.A.No.673/2019
arising out of W.P.No.13598/2016 as well as W.A.No.399/2021 arising
out of W.P.No.13651/2016 are pending before the Division Bench for
7.     Heard the learned counsel for the parties.
8.     After taking into consideration, the identical orders passed by the
Coordinate Bench of this Court in W.P.No.13598/2016 as well as in
W.P.No.13561/2016 and also considering the view taken by the Full
Bench in the case of Meenakshi Dubey (supra), this Court is of the
opinion that Clause 9.3.3 of NCWA runs contrary to Articles 14,15,16
and 39(a) of Constitution of India. Taking note of various judgments of
Supreme Court, this Court in Meenakshi Dubey (supra) in paras
13,17,18 and 19 has observed as under :-
The common string in the aforesaid judgments of various
High Courts is clear like a cloudless sky that the
action/clauses of the policy which deprives married
daughter from right of consideration for compassionate
appointment runs contrary to Articles 14, 15, 16 and
39(a) of the Constitution. We concur with the above view
taken by various High Courts. We are not oblivious of the
settled legal position that compassionate appointment is
an exception to general rule. As per the policy of
compassionate appointment, State has already decided to
consider claims of the married daughters (Clause 2.4) for
compassionate appointment but such consideration was
confined to such daughters who have no brothers. After
the death of government servant, it is open to the spouse
to decide and opt whether his/her son or daughter is best
suited for compassionate appointment and take
responsibilities towards family which were being
discharged by the deceased government servant earlier.
The offending clause which restricts such consideration
only for such married daughter is subject matter of
consideration and examination. The Constitution Bench
of Supreme Court in Budhan Choudhry(Supra) held that
substantive law, procedural law or even an action can be
interfered with if it does not pass the "litmus test", laid
down in the said case. Hence, in a case of this nature,
adjudication is not required regarding creation of right of
married woman, indeed, judicial review is focused
against curtailment of claim of such married woman
when deceased government servant died leaving behind
18. The matter may be viewed from another angle.
Human rights and fundamental freedom have been
reiterated by the Universal Declaration of Human
Rights. Democracy, development and respect for human
rights and fundamental freedoms are interdependent and
have mutual reinforcement. All forms of discrimination
on grounds of gender is violative of fundamental
freedoms and human rights. Vienna Convention on the
Elimination of all forms of Discrimination Against
Women (for short 'CEDAW) was ratified by the UNO on
18-12-1979. The Government of India who was an
active participant to CEDAW ratified it on 19-6-1993
and acceded to CEDAW on 8-8-1993 with reservation
on Articles 5(e), 16(1), 16(2) and 29 thereof. The
Preamble of CEDAW reiterates that discrimination
against women violates the principles of equality of
rights and respect for human dignity; is an obstacle to
the participation on equal terms with men in the
political, social, economic and cultural life of their
country; hampers the growth of the personality from
society and family and makes it more difficult for the
full development of potentialities of women in the
service of their countries and of humanity. Article 1
defines discrimination against women to mean -any
distinction, exclusion or restriction made on the basis of
sex which has the effect or purpose on impairing or
nullifying the recognized enjoyment or exercise by
women, irrespective of their marital status, on a basis of
equality of men and women, all human rights and
fundamental freedoms in the political, economic, social,
cultural, civil or any other field. Article 2(b) makes it
obligatory for the State parties while condemning
discrimination against women in all its forms, to pursue,
by appropriate means, without delay, elimination of
discrimination against women by adopting "appropriate
legislative and other measures including sanctions where
appropriate, prohibiting all discriminations against
women" to take all appropriate measures including
legislation, to modify or abolish existing laws,
regulations, customs and practices which constitute
discrimination against women. Clause (C) enjoins to
ensure legal protection of the rights of women on equal
basis with men through constituted national tribunals
and other public institutions against any act of
discrimination to provide effective protection to women.
Article 3 enjoins State parties that it shall take, in all
fields, in particular, in the political, social, economic and
cultural fields, all appropriate measures including
legislation to ensure full development and advancement
of women for the purpose of guaranteeing them the
exercise and enjoyment of human rights and
fundamental freedoms on the basis of equality with men.
Article 13 states that - "the State parties shall take all
appropriate measures to eliminate discrimination against
women in other areas of economic and social life in
order to ensure, on a basis of equality of men and
women. Parliament has enacted the Protection of Human
Rights Act, 1993. Section 2(d) defines human rights to
mean the rights relating to life, liberty, equality and
dignity of the individual guaranteed by the Constitution
or embodied in the International Covenants and
enforceable by courts in India. Thereby the principles
embodied in CEDAW and the concomitant Right to
Development became integral parts of the Indian
Constitution and the Human Rights Act and became
enforceable. Section 12 of Protection of Human Rights
Act charges the Commission with duty for proper
implementation as well as prevention of violation of the
human rights and fundamental freedoms. Article 5(a) of
CEDAW on which the Government of India expressed
reservation does not stand in its way and in fact Article
2(f) denudes its effect and enjoins to implement Article
2(f) read with its obligation undertaken under Articles 3,
14 and 15 of the Convention vis-a-vis Articles 1, 3, 6
and 8 of the Declaration of Right to Development.
Though the directive principles and fundamental rights
provide the matrix for development of human
personality and elimination of discrimination, these
conventions add urgency and need for immediate
implementation. It is, therefore, imperative for the State
to eliminate obstacles, prohibit all gender-based
discriminations as mandated by Articles 14 and 15 of the
Constitution of India. By operation of Article 2(f) and
other related articles of CEDAW, the State should by
appropriate measures modify law/policy and abolish
gender-based discrimination in the existing laws,
regulations, customs and practices which constitute
discrimination against women.
19. In a recent judgment reported in 2020 SCC OnLine
SC 200 (Secretary, Ministry of Defence vs. Babita
Puniya and others), the Apex Court opined that - 67.
The policy decision of the Union Government is a
recognition of the right of women officers to equality of
opportunity. One facet of that right is the principle of
nondiscrimination on the ground of sex which is
embodied in Article 15(1) of the Constitution. The
second facet of the right is equality of opportunity for
all citizens in matters of public employment under
Article 16(1) This recent judgment in Babita
Puniya(Supra) is a very important step to ensure Gender
Justice. In view of catena of judgments referred
hereinabove, it can be safely concluded that Clause 2.2
to the extent it deprives married woman from right of
consideration for compassionate appointment violates
equality clause and cannot be countenanced. By
introducing Clause 2.4, the Government partially
recognised the right of consideration of married
daughter but such consideration was confined to such
daughters who have no brothers. Clause 2.2, as noticed,
gives option to the living spouse of deceased
government servant to nominate son or unmarried
daughter. There is no condition imposed while
considering a son relating to marital status.
Adjective/condition of unmarried is affixed for the
daughter. This condition is without there being any
justification and; therefore, arbitrary and discriminatory
in nature.
9.    In view of above, now it is crystal clear that clause under which
claim of the petitioner has been considered and denied on the ground
that the petitioner is a sister and is not entitled to be appointed on
compassionate basis is without any justification and the same is
contrary to directions in the case of Madhubala Sinha (supra). As per
the finding with regard to the sister is concerned, in Madhubala Sinha
(supra), it is held that Clause 9.3.3 of NCWA, the brother of the
petitioner died unmarried, if fully dependent upon him, is also entitled
to be considered for appointment on compassionate ground. However,
this Court fails to fathom as to why the sister should be deprived of
such a benefit, whether married or unmarried. If it is treated that the
sister is not included as a dependent under Clause 9.3.3 of NCWA then
the same would amount to a clear case of gender bias which is against
the spirit of Article 14, 15, 16 and 39 (a) of the Constitution of India.
10.     Accordingly, petition is allowed. Impugned order dated
09/07/2021 (Annexure-P-1) is set aside. Clause 9.3.3 of NCWA is
declared to be unreasonable, unjustified and contrary to the view taken
in Madhubala Sinha (supra) and by the Full Bench in the case of
Meenakshi Dubey (supra), which would not come in way of the
petitioner for granting her compassionate appointment. The respondent-
department is, therefore, directed to consider the claim of the petitioner
afresh for grant of compassionate appointment ignoring the fact that in
view of Clause 9.3.3 of policy she is not entitled to get compassionate
appointment only because she being a sister. The aforesaid exercise be
completed by the authority within a period of three months from the
date of receipt of certified copy of this order and pass order
11.     In view of the aforesaid facts and circumstances there shall be no
order as to costs.
