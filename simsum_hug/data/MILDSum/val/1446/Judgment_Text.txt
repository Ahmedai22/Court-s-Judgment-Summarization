This Writ Petition has been filed by the petitioner under Article
226 of the Constitution of India seeking a Writ of Certiorari to quash
the impugned order of removal from service issued in Proceedings
No.P1/1(7)/2007-KLKY dt.12.03.2007 and the order of the 3rd
respondent issued in Proceeding No.PA/19(47).2008-RM-MBNR
dt.07.11.2008 served on 28.03.2011 in so far as not granting
continuity of service, attendant benefits and back wages and not
allowing the petitioner to discharge his duties when the petitioner
reported for duty before the 5th respondent on 31.03.2011 as arbitrary,
illegal, unjust and in violation of Articles 14, 16 and 21 of the
Constitution of India and consequently to direct the respondents’
Corporation to allow the petitioner to discharge his duties along with
continuity of service, attendant benefits and back wages in the interest
of justice and fair play.
2.     Brief facts leading to the filing of this Writ Petition are that the
petitioner joined respondent Corporation as a Driver in the year 1990.
On 01.01.1992, his services were regularised. The petitioner was
removed from service on 12.03.2007 on the ground of unauthorised
absence from 07.02.2007 to 12.02.2007 without any prior sanction of
W.P.No.19717 of 2011
leave from the departmental authorities and for not submitting any
sick certificate from RTC Hospital. The petitioner preferred an Appeal
before the Appellate Authority who rejected it and thereafter, the
petitioner preferred a Revision before the 3rd respondent who granted
relief to the petitioner vide order dt.07.11.2008 to the effect that the
petitioner should be reinstated into service as a fresh Driver. A copy
of the order of respondent No.3 was received by the petitioner on
28.03.2011 and thereafter the petitioner reported for duty on
31.03.2011 before the 5th respondent but the 5th respondent did not
allow him to join on the ground that the time granted in the order had
already expired. The petitioner submitted that he had received a copy
of the impugned order only on 28.03.2011 from the 3rd respondent and
therefore his joining report is also within time. However, he was not
allowed to join and discharge his duties. The petitioner preferred a
Review petition before the 3rd respondent. However, the same was
also held as time barred by the 3rd respondent who did not allow the
petitioner to join the service. Against such action of the respondents,
the petitioner has filed this Writ Petition. He submits that the reason
for his absence during the period 07.02.2007 to 12.02.2007, i.e., for a
period of five (5) days was due to his sickness and he also submitted
sick certificate from the RTC Hospital before the 4th respondent.
Therefore, his absence was due to reasonable and sufficient cause
only and there was no misconduct on his part requiring removal from
service. He further reiterated that the order of reinstatement was
W.P.No.19717 of 2011
received by him only on 28.03.2011 and thereafter he admittedly
reported for duty on 31.03.2011 and threfore, there is no delay on his
3.     When the matter came up for admission on 18.11.2011, this
Hon’ble Court was pleased to direct the respondents to consider
allowing the petitoner to join the duty and discharge his duties
pursuant to the proceedings dt.07.11.2008 issued by the 3rd
4.     Learned counsel for the petitioner, Sri V. Narasimha Goud,
submits that pursuant to the interim direction, the petitoner was
reinstated into service on 27.12.2011 and was being paid fresh basic
pay till he retired from service on 31.01.2015.
5.     The respondents have filed counter affidavit on 15.09.2011, i.e.,
prior to the interim direction and as far as the service of order of
reinstatement on the petitioner is concerned, at para 8 of the counter, it
is stated that the order was sent to the house address of the petitioner,
but it was returned by postal authorities and the address given in the
Writ Petition and the address to which the proceedings of the 3rd
respondent are sent are one and the same. It is submitted that the
petitioner had approached the 3rd respondent on 28.03.2011, i.e., after
a gap of 2 years 8 months by which time the order was not alive.
W.P.No.19717 of 2011
6.       In view of the same, it is clear that the order copy was not
served on the petitioner as it was returned unserved by the postal
authorities and the reason for non-service of the order is not
mentioned in the counter filed by the petitioner. But the fact remains
that the petitioner was not aware of the order of reinstatement and
thereafter upon receiving the order, the petitoner immediately
approached the authorities for joining and discharging his duties in
accordance with law. Further, it is also seen that the period of sickness
from 07.02.2007 to 12.02.2007 was only 5 days and the petitioner had
also submitted sick certificate. It is clearly not a case of misconduct
but only unauthorised leave.
7.       Learned counsel for the petitioner has relied upon the following
1. Vijay Singh Vs. State of Uttar Pradesh and others1
2. Chhel Singh Vs. MGB Gramin Bank, Pali and others2
3. Union of India (UOI) and others Vs. Giriraj Sharma3
4. G.N. Prasad Vs. A.P.S.R.T.C. and others4
5. D. Yadagiri Vs. APSRTC rep. By its Managind Director,
W.A.No.1126 of 2009 dt.12.11.2009 of AP High Court
W.P.No.19717 of 2011
The said decisions are also to the effect that the punishment of
removal from service for the charges of unauthorised absence is very
8.     Taking the contentions of the petitoner as well as the facts and
circusmtances of the case and the above judgments into account, the
action of the respondents in not permitting the petitioner to join duty
on 31.03.2011 on the ground of delay without actually serving the
order of reinstatement of the petitioner, is bad in law. Therefore, the
petitioner has to be directed to be reinstated. However, it is noticed
that the petitioner was reinstated on 27.12.2011 pursuant to the
interim order and retired from service on 31.01.2015 and therefore
directing reinstatement of the petitioner into service would be futile.
9.     Therfore, the respondents are directed to pay 50% of the back
wages for the period of removal from service to the date of
reinstatement into service. The petitioner shall also be granted
continuity of service only for the purpose of payment of retirement
benefits. As it is stated by the learned counsel for the pettioner that
due to pendency of the Writ Petition, the petitioner has not been paid
his retirement benefits, the respondents are directed to settle the
retirement benefits within a period of 60 days from the date of receipt
of a copy of this order.
10.    The Writ Petition is accordingly partly allowed. No order as to
11.    Pending miscellaneous petitions, if any, in this Writ Petition
shall stand closed.
