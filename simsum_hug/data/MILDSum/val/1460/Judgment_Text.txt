1.     This petition challenges the impugned order dated 02.09.2021
passed by the learned Trial Court in case FIR No.207/2016 registered at
police station Tilak Marg titled State vs Dinesh Chand Sharma whereby
an application of the petitioner under Section 311 Criminal Procedure
Code (hereinafter referred as Cr P C) was dismissed.
2.    It is the submission of the learned senior counsel for the petitioner
that PW38 Mr.Amit Roy, DCP is an important witness in the present
matter and the erstwhile learned counsel Mr.Siddharth Kashyap had
chosen not to cross examine the said witness despite an opportunity being
granted to him; but thereafter new counsel was appointed and after going
through the record, he was of the view cross examination of PW38 is
necessary, hence an application under Section 311 Cr P C was filed.
Such application of the petitioner was dismissed by the learned Trial
“Accused Sushil Ansal had been facing this trial for long.
He had been represented by his counsel Sh. Siddhartha
Kashyap till a new counsel had taken charge just recently
at the time when final arguments are being addressed on
behalf of the prosecution. It is pertinent to note that Sh.
Siddhartha Kashyap is still his counsel as he is appearing
for him along with the new counsel. Due opportunity to
cross examine PW~38 was afforded to accused Sushil
Ansal and a conscious decision was taken on his behalf to
not to cross examine PW-38. The plea on behalf of the
accused that he is entitled to a full opportunity to defend
himself and accordingly seek further permission to cross
examine PW-38 is baseless in view of the fact that the said
full opportunity has already been granted to accused and
availed by him. The plea of the applicant that the matter is
pending for a considerable period of time and accused
could not contemplate and consider that the matter require
affirmative and positive cross examination of PW-38
appears to be baseless as pendency of matter for long
rather provides ample time and opportunity to mull over
the issue and take appropriate action.
The plea of the applicant that no prejudice would be caused
to the prosecution is fallacious as affording further
opportunity despite availing the same would. cause delay
and thereby defeating the ends of justice. In judgement Shiv
Kumar Yadav Vs GNCT (2016) 2 SCC 402, it was held by
"15 .... While advancement of justice remains
understood that recall can be allowed for the
asking or reasons related to mere convenience.
It has normally to be presumed that the counsel
particularly when a counsel is appointed by
choice of a litigant. Taken to its logical end,
the principle that a retrial must follow on every
consequences on conduct of trials and the
criminal justice system. The witnesses cannot
be expected to face the hardship of appearing
in the court repeatedly, particularly in sensitive
cases such as the present one. It can result in
undue hardship for the victims, especially so,
of heinous crimes, if they are required to
repeatedly appear in court to face cross
The change of counsel and the decision of the new counsel
to cross examine any witness who was not cross examined
by the previous counsel is no ground to exercise power u/s
311. CrPC for recalling the witness where due opportunity
was afforded earlier.
Lastly this is a criminal trial and not a game where, if one
party was afforded any opportunity for recalling any
witness for valid reasons, the other party would ask for
chance as a matter of right without any reason.
Accordingly, considering the totality of the circumstances,
this court is not inclined to exercise power u/s 311 CrPC to
recall PW~38 as no justifiable grounds exists for the same.
Application is accordingly dismissed.”
3.      It is the submission of the learned senior counsel for the petitioner
initially the charge sheet was filed against Dinesh Chand Sharma, the
Ahlmad of the Court against whom there were allegations of tempering
and missing of the Court record, but later on supplementary charge sheets
was filed. The second supplementary charge sheet was filed by DCP
Amit Roy (PW38) but the petitioner was never arrayed as an accused by
him and it was only in third supplementary charge sheet prepared and
filed by Inspector R.S. Chauhan, the petitioner herein was summoned as
an accused. Investigating Officer Inspector R S Chauhan who had charge
sheeted the petitioner has since expired, hence it is argued PW38 is the
only Investigating Officer, who needs to be cross examined as to the
seizure of such tempered documents and qua conspiracy.                      It is also
submitted if the petitioner is allowed to cross examine PW38, it shall not
cause any prejudice to the prosecution. It is further argued PW38 is a
material witness as various documents relating to the petitioner were
seized by him and even otherwise it is the duty casted upon the Court to
safeguard the accused and allow him to examine and cross-examine the
witnesses per Section 165 of the Indian Evidence Act.                     It is also
submitted petitioner is 84 years of age and could not properly
comprehend as to if the cross examination of PW38 was essential for the
just decision of the case.
4.     To buttress his arguments, the learned senior counsel for the
petitioner has referred to Rajaram Prasad Yadav vs State of Bihar (2013)
14 SCC 461 which relates to the power of the Court under Section 311 Cr
“17. From a conspectus consideration of the above
decisions, while dealing with an application under Section
311 Cr.P.C. read along with Section 138 of the Evidence
Act, we feel the following principles will have to be borne
17.1 Whether the Court is right in thinking that the new
evidence is needed by it? Whether the evidence sought to be
led in under Section 311 is noted by the Court for a just
17.3 If evidence of any witness appears to the Court to be
essential to the just decision of the case, it is the power of
the Court to summon and examine or recall and re-examine
any such person.
17.4 The exercise of power under Section 311 Cr.P.C.
should be resorted to only with the object of finding out the
truth or obtaining proper proof for such facts, which will
lead to a just and correct decision of the case.
17.5 to 17.14 xxx”
5.     It is thus argued the petitioner need an opportunity of only a day
to cross examine PW38 so that entire facts be brought before the Court
for just decision of the case. It is submitted there are charges of
conspiracy against the petitioner besides other offence and he needs to
rebut such charges by cross examining this witness.
6.     The learned senior counsel for the petitioner has referred to an
order dated 16.03.2021 in Anoop Singh vs State Crl.M.C.No.865/2021
wherein this Court had sustained the order dated 06.03.2021 passed by
the learned Chief Metropolitan Magistrate, Patiala House Courts, Delhi
in the present FIR allowing an application under Section 311 Cr P C to
put certain documents, being formal in nature, to PW39.           Hence, it is
argued such an order be also passed in this petition too; moreso when
admittedly PW39 was never cross examined on behalf of the petitioner
by his earlier learned counsel.
7.     The learned senior counsel for the State submitted the argument of
the petitioner is nothing but a ploy to further delay the matter. He argued
PW38 was examined in detail and his examination rather continued for
15 months running into 27 pages. He was cross examined by each
accused except the present petitioner, to whom also an opportunity was
granted, but his learned counsel Mr.Siddharth Kashyap made a conscious
decision by choosing not to cross examine PW38.
8.     Looking on the aspect of delay I may say though the present FIR
was registered in the year 2006, yet the petitioner was summoned on
15.02.2008 on filing of 3rd supplementary chargesheet, which order dated
15.02.2008 was though challenged, but his revision petition was
dismissed on 03.09.2009. The matter was then listed for framing of
charge yet it could not be framed till the year 2014. Yet again revision
was filed against charge but on 12.05.2017 such revision petition was
also dismissed. On 05.03.2018 in W.P.(Crl) No.243/2018 a direction
was rather issued to the learned Trial Court for expeditious trial and to
pronounce the judgment by 30.11.2018. Admittedly, it was not done. Yet
again on 04.12.2018 another direction was issued in that very petition to
fix three dates of hearing per week and to conduct the trial in a time-
bound manner.        Per order dated 06.02.2020 passed by this Court in
WP(Crl) No.243/2018 the matter is being monitored by this Court. In the
light of above facts, we need to see the intention to file such application
under Section 311 Cr P C at a deeply belated stage.
9.     Some more dates are relevant. Admittedly, the prosecution
evidence was closed on 06.04.2021. Defence evidence was closed on
25.08.2021; and final arguments started w.e.f. 27.08.2021.             The
prosecution argued the matter on 27.08.2021, 31.08.2021, 02.09.2021
and 03.09.2021 and thereafter the defence arguments of accused namely
Dinesh Chand Sharma and other two accused started on 04.09.2021,
06.09.2021, 07.09.2021 and 08.09.2021 and matter is still being argued.
It was when the final arguments had started, this application was moved.
10.    To appreciate the concern of the petitioner, one needs to see as to
what is the cause for the petitioner to move this application under Section
311 Cr P C. The petitioner has filed an application to cross-examine the
Investigating Officer on specific allegations of conspiracy by putting
certain suggestions and to bring his attention to various material in the
forms of statements under Section 161 Cr PC recorded by the main
Investigating Officer and towards various necessary documents to be
collected or deliberately omitted from being placed on record.
11.    Needless to say, the power under Section 311 Cr PC is to be
exercised for strong and valid reasons. One cannot claim any parity in
deciding of an application under Section 311 Cr PC, hence order dated
16.03.2021 of this court in Crl.M.C.865/2021 is of no use to the
petitioner herein.      Even otherwise Crl.M.C.865/2021 notes the said
application under Section 311 Cr PC. was moved when the prosecution
evidence was still going on and it was admittedly prior to closure of
prosecution evidence, but, whereas the present application is filed when
final arguments had started. It was at this stage, a new counsel was
appointed in the matter and he thought of cross-examining the
Investigating Officer PW38 by putting him certain suggestions, hence
prayer to recall him.
12.     Admittedly, PW38 on the basis of documents filed/seized by him
never considered the petitioner an accused and probably of this reason,
the erstwhile counsel did not prefer to cross examine him. It appeared to
be a conscious decision of the learned counsel for the petitioner,
considering the nature of evidence against him. Not to repeat, his counsel
Mr.Siddharth Kashyap did not cross examine as many as 18 witnesses
viz., he rather adopted the cross examination by other counsels qua PW7,
PW30 and PW32 and preferred not to cross examine PW3, PW4, PW5,
PW39 and PW40. Thus, to recall PW38 to put suggestions to him as his
earlier learned counsel failed to do so cannot be considered a valid
ground for exercise of discretion under Section 311 Cr P C, especially, in
the wake of delay referred to above. Further no necessary documents as
alleged in para 10 above were brought in defence evidence either by the
petitioner.
13.     In State (NCT of Delhi) vs Shiv Kumar Yadav & Another (2016)2
“11. It is further well settled that fairness of trial has to be
seen not only from the point of view of the accused, but also
from the point of view of the victim and the society. In the
name of fair trial, the system cannot be held to ransom. The
accused is entitled to be represented by a counsel of his
choice, to be provided all relevant documents, to cross-
examine the prosecution witnesses and to lead evidence in
his defence. The object of provision for recall is to reserve
the power with the court to prevent any injustice in the
conduct of the trial at any stage. The power available with
the court to prevent injustice has to be exercised only if the
court, for valid reasons, feels that injustice is caused to a
party. Such a finding, with reasons, must be specifically
recorded by the court e before the power is exercised. It is
not possible to lay down precise situations when such
power can be exercised. The legislature in its wisdom has
left the power undefined. Thus, the scope of the power has
to be considered from case to case. The guidance for the
purpose is available in several decisions relied upon by the
parties. It will be sufficient to refer to only some of the
decisions for the principles laid down which are relevant
for this case.”
14.     In State of Haryana vs Ram Mehar (2016) 8 SCC 136 the Court
“40. In the case at hand, the prosecution had examined all
the witnesses. The statements of all the accused persons,
that is 148 in number, had been recorded under Section
313 CrPC. The defence had examined 15 witnesses. The
foundation for recall, as is evincible from the applications
filed, does not even remotely make out a case that such
recalling is necessary for just decision of the case or to
arrive at the truth. The singular ground which prominently
comes to surface is that the earlier counsel who was
engaged by the defence had not put some questions and
failed to put some questions and give certain suggestions. It
has come on record that number of lawyers were engaged
by the defence. The accused persons had engaged counsel
of their choice. In such a situation recalling of witnesses
indubitably cannot form the foundation. If it is accepted as
a ground, there would be possibility of a retrial. There may
be an occasion when such a ground may weigh with the
court, but definitely the instant case does not arouse the
judicial conscience within the established norms of Section
311 CrPC for exercise of such jurisdiction.
42. At this juncture, we think it apt to state that the exercise
of power under Section 311 CrPC can be sought to be
invoked either by the prosecution or by the accused persons
or by the Court itself. The High Court has been moved by
the ground that the accused persons are in the custody and
the concept of speedy trial is not nullified and no prejudice
is caused, and, therefore, the principle of magnanimity
should apply. Suffice it to say, a criminal trial does not
singularly centres around the accused. In it there is
involvement of the prosecution, the victim and the victim
represents the collective. The cry of the collective may not
be uttered in decibels which is physically audible in the
court premises, but the Court has to remain sensitive to
such silent cries and the agonies, for the society seeks
justice. Therefore, a balance has to be struck. xxx Hence,
we reiterate the necessity of doctrine of balance.”
15.    In Girish vs State of UP 2020 SCC OnLine All 1063 and in
Veerendradas Bairagi vs Shreekant Bairagi 2019 SCC OnLine MP 7006
the Court held the subsequently engaged counsel cannot seek one more
opportunity as a matter of right to further delay the matters. Rather the
“9. In the present case, it appears from the application
filed under section 311, Cr.P.C. that request for re-
examination has been made solely on the ground that
Senior Counsel has been engaged in place of a Junior
Counsel as the Junior Counsel, according to the petitioner,
has not conducted the cross-examination of witnesses in an
effective manner. However, in the light of the legal
position, as discussed above, it is certainly not within the
scope of section 311 Cr.P.C. to countenance such a prayer.
No illegality or perversity has been committed by the trial
Court in passing the impugned order.”
16.    Thus the consistent view of this Court is a mere change of counsel
would not suffice to recall witness to put certain suggestions in the
manner, the new counsel desires. The petitioner had engaged earlier
counsel of his choice. He made a decision not to cross-examine, not one
but 18 witnesses, probably, because the petitioner is facing charge of
conspiracy only, and hence such decision viz not to cross-examine 18
witnesses cannot be said to an inadvertent act but may be a part of his
strategy. Since considerable delay has taken place, the plight of victim,
also cannot be ignored. The petition being devoid of merits is thus
dismissed. Pending application, if any, also stands disposed of.
