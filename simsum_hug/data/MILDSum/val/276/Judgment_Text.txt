In the present writ petition, the prayer of the petitioner is that
the daily wage service, which the petitioner had rendered with the
respondent-Nigam starting from 23.09.1979 till his services were
regularized i.e. 17.10.1990 should be taken into account as qualifying
service for computing his pensionary benefits.
As per the averments made in the petition, the petitioner
initially joined the respondent-Nigam on 23.09.1979. While the petitioner
was working, his services were terminated on 20.05.1982 and the said
termination was challenged by the petitioner before the Industrial Tribunal
and vide Award dated 24.10.1986, termination of the services of the
petitioner was held to be bad and the petitioner was reinstated in service
with all back wages. In pursuance to the said award, the petitioner was
reinstated in service and ultimately his services were regularized by the
respondent-Nigam on 17.10.1990. On 20.09.1992, the petitioner was
promoted as Assistant Line Man and, thereafter, on 04.03.2010 as Line Man
from which post he retired on attaining the age of superannuation on
Learned counsel for the petitioner argues that once the
petitioner had rendered daily wage services starting from 23.09.1979, which
services were ultimately regularized by the respondent-Nigam on
17.10.1990, the same needs to be taken into account as a qualifying service
for computing the pensionary benefits of the petitioner, keeping in view the
Rule 3.17 of the Punjab Civil Services Rules, 1970, which have duly been
adopted by the respondent-Nigam for regularizing the employees.
After notice of motion, the respondent-Nigam have filed reply,
wherein, it has been stated that the petitioner had only informed the
department that he remained engaged as a daily wager from 23.09.1981 to
14.06.1987 and now the claim of the petitioner is from the year 1979, which
is incorrect. Learned counsel for the respondent-Nigam submits that there is
no record with the respondents to show that petitioner was ever appointed in
the year 1979 and he worked on daily wage basis. Learned counsel for the
respondent-Nigam further submits that the respondent-Nigam is admitting
the claim of the petitioner starting from the year 1987 onwards till the
regularization of his services on 17.10.1990.
I have heard learned counsel for the parties and have gone
through the record with their able assistance.
Learned counsel for the petitioner argues that in the present
case, the petitioner had rendered services on daily wage basis starting from
23.09.1979 onwards till 17.10.1990. Though, in the reply, the respondents
are disputing    the same but, the document including the award of the
competent Court of law, which has been placed on record to show that in
fact the petitioner was appointed on 23.09.1979 and his services were
terminated in 1982, which termination was held to be bad by the Labour
Court    vide Award dated 24.10.1986. In the said award, the date of
appointment of the petitioner has duly been mentioned as 23.09.1979. That
being so, the dispute about the period of daily wage service of the petitioner
being raised by the respondent-Nigam cannot be accepted.
Further, by an award of the Industrial Tribunal, Haryana dated
24.10.1986, the petitioner was reinstated in service with back wages,
meaning thereby, the petitioner had continuity in service and, therefore the
petitioner is entitled for the benefit of counting his daily wage service
starting from 23.09.1979 till 17.10.1990 as qualifying service for computing
his pensionary benefits.
There is no dispute that the Punjab Civil Services Rules, 1970
have been adopted by the respondent-Nigam and according to Rule 3.17 of
the said rules, daily wage services rendered by an employee prior to his/her
regularization is to be treated as qualifying service for computing his/her
pensionary benefits.
Not only as per the rule governing the service but, as per the
settled principle of law settled by the Full Bench of this Court in CWP-
2864-1983 titled as Kesar Chand vs. State of Punjab through The
Secretary P.W.D B & R Chandigarh and others decided on 02.06.1988,
daily wage service rendered by an employee is to be taken into account as a
qualifying service for computing his pensionary benefits.
Nothing has been placed on record by the learned counsel for
the respondent-Nigam to controvert the settled principle of law settled by
the Full Bench of this Court in Kesar Chand's case (Supra).
Keeping in view the above, prayer of the petitioner is allowed.
Respondent-Nigam is directed to compute the pensionary benefits of the
petitioner afresh after taking into account the daily wage service rendered
by the petitioner from September, 1979 onwards till the date his services
were regularized as well and grant him the benefit of arrears as well.
The question which arises before this Court for consideration is
whether the petitioner will also be entitled for interest on the said arrears or
In the present case, law was very much settled when the
petitioner retired from service and the same should have been applied by the
respondents themselves rather than creating dispute on facts and law.
Respondents have forced the petitioner to approach this Court so as to get
the benefit for which, he was entitled for, even on the date when he retired
from service i.e. 30.04.2016 not only as per the rules governing the service
but, as per the settled principle of law also. Hence, the petitioner needs to be
compensated for the same. The arrears which will be recomputed now will
also carry interest @ 6% per annum from the date the petitioner retired till
the actual payment will be released.
Let computation under this order be done within a period of
two months from the date of receipt of copy of this order and the amount so
calculated shall be paid to the petitioner within a period of four weeks
The writ petition is allowed in above terms.
