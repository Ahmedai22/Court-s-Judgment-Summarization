 Supreme Court today has ordered the release of an alleged Lashkar-e-Taiba Member incarcerated since 2006 in Kalaburgi jail in a case related to recovery of a pistol and two hand grenades.
The order was passed in an appeal filed by one Abdul Raheman who is said to have undergone a sentence of more than 15 years. 
Allegedly a member of banned terrorist organisation Lashkar-e-Taiba, the appellant was convicted by the Trial Court for offences punishable under Sections 121,122, 124-A of IPC and sentenced to undergo life imprisonment with fine of Rs. 25,000/-. 
He was further convicted under Section 25 of the Arms Act, 1959 and sentenced to five years with fine of Rs.25,000/-, under Section 4 of the Explosives Act and sentenced to life imprisonment with fine of Rs.25,000/- and under Section 5 of the Explosive Substances Act and sentenced to life imprisonment with fine of Rs.25,000/-.
A Bench of Justices L. Nageswara Rao, B.R. Gavai and B.V. Nagarathna noted that while the High Court had partly allowed the appeal filed by the instant appellant and acquitted him under Sections 121, 122 and 124-A IPC, it had upheld the conviction and sentence under the other provisions. 
Noting that the appellant had already been imprisoned for a considerable amount of time, the Bench was of the considered view that the sentence should be converted to the period already undergone. 
"The appellant is, accordingly, directed to be released forthwith", it said.
Senior Advocate Sidharth Dave appeared for the appellant and Counsel Shubhranshu Padhi, appeared for the State of Karnataka.
Cause Title: Abdul Raheman v State of Karnataka
