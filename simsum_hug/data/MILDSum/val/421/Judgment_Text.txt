Habeas Corpus Petition has been filed under Article 226 of
Constitution of India seeking for an issue of a Writ of Habeas Corpus
directing the 9th respondent namely, the Commissioner of Police, Chennai
City, Tamil Nadu to secure the minor sons respondents 2 and 3 from the
illegal custody of the respondents 1, 4 and 5 and to produce the bodies of the
respondents 2 and 3 before this Court and hand over the custody of the said
minor childrens to, so that the respondents 2 and 3 can be taken to the United
States of America where they were living and studying in school since they
are the citizens of the said country.
For Respondents : Mr.M.Muthappan for R1 to R5
“The Child is father of the Man” is a famous quote from William
§Wordsworth’s poem “My Heart Leaps Up”. The popular understanding of
this phrase is that the behaviour and activities of a person’s childhood go a
long way in building his personality. Children used to be enchanted with the
joys of childhood and those thoughts evoke nostalgia when the child becomes
a man. For Wordsworth, a rainbow in the sky made his heart leap. Alas, gone
are the days when children used to enjoy their childhood and they are now
helplessly made to witness the fight between their father and mother, because
of their petty egos and it is painful to notice that in most of those fights, it is
the children who are used as a pawn. The mental health of such a child takes
a beating and how such a child is going to grow into a man and manage
relationships, is a million dollar question. We were constrained to start this
judgment with such a poignant note since we encounter two or three such
cases on a daily basis while dealing with Habeas Corpus Petitions. This is yet
another case which falls under this category and we have to deal with it
keeping in mind the best interest of the children involved in this case.
2. The father of                     and           , twin boys, has
knocked the doors of this Court seeking for handing over the custody of the
children and to take them back to the United States of America(USA) in order
to continue their living and education at USA.
3. The brief facts of the case are as under:
3.1. The petitioner got married to                 (1st respondent
herein) on 21.04.1999 according to Hindu rites and customs. Even before
marriage, the petitioner and the 1st respondent were citizens of USA and
naturally, both of them left India after 10 days of their marriage and started
their matrimonial life in Virginia. Through the marriage, the twin boys were
born on 16.04.2008 and they also acquired American citizenship by birth.
3.2. The children were raised and educated in USA and this continued
till December 2020. The children came along with their mother to India on
27.12.2020 to meet their grandparents and to stay with them. By then, there
was friction in the relationship between the petitioner and the 1st respondent.
3.3. The grievance of the petitioner is that the stay of the children in
India was extended from time to time upto May 2021. Even thereafter, the 1st
respondent was not returning back to USA. As a first step, the petitioner
caused a legal notice on 23.09.2021 calling upon the 1st respondent to return
back to USA along with the children. The 1st respondent issued a reply notice
dated 22.10.2021, which mostly gave her justification to stay away from the
petitioner, in India. The reconciliation process did not fructify and ultimately,
an action was initiated by the petitioner during October 2021 for divorce and
custody of the children before the appropriate Court at Virginia. The 1st
respondent submitted herself to the jurisdiction of the said Court and moved a
motion to transfer the jurisdiction from Virginia and this motion was denied
by the Circuit Court of Fairfax County through order dated 27.01.2022 and
the matter was set for trial for the custody of the children.
3.4. The 1st respondent moved O.P.No.719 of 2021 before this
Court seeking for the relief of permanent custody of the minor children. The
petitioner filed a petition in Application No.384 of 2022 seeking for the
rejection of the petition and this Court by an order dated 21.03.2022 rejected
the petition in O.P.No.719 of 2021 and gave liberty to the 1st respondent to
work out her remedy before the Circuit Court of Fairfax County, USA. The 1 st
respondent, aggrieved by the same, filed O.S.A.No.102 of 2022 and this
Appeal was dismissed as withdrawn on 12.07.2022.
3.5. The petition that was moved by the petitioner was taken up by
the Circuit Court and an order was passed on 21.07.2022, giving the sole
custody of the children to the petitioner and directing the 1st respondent to
handover the children on or before 12.08.2022. The 1st respondent moved an
Application to suspend the order passed on 21.07.2022 and accordingly, a
suspension order was passed on 29.07.2022. Ultimately, a final order was
passed on 18.10.2022 lifting the suspension order dated 29.07.2022 and
thereby, the earlier order that was passed on 21.07.2022 was restored. The
trial for the divorce and equity distribution was scheduled to 4th and 5th of
3.6. In the meantime, the 1st respondent enrolled the children with
an online High School and the education of the children was continued
through online mode and the children are now stay put with the 1st respondent
in India. Parallelly, the 1st respondent started initiating various proceedings
against the petitioner viz. O.P.No.2788 of 2022 seeking for the relief of
restitution of conjugal rights before the 2nd Additional Family Court, Chennai,
proceedings under the Domestic Violence Act in D.V.C.No.116 of 2022
before the Additional Mahila Court, Egmore and it was also brought to our
notice that a criminal complaint has been given against the petitioner and his
family members for alleged offence under Section 498A of IPC. Thus, the 1st
respondent has paved way for further complications in an already tumultuous
relationship prevailing between the petitioner and the 1st respondent.
3.7. It is under these circumstances, the Habeas Corpus Petition
came up for hearing before us and we heard Mr.G.Rajagopalan, learned
Senior Counsel for the petitioner, Mr.M.Muthappan, learned counsel for R1
to R5 and R.Muniyapparaj, learned Additional Public Prosecutor for R9. We
carefully considered the submissions made on either side and the materials
placed before us.
4. At the outset, this Court has to make it abundantly clear that the
dispute between the petitioner and the 1st respondent will not be gone into and
we will focus our attention only on those facts which directly concern the best
interests of the children.
5. There is no dispute with regard to the fact that the petitioner, the 1 st
respondent and the children are American citizens. There is also no dispute
with regard to the fact that the parties concerned are Overseas Citizen of
India (OCI) card holders. The OCI card is more in the nature of a long time
visa and it does not confer any domiciliary right to the card holder and the
card holder for all purposes is considered to be a foreigner as envisaged under
the Foreigners Act, 1946. We must also bear in mind that this Court must give
due regard to the order passed by the Circuit Court of Fairfax County and the
implementation of the same.
6. Before we go into the essential facts to decide on the relief sought
for by the petitioner, it will be more appropriate to take note of the legal
position with regard to the jurisdiction of this Court to entertain this petition
and the manner in which the interest of the children must be determined,
considering the fact that they are American citizens.
7. The co-ordinate Bench of this Court (in which one of us Justice
P.N.Prakash was a party) dealt with a very similar issue in H.C.P.No.654 of
2021 in the case of Girish Arunagiri v. Mahalakshmi Senthil Nathan and Others.
The relevant portions in the judgment are extracted hereunder:
“14. The preliminary question is whether a habeas corpus
petition is maintainable to secure the custody of the two children and
direct their return to the United States. We find that this issue is no
longer res integra, and is settled by a decision of the Supreme Court in
Yashita Sahu (supra), wherein, it is observed thus:
“10. It is too late in the day to urge that a writ of habeas
corpus is not maintainable if the child is in the custody of another
parent. The law in this regard has developed a lot over a period of time
but now it is a settled position that the court can invoke its
extraordinary writ jurisdiction for the best interest of the child. This has
been done in Elizabeth Dinshaw v. Arvand M. Dinshaw [Elizabeth
Dinshaw v. Arvand M. Dinshaw, (1987) 1 SCC 42 : 1987 SCC (Cri) 13]
, Nithya Anand Raghavan v. State (NCT of Delhi) [Nithya Anand
Raghavan v. State (NCT of Delhi), (2017) 8 SCC 454:(2017) 4 SCC
(Civ) 104] and Lahari Sakhamuri v. Sobhan Kodali [Lahari Sakhamuri v.
Sobhan Kodali, 2019) 7 SCC 311 : (2019) 3 SCC (Civ) 590] among
others. In all these cases, the writ petitions were entertained.
Therefore, we reject the contention of the appellant wife that the writ
petition before the High Court of Rajasthan was not maintainable.”
15. We also notice that the basis of our jurisdiction under Article
226 of the Constitution of India, in a case of this nature, is essentially
predicated on the best interests of the children. We have, therefore,
consciously refrained from being sidetracked into the matrimonial
allegations levelled by the spouses against each other in their
respective affidavit and counter affidavit.
16. In cases of child custody, the jurisdiction of the Court is
essentially parens patriae. The welfare and best interests of the
children must be the pre- dominant consideration. In Elizabeth
Dinshaw (supra), the Supreme Court has observed as under:
“Whenever a question arises before a court pertaining to
the custody of a minor child, the matter is to be decided not on
considerations of the legal rights of parties but on the sole and
predominant criterion of what would best serve the interest and welfare
of the minor.”
When a writ of habeas corpus is sought to direct the
return of a child to another country, the Court would also examine
which of the two Courts (the domestic or foreign) would have the most
intimate connect with the minor for the purposes of securing the child’s
safety and well-being. In Surinder Kaur Sandhu vs. Harbax Singh
Sandhu [(1984) 3 SCC 698], the Supreme Court dealt with an identical
case of spouses who had set up their matrimonial home in England.
Their child was a British citizen. The Court, speaking through Chief
Justice Y.V.Chandrachud, opined thus:
“Ordinarily, jurisdiction must follow upon functional lines. That is to
say, for example, that in matters relating to matrimony and custody, the
law of that place must govern which has the closest concern with the
well-being of the spouses and the welfare of the offsprings of marriage.
The spouses in this case had made England their home where this boy
was born to them. The father cannot deprive the English Court of its
jurisdiction to decide upon his custody by removing him to India, not in
the normal movement of the matrimonial home but, by an act which
was gravely detrimental to the peace of that home. The fact that the
matrimonial home of the spouses was in England, establishes sufficient
contacts or ties with that State in order to make it reasonable and just
for the courts of that State to assume jurisdiction to enforce obligations
which were incurred therein by the spouses.”
(emphasis supplied by us)
17. Keeping in mind the best interests of the minor children and
the “most intimate connect” principle, the line of enquiry in a case of
this nature has been set out by the Supreme Court in V. Ravi
Chandran (Dr.) (2) vs. Union of India and others [(2010) 1 SCC
174], in the following passage:
“29. While dealing with a case of custody of a child removed
by a parent from one country to another in contravention of the orders
of the court where the parties had set up their matrimonial home, the
court in the country to which the child has been removed must first
consider the question whether the court could conduct an elaborate
enquiry on the question of custody or by dealing with the matter
summarily order a parent to return custody of the child to the country
from which the child was removed and all aspects relating to the child's
welfare be investigated in a court in his own country. Should the court
take a view that an elaborate enquiry is necessary, obviously the court
is bound to consider the welfare and happiness of the child as the
paramount consideration and go into all relevant aspects of welfare of
the child including stability and security, loving and understanding care
and guidance and full development of the child's character, personality
and talents. While doing so, the order of a foreign court as to his
custody may be given due weight; the weight and persuasive effect of a
foreign judgment must depend on the circumstances of each case.
30. However, in a case where the court decides to exercise
its jurisdiction summarily to return the child to his own country, keeping
in view the jurisdiction of the court in the native country which has the
closest concern and the most intimate contact with the issues arising in
the case, the court may leave the aspects relating to the welfare of the
child to be investigated by the court in his own native country as that
could be in the best interests of the child. The indication given in
McKee v. McKee [1951 AC 352 : (1951) 1 All ER 942 (PC)] that there
may be cases in which it is proper for a court in one jurisdiction to
make an order directing that a child be returned to a foreign jurisdiction
without investigating the merits of the dispute relating to the care of the
child on the ground that such an order is in the best interests of the
child has been explained in L (Minors), In re [(1974) 1 WLR 250 :
(1974) 1 All ER 913 (CA)] and the said view has been approved by this
Court in Dhanwanti Joshi [(1998) 1 SCC 112] . Similar view taken by
the Court of Appeal in H. (Infants), In re[(1966) 1 WLR 381 (Ch & CA) :
(1966) 1 All ER 886 (CA)] has been approved by this Court in Elizabeth
18. To complete the picture, we also notice a mild
jurisprudential shift in Nithya Anand Raghavan (supra) and Kanika
Goel v. State (NCT of Delhi) [(2018) 9 SCC 578], wherein, it was held
that the doctrine of “intimate and closest concern” are merely of
persuasive relevance when the child is uprooted from its native country
and taken to a place to encounter alien environment, language, custom,
etc. with the portent of mutilative bearing on the process of its overall
growth and grooming; the adjudicative mission in such cases has the
obligation to secure the unreserved welfare of the child as the
paramount consideration. These principles have been cited and
reiterated in Lahari Sakhamuri (supra). In its recent decision in
Nilanjan Bhattacharya vs. State of Karnataka [2021 SCC Online SC
928], the Supreme Court opined that where a child has been removed
from its native country to India, it would be in the best interests of the
child to return to its native country if the child has not developed roots
in India and no harm would be caused to the child on such return. It
was held that where one parent had acted with sufficient promptitude,
the Court is only required to conduct a summary inquiry to ascertain
whether there is any harm if the child returns to the United States,
where he was born and has been brought up. The Court is required to
engage in an elaborate inquiry on the merits of the case, only if a
considerable time has passed since the child has been removed and if
the child has developed roots in India. In either event, the primary
consideration of the Court is to ascertain the welfare of the child.”
8. It will also be pertinent to take note of the recent judgment of the
Apex Court in Rohit Thammana Gowda v. State of Karnataka and Others in Civil
Appeal No.4987 of 2022, dated 29.07.2022. This judgment becomes very
relevant since the facts therein are very similar to the facts of the present
case. Hence, the relevant portions are extracted hereunder:
“8.At the outset we may state that in a matter involving
the question of custody of a child it has to be borne in mind that
the question ‘what is the wish/desire of the child’ is different and
distinct from the question ‘what would be in the best interest of
the child’. Certainly, the wish/desire of the child can be
ascertained through interaction but then, the question as to
‘what would be in the best interest of the child’ is a matter to be
decided by the court taking into account all the relevant
circumstances. When couples are at loggerheads and wanted
to part their ways as parthian shot they may level extreme
allegations against each other so as to depict the other
unworthy to have the custody of the child. In the circumstances,
we are of the view that for considering the claim for custody of a
minor child, unless very serious, proven conduct which should
make one of them unworthy to claim for custody of the child
concerned, the question can and shall be decided solely looking
into the question as to, ‘what would be the best interest of the
child concerned’. In other words, welfare of the child should be
the paramount consideration. In that view of the matter we think
it absolutely unnecessary to discuss and deal with all the
contentions and allegations in their respective pleadings and
affidavits.
9. To answer the stated question and also on the
question of jurisdiction we do not think it necessary to conduct a
deep survey on the authorities This Court in Nithya Anand
Raghawan v. State (NCT of Delhi) [(2017) 8 SCC 454],
reiterated the principle laid in V. Ravi Chandran v. Union of
India [(2010) 1 SCC 174] and further held thus:—
“In exercise of summary jurisdiction, the court must be
satisfied and of the opinion that the proceedings instituted before it
was in close proximity and filed promptly after the child was
removed from his/her native state and brought within its territorial
jurisdiction, the child has not gained roots here and further that
it will be in the child's welfare to return to his native
state because of the difference in language spoken or social
customs and contacts to which he/she has been accustomed or
such other tangible reasons. In such a case the court need not
resort to an elaborate inquiry into the merits of the paramount
welfare of the child but leave that inquiry to the foreign court by
directing return of the child. Be it noted that in exceptional cases
the court can still refuse to issue direction to return the child to
the native state and more particularly in spite of a pre-existing
order of the foreign court in that behalf, if it is satisfied that the
child's return may expose him to a grave risk of harm”.
10. In Ravi Chandran's case (supra), this Court took
note of the actual role of the High Courts in the matter of
examination of cases involving claim of custody of a minor
based on the principle of parens patriae jurisdiction considering
the fact that it is the minor who is within the jurisdiction of the
court. Based on such consideration it was held that even while
considering Habeas Corpus writ petition qua a minor, in a given
case, the High Courts may direct for return of the child or
decline to change the custody of the child taking into account
the attending facts and circumstances as also the settled legal
position. In Nitya Anand's case this Court had also referred to
the decision in Dhanwanti Joshi v. Madhav Unde [(1998) 1 SCC
112] which in turn was rendered after referring to the decision of
the Privy Council in Mckee v. Mckee [[1951] A.C. 352]. In
Mckee's case the Privy Council held that the order of the foreign
court would yield to the welfare and that the comity of courts
demanded not its enforcement, but its grave consideration.
Though, India is not a signatory to Hague Convention of 1980,
on the “Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction”, this
Court, virtually, imbibing the true spirit of the principle of parens
patriae jurisdiction, went on to hold in Nithya Anand Raghavan's
“40. … As regards the non-Convention countries, the
law is that the court in the country to which the child has been
removed must consider the question on merits bearing the welfare
of the child as of paramount importance and reckon the order of the
foreign court as only a factor to be taken into consideration, unless
the court thinks it fit to exercise summary jurisdiction in the interests
of the child and its prompt return is for its welfare. In exercise of
summary jurisdiction, the court must be satisfied and of the opinion
that the proceeding instituted before it was in close proximity and
filed promptly after the child was removed from his/her native state
and brought within its territorial jurisdiction, the child has not gained
roots here and further that it will be in the child's welfare to return to
his native state because of the difference in language spoken or
social customs and contacts to which he/she has been accustomed
or such other tangible reasons. In such a case the court need not
resort to an elaborate inquiry into the merits of the paramount
welfare of the child but leave that inquiry to the foreign court by
directing return of the child. Be it noted that in exceptional cases the
court can still refuse to issue direction to return the child to the
native state and more particularly in spite of a pre-existing order of
the foreign court in that behalf, if it is satisfied that the child's return
may expose him to a grave risk of harm. This means that the courts
in India, within whose jurisdiction the minor has been brought must
“ordinarily” consider the question on merits, bearing in mind the
welfare of the child as of paramount importance whilst reckoning the
preexisting order of the foreign court if any as only one of the factors
and not get fixated therewith. In either situation - be it a summary
inquiry or an elaborate inquiry - the welfare of the child is of
paramount consideration. Thus, while examining the issue the
courts in India are free to decline the relief of return of the child
brought within its jurisdiction, if it is satisfied that the child is now
settled in its new environment or if it would expose the child to
physical or psychological harm or otherwise place the child in an
intolerable position or if the child is quite mature an objects to its
return. We are in respectful agreement with the aforementioned
exposition.”
11. Having taken note of the position thus settled in the
said decisions we will now consider the question whether such
an exercise had been undertaken properly in this case. This is
because in this case foreign Court, as noted above, passed
orders for the return of the child to USA. There is nothing on
record to show that such an order passed on the second
occasion was also vacated subsequently. True that the first
order to that effect passed on 26.10.2020 was subsequently
vacated at the instance of the third respondent on 30.10.2020.
However, going by the records the subsequent order passed in
March 2021 Superior Court of Washington, County of King for
the return of the child owing to non-compliance led to further
order for contempt on 29.4.2021. The High Court, obviously,
observed that though the U.S Court subsequently suspended
the order of spousal support did not pass any order regarding
the custody of the child and hence, custody of the child is
continuing with respondent No. 3. We have referred to those
aspects solely for the purpose of pointing out that the High
Court was aware of the existence of order for the return of the
child by the US Court.
12. Be that as it may, we will now consider the question
whether consideration was bestowed by the High Court in the
matter in terms of the position settled by this Court in the
aforementioned       decisions   i.e.,  by   giving  predominant
importance to the welfare of the child. A scanning of the
impugned judgment would reveal that the High Court had rightly
identified the vital aspect that paramount consideration should
be given to the welfare of the child while considering the matter.
13. We have stated earlier that the question ‘what is the
wish/desire of the child’ can be ascertained through interaction,
but then, the question as to ‘what would be the best interest of
the child’ is a matter to be decided by the court taking into
account all the relevant circumstances. A careful scrutiny of the
impugned judgment would, however, reveal that even after
identifying the said question rightly the High Court had swayed
away from the said point and entered into consideration of
certain aspects not relevant for the said purpose. We will
explain the raison d'etre for the said remark.
14. The High Court, after taking note of the various
proceedings initiated by the appellant before the US Courts
formed an opinion that he had initiated such proceedings only
with an intention to enhance his chance of success in the
Habeas Corpus Writ Petition and to pre-empt any move by the
wife (respondent No. 3) for custody by approaching the Indian
Courts. In other words, the initiation of proceedings before the
US Court was motivated and definitely not in good faith and
was also not in the best interests of the son. In this context, it is
relevant to note that US Court concerned had, admittedly,
ordered for the return of the child and owing to the non-
compliance with the said order initiated action for contempt. The
spousal support order passed by the US Court was also
suspended for the reason of non-compliance with the order for
return of the child. When US Court was moved and the court
had passed orders the above mentioned observation can only
be regarded as one made at a premature stage and it was
absolutely uncalled for and it virtually affected the process of
consideration of the issue finally. When the US Court passed
such orders and not orders on the custody of the child it ought
not to have been taken as permission for respondent No. 3 to
keep the custody of the child. At any rate, after the order for
return of the child and orders for contempt such a plea of the
respondent No. 3 ought not to have been entertained.
15. Considering the fact that the marriage between the
appellant and respondent No. 3 was conducted in Bengaluru in
accordance with Hindu rites and ceremonies, the High Court
held that the US Courts got no jurisdiction to entertain any
dispute arising out of the marriage. This conclusion was arrived
at without taking into account the efficacy of the order passed
by the US Court. It was not strictly for the return of respondent
No. 3 but was an order intending to facilitate the return of a
naturalised citizen of America holding an American Passport.
Paragraph 85 of the impugned judgment would reveal that the
High Court had enquired about the desire and comfort of the
child with respect to his schooling and stay during the
interaction. The court found that the child expressed no difficulty
in his schooling or his stay in Bengaluru and ultimately satisfied
that the child is comfortable and secure with staying with his
mother.
16. The child in question is a boy, now around 11 years
and a naturalised US citizen with an American passport and his
parents viz., the appellant and respondent No. 3 are holders of
Permanent US Resident Cards. These aspects were not given
due attention. So also, the fact that child in question was born
in USA on 03.02.2011 and till the year 2020 he was living and
studying there, was also not given due weight while considering
question of welfare of the child. Merely because he was brought
to India by the mother on 03.03.2020 and got him admitted in a
school and that he is now feeling comfortable with schooling
and stay in Bengaluru could not have been taken as factors for
considering the welfare of the boy aged 11 years born and lived
nearly for a decade in USA. The very fact that he is a naturalised
citizen of US with American passport and on that account he might,
in all probability, have good avenues and prospects in the country
where he is a citizen. This crucial aspect has not been appreciated
at all. In our view, taking into account the entire facts and
circumstances and the environment in which the child had born and
was brought up for about a decade coupled with the fact that he is a
naturalised American citizen, his return to America would be in his
best interest. In this case it is also to be noted that on two occasions
American courts ordered to return the child to USA. True that the
first order to that effect was vacated at the instance of
respondent No. 3. However, taking into account all aspects, we
are of the view that it is not a fit case where courts in India
should refuse to acknowledge the orders of the US Courts
directing return of the minor child to the appellant keeping in view
the best interests of the child. In our view, a consideration on the
point of view of the welfare of the child would only support the order
for the return of the child to his native country viz., USA. For, the
child is a naturalised American citizen with American passport. He
has been brought up in the social and culture value milieu of USA
and, therefore, accustomed to the lifestyle, language, custom, rules
and regulations of his native country viz., USA. Further, he will have
better avenues and prospects if he returns to USA, being a
naturalised American citizen.
17. In this case during the course of the arguments the
learned counsel for the appellant on behalf of the appellant
submitted that in case respondent No. 3 wants to return and stay in
US with her parents so as to have proximity to and opportunity to
take care of the child the appellant is prepared to do the needful, if
the respondent No. 3 so desires. It is further submitted that the
appellant is also prepared to find suitable accommodation for them
in that regard.”
9. It is pellucid from the above judgments that the Habeas Corpus
Petition is maintainable and this Court can invoke its extraordinary
jurisdiction for the best interests of the children. There is also sufficient
indication in the above judgments as to how to deal in cases where the child
is a naturalised foreign citizen and has grown and lived in a foreign soil for a
sufficiently long time.
10. The children in question are now aged about 14½ years and they
are naturalised US citizens with an American passport and their parents viz.
the petitioner and the 1st respondent are also holders of American citizenship.
During their early years, they were sent to a Montessori school system and
thereafter, they joined Grace Episcopal School and studied there till 4th
standard and thereafter joined St.Albans School where they continued till
their 7th standard. It is also seen from records that the children were exposed
to various extra-curricular activities like swimming, basketball, music, chess
etc. and they both are Gold medallists in the Science Olympiad. Infact,
even qualified for Junior Olympics in swimming while he was
training with St. Albans School swimming team. All this was going well till
the end of 2020.
11. The children travelled to India and they are staying here from
27.12.2020 onwards, in the custody of the 1st respondent. Unfortunately, the
children are now made to undergo online schooling and from one of the
messages that was sent by the 1st respondent, we are able to see that the
children, in order to meet the timelines, have to attend classes sometimes at
wee hours at 1.30 a.m./ 2.30 a.m. IST.
12. We had an opportunity to interview the children and we realised
that the children are under the complete control of the 1st respondent and they
were willing to let go of all those facilities which they enjoyed and were
expressing their intention to continue with online classes. In matters of this
nature, the Court does not decide based on what the children say, since they
are in the midst of a huge turmoil in their life and hence, the duty is cast upon
this Court to decide based on best interest of the children.
13. As on today, the children are undergoing online schooling with
George Washington University. The maximum interaction that takes place is
with the teachers for a couple of hours, 4 days a week. That apart, all the
other activities in which these children were involved till 2020, has come to a
grinding halt. The children have lost physical contact with other children and
their physical activities have also virtually stopped. The children are also
slowly losing touch with the petitioner and we shudder to think as to what
impression they will be carrying about the petitioner, since they are in the
grips of their mother. The continuance of the present status, will damage the
progress of these children, not only in terms of academics, but more on their
emotional quotient. The children are now living in an environment, which is
alien to them, since the best part of their life, for nearly 13 years, was spent
only in the USA.
14. In our considered view, the best interest of the children can be
ensured only if the children return back to their native country viz., USA. The
children, who are naturalised American citizens, were brought up in the social
and cultural value milieu of USA and they are accustomed to the lifestyle,
language, customs, rules and regulations of their native country and they will
have their better avenues and prospects only if they return back to USA. The
children have not developed roots in India and hence, no harm will be caused
to them if they return back to USA.
15. This Court also takes into consideration the order passed by the
competent Court at USA granting permanent custody to the petitioner. The 1st
respondent, who submitted herself to the jurisdiction of the concerned Court,
for reasons best known to her, has started initiating variety of proceedings in
India and her faint attempt to initiate custody proceedings in India, also met
its waterloo, when her petition got dismissed. Hence, the 1st respondent
cannot be permitted to disregard the order passed by a competent Court in
USA and hold the children in her custody in India. We also take into
consideration the offer made by the learned Senior Counsel to the effect that
the 1st respondent can also accompany the children to USA and that the
petitioner is willing to accommodate the 1st respondent along with the
children.
16. In the light of the above discussion, we allow this Habeas Corpus
Petition in the following terms:
a) The 1st respondent is directed to take immediate steps to ensure
that                  and              return back to USA and this
process shall be completed by the 1st respondent within a period of
six weeks from the date of uploading of this order in the High Court
website. The custody of the children shall be handed over to the
petitioner within a period of eight weeks from the date of
uploading of this order in the High Court website.
b) It is left open to the 1st respondent to accompany the children to
USA and in which case, the petitioner shall accommodate the 1st
respondent and provide her with all facilities and maintenance.
c) If the 1st respondent is not willing to stay at USA, there shall be
a direction to the 1st respondent to accompany the children to USA
and handover custody of the children to the petitioner.
d) The petitioner shall make immediate arrangements to get the
children relieved from the present school and admit the children in a
regular     school      and     shall    provide    them    with       all
facilities/opportunities which they used to enjoy earlier.
e) If the 1st respondent requires custody or visitation rights of the
children, it is left open to the 1st respondent to work out her remedy
before the appropriate Court in USA and ;
f) Insofar as the matrimonial dispute between the petitioner and the
1st respondent is concerned, it shall be agitated independently in the
manner known to law and the observations made in this judgment
shall not come in the way of the 1st respondent.
