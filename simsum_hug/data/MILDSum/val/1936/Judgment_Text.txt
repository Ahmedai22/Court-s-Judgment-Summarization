with the consent of the learned counsel for the rival parties.
(2)                    The petitioner is one of the two accused persons in
First Information Report (FIR) No. 429 of 2021, dated 24/09/2021,
registered at Police Station, Parva, Taluka–Ghatanji, District–Yavatmal,
for offence under Section 306 read with 34 of the Indian Penal Code,
1860 (IPC). The present writ petition is filed seeking quashing of the
aforesaid FIR and charge-sheet filed in pursuance thereof.
(3)                The facts leading up to filing of the present writ
petition are that – one Kavadu Sambhaji Tiple, committed suicide on
14/09/2021 by hanging himself on a tree in an agricultural field,
within the jurisdiction of the aforesaid Police Station. The son-in-law
of the deceased i.e. Mahadev Narayan Kamble caused the FIR to be
registered after 10 days on 24/09/2021, against the petitioner and her
mother. A perusal of the report, leading to registration of the FIR,
shows that it is based almost entirely on the contents of two suicide
notes found on the person of the deceased.      The contents of the two
suicide notes are identical, wherein the deceased stated that he was
fed up with life and constrained to take the extreme step because of
the petitioner and her mother. On this basis, the FIR stood registered
and police undertook investigation.
(4)                During the course of investigation, the police
recorded statements of witnesses and took the suicide notes on record.
The charge-sheet was filed on 27/11/2021 and it was stated therein
that the material on record pointed towards the guilt of the petitioner
and her mother for offence under Section 306 read with 34 of the IPC.
Much emphasis was placed on the suicide note dated 09/09/2021.
This Court issued notice in the present writ petition, wherein the
respondent No.1 State appeared through the learned Assistant Public
Prosecutor. The respondent No.2 i.e. original informant/ complainant
was served, but he chose not to appear before this Court.
(5)                 Mr. A. M. Sudame, learned counsel appearing for
the petitioner submitted that even if the FIR, charge-sheet and the
material available on record were to be taken into consideration, the
ingredients of the offence under Section 306 of the IPC were not made
out against the petitioner and that therefore, the FIR and the charge-
sheet deserved to be quashed. It was submitted that, applying the
position of law laid down by the Hon’ble Supreme Court and this Court
in various judgments as regards offence under Section 306 of the IPC,
even if the contents of the suicide note allegedly left behind by the
deceased were to be accepted, ingredients of the offence under Section
306 of the IPC were not made out, because the essential aspect of
abetment as defined under Section 107 of the IPC was absent and it
could not be said that the petitioner before this Court was even prima
facie liable for instigating the deceased to commit suicide. Reference
was made to a number of judgments in support of the aforesaid
contentions,     which will be referred to at the appropriate place
(6)                 The learned counsel for the petitioner referred to
Sections 107 and 306 of the IPC and read the suicide note in detail, to
submit that at worst the contents thereof brought out the anguish of
the deceased in respect of the demands for share in property made by
the co-accused i.e. mother of the petitioner, allegedly at the behest of
the petitioner. It was submitted that the demands made by the mother
of the petitioner, even if at the instigation of the petitioner, could at
worst be said to be demands that the accused persons thought were
genuine and it could not be said that such demands were made with
the intention to drive the deceased to commit suicide. It was further
submitted that there was no proximity between the suicide note, which
was written on 09/09/2021 and the actual act, which took place on
14/09/2021.     On this basis it was submitted that the present writ
petition deserved to be allowed.
(7)                On the other hand, Mr. S. M. Ghodeswar, learned
APP submitted that the material available on record, particularly the
suicide note, clearly demonstrated that no option was left for the
deceased, but to take the extreme step, because of the aggressive
behavior of the co-accused i.e. mother of the petitioner, due to
instigation on the part of the petitioner.    It was submitted that a
perusal of the suicide note and the material available on record with
the charge-sheet demonstrated that prima facie the ingredients of the
offence under Section 306 of the IPC were made out and that the
actions attributed to the petitioner were prima facie covered under the
concept of abetment as per Section 107 of the IPC. By referring to the
various judgments on which the learned counsel appearing for the
petitioner had placed reliance, the learned APP submitted that
ultimately the Court in those cases had concluded in favour of the
accused on facts and that the facts of the present case were
distinguishable, demonstrating that no case was made out for quashing
of the FIR and the charge-sheet. The learned APP also relied upon
judgments to support his arguments and they shall be referred to at
the appropriate place hereinbelow.
(8)                In order to appreciate the contentions raised on
behalf of the petitioner as well as the respondent – State, it would be
necessary to refer to Sections 107 and 306 of the IPC which read as
“107. Abetment of a thing — A person abets the doing of a
thing, who — First — Instigates any person to do that
Secondly — Engages with one or more other person or
persons in any conspiracy for the doing of that thing, if an
act or illegal omission takes place in pursuance of that
conspiracy, and in order to the doing of that thing; or
Thirdly — Intentionally aids, by any act or illegal omission,
the doing of that thing.
306. Abetment of suicide — If any person commits suicide,
whoever abets the commission of such suicide, shall be
punished with imprisonment of either description for a term
which may extend to ten years, and shall also be liable to
fine.”
(9)                The consideration and analysis of the above quoted
provisions has attracted the attention of the Supreme Court and this
Court in various cases and the judgments rendered by the Courts have
elucidated the essential ingredients of the same and they are guiding
lights for applying the aforesaid provisions to the facts of individual
cases. Before applying the principles that can be culled out from the
said judgments to the facts of the present case, it would be appropriate
to refer to some of them.
(10)                This Court is referring to only those judgments
relied upon by the learned counsel for the petitioner where the Courts
were concerned with the question of quashing of FIR/Charge-sheet
under Section 482 of the Cr.P.C. or exercise of power in writ
jurisdiction for quashing of the same and where the accused contended
that the criminal proceedings did not deserve to be continued any
(11)                In the case of Swamy Prahalddas Vs. State of M.P.
and another, 1995 Supp (3) SCC 438 , the Supreme Court was
considering a situation where the accused was alleged to have
remarked to the deceased ‘to go and die’ and thereafter, the deceased
committed suicide. Even in such a situation the Supreme Court held
that the allegations, even if they were to be accepted as it is, did not
prima facie reflect mens rea on the part of the accused and it was also
found that the deceased did have time to weigh the pros and cons of
the act by which he ultimately ended his life. It was held that the
accused need not face the charge in such a situation.
(12)                In the case of Sanju Alias Sanjay Singh Sengar Vs.
State of M.P., (2002) 5 SCC 371, the Supreme Court was considering a
situation where the deceased had left behind a suicide note, wherein it
was specifically stated that the accused was responsible for his death.
In the said case, the Supreme Court considered the liability of the
accused to face investigation and prosecution under Section 306 of the
IPC, in the context of Section 107 thereof and it was held that the
word “instigate” denotes incitement or urging to do some drastic or
inadvisable action or to stimulate or incite, further holding that
presence of mens rea, therefore, was a necessary concomitant of
instigation.    It was found that in the said case the alleged abusive
words were used by the accused against the deceased, two days prior
to the date when the deceased was found hanging.                     In these
circumstances, the Supreme Court found it fit to quash the criminal
(13)               In the case of Madan Mohan Singh Vs. State of
Gujarat and another, (2010) 8 SCC 628, the accused was alleged to
have instigated his driver to commit suicide. There was a suicide note
of 15 pages left behind by the deceased and the accused had
approached the High Court for quashing of the FIR and the criminal
proceedings, but his prayer was rejected, as consequence of which, the
accused was before the Supreme Court seeking relief. The Supreme
Court applied Section 306 read with 107 of the IPC and found that
there has to be proximity between the alleged acts of the accused and
the extreme step taken by the deceased of committing suicide. It was
held that the allegations made and the material ought to be of a
definite nature and not imaginary or inferential. The Supreme Court
went into the suicide note of about 15 pages and found that the
contents thereof expressed the anguish of the deceased, who felt that
his boss (the accused) had wronged him, but it was noted that the
contents fell short of depicting an intentional act on the part of the
accused for driving the deceased to commit suicide. On this basis, the
judgment of the High Court was set aside and the FIR and criminal
proceedings were quashed.
(14)                  In the case of S.S. Chheena Vs. Vijay Kumar
Mahajan and another, (2010) 12 SCC 190 , the Supreme Court
considered the facts of the said case and after referring to Sections 107
and 306 of the IPC, found that the High Court had erred in not
quashing the criminal proceedings. Reference was made to a series of
judgments on the aspect of abetment, particularly in the context of
instigation. It was observed in the said judgment as follows : -
“25.            Abetment involves a mental process of instigating a
person or intentionally aiding a person in doing of a thing.
Without a positive act on the part of the accused to instigate or aid
in committing suicide, conviction cannot be sustained. The
intention of the legislature and the ratio of the cases decided by
this Court is clear that in order to convict a person under Section
306 IPC there has to be a clear mens rea to commit the offence.
It also requires an active act or direct act which led the deceased
to commit suicide seeing no option and that act must have been
intended to push the deceased into such a position that he
committed suicide.
26.             In the instant case, the deceased was undoubtedly
hypersensitive to ordinary petulance, discord and differences
which happen in our day-to-day life. Human sensitivity of each
individual differs from the other.        Different people behave
differently in the same situation.”
(15)                  Similarly, in the case of M.Mohan Vs. State
Represented by the Deputy Superintendent of Police, (2011) 3 SCC
626, the Supreme Court held in the context of abetment as follows: -
“44.          Abetment involves a mental process of instigating a
person or intentionally aiding a person in doing of a thing. Without
a positive act on the part of the accused to instigate or aid in
committing suicide, conviction cannot be sustained.
45.           The intention of the legislature and the ratio of the
cases decided by this court are clear that in order to convict a
person under section 306 IPC there has to be a clear mens rea to
commit the offence. It also requires an active act or direct act
which led the deceased to commit suicide seeing no option and
this act must have been intended to push the deceased into such
a position that he/she committed suicide.”
(16)                 The Supreme Court in the said case also emphasized
that there ought to be a proximate link between the incidents alleged
against the accused and the suicide by the deceased. On the facts of
the said case, it was found that when the alleged incidents had taken
place about four days prior to the suicide committed by the deceased,
no proximate link could be attributed.
(17)                 In the case of Vaijnath Kondiba Khandke Vs. State of
Maharashtra and another, (2018) 7 SCC 781 , the Supreme Court took
note of the fact that there were indeed two lines of cases in the context
of quashing of criminal proceedings, when the accused was facing
charge of offence under Section 306 of the IPC. After taking note
thereof, in the said judgment, the Supreme Court held that the accused
may face trial if the material on record prima facie shows that the
situation was created deliberately by the accused so as to drive the
victim to suicide. On the facts of the said case, it was found that the
FIR and the criminal proceedings deserved to be quashed.
(18)                  In the case of Geo Varghese Vs. State of Rajasthan
and another, 2021 SCC Online SC 873, the Supreme Court held as
“23.          What is required to constitute an alleged abetment
of suicide under Section 306 IPC is there must be an allegation of
either direct or indirect act of incitement to the commission of
offence of suicide and mere allegations of harassment of the
deceased by another person would not be sufficient in itself,
unless, there are allegations of such actions on the part of the
accused which compelled the commission of suicide. Further, if
the person committing suicide is hypersensitive and the
allegations attributed to the accused is otherwise not ordinarily
expected to induce a similarly situated person to take the extreme
step of committing suicide, it would be unsafe to hold the accused
guilty of abetment of suicide. Thus, what is required is an
examination of every case on its own facts and circumstances
and keeping in consideration the surrounding circumstances as
well, which may have bearing on the alleged action of the
accused and the psyche of the deceased.”
(19)                 In the case of Shabbir Hussain Vs. The State of
Madhya Pradesh and Ors. (order dated 26/07/2021 passed in SLP
(Cri.)No.7284/2017), the Supreme Court relied upon earlier judgment
in the case of Amalendu Pal Vs. State of West Bengal, (2010) 1 SCC
707, and held that mere harassment without any positive action on the
part of the accused proximate to the time of occurrence, which led to
the suicide, would not amount to an offence under Section 306 of the
(20)                  The said position of law was followed by the
Division Bench of this Court in the case of Dilip S/o Ramrao Shirasao
and Ors. Vs. State of Maharashtra and anr. (Criminal Application
(APL) No.332/2016) and the criminal proceedings were quashed. It
was held in the said judgment as follows: -
“20.           As has been held by Their Lordships of the Apex
Court that for permitting a trial to proceed against the accused for
the offence punishable under Section 306 of the Indian Penal
Code, it is necessary for the prosecution to at least prima facie
establish that the accused had an intention to aid or instigate or
abet the deceased to commit suicide. In the absence of
availability of such material, the accused cannot be compelled to
face trial for the offence punishable under Section 306 of the
Indian Penal Code. As has been held by Their Lordships of the
Apex Court that abetment involves mental process of instigating
a person or intentionally aiding a person in doing of a thing and
without a positive act on the part of the accused in aiding or
instigating or abeting the deceased to commit suicide, the said
persons cannot be compelled to face the trial. Unless there is
clear mens rea to commit an offence or active act or direct act,
which led the deceased to commit suicide seeing no option or the
act intending to push the deceased into such a position, the trial
against the accused under Section 306 of the Indian Penal Code,
in our considered view, would be an abuse of process of law.”
(21)                 Much emphasis was placed by the learned APP on
recent judgment of the Supreme Court in the case of Mahendra K.C.
Vs. State of Karnataka and another, (2022) 2 SCC 129 , wherein the
Supreme Court set aside an order passed by the High Court granting
relief of quashing of criminal proceedings in an offence under Section
306 and 107 read with 34 of the IPC. In the said case also, a suicide
note was left behind by the deceased. The Supreme Court reversed the
order of the High Court by reading the suicide note, accepting the
contents as they were and holding that the High Court had erred in
analyzing the same from its own perspective, while examining the
veracity of the allegations. It was held that the approach adopted by
the High Court in the said case was not sustainable, although the
position of law laid down by the Supreme Court in earlier judgments
in the context of Sections 107 and 306 of the IPC, was indeed taken
note of. But, on the facts of the said case, the Supreme Court found
that quashing of criminal proceedings was not justified and that the
accused deserved to face trial.
(22)               Similarly, the Supreme Court in the cases of
Didigam Bikshpathi and another Vs. State of A.P., AIR 2008 SC 527,
Munshiram Vs. State of Rajasthan, AIR 2018 SC 1923 and Narayan
Malhari Thorat Vs. Vinayak Deorao Bhagat, AIR 2019 SC 224 , found
on facts and on perusing suicide notes in the said cases that prima
facie ingredients of offence under Section 306 read with 107 of the IPC
were made out and accordingly held against the accused persons.
(23)               Therefore, it becomes clear that the principles that
have been laid down by the Supreme Court in the aforementioned
judgments in the context of Sections 107 and 306 of the IPC, have to
be applied to the facts of the individual case to conclude, as to whether
the criminal proceedings deserve to be interdicted at this stage of FIR
and charge-sheet itself or that the accused deserves to face trial.
(24)               In order to apply the aforementioned principles laid
down by the Supreme Court and followed by this Court, it would be
necessary to refer to the suicide note in the present case. The material
available on record shows that the oral report lodged by the
informant/complainant was virtually based on the aforementioned
suicide note. A perusal of the suicide note shows that it was dated
09/09/2021, while the actual act of suicide was committed on
14/09/2021. We have noted above that even when there was a gap of
only two days between the incident alleged against the accused and
the actual act of suicide committed by the deceased, the Supreme
Court found that there was no proximate link between the two,
because the deceased had enough time to weigh the pros and cons of
the act of committing suicide.
(25)                The suicide note shows that the deceased stated the
(a)   The co-accused i.e. Shobha, mother of the petitioner, was
the second wife of the deceased.
(b)   Shobha was illiterate and she used to act as per the advice
given by her elder daughter Lata i.e. the petitioner.
(c)Last year it was agreed between Shobha and the deceased
that a fixed deposit of Rs.2,00,000/- would be made in her
name to take care of her expenses.
(d)    The petitioner was not happy with the situation and she
asked    her   mother   Shobha      (co-accused)       to     demand
Rs.5,00,000/- from the deceased.
(e)    As a consequence, the deceased spoke to his relatives and
when they agreed to help him, the deceased agreed to give
Rs.5,00,000/- to Shobha.
(f) But, the petitioner asked Shobha to increase the demand to
Rs.15,00,000/- or three acres of agricultural land.
(g)    The deceased did not have agricultural land and he also
did not have Rs.15,00,000/- and due to this the petitioner
was angry with him and using her mother i.e. co-accused
Shobha, she had started harassing the deceased.                       The
petitioner was asking her mother Shobha (co-accused) to
threaten the deceased by coming to Dorli.
(h)    Shobha did come to Dorli and abused the deceased and
threatened that she will file false report against him, that she
will set herself on fire or take poison and report that the
(i) Shobha was capable of doing the same as she had earlier
lodged some false reports.
(j) Shobha and her daughter i.e. the petitioner had harassed the
deceased.     He found no meaning in living any further as
people close to him had turned against him and hence, he was
committing suicide for which he held the accused responsible.
(26)                 The contents of the suicide note have been heavily
emphasized upon by the learned APP to contend that a prima facie
case regarding ingredients of offence under Section 306 read with 107
of the IPC are clearly made out and that therefore, the petitioner
deserves to face trial.
(27)                We have analyzed the contents of the suicide note,
the gist of which is stated hereinabove. We find that the contents of the
suicide note bring out anguish of the deceased as regards the alleged
harassment by the petitioner and her mother. But, it also brings out
the fact that Shobha (co-accused) i.e. mother of the petitioner was the
second wife of the deceased and that at worst the said Shobha (co-
accused) at the behest of the petitioner was making monetary
demands or asking for a share in agricultural land from the deceased.
The informant in the present case is the son-in-law the deceased, who
is married to the daughter of the deceased from his first wife.
(28)               As held by the Supreme Court in the case of Geo
Varghese Vs. State of Rajasthan (supra) the Court is required to take
into consideration surrounding circumstances as well, which may have
a bearing on the alleged action of the accused and the psyche of the
deceased. It is significant that in the present case the petitioner,
allegedly through her mother, was making demands towards share in
the agricultural land or monetary relief from the father. We are of the
opinion that such repeated demands or alleged increase in the
demands cannot lead to a finding that prima facie the demands were
being made with the intention of driving the father to commit suicide.
The demand in itself, at worst, may have been unreasonable or a
demand which the father was unable to fulfill, but it would be
stretching things a bit far to reach a finding that the accused as the
daughter, through her mother i.e. co-accused, intentionally acted in
such a manner to drive the deceased to commit suicide.                          The
surrounding circumstances also indicate that the deceased had two
wives and children from both the wives and it cannot be said that
driving the deceased to commit suicide would have led to any
exclusive gain to the petitioner.
(29)               It is also significant, as noted above, that the suicide
note is dated 09/09/2021, while the actual act of committing suicide
took place after about five days on 14/09/2021.                 There is no
proximate link between the suicide note recording harassment
allegedly at the behest of the petitioner and the extreme step taken by
the deceased on 14/09/2021. The judgment in the case of Mahendra
K.C. Vs. State of Karnataka (supra) of the Supreme Court is
distinguishable on facts, for the reason that there was specific threat of
being killed by rowdies, recorded in the suicide note, which led to
anxiety and fear in the mind of the deceased, but such is not the case
in the present matter.
(30)               Applying the position of law clarified by the
Supreme Court in the aforementioned judgments to the facts of the
present case, we are convinced that a case is made out for interdicting
the criminal proceedings, by quashing the FIR and the charge-sheet for
the reason that the material available on record does not indicate that
the petitioner deserves to face trial for alleged offence under Section
306 of the IPC.
(31)                  In view of the above, the present writ petition is
allowed and the FIR No.429/2021 dated 24/09/2021, as also charge-
sheet bearing No.449/2021 dated 27/11/2021 are quashed, insofar
the petitioner before this Court is concerned.
(32)                  Rule made absolute in above terms.
