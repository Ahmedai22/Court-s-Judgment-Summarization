2.         Heard Shri. Swapnil Ovalekar, learned appointed
Advocate for the Appellant and Shri. Agarkar, learned APP for the
3.         Learned   APP      has  submitted   a   report      from      the
Superintendent of Nashik Road Central Prison dated 18/07/2022.
It is mentioned in the report that the Appellant had suffered actual
imprisonment of 5 years, 4 months and 8 days till 15/05/2022.
After that he was released on Covid-19 parole and then he has not
4.         The prosecution case is that the injured Nandkumar
Joshi in this case was travelling in a bogie for handicapped persons
in Kasara bound local train. He boarded the train at Dombivali. At
that time, the Appellant was standing at the door. It was difficult
for the injured to enter the bogie and, therefore, there was some
heated exchange of words. The other passengers supported the
injured. One of them even slapped the Appellant. There was
further trouble. The Appellant scuffled with others and pushed the
injured Joshi from the bogie from a running train. Joshi fell down
3 of 21               205-apeal-128-18 (Judgment)
and suffered compound fracture of his right elbow. He also
suffered injuries on his head. The co-passengers caught the
appellant in the bogie itself. Somebody pulled the chain. The train
stopped at Kalyan station. In the meantime, the injured had
walked back upto Dombivali railway station. He was helped by
railway police. The Appellant was brought from Kalyan and was
handed-over to the police. The F.I.R. was lodged. The investigation
was carried out. The charge-sheet was filed and the case was
committed to the court of Sessions.
5.         During trial, the prosecution examined 13 witnesses
including the injured Nandkumar Joshi, two eye witnesses, the
Motorman and the Guard of the local train, two Medical officers,
G.R.P. personnels, Deputy Station Master of Kalyan Railway station
and two Investigating Officers.
6.         The defence of the Appellant was that, he was travelling
in that local train in a bogie for handicapped people. A passenger
asked him to get down. He told him that he would get down on
the next station, but the passengers started abusing and beating
4 of 21                 205-apeal-128-18 (Judgment)
him with kicks and fist blows, though he was standing at the inner
side of the bogie. A false case was lodged against him. He has not
committed anything wrong.
His defence was not accepted by learned trial Judge.
He believed the evidence of the prosecution. According to learned
trial Judge, all the ingredients of Section 307 of I.P.C. were made
out. After recording his conclusion, he convicted and sentenced the
Appellant, as mentioned earlier.
7.         The prosecution case unfolds through the evidence of
PW-1 Nandkumar Joshi. He has deposed that, he was having issue
of blood pressure. He boarded a fast local train going towards
Kasara at 7.19p.m. on 09/01/2015 from Dombivli railway station.
He boarded a bogie for handicapped persons. The Appellant was
standing at the door obstructing the entrance. PW-1 requested him
to shift aside, but the Appellant started abusing and assaulting him
with fists. The other passengers tried to pacify him, but he was not
in a mood to listen. One of the co-passengers slapped the
Appellant on the back side. PW-1 tried to intervene and stop the
5 of 21                   205-apeal-128-18 (Judgment)
quarrel, but the Appellant was angry with him due to the incident
at the entrance of the bogie. He pushed the PW-1 from the bogie.
PW-1 fell down. His right hand was fractured at the elbow joint.
He also received six severe injuries to his head. He went towards
Dombivli by walking. According to him, the incident took place between
Dombivali and Thakurli railway station. He reached the platform
No.2 of the Dombivali railway station. Somebody took him to the
railway police on platform No.3. A memo from the Station Master
was obtained and the PW-1 was taken to Shastri Nagar Hospital.
The Medical Officer gave him first aid treatment and referred him
to Sion Hospital. Till then his relatives came there. Then he was
taken to Sai Sadan Hospital, Kalyan; where he was treated further.
The police came to Sai Sadan Hospital and recorded his F.I.R. The
F.I.R. was produced on record at Exhibit 15. He was hospitalized
for about 9 to 10 days. He identified his own blood stained clothes
in the Court. He also identified the Appellant in the Court.
In the cross-examination, he deposed that, while
lodging his F.I.R. he had mentioned that the said boy scuffled with
him when he entered the bogie, however, that particular portion
6 of 21                  205-apeal-128-18 (Judgment)
was not mentioned in his statement before the police and he could
not assign any reason as to why the word ‘scuffle’ was not
mentioned in his statement. He was suffering from high blood
pressure and he agreed that if his blood pressure shot up, he felt
giddiness and usually fell down. On 09/01/2015, his blood
pressure was high. He accepted that, because of heavy crowd there
was no place to sit in the bogie. He denied the suggestion that, he
fell down due to giddiness suffered because of blood pressure.
After the incident, he saw the Appellant for the first time while his
evidence was recorded in the Court. His F.I.R. at Exhibit 15
substantially corroborated his evidence.
8.          PW-4 Ashwin Purohit was one of the co-passengers. He
has deposed that, he was travelling in the same bogie at the time
of incident. PW-1 boarded the bogie at Dombivli railway station.
There was exchange of words between the Appellant and PW-1.
During that quarrel somebody shouted that, ‘uncle fell down from
the train’. PW-4 and others tried to pull the chain, but the train did
not stop. Some passengers caught the Appellant. The local train
arrived at Kalyan station. Then they alighted at Kalyan railway
7 of 21                205-apeal-128-18 (Judgment)
station and approached the R.P.F. office and reported the incident.
The Appellant was handed-over to R.P.F. officials. Then he was
handedover to Dombivli police. This witness stated that, he was
not in a position to identify the Appellant because he had seen him
only once at the time of the incident. Thus, his evidence describes
the incident in general and is not of much help to either the
prosecution or the defence. Its Evidentiary value is limited. It only
corroborates the prosecution case to a certain extent and
demonstrates that the incident had taken place.
9.        PW-9 Vivek Bhor is another important eye witness. He
has deposed that the incident took place on 09/01/2015. He
caught the Kasara local train at Mulund station at 07.08p.m. One
physically normal boy entered their bogie. The others told him to
get down, but he started quarreling with them. At Dombivli
railway station, PW-1 boarded the bogie. He also asked the
Appellant why he had boarded that bogie and there was quarrel.
The Appellant started scuffling and beating PW-1. This witness has
further deposed that, the Appellant pushed PW-1 thrice. He pushed
on his chest and therefore, PW-1 fell down. Then he also pushed
8 of 21                205-apeal-128-18 (Judgment)
PW-1’s legs. PW-1 fell down between Thakurli and Kalyan. The
other passengers caught the Appellant. One Ashwin Purohit
(PW-9) travelling in the train pulled the chain and also caught the
Appellant. The others also helped him in catching the Appellant.
The local train did not stop at Thakurli station, but stopped at
Kalyan railway station at about 7.30p.m. Then railway officers
along with R.P.F. came there. The Appellant was handed over to
them. This witness identified the Appellant in the Court as the
person who had pushed the PW-1 from the train. There were
certain portions of his depositions which were not mentioned by
him in his police statement. Those portions in the form of
omissions were put to him. He could not explain as to why those
portions were not appearing in his police station. He could not
explain why it was not mentioned that, PW-1 was talking with the
Appellant angrily, or that the Appellant beat PW-1, or that the
Appellant pushed PW-1 thrice, or that he had given two jerks on
the chest and one jerk on the leg. All these omissions were
important, however, the defence has not taken care to prove these
omissions through the evidence of the Investigating officer.
9 of 21                205-apeal-128-18 (Judgment)
Therefore, those omissions cannot be used by the defence in this
From the evidence of these three witnesses i.e. PW-1,
PW-4 and PW-9 the incident is established as to how the PW-1 was
pushed by the Appellant outside the running train. The other
evidence is mostly supportive in nature.
10.         PW-2 Harjiram Menon was Deputy Station Master at
Kalyan Railway station. He has deposed that the concerned local
arrived at Kalyan at 7.28p.m. The motorman gave a specific sound
indicating an emergency and seeking help. The railway officials
went to the local train and heard the noise from the coach for
handicapped persons. They went there and found that the
Appellant was caught by some passengers. The R.P.F. personnels
were called. The boy was handedover to them and then he was
taken to G.R.P. police station, Kalyan. This witness identified the
Appellant in the Court. Thus, this witness has not deposed about
the main incident, but has given evidence about handing over of
the Appellant to the police officers.
11.        PW-3 Sachin Ugale was attached to G.R.P. Kalyan. He has
deposed in a similar fashion as deposed by PW-2. He has deposed
that, after the co-passengers had apprehended the Appellant, he
was handed over to G.R.P. police station at Kalyan railway station.
The co-passengers Vivek Bhor – PW-9 and Ashwin Purohit – PW-4
were with him. The incident had taken place within the
jurisdiction of G.R.P. Dombivli police station and, therefore, the
Appellant was taken there and was handed over to P.S.O. of
Dombivali G.R.P. police station.
12.        PW-5 Suresh Jadhav was a point-man on platform Nos.4
and 5 of Kalyan railway station. He has also spoken about the co-
passengers having caught the appellant. He has supported the
evidence of PW-2 and 3.
13.        PW-6 Soheb Shaikh was a pancha in whose presence
personal search of the Appellant was conducted and then clothes
of the injured PW-1 were seized. Those panchanamas were
produced on record at Exhibit 33 and 34.
14.        PW-7 Ramgopal Verma was a Motorman of the said local
11 of 21               205-apeal-128-18 (Judgment)
train. He has deposed that the train halted at Dombivli platform at
7.25p.m. Thereafter it started from Dombivli and had reached
around Thakurli. He noticed the buzzer and audio sound
indicating chain pulling. According to him, at that time, the speed
of his local train was upto 100 Kms. per hour, but because of that
sound he reduced the speed to about 20Kms. per hour. Then he
gave a signal to the Guard who responded by giving normal buzzer
after verifying the situation. Therefore, he took the train to Kalyan
railway station. Then he gave whistle sound indicating some
trouble. The Station Master responded and then the Appellant was
15.        PW-8 Prakash Swami was the Guard on that train. He
has deposed similar to PW-7.
16.        PW-10 Dr. Majetia Shamjibhai and PW-11 Dr. Swapnil
Zambre were examined by the prosecution to prove injuries. Both
of them had treated the injured PW-1. It is hardly in dispute that
the injured PW-1 had suffered following injuries:
i) Compound fracture injury on right forearm.
12 of 21                 205-apeal-128-18 (Judgment)
ii) Multiple C.L.W. on scalp over left ear-pinna.
In the cross-examination of PW-10, he accepted that if
the blood pressure shoots up the person may feel giddiness and
because of fall due to giddiness these injuries were possible. He
also accepted that there was no abnormalities in the brain of PW-1.
17.        PW-11 Dr. Zambre elaborated and deposed that, there
was Grade 3 B open fracture of radius ulna with bone loss. Size of
the injury was 8cm x 6cm x bone deep. The nature of injury was
grievous and dangerous to life. The injuries were possible if a
person was pushed from a running train. The second stage surgery
failed and the patient was advised for third stage surgery, but the
patient did not respond positively. All the medical papers were
produced on record. This witness also accepted that PW-1 was
suffering from blood pressure and those injuries were possible if a
person fell down from a running train because of giddiness caused
by blood pressure.
18.        PW-12 P.S.I. Jayant Dumbre was attached to Dombivali
(Railway) police station. He has deposed that, PW-1 came to their
13 of 21              205-apeal-128-18 (Judgment)
police station at about 10.00p.m. to 10.15p.m. and narrated the
incident. PW-1 was sent to Shastri Nagar Hospital, Dombivli along
with memo issued by the Station Master of Dombivli railway
station. The report of PW-1 was reduced into writing in the
hospital. This witness had carried out personal search of the
Appellant brought by two passengers. The clothes of the victim
were seized. The medical papers were collected by him. He
identified the Appellant before the Court.
19.        PW-13 Mahesh Bagve was the next Investigating Officer.
He had recorded the statements of various witnesses. He carried
out the remaining investigation and had submitted the charge-
20.        Learned counsel for the Appellant made following
That the prosecution has not proved its case beyond
reasonable doubt. The evidence of PW-1, PW-4 and PW-9 is not
consistent. PW-9 himself has given contrary answers and there are
major omissions in his evidence. The injuries could have been
14 of 21              205-apeal-128-18 (Judgment)
possible because of the fall caused by high blood pressure. The
nature of injuries do not match with the description of the
21.        Learned APP, on the other hand, submitted that the
prosecution has proved its case through the evidence of PW-1, PW-
4 and PW-9. Rest of the evidence sufficiently corroborates their
version. The Appellant was caught at the spot by co-passengers.
The PW-4 and PW-9 have specifically deposed about his arrest.
22.        I have considered these submissions. The evidence of
PW-1, PW-4 and PW-9 is consistent on major aspects. Though there
are minor discrepancies regarding some minor details, the incident
as a whole is consistently deposed by them. There are some
omissions in the evidence of PW-9 Vivek Bhor, but as mentioned
earlier, these omissions are not proved through the evidence of the
Investigating Officer. Even if those omissions are ignored, the
consistent fact which is proved by the prosecution beyond
reasonable doubt is that, after PW-1 boarded the train there was a
quarrel between him and the Appellant. There was also scuffle and
15 of 21               205-apeal-128-18 (Judgment)
quarrel between the Appellant and other passengers. In that
incident the Appellant deliberately pushed the PW-1 from a
running train. The PW-1 fell down and suffered these injuries.
Though, PW-4 had not actually seen the PW-1 falling from the
train, the PW-1 himself has deposed that, because of the push
given by the Appellant, he had fallen down. To that extent, the PW-
9 has supported the version of PW-1. Thus, the prosecution has
proved that, because of the quarrel the appellant got angry and he
deliberately pushed the PW-1 from a running train.
23.       The Appellant was caught in the bogie itself by co-
passengers. This fact is consistently deposed and proved through
the evidence of PW-4 and PW-9. In that behalf, both these
witnesses corroborate each other. They are further corroborated by
the evidence of PW-2 the Deputy Station Master of Kalyan Railway
station, PW-3 Sachin Ugale – G.R.P. personnel and PW-5 Suresh
Jadhav. These witnesses have deposed as to how the Appellant was
already caught by the co-passengers and how he was taken in their
custody by the officers. Thus, the prosecution has also proved that
the Appellant was caught by the co-passengers in the bogie itself
16 of 21               205-apeal-128-18 (Judgment)
after he had pushed the PW-1 from a running train. Though, PW-4
has not identified the Appellant, the PW-1, PW-9 and other
witnesses have identified the Appellant. Thus, the prosecution has
proved that the co-passengers had caught the Appellant in the
bogie after the incident. He was immediately caught at the scene
of offence.
24.       The medical evidence is also clear enough. The PW-11
has deposed that the injury was grievous and dangerous to life.
The injuries suffered by PW-1 are undisputed. Though, the injuries
are possible by falling from a running train; it is also established
that the Appellant had pushed the PW-1 and, therefore, he has
caused those injuries to PW-1.
25.       PW-7 Ramgopal Verma was a Motorman and in spite of
having received an indication of chain pulling, he went ahead upto
Kalyan railway station because of the signal given by the Guard.
He has deposed that the train was running at a speed of 100 Kms.
per hour when he received the signal of chain pulling. The incident
had taken place soon after the train had left the Dombivli railway
17 of 21               205-apeal-128-18 (Judgment)
station. The train was gathering speed. But when the PW-1 fell
down, the prosecution has not proved that, at that point of time
the train was running at a speed of 100 Kms. per hour. The chain
was pulled after the PW-1 had already fallen down from the bogie.
Thus, the prosecution has not proved that, at that point of time the
train was running in a high speed. What is proved by the
prosecution is that the injured PW-1 was pushed from a running
train and that itself was dangerous. The prosecution has also not
established whether the injured PW-1 fell on another railway track
or on the side where there was no to and fro traffic of the local
trains. This aspect is important in considering whether the
Appellant had requisite intention necessary U/s.307 of I.P.C.
Thus, from the above discussion, I am of the opinion
that the prosecution has proved beyond reasonable doubt that, in
the quarrel and scuffle the Appellant had deliberately pushed the
PW-1 from a running train, causing grievous injury.
26.        The next crucial question is whether the offence would
fall within the four corners of Section 307 of I.P.C. In that behalf,
18 of 21              205-apeal-128-18 (Judgment)
the prosecution evidence is lacking. The prosecution case falls
short of proving offence U/s.307 of I.P.C. From the evidence
discussed above, it is clear that the Appellant was not knowing the
injured PW-1. There was no premeditation and no preparation for
commission of offence. The incident had taken place suddenly as a
result of sudden quarrel. In that quarrel the Appellant got angry
and pushed PW-1 from a running train. Therefore, his intention or
knowledge cannot be stretched to conclude that he attempted to
commit murder of PW-1. Though, it is proved that the injured PW-
1 had suffered grievous injury, which was even dangerous to his
life, the requisite intention and knowledge mentioned U/s.307 of
I.P.C. is not proved. From the nature of evidence, in my view,
though the ingredients of Section 307 of I.P.C. are not proved, the
ingredients of Section 308 of I.P.C. are proved by the prosecution.
Section 308 of I.P.C. reads thus:
“308. Attempt to commit culpable homicide. -
Whoever does any act with such intention or
knowledge and under such circumstances that, if
he by that act caused death, he would be guilty of
culpable homicide not amounting to murder, shall
be punished with imprisonment of either
description for a term which may extend to three
years, or with fine, or with both; and, if hurt is
caused to any person by such act, shall be
punished with imprisonment of either description
for a term which may extend to seven years, or
with fine, or with both.”
27.       As mentioned earlier, it was a sudden fight and,
therefore, there was no premeditation or preparation. At the same
time, the Appellant had pushed the injured from a running train,
therefore, he can be attributed knowledge that his act was
endangering to life of the PW-1. Therefore, his act would fall
within the meaning of Section 308 of I.P.C. To that extent, the
conviction recorded against the Appellant needs to be modified
and instead of Section 307 of I.P.C. the Appellant will have to be
convicted U/s.308 of I.P.C. which is a lesser offence. Since, in the
incident hurt is caused to         PW-1, the maximum punishment
prescribed U/s.308 of the I.P.C. can extend to 7 years. But in the
present case, looking at the nature of injuries suffered by PW-1, it
is not a case where maximum punishment is required to be
imposed on the Appellant. At the time of arrest, the Appellant was
hardly of 22 years old. He was recently married and was blessed
20 of 21                 205-apeal-128-18 (Judgment)
with a child only a few days before the incident. These are the
mitigating circumstances in deciding the quantum of sentence. The
Appellant has already suffered 5 years, 4 months and 8 days of
imprisonment for his act. Thus, the sentence can be reduced to the
period he has already undergone.
28.       With the result, following order is passed:
i)   The Appeal is partly allowed.
ii) The conviction and sentence of the Appellant
recorded U/s.307 of the I.P.C. is set aside.
iii) Instead, the Appellant is convicted for commission
of offence punishable U/s.308 of the I.P.C. His
sentence is reduced to the period which he has
already undergone.
iv) The imposition of fine of Rs.3000/- and in default
of payment of fine, sentence to suffer S.I. for 3
months is maintained.
v) The Appellant is granted benefit of Section 428 of
the Cr.p.c.
