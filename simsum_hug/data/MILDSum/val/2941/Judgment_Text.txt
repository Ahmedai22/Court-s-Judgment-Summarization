This Writ Petition has been filed by the petitioner
seeking a writ of mandamus declaring the impugned
proceeding     No.   TR2/255(12)/2016-PO(E&S),       dated
27.05.2016, Retirement notification No. P1/756(3)/16-
NLG, dated 01.01.2016 and Retirement Order No.
P1/756(1)/16-NLG, dated 30.06.2016, as illegal and
arbitrary and to direct the respondents to reinstate the
petitioner into service along with all consequential
benefits which the petitioner would have earned had the
petitioner not been prematurely retired from service on
2.    The brief facts of the case leading to filing of the
present   writ  petition  are  that  the  petitioner  was
appointed as a driver in the respondent’s Corporation on
03.11.1988 after undergoing due process of selection.
W.P.No.31952 of 2016
The services of the petitioner were regularized with effect
from 01.09.1989. At the time of entry into service, the
date   of  birth   of  the  petitioner  was  recorded          as
01.11.1961. While so, the 4th respondent had issued
notice dated 26.10.2015 asking the petitioner to submit
the supporting documents in support of his date of birth.
The petitioner had submitted his reply dated 07.06.2016
stating that his date of birth was recorded as 20.03.1963
in Transfer Certificate dated 26.03.1987 issued by the
3.    Thereafter, the 2nd respondent had passed the
impugned order dated 27.05.2016, reckoning the date of
birth of the petitioner as 22.06.1958, on the ground that
when the petitioner was examined by the APSRTC
Medical Officer on 22.06.1988, at the time of selection to
the post of driver, his age was recorded as 30 years and
therefore, the date of birth of the petitioner would be
W.P.No.31952 of 2016
22.06.1958. On the basis of the same, the petitioner was
retired from service vide Order No.P1/756(1)/16-NLG,
dated 30.06.2016. Challenging the same, the present
Writ Petition is filed.
3.    The learned counsel for the petitioner submitted
that the actual date of birth of the petitioner is
20.03.1963 and the same is recorded in the Transfer
Certificate and other nomination authorization forms
and physical fitness certificate dated 22.06.1988, but
they were not furnished with the attestation forms A & B
at the time of appointment. It is admitted that in all the
documents furnished by the petitioner at the time of
appointment     his    date of  birth  was   recorded          as
01.11.1961 and therefore, the petitioner was supposed to
continue in service till 30.11.2019 when he attained the
age of 58 years. It is the grievance of the petitioner that
the respondents, without giving any cogent reasons, have
retired the petitioner from service prematurely with effect
W.P.No.31952 of 2016
from 30.06.2016 afternoon. Therefore, he seeks notional
reinstatement of the petitioner and retirement of the
petitioner after attaining the age of superannuation in
the year 2019 and all the consequential attendant
benefits. In support of his contention that his date of
birth as recorded at the time of appointment should be
considered. Learned counsel for the petitioner placed
reliance upon the following judgments:
Prasaran Nigam Limited and Others1;
(ii)     B.Mallaiah Vs.  APSRTC,  Hyderabad        and
(iii) Writ Petition No.16974 of 2009, dated
(iv)      Writ  Appeal  No.1053  of 2011,      dated
4.        Learned Standing counsel for the respondent
corporation, on the other hand, submitted that the
petitioner, at the time of appointment had given a
particular date of birth and subsequently had claimed
date of birth to be different. He also submitted that the
petitioner had played fraud on the respondents by
claiming     to   be   “uneducated      person”       whereas
subsequently he has submitted the copy of transfer
certificate issued by a School. Therefore according to
him, there is fraud played by the petitioner on the
respondent Corporation. He submitted that during the
time of medical examination, at the time of entry into
service, the petitioner himself has stated his age as 30
years, which is recorded by the medical officer and
therefore, respondents have correctly adopted the age of
the petitioner to be 30 years as on the date of entry into
service and has accordingly retired the petitioner from
service on his attaining the age of superannuation. He
therefore, prayed for dismissal of the writ petition.
5.     Having regard to the rival contentions and the
material on record and also the precedents upon which
W.P.No.31952 of 2016
reliance has been placed by the learned counsel for the
petitioner, it is noticed that the respondent organization
is required to consider all the relevant certificates before
issuing an appointment letter to an employee. In this
case, the petitioner has given his date of birth as
01.11.1961 and the same is recorded in the official
records of the petitioner. While that being the case, it is
neither open to the petitioner nor to the respondents to
change the date of birth at the fag end of service of the
petitioner. This High Court in the case of B.Mallaiah Vs.
APSRTC             Hyderabad and  Others3, has    held      that
alteration of date of birth by employer in service records
of the employee, when he is at verge of his retirement is
not permissible. It was further held that just as the
petitioner cannot seek alteration of his date of birth at
the fag end of his service, the respondents also cannot
alter it on the verge of his retirement, that too, without
notice to him.
6.    In the case of S.B.Singh vs. APSRTC, in Writ
Petition No.16974 of 2009, dated 30.12.2009, this Court
has taken similar case of medical certificate into
consideration and has held that such medical certificate
is nothing but certificate of fitness for appointment and
though the petitioner was described as aged 30 years
therein, nothing could be placed before the Court by the
Corporation to show that there was any assessment of
the petitioner’s age by the medical officer before issuing
the said certificate. The Court has also taken cognizance
of the fact that though the petitioner’s age was
mentioned as 30 years as on the date of appointment,
but it was not the recorded date of birth as pointed out
by the petitioner. Therefore, the Court held that the
impugned action of respondent corporation in retiring
the petitioner on the basis of medical certificate is
arbitrary and illegal and hence, it was set aside. This
Judgment has also been upheld by the Division Bench of
W.P.No.31952 of 2016
the Court in Writ Petition No.1053 of 2011. Further, the
Hon’ble Supreme Court in the case of Shobha Ram
and Others4 has held that
Having given our thoughtful consideration to the
controversy, we are satisfied, that after the impugned
order of retirement dated 31.12.2002 was set aside,
the   appellant  was   entitled  to  all  consequential
benefits. The fault lies with the respondents in not
having utilised the services of the appellant for the
period from 1.1.2003 to 31.12.2005. Had the appellant
been allowed to continue in service, he would have
readily discharged his duties. Having restrained him
from rendering his services with effect from 1.1.2003
to 31.12.2005, the respondent cannot be allowed to
press the self serving plea of denying him wages for
the period in question, on the plea of the principle of
“no work no pay”.
7.        Respectfully following the above judgment, the
impugned order of the respondents is set aside as not
sustainable and the respondents Corporation is directed
to make payment of all consequential benefits to the
petitioner by giving him notional service till he attain the
age of superannuation i.e., 58 years by adopting his date
of birth as 01.11.1961 and pay all the consequential
benefits to the petitioner within a period of 120 days
from the date of receipt of copy of this order.
8.    Accordingly, this writ petition is allowed. There
shall be no order as to costs.
9.    Miscellaneous petitions, if any, pending in this Writ
Petition, shall stand closed.
