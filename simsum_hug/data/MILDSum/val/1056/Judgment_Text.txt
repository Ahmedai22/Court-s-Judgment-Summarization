The petitioner, a retired Engineer in Chief is before
this  Court    under   Articles  226   and   227    of  the
Constitution of India praying for a writ of certiorari to
quash the order bearing No.PMOPG/D/2022/0023890
dated 11.02.2022 vide Annexure-C and order bearing
No.MINHA/E/A/22/0000088 dated 10.03.2022 passed
by respondent No.2 vide Annexure-E and for a writ of
mandamus directing the respondents to consider the
case of the petitioner in terms of his request at
Annexures-A and B.
2.    Heard the learned counsel Sri.H.M.Umesh
for petitioner and learned ASG Sri.H.Shanthi Bhushan
for respondent Nos.1 to 3. Perused the writ petition
3.    Learned counsel for the petitioner would
submit that petitioner is a retired Engineer in Chief
from the respondents-Central Government. After his
retirement, he was appointed on contract basis by the
IIT for a period of two years for implementing projects
including IIT at Dharwad. Petitioner is before this Court
requesting for an appointment on honorarium basis as
Chief Engineer at Sri Rama Janma Bhumi.            Theertha
Kshethra. It is submitted that petitioner has made
representations and the same are rejected under
Annexures-C and E. Even the petitioner’s request
through    Grievance   Redressal    Web     Portal  is  not
considered properly and it is rejected showing subjudice
matter. Therefore, it is submitted that petitioner is
before this Court seeking for consideration of his
representation for appointment as Chief Engineer at
4.    Per contra, learned ASG vehemently opposes
the petition stating that petitioner, a retired Engineer in
Chief has no right to seek any appointment that too at
Rama Janma Bhumi Trust. Moreover, Trust is not a
State under Article 12 of Constitution of India. It is also
submitted that petitioner was also before this Court in
W.P.No.126424/2020, when he was relieved of his
duties as Chief Engineer [Projects] at Indian Institute of
Technology [IIT], Indore which came to be dismissed and
also filed Writ Appeal in W.A.No.100271/2021 which
was also dismissed on 09.03.2022. Thus, he prays for
dismissal of the writ petition.
5.    Having heard the learned counsel for the
parties and on perusal of the writ petition papers, I am
of the view that petitioner has no right to seek any
appointment as Chief Engineer. Moreover, petitioner’s
request is to appoint him as Chief Engineer for a period
of three years at Sri Rama Janma Bhumi theertha
Kshethra    and   Sri  Rama     Janma   Bhumi    theertha
Kshethra is not a State within the meaning of Article 12
of the Constitution of India, writ would not be
maintainable.   No writ could be issued for appointing
petitioner as Chief Engineer at Sri Rama Janma Bhumi
Theertha Kshethra.     Moreover, for issuance of writ of
mandamus one has to establish his legal right and
corresponding legal duty on the authority to consider
one’s request.   Since the petitioner has no right and
respondent has no duty to consider petitioner’s request,
no relief could be granted in this writ petition.
Accordingly writ petition stands rejected.
