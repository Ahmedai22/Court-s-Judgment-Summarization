Criminal Procedure Code, 1973 against the judgment and
order dated 21/01/2019             passed by the learned 7 th
Additional Sessions Judge, Anjar, Kachchh in Special
(Atrocity) Case No.28 of 2015 (Old Special (Atrocity) Case
No.4 of 2012 acquitting the respondent Nos.1 and 2                         –
original accused Nos.1 and 2 from the offence punishable
under sections 302 and 114 of Indian Penal Code and under
section 3(2)(5) of the Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribes
(Prevention of Atrocity) Act (hereinafter referred to as “the
Atrocity” Act) and under section 135 of the Gujarat Police
2.    Facts of the case, in brief, are as under:-
The complainant lodged the complaint alleging that
from 06/10/2011         to 07/10/2011         during the time
between19.30 hours and 1.15 hours, the complainant had
gone to the house of his mother situated at village
Jatawada, Taluka Rapar, Kachchh after taking dinner and
at her mother’s house, his brother Karshanbhai, Nanjibhai
and Rudo, his three sisters and his mother Laxmiben all
were watching television and at about 9 O’clock at night, the
complainant and his wife were going from the house of his
mother to his house and they had slept at his house along
with his children at night. Thereafter at about 1.15 at night,
his neighbour Parbatbhai Devshibhai Dalit awaken him and
told that there is call from Hakubha Sarpanch and
somebody has beaten his brother Deshra and he is serious.
Therefore, he had contacted Hakubha Sarpanch from the
mobile phone of Parbat and Hakubha Sarpanch informed
him that on the road going towards Khodiyar Temple, near
Rajput Vas, somebody has beaten on head of his brother
Deshra and has caused serious injuries and he is serious
and he is sent to Rapar Hospital in 108 Ambulance with
Rudabhai Raghabhai and he asked the complainant to
reach at the hospital immediately. At that time, police jeep
had     come       and the  complainant   and     his       brothers
Karshanbhai and Rudo, all three had gone to the hospital at
Rapar and there Rudabhai Rajput of his village had met and
treatment of his brother was going on and his brother could
not speak anything and there was bleeding from the head of
his brother and there was serious injuries on his head and
after sometime, doctor declared him dead. Hence, the
complaint is filed against unknown person with Rapar
Police Station vide CR No.I-99/2011 for the offence under
section 302 of Indian Penal Code and under section 135 of
3.    On the basis of the said complaint, investigation was
started and during the course of the investigation, offence
under section 114 of Indian Penal Code and under section
3(2)(5)     of the Atrocity Act came to be added and after
through investigation, as there was sufficient evidence
against the respondent Nos.1 and 2 – accused persons,
chargesheet was filed before the learned Judicial Magistrate,
First Class, Rapar. As the offence committed by the accused
persons was exclusively triable by the Court of Sessions as
per the provisions of Section 209 of Criminal Procedure
Code, the learned Judge was pleased to commit the case to
the Court of Sessions and the case was transferred and
placed for trial in the court of learned Additional Sessions
Judge, which has been numbered as Special (Atrocity) Case
No.4 of 2012 which was subsequently renumbered as
Special (Atrocity) Case No.28 of 2015. Thereafter, Charge
was framed against the accused for the offence punishable
under sections 302 and 114 of Indian Penal Code and under
section 3(2)(5) of the Atrocity Act and under section 135 of
the Gujarat Police Act. The accused persons pleaded not
guilty to the Charges and claimed to be tried. The
prosecution, therefore, laid evidence, oral               as well as
documentary. At the conclusion of the trial, the learned
Additional Sessions Judge was pleased to acquit the
respondent Nos.1 and 2 - original accused Nos.1 and 2 for
the charges levelled against them. Hence, the appellant -
original complainant has preferred the present Criminal
Appeal challenging the judgement and order of acquittal.
4.    Heard Mr.Chetan G. Bairwa, learned advocate for the
appellant        and Ms.C.M.   Shah,      learned     APP        for      the
5.    Mr.Bairwa, learned advocate for the appellant –
original complainant has vehemently submitted the sister of
the accused namely Pushpaben, who is examined at Ex.74,
has narrated the entire incident in her statement recorded
by the police and from which the chain of circumstances is
completed and from her statement before the police, the
case of the prosecution against the accused is proved. He
has further submitted that though the said Pushpaben is
turned hostile, her statement recorded by the police is to be
believed from which the involvement of the accused is
clearly made out on record. Her statement laid down all the
circumstances which form a chain which proves the guilt of
the accused person.
The learned advocate for the appellant has further
submitted that that the trial court has erred in acquitting
the respondent Nos.1 and 2               and not considering the
evidence on record. He has emphasized upon the point that
the real sister of the respondent No.1 Pushpaben, who had
love affair with the deceased and at the time of incident, she
was with the deceased, has narrated the entire incident in
her statement recorded by the investigating officer during
the course of the investigation, however, the trial court has
not considered the same. He has also submitted that in the
entire case, there is no   eye witnesses but the case rests
upon circumstantial evidence and circumstances are of
such nature which are pointing towards the guilt of the
accused, which is not believed by the trial court. He has
also further submitted that it was a clear case of murder of
the deceased and      postmortem has been conducted and
medical evidence has been brought on record suggesting
that the entire case is of death on account of head injuries.
He has further submitted that as per the statement of
Pushpaben, those injuries have been inflicted by the
accused by stick, which was recovered by the investigating
officer at the instance of the respondent No.1. Though the
circumstances were forming chain pointing towards the
guilt of the accused, the trial court has not believed the
same and has wrongly acquitted the respondent Nos.1 and
2. He has submitted that          considering the evidence on
record, more particularly statement of Pushpaben recorded
under section 167 of the Code of Criminal Procedure
recorded by the investigating officer, it is prayed to admit
the present appeal.
6.     Ms.C.M. Shah, learned APP for the respondent No.3 -
State has fairly conceded that the State has not preferred
any appeal against the judgement and order of acquittal.
She has submitted that appropriate order may be passed
looking to the evidence on record.
7.     Heard the leaned advocates for the respective parties
at length and perused the impugned judgement and order of
acquittal passed by the trial court as well as the entire
record and proceedings. Since the present Appeal is for
admission, we have called for the record and proceedings
vide order dated 25/07/2022.
8.    It would be worthwhile to refer to the scope in
Acquittal Appeals. It is well settled by is catena of decisions
that an appellate Court has full Power to review, re-
appreciate and consider the Evidence upon which the Order
of Acquittal is founded. However, the Appellate Court must
bear in mind that in case of Acquittal, there is prejudice in
favour of the Accused, firstly, the presumption of innocence
is available to him under the Fundamental Principle of
Criminal          Jurisprudence that every person shall                         be
presumed to be innocent unless he is proved guilty by a
competent Court of Law. Secondly, the Accused having
secured his Acquittal, the presumption of his innocence is
further reaffirmed and strengthened by the trial Court.
9.    We       have    gone    through        the entire      record          and
proceedings. We have re-appreciated the evidence on record.
On    re-appreciation       of   the     evidence,    it   appears           that
complainant Dajabhai Lumbhabhai Borika Ex.65, witness
Ramilaben Mansangbhai Harijan Ex.68, witness Laxmiben
Lumbhabhai Gharijan Ex.73, witness Ajiben Karshanbhai
Ex.77, witness Meenaben Dajabhai Boricha Ex.78, witness
Ratanben Dhanjibhai Ex.142, witness Hemiben Mansang
Boricha       –    Ex.143,   witness       Karshanbhai        Lumbhabhai
Boricha – Ex.156, witness Nanjibhai Lumbhabhai Boricha
Ex.157, witness Ruda Lumbha Dalit – Ex.161, all are
relatives and family members of the deceased and they were
residing with the deceased. All had gone to the place of
incident or at the hospital on coming to know about the
occurrence of the incident and they had seen the dead-body
of the deceased Desrabhai. All these witnesses are hearsay
witnesses. They have not seen the incident and they are not
the eye witnesses. The said witnesses have stated that they
came to know about the incident from Harijan Parbatbhai
Devjibhai.          The prosecution       has cited    said         Harijan
Parbatbhai Devjibhai as witness in the chargesheet, but he
is not examined. As per the case of the prosecution, Harijan
Parbatbhai Devjibhai had informed the Sarpanch about the
incident who is examined at Ex.59 Thus, even Harijan
Parbatbhai Devjibhai has also not seen the incident. The
witnesses have came to know about the incident from
others and their evidence is hearsay evidence which is not
permissible in the eye of law.
10.    As per the case of the prosecution, witness Hakubha
alias Ravindrasinh Rajubha Vaghela had informed Harijan
Parbatbhai Devjibhai about the incident, who is examined
at Ex.59, however, he has not supported the case of the
11.    The prosecution has examined witness Ramilaben
Mansangbhai. She was also present in the Garba when the
incident has taken place. As per her evidence, her Brother
Dhanjibhai has given her information about the incident. As
per cross examination, she is not eye witness to the incident
and police has only asked her name and age. She knows the
accused, as the accused are of her village. Nothing comes
out on record regarding motive or her being eye witness to
the incident. Her evidence is hearsay evidence.
12.   Witness Laxmiben Lubabhai – mother of the deceased
is also examined. She has stated that she came to know
about the incident through Parbatbhai Devshibhai. In her
cross examination she admits that she does not know with
whom quarrel of her son had taken place and she has no
doubt on anybody. As such her evidence is hearsay
13.   Evidence of Ajiben Karshanbhai Boricha is also
hearsay evidence. In the cross examination she has
admitted        that Parbatbhai   had     given   her      information
regarding the incident and she is unknown to the fact that
with whom quarrel of her Brother-in-law had taken place
and she also admitted that she has not stated in her
statement before the police that her Brother-in-law was
having love affair with Pushpaben and due to that reason
her Son-in-law was killed by the accused. As such, she has
also not supported the case of the prosecution.
14.    Witness Meenaben Dajabhai is also Sister-in-law of the
deceased. Her evidence is also hear-say evidence, as she has
received the information of incident through Parbatbhai.
She has admitted in her cross-examination that whatever
she has stated in her statement recorded by the police, is as
per the information received by her. She does not have any
doubt on any person. As per the statement given before the
police, she is also unknown to the fact with whom her
Brother-in-law had quarrel. She has also admitted that she
has not mentioned in her statement before the police that
her Brother-in-law was having love affair with Pushpa and
due to that the accused has murdered her Brother-in-law.
15.    Likewise, the evidence of Ratanben Dhanjibhai –
Sister-in-law of the deceased is also hearsay evidence. She
is not the eye witness.
16.    Evidence of witness Hemi Mansing Boricha- aunty of
the deceased is also hearsay evidence.
17.    Witness Karmaben Arjanbhai Patel – wife of Arjanbhai
Mavjibhai Patel has also not supported the case of the
prosecution and she is declared hostile.
18.    So far as the submission of the learned advocate for
the appellant that though Pushpaben has not supported the
case of the prosecution and is turned hostile, her statement
before the police is to be considered, is concerned, it is
pertinent to note that statement of witness recorded by the
investigating officer under section 161 of the Code of
Criminal Procedure does not fall within the ambit of
evidence as laid down in catena of decisions. Such evidence
is  only       for confrontation    in      the cross     examination.
Statement of witnesses recorded under section 161 of the
Code of Criminal Procedure being wholly inadmissible in
evidence and cannot be taken into account. As per the
settled proposition of law, statement recorded under section
161 of the Code of Criminal Procedure can be used only to
prove the contradictions and/or omissions.
Here in this case, no doubt, statement of Pushpaben
has been recorded under section 161 of the Code of
Criminal Procedure by the investigating officer during the
course of investigation, may be supporting the case of the
prosecution in her statement but deposition given by her
before the Court at Ex.74 is contrary to her statement and
in her deposition before the court, she has not supported
the case of the prosecution and she is declared hostile. The
submission of the learned advocate for the appellant that
statement of Pushpaben recorded by the investigating officer
during the course of investigation should have been taken
into account by the trial court, is not sustainable and
cannot be believed, as the evidence through the trial which
comes on record is to be appreciated in light of the provision
of Evidence Act and not the statement recorded during the
course of investigation by the investigating officer are to be
relied upon in the trial. The statements are recorded by the
investigating officer during the procedure of investigation
and thereafter whatever is stated by the witness before the
Court that becomes the evidence and in light of that
evidence, the entire case is to be evaluated. As such the
statement recorded by the investigating officer cannot take
place of evidence. Therefore, the submission of the learned
advocate for the appellant that merely on the basis of the
statement of Pushpaben recorded by the investigating
officer, entire chain of circumstances is completed and case
is proved, is not sustainable.
19.    Considering the entire evidence on record, we are of
the opinion that though the deceased has died an unnatural
death, which may be termed as homicidal death but we are
of the opinion that the prosecution has not been able to
prove the case against the accused by leading cogent and
convincing evidence on record in absence of any direct
evidence. The circumstances brought on record to form a
chain which points towards guilt of the accused only, the
prosecution has failed to prove the circumstances against
the accused.
20.    There is no eye witness and no one has seen the
deceased with the accused and there is no evidence of last
21.    There is no direct evidence against the accused and
the case rests on circumstantial evidence.               The mobile
investigation Van had Forensic Science Laboratory had had
collected various samples. There was blood stains at the
place of incident and the prosecution collected mud with
blood, control mud, slipper with blood stain, stick with
blood stain and four sticks. However, there is nothing to
connect the accused with the commission of the offence.
22.    The stick with which the injury is alleged to have been
caused has been discovered at the instance of the accused
which contains blood stains. However, the panch witness
namely Devjibhai Jethabhai Patel Ex.42 and Mahesh
Motibhai Vanand Ex.47 have been examined. The panch
witnesses of the discovery of panchnama                      have not
supported the       panchnama and they have stated that the
Muddamal has not been discovered in their presence. Even
the panch witness of the recovery of clothes of the accused
have also not supported the case of the prosecution.
23.    If the deposition of the investigating officer Ex.104 is
considered, it appears that Mohanlal Bhagvanram Khileri is
examined who         has stated that       as per the suspected
Velabhai has stated in his statement that accused has
committed murder of the deceased, however, said Velabhai
has not supported the case of the prosecution in his
deposition and he is declared hostile. Even it is not the case
of the prosecution that his statement was recorded under
section       164  of   the   Code         of Criminal       Procedure.
Investigating Officer - witness Dhirendrasinh Lakhabhai
Dodiya is examined at Ex.131, who has also not stated that
by which weapon the accused caused injury, whether there
was blood stain on        the weapon and whether there was
blood stain on the clothes of the accused. Thus, the
panchas have not supported the case of the prosecution.
Even in the panchnama of recovery of muddamal prepared
by the investigating officer, there is no mention about the
weapon and blood stain on the weapon and clothes of the
24.   As per the FSL Report, the blood group of the deceased
was “O” and the blood group of the accused was”A”                         and
“B”. As per the FSL Report, the blood group of the blood
found on the slipper, pent, shirt and underwear is of “O”
group, which is blood group of the deceased. The said
articles have been recovered after the incident and not
found from the accused. The blood group of the blood stain
found on the stick is of “O” group, however, the panch
witnesses of the discovery of the weapon stick have not
supported the case of the prosecution and they are declared
hostile.       Even investigating officer has also not stated
whether there was any blood stain on the stick or not and it
is not proved from the evidence of the investigating officer
that there was blood stain on the stick. Under the
circumstances the report of the FSL becomes insignificance.
Even the discovery of the muddamal stick is also doubtful.
Hence, on the basis of the blood stain on the stick, the
accused cannot be connected with the commission of the
alleged offence. Trilokbhai Mavjibhai Barot Ex.52 and Mehul
Shankarbhai Raval Ex.54 are the Panch witnesses of the
recovery of blood samples panchnama of accused Ishvardas
Dwarkadas Sadhu (Ramnandi) – accused No.2 – respondent
No.2, however, they have also not supported the case of the
prosecution and they are declared hostile and even no
useful information has come on record on their cross-
Discovery Panchas have also not supported the case of
the    prosecution.       As  such,       panch   witness       Devjibhai
Jethabhai          has also  not   supported      the    case        of     the
prosecution. As such the discovery panchnama which is
recovery of weapon stick at the instance of the accused
Ex.44 is not proved. Moreover, the investigating officer has
also not stated in his deposition regarding contents of
section 27 – discovery panchnama in his deposition.                          As
such, corroborative evidence of the discovery panchnama is
also brought on record by the prosecution.
25.    Considering the entire evidence on record, we are of
the opinion that the prosecution has failed to prove the case
against the accused by leading cogent and convincing
evidence. The judgement delivered by the Sessions Judge is
sound on the aspect of law and facts. The evidence brought
on record by the prosecution before the trial court has been
rightly appreciated by the trial court. No apparent error on
the face of the record is found from the judgement. The
judgement does not suffer any material defect or cannot be
said to be contrary to the evidence recorded.
26.   It may be noted that as per the settled legal position,
when two views are possible, the judgment and order of
acquittal passed by the trial Court should not be interfered
with by the Appellate Court unless for the special reasons. A
beneficial reference of the decision of the Supreme Court in
the case of State of Rajasthan versus Ram Niwas reported
in (2010) 15 SCC 463 be made in this regard. In the said
case, it has been observed as under:-
“6. This Court has held in Kalyan v. State of U.P.,
“8. The settled position of law on the powers to be
exercised by the High Court in an appeal against
an order of acquittal is that though the High Court
has full powers to review the evidence upon which
an order of acquittal is passed, it is equally well
settled that the presumption of innocence of the
accused persons, as envisaged under the criminal
jurisprudence prevalent in our country is further
reinforced by his acquittal by the trial court.
Normally the views of the trial court, as to the
credibility of the witnesses, must be given proper
weight and consideration because the trial court is
supposed to have watched the demeanour and
conduct of the witness and is in a better position to
appreciate their testimony. The High Court should
be slow in disturbing a finding of fact arrived at by
the trial court. In Kali Ram V. State of Himachal
Pradesh, (1973) 2 SCC 808, this Court observed
that the golden thread which runs through the web
of administration of justice in criminal case is that
if two views are possible on the evidence adduced
in the case, one pointing to the guilt of the accused
and the other to his innocence, the view which is
favourable to the accused should be adopted. The
Court further observed:
"27. It is no doubt true that wrongful acquittals are
undesirable and shake the confidence of the
people    in the    judicial system, much worse,
however, is the wrongful conviction of an innocent
person. The consequences of the conviction of an
innocent person are far more serious and its
reverberations cannot but be felt in a civilised
society. Suppose an innocent person is convicted of
the offence of murder and is hanged, nothing
further can undo the mischief for the wrong
resulting   from    the       unmerited    conviction            is
irretrievable. To take another instance, if an
innocent person is sent to jail and undergoes the
sentence, the scars left by the miscarriage of
justice cannot be erased by any subsequent act of
expiration. Not many persons undergoing the
pangs of wrongful conviction are fortunate like
Dreyfus to have an Emile Zola to champion their
cause and succeed in getting the verdict of guilt
annulled. All this highlights the importance of
ensuring, as far as possible, that there should be
no wrongful conviction of an innocent person.
Some risk of the conviction of the innocent, of
course, is always there in any system of the
administration of criminal justice Such a risk can
be minimised but not ruled out altogether It may in
this connection be apposite to refer to the following
observations of Sir Carleton Alien quoted on page
157 of "The Proof of Guilt" by Glanville Williams,
"I dare say some sentimentalists would assent to
the proposition that it is better that a thousand, or
even a million, guilty persons should escape than
that one innocent person should suffer; but no
responsible and practical person would accept
such a view. For it is obvious that if our ratio is
extended indefinitely, there comes a point when
the whole system of justice has broken down and
society is in a state of chaos."
28. The fact that there has to be clear evidence of
the guilt of the accused and that in the absence of
that it is not possible to record a finding of his guilt
was stressed by this Court in the case of Shivaji
Sahebrao, (1973) 2 SCC 793, as is clear from the
following observations:
"Certainly it is a primary principle that the accused
must be and not merely, may be guilty before a
court, can be convicted and the mental distinction
between 'may be' and 'must be' is long and divides
vague conjectures from sure considerations."
“9. The High Court while dealing with the appeals
against the order of acquittal must keep in mind
the following propositions laid down by this Court,
namely, (i) the slowness of the appellate court to
disturb a finding of fact; (ii) the noninterference
with the order of acquittal where it is indeed only a
case of taking a view different from the one taken
by the High Court."
8.     In  Arulvelu     and     another    versus          State
reported in (2009) 10 Supreme Court Cases 206,
the Supreme Court after discussing the earlier
judgments, observed in para No. 36 as under:
“36. Careful scrutiny of all these judgments lead to
the definite conclusion that the appellate court
should be very slow in setting aside a judgment of
acquittal particularly in a case where two views
are possible. The trial court judgment can not be
set aside because the appellate court's view is
more probable. The appellate court would not be
justified in setting aside the trial court judgment
unless it arrives at a clear finding on marshaling
the entire evidence on record that the judgment of
the trial court is either perverse or wholly
unsustainable in law.”
27.    As observed by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case
of Rajesh Singh & Others vs. State of Uttar Pradesh
reported in (2011) 11 SCC 444 and in the case of
Bhaiyamiyan Alias Jardar Khan and Another vs. State
of Madhya Pradesh reported in (2011) 6 SCC 394, while
dealing with the judgment of acquittal, unless reasoning by
the learned trial Court is found to be perverse, the acquittal
cannot be upset. It is further observed that High Court's
interference in such appeal in somewhat circumscribed and
if the view taken by the learned trial Court is possible on the
evidence, the High Court should stay its hands and not
interfere in the matter in the belief that if it had been the
trial Court, it might have taken a different view.
28.    Scope of appeal against acquittal is well laid down in
case of Chandrappa and ors. vs. State of Karnataka
reported in (2007) 4 SCC 415, it was observed:
“42.   From     the      above   decisions,          in    our
considered      view,       the   following          general
principles regarding powers of appellate Court
while dealing with an appeal against an order
of acquittal emerge;
(1) An appellate Court has full power to
review,    reappreciate        and     reconsider           the
evidence upon which the order of acquittal is
(2) The Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 puts
no   limitation,     restriction    or   condition           on
exercise of such power and an appellate Court
on the evidence before it may reach its own
conclusion, both on questions of fact and of
(3) Various expressions, such as, ’substantial
and compelling reasons’, ’good and sufficient
grounds’,      ’very        strong      circumstances’,
’distorted conclusions’, ’glaring mistakes’, etc.
are not intended to curtail extensive powers of
an appellate Court in an appeal against
acquittal. Such phraseologies are more in the
nature of ’flourishes of language’ to emphasize
the    reluctance      of   an   appellate       Court         to
interfere with acquittal than to curtail the
power of the Court to review the evidence and
to come to its own conclusion.
(4) An appellate Court, however, must bear in
mind that in case of acquittal, there is double
presumption in favour of the accused. Firstly,
the presumption of innocence available to him
under the fundamental principle of criminal
jurisprudence that every person shall be
presumed to be innocent unless he is proved
guilty by a competent court of law. Secondly,
the accused having secured his acquittal, the
presumption       of     his   innocence       is      further
reinforced, reaffirmed and strengthened by the
trial court.
(5) If two reasonable conclusions are possible
on the basis of the evidence on record, the
appellate court should not disturb the finding
of acquittal recorded by the trial court.”
29. Considering the aforesaid facts and circumstances of
the case and law laid down by the Hon'ble Supreme Court
while considering the scope of appeal under Section 378 of
the Code of Criminal Procedure, no case is made out to
interfere         with   the   impugned         judgment     and       order        of
30. In view of the above and for the reasons stated above,
present Criminal Appeal being devoid of merits, cannot be
admitted and the same deserves to be dismissed and is
accordingly dismissed in limine.
