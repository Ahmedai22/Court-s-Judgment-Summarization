The present second bail application has been filed under
Section 439 Cr.P.C. on behalf of the petitioner, who is in judicial
custody in connection with F.I.R. No.126/2015, Police Station Kuri
Bhagtasni, District Jodhpur registered for the offence punishable
under Sections 302/120-B & 201 of the IPC and Section 4/25 of
The first bail application was dismissed on 15.12.2016 by
Learned counsel for the petitioner stated that the petitioner
is a lady and she is inside jail since 02.06.2015 along with her
minor daughter, who was aged about three years at that time; and
the trial of the case is yet pending. Counsel further submits that
the trial proceedings are not being concluded on account of failure
(2 of 4)                 [CRLMB-4909/2022]
of the witnesses in appearing before the trial court. In such
circumstances, the benefit of bail may be granted to the accused-
Learned Public Prosecutor has opposed the bail application.
Heard and considered arguments advanced by learned
counsel for the petitioner and learned Public Prosecutor. Perused
the material available on record.
The Hon’ble Supreme Court in the case of Tapan Das Vs.
Union of India (Special Leave to Appeal Crl. No.5617/2021,
decided on 07.10.2021) has observed as under :-
“Taking into consideration the fact that the petitioner is
reported to be in custody since 16.10.2017 and has,
thus, suffered incarceration for around 4 years and
there is no likelihood of completion of trial in the near
future, which facts are not controverted by learned
Additional Solicitor General appearing for the Union of
India during the course of hearing, we are inclined to
grant bail to him.”
The Hon’ble Supreme Court in another case of Union of
India Vs. K.A. Najeeb in Criminal Appeal No.98 of 2021
(arising out of Special Leave Petition (Crl.) No.11616 of
2019) held as under:-
“18. It is thus clear to us that the presence of statutory
restrictions like Section 43-D (5) of UAPA per-se does
not oust the ability of Constitutional Courts to grant
bail on grounds of violation of Part III of the
Constitution. Indeed, both the restrictions under a
Statute as well as the powers exercisable under
Constitutional Jurisdiction can be well harmonised.
Whereas at commencement of proceedings. Courts are
expected to appreciate the legislative policy against
(3 of 4)                   [CRLMB-4909/2022]
grant of bail but the rigours of such provisions will melt
down where there is no likelihood of trial being
completed within a reasonable time and the period of
the prescribed sentence. Such an approach would
safeguard against the possibility of provisions like
Section 43-D (5) of UAPA being used as the sole metric
for  denial    of   bail     or     for     wholesale     breach    of
constitutional right to speedy trial.
19. Adverting to the case at hand, we are conscious of
the   fact   that   the     charges          levelled    against  the
respondent are grave and a serious threat to societal
harmony. Had it been a case at the threshold, we
would have outrightly turned down the respondent’s
prayer. However, keeping in mind the length of the
period spent by him in custody and the unlikelihood of
the trial being completed anytime soon, the High Court
appears to have been left with no other option except
to grant bail. An attempt has been made to strike a
balance between the appellant’s right to lead evidence
of its choice and establish the charges beyond any
doubt and simultaneously the respondent’s rights
guaranteed under Part III of our Constitution have
been well protected.”
It is further noteworthy that the co-ordinate Bench of this
Court in the case of “Sunil Vs. State” (S.B. Criminal Miscellaneous
4th Bail Application No.4024/2022) granted bail to the accused-
petitioner for offence under NDPS Act on the ground that he has
been suffering incarceration for more than four and a half years.
Having regard to the totality of the facts and circumstances
of the case and considering the facts that the accused-petitioner is
a lady and she is inside jail since 02.06.2015 along with her minor
daughter aged about three years and the trial of the case is yet
pending, therefore, without expressing any opinion on the merits
(4 of 4)                 [CRLMB-4909/2022]
of the case, I deem it just and proper to grant bail to the accused
petitioner under Section 439 Cr.P.C.
Accordingly, the second bail application filed under Sec.439
Cr.P.C. is allowed and it is directed that petitioner - Simorna W/o
Jitendra Vaishnav shall be released on bail in connection with
Jodhpur provided she executes a personal bond in a sum of
Rs.2,00,000/- with two sureties of Rs.1,00,000/- each to the
satisfaction of learned trial court for her appearance before that
court on each and every date of hearing and whenever called upon
to do so till the completion of the trial.
