Through the medium of instant application, the petitioner seeks stay of
order dated 10.07.2018 passed by CDPO, ICDS, Wavoora, whereunder
private respondent namely Rubeena Begum has been allowed to perform her
duties as helper in Anganwari Center, Ahangar Mohalla, Putshai as per the
Court directions passed in SWP No. 1736/2013.
The facts emerging from the application would reveal that the
applicant herein filed SWP No. 1736/2013 before this Court challenging the
order of her disengagement dated 13.07.2013 and re-engagement of the
private respondent namely Rubeena Begum. This Court while considering
the writ petition at its threshold passed an interim order on 13.09.2013 while
staying the impugned disengagement order issued against the petitioner also
directed the continuation of the petitioner as Anganwari helper till further
orders disposing of the application for interim relief.
It is revealed that the writ petition of the petitioner applicant herein
got dismissed in default on 11.04.2018 and subsequently restored on
29.06.2022 to its original number and during the intervening period, the
respondents/non-applicants seem to have issued order dated 10.07.2018, stay
of which is being sought in the instant application, whereunder the private
respondent/non-applicant above named has been allowed to perform duties
as Anganwari helper.
As emerged from the record it is not in dispute that this Court while
considering the writ petition of the petitioner passed the interim order
(supra) staying the disengagement order of the petitioner-applicant herein
inasmuch as also directed her continuation as Anganwari helper till further
orders. The said order in essence has been a final order, in that, the
application for interim relief in terms of the said order stands disposed of.
The said order having assumed finality upon disposal of the application for
interim relief as also in view of the fact that the same has not been either
thrown challenge to or else set aside in any proceedings.
It is also not in dispute that writ petition of the petitioner got
dismissed on the aforesaid date and it is also an admitted fact that the said
writ petition got restored on 29.06.2022 to its original number and as a
corollary of the restoration of writ petition to its original number all orders
passed would automatically get revived and restored to the original position.
The    respondents/non-applicants     seemingly     have   over  looked    this
fundamental aspect and misdirected themselves while issuing order dated
10.07.2018 providing wrongly therein that the said order is issued pursuant
to directions passed by the Court.
The said order patently has been issued on misappreciation of facts
and in breach of the order dated 13.09.2013 passed by this Court. The fallout
of the issuance of the order dated 10.07.2018 by the non-applicant
respondents would be rendering the petition of the petitioner infructuous
leaving nothing to be adjudicated upon by the Court upon restoration of the
petition of the petitioner.
In the aforesaid background, there seems to be substance in the instant
application carving out a case for indulgence as also an interim relief in
favour of the applicant.
Mr. Sheikh Feroz, Dy. AG, enters appearance and accepts notice on
behalf of official respondents.
Issue notice to respondent no. 6 returnable within two weeksâ€™ upon
steps within one week.
In the meanwhile, subject to objection and till next date, the operation
of impugned order dated 10.07.2018 shall stay, which shall mean that the
petitioner shall continue to work as Anganwari helper under and in terms of
order passed by this Court on 13.09.2013.
Modification, alteration, vacation on motion.
At this stage, Mr. Sheikh Feroz, Dy. AG, appearing counsel for the
official respondents/non-applicants would submit that the petitioner
applicant is continuing and has not been replaced. His statement is taken on
