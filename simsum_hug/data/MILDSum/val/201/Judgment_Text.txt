Mr. V. D. Sapkal, Senior Advocate i/b
Mr. M. K. Deshpande for Appellants
Mr. S. A. Sable, Advocate for Respondent Nos.4-A to 4-H.

Mr. S. A.P. Quadri, Advocate for Respondent Nos.2-A
13          Common Judgment in AO 15-21 & 16-21
1.      The appellants in both these appeals, who are original
respondent Nos.3/1 to 3/9 and 4/A to 4/G, have challenged the
common order dated 15/01/2021 passed by the learned District
Judge-2, Ambajogai (hereinafter referred to as 'the learned
appellate court') below Exhibits-34, 40, 44 and 80 in RCA No. 44 of
2016.     The application Exhibits-40 & 80 in RCA No. 44 of 2016
were fled by present respondent Nos.1/1 to 1/10, who are
respondent Nos. 5/1 to 5/10 in RCA No. 44 of 2016, where as
application Exhibits-34 and 44 in RCA No. 44 of 2016 were fled by
present respondent Nos.1-A and 2-A. Under the impugned order,
the learned appellate court has allowed all the applications
Exhibits-34, 40, 44 and 80 and thereby restrained the present
appellants from alienating the suit lands and for creating any third
party interest in the same till fnal disposal of the appeal.
2.      On perusal of the impugned order, it appears that the
learned appellate court by relying upon certain photographs in
respect of display of board named as 'Satwaji Nagar' on the suit
property, came to conclusion that the present appellants were
trying to create third party interest in the suit land by developing
the same into plots and it would create complications and addition
of many parties if those plots are sold.
14    Common Judgment in AO 15-21 & 16-21
3.       The learned senior counsel for the appellants strongly
submitted that the predecessor of appellants had in fact purchased
the suit land, comprising Survey No. 97 to the extent of 16 Acres
24 Gunthas, Survey No. 102 to the extent of 16 Acres 20 Gunthas
and Survey No. 134 to the extent of 19.5 Gunthas by way of
registered sale deed dated 11/10/1958 and since then the suit
land is in possession of the appellants and their forefathers. One
Gulam Dastgir had fled RCS No. 36 of 1963 for claiming 1/3rd
share in the suit land, wherein Ahemad Ali i.e. the predecessor of
present respondent No.2, was party as defendant in the said suit.
During pendency of that suit, Ahemad Ali died and therefore, his
written statement was adopted by present respondent No.2 -
Azeemunisa Begum ( in AO No.15 of 2021), who is also no more.
The suit was decided on 27/11/1972 and it was held that the
appellants are the owners of the suit land.            In the said suit,
Ahemad Ali had admitted share of the appellants in the suit land.
However, Azeemunisa Begum, despite being the party to that suit,
fled another suit bearing RCS No. 215 of 1994 alongwith Sayeeda
Begum, claiming ownership over the suit land under one
Hibanama. However, that suit was also dismissed on 20/04/2016,
against which RCA No. 44 of 2016 is pending. Not only this, but
legal heirs of Azeemunisa Begum, who are the present respondent
Nos.2-A and 2-B, had fled third suit bearing RCS No. 3 of 2001,
which was decided prior to RCS No. 215 of 1994 i.e. on
31/10/2012. In that suit, the Hibanama theory was again raised,
but it was rejected by the concerned court. The learned counsel
for the appellants, thus, submitted that in earlier three rounds of
litigation it has been established that the appellants are the
owners and possessors of the suit land since beginning and the
15            Common Judgment in AO 15-21 & 16-21
decrees of RCS No. 38 of 2016 and RCS No. 3 of 2001 have attained
fnality and therefore, the contesting respondents in the present
appeals cannot raise the point of ownership again and again. He
pointed out that earlier to passing of impugned order, the learned
appellant court had in fact rejected two applications of the
contesting respondents whereby status-quo was claimed, by
observing that the appellants are already declared owners and
possessors by the competent civil court. Thus, he fnally submits
that there should be an end to the litigation which is being fought
by third generation of the contesting parties and requested to allow
the appeals by setting aside the impugned order.
4.      On the contrary, the learned counsel for the contesting
respondent Nos. 2-A and 3-A, who are the legal heirs of
Azeemunisa Begum and Sayeeda Begum i.e. original respondent
Nos.2 & 3, strongly opposed the submissions made on behalf of
the appellants. He pointed out that earlier applications for status-
quo fled by the contesting respondents, were not decided on
merits but those were rejected being unattended. He submits that
if the impugned order is set aside, then the appellants will
defnitely sell the suit land, which will                     give rise to more
complications          and       may  defeat right   of     present             contesting
respondents. He also pointed out as to how the sale deed dated
11/10/1958 executed in favour of predecessor of the appellants,
was void-abinitio.              He further submits that principle of res
judicata is not at all applicable to the applications for claiming stay
to the alienation as every such application can be made on fresh
cause of action and by considering the change in circumstances.
He pointed out that the suit land was in fact in possession of the
16              Common Judgment in AO 15-21 & 16-21
Government and not of the appellants.                 As such, he prayed for
dismissal of the appeals.                  In alternative, he submits that
expeditious hearing and disposal of appeals is already directed.
5.      On the other hand, the learned counsel for respondent
Nos.3-A to 3-D in A.O. No. 16 of 2021 submitted that an
appropriate order might be passed.
6.      With the assistance of the learned counsel for rival parties, I
have gone through the entire documents produced by the rival
parties on record alongwith the impugned order.                         The respective
learned counsel for the contesting parties have also relied on
certain judgments, which I would like to discuss at appropriate
stage hereinafter.
7.      On going through the impugned order in both these appeals,
which is commonly passed by the learned appellate court below
Exhibits-34, 40, 44 and 80, it is evident that present respondent
Nos.2-A to 2-B and 3 as well as the legal representatives of 1/1 to
1/10      have     fled      these   applications   restraining             the       present
appellants, who are the legal heirs of Umaji Satwaji Shep and
Madhavrao Satwaji Shep, from creating third party rights over the
suit land and alienating the same till fnal disposal of the appeal.
The     learned       senior     counsel   for  the   appellants              vehemently
submitted that despite there was bar under the principle of res-
judicata the learned appellate court decided all these applications
for seeking temporary injunction in favour of the original
appellants and legal representatives of original respondent No.5 in
the appeal.        He pointed out that earlier also respondent No.2-A
17           Common Judgment in AO 15-21 & 16-21
had fled application below Exhibit-56 in the appeal before the
learned appellate court for grant of status-quo pertaining to the
suit property and the same was rejected on 20/02/2020 by the
learned appellate court. He further pointed out that thereafter, the
present respondent No.3-A had also fled similar application for
maintaining status-quo by the present appellants below Exhibit-64
before the learned appellate court, but that application was also
rejected on 14/12/2020. Thus, the learned senior counsel for the
appellants submitted that there was a bar for the learned appellate
court to decide the subsequent applications for similar relief,
specially when earlier applications to that effect, were rejected. He
also placed reliance on the judgment of Hon'ble Apexc Court in
case of Arjun Singh vs. Mohindra Kumar and others, reported in
AIR 1964 SC 993, wherein it is held as under :
" Scope of the principle of res judicata is not
confned to what is contained in Section 11 but
is of more general application.             Again, res
judicata could be as much applicable to
different stages of the same suit as to fndings
on issues in different suits. If the Court which
rendered the frst decision was competent to
entertain the suit or other proceeding, and had
therefore, competency to decide the issue or
matter, the circumstance that it is a tribunal of
exclusive jurisdiction or one from whose
decision no appeal lay would not by themselves
negative the fnding on the issue by it being res
judicata in later proceedings.             Where the
principle of res judicata is invoked in the case
of the different stages of proceedings in the
same suit, the nature of the proceedings, the
scope of the enquiry which the adjectival law
provides for the decision being reached, as well
as the specifc provisions made on matters
touching such decision are some of the
18             Common Judgment in AO 15-21 & 16-21
material and relevant factors to be considered
before the principle is held applicable".
8.       On the contrary, the learned counsel for the contesting
respondents          in     the    present  appeals    strongly            opposed     the
submissions made on behalf of the appellants in respect of bar
under the principle of res-judicata.
9.       Admittedly, as per the observations of the Hon'ble Apex
Court, the principle of res-judicata is not confned to what is
contained in Section 11 of the CPC but it also applies to the
different stages of the same proceedings.                     The learned senior
counsel for the appellants is relying on the rejection of similar
applications claiming status-quo against the appellants. However,
on going through the orders below those applications at Exhibits-
56 and 64 it is evident that those applications were fled only to get
restraining order till decision of applications below Exhibits-34 and
44, which are now decided under the impugned order in this
appeal.       The learned appellate court has specifcally observed in
the orders passed on the application below Exhibits-56 & 64 that
the then pending applications for restraining relief, were to be
decided on merit and therefore, he was not inclined to grant relief
of status-quo in those applications. As such, nothing was decided
on merit by the learned appellate court while rejecting the
applications below Exhibits-56 & 64.               As such, there cannot be
any      bar for the            learned  appellate   court for deciding the
applications for grant of temporary injunction by way of the
impugned order subsequently.
19        Common Judgment in AO 15-21 & 16-21
10.     On perusal of the impugned order, it is evident that the
learned appellate court has restrained the appellants from
alienating the suit land or creating any third party interest over the
same till fnal disposal of the appeal mainly on the basis of some
photographs fled by contesting respondents, wherein one board
showing name of Satwaji Nagar was erected on the suit land,
which was divided into plots by stone markings.                               Further,
Tahsildar, Ambajogai had also issued one letter mentioning that
action would be taken against the persons who had erected that
board.      Ultimately, the learned appellate court found that there
was possibility of alienation of the suit land during pendency of
the appeal and therefore, the impugned order was passed.
However, it is settled position that the temporary injunction of any
nature can be granted if the three things namely prima facie case,
balance of convenience and irreparable loss are established by a
person seeking such injunction. It is also settled that unless and
until all these three things are established, no injunction can be
granted. Moreover, it is also settled by the Hon'ble Apex Court in
various judgments that a party who has suppressed the material
facts from the record while obtaining favourable relief, can be
thrown out at any stage of proceeding. In view of the same, I have
to verify whether the original appellants and the legal heirs of
original respondent No.5 in RCA No. 44 of 2016, have established
the three important things for seeking relief in their favour. It has
also to be seen whether there is any suppression of material facts
by the persons, who are claiming the relief of temporary injunction
against the present appellants.
20       Common Judgment in AO 15-21 & 16-21
11.     On going through the plaint in RCS No. 215 of 1994 it is
evident that Azeemunisa Begum and Sayeda Begum, who were the
daughters of one Ahemad Ali, have claimed that they be put in
Khas possession of the suit property i.e. eastern 1/2 portion of
Survey Nos.97, 102 and 134 by dispossessing the defendants or
any other person found in possession of those lands. In the said
suit Azeemunisa Begum and Sayeda Begum had made their real
brothers Munawar Ali and Habeeb Ali as party defendant Nos.1
and 2 and also present appellants and legal heirs of Gulam
Mohamood s/o Gulam Dastgir Saheb and others as remaining
defendants.         On perusal of the plaint itself, it appears that
daughters of Ahemad Ali namely Azeemunisa Begum and Sayeda
Begum had claimed that their father Ahemad Ali orally gifted the
suit property to them on 04/03/1957 and thereafter executed an
agreement of memorandum of oral gift on 05/04/1957 to that
effect and therefore, on the basis of said oral gift they became
owners of the suit property.
12.     On the contrary, the present appellants had resisted the suit
by fling written statement mentioning that they had in fact
purchased the suit property from father of Azeemunisa Begum and
Sayeda Begum by way of a registered sale deed dated 11/10/1958
through their predecessor Umaji and Madhav for consideration of
Rs.3,000/- alongwith proportionate share in well and four mango
trees. They contended that the present original respondent Gulam
Dastgir s/o Abdul Quadar had fled suit bearing RCS No. 36 of
1963, wherein deceased Ahemad Ali during his life time had
admitted the fact of the aforesaid sale deed and after that
Azeemunisa Begum and Sayeda Begum also admitted the same
21             Common Judgment in AO 15-21 & 16-21
without raising any objection on the ground of the aforesaid
Hibanama (oral gift). The appellants have also produced various
documents in support of their claim in the written statement in
RCS No. 215 of 1994.
13.     The judgment in RCS No. 36 of 1963 indicates that there
were three shares in lands bearing Survey Nos. 97, 102 and 134,
situated at village Shepwadi. One Gulam Mohmood Gulam Dastgir
and Gulab Gaus Abdul Quadar were having share to the extent of
25% each and one Ahmed Ali Mohmad Munawar Ali, who was
father of Azeemunisa Begum and Sayeda Begum, was having
eastern side half share.            The predecessor of appellants by name
Satwaji was possessing those entire lands since prior to 1956.
However, in the year 1958 Ahmed Ali sold his half share in those
lands towards eastern side, that means the suit properties to
original defendant Nos.3 & 4 i.e. Umaji Satwaji Shep and
Madhavrao Satwaji Shep by way of registered sale deed dated
11/10/1958.            However, thereafter as per the provisions of
Hyderabad Tenancy Act, 1950 under Section 98-C, Umaji and
Madhavrao paid the required fne and validated earlier sale deed
on 19/12/1960. Therefore, since 1958, Umaji and Madhavrao were
in possession of the suit properties.             However, Gulam Dastgir
thereafter fled RCS No. 36 of 1963 against Umaji and Madhav and
others for partition and separate possession of his 1/4 share
towards western side in the aforesaid lands.                The record further
shows that Ahemad Ali who was party to that suit, had fled
written statement in the said suit and thereby agreed that he had
sold the suit property to Umaji and Madhav by way of registered
sale deed, which was validated thereafter under the order dated
22        Common Judgment in AO 15-21 & 16-21
19/12/1960 passed by Tahasildar, Ambajogai under Section 98-C
of the Hyderabad Tenancy Act in File No.409 of 1959 as required
permission for the sale deed was not sought at the relevant time.
It is extremely important to note that during pendency of that suit,
Ahmed Ali died in the year 1969 and therefore, his legal heirs were
brought on record. The name Azeemunisa Begum was shown as
Abeda Begum in the said suit being the legal heirs of deceased
Ahmed Ali. Moreover, Sayeda begum was also party to that suit. It
is to be noted that Azeemunisa Begum and Sayeda Begum
alongwith other legal heirs of Ahemad Ali, had adopted written
statement earlier fled by Ahemad Ali and as such, they admitted
the fact of selling the suit land to Umaji and Madhav.                         Thus, it
clearly indicates that Azeemunisa Begum and Sayeda Begum did
not raise any objection by mentioning that there was an oral gift in
their favour in respect of the suit properties by their father
Ahemad Ali. On the contrary, they admitted the fact that the suit
properties were sold to the Umaji and Madhav vide registered sale
deed dated 11/10/1958, which was also validated thereafter in due
14.      It further reveals that though Umaji and Madhav were in
possession of the suit properties since 1958 but the plaintiffs and
other defendants in RCS No. 36 of 1963 lodged false proceeding
under Section 145 of Cr.P.C. to deprive Umaji and Madhav of the
suit lands.          Those persons by joining hands with concerned
authorities, caused the suit lands to be forfeited by Government as
per the order dated 25/04/1991 passed by concerned Taluka
Magistrate. However, Umaji and Madhav had challenged the said
decision by fling Revision No. 40 of 1991 before Additional
23             Common Judgment in AO 15-21 & 16-21
Collector, Ambajogai and the same was allowed on 05/08/1991
and the earlier decision of Tahsildar dated 25/04/1991 was
quashed and set aside.               Against the said order of Additional
Collector, Ambajogai, an Appeal No. 185 of 1991 was fled against
Umaji and Madhav by those plaintiffs and other defendants. But
this court rejected the said appeal vide order dated 20/07/1992.
Thus, it is evident that the suit properties were in possession of
Government from 1976 till 15/07/1994. Since after the order of
this court, the Executive Magistrate, Ambajogai passed order dated
29/06/1994 and gave actual possession of the suit properties to
Umaji and Madhav on 15/07/1994 under panchanama and
possession receipt.              Thus, it is clearly evident that the suit
properties were never in possession of Azeemunisa Begum and
Sayeda Begum but it was in possession of Umaji and Madhav from
1956 to 1976 and thereafter from 15/07/1994 till today. It is also
evident that 1/4th share each in the land Survey No.97, 102 and
134 was given to respective fathers of original defendant Nos.5 & 6
as well as original defendant Nos.7 to 9 in the execution
proceeding No. 6 of 1973 fled as per the decree in RCS No.36 of
1963 on 13/01/1973.
15.     It is extremely important to note that this court in Criminal
Writ Petition No. 410 of 1997 fled by legal heirs of Gulam Dastgir
and Habeeb Ali i.e. son of Ahmed Ali, has made following
10. At this juncture, I would like to mention that the
second party had claimed actual possession of
the landed property in Regular Civil Suit No. 272
of 1973 and the competent civil court granted
this relief in favour of the second party. In view
24             Common Judgment in AO 15-21 & 16-21
of this position, the party No.1 cannot claim
possession of the disputed lands. Certain orders
were passed by the Executive Magistrate in the
past because that time, circumstances justifed
to take action under section 145 Criminal
Procedure Code.         But after fnalization of
proprietary rights in favour of the second party,
the position becomes different. It is the second
party who has got legal right to possess the
disputed lands.       Under the circumstance, it
cannot be said that the Executive Magistrate
should restore the disputed lands to party No.1
on the ground that the question of title or
ownership is unknown to the proceedings under
11. The cases relied upon by Shri Khader, learned
counsel can very well be distinguished on facts.
The cases relied upon by Shri Khader, learned
counsel, do not come to the rescue of Party No.1.
It is true that on the background of pendency of
civil litigation for possession, the Executive
Magistrate should not have initiated a parallel
criminal proceeding under Section 145 Criminal
Procedure Code. In the civil court, the parties
were in a position to obtain interim orders such
as injunction or appointment of receiver for the
purpose of protection of the disputed property
during pendency of the civil litigation. But
simply because wrong is committed by the
Executive Magistrate in the matter of initiation of
proceedings under Section 145 Criminal
Procedure Code on the background of pendency
of civil suit, it cannot be said that the Executive
Magistrate should now ignore the ultimate relief
granted by civil court in favour of second party
and direct restoration of possession to Party
No.1. The decree of civil court for possession has
achieved fnality in law and therefore, the
Executive Magistrate is bound to obey the decree
of civil court.
12. The civil court has settled the rights of second
party and as a consequence thereof, the actual
possession of the disputed lands should go to
25          Common Judgment in AO 15-21 & 16-21
the second party.      Directing restoration of
possession in favour of Party No.1 by Executive
Magistrate would be an abuse of process of the
court."
Thus from the aforesaid observations of this court it is clearly
evident that the civil court had already settled right of Umaji and
Madhav being the owner of the suit properties and therefore,
refused to entertain the aforesaid criminal writ petition. Not only
this but the Executive Magistrate while passing order dated
29/06/1994 had observed that Umaji and Madhav had purchased
the suit properties vide registered sale deed by referring all the
earlier civil proceedings bearing RCS Nos. 36 of 1963, 272 of 1973,
40 of 1991, 41 of 1991, Appeal No.6 of 1980 and order of this court
in Proceeding No.185 of 1991.
16.     It is extremely important to note that Azeemunisa Begum and
Sayeda Begum, who have fled the original appeal RCA No. 44 of
2016 on rejection of their RCS No. 215 of 1994, were parties in suit
bearing RCS No. 36 of 1963, wherein civil rights of Umaji and
Madhav were crystallized by the competent civil court and they
had also admitted the position that the suit properties were sold
by their father to Umaji and Madhav by way of registered sale deed
dated 11/10/1958 after being impleaded in the suit and by
adopting the written statement of Ahmed Ali. It is also important
to note that though Azeemunisa Begum and Sayeda Begum were
party to that suit, they suppressed the entire earlier proceedings
and even the observations of this court in respect of creation of
legal right by Umaji and Madhav over the suit properties while
fling the subsequent suit bearing RCS No. 215 of 1994.                           This
26          Common Judgment in AO 15-21 & 16-21
suppression of material facts by Azeemunisa Begum and Sayeda
Begum needs to be taken seriously and they can even be thrown
out from the proceeding for that reason as per the observation of
Hon'ble Apex Court in so many judgments that fraud vitiates
17.     The learned counsel for respondent Nos.1/1 to 1/10 relied
upon various judgments as follows :
1)    Wander Ltd. and another vs. Antox India P. Ltd,
2)    Maharwal Khewaji Trust (Regd.) Faridkot vs.
3)    Sunil s/o Madanlal Agrawal vs. Jawaharlal s/o
Nandlal Chittarke, 2012(2) Mh.L.J.254 and
4)    Prakash Ahuja vs. Ganesh Dhonde and others,
It has been observed in the above judgments that the nature
of the property cannot be permitted to be changed and for avoiding
multiplicity of proceedings, temporary injunction has to be granted
for restraining further alienation during pendency of appeal or
proceeding. It has also been observed in the aforesaid judgments
that discretion exercised by the lower court is not to be interfered
with in appeal. However, all these observations will be applicable
to the party who has come with clean hands before the court. It is
a principle of law that who seeks equity, must do the same.
However, in this case, the record prima facie indicates that
ownership of Umaji and Madhav over the suit properties was
established twice in the earlier proceedings which remained
unchallenged and thereby attained fnality.               Further, by giving
complete go-bye to the earlier proceedings, Azeemunisa Begum and
Sayeda Begum fled another suit knowing well that Umaji and
27             Common Judgment in AO 15-21 & 16-21
Madhav were declared owner of the suit properties by competent
civil courts, suppressed those earlier proceedings and came with
concocted story of oral gift, which has been negatived by the trial
18.      Further, it is also extremely important to note that the earlier
dispute was between Satwaji i.e. father of Umaji and Madhav and
the earlier owners of the suit properties.                Thereafter, Umaji and
Madhav         continued          the  proceedings    and       established            their
ownership over the suit properties. Now their next generation is
fghting for getting fruits of earlier decrees.                 Likewise, the third
generation of original owner Ahmed Ali has continued the litigation
despite it has already been established that Ahmed Ali had sold
the suit properties. Under such circumstances, I do not fnd that
there is prima facie case established by Azeemunisa Begum and
Sayeda Begum. Per contra, it appears that they have suppressed
the earlier proceedings despite being party to it and fled RCS
No.215 of 1994 on account of new ground of alleged oral gift
theory. It is also important to note that if the injunction granted
by the learned appellate court is allowed to be continued further,
then there will be no end to the present litigation and it will
continue for indefnite period leaving the appellants deprived from
getting fruits of earlier proceedings.           Thus, it has been revealed
that twice it has been established by the competent civil court that
Umaji and Madhav were owners of the the suit properties and the
said fact remained unchallenged. There should be an end to the
litigation specially when the fnding of competent civil court
determining the legal ownership of Umaji and Madhav over the suit
28         Common Judgment in AO 15-21 & 16-21
19.     Therefore, considering all these facts, I come to the
conclusion that the learned appellate court has wrongly restrained
the appellants from alienating the suit properties till decision of
appeal only on the basis of certain display board and by ignoring
the vital ingredients required for granting equitable relief of
temporary injunction. The record clearly shows that Azeemunisa
Begum and Sayeda Begum failed to establish prima facie case in
their favour for securing the temporary injunction as prayed.
Moreover, they have also suppressed the earlier proceedings while
fling RCS No.215 of 1994. It is to be noted here that there was no
injunction of any kind was running against the present appellants
during pendency of the suit.        In fact, Azeemunisa Begum and
Sayeda Begum despite fling the application for grant of temporary
injunction in the suit, did not press the same and requested to the
trial court to hear the same alongwith the suit. It is signifcant to
note that the advocate for the present appellants had in fact made
statement before the trial court that the appellants would not
alienate the suit properties till the decision of the suit. Thus, on
dismissal of the suit, the said statement also become useless and
it can not be considered as a ground for granting further
injunction in favour of Azeemunisa Begum and Sayeda Begum. By
considering all these aspects, I certainly fnd that the learned
appellate court has defnitely erred in restraining defendant Nos.3
& 4 namely, Umaji and Madhav and their legal representatives,
who are the appellants in this appeal from alienating the suit
properties and creating third party interest thereon till fnal
disposal of the appeal. As such, the impugned order is liable to be
quashed and set aside.
29           Common Judgment in AO 15-21 & 16-21
20.      After the impugned order in these appeals is quashed and set
aside, the learned counsel for the respondent Nos. 2A and 3A
requested for continuation of impugned order for certain period
since he wants to challenge the order of this Court before
Honourable Supreme Court. The learned counsel Mr. Niranjan M.
Deshpande, holding for Mr. M. K. Deshpande, the learned counsel
for appellants, strongly opposed the submission made on behalf of
respondent Nos. 2A and 3A.
21.      Since the learned appellate Court i.e. District Court at
Ambejogai had granted relief in favour of respondents and thereby
restrained the present appellants from alienating the suit property
till disposal of appeal and the respondents now want to challenge
the order of this Court setting aside the said order, the said order
can be continued for certain period considering the ensuing Diwali
Vacation which starts from tomorrow. Accordingly following order
is passed.
1.       Both       the  appeals are allowed and                 the
impugned common order dated 15/01/2021
passed by the learned appellate court i.e.
District Judge-2, Ambajogai in RCA No.44 of
2016 below applications Exhibits-34, 40, 44
and 80 is quashed and set aside.
30            Common Judgment in AO 15-21 & 16-21
2.       Both the appeals are accordingly disposed of.
3.       Pending civil applications, if any, accordingly
stand disposed of.
4.       The order of learned appellate Court i.e. the
impugned        order  in these       appeals              is
continued for further period of four weeks.
