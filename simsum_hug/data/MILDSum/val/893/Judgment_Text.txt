Heard finally by consent of learned counsel for the parties.
2.           The challenge raised in the present writ petition is to
the communication dated 30.12.2022 issued by the Water Supply
and Sanitation Department of the State Government. By the said
communication addressed to the Chief Executive Officer, Zilla
Parishad, Nagpur it has been informed that the proposal for
blacklisting the petitioner is under consideration. Based on this
communication one of the bids of the petitioner has been held
non-responsive and the petitioner is not being permitted to
participate in the other bids pursuant to the tender notice floated
by respondent No.2. The Zilla Parishad had issued tender notice
inviting bids for about 10 works. The petitioner responded to the
said invitation and submitted its bid.         As regards the work
No.2022_NAGPU_857690_2 the petitioner’s bid was not
opened on the ground that the instructions from the State
Government in the matter of blacklisting the petitioner were
awaited.     The financial bids of the other works were yet to be
opened when this writ petition was filed praying that the
petitioner be permitted to participate in the tender process since
there is no order of blacklisting passed.
3.           Mr. Abhay Sambre, the learned counsel for the
petitioner has invited our attention to relevant clauses of the
tender document.         As per Clause 15 if a Contractor is
blacklisted / barred from participating in a tender or his
registration is suspended, he is liable to be disqualified. A bidder
is required to submit a self declaration that he is not blacklisted by
any Government Department / Government Local Body or
Government Undertaking. Since there is no order of blacklisting
as on date it is submitted that the petitioner has submitted such
undertaking.     Merely on the basis that it is proposed to be
blacklisted, the petitioner cannot be prevented from participating
in the tender process. In support of his contention the learned
counsel has placed reliance on the decision in the case of Caretel
Ors. reported in 2019 (14) SCC 81. It is submitted that the
petitioner be permitted to accordingly participate in the tender
4.           Mr. P.K. Sathianathan, the learned counsel for
respondent Nos.2 and 3 opposed writ petition.        He submitted
that in view of communication received by the Zilla Parishad on
30.12.2022 as the process of blacklisting the petitioner was under
way the petitioner was not qualified to participate in the tender
process. There were about three crimes registered against the
petitioner and considering the seriousness of the same action of
the Zilla Parishad was justified in debarring the petitioner.
Attention was invited to the Government Resolution dated
7.12.2021 and especially clauses 2.2., 2.9 and 2.15 thereof to
sustain the action. Placing reliance on the decision in the case of
N.G. Projects Limited V/s. Vinod Kumar Jain and others reported
in (2022) 6 SCC 127 it is submitted that this Court should be
slow in interfering in matters of such nature. The learned counsel,
therefore, submits that no relief can be granted to the petitioner.
5.            On hearing the learned counsel for the parties and
perusing the documents on record it is undisputed that as on date
there is no order of blacklisting passed against the petitioner. The
process to blacklist the petitioner is stated to be under
consideration of the concerned authority. It is in that backdrop
the reliance is placed on the Government Resolution dated
7.12.2021.     While there can be no quarrel with the proposition
that in an appropriate case the action of blacklisting may be
justified, it is to be kept in mind unless there is an order of
blacklisting, a bidder is entitled to participate in the tender
process unhindered.      The declaration which a bidder has to
submit is an undertaking that an order of blacklisting / bar from
participating in the tender process has not been passed against
him.      This presupposes that an order of blacklisting is in
existence. The same is not the case in hand. Even according to
the Zilla Parishad the proposal for blacklisting the petitioner is
pending with the State Government. Thus in absence of any
order of blacklisting being suffered by the petitioner it cannot be
prevented from participating in the tender process on that
ground.     In para 24 of the decision in Caretel Infotech Ltd.
(supra) it has been observed as under:-
another perspective. Blacklisting has very serious
consequences. A show cause notice may result in
blacklisting or may not result in blacklisting. The
mere show cause notice being issued, to visit such a
severe consequence on a bidder, may be difficult to
sustain.”
6.           The decision in N.G. Projects Limited (supra) refers
to the parameters for interfering while exercising jurisdiction
under Article 226 of the Constitution of India in tender matters.
The aforesaid decision has been subsequently explained in the
case of Jai Bholenath Construction V/s. The Chief Executive
Officer, Zilla Parishad, Nanded and others (Civil Appeal
No.4140/2022 decided on 18.5.2022) by holding that where
there has been arbitrary exercise of power in rejecting a bid,
interference could be justified.
7.           We, therefore, find that in the present case as there is
no order blacklisting the petitioner, the Zilla Parishad was not
justified in restraining the petitioner from participating in the
tender process on that count.
8.           For aforesaid reasons, it is held that petitioner is
entitled to participate in the tender process pursuant to the bids
submitted by it. The Zilla Parishad shall consider the petitioner’s
bid in accordance with the tender notice and its bids shall not be
rejected only in view of the communication dated 30.12.2022.
Needless to state that if in future the petitioner is blacklisted the
respondents are free to consider that aspect in accordance with
9.           Writ petition is allowed in the above terms.       Rule
accordingly. No costs.
10.        An authenticated copy of judgment be given to the
learned counsel for the parties.
