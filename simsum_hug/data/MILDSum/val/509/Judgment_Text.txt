2.      Mr. Satyendra Kumar Rai, learned counsel for the applicants, while
arguing the aforesaid bail applications has drawn the attention of the Court
to the complaint dated 16.04.2021 given on behalf of the Archaeological
Survey of India, Sub Circle, Tughlaqabad, New Delhi to the SHO, Police
Station Govind Puri in relation to encroachment on the ASI land as well as
installing of statue of Baba Sahab Shri Bhim Rao Ambedkar in the night. He
submits that a similar complaint was also given by the applicant Jitender to
the SHO, Police Station Govind Puri. He further submits that the present
complaint filed by the complainant Chander Pal Singh is in fact motivated,
on account of a land dispute which has been pending between the parties. In
this regard, he has referred to earlier proceedings including FIR No.
277/2013 registered under Sections 447 IPC & Sections 19/30/32 of the
Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Sites and Remains Act, 1958 at
Police Station Govind Puri, Delhi against the present complainant. He has
also referred to FIR No. 933/2013 registered under Sections 354(B)/323 IPC
at Police Station Govind Puri, Delhi at the instance of the applicant Smt.
Shakuntla Devi against the complainant. It is also submitted that the
complainant had earlier lodged an FIR bearing No. 454/2015, registered
under Sections 3(1)(2)/3(1)(10) of the Schedule Castes & Schedule Tribes
(Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989, against one of the applicants alongwith
others which later on came to be quashed on the basis of settlement. He has
also referred to the proceedings under Sections 107/150 Cr.P.C. pending
between the parties. Learned counsel submits that the land with respect to
which the applicant Jitender had submitted the complaint belongs to
Archaeological Survey of India and the complainant by installing the statue
of Baba Sahab Shri Bhim Rao Ambedkar was in fact trying to encroach upon
the land. He argues that the ingredients of the alleged offence are not made
out and in this regard has referred to the decision of the Supreme Court in
Hitesh Verma v. State of Uttarakhand and Another reported as (2020) 10
SCC 710. It is submitted that a reading of the FIR would not show that any
caste-based remarks were hurled at any particular person. It is also
submitted that in the FIR only the word ‘Chamako’ has been mentioned.
3.     Learned APP for the State, duly assisted by learned counsel for the
complainant, has vehemently opposed the bail applications. She has referred
to the Status Report to submit that in the present case the incident occurred
on Independence Day, when the complainant alongwith others had gone to
hoist the national flag near the statue of Baba Sahab Shri Bhim Rao
Ambedkar installed in a plot. She submits that the applicants have not only
hurled caste-based remarks but also outraged the modesty of women as well
as caused injuries to others. She further submits that in consequence of the
incident, eight persons were injured whose MLCs were collected from
AIIMS Hospital. It is informed that there were nine victims in total. It is
submitted that the applicants also piled up cow dung and garbage near the
statue of Baba Sahab Shri Bhim Rao Ambedkar, as a result of which Section
3(1)(t) of the SC/ST is also attracted in the present case. Learned APP
submits that after the incident, the crime team reached the spot and
photographed the place of incident, where it is clearly visible that cow dung
and garbage were piled up near the statute of Baba Sahab Shri Bhim Rao
Ambedkar. It is submitted that during investigation, the Investigating Officer
also came across a video clip, which has captured the incident. By the said
footage, the version of the victims is stated to have been corroborated and
the presence of all the four accused persons at the spot recorded. It is
informed that the investigation is still pending.
4.     I have heard learned counsels for the parties and perused the material
placed on record.
5.     In Prathvi Raj Chauhan v. Union of India and Others reported as
(2020) 4 SCC 727, it has been observed that an anticipatory bail application
with respect to offence under the SC/ST Act is maintainable provided the
ingredients of the offence are not made out from a reading of the FIR.
6.      The ingredients of offence under Section 3(1)(r) [earlier Section
3(1)(x) of the SC/ST Act] are (i) intentional insult or intimidation with intent
to humiliate a member of a Scheduled Caste or a Scheduled Tribe and (ii)
the incident ought to have occurred in ‘public view’. In the present case, the
prosecution case is that the victims had gone to the place of incident to hoist
the national flag on the occasion of Independence Day. However, the
applicants prevented the victims from hoisting the flag, outraged the
modesty of certain women, hurled caste-specific abuses, defiled the statue of
Baba Sahab Shri Bhim Rao Ambedkar installed in the plot and caused
injuries to the victims. The alleged incident is further stated to have occurred
in a place that was open to public view, where members of public were also

victims including the eight injured are not part of one family.

applicants on bail. The bail applications are accordingly dismissed as not

an expression on the merits of the case and shall not have a bearing on the
trial of the case.
