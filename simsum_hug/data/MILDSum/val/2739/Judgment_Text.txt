Two affidavits have been filed before us.
The first affidavit is filed by the Registrar
General of the High Court of Odisha in respect of
the steps taken for providing virtual access which
would obviate the need for any Benches. There are 30
district Courts functioning in the State of Odisha
and   the  status   report   qua  computerization  to
facilitate the functioning in the District Courts
and Taluka Courts has been enclosed. The details of
equipments which have been purchased have been set
out. The e-Filing Version 3.0 stands implemented from
02.04.2022   and   a  total    of   4382   Advocates   have
registered on the e-Filing Portal of this Version
and  11290  cases   have  been    filed  through   e-Filing
Portal in the District Courts.        Virtual court rooms
have been established in the various districts and
proceedings are being conducted as per Odisha High
which would facilitate a witness to appear in any
Court including the High Court of Odisha from any
district of the State or from any remote area in
accordance   with   the  Standard     Operating   Procedure
(SOP). Technical persons have been appointed. The
High Court of Odisha is functioning on hybrid mode
and  links  are   published.      Hands  on   training  for
judicial officers, Advocates and Advocates’ clerks
are being conducted. That should have taken care of
the needs of access to justice.
There is, however, something more to it!
The conduct of the Advocates as reflected in the
supplementary   affidavit    filed    by  the   High  Court
leaves us with little doubt that there are many so-
called Advocates enrolled at the Bar whose bread and
butter is obviously not this profession.          After the
order was passed by us on 14.11.2022, the same was
circulated to all the Bar Associations through their
respective      District        Judges.      Despite      our
observations,      agitation       and    picketing      etc.
The matter deteriorated to a stage where the
District   Judge,    Khurda     at   Bhubaneswar    received
reports about violent obstruction to the judicial
officers,   staff   and   litigants    by  members    of  the
Bhubaneswar    Bar   Association     restraining    them   in
entering   court   building    on   25.11.2022.    In   fact,
after receiving reliable information, the District
Judge had sought for police protection for judicial
officers,   staff   and   litigants.     300/400   Advocates
obstructed   them   when   staff    and   officers   reached
there and police personnel reached at about 11 a.m.
But even under police protection, the Bar members
prevented access by violently obstructing them.           The
District    Judge    also     reported    that    no    prior
information was given to him by the Bar Association
regarding such picketing on 25.11.2022.
It is, however, averred that the District Judge,
Koraput,    Jeypore    enclosed     the   extract    of   the
resolution District Bar Association, Jeypore dated
24/25.11.2022    indicating    the   decision   to  withdraw
their    earlier     resolution       for    strike     dated
There is then an additional affidavit of the
Registrar stating that several Bar Associations of
State of Odisha continue to abstain from work and
have indulged in boycott, picketing etc. during the
month of October, 2022 and also in November, 2022.
The judicial work in least 20 districts continued to
be hampered in the month of October, 2022 and 3216
cumulative judicial working hours have been lost.
The  District  Judge,   Sambalpur   intimated  that
members of the District Bar Association, Sambalpur
staged a picketing on demand of establishment of the
permanent Bench of Odisha in Western Odisha and even
refused to attend a meeting called by the District
A  similar  approach   has   been  adopted  by  the
Baramba Bar Association as per the District Judge,
Cuttack. Position is no different of others.
We had already cautioned the Bar Associations on
many occasions in the earlier main order as well as
on  the  last  date  that   if  they   fail  to  conduct
themselves as members of the noble profession, they
loose any protection. They have done everything to
invite what we are required to now direct to uphold
the majesty of law and direct the working of the
Courts functional.
We  may  also  notice   that   the  Central  Action
Committee has filed an affidavit.        We notice from
Annexure   R-1   to  it   that    the    President   of  the
Sambalpur Bar Association is actually the President
of the Central Action Committee.
If the leaders of the Bar Associations in Odisha
seek to invite harsh action, we will have to oblige
The Bar Council of India is represented before
us.   We would expect the Bar Council of India to
take appropriate action against all the            executive
members  of    different   Bar   Associations     on  strike
contrary to directions of this Court and logically
we would expect their licences to be suspended at
least till the work is resumed and further action
against the members of the Action Committee.
We would expect the police to provide foolproof
arrangements for ingress and egress of not only the
judicial officers but all willing members of the Bar
and the litigants who would be entitled to contest
their own proceedings.      Necessary prohibitory orders
be  issued    around  the    areas    of   the  courts   and
appropriate steps including any preventive arrest or
other  arrest    as  required    in   the   wisdom   of  the
administration as required to be taken.         We can only
emphasize that it is the administration’s duty and
obligation   as  also  the    methodology    by  which  they
have to ensure [no advice is necessary by us] to see
to it that the Courts are made functional and the
agitating  lawyers  are   not able  to   obstruct  the
working of the Court nor any ingress and egress of
the lawyers willing to work or the public who seeks
to  practice directly   since these  lawyers  are  not
assisting them.
The judicial officers will pass necessary orders
in each of the proceedings and if adverse orders
become necessary, let the same be passed as we have
given the option to the litigants to come to court
and defend or prosecute their proceedings freely.
Further status report be filed by the Registrar.
List on 12.12.2022.
