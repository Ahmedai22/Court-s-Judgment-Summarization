19/9/2019, passed by a sole arbitrator in pursuance of statutory
arbitration undertaken as per Section 84 of the Multi-State Co-
operative Societies Act, 2002 (hereinafter referred to as the Act of

3.      The brief facts leading up to filing of the present petition
are that according to the respondent-Bank, the principal borrower
i.e. M/s. Erica Healthcare Pvt. Ltd. was advanced loan and cash
credit facility, to which the petitioner alongwith others was a
guarantor. It was the case of the respondent-Bank that a Deed of
Guarantee was also executed in that context. There was default
in repayment of loan and this led to disputes between the
respondent-Bank and the principal borrower, pursuant to which
arbitration proceedings were initiated under Section 84 of the Act
4.      In the said proceedings, the petitioner alongwith the
principal borrower and the other guarantors were made parties.
According to the respondent-Bank, the petitioner and the other
parties to the arbitration proceedings were evading service, due to
which the respondent-Bank had to serve the petitioner by way of
substituted service. According to the respondent-Bank, upon the
petitioner being served, the matter proceeded before the learned
arbitrator.    On 19/9/2019, the impugned award came to be
passed, wherein the operative portion directed as follows:
1.   The Opponents No.1 to 7 are ordered and
directed to pay jointly and severally to the Disputant
Bank viz: NKGSB Co-operative Bank Ltd. an amount
of Rs.8,74,11,165-22 due as on 31-5-2019 with future
Mamta Kale                                                      page 2 of 16
interest thereon @ 15% p.a. from 1-6-2019 till
realization.
2.     The Opponents are further directed to pay
Rs.46,500/-       towards     arbitration   charges        and
Rs.12,500/- towards Administrative cost.
3.     The Bank is at liberty to attach the Bank accounts
of the Opponents, if found necessary.
5.      According to the petitioner, she was completely unaware of
the said proceedings, for the reason that she was never served
with notice and the entire proceedings were conducted behind
her back. It was only when the respondent-Bank addressed a
letter dated 31/10/2019, to the employer of the petitioner,
annexing a copy of the award that she became aware of the
impugned award. It is further the case of the petitioner that the
Recovery Officer addressed a communication to the employer on
31/12/2021, as a reminder to attach the salary of the petitioner
for satisfying the liability imposed upon her under the impugned
6.      It is the specific case of the petitioner that even till date she
has not been served with the original signed award by the
arbitrator and it was only when coercive steps were taken through
her employer, that she was constrained to approach this Court by
filing the present petition under Section 34 of the Arbitration

and Conciliation Act, 1996 (hereinafter referred to as the Act of
7.      Mr. Vishal Pattabiraman, learned counsel appearing for the
petitioner submitted that the issue of limitation in the present
case would not arise, for the reason that the petitioner was never
served with the original signed copy of the award. In this regard,
reliance was placed on judgment of the Supreme Court in the
case of The State of Maharashtra and Ors. Vs. M/s. Ark Builders
Pvt. Ltd. (Judgment and order dated 28/2/2011 in Civil Appeal
8.      It is further submitted that in any case, the impugned award
deserves to be set aside on the ground of gross violation of
principles of natural justice, for the reason that the petitioner was
never served with notice as regards the said arbitration
proceedings. It is submitted that the documents now available on
record before this Court clearly indicate that the notice sent by
Registered Post AD was returned with the remark ‘Not Known’
and that subsequent attempts made to serve through substituted
service on the part of the respondent-Bank could not be said to
be enough to satisfy the requirement of law. Therefore, it was
submitted that the impugned award deserves to be set aside on
the said ground.
9.      It was further submitted that in the present case, in any
event, the impugned award was passed against the petitioner,
without jurisdiction by the learned arbitrator, on a proper
interpretation of Section 84 of the Act of 2002. By relying upon
the definition of the expression ‘Member’ as per Section 3(n) of
the said Act, and the specific stipulations in Section 84(1)
thereof, it was submitted that the petitioner, not being a member
of the respondent Multi-State Cooperative Bank, there was no
question of the learned arbitrator assuming jurisdiction in the
matter, as against the petitioner. In support of the aforesaid
submission, the petitioner relied upon the documents placed by
the respondent-Bank before this Court with the additional
affidavit, which indicate that although the principal borrower was
inducted as a regular member and other guarantors were inducted
as nominal members, the petitioner never submitted any form for
membership, thereby indicating that Section 84(1) of the Act of
2002, could not have been invoked, in so far as the petitioner was
10.     On this basis, it was submitted that the impugned award
was rendered without jurisdiction and hence, vulnerable to
interference under the limited scope available under Section 34
of the Act of 1996.
11.     On the other hand, Mr. Joel Carlos, learned counsel
appearing for the respondent-Bank, submitted that in the present
case, the principal borrower had defaulted and therefore, the
Bank was constrained to invoke Section 84(1) of the Act of 2002,
seeking reference of disputes to arbitration. In so far as service of
notice on the petitioner was concerned, it was submitted that the
Bank attempted to serve the petitioner on the address available
with it. It was crucial that the said address pertained to the very
apartment, which was attached and sold by the respondent-Bank
for satisfying the liability of the principal borrower and that
therefore, it was incumbent upon the petitioner to have divulged
her latest and correct address, as she was always aware about the
recovery proceedings initiated by the respondent-Bank against
the principal borrower. It was submitted that, in any case, the
petitioner stood validly served by way of substituted service and
that therefore, there was no substance in the contention regarding
violation of principles of natural justice, during the arbitration
12.     On the issue of limitation, the learned counsel appearing
for the respondent-Bank fairly submitted that the position was
covered by the aforementioned judgment of the Supreme Court
in the case of the State of Maharashtra & Ors. Vs. M/s. Ark
13.     In so far as the interpretation of Section 84(1) of the Act of
2002 is concerned, the learned counsel for the respondent-Bank
relied upon Section 84(2)(b) of the said Act to contend that the
said provision read in conjunction with Section 84(1) and Section
3(n) thereof, would indicate that even if the petitioner could not
be said to be a member of the respondent-Bank, the learned
arbitrator could exercise jurisdiction in the disputes that arose in
the facts and circumstances of the present case.
14.     This Court has considered the rival submissions in the
present matter. Although, the grounds pertaining to violation of
principles of natural justice and the aspect of limitation have been
highlighted on behalf of the petitioner, this Court is of the
opinion that the issue which really goes to the root of the matter
pertains to interpretation of Section 84 of the Act of 2002, in
order to examine as to whether the petitioner is justified in
claiming that the impugned award was rendered without
jurisdiction, qua the petitioner.
15.     In order to appreciate the rival contentions, it would be
appropriate to refer to Section 84 of the Act of 2002, which reads
84. Reference of disputes: -
(1) Notwithstanding anything contained in any
Mamta Kale                                                         page 7 of 16
other law for the time being in force, if any dispute
[other than a dispute regarding disciplinary action
taken by a multi-State co-operative society against its
paid employee or an industrial dispute as defined in

between a multi-State co-operative society and

or between the liquidator of one multi-State co-
operative society and the liquidator of another multi-
State co-operative society, such dispute shall be
referred to arbitration.
(2)    For the purposes of sub-section (1), the
following shall be deemed to be disputes touching the
constitution, management or business of a multi-State
co-operative society, namely:
(a) a claim by the multi-State co-operative society
for any debt or demand due to it from a member or
the nominee, heirs or legal representatives of a
deceased member, whether such debt or demand be
(b) a claim by a surety against the principal
debtor where the multi-State co-operative society has
recovered from the surety any amount in respect of
any debt or demand due to it from the principal
debtor as a result of the default of the principal debtor,
whether such debt or demand is admitted or not;
(c) any dispute arising in connection with the
election of any officer of a multi-State co-operative
society.

referred to arbitration under this section is or is not a
dispute touching the constitution, management or
business of a multi-State co-operative society, the
decision thereon of the arbitrator shall be final and
shall not be called in question in any court.
(4)   Where a dispute has been referred to
arbitration under sub-section (1), the same shall be
settled or decided by the arbitrator to be appointed by
the Central Registrar.
(5)  Save as otherwise provided under this Act,
the provisions of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act,
1996 (26 of 1996) shall apply to all arbitration under
this Act as if the proceedings for arbitration were
referred for settlement or decision under the
provisions of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act,
1996 (26 of 1996).
This clause relates to settlement of disputes
touching the constitution, management or business of
a multi-State co-operative society. It further provides
that such disputes shall be referred to the Co-operative
Disputes Settlement Authority. It also specifies the
disputes which shall be deemed to be disputes
touching the constitution, management or business of
the multi-State co-operative society. (Notes on
16.     It would be relevant to refer to Section 3(n) of the said Act,
which defines the expression ‘member’.            The same reads as
Section 3(n): “member” means a person joining in the
application for the registration of a multi-State co-
operative society and includes a person admitted to
membership after such registration in accordance with
the provisions of this Act, the rules and the bye-laws.
17.     It is significant that the Act of 2002 provides for a detailed
procedure under which a person is inducted as a member of a
Multi-State Co-operative Society. This entails the submission of
application form as prescribed as per Rules and bye-laws.
18.     This has some significance in the context of sub-section (1)
of Section 84 of the Act of 2002, which is quoted above. The
aforesaid provision makes it clear that disputes shall be referred to
arbitration, which arise amongst members, past members and
persons claiming through members and the Multi-State Co-
operative Society touching upon the constitution, management or
business of the said society.
19.     Therefore, it is clear that only such disputes as specified in
the aforementioned provision could be referred to arbitration. In
Mamta Kale                                                      page 11 of 16
the present case, the petitioner asserts that she never applied for
membership of the respondent-Bank (a Multi-State Co-operative
Society) and therefore, she was never inducted as a member of the
same, thereby showing that Section 84(1) of the said Act, could
not have been invoked in her context. It is clear that a dispute,
which is not covered under the said provision would not be
capable of being referred to arbitration under the said provision.
The respondent-Bank was required to show that the dispute,
which was referred to arbitration arose between the respondent-
Bank and a member, past member or a person claiming through a
20.     Section 3(n) of the Act of 2002, specifies as to who is to be
treated as a member. It requires the person who is to be treated as
a member to have applied for membership with the Multi-State
Co-operative Society and having been admitted to such
membership. The documents on record placed alongwith the
additional affidavit filed by the respondent-Bank show that the
principal borrower had applied for regular membership of the
respondent-Bank and the other guarantors (respondents before
the learned arbitrator) had applied for nominal membership. The
application forms duly filled and signed by the principal borrower
and other guarantors were placed on record with the additional
affidavit.    Such an application on behalf of the petitioner is
conspicuous by its absence. It is clearly stated on behalf of the
Mamta Kale                                                     page 12 of 16
respondent-Bank that it does not have any such documents
pertaining to the petitioner in its record. Thus, it becomes clear
that the petitioner never applied for membership and therefore,
there is no question of she being admitted as a member of the
21.      Since the petitioner cannot be treated as a member of the
respondent-Bank, even if disputes arose between them, the
respondent-Bank could not have invoked Section 84(1) of the
Act of 2002, for referring the said dispute for arbitration in so far
as the petitioner was concerned. The said contention raised on
behalf of the petitioner therefore, deserves to be accepted. The
said proposition is also supported by the judgment of the Single
Judge of this Court in the case of Prakash Vrundavan Thakkar
Vs. Nagpur Nagrik Sahakari Bank Ltd. and Ors. 1 . In the said
case, in similar facts, where a Multi-State Co-operative Society
desired to proceed against a guarantor who was not a member of
the society, it was held that reference to arbitration and the
consequent award passed by the arbitrator against such guarantor
were unsustainable. This Court allowed the appeal, setting aside
the order passed by the District Court, which had upheld the
award passed by the arbitrator against such guarantor. The said
case appears to be close on facts to the present case and therefore,
this Court is convinced that the aforementioned contention
raised on behalf of the petitioner, in the context of Section 84(1)
of the Act of 2002, deserves to be accepted.
22.     In so far as reliance placed by learned counsel appearing for
the respondent-Bank on Section 84(2)(b) of the Act of 2002 is
concerned, suffice it to say that sub-section (2) of Section 84
thereof, elaborates the aspect of disputes touching upon the
constitution, management or business of a Multi-State Co-
operative Society. It does not dilute any requirement of Section
84(1) of the Act of 2002, which pertains to disputes that can be
referred to arbitration and the parties to such disputes that can be
referred to such arbitral proceedings.
23.     In so far as the question of violation of principles of natural
justice is concerned, there is some substance in the contention
raised on behalf of the respondent-Bank that in view of
substituted service, it can be said that the petitioner was served
with notice and that therefore, the arbitrator was justified in
proceeding against the petitioner. This Court is not going into
the details of the manner of service of notice and the rival
contentions raised in that regard, for the reason that on the
question of jurisdiction of the arbitrator itself, this Court is
convinced that the contentions raised on behalf of the petitioner
deserve to be accepted.
24.     As regards the question of limitation, the position of law
clarified by the Supreme Court in the case of State of
Mamta Kale                                                       page 14 of 16
Maharashtra Vs. M/s. Ark Builders Pvt. Ltd. (supra) shows that
the period of limitation would start to run only when the original
signed award was served on the petitioner. There is nothing on
record to show that original signed award was ever served on the
petitioner and therefore, the period of limitation was never
25.     It was only when the petitioner was served with a copy of
the award through her employer that she became aware about the
same. As per the law laid down in the said judgment, such
method of service of a copy of the award on the petitioner would
not trigger limitation and therefore, the contention raised on
behalf of the petitioner deserves to be accepted.
26.     In the light of above, this Court finds that the petitioner has
made out a case for interference with the impugned award under
Section 34 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, for the
reason that the arbitral award was rendered without jurisdiction,
as the disputes could not have been referred for arbitration under
Section 84(1) of the Act of 2002, in so far as the petitioner was
concerned. In view of the above, the impugned award is set
aside, in so far as the petitioner is concerned.
27.     Needless to say, it would be open for the respondent-Bank
to seek such other remedy, as may be available in law, to recover
the amount from the petitioner as a guarantor, if permissible in
Mamta Kale                                                       page 15 of 16
law and the present judgment shall not come in the away of the
parties in that regard.
28.     The petition stands disposed of in above terms.
