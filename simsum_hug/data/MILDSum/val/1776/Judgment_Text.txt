2.     The brief facts are these:
It is stated that the petitioner was working as Circle
Inspector at D.R.B.C Branch, Chikkaballapur at the time of the
alleged incident. Later, he was promoted and he was posted at
It is averred that the second respondent telephoned the
petitioner on 26.09.2010 and informed him that on 19.09.2010
that while having food at the LVT Daba, he had a scuffle with a
person named Mr.Lakshmikanth and 15 others concerning the
payment of commission for purchasing land. The second
respondent requested the petitioner to register a case based on
the complaint given to the Doddaballapur Police Station. Based
WP No. 51993 of 2015
on the request, the petitioner telephoned the PSI Mr.Rajendra
Kumar, and instructed him to take necessary action. Pursuant
to   the  complaint   given   by   the  second  respondent  on
26.09.2010 the Police Sub-Inspector -Mr.Rajendra Kumar., filed
FIR in Cr.No.107/2010 for the alleged offences punishable
under Sections 143, 147, 148, 342, 323, 324, 506(b), 327 read
with Section 149 of IPC against Mr.Lakshmikanth and fifteen
Thereafter, the PSI being the Investigating Officer,
conducted the investigation and filed a charge sheet with Addl.
Civil Judge and JMFC, Doddaballapur. Based on the charge
sheet, the Court conducted proceedings and passed the
Judgment     acquitting   the   accused   Mr.Lakshmikanth   on
As things stood thus, Sri.K.A.Appanna - the second
respondent filed a complaint with the Karnataka State Human
Rights Commission against the petitioner and Mr.Rajendra
Kumar, the PSI of Doddaballapur. Based on the complaint, the
Commission sent a copy of the complaint to the Inspector
General of Police, Karnataka Human Rights Commission for
WP No. 51993 of 2015
conducting an inquiry and to submit a report. Accordingly, the
IGP, KHRC after conducting an inquiry, submitted a report.
Based on the report submitted by IGP, KHRC proves the
charges only against Mr.Rajendra Kumar, PSI Doddaballapur.
The Commission issued notice to Mr.Rajendra Kumar on
30.04.2012 to give a written reason for the report submitted by
the Inspector General of Police, Karnataka Human Rights
Commission. Accordingly, Mr.Rajendra Kumar submitted a
written    statement   of   reason    justifying  his   actions.
Subsequently, the Commission based on the complaint, report
of  IGP,   KHRC,   and  a  written   statement   of  reason  by
Mr.Rajendra Kumar, PSI Doddaballapur vide order           dated
20.06.2015. imposed a fine of Rs.10,000/- (Rupees Ten
Thousand only) not only on Mr. Rajendra Kumar’s PSI but also
on the petitioner.
Under these circumstances, the petitioner left with no
other alternative and efficacious remedy is filing this Writ
Petition under Articles 226 and 227 of the Constitution of
Learned counsel for the petitioner and respondent No.1
urged several contentions.
4.    Heard, the contentions urged on behalf of the
respective parties and perused the Writ papers and also the
Annexures with utmost care.
Sri.Sagar., learned counsel for the petitioner vehemently
contended that the petitioner being the Circle Inspector has
discharged his duties honestly and obediently. He argued that
the moment the petitioner received a telephone call from the
complainant – the second respondent, he properly instructed
the PSI Mr.Rajendra Kumar to act in accordance with the law.
He argued by saying that under his direction, the PSI filed FIR
in Crime No.107/2010. Hence, there is no dereliction of duty
as noticed by the Commission. Counsel, therefore, submits that
the order passed by the Commission imposing a penalty of
Rs.10,000/- (Rupees Ten Thousand only) on the petitioner is
By way of answer, Sri.Gopalkrishna Soodhi., learned
counsel for Commission submits that the Commission has found
that  the   petitioner  being the   Circle  Inspector  has  not
discharged his duties properly. Hence, taking note of the
material evidence on record, in particular the statements which
WP No. 51993 of 2015
are recorded before the Commission, the Commission justified
in imposing a penalty. Counsel, therefore, sought to justify the
order passed by the Commission.
The short point which arises for my consideration is:
Is the imposition of a penalty on the
The facts have been sufficiently stated and the same does
not require reiteration.
Suffice it to note that the petitioner being the Circle
Inspector    received    a  telephone    call   from   the   second
respondent. A request was made by the second respondent to
register a case based on his complaint. It is seen from the
records that the petitioner being the Circle Inspector instructed
the Police Sub-Inspector - Mr.Rajendra Kumar on the very
same day and directed him to take necessary action.
The    second    respondent    gave    the    complaint   on
26.09.2010. Thereafter, the PSI Mr.Rajendra Kumar filed an
FIR   in  Cr.No.107/2010.     It  is  pivotal  to   note   that the
Investigating Officer conducted an investigation and filed a
charge    sheet    with   the   Addl.   Civil  Judge    and   JMFC,
WP No. 51993 of 2015
Doddaballapur. The Court conducted proceedings and the same
was    ended    in  the  order  of  acquittal   of  the accused
As things stood thus, for the best reasons known to the
second respondent, complained to the Karnataka Human Rights
Commission that there is a dereliction of duty by the petitioner.
It is further relevant to note that based on the complaint, the
Commission proceeded in the matter.         In my opinion, the
giving of the complaint and the initiation of the proceedings by
the commission is unsustainable in law. law. The reason is quite
simple.    Proceedings before the appropriate forum have been
concluded. It is pivotal to note that the order of acquittal was
passed by the court. If the second respondent had any
grievance or was not satisfied with the order of acquittal of
Mr.Lakshmikanth, the proper course would have been in a
different Forum altogether. Furthermore, even the finding of
the commission that the petitioner has not instructed the PSI in
writing is wholly incorrect and untenable. It is common sense
that the Circle Inspector is higher in ranking than the Police
Sub-Inspector. Based on a telephone call the petitioner has
WP No. 51993 of 2015
directed the official concerned i.e., PSI Mr.Rajendra Kumar to
act in accordance with the law.
It is needless to observe that legal action was set in
motion and the Court has passed the Judgment as per the law.
Therefore, in my opinion, there is no dereliction of duty as
alleged by the complainant.       I may venture to say that the
commission has failed to have regard to relevant considerations
and disregarded relevant matters. In my considered opinion,
the imposition of penalty so far as the petitioner is concerned is
unsustainable in law. Hence, the same is liable to be set aside.
The result is that the Writ Petition will be allowed. This
court orders a writ of Certiorari. The order dated:20.06.2015
passed      by     the    Human        Rights    Commission     in
H.R.C.No.4860/2011(SB-1)        vide    Annexure-A    imposing   a
penalty of Rs.10,000/- (Rupees Ten Thousand only) in so far as
the petitioner is concerned is set-aside.
Resultantly, the Writ Petition is allowed.
