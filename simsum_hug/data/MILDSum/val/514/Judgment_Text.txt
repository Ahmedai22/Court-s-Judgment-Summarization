had come to the Court for visiting the relatives who are in jail, in the
case of Santacurz police station, and, their cases are pending in the

rpa                             12/21          1 apeal 1138 2015 J.doc
The inference can be drawn from her deposition that she was panch
witness in several cases. He knows police offcers from Santacurz
police station as he oftenly visits there. The DCB CID Bandra is under
Santacurz police station. His residence is at the distance of 15 to 20
minutes from the offce of DCB CID Unit Bandra by auto-rickshaw. He
admitted that Antop Hill and Kings Circle are different areas. King
Circle is in Matunga and Antop Hill is in Sion Koliwada. Accused no.6
had stated that she is residing at Antop Hill, Sion Koliwada. It would
not be correct to say that accused no.6 is residing at Kings Circle,
Matunga below railway bridge. It is mentioned in the panchanama
that accused no.6 is residing at Kings Circle, Matunga, below railway
bridge. He cannot assign any reason as to why said fact is mentioned
in the panchanama. In the cross–examination, it was further stated
that the police inquired about the family members who were residing
in the house. Accused no.6 told that she was residing along with her
husband and friend of husband in the said house. Husband of accused
no.6 and friend of her husband were not present when they had
visited the house of accused no.6. Police inquired with neighbours
about the persons who were residing in the house and that the said
house was given on rent. The tenant was called by police and his
statement was recorded in her presence.
15           From the evidence of P.W.3, it is apparent that there are
discrepancies about the place of residence of accused no.6 in the
panchanama and place where the search was carried out. The
premises were occupied by several persons. The accused no.6 was
residing with her husband who and his friend are co-accused in the
present case. Premises were also occupied by the tenant. Statements
of tenant were recorded. The tenant has not been examined by the
prosecution. It is diffcult to note that the accused no.6 was in
conscious possession of counterfeit currency notes recovered from the
residential premises.
16           P.W.4 Naruddin Talibuddin Shaikh is also acted as panch
witness. According to him, he was passing from the road at the time
he was requested to act as panch witness. He stated that three
accused persons were present at Beat Chowki. One was the woman.
One of the accused disclosed his name as Mohammad Mujibil, and, he
was found in possession of 10 notes in the denomination of Rs.1,000/-,
20 notes in the denomination of Rs.500/-. Another accused disclosed
his name as Jin, but, he do not remember his full name. He was found
in possession of 30 notes in the denomination of Rs.500/-. One lady
constable took the woman inside small room. Lady panch witness

small room when search of the lady accused was conducted. The lady
panch witness and lady police offcer came out after taking personal
search of the said woman accused and told that the woman accused
was found in possession of 30 notes in the denomination of Rs.500/-
and one mobile. Panchanama was recorded. In the cross–examination
this witness has stated that personal search of accused no.6 was taken
in closed room. He had not seen actual search of accused no.6. He
learnt from lady police offcer and one lady panch witness that some
notes in the denomination of Rs.500/- were found with accused no.6.
17           The co-accused Mujibil was not tried as he is absconding.
The search of appellant no.2 was conducted in closed room. It was
allegedly conducted in the presence of lady panch witness and senior
police inspector Sangita Patil. P.W.4 was the other panch since it was
the search of lady, it was conducted in the closed room. P.W.4 had no
occasion to see search and possession of counterfeit currency notes
from accused no.6. He learnt about the possession of currency notes
by accused no.6 through the lady panch witness. However, the lady
panch witness Smt. Meenakshi is not examined by the prosecution.
The only other witness who was allegedly followed search and seizure
of accused no.6, is senior inspector Sangita Paitl. She has been
examined by the prosecution as P.W.6. However,            the necessity of
rpa                            15/21          1 apeal 1138 2015 J.doc
presence of independent panch witness at the time of search and
seizure of counterfeit currency notes is not fulflled since the lady
panch witness is not examined by the prosecution. The version of
P.W.6 who was the part of investigating team is not corroborated by
independent evidence. The evidence about arrest of appellant no.2 or
panchanama of arrest is not referred to by P.W.4.
18            P.W.5 Shri.Shrishilya Kole was the assistant police
inspector. He was attached to Bandra Police Station. He was on duty
as SHO on 7th February, 2012. According to him, P.W.1 came to the
police station at 12.25 hours. He lodged FIR, which was recorded by
him. C.R.No.46 of 2012 was registered under Section 489–B and 489–
C of IPC. In the cross–examination, he stated that the FIR came to be
registered at 13:50 hours. After recording statement of complainant,
he registered it as FIR. He was not aware of the fact of incident before
recording of statement of complainant. The recovered articles from
accused were with API Deepak Sawant and not produced before him in
the police station. No arrest panchanama of accused was prepared in
his presence.

on 7th February, 2012. Panchanama of seizure was drawn in her
presence at Anant Anant Kanekar Marg, Bandra (E), Police beat

disclosed their names as Mujibul Shaikh, Anwarbibi Musibul Shaikh
and Tarifulla Shaikh. Personal search of the accused resulted in
possession of currency notes. Personal search of accused no.6
Anwarbibi was taken in presence of panch witness Manisha Rathod in
one room of police beat chowki. Currency notes in the denomination of
Rs.500/- were found in her possession. She confessed that currency
notes were taken. She deposed that she was the member of raiding
party when all the three accused were apprehended. She did not make
any inquiry with the passerby at the time of raid. She had not
personally inquired with Virendra Mishra and Rajeshkumar Gupta.
Both were present and acted as panch witnesses. There is only one
police beat chowki no.1 at Anant Kanekar Marg.
20           From the evidence of P.W.6, it is clear that accused no.6
was searched in the presence of panch Manisha Rathod. However,
Manisha Rathod has not been examined by the prosecution. Thus, the
recovery of currency notes from accused no.6 (appellant no.2), is
doubtful. There is no independent witness to corroborate version of
21           P.W.7 Arun Satpute was attached to DCB CID Unit IX,
Bandra. On 7th February, 2012, he was present at the offce. According

leading to recovery of counterfeit notes from the residence.

panchs were called on the spot. There was no reason that they did not
take panch witnesses along-with them at the spot. He did not record
rpa                           18/21           1 apeal 1138 2015 J.doc

under Sections 489–B and 489–C read with 120–B of IPC. Both the
appellants were acquitted by the trial Court for the offence under
Section 489–A of IPC. However, they were convicted for the offence
punishable under Section 489–B and 489–C of IPC.
25           Section 489–B of IPC relates to using as genuine, forged
or counterfeit currency–notes or bank–notes. Although the accused
were allegedly found in possession of counterfeit currency notes, there
is no cogent evidence to establish the offence under Section 489–B of
IPC against the appellants. Both the appellants deserves to be
acquitted for the offence under Section 489–B of IPC. However, the
prosecution has proved that accused no.3 (Appellant No.1) has
committed offence under Section 489–C of IPC, which relates to
possession   of  forged  or  counterfeit   currency–notes.         Whereas,

serious infrmities. Both recoveries relating to counterfeit currency
notes at the instance of appellant no.2 suffers from serious
discrepancies and doubtful. The prosecution has not proved beyond
