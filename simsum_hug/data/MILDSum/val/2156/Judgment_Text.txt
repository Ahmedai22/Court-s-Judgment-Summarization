These appeals, by special leave, challenge the judgment and order dated 28th
August, 2009 rendered by the Delhi High Court (hereafter ‘the High Court’, for short)
while disposing of 5 (five) writ petitions, viz. WP(C) Nos. 1854 and 1895 to 1898 of
2.     The High Court, for the reasons assigned in the impugned judgment, declared
section 9-D of the Central Excise and Salt Act, 1944 (hereafter ‘Excise Act’, for short)
as intra vires while dismissing the writ petitions.
3.     In course of hearing before us, Mr. S.K. Bagaria, learned senior counsel
appearing for the appellants, did not even attempt to assail the reasons assigned by
the High Court for up-holding the constitutional validity of section 9-D of the Excise
Act. However, Mr. Bagaria argued that by a judgment and order dated 25th April, 2008,
this Court had remitted the matters back to the High Court for consideration thereof
afresh. In view of the judicial mandate, while deciding the writ petitions afresh on
remand, the High Court could not have limited its decision only to the issue relating to
vires of section 9- D. The writ petitions, as amended, also raised the issue as to how
the essential pre-requisites of section 9-D were breached by the department in the
adjudication orders. The effect of the principles and pre-requisites laid down by the
High Court for invocation of section 9-D vis-à-vis the appellants’ case could not have
been left undecided.
4.     According to Mr. Bagaria, the principles laid down by the High Court in the
impugned judgment ought to have been applied to test the legality and correctness of
the impugned action of the department and there being apparent breach of such
principles at the end of the department, the High Court committed an error of law in
not deciding the other issues raised in the writ petitions. In other words, according to
Mr. Bagaria, the High Court could not have stopped at deciding the issue of vires of
section 9-D by reading it down and summarizing the conditions precedent in-built into
it and it was obligatory for the High Court to decide the writ petitions in its totality; and
while so deciding, to declare whether on the parameters of the conditions precedent
in section 9-D, as laid down in the impugned judgment, the petitioners were entitled
to any relief or not.
5.       Mr. Bagaria continued by submitting that the details of the earlier proceedings
as well as all earlier orders including the orders passed by the Customs, Excise and
Gold Control Appellate Tribunal (hereafter ‘Tribunal’, for short) and this Court were
placed on record before this Court by way of a ‘status chart’. Such status chart was
reproduced in the judgment and order dated 25th April, 2008; and after noting all these
facts, the matters were remitted to the High Court for deciding the writ petitions afresh.
It is not as if the remand was only for deciding the issue of section 9-D alone without
deciding the remaining issues raised in the writ petitions.
6.       The argument of Mr. Bagaria was that if the effect of the principles and pre-
requisites laid down by the High Court visà-vis the appellants’ case were to be left
undecided, the entire proceedings continuing since the last several years would simply
be rendered academic. He has, therefore, endeavoured to persuade us hold that the
High Court committed an error of law requiring correction by us.
7.       Mr. Bagaria referred to the decisions of this Court in State of UP vs.
Mohammad Nooh1, Calcutta Discount Company vs. ITO2, Institute of Chartered
Accountants of India vs. L.K. Ratna3 and Andaman Timber Industries vs. CCE4
in support of his arguments.
8.       To appreciate the contentions of Mr. Bagaria, we need to take a quick look at
the events preceding the impugned judgment and order.
9.       The facts giving rise to the writ petitions reveal that huge demands of about Rs.
94,00,00,000/- were raised by the department on the ground that the appellants and
its job workers had manufactured deceptively similar versions of certain regular
brands of cigarettes showing sale price whereas the same were sold through
marketing chain at the higher price of normal brands and that the difference between
the two prices was received by the appellants as flow-back through various super
wholesale buyers. On 23rd March, 1988 and 29th March, 1988, two show-cause notices
were issued by the department to the petitioners raising demands for alleged short
payment of excise duty. Such notices primarily relied on the statements of 75
(seventy-five) witnesses to establish the recovery of prices higher than the declared
prices and flow back of additional amounts to the appellants. Pursuant to directions of
the Bombay High Court, facility of cross-examination was extended in respect of only
29 (twenty-nine) witnesses and most of them, during crossexamination, denied any
flow back to the appellants. The remaining statements remained untested but were
relied upon by invoking section 9-D of the Excise Act. Grievance of the appellants in
the writ petitions was that the parameters of section 9-D had been completely ignored
by the authorities.
10.      Since the show-cause notices were spread over a thousand pages and 600 (six
hundred) of which were related to 63 (sixty-three) statements on which the department
had placed reliance, the appellants on 6th March, 1991 made a request for cross-
examination of 31 (thirty-one) witnesses. However, without attempting to follow the
principles of natural justice, adjudication orders in respect of the showcause notices
had been passed by the adjudicating authority confirming the demands.
11.     Despite persistent requests, the facility of crossexamination was denied. Even
before the Collector of Central Excise had passed any order confirming the demand
of duty against them, the appellants had rushed to the High Court to complain about
the fairness of the procedure followed by the Collector, more particularly, the denial of
the opportunity to cross-examine. During the pendency of the proceedings, the
Collector had passed the final orders. By applying for amendment in each one of the
writ petitions, permission was sought to assail the validity of the orders passed by the
Collector. Such applications were disposed of by an order dated 28th October, 1992
with the observation that the order of the Collector being appealable, the petitioners
could pursue their remedy in appeal before the prescribed appellate authority.
However, since there was also a challenge to the constitutional validity of section 9-D
of the Excise Act, the High Court did not dispose of the writ petitions finally but
intended to examine that limited question later. The petitioners had preferred appeals
before the Tribunal for the period relevant to WP(C) 1854/1992 and 1895/1992. The
Tribunal had disposed of the appeals in favour of the department, whereafter appeals
were carried to this Court. The appeals arising out of orders passed by the Tribunal
relevant to WP(C) Nos. 1896/1992 and 1898/1992 were dismissed by an order dated
12th September, 1997 of this Court for failure to make the requisite pre-deposit.
12.     The Tribunal on 21st March, 2001 had allowed appeals filed by M/s J&K
Cigarettes and M/s. Kanpur Cigarettes Pvt. Ltd. These orders were carried in appeal
by the department by filing appeals before this Court under section 35L of the Excise
Act, being Civil Appeal Nos. 6398-6403 of 2002.
13.     During the pendency of these 2 (two) appeals, the 5 (five) writ petitions came
up for hearing before the High Court on December 6, 2006. The common grievance
of the petitioners was noted by the High Court in paragraph 3, that they had invoked
the writ jurisdiction feeling aggrieved by denial of adequate opportunity to cross-
examine certain witnesses whose statements were recorded by the excise authorities
in the course of investigation. The appellants had argued that the statements of such
witnesses, obtained by the excise authorities in the course of their investigation, could
only be used if they were given an opportunity to crossexamine the witnesses.
14.     The High Court in its order dated 6th December, 2006 recorded that 2 (two)
issues emerged for decision, viz.,
“1. Whether this Court would be justified in reading down or interpreting Section 9-D of the
Act as suggested by counsel for the petitioner company when three appeals involving the
validity of the orders passed by the Collector and the CEGAT placing reliance upon Section
9-D of the Act are pending before the Supreme Court?
2. If answer to question No. 1 is in the affirmative, whether Section 9-D suffers from any vice
15.     Insofar as the first question is concerned, the High Court, inter alia, held as
“Two of the orders when challenged before the Supreme Court, were upheld by Their
Lordships also while the remaining three appeals are pending adjudication. It is obvious that
stand (sic) disposed of or those pending before the Apex Court, the question of fairness of
the procedure and in particular, the denial of any opportunity to cross-examine the witnesses
was and continues be available to the petitioner. If the discretion vested in the authority in
terms of Section 9D(1)(a) has been improperly exercised, Their Lordships could have granted
relief in the disposed of appeals and can even now grant relief to the petitioner in the appeals
that are pending for disposal. It is also evident that while examining the question of fairness
of the procedure adopted by the adjudicating authority, the interpretation of provisions of
Section 9D(1)(a) would fall for consideration of Their Lordships. What is the true scope of
Section 9 D(1)(a) and what is the true interpretation to be placed upon the same having
regard to the possible 'constitutional infirmity suggested by the petitioner's is a matter which
would legitimately arise for consideration of the Supreme Court. Even assuming that the
dismissal of two appeals filed by the petitioner involving the same question is not indicative
of the Court finding infirmity either (sic, in) the procedure adopted by the adjudicating authority
or in the interpretation placed upon Section 9D(1)(a) by the saidauthority or the Tribunal, the
contrary interpretation which petitioner wishes this Court to place upon Section 9D is a matter
still open to the petitioners before the Supreme Court. That being so, there is no compelling
reason why this court should take upon itself the exercise of interpreting Section 9 D and in
the process reading the same down as suggested by the petitioner. If the interpretation
suggested does eventually appeal to the Supreme Court during the course the hearing
pending before Their Lordships, the opinion of this court on that aspect would be wholly
inconsequential and academic. Such an academic exercise need not be undertaken by this
court nor is any duplication of the process of interpretation (sic) Question number 1 is,
therefore, answered in the negative.”
In the light of the answer to question no. 1, the Court felt that the answer to the second
question becomes unnecessary. Consequently, the writ petitions were dismissed with
16. The judgment and order dated 6th December, 2006 was carried in appeal
before this Court in Civil Appeal Nos.3187-3189/2008. By an order dated 25th April,
2008, this Court disposed of the appeals by the following order:-
“7.      The High Court, as noticed hereinbefore, did not decide the question of
constitutionality of the said provision, nor did it determine the objection of the respondents
that no cause of action had arisen therefor.
8.       We are, therefore, of the opinion that interest of justice would be subserved if the
impugned judgments are set aside and the matters are remitted back to the High Court for
consideration thereof afresh. We direct accordingly.
9.       The appeals are disposed of with the aforementioned observations and directions.
10.      However, as these matters are pending for a long time, we would request the High
Court to consider the desirability of disposing of thewrit petitions, filed by the appellants, as
expeditiously as possible, preferably without a period of three months from the date of
communication of this order. All contentions of the parties shall remain open.”
17. It was in terms of the order dated 25th April, 2008 that the High Court once again
considered the challenge of the appellants to the vires of section 9-D of the Excise
Act. Upon hearing learned counsel appearing for the parties, the High Court in the
impugned judgment and order dated 28th August, 2009 recorded the following
“32. Thus, we summarize our conclusions as under:-
(i)      We are of the opinion that the provisions of Section 9- D(2) of the Act are not
unconstitutional or ultra vires;
(ii)   While invoking Section 9-D of the Act, the concernedauthority is to form an opinion on
the basis of material on record that a particular ground, as stipulated in the said Section,
(iii)  Such an opinion has to be supported with reasons;
(iv)   Before arriving at this opinion, the authority would give opportunity to the affected party
to make submissions on the available material on the basis of which the authority intends to
arrive at the said opinion; and
(v)    it is always open to the affected party to challenge the invocation of provisions of
Section 9-D of the Act in a particular case by filing statutory appeal, which provides for judicial
and dismissed the writ petitions holding that the same had no merit.
18. Bearing in mind these preceding facts and circumstances, we need to consider
the contentions raised by Mr. Bagaria. For the reasons that follow, the contentions do
not commend acceptance.
19. This Court while remitting the writ petitions to the High Court for hearing the
same afresh had taken note of the fact that, inter alia, the appellants’ appeals bearing
Civil Appeal Nos. 5134-34/1997 questioning the order of the Tribunal confirming the
demands against the appellants stood dismissed by an order of this Court dated 12th
20. As noted above, the orders of the Tribunal dated 21st March, 2001 deciding the
appeals in favour of the appellants, were the subject matter of challenge in this Court
at the instance of the department in Civil Appeal Nos.63986403/2002 . Such appeals
were ultimately allowed by order dated 31st July, 2008; while directing a remand, it
was observed by this Court that the Tribunal had not recorded any findings regarding
the flow back.
21. At this juncture, from paragraph 1(xxiv) of the Statement of Case filed on 10th
December, 2012, we also note that pursuant to the remand ordered by this Court as
above, the Tribunal disposed of the statutory appeals confirming the demands against
Kanpur Cigarettes Pvt. Ltd. and J&K Cigarettes. Civil Appeal Nos. 1533-1534 of 2011,
carried before this Court from the orders of the Tribunal, were thereafter dismissed in
view of inability to comply with the conditional order passed by this Court directing
issue of notice subject to deposit of the entire demand amount as confirmed.
22. There was one other appeal filed before this Court but the same too had not
been not pursued by the appellants and the job workers.
23. Therefore, as on date of hearing of these civil appeals, there is no lis pending
in respect of the concerned demands between the parties.
24. It would be appropriate to note the issues involved in the writ petitions. First, the
vires of section 9-D of the Excise Act was under challenge. Secondly, even if section
9-D were intra vires, whether the parameters thereof were completely ignored by the
excise authorities.
25. The writ petitions were instituted before the High Court way back in 1992 before
any adjudication order was passed praying, inter-alia, for cross-examination of the
remaining witnesses whose cross-examination had already been permitted but who
were not produced. Pursuant to the liberty given by the High Court, the appellants filed
an application for amendment mentioning in detail as to how and for what reasons
invocation of section 9-D by the Commissioner was illegal and also challenging the
vires of section 9-D of the Excise Act.
26. Though vehemently argued by Mr. Bagaria, there is no pending proceeding
where the principles and prerequisites laid down by the High Court for invocation of
section 9-D of the Excise Act vis-à-vis the appellants’ case could be attracted for a
decision. When this Court by its order dated 25th April, 2008 remitted the matter to the
High Court for deciding the question of vires of section 9-D, only the civil appeals
carried from the orders of the Tribunal by the department were pending. These
appeals were ultimately allowed by this Court vide its order dated 31st July, 2008 and
the matters remitted to the Tribunal. These two appeals, on remand to the Tribunal,
have since been decided in favour of the department and against the appellants. As
noticed above, the appeals carried to this Court by the appellants from the orders of
the Tribunal confirming the demands against the appellants also stand dismissed. We
are, therefore, left to wonder in which proceedings would the principles and
prerequisites and/or the parameters of the conditions precedent in section 9-D, laid
down by the High Court, could at all be applied.
27. The contentions raised by Mr. Bagaria that the parameters of section 9-D were
completely ignored while the adjudication orders were made could have been
regarded to be of some worth and engaged our attention if only any remedy by way
of an appeal before the departmental authority or by a petition before any court were
open to be pursued by the appellants as on date these civil appeals came up for
consideration before us. What we find from the factual narrative is that although two
proceedings were pending before the Tribunal in view of the order of remand dated
31st July, 2008 when the judgment and order dated 28th August, 2009 under challenge
came to be made, even those proceedings stand closed today after the appellants
had approached this Court and their civil appeals stood dismissed for non-deposit of
the amount demanded. With the final decision on all the appeals arising from the
orders of the Tribunal being rendered against the appellants, there is no pending lis
where the principles and conditions precedent could be applied. The endeavour of the
appellants to have these appeals argued before us is, therefore, of purely academic
interest and would not serve any real purpose.
28. While dismissing the civil appeals, we endorse the views of the High Court
insofar as it spurned the challenge of the appellants to the constitutional validity of
section 9-D of the Excise Act.
29. For unnecessarily protracting the proceedings before this Court, although no lis
survived for resolution, we impose costs of Rs.5,00,000/- on the appellants. This
amount is to be paid to any charitable organization involved in providing help,
assistance and relief to children suffering from cancer. Such costs shall be paid within
a month from date. Within two weeks thereof, proof of payment shall be produced
before the Registrar who shall satisfy himself that the recipient organization is, in fact,
providing care to children suffering from cancer. In default thereof, the amount of costs
shall be recovered as arrears of land revenue.
