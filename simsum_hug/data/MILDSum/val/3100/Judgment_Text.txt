Through: Mr. Sandeep Sethi, Sr. Advocate with
1.     This hearing has been done through hybrid mode.
2.     The Plaintiff has filed the present suit seeking permanent injunction,
restraining infringement of trademark, passing off, dilution, unfair
competition, delivery up, rendition of accounts, damages, and other reliefs in
respect of the trademark ‘PLANT POWERED’.
3.     The case of the Plaintiff is that it was incorporated in the year 2016,
and over the years, it has sold various baby care and personal care products
which are natural and eco-friendly, including detergent, lotions, face wash,
face cream, sunscreen face mask etc., under the trademark ‘PLANT
POWERED’. The trademark ‘PLANT POWERED’ was adopted by the
Plaintiff in the year 2019, and has been using the said trademark along with
Application No.4363416 dated 30th November, 2019 was filed by the
Plaintiff in Class 3, along with the label which was used by the Plaintiff. The
said mark was registered. Apart from the said application, the Plaintiff has
sought registrations by way of other applications in Class 5, which are
currently objected to and are pending examination. The Plaintiff has also
sought registration of the device mark                                       (‘PLANT
4.     The sales of the Plaintiff’s products since the year 2019 is claimed to
be Rs.5.95 crores, and the promotional expenses are claimed to be over Rs.4
crores. Various products of the Plaintiff have also been duly licenced under
The Drugs and Cosmetics Act, 1940.
5.     The grievance of the Plaintiff, in the present case, is that the
Defendant No.1 – Mr. Aayush Gupta, who is also running two entities which
are known by the names ‘Plant Powered’ and ‘Bo International’, applied for
the registration of the mark                     (PLANT POWERED) with a
flower logo. The said application was filed on 29th December, 2020 in Class
3 on a ‘proposed to be used’ basis. The said mark proceeded for registration
and the Plaintiff has now filed a rectification seeking cancellation of the said
6.     As per the Plaintiff, upon gaining knowledge of the said registration,
the Plaintiff conducted a market survey and found a number of Defendant’s
products on the e-commerce platform www.amazon.in (“Amazon”). The
details of the said products, along with product codes, and Amazon Standard
Identification Number (ASIN) are also set out in the plaint.
7.     Mr. Sethi, ld. Senior Counsel appearing for the Plaintiff has made the
i. A cease and desist notice was issued by the Plaintiff on 1st
February, 2022. However, the Defendant did not respond to the
same. Upon receiving the cease and desist notice, the Defendant
wrote a complaint to Amazon, raising a grievance against the
Plaintiff’s products, which resulted in an email being sent to the
Plaintiff on 8th February, 2022.      Subsequent emails were also
received from Amazon, and the Plaintiff’s products were delisted
from Amazon. Thus, the Defendant chose not to reply to the legal
notice, but parallelly, took action against the Plaintiff which had
addressed the legal notice to the Defendant. He submits that this
shows the mala fide and dishonest nature of the Defendant’s
conduct.
ii. The Defendant is also using the name ‘PLANT POWERED’ as a
trading    style  for    identical  goods.    The      domain           name
www.plantpowered.in has also been registered on 9th October,
2021. In view of the dates on which the trademark applications
were filed and the domain name was registered, it is submitted
that the Plaintiff is the prior user and adopter of the mark in
respect of identical products.
iii. It is also brought to the notice of this Court that the invoices which
have been placed on record by the Defendant to plead user in the
year 2020 are also completely manipulated and fabricated
inasmuch as the corresponding e-way bills, which can be
downloaded from the GST portal, would show that the mark
‘PLANT POWERED’ is not reflected in the corresponding e-way
bill. Thus, it is submitted that strict action is liable to be taken
against the Defendant for filing such manipulated and forged
documents.
iv. The website of the Defendant i.e., www.plantpowered.in, as on
21st February, 2022, merely mentioned ‘Opening Soon'. On the
website www.boessentialoil.com as well, there was no reflection
of any product by the name ‘PLANT POWERED’.
8.    On the other hand, Ms. Mukherjee, ld. Counsel on behalf of the
Defendant, makes the following submissions:
i. The term ‘PLANT POWERED’ is a descriptive mark and there
can be no monopoly over the same. There is no similarity between
the Plaintiff’s products and the Defendants’ products. The
products are clearly distinguishable as the house mark ‘MOTHER
SPARSH’ is used by the Plaintiff for its products. Reliance is
placed upon the judgments in Marico Limited v. Agro Tech
Foods Limited [174 (2010) DLT 279], Intex Technologies v.
7392] as also ITC Ltd. & Ors. v. Britannia Industries Ltd. [2021
SCC OnLine Del 1489] to argue that once there is a house mark
which a distinguishing factor between the two parties, if the
Defendant adds the name ‘Bo International’ or ‘Bio International’
as a prefix to their mark, it would be sufficient to distinguish the
Defendant’s products from the Plaintiff’s products. She further
submits that her client is willing to incorporate a hyphen between
the word ‘PLANT’ and ‘POWERED’ so that the same is clearly
distinguishable from the Plaintiff’s products.
ii. The gap between the adoption of the mark by the Plaintiff and the
Defendant is not too long. The Defendant having spent huge
amounts of money for promoting the products, the Defendant
should be permitted to use the mark ‘PLANT POWERED’ along
with the logo ‘Bio International’ or ‘Bo International’. In this
background, she submits that some distinguishable features can be
added which could distinguish the Defendant’s products with
Plaintiff’s products.
iii. She seeks to clarify and explain the discrepancy between the e-
way bills and the invoice by submitting that the ‘PLANT
POWERED’ name cannot be manually incorporated into the e-
way bill.
9.     Heard ld. Counsels for the parties. The question, in the present case,
relates to the use of the word and the mark ‘PLANT POWERED’. Upon a
perusal of the documents placed on record, prima facie, this Court is
convinced that the Plaintiff is the prior adopter and the user of the said mark
since the year 2019. The earliest document placed on record by the
Defendant is one of December, 2020, when the trademark application was
filed by the Defendant.
10.    It is further noticed that the product of the Defendant is not described
with any prefix on the website of Amazon. In fact, it is described as
‘PLANT POWERED’. Thus, it is clear that the mark ‘PLANT POWERED’
is being used as a trademark and not as a description of the products.
Moreover, the fact that the Defendant itself applied for the trademark
application and registration of the mark ‘PLANT POWERED’ means that
they are estopped from claiming that the same is the description of the
product. This is the settled legal position as per the judgement of this Court
in Automatic Electric Limited v. R. K. Dhawan & Ors. [77 (1999) DLT
292]. The relevant observations from the said judgment read as under:
“16. The defendants got their trade mark "DIMMER
DOT" registered in Australia. The fact that the
defendant itself has sought to claim trade proprietary
right and monopoly in "DIMMER DOT", it does not lie
in their mouth to say that the word "DIMMER" is a
generic expression. User of the word "DIMMER" by
others cannot be a defense available to the defendants,
if it could be shown that the same is being used in
violation of the statutory right of the plaintiff. In this
connection, reference may be made to the decision of this
Court in Prakash Road line Ltd. Vs. Prakash Parcel
Service (P) Ltd.; reported in 1992(2) Arbitration Law
Reporter page 174. Reference may also be made to the
decision in P.M. Diesels Ltd. Vs . S.M. Diesels; reported
in MANU/DE/0636/1994 : AIR1994Delhi264 . It was
held in those decision that if the plaintiff is a proprietor
of the registered trade mark, the same gives to the
proprietor of the registered trade mark the exclusive
right to use the trade mark with relation to goods in
respect of which the trade mark is registered under the
provisions of Section 28 of the Trade and Merchandise
Marks Act. It was also held that such statutory right
cannot be lost merely on the question of principles of
delay, laches or acquiescence. It was also held that in
general mere delay after knowledge of infringement does
not deprive the registered proprietor of a trade mark of
his statutory rights or of the appropriate remedy for the
enforcement of those rights so long as the said delay is
not an inordinate delay. In my considered opinion, the
ratio of the aforesaid decisions are squarely applicable
to the facts of the present case.”
11.   Similar is the view taken in Procter & Gamble Manufacturing
(Tianjin) Co. Ltd. and Ors. v. Anchor Health & Beauty Care Pvt. Ltd. [211
(2014) DLT 466], wherein it was held as under:
respondent/plaintiff not using the registered trade mark
"ALLROUND" owing to having suffixed it with the word
"PROTECTION"            is    concerned,    again,         the
appellants/defendants in the US, obtained registration of
the mark "ALL-AROUND PROTECTION" disclaiming
the word "PROTECTION". The same is indicative of the
appellants/defendants admitted that use of the word
"PROTECTION" as a suffix to the use of the registered
mark "ALL-AROUND" not negating the use of the trade
mark. The same reasoning, of approbate and reprobate,
applied by the learned Single Judge, in our opinion,
would apply to this aspect as well.
(xix) As far as the contention, of Automatic Electric Ltd.
(supra) having stood overruled by Marico Limited
(supra) is concerned, we have perused Indian Hotels
Company Ltd. (supra) and are unable to agree that the
reference therein to Automatic Electric Ltd. is without
affirming the same. It was the contention in Indian
Hotels Company Ltd. also that the word "JIVA" therein
was a descriptive word which could not be protected as a
trade mark. The Division Bench however negated the
said argument by holding that the appellant therein
having itself applied for registration of "JIVA" as a trade
mark, could not argue that the mark was descriptive.
Reference to Automatic Electric Ltd. was made in
support of the said reasoning. Unfortunately, neither
Automatic Electric Ltd. nor Indian Hotels Company Ltd.
were noticed in the subsequent judgment of the Division
Bench in Marico Limited. We, at this interim stage are
inclined to go along with the affirmation by the Division
Bench in Indian Hotels Company Ltd. with the view in
12.    The sales of the Plaintiff have been sworn on affidavit and have been
placed on record. On the other hand, due to the various discrepancies in the
invoices which have been highlighted by the Plaintiff, the sales of the
Defendant are not clear at this stage. It appears that there is also some
manipulation of the e-way bill and tax invoice which has been placed on
record. On the one hand, the tax invoices claim that the products sold are of
‘PLANT POWERED’, whereas in the e-way bill, there is no mention of the
13.    The words ‘PLANT’ and ‘POWER’ by themselves, when considered
as standalone words, may be descriptive. However, when used in
conjunction with each other for identical products, there is likely to be
confusion between the Plaintiff’s products and Defendant’s products, as is
clear from the invoices which are placed on record by the ld. Counsel for the
Defendant even today.
14.    In this regard, the observations of the Supreme Court in Godfrey
Philips India Ltd. v. Girnar Food and Beverages Pvt. Ltd. [(2004) 5 SCC
257] are relevant. The said observations reads as under:
“4. Without going into the question whether the
conclusion arrived at by the Division Bench that the
trade mark is descriptive is correct or not, it appears to
us, and as is conceded by both parties before us, that the
enunciation of principle of law with regard to the
protection available even in respect of the descriptive
trade mark was wrong. A descriptive trade mark may be
entitled to protection if it has assumed a secondary
meaning which identifies it with a particular product or
as being from a particular source. We, therefore,
remand the matter back to the Division Bench of the
High Court so that it may address its mind to this
question without disturbing the other conclusions arrived
at this stage. In the event, the Division Bench answers
the additional issue formulated by us against the
appellant, it will be open to the appellant to raise all the
issues which have already been concluded and which are
the subject matter of this appeal in any further appeal as
it may be entitled to prefer from the final decision of the
Division Bench. The Division Bench is directed to
dispose of the appeal as expeditiously as is conveniently
possible. It is made clear that the trial of the suit may
also be proceeded with and concluded expeditiously
without being inhibited either by the pendency of the
appeal or by any observation in the orders of the High
Court on the interlocutory application.”
15.   This principle of law has been reiterated by the Bombay High Court
in Sky Enterprise Private Ltd. v. Abaad Masala & Co. [2020 (5) ABR 500]
“8. It is not in dispute that the Plaintiff not only has
trademark registrations both for the device and word
marks using the words 'Star Zing', such as 'Star Zing
White Chinese Pepper Masala' and 'Star Zing Black
Chinese Pepper Masala', but even for the word marks
'White Chinese Pepper Masala' and 'Black Chinese
Pepper Masala' themselves, as separate and distinct
registrations, and as of the date of this interim
application, these registrations are very much valid and
subsisting. If that is so, the Plaintiff is prima facie
entitled to an interim injunction restraining the world at
large from using these trademarks in connection with
similar goods, unless the registration of these trademarks
by the Plaintiffs can be shown to be demonstrably or ex
facie illegal or fraudulent or shocking to the conscience
of the Court. As noted by our Full Bench in Lupin
Limited (Supra), the object of providing for registration
of a trademark is to obviate the difficulty in proving in
each and every case the plaintiff's title to the trademark;
this object is achieved by raising a strong presumption in
law as to the validity of the registration and conversely,
by casting a heavy burden on the defendant to question
such validity or rebut such presumption at the
interlocutory stage. It is not sufficient for the Defendant
in such a case to show that he has an arguable case in
support of invalidity of the registration. Even prima facie
satisfaction of the Court for stay of a trial under Section
124 of the Act is not enough to refuse such injunction.
There is only a small window for opposing grant of such
injunction, in the form of three exceptional
circumstances, as noted by the Full Bench in Lupin
Limited (Supra), namely, (i) ex facie illegality of
registration, or (ii) fraudulent registration or (iii)
registration that would shock the conscience of the
Court. It is only through this small window that the
Defendant can successfully defend his use of the
infringing word/s. All that is alleged in support of such
plea in the present case is that the marks consist of
descriptive words. In the first place, it is not in any and
every case, where the words forming part of a
trademark are descriptive, that the applicant for
registration is not entitled to it. Individual words in a
given case may be descriptive, but their peculiar
combination may yet create a unique appearance or
identity. Secondly, by virtue of a long history of trading,
it is quite possible that the mark, though it contains
descriptive words, may have come to acquire a
distinctive reputation and association with the
Plaintiff's product alone and with no others. In all
these cases, it is perfectly legitimate to obtain a
registration and prevent use of identical or deceptively
similar marks by others, in spite of the descriptive
words forming part of the Plaintiff's trademark. Indeed,
as the Supreme Court has observed in Godfrey Philips
India Ltd. vs. Girnar Food and Beverages Pvt. Ltd.
MANU/SC/0541/2004, a descriptive trademark may
well be entitled to protection, if it has come to assume a
secondary meaning, which identifies a particular
product or products as coming from a particular
source.
9. In the Plaintiff's case here, each individual word
forming part of its registered trademark may well be a
descriptive word; it may not be possible to claim any
proprietary right over it; but no rival trader can use the
particular combination and order in which the Plaintiff
uses these words in its registered trademark to
distinguish its goods, if the particular combination or
order is not generally used in the trade for describing
the character or quality of goods. A rival trader, for
example, in the present case, may describe his product
as 'pepper masala'; he may describe it as 'Chinese
masala', he may even call it 'black masala', if that is the
colour of its product; he may even write on the label
that the product is a black masala made of pepper and
is for Chinese cookery. But he surely cannot describe
his goods as 'White Chinese Pepper Masala' or 'Black
Chinese Pepper Masala', using the very same
combination and order of words, which form the
registered trademarks of the Plaintiff. Secondly, the
Plaintiff has an arguable claim to registration of these
trademarks, though they may be in a broad sense
descriptive, on the footing that through their extensive
use as trademarks for sale and promotion of its goods,
the trademarks have come to acquire a distinctive
reputation and association with its goods and no others.
There is even material in the plaint to indicate that. The
Plaintiff had initially registered its trademarks 'Star Zing
White Chinese Pepper Masala' and 'Star Zing Black
Chinese Pepper Masala' as far back as in 2012. Between
the years 2012-2013 and 2015-2016, the Plaintiff's goods
under the trademarks 'Star Zing White Chinese Pepper
Masala' and 'Star Zing Black Chinese Pepper Masala'
were extensively sold in the market, the sales rising
progressively and exponentially and finally reaching to
the tune of over Rs. 12.38 crores in the year 2015-2016
for 'Star Zing White Chinese Pepper Masala' and in the
same year, of over Rs. 4.40 crores for 'Star Zing Black
Chinese Pepper Masala'. It is possible to say that by that
year, the words 'White Chinese Pepper Masala' and
'Black Chinese Pepper Masala' themselves had obtained
a secondary meaning and association with the Plaintiff's
goods and with no others. In fact, presumably in the light
of this circumstance, in the year 2015-2016, the Plaintiff
appears to have made an application for registration of
word marks 'White Chinese Pepper Masala' and 'Black
Chinese Pepper Masala' as separate word marks citing
their user since 2012, and indeed, on that basis, even
obtained registration from the Trademarks Registry. If
that is so, it is permissible to term the words, in their
peculiar combination and order, as distinctive, that is to
say, as having acquired a secondary meaning and seek
their registration as trademarks. Prima facie it is not
possible to claim such registration as either ex facie
illegal or fraudulent or shocking to the conscience of the
16.   Similar is the view taken by the ld. Single Judge of this Court in
Natures Essence Private Limited v. Protogreen Retail Solutions Private
Limited and Ors. [2021 (86) PTC 225 (Del)]. The relevant paragraphs are
“46.8. The contention, of Mr. Sharma, that the plaintiff
cannot claim any trademark rights over the word
"Nature", as it is descriptive in nature, is neither here
nor there. In the first place, the plaintiffs trademark, of
which it alleges infringement, is not "NATURE" per se,
but "NATURE'S INC." or "NATURE'S ESSENCE". As I
have already held hereinbefore, the defendant's mark is,
visually and phonetically, deceptively similar to the
plaintiff's "NATURE'S INC." mark, and conveys a
deceptively similar idea to that conveyed by "NATURE'S
ESSENCE", as has the potential of confusing a customer
of average intelligence and imperfect recollection.
Whether an intellectual property monopoly can be
claimed in respect of the word "NATURE" is, therefore,
really off the mark. It would be totally antithetical to all
canons of trademark jurisprudence to question the
validity of the or marks because Nature is a descriptive
word. Once "Nature's" is used in conjunction with
"Inc.", or "Essence", it assumes a definite and distinct-
as well as distinctive-connotation and meaning, which
is totally different from "Nature" per se. Even if "Inc."
were to be treated as an acronym for Incorporated, the
mark has a distinctive identity all its own, immediately
apparent to the naked eye. Once, therefore, deceptive
similarity is established, violation of the proprietorial
right, of the plaintiff, over the or trademark, stands
made out. Infringement being in the nature of a
violation of the proprietorial right of the owner of a
registered trade mark, a case of infringement stands,
thereby, prima facie established.”
17.    Similarly in Living Media India Limited v. Jitender V. Jain & Ors.
[98 (2002) DLT 430], a ld. Single Judge of this Court has observed as under:
“25. The word trade mark has been defined as a
registered trade mark or a mark used in relation to
goods for the purpose of indicating so as to indicate a
connection in the course of trade between the goods and
some person having the right as proprietor to use the
mark. If any mark is used in relation to goods for the
purpose of indicating or so as to indicate and some
person having the right as proprietor it is a trade mark
which becomes the property of its prior user even if it
happens to be descriptive in nature but has been coined
by it.
26. The mark is always used for the purpose of indicating
either a connection in the course of trade between the
goods and it is the prior user which provides the right of
protection. Thus even if the adjective "Khabrein" is pre-
fixed it does not make the trade mark "Khabrein Aaj
Tak" distinct or different from the mark "AAJ TAK".
27. The word "AAJ TAK" itself is no distinctive that it
has acquired such a meaning that any pre-fix of suffix
would be of no relevance so far as the action of passing
of is concerned. The only object and design of the
defendant to adopt the word "AAJ TAK" was to trade and
encash upon the goodwill of the plaintiff earned over the
years through the advertisements and because of its
extensive popularity. The mark "AAJ TAK" has become
synonymous with the plaintiff so far as the news channel
is concerned.
28. The word "AAJ" and "TAK" may be individually
descriptive and dictionary word and may not be
monopolised by any person but their combination does
provide a protection as a trademark if it has been in
long, prior and continuous user in relation to particular
goods manufactured, sold by a particular person and by
virtue of such user the mark gets identified with that
person. It is so irrespective of the fact whether such a
combination is descriptive in nature and has even a
dictionary meaning. In such a case any other person
may choose any of the two words viz. either "AAJ" or
"TAK" as its trade name or mark but it has to prohibited
from using the combination of these words as such a user
not only creates confusion as to its source or origin but
also bares the design or motive of its subsequent adopter.
29. Any kind of prefix or suffix would not make any
difference so far as the trade name or for that purpose
the domain name "AAJ TAK" is concerned. It is
immaterial whether the defendant has no clientele or
publication in Delhi. Channel "AAJ TAK" is a National
Channel. It has widespread reputation and goodwill.
Adoption of similar or deceptively similar mark amounts
to passing off even if it has no local physical market,
goodwill or reputation of a product or person is all
pervasive. It is not confined in the four walls or to a
particular territory. It has to be protected wherever it is
threatened or is sought to be eroded or exploited. Merely
because the product or mark adopted by a rival has no
circulation or sale in the territory of the plaintiff's mark
or product is no defense against protection of the mark.
Protection of mark is in actuality protection of reputation
and goodwill. At every cost the reputation has to be
protected and preserved.”
18.    In the opinion of this Court, both parties are selling the same kind of
products. The mark of the Plaintiff is used prominently on its products. The
Plaintiff is clearly the prior adopter and user of the mark. The Defendant’s
conduct is far from bona fide as the user documents of 2020 filed by the
Defendant do not inspire confidence at this stage. The Defendant not only
uses the mark ‘PLANT POWERED’ as a mark but also as a trading style.
When a search is conducted for a product of this nature on any e-commerce
platform, it is normal for a user to type the words ‘PLANT POWERED’ in
order to search for the product. If such a search is carried out, it would
automatically throw up the results with the Plaintiff’s and Defendant’s
product, which ought to be avoided.
19.    In light of the facts and circumstances of the present case, the ex parte
injunction granted on 24th February, 2022 is confirmed. The Defendant shall
stand injuncted during the pendency of the present suit, from using the mark
‘PLANT POWERED’ conjunctively in relation to baby care or personal care
products or any other goods falling under Classes 3 and 5, including but not
limited to, face wash, face cream, shampoo, etc., and/or such allied and
cognate goods. This would, however, not preclude the Defendant from using
the word ‘PLANT’ and ‘POWER’ separately in a manner, so as to not cause
any deception and confusion to the consumers, with the Plaintiff’s mark
20.     As is evident from the packaging of the Defendant’s products, the
products are shown to be marketed by ‘PLANT POWERED’. Thus,
henceforth, the Defendant shall also not use the trading style ‘PLANT
POWERED’ as an entity. The domain name ‘plantpowered.in’ shall also
stand injuncted during the pendency of the present suit.
21.     Insofar as discrepancy between the e-way bills and tax invoices, as
elaborated above, is concerned, the Plaintiff is permitted to move an
application seeking appropriate reliefs against the Defendant in this regard.
22.     I.A. 3107/2022 is disposed of, in the above terms.
23.     This is an application filed by the Plaintiff seeking appointment of
Local Commissioner. Application is not pressed at this stage.
24.     I.A. 3108/2022 is disposed of.
25.     Written statements be filed in accordance with the timelines of the
Commercial Courts Act, 2015, along with documents. Replication be also
26.     List before the Registrar for completion of pleadings and marking of
exhibits, on 28th April, 2022.
