P.I. Mr.Vikramsinh Kadam attached to Badlapur East P. Stn. present.
Mr.S.V.Gavand, APP for the State in BA 2057/22.
Mrs.A.A.Takalkar, APP for the State in BA 2058/22.
1.      These two applications are filed by the same applicant Shri Sagar
Vilas Tote who is charged for committing offences punishable under
Sections 406 and 420 of the IPC read with Section 3 of the Maharashtra
Protection of Interest of Depositors (In Financial Establishments) Act,
1999. Two distinct C.R.s came to be registered against him; C.R. I-
64/2018 was registered with Bazar Peth Police Station, whereas C.R. I-
11/2018 came to be registered with Badlapur East Police Station. He
came to be arrested in both the C.R.s in the month of June 2018. On
completion of investigation, charge-sheet bearing no. MPID No.01 of
2018 and MPID No.02 of 2018 was filed before the Additional Sessions
2.    The prosecution alleged that as far as C.R. registered with
Badlapur Police Station is concerned, the total investment with the
assured interest has been worked out to be Rs.1,07,95,000/-.            The
learned counsel for the applicant makes a categorical statement that out
of the amount received by him by way of investment from 15 investors,
he has refunded an approximate amount of Rs.25,22,300/-. As far as
the C.R. registered with Bazar Peth Police Station is concerned which
involves 82 investors, the total amount as per the charge-sheet is worked
out at Rs.4,73,23,260/-. The learned counsel for the applicant makes a
categorical statement by referring to the statements of several victims
which are part of the charge-sheet that he has cleared Rs.2,75,00,000/-
in favour of some of the aggrieved investors the victims in the subject
C.R. The investigation is complete and the charge-sheet is filed.
3.    The learned counsel for the applicant seeks his release on two
counts; firstly, on completion of investigation, further incarceration of
the applicant is unnecessary and secondly, he seeks to derive benefit of
Section 436-A of the Cr. P.C. which according to him, entitle him to be
released on bail since on the date of his arrest, he has undergone
imprisonment of four years and three months and the maximum penalty,
which would be imposed upon him on he being convicted for the
offences punishable under Sections 406 and 420 of the IPC read with
Section 3 of the Maharashtra Protection of Interest of Depositors (In
Financial Establishments) Act, 1999, would be of seven years.
The learned counsel for the applicant placed reliance on the latest
decision of the Apex Court in case of Satender Kumar Antil Vs. Central
Bureau of Investigation & Anr. 1 as well as the decision in case of Bhim
Singh Vs. Union of India2 and the decision in case of Hussainara
Khatoon and Others (IV) Vs. Home Secretary, State of Bihar, Patna3.
The learned APP Mr. Gavand and Ms. Takalkar have filed their
respective affidavits and the relief of being released by taking recourse
to Section 436-A of the Cr. P.c. is opposed on the grounds that the
offence involved is serious as the applicant has defrauded several
investors and the amount runs into crores of rupees and since no
property is available for attachment by the police, he do not deserve his
release on bail though admittedly he has undergone imprisonment of
more than four years and three months and the maximum period of
imprisonment which could be imposed upon him by way of punishment
is seven years.
4.     Section 436-A of the Cr. P.C. prescribe the maximum period for
1 Miscellaneous Application No. 1849 of 2021
which an under-trial prisoner can be detained and it has been inserted
by Act 25 of 2005 with effect from 23 June, 2006.                The provision
prescribe the maximum period for which under trial prisoner can be
detained and it read thus:-
“436A- Maximum period for which an under trial prisoner can
be detained.-
Where a person has, during the period of investigation, inquiry
or trial under this Code of an offence under any law (not being
an offence for which the punishment of death has been
specified as one of the punishments under that law) undergone
detention for a period extending up to one-half of the
maximum period of imprisonment specified for that offence
under that law, he shall be released by the Court on his
personal bond with or without sureties;
Provided that the Court may, after hearing the Public
Prosecutor and for reasons to be recorded by it in writing,
order the continued detention of such person for a period
longer than one-half of the said period or release him on bail
instead of the personal bond with or without sureties;
Provided further that no such person shall in any case be
detained during the period of investigation inquiry or trial for
more than the maximum period of imprisonment provided for
the said offence under that law.”
5.    As early as in 1980, the right of under-trial prisoners was
recognized by the Hon’ble Apex Court in a decision of Hussainara
Khatoon and Others (IV) Vs. Home Secretary, State of Bihar, Patna
(supra) and speedy trial was reckoned as an essential ingredient of
‘reasonable fair and just’ procedure guaranteed by Article 21 of the
Constitution.    Hon’ble Justice Shri P. N. Bhagwati (as he was then)
underlined the constitutional mandate to provide speedy trial in the
“"Not only those precedents but also reason and reflection
require us to recognise that in our adversary system of criminal
justice, any person haled into court, who is too poor to hire a
lawyer cannot be assured a fair trial unless counsel is provided
for him. This seems to us to be an obvious truth. Governments,
both State and Federal quite properly spend vast sums of
money to establish machinery to try defendants accused of
crime. Lawyers to prosecute are everywhere deemed essential
to protect the public's interest in an orderly society. Similarly,
there are few defendants charged with crime who fail to hire
the best lawyers they can get to prepare and present their
defences. That government hires lawyers to prosecute and
defendants who have the money hire lawyers to defend are the
strongest indications of the widespread belief that lawyers in
criminal courts are necessities, not luxuries. The right of one
charged with crime to counsel may not be deemed fundamental
and essential to fair trials in some countries, but is in ours.
From the very beginning, our state and national constitutions
and laws have laid great emphasis on procedural and
substantive safeguards designed to assure fair trials before
impartial tribunals in which every defendant stands equal
before the law. This noble idea cannot be realised if the poor
man charged with crime has to face his accusers without a
lawyer to assist him."
6.     In case of Bhim Singh Vs. Union of India (supra), once again the
principle was reiterated with its emphasis on Section 436A of the Cr.P.C.
where jurisdictional Magistrate/Chief Judicial Magistrate/Sessions
Judge were directed to hold one sitting in a week in each jail/prison for
a limited time so that effect can be given to Section 436A of the Cr.P.C.
Once again in the latest decision in case of Satender Kumar Antil Vs.
Central Bureau of Investigation & Anr. (supra) while recognizing liberty
to be one of the most essential requirements of the modern man, and
quintessence of civilized existence, the highest Court of this country
interpreted the said provision and reiterated its earlier decision in case
of Bhim Singh Vs. Union of India (supra) while recognizing that the said
provision is a substantive one, facilitating liberty, being the core
intendment of Article 21. The Hon’ble Apex Court observed thus:-
“46. Section 436A of the Code has been inserted by Act 25 of
2005. This provision has got a laudable object behind it,
particularly from the point of view of granting bail. This
provision draws the maximum period for which an undertrial
prisoner can be detained. This period has to be reckoned with
the custody of the accused during the investigation, inquiry
and trial. We have already explained that the word ‘trial’ will
have to be given an expanded meaning particularly when an
appeal or admission is pending. Thus, in a case where an
appeal is pending for a longer time, to bring it under Section
436A, the period of incarceration in all forms will have to be
reckoned, and so also for the revision.
47. Under this provision, when a person has undergone
detention for a period extending to one-half of the maximum
period of imprisonment specified for that offense, he shall be
released by the court on his personal bond with or without
sureties. The word ‘shall’ clearly denotes the mandatory
compliance of this provision. We do feel that there is not even
a need for a bail application in a case of this nature
particularly when the reasons for delay are not attributable
against the accused. We are also conscious of the fact that
while taking a decision the public prosecutor is to be heard,
and the court, if it is of the view that there is a need for
continued detention longer than one-half of the said period,
has to do so. However, such an exercise of power is expected to
be undertaken sparingly being an exception to the general
rule. Once again, we have to reiterate that ‘bail is the rule and
jail is an exception’ coupled with the principle governing the
presumption of innocence. We have no doubt in our mind that
this provision is a substantive one, facilitating liberty, being the
core intendment of Article 21. The only caveat as furnished
under the Explanation being the delay in the proceeding
caused on account of the accused to be excluded. This court in
Bhim Singh v. Union of India, (2015) 13 SCC 605, while
dealing with the aforesaid provision, has directed that:
“5. Having given our thoughtful consideration to the
legislative policy engrafted in Section 436-A and large
number of undertrial prisoners housed in the prisons, we
are of the considered view that some order deserves to
be passed by us so that the undertrial prisoners do not
continue to be detained in prison beyond the maximum
period provided under Section 436-A.
6. We, accordingly, direct that jurisdictional Magistrate/
Chief Judicial Magistrate/Sessions Judge shall hold one
sitting in a week in each jail/prison for two months
commencing from 1-10-2014 for the purposes of
effective implementation of Section 436-A of the Code of
Criminal Procedure. In its sittings in jail, the above
judicial officers shall identify the undertrial prisoners
who have completed half period of the maximum period
or maximum period of imprisonment provided for the
said offence under the law and after complying with the
procedure prescribed under Section 436-A pass an
appropriate order in jail itself for release of such
undertrial prisoners who fulfill the requirement of
Section 436-A for their release immediately. Such
jurisdictional Magistrate/Chief Judicial Magistrate/
Sessions Judge shall submit the report of each of such
sittings to the Registrar General of the High Court and at
the end of two months, the Registrar General of each
High Court shall submit the report to the Secretary
General of this Court without any delay. To facilitate
compliance with the above order, we direct the Jail
Superintendent of each jail/prison to provide all
necessary facilities for holding the court sitting by the
above judicial officers. A copy of this order shall be sent
to the Registrar General of each High Court, who in turn
will communicate the copy of the order to all Sessions
Judges within his State for necessary compliance.”
Their Lordships of the Apex Court emphasis that the directions
issued by the Court if not complied fully, are expected to be complied
with in order to prevent the unnecessary incarceration of under-trials,
and to uphold the inviolable principle of presumption of innocence until
proven guilty.
7.    In the light of the aforesaid pronouncement as above, which has
enunciated the scope of Section 436A of the Cr.P.C., I do not think that
the seriousness of the accusation would deny him the benefit flowing
from the said section, when his case squarely falls within sub-section (1)
of Section 436A, on having undergone more than half of the period of
maximum imprisonment, which would be imposed upon him by way of
penalty, assuming that he will be convicted for the offences with which
he is charged. The applicant deserves his release on bail. Hence the
(a)         Applications are allowed.
(b)        Applicant - Sagar Vilas Tote shall be released on bail in
connection with distinct C.R.s i.e. (i) C.R. I-64/2018 registered
with Bazar Peth Police Station and (ii) C.R. I-11/2018 registered
with Badlapur East Police Station on furnishing P.R. Bond to the
extent of Rs.15,000/- each with one or two sureties in the like
amount.
(c)        The applicant shall mark his attendance before the
concerned police station on first Monday of every trimester.
(d)        The applicant shall not directly or indirectly make any
inducement, threat or promise to any person acquainted with the
facts of the case so as to dissuade him from disclosing the facts to
Court or any Police Officer. The applicant shall not tamper with
evidence.
(e)       On being released on bail, the applicant shall furnish his
contact number and residential address to the Investigating Officer
and shall keep him updated, in case there is any change.
