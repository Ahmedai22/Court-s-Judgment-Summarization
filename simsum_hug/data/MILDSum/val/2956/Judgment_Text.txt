The case of the plaintiff is that the first defendant was given the licence by the
second defendant Municipality to run a flower shop. The plaintiff seems to have entered
into an agreement with the second defendant on 17.02.1996, marked as Ex.A.1. As per
this agreement, the plaintiff claims to have been put in possession of the shop and he
had paid the consideration of nearly Rs.1,00,000/-. The further case of the plaintiff is
that the defendant agreed to effect the change of name for the shop by making an
application to the second defendant Municipality, in the name of the plaintiff. Till this
process is completed, the plaintiff had agreed to pay the monthly rent to the second
defendant Municipality in the name of the first defendant.
2. The grievance of the plaintiff is that the first defendant acted against the
agreement and attempted to interfere with the possession and enjoyment of the suit
property. Left with no other alternative, the suit came to be filed seeking for the relief of
permanent injunction against the first defendant.
3. The first defendant filed a written statement and took a stand that the suit
property belongs to the second defendant Municipality and the so called agreement
marked as Ex.A.1 was a created document. The first defendant virtually questioned the
very right of the plaintiff to seek for the relief of permanent injunction and accordingly
he sought for the dismissal of the suit.
4. Both the Courts below, on considering the facts and circumstances of the case
and on appreciation of oral and documentary evidence, concurrently held against the
plaintiff and dismissed the suit.       Aggrieved by the same, the plaintiff has filed this
Second Appeal before this Court.
5. One important development that had taken place during the pendency of this
Second Appeal is that the first defendant who was the first respondent in the Second
Appeal died and in his place his legal representatives have been impleaded as
respondents 3 to 5.
6. Heard Mr.C.P.Sivamohan, learned counsel for the appellant, Mr.D.Gopal,
learned counsel for the second respondent and Mr.Jaseem Mudassar Ali, learned counsel
for the respondents 3 to 5. This Court also carefully perused the materials available on
record and the findings of both the Courts below.
7. Both the Courts below concurrently held that the shop was allotted in favour of
the first defendant by the second defendant Municipality and whatever documents were
filed and relied upon by the plaintiff stood in the name of the first defendant. Both the
Courts also found that Ex.A.1 agreement cannot be acted upon and there was absolutely
no proof to show that the plaintiff is in possession and enjoyment of the suit property.
The Courts below also took into consideration the evidence of P.W.1 and questioned the
manner in which the possession was taken over by the plaintiff.               On a cumulative
consideration of the oral and documentary evidence, both the Courts held that the
plaintiff did not establish legal possession in the suit property and that he will not be
entitled for possession when the shop was allotted in the name of the first defendant by
the second defendant Municipality. The Courts below also found that the plaintiff was
claiming for possession in a property which admittedly belongs to the second respondent
8. The demise of the first respondent / first defendant in the Second Appeal has a
lot of significance in the present case. A careful reading of the pleadings shows that the
entire allegation about the attempt being made to interfere with the possession and
enjoyment of the suit property has been made against the first defendant in his
individual capacity.       The relief of permanent injunction sought for with a specific
allegation made against a particular person who is shown as the defendant in the suit,
must confine to that person. It is under these circumstances, the legal maxim Actio
personalis moritur cum persona comes into play. The Hon'ble Supreme Court had
an occasion to deal with this issue in Prabhakara Adiga vs Gowri And Others
reported in (2017) 2 CTC Page 208.                While dealing with this issue, the Hon'ble
Supreme Court held that the Actio personalis moritur cum persona principle will
apply when the decree relates to a class of action which is individual centric and the
relief is focussed upon the wrong committed by that person. This principle will not apply
where the decree relates to a property or a right which is heritable by the legal
representatives and which is partible and it would bind the legal representatives also.
The relevant portions in the judgment are extracted hereunder.
“14. Normally personal action dies with person but this principle
has application to limited kinds of causes of actions. In
Girijanandini Devi v. Bijendra Narain Choudhary AIR 1967 SC 1124,
this Court while considering the question whether the decree for
account can be passed against the estates, also considered the
maxim actio personalis moritur cum persona and observed that the
postulation that personal action dies with the person, has a limited
application. It operates in a limited class of actions, such as actions
for damages, assault or other personal injuries not causing the
death of the party and in other actions where after the death of the
party the relief granted could not be enjoyed or granting it would
be nugatory. Death of the person liable to render the account for
property received by him does not therefore affect the liability of
his estate.
26. In our considered opinion the right which had been adjudicated
in the suit in the present matter and the findings which have been
recorded as basis for grant of injunction as to the disputed property
which is heritable and partible would enure not only to the benefit
of the legal heir of decree-holders but also would bind the legal
representatives of the judgment-debtor. It is apparent from section
50 CPC that when a judgment- debtor dies before the decree has
been satisfied, it can be executed against legal representatives.
Section 50 is not confined to a particular kind of decree. Decree for
injunction can also be executed against legal representatives of the
deceased judgment-debtor. The maxim actio personalis moritur
cum persona is limited to certain class of cases as indicated by this
Court in Girijanandini Devi v. Bijendra Narain Choudhary (supra)
and when the right litigated upon is heritable, the decree would not
normally abate and can be enforced by LRs. of decree-holder and
against the judgment-debtor or his legal representatives. It would
be against the public policy to ask the decree-holder to litigate
once over again against the legal representatives of the judgment-
debtor when the cause and injunction survives. No doubt, it is true
that a decree for injunction normally does not run with the land. In
the absence of statutory provisions it cannot be enforced.
However, in view of the specific provisions contained in section 50
CPC, such a decree can be executed against legal representatives.”
9. In the present case, the licence was granted by the second respondent
Municipality specifically in the name of the first defendant to run the flower business in a
shop.        Such a licence comes to an end on the death of the allottee and it is not a
heritable right for the legal representatives to inherit such a right of licence immediately
on the death of the first defendant.         In such circumstances, the allegation that was
made by the plaintiff should confine itself to the first defendant and on the death of the
first defendant, the cause of action also automatically dies and thereafter there is
nothing much that could be decided in the case.         This will apply mostly in cases where
relief of permanent injunction is involved and it is relatable to the individual acts of a
person, which gave rise to the filing of the suit.
10. In view of the above discussion, this Court finds that the cause of action that
was pleaded in the suit as against the first defendant came to an end on the death of the
first defendant applying of the Actio personalis moritur cum persona principle.
Thereafter, it will depend upon the action taken by the second defendant Municipality for
allotment of the shop. If during this process, relief is granted in favour of the plaintiff, it
will virtually amount to injuncting the Municipality to proceed further with the allotment
of the shop. This is more so since the legal representatives of the first defendant do not
have any automatic right of being granted licence by the second defendant Municipality.
In such peculiar circumstances, this Court does not want to deal with the findings of
both the Courts below.         This Second Appeal can be disposed of merely on the ground
that the cause of action no longer survives. In any event, this Court does not find any
substantial substantial question of law involved in this Second Appeal.
11. In the result, the Second Appeal is disposed of in the above terms. However,
considering the facts and circumstances of the case, there shall be no order as to costs.
Consequently, connected miscellaneous petition is closed.
