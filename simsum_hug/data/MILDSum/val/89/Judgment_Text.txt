This appeal filed under Section 37 of the Arbitration and Conciliation
Act, 1996 (the Act), is against the order dated 04.12.2017 in O.P.(Arb.)
No.105/2015 of the District Court, Kasaragod.
2.    The appellant herein is the petitioner before the court below and
the claimant before the Arbitral Tribunal (AT). The respondent herein is the
respondent before the court below and the respondent before the AT. The
parties in this appeal will be referred to as described in the arbitral
3.    The respondent awarded the work of ‘doubling of track between
Shornur and Mangalore, Cannanore-Uppala section: collection and stacking
of 50mm size machine crushed hard stone ballast alongside the
alignment/station yards/ on top of the new formation between Kottikulam
and Kasaragod stations (Balance works)’ to the claimant on 19.09.2000 for a
value of ₹ 1,19,39,274/-.     Letter of Acceptance (LoA) was issued on
19.09.2000. The work was to be completed within a period of nine months,
that is, by 18.06.2001. Alleging breach on the part of the claimant, the
contract was terminated by the respondent before the expiry of the
completion period.      Disputes arose between the parties. Arbitration
proceedings was initiated. The AT consisting of three Arbitrators passed an
award on 24.04.2015. The AT disallowed all the claims of the claimant
except claim no. 1 for release of an amount of ₹ 3,46,959/-, which amount
had been forfeited by the respondent towards risk liability amount. This
claim was partly allowed to the tune of ₹ 46,959/-. All the other claims
including the prayer for return of the Earnest Money Deposit (EMD) was
rejected. Aggrieved, the claimant/contractor took up the matter before the
District Court. The said Original Application filed under s.34 of the Act was
dismissed by the impugned order.
4.    Heard Shri.Rahul Varghese, the learned counsel for the
appellant and Shri.Ananthakrishnan, the learned Standing Counsel for the
5.    In the appeal memorandum it is stated that during the pendency
of the proceeding before the court below, the respondent released the EMD
amounting to ₹50,000/-. This according to the claimant has been done when
the respondent realized that it was illegal for them to have withheld the
same, especially when they had not suffered any loss or damage. Therefore,
the only point to be decided in this appeal is whether there is any infirmity in
the finding of the AT that the respondent is entitled to forfeit the security
deposit of ₹ 3 lakhs towards risk liability in the absence of any loss or
damage. According to the AT, the claimant had failed to execute the work
and hence the contract had been terminated at his risk and cost in terms of
Clause 62 of the General Conditions of Contract. An amount of ₹ 3 lakhs
deposited as security deposit and an amount of ₹ 46,959/- towards
advertisement charges had been deducted by the respondent from the final
bill as the amount towards risk liability. The AT concluded that since the
breach of the contract had been committed by the claimant/contractor, the
security deposit of ₹ 3 lakhs is liable to be forfeited and therefore out of the
total amount of ₹3,46,959/- claimed by the claimant, only an amount of ₹
46,959/- was allowed. However, in the award itself it is stated that no
loss/damage had been caused to the respondent. Therefore, it is submitted
by the learned counsel for the claimant/contractor that in such circumstances
the forfeiture of ₹3 lakhs deposited as security deposit is patently wrong,
illegal and perverse. Reference was made to the decisions in Fateh Chand
vs. Balkishan Dass [1963 SC 1405]; State of Kerala vs. United Shippers
and Dredgers Ltd. [AIR 1982 Ker 281]; Abdulla vs. State of Kerala
[2001 KHC 822] and Kailash Nath Associates vs. Delhi Development
Authority [(2015)4 SCC 136] in support of this argument.
6.     Here we need to refer to Sections 73 and 74 of the Indian
“74 Compensation for breach of contract where penalty stipulated
for:-[When a contract has been broken, if a sum is named in the
contract as the amount to be paid in case of such breach, or if the
contract contains any other stipulation by way of penalty, the party
complaining of the breach is entitled, whether or not actual damage or
loss is proved to have been caused thereby, to receive from the party
who has broken the contract reasonable compensation not exceeding
the amount so named or, as the case may be, the penalty stipulated
for.”
7.      As laid down in the aforesaid decisions, in a case coming under
Section 74, it is not necessary for the party claiming compensation under
this Section to prove that actual damage or loss has been caused. Then the
question is whether even in the absence of legal injury, compensation is
liable to be paid for breach simplicitor. Under Section 74, whether it is a
case of liquidated damages or penalty, what the party faced with the breach
gets is only reasonable compensation, subject to the limit of the amount
stipulated in the contract itself. Section 74 dispenses with proof of the extent
of real or actual or factual loss or damage, but provides for grant of
reasonable compensation, subject to the condition that it shall not exceed the
sum stipulated as penalty in the contract. The proof of the extent of loss or
damage suffered in fact, i.e., proof of the extent of actual damage or loss
suffered is dispensed with in Section 74. This would not mean that there
need not be any loss or damage. What is meant is only that proof of actual
damage or loss is not necessary.
8.   In the case on hand, it cannot be Section 74 that could have
been invoked, because the Award does not say that any sum has been named
in the contract as the amount to be paid in case of breach. In other words,
the parties had never made a genuine pre-estimate of the amount to be paid
in the event of any damage or loss likely to be caused by the breach or that
there is any clause relating to liquidated damages in the contract.
“When a contract has been broken, the party who suffers by such
breach is entitled to receive, from the party who has broken the
contract, compensation for any loss or damage caused to him
thereby, which naturally arose in the usual course of things from
such breach, or which the parties knew, when they made the
contract, to be likely to result from the breach of it.
Such compensation is not to be given for any remote and
indirect loss or damage sustained by reason of the breach.”
10.   The words 'loss or damage' in the aforesaid sections would
necessarily indicate that the party who complains of breach must have really
suffered some loss or damage apart from being faced with the mere act of
breach of contract. That is because every breach of every contract need not
necessarily result in actual loss or damage. Compensation payable under
Section 73, 74 as also under Section 75 is only for loss or damage caused by
the breach and not account of the mere act of breach. If in any case the
breach has not resulted in or caused any loss or damage to a party, he cannot
claim compensation.
11.    Further, in Union of India v. Rampur Distillery and
Chemical Co. Ltd. (AIR 1973 SC 1098) the Apex Court held that a party
to a contract taking security deposit from the other party to ensure due
performance of the contract, is not entitled to forfeit the deposit on ground of
default when no loss is caused to him in consequence of such default. When
the question is one of forfeiture of security deposit in case of breach of
contract, such sum does not ipso facto go to the respondents. If the party
complaining is in a position to adduce evidence whereby the court can assess
reasonable compensation, then without proof of actual loss, damages will
not be awarded and amount mentioned by the contract will be penalty. In
such circumstances, it has been held that the security amount is liable to be
12.     As noticed earlier, the Award in this case clearly says that no
loss or damage has been caused to the respondent. That being the position,
neither the provisions of Sections 73, 74 or 75 could have been invoked nor
are they applicable in this case. That being the position, the AT was certainly
wrong in rejecting the claim of the claimant for release of the amount of
security deposit of ₹ 3 lakhs. This finding in violation of the provisions of
Sections 73 to 75 of the Contract Act, is certainly in contravention of the
fundamental policy of Indian Law as contemplated in Section 34(2)(b)(ii) of
In the result, the appeal is allowed. The impugned order dated
4.12.2017 in O.P.(Arb.) No.105/2015 is set aside. The Award to the extent it
disallows Claim No.1 for the release of security deposit of ₹ 3 lakhs towards
risk liability amount, is set aside and the said claim shall stand allowed. The
amount has been withheld without any justification and therefore the amount
of ₹ 3 lakhs will be returned by the respondent to the claimant with interest
@ 6% p.a. from the date of moving the claim before the AT till realisation
and costs.
