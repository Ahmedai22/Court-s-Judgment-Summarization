Present :    Mr. Munfaid Khan, Advocate for the petitioners.
The limited challenge to the order dated 23.09.2021 passed by
the Motor Accident Claims Tribunal, Palwal (hereinafter referred to as the
‘Tribunal’) is to the extent whereby the Tribunal has directed 50% of the
compensation awarded to be deposited in fixed deposits. The further
challenge is to the order dated 12.05.2022 dismissing the application filed by
the petitioners for release of the amount directed to be deposited in the
Learned counsel for the petitioners would contend that the
petitioners lost their son namely, Sakir, in a motor vehicle accident. The
Tribunal awarded a total amount of Rs.11,18,272/- along with interest @
7.5% per annum from the date of filing of the claim petition till its
realization.  However, it was further directed that on realization of the
awarded amount together with the interest, the same shall be shared equally
by the claimants and 50% of the amount of the share of the claimants was
directed to be paid in cash to them whereas remaining 50% was directed to
be deposited in a FDR in a nationalized bank in their names for a period of
three years.

Learned counsel for the petitioners would contend that both the
petitioners are over 40 years of age and have three other children to look
after and hence the money is urgently required by them. In support of his
contention, he relies on judgment of the Hon’ble Supreme Court in H.S.
Ahammed Hussain vs. Irfan Ahammed, [2002(3) RCR (Civil) 563] to
contend that in the case of an adult it would not be appropriate to direct the
deposit of the amount of compensation in a fixed deposit.
I have heard learned counsel for the petitioners.
In the present case, the claimant-petitioners are the parents of
the deceased who are wanting the release of the amount which has been
awarded to them but 50% of the awarded amount has been directed to be
deposited in FDRs. It is contended by the learned counsel for the petitioners
that the petitioners require the amount for taking care of their three other
minor children and in support of his contention learned counsel for the
petitioners has relied upon a judgment by the Hon’ble Supreme Court in
H.S. Ahammed Hussain’s case (supra) wherein it has been held as under :
“8. Learned counsel for the appellant lastly submitted
that the amount of compensation payable to mothers of
the victims should not have been directed to be kept in
fixed deposit in a nationalised bank. In the facts and
circumstances of the present case, we are of the view
that the amount of compensation awarded in favour of
the mothers should not be kept in fixed deposit in a
nationalised bank. In case the amounts have not been

already invested, the same shall be paid to the mothers,
but if, however, invested by depositing the same in fixed
deposit in a nationalised bank, there may be its
premature withdrawal in case the parties so intend.”
Keeping in view the law laid down in the above referred case as
well as the fact that the petitioners are over 40 years of age and have also
three other minor children to look after, the present petition is allowed. The
order dated 12.05.2022 passed by the Tribunal is set aside and the award
dated 23.09.2021 is modified to the said extent. The amount of
compensation lying deposited in the shape of FDRs be released to the
petitioners forthwith.
Disposed off in the above terms. Pending applications, if any,
also stand disposed off.
