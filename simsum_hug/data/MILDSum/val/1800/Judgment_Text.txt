1.    This public interest litigation raises a concern of seminal
importance. Aviation safety and ancillary matters have been
placed before us. The petitioner seeks to obtain orders from
the Court to activate the respondents 2, 3 and 4 to comply
with the provisions of the Aircraft (Demolition of obstructions
caused by Buildings and Trees etc.) Rules, 1994 (hereafter
“the 1994 Rules”, for short).
2.     Pursuant to the earlier orders passed by this Court,
affidavits have been filed by the respondents. The affidavit
dated 8th July 2022 filed on behalf of the respondent no.4, the
Mumbai International Airport Limited, inter alia, reveals this.
As per a survey conducted in 2010, particulars of 137
obstacles (buildings/ structures) on the approach surface of
all   the   runways    of  the   Chhatrapati   Shivaji    Maharaj
International Airport (hereafter “the airport”, for short) were
submitted to the Director General of Civil Aviation (hereafter
“DGCA”, for short) for removal. Notices were issued under rule
4 of the 1994 Rules to 110 owners of such obstacles pursuant
whereto final orders of demolition were passed in May and
June 2017 in respect of 63 such obstacles. Owners of nine (9)
such obstacles preferred appeals to the DGCA, whereas six
(6) owners complied with the final orders. It is revealed from
the affidavit that 49 obstacles are yet to be removed and the
particulars of such obstacles have been furnished by the
respondent no. 4 to the District Collector, Mumbai Suburban
District vide notification dated 3rd November, 2017. We have
been informed by Mr. Nankani, learned senior advocate
representing respondent no. 4 that Vileparle Mahila School,
figuring at number 4 of the list, has since complied with the
final order passed by the competent authority.
3.     Our previous orders required the Collector as well as the
Municipal Corporation for Greater Mumbai (hereafter “MCGM”,
for short) to file affidavits to indicate the steps that have been
taken for demolition of the obstacles in terms of rule 8 of the
1994 Rules. It is the statutory mandate that after a final order
has been passed, it is for the District Collector to take
measures for demolition of any such obstacle that impedes
take-off and landing of the aircrafts at the airport.
4.    Mr. Pabale, learned AGP appearing for the District
Collector, Mumbai Suburban has filed an affidavit dated 27th
July, 2022 of a Tehsildar (Leave Reserve) in the Office of the
Collector. It appears therefrom that meetings were convened
by the Collector with the officials of the MCGM. The affidavit
points out that in the city of Mumbai, it is the MCGM being the
planning    authority    in  terms    of  the   provisions    of   the
Maharashtra Regional and Town Planning Act, 1966, which is
authorized to carry out demolition of structures.
5.    An attempt to shift the responsibility of demolition to the
MCGM is clear from a reading of such affidavit. However, we
are not at all impressed thereby. The 1994 Rules are the
special law in this case and once rule 8 envisages that it is the
District Collector who would be responsible for demolition of
obstacles, we do not approve of the Collector’s attempt to
pass on the responsibility to the MCGM. It is indeed true that
in the matter of demolition the Collector may require the
assistance of the MCGM but it is not correct to contend that
demolition has to be carried out by the MCGM. We find from
the affidavit filed by the MCGM that it is willing to provide
such assistance as may be required by the Collector. We,
therefore, hold that it is the Collector who needs to proceed
for demolition of the obstacles in accordance with the
provisions contained in rule 8 of the 1994 Rules.
6.    Since 48 obstacles have been identified in course of the
survey undertaken in 2010, as appears from the documents
from pages 111 to 123 of the affidavit of the respondent no.
4, we direct the Collector to personally affirm an affidavit and
indicate the road map as well as plan(s)/step(s)/measure(s)
for the purpose of demolition of those 48 identified obstacles
which do not enjoy any protection of either any appellate
order of the DGCA or a judicial order of this Court. Let such an
affidavit be filed by 19th August, 2022 which shall be placed
before us for our consideration on 22nd August, 2022.
7.    Insofar as other obstacles which have been identified by
the respondent no. 4 and forms part of the affidavit at page
238 is concerned, we propose to pass orders after the
response of the Collector is placed on affidavit in terms of this
order.
8.    If there are other planning authorities, apart from the
MCGM, whose assistance would be required for the purpose of
demolition of the obstacles, we permit the Collector to seek
such assistance and if any such assistance is sought, all other
planning authorities shall provide requisite assistance to give
full effect to this order which is intended to take the
proceedings to its logical conclusion in terms of rule 8 of the
9.    Stand over to 22nd August, 2022.
