Criminal Revision Petition No.623/2020 is arising out of the
order passed by the trial Court dated 14.1.2020 rejecting the
application filed by the petitioner under Section 451 r/w Section
457 of the Code of Criminal Procedure for release of the vehicle
belonging to him, which was seized for the offence punishable
under the provisions of Section 20(b) of the Narcotic Drugs and
Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985 (‘NDPS Act’ for short).      The
learned Single Judge of this Court by the order dated 12.11.2020,
has allowed the Criminal Revision Petition and set aside the order
dated 14.1.2020 and directed the trial Court to release the seized
vehicle to the interim custody of the petitioner on obtaining
indemnity bond and two sureties and in accordance with law.
2.   Subsequently another learned Single Judge of this Court
in the case of Zubaida –vs- State of Intelligence Officer, NCB
in Criminal Petition No.4792/2020 by the order dated 24.11.2020
has taken a different view holding that in view of the amended
provisions of 52A of the NDPS Act, The Magistrate or Special Court
has no jurisdiction to consider an application under Section 451,
452 or 457 of the Code of Criminal Procedure for granting interim
custody or otherwise of the seized article to an applicant when such
seizure has been made under the provisions of the NDPS Act and it
is the duty of the DDC, which is the authority to grant interim
custody of the seized vehicle, in view of the dictum of the Hon'ble
Supreme Court in the case of Union of India -vs- Mohanlal and
another reported in (2016)3 SCC 379.
3. In view of the order passed by the learned Single Judge of
this Court in Zubaida’s case (supra), the learned HCGP filed I.A.
No. 1/2020 in Crl.RP No.623/2020 under the provisions of Section
482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure to recall the order dated
12.11.2020, on the ground that the provisions of Section 52A of the
NDPS Act and the notification issued by the Central Government in
January 2015    empower the Drug Disposal Committee (‘DDC’ for
short) to dispose off seized narcotic drugs and psychotropic
substances and conveyances under the NDPS Act.          The learned
Single Judge while rejecting the said application for recalling, has
observed that Clause (2) of pargraph-4 of the notification issued by
the Central Government runs counter to Sections 60 and 63 of the
NDPS Act and further having regard to the provisions of the NDPS
Act, the DDC has no independent power to entertain any application
for release of the seized vehicle to the interim custody nor has it
been entrusted with the jurisdiction to adjudicate the claim of the
owner for release of the vehicle either under Section 52A of the
NDPS    Act  or  under   the   notification issued by   the   Central
Government and these questions have to be decided by the Larger
4. In view of the conflicting orders by two learned Judges of
this Court, the Hon’ble Chief Justice by a special order dated
13.1.2020, has referred this matter along with connected cases to
this Bench for adjudication of the reference.
5. We have heard the learned counsel for the parties.
II. Arguments advanced by Sri Sandesh J. Chouta, learned senior
counsel for Sri Sunil, Kumar .S, learned counsel for the petitioner
in Crl.P No.9778/2021
6. Learned senior counsel for the petitioner contended that
Criminal Petition No.9778/2021 is arising out of the order dated
5.5.2021 passed by the trial Court and by the impugned order, the
trial Court relying upon the order passed by the learned Single
Judge of this Court in Zubaida’s case (supra), has rejected the
application filed under Section 451 r/w 457 of the Code of Criminal
Procedure for release of interim custody of the vehicle to the lawful
owner and the same is erroneous and contrary to the material on
record and cannot be sustained.        He would further contend that
from the date of seizure, vehicle has been in custody of the Police
and the vehicle is parked outside the Police Station, which is getting
hampered by heavy rain and sunlight causing huge damage and if
the same is continued, no purpose would be served and the
applicant will suffer loss.   He further contended that the trial Court
rejected the application mainly relying upon the order passed by
the learned Single Judge of this Court in Zubaida’s case (supra),
but the provisions of Section 52A of the NDPS Act or the notification
issued by the Central Government dated 16.1.2015, has not
restricted the Court to exercise its powers under Section 451 and
457 of the Code of Criminal Procedure to consider the application
for interim custody of the vehicle. He would further contend that
the provisions of Section 451 Code of Criminal Procedure deals with
order for custody and disposal of property pending trial in certain
cases. When any property is produced before any Criminal Court
during an inquiry or trial, the Court may make such order as it
thinks fit for the proper custody of such property pending the
conclusion of the inquiry or trial, and, if the property is subject to
speedy and natural decay, or if it is otherwise expedient so to do,
the Court may, after recording such evidence as it thinks necessary,
order it to be sold or otherwise disposed of.      Section 457 of the
Code of Criminal Procedure deals with procedure by Police upon
seizure of property. Section 52A of the NDPS Act amended w.e.f.
29.5.1989 only deals with disposal of seized narcotic drugs and
psychotropic substances.
7.   The learned senior counsel for the petitioner further
brought to the notice of the Court that by the Standing Order
No.1/89, the Central Government considered it necessary and
expedient to determine the manner in which the narcotic drugs and
psychotropic substances, as specified in    the Notification No.4/89
dated 29.5.1989, which shall, as soon as may be after their seizure,
be disposed of.    Clause I of the standing order deals with drugs
meant for disposal; Clause II deals with general procedure for
sampling, storage etc.,;   Clause III deals with receipt of drugs in
godowns and procedure; Clause IV deals with action to be taken by
Police and other empowered officers for pre-trial disposal; and
Clause V deals with constitution and function of Drug Disposal
Committee.      Clause 5.6 prescribes that the Committee shall be
empowered to order destruction of certain seized drugs.        But, it
does not deal with power of the DDC for interim custody of the
8.   The learned senior Counsel for petitioner would contend
that in exercise of the powers conferred by the provisions of Section
52A of the NDPS Act,         the Central Government issued the
notification dated 16th January 2015 specifying as to how the
narcotic drugs, psychotropic substances, controlled substances and
conveyances which shall, as soon as may be after their seizure, be
disposed of, the officers who shall dispose them and the manner of
their disposal. Clasue-2 of the notification deals with items to be
disposed of; Clause-3 relates to officers who shall initiate action for
disposal; Clause-4 deals with manner of disposal; and         Clause-5
relates to Drug Disposal Committee.          As per Clause-6 of the
notification, the functions of the DDC shall be to – (a) meet as
frequently as possible and necessary; (b) conduct a detailed review
of seized items pending disposal; (c) order disposal of seized items;
and advise the respective investigation officers or supervisory
officers on the steps to be initiated for expeditious disposal.
Clause-7 of the notification deals with procedure to be followed by
DDC with regard to disposal of seized items; Clause-8 deals with
power of DDC for disposal of seized items mentioned therein;
Clause-9 relates to mode of disposal of drugs; Clause-10 relates to
intimation to Head of Department on destruction;            Clause-11
relates preparation of certificate of destruction; Clause-12 relates to
details of sale to be entered in godown register; and Clause-13
relates to communication of details of disposal of narcotic drugs
etc., to Narcotics Control Bureau.     Annexure 1 of the notification
refers    to   Inventory    of  seized  Narcotic  drugs, psychotropic
substances, controlled substances and conveyances; Annexure 2
relates    to   application  for disposal  of  seized narcotic drugs,
psychotropic substances, controlled substances and conveyances
under Section 52A(2) of the NDPS Act, 1985; and Annexure 3
relates to certificate by the Magistrate under sub-section (3) of
Section 52A of the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act,
1985.     The notification does not empower the DDC to consider the
application for interim release of the vehicle.
9.    He further contended that very reading of Section 36C of
the NDPS Act clearly depicts that the said section is applicable to
the entire NDPS Act and not to Chapter IV alone, thereby any
provision which is not specifically covered under the NDPS Act will
then be covered under the provisions of the Code of Criminal
Procedure. He would contend that Chapter V relates to procedure
and Section 51 NDPS Act prescribes that the provisions of the Code
of Criminal Procedure shall apply, in so far as they are not
inconsistent with the provisions of the NDPS Act, to all warrants
issued and arrests, searches and seizures made under the NDPS
Act.   Section 52 of the NDPS Act deals with disposal of persons
arrested and articles seized.        He would further contend that
section 52A concerns only with the disposal and not with the
custody of articles.   It only concerns the disposal of articles after
drawing necessary inventories, photographs and list of samples that
are duly certified by the Magistrate.     This is for the purpose of
treating the inventory, photographs & samples as primary evidence
while trying the offences under the Act. Therefore, it is clear from
the reading of Section 52A that it does not cover interim custody of
any article.   Since the provisions of Section 52A or any other
provision under NDPS Act does not concern interim custody, then
as per the provisions of Section 36C of the Act, the provisions of
the Code of Criminal Procedure are made applicable and therefore
whenever any person seeks interim custody of articles, then the
same will have to be under Section 451/457 of the Code of Criminal
10.   He further contended that whenever the Legislature has
not given any power to the Government to determine the procedure
for considering applications for interim custody of the conveyances,
then the provisions of section 451/457 of the Code of Criminal
Procedure would prevail since it is not inconsistent with the
provisions of the NDPS Act and there is no provision in the NDPS
Act to restrict the power of the Magistrate and Special court to
release a vehicle to the interim custody.      He further draw the
attention of the Court as to how the word, ‘disposal’ used in Section
52A of the NDPS Act to be construed.      A reading of Section 52A
would clearly disclose that the object behind the section is for
destruction or disposal.         Destruction takes place when a
Narcotic/Psychotropic substance is destroyed by incineration (by
burning) or by way of disposal i.e, selling the same through the
tender or auction.
11. He would contend that the notification dated 16.1.2015
issued by the Central Government, in exercise of the powers under
Section 52A of the NDPS Act, does not contain any provision that
concerns interim custody of conveyances. The notification contains
in all 13 clauses. Clauses 1 to 4 are with regard to the procedure
and power of the investigating agency with regard to disposal of
articles and clauses 5 to 12 relate to procedure and power of the
DDC with regard to disposal/destruction of articles.     Clause 13 is
the need to inform the Narcotic Control Bureau the details of
articles disposed.    There are three annexures to the notification
which stipulate the inventory to be drawn, the application to be filed
before the Magistrate and the certificate of destruction.   The entire
object of the notification is to either dispose or destroy the drugs.
Clause    9(1)(2)(4)(5)(a)(c)(d)   concern   disposal,  while  clause
9(5)(b)(6)(7) concern destruction.        The only clause which has
relevance to conveyances is clause 9(5)(e), which depicts that
seized conveyances shall be sold off by way of tender or auction as
determined by the DDC.      The said clause does not concern interim
custody and it only concerns disposal which is akin to Section 452
of the Code of Criminal Procedure.    Needless to emphasize that this
sale is post trial.   Thereby, the notification dated 16.1.2015 or
section 52A of the NDPS Act does not deal with interim custody of
articles or conveyances.
12.   The learned Senior Counsel for the petitioner further
contended that in view of the provisions of Sections 36C and 52A of
the NDPS Act and the notification dated 16.1.2015 issued by the
Central Government, it is only the provisions of the Code of
Criminal Procedure, particularly Section 451 that apply when it
comes to considering the interim custody of conveyances.           The
Legislature has intentionally not used the word, ‘custody’ under
section 52A of the NDPS Act, as can be seen under Sections 451
and 457 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.        Therefore, it is not
desirable to afford an interpretation of including the word custody
(interim or final) into the word disposal as contemplated under
section 52A of the NDPS Act.       He would further contend if the
Legislature really has intention of granting power to an Officer
(DDC), then such power would have been explicitly conferred in the
section itself.    Therefore, the power or jurisdiction cannot be
conferred to an authority/officer, who is not vested with the same
by the statute.       He would further contend that the Hon’ble
Supreme Court in the case of Union of India -vs- Mohan Lal
reported in (2016)3 SCC 379, has reiterated the contents of the
notification dated 16.1.2015 and has not recognized or conferred
any    power   to   any  officer to  consider   interim   custody   of
conveyances.      Paragraphs 30 and 31 of the judgment is           in
conformity with the notification dated 16.1.2015 and the said
judgment has no application for the interim custody of the
13. He would further contend that Section 60 of the NDPS
Act deals with liability of illicit drugs, substances, plants, articles
and conveyances to confiscation; Section 61 deals with confiscation
of goods used for concealing illicit drugs or substances; Section 62
deals   with   confiscation  of   sale   proceeds   of  illicit  drugs  or
substances; and Section 63 relates to procedure in making
confiscations.      The Drug Disposal Committee came into force in
the year 1989 and admittedly, the Central Government has not
produced any document before the Court as to how many
applications were disposed of by the Drug Disposal Committee
relating to release of the vehicles throughout India till today.
Lastly,   learned   counsel    would    contend   that   Drug     Disposal
Committee has no independent power to entertain any application
for release of the seized vehicle to the interim custody nor has it
been entrusted with the jurisdiction to adjudicate the claim of the
owner for release of the vehicle either under Section 52A of the
NDPS     Act  or  under    the   notification issued   by     the  Central
Government.        Therefore, he sought to answer the reference in
favour of the petitioner holding that in the cases arising out of
NDPS      Act,   the    Magistrate/Special    Court    is   conferred
power/jurisdiction to consider the application for interim custody of
conveyances/vehicle under Section 451 r/w Section 457 of the Code
of Criminal Procedure and not the Drug Disposal Committee.
14. In support of his arguments, learned senior counsel for
the petitioner referred to the following judgments:
1. Ashok Kumar -vs- State of Bihar and others – (2001)9 SCC
718 (para 2), with regard to release of vehicle during trial, in
exercise of powers under Section 451 of the Code of Criminal
Procedure by the Magistrate.
2. Sunderbhai Ambalal Desai -vs- State of Gujarat – (2002)10
SCC 283 (paragraphs 4,5,7,10, 15,16, 17 and 19), with
regard to powers of the Magistrate under sections 451 and
457 of the Code of Criminal Procedure
3. Union of India -vs- Mohanlal and another - (2016)3 SCC 379,
(paras 1,2,4), wherein at para 4 discussed with regard to
seizure, storage, disposal/destruction etc., of drugs and the
said judgment not considered with regard to interim custody
of the vehicle.
4. Order passed by the learned Single Judge of this Court in
Zubaida -vs- State of Intelligence Officer, NCB in Criminal
Petition   No.4792/2020    dated   24.11.2020,  wherein  the
learned Single Judge of this Court has not considered the
applicability of the provisions of the Code of Criminal
Procedure, in view of the provisions of Section 36C of the
NDPS Act etc.,
5. Order passed by the learned Single Judge of this Court in
Crl.RP No.623/2020 dated 5.1.2021, rejecting the application
for recalling holding that Magistrate/special court is the
authority to release the interim custody and not DDC and the
learned Single Judge has disagreed with the view taken in
Zubaida’s case.
III. Arguments advanced by Sri P.P. Hegde, learned senior
counsel for Smt. Rajeshwari .M, learned counsel for the
petitioner in Crl.RP 824/2021
15. Sri P.P. Hegde learned senior counsel for the petitioner
while adopting the arguments of Sri Sandesh J. Chouta, learned
senior counsel, has contended that the provisions of Section 451 of
the Code of Criminal Procedure are applicable for the interim
custody/release of vehicle by the learned Magistrate/Special Court
and not the Drug Disposal Committee.        He would further contend
that in view of the provisions of sub-section (2) of Section 52A of
the NDPS Act, an application can be filed before the Magistrate and
under sub-section (3), the Magistrate shall consider the application
and pass appropriate orders in accordance with law.         Therefore,
the Magistrate/Special Court is conferred power/jurisdiction to
release the vehicle under Section 451/457 of the Code of Criminal
Procedure.    He would further contend that Section 60 of the NDPS
Act deals with liability of illicit drugs, substances, plants, articles
and conveyances to confiscation and Section 61 of the NDPS Act
deals with confiscation of goods used for concealing illicit drugs or
substances.      He further contended that Section 457 of the Code
of Criminal Procedure relates to procedure by Police upon seizure of
property and in view of the said provisions, the Magistrate only can
consider the application for interim custody.    He further contended
that the provisions of Section 52A of the NDPS Act does not deal
with interim custody of the vehicle and it only refers to disposal of
seized narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances and therefore
either under the provisions of Section 52A of the NDPS Act or the
notification dated 16.1.2015 issued by the Central Government, in
exercise of the powers under Section 52A of the NDPS Act, Drug
Disposal Committee is not empowered to release the vehicle and it
is only the Magistrate/Special Court is conferred power/jurisdiction
to consider the application for interim custody of the vehicle.
Therefore, he sought to answer the reference holding that in the
cases arising out of NDPS Act, the Magistrate/Special Court is
conferred power/jurisdiction to consider the application for interim
custody of conveyances/vehicle under Section 451 r/w Section 457
of the Code of Criminal Procedure and not the DDC.
16.   In support of his contentions, learned senior counsel
relied upon the following judgments:
i)      State of M.P. and others -vs- Madhukar Rao – (2008)14
SCC 624 (paras 16, 17, 18 and 22)
ii)   Order dated 5.1.2021 passed by the learned Single Judge
of this Court in Crl.RP No.623/2020
IV. Arguments advanced by Sri Maskoor Hashmi M.D.,
learned counsel for the petitioner in Crl.RP No.824/2021
17. Sri Maskoor Hashmi, learned counsel for petitioner while
adopting the arguments of Sri Sandesh J. Chouta, learned senior
counsel, has contended that Section 4 of the Code of Criminal
Procedure deals with trial of offences under the IPC and other laws
and sub-section (1)     prescribes that all offences under the Indian
Penal Code shall be investigated, inquired into, tried, and otherwise
dealt with according to the provisions hereinafter contained and as
per sub-section (2), all offences under any other law shall be
investigated, inquired into, tried, and otherwise dealt with according
to the same provisions, but subject to any enactment for the time
being in force regulating the manner or place or investigating,
inquiring into, trying or otherwise dealing with such offences, which
includes NDPS Act.        He would further contend that there is no
expression to release the seized vehicle to the interim custody by
excluding the provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure, in view
of the provisions of Section 36C and 51 of the NDPS Act. He would
further contend that the Hon’ble Supreme Court in the case of
Union of India -vs- Mohanlal reported in (2016)3 SCC 379 has no
occasion to consider the provisions of Section 60(3) and Section 63
of the NDPS Act, thereby the said judgment has no application to
the facts and circumstances of the present reference. Therefore, he
sought to answer the reference holding that the Magistrate/Special
Court is conferred power/jurisdiction to consider the application for
interim custody of conveyances/vehicle under Section 451 r/w
Section 457 of the Code of Criminal Procedure and not the DDC.
18. In support of his contentions, he      relied   upon     the
judgment of High Court of Chhattisgarh in the case of Tikeshwar
Singh -vs- State of Chhatisgarh reported in 2020 SCC OnLine Chh
V. Arguments advanced by Sri Mallanagouda H, learned counsel
for the petitioner in Crl.P No.3627/2021
19.   Sri Mallanagouda, learned counsel while adopting the
arguments of Sri Sandesh J. Chouta and Sri P.P. Hegde, learned
senior counsel for the petitioner in the connected matters, has
contended that the Hon’ble Supreme Court in the case of Union of
India -vs- Mohanlal reported in (2016)3 SCC 379, has issued
guidelines under paragraph 31.2 to take appropriate steps to set up
storage facilities for the exclusive storage of seized narcotic drugs,
conveyances etc., but till today the Central Government has not
issued notification in that regard. He further contended that either
the provisions of section 52A of the NDPS Act or the notification
issued   thereunder    dated   16.1.2015   does  not  provide   any
mechanism for grant of interim custody of the vehicle and same
does not prohibit to entertain the application under sections 451
and 457 of the Code of Criminal Procedure for interim custody of
the vehicle. Therefore, he sought to answer the reference holding
that the Magistrate/Special Court is conferred power/jurisdiction to
consider the application for interim custody of conveyances/vehicle
under Section 451 r/w Section 457 of the Code of Criminal
Procedure and not the DDC.
VI. Arguments advanced by learned counsel for the
petitioner/s in Crl.RP No.623/2020, Crl.P No.3571/2021 and
20. Sri Sagar G. Nahar, learned counsel for the petitioner in
Crl.RP No.623/2020;       Sri Gopal K.B., learned counsel for the
petitioner in Crl.P No.3571/2021; and Sri Umesh for Sri R.B.
Deshpande, learned counsel for the petitioner in Crl.P No.25/2021,
while adopting the arguments of Sri Sandesh J. Chouta, learned
senior counsel for the petitioner in the connected matter, has
contended that either the provisions of section 52A of the NDPS Act
or the notification issued thereunder dated 16.1.2015 does not
provide any mechanism for grant of interim custody of the vehicle
and same does not prohibit to entertain the application under
sections 451 and 457 of the Code of Criminal Procedure for interim
custody of the vehicle. Therefore, they sought to answer the
reference holding that the Magistrate/Special Court is conferred
power/jurisdiction to consider the application for interim custody of
conveyances/vehicle under Section 451 r/w Section 457 of the Code
of Criminal Procedure and not the DDC.
VII. Arguments advanced by Sri Madhukar Deshpande, learned
counsel for the respondent in Criminal Petition No.2296/2021
21. Per contra, Sri Madhukar Deshpande, learned counsel for
respondent in Criminal Petition No.2296/2021 on behalf of Narcotics
Control Bureau assisted the Court on the point of reference and
contended that section 52-A of the NDPS Act came to be inserted
by Act 2 of 1989 w.e.f. 29.5.1989. In the statement of objects and
reasons of Amendment Act 2 of 1989, it is specifically mentioned
that amendment inter alia provides for pre-trial disposal.  He would
further contend that the word, ‘conveyance’ is defined under
Section 2(viii) of the NDPS Act and it means, a conveyance of any
description whatsoever and includes any aircraft, vehicle or vessel.
22.  He would further contend that in the notification dated
16.1.2015, clause-4 relates to manner of disposal. Sub-clause (i)
of Clause-4 prescribes that where any narcotic drug, psychotropic
substance, controlled substance or conveyance has been seized and
forwarded to the officer-in-charge of the nearest Police Station or to
the Officer empowered under Section 53 of the said Act or if it is
seized by such an officer himself, he shall prepare an inventory of
such narcotic drugs, psychotropic substances, controlled substances
or conveyances as per Annexure 1 to the notification and apply to
any Magistrate under sub-section (2) of Section 52-A of the said Act
as per Annexure 2 to the notification within thirty days from the
date of receipt of chemical analysis report of seized narcotic drugs,
psychotropic substances or controlled substances.      The sub-clause
(ii) of Clause-4 of the notification depicts that after the Magistrate
allows the application under sub-section (3) of Section 52A of the
said Act, the Officer mentioned in sub-paragraph (1) shall preserve
the certified inventory, photographs and samples drawn in the
presence of the Magistrate as primary evidence for the case and
submit details of the seized items to the Chairman of the DDC for a
decision by the Committee on the disposal, and the aforesaid officer
shall send a copy of the details along with the items seized to the
officer-in-charge of the godown.
23. He further contended that in terms of Section 52A of the
NDPS Act any disposal of any seized items would have to be done
by DDC.     He further submits that though initially there was no
provision under the NDPS Act for disposal of the seized item,
Section 52A was introduced in the year 1989 by way of amendment
which was further amended in the year 2014 by including the word,
‘conveyance’, thereby making applicable the said provisions to the
conveyance seized on account of any offence committed under the
24. Learned counsel relying on the judgment of the Hon’ble
Supreme Court in the case of Union of India -vs- Mohanlal and
another [(2016)3 SCC 379] (paragraphs - 15, 20 22 27 28 29 and
30) submits that all disposal rights are vested with the DDC.    He
also relied on the judgment of Division Bench of Kerala High Court
in the case of Shajahan -vs- Inspector of Excise and others
reported in 2019 SCC OnLine Ker 3685, wherein Kerala High Court
relying on the judgment in the case of Mohanlal stated supra,
has categorically     held that in view of the said decision, the
jurisdiction of the Magistrate to consider an application under
Section 451 of Cr.PC stands denued. Therefore, no such application
could be considered by the Magistrate or by the Special Court and
jurisdiction is vested solely and exclusively with the DDC.   Thus, he
contended that in view of the amended provisions of Section 52A of
the NDPS Act and the notification dated 16.1.2015, DDC is
empowered       to  consider   the   application for  release  of  the
conveyance/vehicle       for    interim    custody    and    not   the
Magistrate/Special Court under section 451/457 of the Code of
Criminal Procedure. Thereby, he supported the judgment of the
learned Single Judge of this Court in the case of Zubaida in Crl.P
No.4792/20. Therefore, he sought to answer the reference holding
that Drug Disposal Committee constituted under the notification
dated 16th January 2015 issued by the Central Government under
Section 52-A of the NDPS Act, is conferred power/jurisdiction to
consider the application for interim custody of conveyances/vehicle
and not the Magistrate/Special Court under Section 451 r/w Section
457 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.
25.    In support of his contentions, learned counsel relied upon
the following judgments:
i)      Union of India and another -vs- Paras laminates (P)
Ltd., reported in (1990) 4 SCC 453 para 8;
ii)     Savitri  -vs-  Govind   Singh  Rawat    reported  in
(1985)4 SCC 337 para 8 ;
iii)    Directorate   of  Revenue   Intelligence  -vs-  PRK

VIII. Arguments advanced by Sri V.S. Hegde, learned SPP-II
along with Smt. K.C. Yashoda, learned HCGP in Crl.P
No.3571/2021 and connected matters
26.    Sri V.S. Hegde, learned SPP -II along with Smt. K.C.
Yashoda, learned HCGP contended that NDPS Act is a special
enactment and it prevails over the Code of Criminal Procedure,
which is a general Act. In view of the amendment of Section 52A of
the NDPS Act, all the drugs and vehicles are included.     He would
further contend that Section 2(viii) of the NDPS Act refers to
conveyance    and  it  means   a   conveyance of any     description
whatsoever and includes any aircraft, vehicle or vessel. He would
further contend that in terms of Section 52A of the NDPS Act any
disposal of any seized items would have to be done by DDC.        He
further contended that though initially there was no provision under
the NDPS Act for disposal of the seized item, Section 52A was
introduced in the year 1989 by way of amendment which was
further amended     in the year     2014 by including     the word,
‘conveyance’, thereby making applicable the said provisions to the
conveyance seized on account of any offence committed under the
27.   He would further contend that the dictum of the Hon’ble
Supreme Court in the case of Mohanlal stated supra (paras 27, 28
29 and 30) is silent about the interim order.      He would further
contend that as per the judgment in the case of Zubaida stated
supra, Magistrate/Special Court has no power to receive any
application under Sections 451, 452 or 457 of Cr.PC and release
any item seized under the NDPS Act and the said application would
have to be filed before the DDC, which shall consider the
application. But, in Crl.RP No.623/2020, the learned Single Judge of
this Court observed that the notification issued under Section 52A
of the NDPS Act cannot take away the jurisdiction of the Magistrate
or the Special Court to decide the question as to the entitlement of
the claimant for the interim custody of the vehicle. The only point
to be decided in the present reference is which of the two
judgments of the learned single Judges to be followed.
28.    He would further contend that the Hon’ble Supreme
Court   in  the   case   of Sarabjeet  Singh   Mokha    -vs-  District
Magistrate, Jabalpur and others reported in 2021 SCC OnLine SC 1019
(para 21), has held that Article 22(5) of the Constitution mandates
that (i) the authority making the order shall “as soon as may be”
communicate the grounds on which the order has been made to the
person detained; and (ii) the detaining authority shall afford to the
person     detained    “the  earliest opportunity    of   making     a
representation    against   the   order”.  Clause    5   of  Article  22
incorporates a dual requirement: first of requiring the detaining
authority to communicate the grounds of detention as soon as may
be; and second, of affording to the detenu “an earliest opportunity”
of making a representation.     The expression, “as soon as may be,
of the grounds of detention is intended to inform the detenu of the
basis on which the order of detention has been made.                 The
expression “as soon as may be’ imports a requirement of
29.   He would further contend that Annexure-2 of the
notification dated 16.1.2015 relates to application for disposal of
seized    narcotic   drugs,   psychotropic     substances,    controlled
substances and conveyances under Section 52A(2) of the NDPS Act.
He contended that in view of the amended provisions of Section
52A of the NDPS and the notification dated 16.1.2015, DDC is
empowered     to   consider   the   application  for   release   of  the
conveyance/vehicle for interim custody and not the Magistrate/
Special Court under Section 451 r/w Section 457 of the Code of
30. In support of his contentions, he relied upon the following
i)      Sarabjeet   Singh   Mokha    -vs-   District  Magistrate,
Jabalpur and others - 2021 SCC OnLine SC 1019 (para
ii)     Suresh Nanda -vs- Central Bureau of Investigation -
(2008)3 SCC 674 .. paras 9,10, 11 and 18
iii)    Chief Information Commissioner and another –vs- State
of Nanipur and Another - (2011)15 SCC 1 .. paras 40,
44, 45, 46 and 47.
IX - Point for determination in the reference
31. In view of the aforesaid rival contentions, the only point
that would arise for our consideration in the present reference is:
"Whether the learned Magistrate/Special Court is
conferred power/jurisdiction in cases arising out
of NDPS Act to consider the application for interim
custody of conveyance/vehicle under Section 451
r/w 457 of the Code of Criminal Procedure?
Whether such powers are conferred on the Drug
Disposal Committee (DDC) constituted under the
Notification dated 16th January 2015 issued by the
Central Government under Section 52A of the
32.   We have given our thoughtful consideration to the
arguments advanced by the learned Counsel for the parties and
perused the entire material on record including the reference made
by the Hon'ble Chief Justice carefully.
33.   The main contention of the learned Counsel for the
petitioners in these petitions is that in view of the provisions of
Section 36C, 51, 52, 52A, 60(3) and 63 of the NDPS Act, who is
only the learned Magistrate or the Special Court under the NDPS
Act, who has the authority to consider the application for interim
custody of conveyance/vehicle under the provisions of Sections 451
and 457 of Cr.P.C., and there is no provision in the NDPS Act
specifying to consider the application for interim custody during the
pendency, as the trial was pending disposal of the case and it is
also their contention that there is no provision under the NDPS Act
to restrict the power of the learned Magistrate or Special Court to
release the vehicle for interim custody. But it is the contention of
the respondents that in view of the provisions of Section 52A of the
NDPS Act which came to be inserted by Act No.2 of 1989 with effect
from 29.5.1989; and the statement of objects and reasons for
amendment      Act 2 of 1989 and the Notification, dated 16.1.2015
issued by the Central Government, it is only the Drug Disposal
Committee, who has to take a decision to dispose of the seized
Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic and Controlled Substances and
Conveyances as per Annexure-1 of the Notification and the learned
Magistrate or Special Court has no power to consider the application
for release of interim custody of the vehicle, which aspect has been
considered by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Union of
India -vs- Mohanlal and Another reported in (2016) 3 SCC 379.
34. The only question that arises in the present petitions is
that in view of the provisions of Section 52A of the NDPS Act and
the    Notification   dated   16.1.2015,     whether     the   learned
Magistrate/Special Court has the authority under the provisions of
Sections 451 and 457 of Cr.P.C., or Drug Disposal Committee to
release the vehicle to consider the application for interim custody of
the vehicle/conveyance. In view of the intention of amendment of
Section 52A of the NDPS Act to finally dispose of the seized items
including   conveyances,   question   of  filing representation  or
application before the Drug Disposal Committee would not arise. If
we analyse the amendment in true spirit, power given to the Drug
Disposal Committee either under the provisions of Section 52A of
the NDPS Act or issuance of Notification, dated 16th January, 2015
for disposal of items seized finally, the power of the learned
Magistrate/Special Court to consider the application for release of
the vehicle for interim custody would be subject to merits of the
case to be decided by the Drug Disposal Committee and the
amendment of Section 52A of the NDPS Act or the issuance of
notification stated supra does not take away the power of the
35. Considering the provisions of Sections 451, 452 and 475
of Cr.P.C., and Sections 36, 51, 60(3) and 63 of the NDPS Act, we
find no distinction between the vehicles seized either under the
Scheme of Cr.P.C., or NDPS Act.      Even the NDPS Act, does not
provide a provision debarring the release of interim custody of the
vehicle.   As already stated supra, the provisions of Section 451
Cr.P.C., is not in consistent with the provisions of NDPS Act
applicable to the vehicle seized under the NDPS Act as well.
Thereby the vehicle used for transporting the Narcotic Drugs and
Psychotropic Substances can also be released for interim custody
invoking the provisions of Section 451 of Cr.P.C.
36. The notification, dated 16.1.2015, issued under Section
52A of the NDPS Act, categorically provides the manner in which
the drug has to be disposed of by the officer in-charge, who shall
after preparation of the inventory of seized narcotic drugs and
psychotropic substances, controlled substances or conveyances as
per Annexure-1 and shall apply to the Magistrate under Section 52A
of the NDPS Act as per Clause (2) to the said notification, within 30
days from the date of receipt of chemical analysis report of seized
substances.    Thereby Clause-4 of the said notification provides
manner of disposal of drugs as under:
"4. Manner of disposal.-(1) Where any narcotic
drug,     psychotropic    substance,     controlled
substance or conveyance has been seized and
forwarded to the officer-in-charge of the nearest
police station or to the officer empowered under
section 53 of the said Act or if it is seized by such
an officer himself, he shall prepare an inventory
of such narcotic drugs, psychotropic substances,
controlled substances or conveyances as per
Annexure 1 to this notification and apply to any
Magistrate under sub-section (2) of section 52A of
the said Act as per Annexure 2 to this notification
within thirty days from the date of receipt of
chemical analysis report of seized narcotic drugs,
psychotropic substances or controlled substances.
(2) After the Magistrate allows the application
under sub-section (3) of section 52A of the said
Act, the officer mentioned in sub-paragraph (1)
shall      preserve    the   certified      inventory,
photographs and samples drawn in the presence
of the Magistrate as primary evidence for the case
and submit details of the seized items to the
Chairman of the Drugs Disposal Committee for a
decision by the Committee on the disposal, and
the aforesaid officer shall send a copy of the
details along with the items seized to the officer-
in-charge of the godown.
37. Initially, the Central Government by Standing Order No.1
of 1989 dated 13.6.1989 in exercise of powers conferred under the
provisions of Section 52A of the NDPS Act specified disposal of
drugs having regard to their hazardous nature, vulnerability to
theft, substitution and constraints of proper storage space. In the
very notification, apart from declaring Drugs means for Disposal, it
has also prescribed General Procedure for Sampling, Storage,
Receipt of Drugs in Godowns and Procedure thereof, Actions to be
taken by Police and other Empowered Officers for Pre-trial disposal,
Constitution and Functions of Drug Disposal Committee, etc.
Subsequently,     the  Central  Government    superseding   the said
notification issued another notification dated 10.5.2007 under the
provisions of Section 52A of the NDPS Act partly modifying the
earlier notification stating that 'except as respects things done or
omitted to be done before such super session the Central
Government, having regard to the hazardous nature of narcotic
drugs or psychotropic substances, their the vulnerability to theft,
substitution, and constraints of proper storage space hereby,
specified the narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances which can,
as soon as may be after their seizure, be disposed of, the officers,
who can so dispose them of and the manner in which they can be
disposed of.  Clause-4, 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4 of the said Notification
"4. Manner of disposal.-(1) Where any narcotic
drug, or psychotropic substances has been seized
and forwarded to the officer-in-charge of the
nearest police station or to the officer empowered
under section 53 of the Act or if it is seized by
such an officer himself, he shall prepare an
inventory of such narcotic drugs, psychotropic
substances, as per Annexure 1 to this notification
and apply to any Magistrate under sub-section (2)
of section 52A of the said Act as per Annexure 2
to this notification.
(2) After the Magistrate allows the application
under sub-section (3) of section 52A the officer
mentioned in clause (1) above shall preserve the
certified  inventory,  photographs    and  samples
drawn in the presence of the Magistrate as
primary evidence for the case and submit details
of the Drug consignments to the Chairman of the
Drug Disposal Committee for a decision by the
Committee on the disposal. The officer shall send
a copy of the details along with the Drug
consignments    to  the   officer-in-charge  of  the
4.1. Drug Disposal Committee.- The Head of the
Department of each Central and State drug law
enforcement agency shall constitute one or more
Drug   Disposal    Committees     comprising   three
Members each. Each        such committee shall be
headed by an officer not below the rank of
Superintendent of Police, Joint Commissioner of
Customs and Central Excise, Joint Director of
Directorate of Revenue Intelligence or officers of
equal lent rank. The Committee shall be directly
responsible to the Head of the Department.
4.1.1. Functions.- The functions of the Drug
Disposal Committee will be to-
(a) meet as frequently as possible and necessary;
(b) conduct a detailed review of Drug pending
(c) order disposal of Drug; and
(d) advise the respective investigation officers
/supervisory officers on the steps to be initiated
for expeditious disposal.
4.1.2. Procedure to be followed by the Committee
with regard to the disposal of Drugs.- (1) The
officer-in-charge of godown shall prepare a list of
all Drug consignments that have been certified
under section 52A of the Act to having become
ripe for disposal and submit it to the Chairman of
the concerned Drug Disposal Committee. After
examining the list and satisfying that the drugs
mentioned therein or fit for disposal and are no
longer required for legal proceedings and that the
approval of the Court has been obtained for the
purpose the members of the respective Drug
Disposal    Committee    shall  endorse    necessary
certificates to this effect. The Committee shall
thereafter   physically examine    and    verify the
weight and other details of each of the Drug
consignments     with   reference  to   the   seizure
report, report of chemical analysis and any other
documents, and record its findings in each case.
4.1.3. Power of Committee for disposal of seized
Drugs- The Committee can order disposal of Drug
consignments     up   to   the  quantity   or   value
indicated in the Table 1 below-
Table1: Quantities and values up to which Drug
Disposal Committees can order disposal of drug
Provided that if the consignments are larger in
quantity or higher value than those indicated in
the Table. 1, the Drug Disposal Committee shall
send its recommendations to the Head of the
Department who can order their disposal by a
high level Drug Disposal Committee specially
constituted for this purpose.
(i) Opium, morphine, codeine and the baine shall
be disposed of by transferring to the Government
Opium     and   Alkaloid  Works     under     the   Chief
Controller of Factories.
(ii) In case of drugs other than the drugs
mentioned in Clause (i),      the Chief Controller of
Factories shall be intimated by the fastest means
of communication available, the details of the
drug consignments that are ready for disposal.
(iii) The Chief Controller of Factories shall indicate
within fifteen days of the date of receipt of the
communication,     the quantities of drugs, if any,
that are required by him to supply as samples
under rule 67B.
(iv) Such quantities of drugs if any, as required by
the Chief Controller of Factories under Clause (iii)
shall be transferred to him and the remaining
quantities of drugs shall be destroyed as per the
procedure outlines in para 4.1.2.
(v)    Destruction   shall  be   by   incineration  in
incinerators fitted with appropriate air pollution
control devices, which comply with emission
standards. Such incineration may only be done in
places where adequate facilities and security
arrangements exist. In order to ensure that such
incineration may not be a health hazard or
polluting, consent of the State Pollution Control
Board or Pollution Control Committee, as the case
may be, should be obtained. Destruction shall be
carried out at the presence of the Members of the
destruction.-     The    Disposal     Committee     shall
intimate the Head of the Department regarding
the programme of destruction at least fifteen days
in advance so that, in case he deems fit, he may
either himself conduct surprise checks or depute
an officer for conducting such surprise checks.
After    every   destruction     operation,   the   Drug
Disposal Committee shall submit to the Head of
the    Department      a   report    giving  details   of
4.4 Certificate of destruction.- A certificate of
destruction    (in   triplicate)   containing   all  the
relevant data like godown entry number, gross
and net weight of the items seized, etc., shall be
prepared     and   signed    by    the   Chairman    and
Members of the Drug Disposal Committee as per
format at Annexure 3. The original copy shall be
pasted in the godown register after making
necessary entries to this effect, the duplicate to
be retained in the seizure case file and the
triplicate copy shall be kept by the Drug Disposal
Committee. Details of disposal of drugs shall be
reported to the Narcotics Control Bureau in the
The said provision also makes it clear that no direct authority is
given to the Magistrate and the duty of the Drug Disposal
Committee is only to dispose of any Narcotic Drugs, Psychotropic
Substances and Conveyances seized, but there is no specific
reference available for disposal of conveyance (vehicle) except to
include the word 'conveyance'. That perhaps be the reason why the
Special Court has refused to release the vehicle in the present
petitions which is impugned before the learned Single Judges.
38. On careful reading of the notification dated 16.1.2015, it
would appear that the Drug Disposal Committee has no other power
except to act in the mode as prescribed for disposal in Clause-
9(5)(e) which reads as under:
"(e) seized conveyances shall be sold off by way of
tender or auction as determined by the Drug
which means, such disposal only be possible after the confiscation
proceeding is complete and without confiscation, the disposal of the
seized conveyance within the scheme of the NDPS Act, 1985 cannot
be visualized and as such, the ancillary question that emerges is
that whether the said notification, has provided a mechanism for
disposal without confiscation in view of the provisions of Section 60
(1), (2) and (3) of the NDPS Act. The provision of Section 60(3) of
the said Act was introduced by the Legislature in order to ensure
protection of interest of an innocent owner before confiscating his
vehicle.    The procedure of confiscation has been made under
Section 60(3) of the said Act which provides that in the trial of
offences under the NDPS Act, whether the accused is convicted or
acquitted or discharged, the Special Court shall decide whether any
article or thing seized under this act is liable for confiscation under
Sections 60, 61 or 62 of the NDPS Act and if it decides that the
seized articles or things are liable to be confiscated, it may order
confiscation accordingly. The procedure for confiscation has been
further elaborated under sub-Section (2) of Section 63 of the NDPS
Act. A substantive reading of Section 63 read with Section 60(3) of
the NDPS Act would provide that, until the trial is over, the
confiscation proceeding cannot be initiated.    A conjoint reading of
provisos of Sub-sections (1), (2) and (3) of Section 63 would
certainly allow a prudent person to infer that immediate disposal
would mean the disposal after expiry of one month and that would
apply    to articles  or  things other    than  the   narcotic drugs,
psychotropic substance, controlled substances, the opium poppy,
coca plant or cannabis plant which are liable to speedy and natural
decay. If the Court is of the opinion that, sale would be beneficial
for its owner it may any time direct it to be sold. In that event, the
Drug Disposal Committee shall make all arrangements for sale of
those things or articles.
39.    Though the learned Counsel for the respondents
contended that the issue under reference is no more res integra in
view of the dictum of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of
Union of India -vs- Mohanlal and Another reported in (2016)3 SCC
379 decided on 28th        January, 2016,    on going through the
judgment, it clearly indicates that the Hon'ble Supreme Court has
nodoubt approved the procedure as contemplated in the Notification
dated 16.1.2015, but had no occasion either to deal with the
provisions of Sections 36, 51, 60(3) and 63 of the NDPS Act or to
consider the application for release of the interim custody of the
vehicle seized.    Though it was held that no sooner the seizure of
any narcotic drugs and psychotropic and controlled substances and
conveyances is effected, the same shall be forwarded to the officer
in-charge of the nearest police station or to the officer empowered
under Section 53 of the Act. The officer concerned shall then
approach the Magistrate with an application under Section 52-A(2)
of the Act, which shall be allowed by the Magistrate as soon as may
be required under sub-section (3) of Section 52-A, for seizure and
sampling. However, under the provisions of Section 52-A or
Notification dated 16.1.2015, the Legislature has not given any
power to the Drug Disposal Committee to decide the claim of a
person, who claims conveyances (vehicle) seized under the NDPS
Act for illegal transportation of any Narcotic drugs and psychotropic
and controlled substances as has been given by the Legislature to
the Special Court under Sections 60 and 63 of the NDPS Act where
a person claims for release of interim custody of the vehicle seized
under the provisions of NDPS Act, no provision is provided in the
notification to decide the claim. Thereby the provisions of Sections
60 and 63 of the NDPS Act would prevail only on the provisions of
the notification issued by the Central Government under Section
52-A of the NDPS Act. The provisions of Sections 60 and 63 of the
said Act envisages that seized conveyance cannot be disposed of
without deciding the claim of the person, who claims that
conveyance and the power to decide the claim of such person is
only given by the Legislature to the Special Court.        Under the
provisions of Sections 52 and 52-A of       the NDPS Act, the word
'confiscation' is not used because the trial is yet to come and it is
discretion of the trial Court to confiscate or not to confiscate the
conveyance seized under the NDPS Act as per the legal provisions.
Thereby the Drug Disposal Committee cannot dispose of the vehicle
seized unless the claim of the person is decided by the concerned
Magistrate or Special Court and disposal of the conveyance in terms
of Clause-9(5)(e) of the notification as already stated supra by the
Committee     is  only  possible  after  confiscation  proceeding  is
completed and thereby, the contention raised by the learned
Counsel for the respondents with regard to dictum of the Hon'ble
Supreme Court in the case of Mohan Lal has no application to the
facts and circumstances of the present petitions.
40. On careful perusal of the provisions of the NDPS act and
the notification dated 16.1.2015, there is no provision restricting
the power of the Magistrate or the Special Court to release the
vehicle for interim custody during the pendency of the trial. For the
sake of arguments assuming that, if that was the intention of the
Legislature while enacting the provisions of Section 52A of the
NDPS Act with effect from 29.5.1989, either the Act or the
Notification ought to have provided an Appellant Authority to the
persons, who are aggrieved by any orders passed by the Drug
Disposal Committee or for rejection of the application or allowing of
the application for release of the vehicle. Thereby, it is clear that it
is only the Court of Magistrate or Special Court, who is authorised
to consider the application for release of interim custody of the
vehicle (conveyance) and not the Drug Disposal Committee. If that
is the case of the respondents, even though the first notification
issued on 13.6.1989 introducing the provision of Section 52A of the
NDPS Act, specified the drugs for disposal having regard to
hazardous     nature,   vulnerability   to  threat substitution     and
constraints, etc., even after the lapse of 26 years of issuance of
first notification  and   7  years    of the last notification    dated
16.1.2015, introducing conveyance by amendment Act No.16 of
2014 with effect from 1.12.2014 even after eight years, the
respondents have not produced any material before this Court as to
how many applications for release of interim custody of the vehicles
have been considered and disposed of by the Drug Disposal
Committee throughout India. Only after the order is passed by the
Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Mohanlal on 28th January,
2016 and after the decision taken by the learned Single Judges of
this Court in the case of Zubaida, the learned Judges of the Special
Courts have started rejecting the application for release of interim
custody of the vehicle under the provisions of Sections 451 and 457
of Cr.P.C. All along, almost all the Courts in India were considering
the applications for interim custody under the provisions of Section
451 of Cr.P.C., for release of the vehicles except the learned Single
Judge of this Court in the case of Zubaida and the Division Bench of
Kerala High Court in the case of Shajahan reported in 2019 SCC
Online Ker. 3685 and in the case of Smart Logistics -vs- State of
Kerala reported in 2020 SCC Online Ker. 3760 by the learned
Single Judge holding that the Drug Disposal Committee is the
authority to consider such application for interim custody of the
seized vehicle relying upon the dictum of the Hon'ble Supreme
Court in the case of Mohanlal.
41.    In order to determine the reference referred to this
Court, it is relevant to consider the provision of Section 51 of the
NDPS Act, which reads as under:
"51. Provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure,
1973 to apply to warrants, arrests, searches and
seizures:- The provisions of the Code of Criminal
Procedure, 1973 (2 of 1974) shall apply, in so far
as they are not inconsistent with the provisions of
this Act, to all warrants issued and arrests,
searches and seizures made under this Act."
42.     On careful perusal of the said provision it clearly
indicates that seizures of any article or things, the provisions of the
Code of Criminal Procedure shall apply , if they are not inconsistent
with the provisions of the NDPS Act. As already stated supra, on
thorough perusal of the various provisions of the NDPS Act, we find
there is no specific provisions debarring the release of the vehicle
seized under the Act for interim custody. When the provisions of
Section 451 of Cr.P.C., is found not inconsistent with any specific
provisions of the NDPS Act, the same will have to be applied as
mandated under Section 51 of the said Act.
43.  The Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Sunderbhai
Ambalal Desai -vs- State of Gujarath reported in (2002) 10 SCC
283 where a vehicle used for committing rape and murder was
being released in exercise of powers under Section 451 Cr.P.C.,
holding that it is of no use to keep such seized vehicles at the police
stations for a long period.       It is for the Magistrate to pass
appropriate orders immediately by taking appropriate bond and
guarantee as well as security for return of the said vehicles, if
required at any point of time, which can be done pending hearing of
applications for return of such vehicles and at paragraphs-19 and
20, it has been held as under:
"19. For articles such as seized liquor also,
prompt action should be taken in disposing of it
after preparing necessary panchnama. If sample
is required to be taken, sample may be kept
properly after sending it to the Chemical Analyser,
if required. But in no case, large quantity of liquor
should be stored at the police station. No purpose
is served by such storing.
20. Similarly for the narcotic drugs also, for its
identification, procedure under Section 451 CrPC
should be followed of recording evidence and
disposal. Its identity could be on the basis of
evidence recorded by the Magistrate. Samples
also should be sent immediately to the Chemical
Analyser so that subsequently, a contention may
not be raised that the article which was seized
was not the same."
44.  The provisions of Section 36(c) of the NDPS Act was
inserted by Act No.2 of 1989 with effect from 29.5.1989 which
"Section 36A.   Offences triable by Special Courts.
[36A. Offences triable by Special Courts.-- (1)
Notwithstanding anything contained in the Code
of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (2 of 1974),
(c) the Special Court may exercise, in relation to
the person forwarded to it under clause (b), the
same      power    which     a    Magistrate    having
jurisdiction to try a case may exercise under
section 167 of the Code of Criminal Procedure,
1973 (2 of 1974), in relation to an accused person
in such case who has been forwarded to him
under that section;
On the same under the same Act, provisions of Section 52A of the
NDPS Act came to be inserted.
45.  On careful perusal of the said provision makes it clear
that the provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure shall apply to
the proceedings before the Special Court, who shall be deemed to
be a Court of Sessions and the person conducting a prosecution
before a Special Court, shall be deemed to be a Public Prosecutor.
'Save as otherwise provided in this Act'.
46.  Further the provisions of Sections 60(3) and 63 of the
NDPS Act are relevant to determine the issue involved in the
present petitions which read as follows:
" 60(3) "Liability of illicit drugs, substance, plants,
articles and conveyance to confiscation:
psychotropic substance (or controlled substance)
or   any     article    liable    to  confiscation  under
sub-section (1) or sub section (2) shall be liable
to confiscation unless the owner of the animal or
conveyance of the owner himself, his agent, if
any, and the person in charge of the animal or
conveyance and that each of them had taken all
reasonable precautions against such use.
63. Procedure in making confiscations.—
(1) In the trial of offences under this Act, whether
the    accused       is    convicted     or  acquitted  or
discharged, the court shall decide whether any
article or thing seized under this Act is liable to
confiscation under section 60 or section 61 or
section 62 and, if it decides that the article is so
liable, it may order confiscation accordingly.
(2) Where any article or thing seized under this
Act appears to be liable to confiscation under
section 60 or section 61 or section 62, but the
person who committed the offence in connection
therewith is not known or cannot be found, the
court may inquire into and decide such liability,
and may order confiscation accordingly: Provided
that no order of confiscation of an article or thing
shall be made until the expiry of one month from
the date of seizure, or without hearing any person
who    may    claim  any  right  thereto   and   the
evidence, if any, which he produces in respect of
his claim: Provided further that if any such article
or thing, other than a narcotic drug, psychotropic
substance, 1[controlled substance,] the opium
poppy, coca plant or cannabis plant is liable to
speedy and natural decay, or if the court is of
opinion that its sale would be for the benefit of its
owner, it may at any time direct it to be sold; and
the provisions of this sub-section shall, as nearly
as may be practicable, apply to the net proceeds
of the sale."
On careful reading of the said Sections, it makes it clear that a
conveyance (vehicle) seized under the NDPS Act shall be liable to
confiscation only when the owner of the conveyance, who was given
an opportunity by the Court could not prove that the conveyance
was used without his knowledge or connivance. The Court will have
to decide whether a vehicle seized under the NDPS Act is liable to
confiscation only on conclusion of the trial. The trial Court or the
Special Court has to take an independent decision on the question
of confiscation irrespective of the conviction or acquittal of
discharge recorded by it. But, at any rate, the trial Court/Special
Court is not supposed to pass any order of confiscation before the
expiry of one month from the date of seizure or without affording
an opportunity to the claimant. Thereby the Special Court has to
take a decision as to whether a vehicle is liable to confiscation only
on conclusion of the trial.    A vehicle seized under the NDPS Act
cannot be kept idle to the disadvantage of everyone concerned, till
the order of confiscation is passed on conclusion of trial.
47.   In the peculiar facts and circumstances of the present
case, we are of the considered opinion, that we have no hesitation
in holding that there is no provision under the NDPS Act debarring
release of the vehicle for interim custody.        The provisions of
Section 451 of Cr.P.C., as already stated supra, is found not
inconsistent with the provisions of the NDPS Act and is applicable to
the vehicle seized under the NDPS Act as well.      Thereby, the law
laid down by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Sunderbhai Ambalal
Desai's case stated supra will apply to the vehicles seized under the
NDPS Act as well.     Any contrary view taken by the Courts of law
would be against the interest of the owner of the vehicles, the
public at large and the State.
48.    By virtue of Section 36-C of the NDPS Act, "Save as
otherwise provided in this Act", the provisions of the Cr.P.C. have
been made applicable to the Special Court constituted under the
provisions of the NDPS Act by Amendment Act No.2 of 1989 with
effect from 29.5.1989. "Save as otherwise provided in the Act",
employed in Section 36-C of the NDPS Act, is indicative of/reflection
of the word "exception" intended to exclude some provisions of the
Cr.P.C. like Section 360 Cr.P.C. etc., which have been expressively
excluded by the NDPS Act by Sections 32A and 33 of the NDPS Act.
As such, the above stated phrase has qualified the operation of the
Cr.P.C. in the proceedings before the Special Court to the extent
provided in the NDPS Act. Once the Code of Criminal Procedure has
been made applicable, the provisions of the Cr.P.C. contained in
Sections 451 and 457 of the Cr.P.C. would automatically be
attracted. As such, with effect from 29.5.1989, the Cr.P.C. as a
whole, subject to the exception craved out as noticed herein-above,
has been made applicable to the proceeding before the Special
Court (NDPS) and therefore, application under Sections 451 and
457 of the Cr.P.C. for interim custody of the vehicle seized in
commission of offence punishable under the NDPS Act would be
maintainable and the Special Judge (NDPS) is empowered to
consider the application under Section 451/457 of the Cr.P.C. on
49. At this stage, it is relevant to consider the dictum of the
Hon'ble Supreme Court with regard to Principles of Statutory
Interpretation by Justice G.P. Singh, in the case of Rajasthan State
Road Transport Corporation -vs- Mohar Singh reported in (2008) 5
SCC 542 wherein at paragraph-21, it is held as under:
"21. We may in this behalf profitably notice the
following excerpts from Principles of Statutory
Interpretation (11th Edn.) by Justice G.P. Singh:
“‘It is a principle by no means to be whittled
down’    and   has   been    referred  to   as  a
‘fundamental rule’. As a necessary corollary of
this rule provisions excluding jurisdiction of civil
courts and provisions conferring jurisdiction on
authorities and tribunals other than civil courts
are    strictly   construed.   The    existence   of
jurisdiction in civil courts to decide questions of
civil nature being the general rule and exclusion
being an exception, the burden of proof to show
that jurisdiction is excluded in any particular
case is on the party raising such a contention.
The rule that the exclusion of jurisdiction of civil
court is not to be readily inferred is based on the
theory that civil courts are courts of general
jurisdiction and the people have a right, unless
expressly or impliedly debarred to insist for free
access to the courts of general jurisdiction of the
State. Indeed, the principle is not limited to civil
courts alone, but applies to all courts of general
jurisdiction including criminal courts. The rule as
stated above relating to strict construction of
provisions excluding jurisdiction of courts of
general     jurisdiction  was   recently   expressly
approved by the Supreme Court.”
50.  Since the provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure
including Section 451/457 have been expressly made applicable by
virtue of Sections 36-C and 51 of the NDPS Act to the proceedings
before the Special Court and there is no express bar contained in
the NDPS Act for grant of interim custody as contained in Section
52C of the Indian Forest Act, 1927, therefore, merely on the ground
that the vehicle is liable to confiscation under Section 60 of the
NDPS Act, it cannot be held that once the vehicle is seized for
commission of offence under the NDPS Act, interim custody cannot
be granted, as jurisdiction of criminal court has to be construed
strictly unless expressly excluded.
51. The very judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the
case of Union of India -vs- Mohanlal and Another stated supra
relied upon by the learned Counsel for the respondents, at
paragraphs-29 and 31 it is held as under:
"29. There are two other aspects that need to be
noted at this stage. The first is that Notification
dated 16-1-2015 does not in terms supersede
Standing Order No. 1 of 1989 insofar as the said
standing order also prescribes the procedure to be
followed  for  disposal  of   narcotic drugs   and
psychotropic   and   controlled   substances   and
conveyances. Specific overriding of the earlier
standing order would have avoided a certain
amount of confusion which is evident on account
of simultaneous presence of Standing Order No. 1
of 1989 and Notification dated 16-1-2015. For
instance in Para 1 of Standing Order No. 1 of
1989 only certain narcotic drugs and psychotropic
substances enumerated therein could be disposed
of while Notification dated 16-1-2015 provides for
disposal of all narcotic drugs and psychotropic and
controlled substances and conveyances. Again in
terms of Standing Order No. 1 of 1989 the
procedure     for    making    of  application  was
marginally different from the one stipulated in
Notification dated 16-1-2015 not only insofar as
the procedure related to the officers who could
make the application is concerned but also in
relation to the procedure that the DDC would
follow  while    directing  disposal. In   both the
Notifications are prescribed the limits up to which
the disposal could be directed. In case of excess
quantity the disposal under Standing Order No. 1
of 1989 had to be done in the presence of the
head of the department whereas according to
Notification of 2015 in the event of excess
quantity or value the disposal has to be by a high-
level Drug Disposal Committee to be constituted
by the head of the department. Again while
Standing Order No. 1 of 1989 specifically required
the approval of the Court for disposal, Notification
dated 16-1-2015 does not stipulate such approval
as a specific condition. Be that as it may, to the
extent the subsequent notification prescribes a
different   procedure,    we    treat  the   earlier
Notification/Standing Order No. 1 of 1989 to have
been superseded.
31.1. No sooner the seizure of any narcotic drugs
and psychotropic and controlled substances and
conveyances    is  effected,  the   same   shall  be
forwarded to the officer in charge of the nearest
police station or to the officer empowered under
Section 53 of the Act. The officer concerned shall
then approach the Magistrate with an application
under Section 52-A(2) of the Act, which shall be
allowed by the Magistrate as soon as may be
required under sub-section (3) of Section 52-A, as
discussed by us in the body of this judgment
under the heading “seizure and sampling”. The
sampling shall be done under the supervision of
the Magistrate as discussed in Paras 15 to 19 of
this order.
31.2. The Central Government and its agencies
and so also the State Governments shall within
six months from today take appropriate steps to
set up storage facilities for the exclusive storage
of seized narcotic drugs and psychotropic and
controlled     substances   and    conveyances    duly
equipped with vaults and double-locking system
to prevent theft, pilferage or replacement of the
seized drugs. The Central Government and the
State Governments shall also designate an officer
each for their respective storage facility and
provide for other steps, measures as stipulated in
Standing Order No. 1 of 1989 to ensure proper
security against theft, pilferage or replacement of
the seized drugs.
31.3. The Central Government and the State
Governments shall be free to set up a storage
facility   for  each  district  in   the  States  and
depending upon the extent of seizure and store
required, one storage facility for more than one
31.4. Disposal of the seized drugs currently lying
in the Police Malkhanas and other places used for
storage     shall  be  carried   out   by  the   DDCs
concerned in terms of the directions issued by us
in the body of this judgment under the heading
“disposal of drugs”."
The Hon'ble Supreme Court in its finding has held that both the
notifications of the year 1989 and 2007 prescribe limits up to which
could be directed.    In case of excess quantity, the disposal under
Standing Order No.1 of 1989 had to be done in the presence of the
Head of the Department, whereas according to Notification of 2015,
in the event of excess quantity or value the disposal has to be by a
High Level Drug Disposal Committee to be constituted by the Head
of the Department.       Again while Standing Order No.1 of 1989
specifically required the approval of the Court for disposal.
Notification, dated 16.1.2015 does not stipulate such approval as a
specific condition. Be that as it may, to the extent the subsequent
notification prescribes a different procedure, and accordingly, the
Hon'ble Supreme Court held that the earlier Notification/Standing
Order No.1 of 1989 have to be superseded. In order to avoid any
confusion arising out of the continued presence of two notifications
on the same subject it was made clear that disposal of narcotic
drugs and psychotropic and controlled substances and conveyances
shall be carried out in the manner prescribed, till such time the
Government    prescribed   a  different procedure    for  the same.
Admittedly, in the present case, the respondents have not produced
any procedure prescribed by the Central Government as directed by
52. Further the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the said Mohanlal's
case held that in cases in which the proceedings are still pending
before the Courts at the level of Trial Court, Appellate Court or
before the Supreme Court. In such cases, the Heads of the
Department concerned shall ensure that appropriate applications
are moved by the officers competent to do so under Notification
dated 16-1-2015 before the Drug Disposal Committees concerned
and steps for disposal of such narcotic drugs and psychotropic and
controlled substances and conveyances taken without any further
loss of time.   Accordingly, directed that no sooner the seizure of
any narcotic drugs and psychotropic and controlled substances and
conveyances is effected, the same shall be forwarded to the officer
in charge of the nearest police station or to the officer empowered
under Section 53 of the Act. The officer concerned shall then
approach the Magistrate with an application under Section 52-A(2)
of the Act, which shall be allowed by the Magistrate as soon as may
be required under sub-section (3) of Section 52-A of the NDPS Act.
53. On analyzing the provisions of NDPS Act, particularly the
amended provisions of Section 52-A of the NDPS Act and the
Notification dated 16.1.2015, it makes it clear that earlier in the
Act, there was no provision regarding the pre-trial disposal of the
seized narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances. The storage of
seized narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances up to the final
conclusion of the trial of the cases created many problems and
thereby, Section 52-A of the NDPS Act, 1985 empowered the
Central Government to prescribe by a notification the procedure to
be followed for seizure, storage and disposal of the drugs and
psychotropic   substances.     So   to counter   the  problems   like
vulnerability to theft, substitution, constraints of proper storage
space and other relevant problems, the Central Government in
exercise of that power has issued the said notification, which
prescribes the procedure of pre-trial disposal and destruction of
seized narcotic drugs, psychotropic substances and conveyance.
But the Legislature has not given any power to Drug Disposal
Committee to decide the claim of a person, who claims conveyance
(vehicle seized) under the NDPS Act for illegal transportation of any
Narcotic drugs and psychotropic and controlled substances as has
been given by the Legislature to the Special Court under Sections
60 and 63 of the NDPS Act, where a person claims for release of
interim custody of the vehicle seized under the provisions of NDPS
Act, no provision is provided in the notification to decide the interim
claim. Thereby the provisions of Sections 60 and 63 of the NDPS
Act would prevail only on the provisions of the notification issued by
the Central Government under Section 52-A of the NDPS Act. The
provisions of Sections 60 and 63 of the said Act envisages that
seized conveyance cannot be disposed of without deciding the claim
of the person, who claims that conveyance and the power to decide
the claim of such person is only given by the Legislature to a
Magistrate or Special Court. Under the provisions of Sections 52
and 52A of the NDPS Act, the word 'confiscation' is not used
because the trial is yet to come and it is discretion of the trial Court
to confiscate or not to confiscate the conveyance seized under the
NDPS Act as per the legal provisions.
54.  It is also relevant to consider the provisions of Section
4(2) of the Code of Criminal Procedure which is as under:
"4. Trial of offences under the Indian Penal Code
(2) All offences under any other law shall be
investigated, inquired into, tried, and otherwise
dealt with according to the same provisions, but
subject to any enactment for the time being in
force   regulating   the   manner    or   place  of
investigating, inquiring into, trying or otherwise
dealing with such offences."
55. In view of the above, there is no expression to release
the interim custody of the vehicle or exclude the provisions of the
Code of Civil Procedure in view of the Section 36-C of the NDPS Act.
It is also relevant to consider, at this stage, that either in the
Notification dated 16.1.2015 or the amended provisions of Section
52-A of the NDPS Act, no mechanism is provided for consideration
of application for grant of interim custody of the vehicle.
56.   The entire object of the Notification is to either dispose
or destroy the drugs. Clause 9(1), (2), (4), (5)(a)(c)(d) of the
Notification concerns with Disposal, while Clause 9(5)(b), (6), (7)
concerns with Destruction. The only clause which has relevance to
conveyances     is  Clause    9(5)(e)   which   depicts   that   seized
conveyances shall be sold off by way of tender or auction as
determined by the Drug Disposal Committee. The said Clause does
not concern to interim custody and it only concerns with Disposal
which is akin to Section 452 of the Cr.P.C.    Needless to emphasize
that this sale is post-trial.       Thereby the Notification, dated
16.01.2015 or the Provisions of Section 52A of the NDPS Act does
not deal with the interim custody of the seized Articles or
Conveyances.      The Legislature has intentionally not used the word
"Custody" under Section 52A of the NDPS Act, as can be seen under
Sections   451 and     457 of    the  Code of Criminal       Procedure.
Therefore, the power or jurisdiction cannot be conferred to
authority/officer including the Drug Disposal Committee, who is not
vested with the same by the Statute.           The power under the
Notification issued cannot go beyond the statutory provisions of
Section 52A of the NDPS Act.
57.   The Full Bench of the High Court of Calcutta in the case
of Teru Majhi -vs- State of West Bengal reported in Laws (Cal)
2014-439 while considering the Provisions of Section 36 of the
NDPS Act of the provisions of Section 438 of Cr.P.C. at paragraphs
8, 9 , 82, 83, 87, 95 to 97 held as under:-
8. The question of law set out in the reference,
Is a Special Court under Section 36 of
9. Brother Debangshu Basak, J. in his Judgment
opined that a Special Court constituted under
Section 36 of the NDPS Act, 1985 is competent to
entertain a pre-arrest Bail Petition under Section
438, Cr.P.C. I fully subscribe to such view and
concur with his conclusion. At the same time, in
the light of our unanimous opinion, in our answer
to the reference, it is also required to be clarified
that such jurisdiction of the designated Judge to
exercise   power     under    Section   438,  Cr.P.C.
relating to offences punishable under the NDPS
Act is exclusive and was never vested with the
82. Section 36-C of the NDPS Act, 1985 provided
that the provisions of the Code of Criminal
Procedure, 1973 including the provisions as to
bails and bonds would apply to the proceedings
before a Special Court save otherwise provided in
the NDPS Act, 1985. For the purpose of the
provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure,
1973, which were made applicable under Section
36-C, the Special Court was deemed to be a Court
of   Session    and    the   person    conducting    a
prosecution before a Special Court was deemed to
be a Public Prosecutor.
interpretation were viewed from various angles by
the appearing parties. The views of the Petitioners
and the Amicus Curiae were the same on the
interpretation    of    Section   36-C    and    such
interpretation varied from the one propounded on
behalf of the State by the Public Prosecutor.
87. Much revolved around the interpretation of
Section 36-C of the NDPS Act, 1985. Sri Jeyaram
Educational Trust (supra) required us to find out
whether the words used in Section 36-C of the
NDPS Act, 1985 were clear and unambiguous or
not. Section 36-C of the NDPS Act, 1985 was as
“36-C. Application of Code to proceedings
before a Special Court.— Save as otherwise
provided in this Act, the provisions of the
Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (2 of
1974) (including the provisions as to bail
and bonds) shall apply to the proceedings
before a Special Court and for the purposes
of the said provisions, the Special Court
shall be deemed to be a Court of Session
and the person conducting a prosecution
before a Special Court, shall be deemed to
be a Public Prosecutor. For the purpose of
argument let us keep aside the words “Save
as otherwise provided in this Act." used in
Section 36-C for a moment. The moment
those words were absent from Section 36-
C, it allowed the entirety of the Code of
These provisions of the Code of Criminal
Procedure, 1973 obviously entailed within
its fold Section 438. In absence of the
words “Save as otherwise provided in this
Act”    a   Special   Court  then   had    the
understanding, after deleting the words
“Save as otherwise provided in this Act”
from Section 36-C it read as follows:
“36-C. Application of Code to proceedings
before a Special Court.— the provisions of
the Code of Criminal procedure, 1973 (2 of
1974) (including the provisions as to bail
and bonds) shall apply to the proceedings
before a Special Court and for the purposes
of the said provisions, the Special Court
shall be deemed to be a Court of Session
and the person conducting a prosecution
before a Special Court, shall be deemed to
be a Public Prosecutor. If Section 36-C was
aforesaid, there was no debate that powers
under Section 438 of the Code of Criminal
Procedure, 1973 was available to a Special
Court. We were not permitted to either
section as it stood in the statute book. The
Section opened with the words “Save as
“Save as otherwise provided in this Act..”
used in Section 36-C. On a plain reading the
words “Save as otherwise provided in this
Act..” used in Section 36-C would mean that
the NDPS Act, 1985 was required to provide
specific exclusions of the Code of Criminal
Procedure, 1973 expressly, for a provision
of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 to
be inapplicable, in a proceeding under the
NDPS Act, 1985. The provisions of the Code
of  Criminal    Procedure,  1973    were  not
of the NDPS Act, 1985 made either the
incorporated into the NDPS Act, 1985 with
modifications. “Save as otherwise provided
in this Act” was required to be read in such
perspective. Those words did not take away
the    jurisdiction    of   the   Special    Court
exercise powers of Section 438 of the Code.
95. There was unanimity at the bar as to the
availability of Section 438 of the Code of Criminal
Procedure, 1973 to an accused under the NDPS
96. The    same    logic    as   that  of Pijush   Kanti
Dey (supra) would apply in the case of the NDPS
Act,  1985.     NDPS    Act,    1985   was    a  special
consolidated and amended the law relating to the
Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances in
India. It provided for speedy trial. It provided for
the control and regulation of operations relating
to Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances.
The NDPS Act, 1985 provided for the forfeiture of
property derived from, or used in, illicit traffic in
Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances. The
NDPS Act, 1985 made provisions to be in tune
with the International Convention on Narcotic
Drugs and Psychotropic Substances that India
were party to. On consideration of the various
provisions of the NDPS Act, 1985 it could be
safely said that the NDPS Act, 1985 was a self-
contained Code. It conferred special jurisdiction
and powers to the Special Court constituted under
the NDPS Act, 1985 with regard to trial of
offences committed under such Act. The NDPS
Act, 1985 required trial of offences under such Act
punishable with imprisonment for three years and
above to be tried by Special Court constituted
under such Act. The provisions of the Code of
Criminal Procedure, 1973 save and except those
provisions which were expressly excluded were
applicable to a proceeding before the NDPS Act,
1985. The powers of Section 438 of the Code of
Criminal Procedure, 1973 to be unavailable to a
Special Court constituted under the NDPS Act,
1985 was required to be taken away expressly by
the NDPS Act, 1985 itself. Such was not the
position. Section 36-C of the NDPS Act, 1985
empowered the Special Court constituted under
the NDPS Act, 1985 to exercise powers under
Section 438 of the Code of Criminal Procedure,
1973. These provisions of the Code of Criminal
Procedure, 1973 were not taken away expressly
or otherwise by the NDPS Act, 1985.
97.   We would, therefore, answer the Reference
by stating that a Special Court constituted under
Section 36 of the NDPS Act, 1985 was competent
to entertain a pre-arrest bail Petition under
Section 438 of the Code of Criminal Procedure,
58. In the judgments relied upon by the learned Counsel for
the respondents in the case of Shajahan -vs- Inspector of Excise
and Others reported in 2019 SCC OnLine Kerala 3685 (DB)
(paragraph-3) and Union of India -vs- Mohanlal and Another
reported in (2016)3 SCC 379, there was no occasion to consider
the application for release of the interim custody of the vehicle
(conveyance) and in that view of the matter, the said judgment
relied upon by the learned Counsel for the respondents to the effect
that Drug Disposal Committee has power and not the Magistrate or
the Special Court under the NDPS Act, have no application to the
facts and circumstances of the present petitions.
59. For the reasons stated above, we answer the Reference
i)     The Magistrate or the Special Court is conferred
with   the   power/jurisdiction   to   consider  the
application    for   interim     custody    of   the
conveyance/vehicle     under    the   provisions  of
Sections 451 and 457 of the Code of Criminal
Procedure in cases arising out of the provisions of
ii)    The Drug Disposal Committee constituted under the
Notification dated 16.1.2015 issued by the Central
Government under the provisions of Section 52A of
the NDPS Act has no authority to consider the
application for release of interim custody of the
conveyance/vehicle;
60. Place the matters before the learned Single Judge having
roster to dispose of the same on merits and in accordance with law
in the light of the decision on the reference made by this Court
stated supra with prior approval from the Hon'ble Chief Justice.
