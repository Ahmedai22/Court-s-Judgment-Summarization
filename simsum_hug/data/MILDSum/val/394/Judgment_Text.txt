Claimant is in appeal against the award dated 3rd September,
2013 passed by the Motor Accident Claims Tribunal, Jalandhar (for short,
2.           Claim petition was filed under Section 166 of the Motor
Vehicles Act, 1988 claiming compensation on account of injuries suffered
by the appellant in a motor-vehicular accident dated 8th of April, 2008.
3.           It needs to be noticed that respondent No.3 i.e. Insurer already
stood deleted before the Tribunal vide order dated 2nd of September, 2011.
Thus, the issue remains between the claimant/appellant and the owner of
the alleged offending vehicle.
4.           As per the claim petition, while on 8th of April, 2008 at about
9.30 p.m. the appellant along with his friend namely Parkash Singh were
going for evening walk, respondent No.1 while driving motorcycle Make
Hero Honda Splendor bearing Regn. No.PB-08-AJ-0959 came from the
back side in a rash and negligent manner at a high speed without blowing
any horn and banged the motorcycle with the appellant. The appellant
received injuries and became unconscious. Shri Parkash Singh arranged for
conveyance and took the appellant to Civil Hospital, Nakodar. The
appellant remained under treatment in the hospital from 9th April, 2008 to
21st April, 2008 where he underwent surgery. Steel rod and plate were
inserted in left leg of the petitioner. A sum of Rs.1,50,000/- was spent on
medicines, operations, scanning, special diet, charges for Hospital,
conveyance etc. Thereafter also he remained under treatment.
5.            The claim petition was contested by the respondents. On the
basis of the pleadings of the parties, following issues were framed by the
“1.    Whether Mohinder Pal applicant on 08.04.2008 met
with an accident with motorcycle No.PB08-AJ-0959
driven rashly and negligently by respondent No.1 OPA
2.    Whether    the      applicant  is   entitled to receive
compensation on account of injuries suffered by him?
3.    Whether the claim application is not maintainable?
4.    Whether respondent No.1 has no concern with
offending motorcycle, if so, its effect? OPR
6.           The Tribunal dismissed the claim petition filed by the appellant
holding that FIR was proved on file by the appellant. Thus, the best
evidence having been withheld by the appellant it cannot be held that the
accident was caused by rash and negligence on part of the driver of the
offending vehicle. The Tribunal decided Issue No.2 also against the
appellant and disbelieved Exhibit P-1 i.e. the Disability Certificate. It has
been held that the alleged accident took place on 8th of April, 2008 and the
Disability Certificate was got prepared on 1st of April, 2009 which creates
doubt about genuineness of the same. The Tribunal decided Issue No.4 also
against the appellant holding that the petitioner has failed to bring any
evidence on record to show that respondent No.1 has any concern with the
7.           Ld. Counsel for the appellant has drawn attention of this Court
to the statement of PW4 - Parkash Singh son of Jagat Singh on whose
statement FIR No.82 dated 9th of April, 2008 was registered under Sections
279/337/ 338 of the IPC. He submits that in the cross-examination of the
said witness suggestions have been put w.r.t. the contents of the FIR No.82
dated 9th of April, 2008 which was registered qua the accident. He thus
submits that so far as the existence and the registration of the FIR is
concerned, the same stands proved on record. He claims that in these
circumstances finding recorded by the Tribunal on Issue No.1 is perverse
and the same deserves to be reversed. He further refers to the statement
suffered by RW-1 who is none else but respondent No.1 (driver of the
offending vehicle). He in his Examination-in-Chief himself refers to FIR
and claims that the same is a false one.
8.           Ld. Counsel for the appellant further refers to other evidence
on record including statement of PW-1 to show that the cumulative effect of
whole of the evidence leads to inference that the appellant suffered injuries
in the accident and the same cannot be ignored merely for the absence of
FIR even though the existence thereof is not denied. He further refers to
statement of Sandeep Singh, Medical Officer from the Office of Civil
Surgeon, Jalandhar, who has proved Disability Certificate dated 1st of April,
2009 to submit that the document having been proved on record, the same
has been wrongly discarded by the Tribunal.
9.           Per contra, Ld. Counsel for respondents No.1 and 2 submits
that the Tribunal has rightly held that in the absence of FIR having been
proved on record, the evidence was discrepant to prove factum of the
accident. She further asserts that the Disability Certificate placed on record
was got prepared after about an year from the date of accident and, thus, the
same cannot be held to be a relevant piece of evidence.
10.          I have heard Ld. Counsel for the parties and have carefully
gone through the records of the case.
11.          It is trite that in MACT cases, the test is not ‘beyond
reasonable doubt’ but is ‘preponderance of probabilities’. Equally trite is
the law that the result of criminal case has no bearing on the claim petition
seeking compensation pending before the Tribunal. This Court is guided by
law laid down by the Apex Court in the case of NK V. Bros (P) Ltd. vs. M.
Karumai Ammal, 1980 A.C.J. 435. It is also not denied that respondent
No.1 is facing criminal case on account of rash and negligent driving which
itself shall lead to prima facie inference that the accident occurred on
account of his rash and negligent act. Reference can be made to law laid
down by this Court in the case of Girdhari Lal vs. Radhey Shyam and
12.           In the considered opinion of this Court, Tribunal erred in
completely brushing aside overwhelming evidence on record which goes on
to prove the accident. Suggestions put to the claimant as well as author of
the FIR, make it clear that respondent No.1 driver of the offending vehicle
is facing trial for rash and negligent driving qua the accident in question.
The Tribunal ought not have decided Issue No.1 against the claimant
merely for the absence of FIR. Thus, finding recorded by the Tribunal on
Issue No.1 is set aside.        Similarly, finding on Issue No.2 which is
consequential to finding on Issue No.1 is also erroneous and is set aside.
13.           So far as finding on Issue No.4 is concerned, the onus was on
respondents. Moreover, in order to claim compensation, the claimant is not
required to prove ownership of the driver over the offending vehicle.
Consequently, the claim petition ought not have been dismissed by
recording that claimant has failed to bring evidence on record to show that
respondent No.1 has concern with the motor-cycle.
14.          As a sequel of the discussion held herein above, the appeal is
allowed. The award passed by the Tribunal is set aside. The matter is
remanded back to the Tribunal to decide the claim petition afresh.
15.          Keeping in view that the parties are in litigation since 2009,
Tribunal is directed to decide the claim petition preferably within six
months from the date of receipt of certified copy of this order. Parties are
directed to appear before the District Judge, Jalandhar on 16th of August,
2022. On their appearance, District Judge shall allocate the matter to the
Tribunal of competent jurisdiction.
