Counsel for Applicant :- Manuvendra Singh,Rajeev
Counsel for Opposite Party :- G.A.
Heard learned counsel for the applicant and learned A.G.A.
This petition has been filed for quashing the order dated
22.2.2022 passed by the Additional Session Judge/Special
Judge (POCSO Act), Court No. 12, District- Sultanpur in
S.T. No. 202 of 2022 in case crime no. 395 of 2021 under
Sections 363, 366, 376 I.P.C. and 5/6 of the POCSO Act,
Brief facts of the case emerges as such that F.I.R. was
lodged by the father of the victim against the applicant-
Abhay Pratap Mishra with the allegation that his daughter
was kidnapped by the applicant applicant- Abhay Pratap
Mishra and the F.I.R. was lodged on 27.12.2021 under
Sections 363, 366, 506 I.P.C. After recovery of the girl
statement of victim was recorded under Section 161 Cr.P.C.
in which she stated that she voluntarily entered into the
relationship with the applicant and both of them solemnized
marriage in Devkali Mandir. In her statement recorded
under Section 164 Cr.P.C. in which she supported the
statement recorded under Section 161 Cr.P.C. An application
was filed on 15.2.022 by the applicant to release the girl in
favour of the applicant. The trial court without knowing the
wishes of the victim sent the victim to Nari Niketan,
Being aggrieved the applicant has filed the present petition
that the trial court has passed the order without any basis
and further submitted that as per medical report the age of
the victim is 18 years. In support of his submission learned
counsel for the applicant relied upon the judgment of the
Hon'ble Apex Court passed in the case of Smt. Parvati Devi
Vs. State of U.P. reported in 1992 All Cri Cases 32 wherein
it has been held that confinement of victim in Nari Niketan
against her wishes cannot be authorized either under
Section 97 or under Section 171 Cr.P.C. and the respondents
failed to bring to the notice of the court any legal provision
where under the Magistrate has been authorized to issue
direction that a minor female shall against her wishes be
kept in Nari Niketan. Identically in the case of Mrs. Kalyani
Chaudhory Vs State of U.P. and others reported in 1978
Criminal Law Journal 103 a Division Bench of this Court
held that no person can be kept in protective home unless
she is required to be kept there either in pursuance of the
Suppression of Immoral Traffic in Women and Girls Act or
under some other law permitting her detention in such a
Home. In such cases the question of minority is irrelevant as
even a minor cannot be detained against her will or at the
will of her father in a Protective Home.
This Court has also passed the order dated23.1.2015 in the
case of Gajraj Singh Vs. State Of U.P. in the Application
under Section 482 Cr.P.C. No. 50877 of 2014 in which this
Court after relying of the aforesaid two judgments passed
"In the case in hand, the question of the
applicant being a minor is irrelevant as even a
minor cannot be kept in protective home
against her will. The applicant may hardly be
said that she is not a women or girl which
come within a preview of Suppression of
Immoral Traffic in Women and Girls Act.
Thus, it is clear cut case of illegal confinement
of minor against her wishes violating
fundamental right. Hence, the impugned order
dated 26.05.2014 passed by the Special Judge/
Kasganj is hereby quashed and it is directed
the Superintendent of Nari Niketan, Mathura
to release the victim Dolly daughter of Gajraj
Sing be set at liberty to go in according to her
On the perusal of the impugned order, it is not clear that girl
was sent to the Nari Niketan on her wishes and it is also not
clear that any application was moved by the father of victim
for taking custody. It is, therefore, directed the trial court to
call the victim from the Nari Niketan for taking her wishes
and pass an appropriate order for her custody in accordance
with law keeping the wishes of victim.
The petition is, accordingly, disposed of.
