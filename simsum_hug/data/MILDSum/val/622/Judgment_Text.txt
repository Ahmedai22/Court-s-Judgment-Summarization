This Criminal Original Petition has been filed, invoking Section 482
Cr.P.C., seeking orders to call for the records pertaining to the case in C.C.No.
243 of 2018, pending on the file of the District Munsif-cum-Judicial Magistrate
Court, Thiruppattur, Sivagangai District and quash the same.
2. The petitioners 1 to 23 are the accused in C.C.No.243 of 2018, on the
file of the District Munsif-cum-Judicial Magistrate Court, Thiruppattur. On the
basis of the complaint lodged by the Village Administrative Officer,
Illayathangudi Village, Thiruppattur Taluk, second respondent herein, a First
Information Report came to be registered in Cr.No.103 of 2017 for the offences
under Sections 143, 188, 341 and 353 I.P.C., against 9 named persons and 14
women. The first respondent, after completing the investigation, has laid a final
report under Section 173 Cr.P.C., against the petitioners 1 to 23 for the offences
under Sections 143, 188, 341 and 353 I.P.C., and the case was taken on file in
C.C.No.243 of 2018, on the file of the District Munsif-cum-Judicial Magistrate
3. The case of the prosecution is that on 29.11.2017 at about 12.00 noon,
under the head of the petitioners 1 and 2, all the petitioners were standing in
front of the TASMAC shop bearing No.728 situated in Amman Sannathi 1st
street, in Keelasevalpatti Village, Illayathangudi Group, Sivagangai District and
demanding the closure of the said shop, that the petitioners, without getting
necessary permission from the police, had assembled and tried to obstruct the
TASMAC workers to do their duty and also disturbed the public and traffic.
4. The learned Counsel for the petitioners would submit that the
petitioners had approached the officials in a peaceful manner and asked them to
close the TASMAC shop which affects the entire village, that no incident was
occurred as alleged by the prosecution, that the petitioners, who are duty bound
to protect the villagers, particularly young generation from the influence of
alcohol, had requested the authorities to shift the TASMAC shop and that
therefore, no offence is made out as against the petitioners. The learned Counsel
for the petitioners would further submit that there is a clear bar for taking
cognizance of an offence under Section 188 I.P.C., without a complaint, as
contemplated under Section 195 Cr.P.C.
5. At this juncture, it is necessary to refer the judgment of the Honourable
Supreme Court in C. Muniappan & Ors vs State Of Tamil Nadu in CRIMINAL
APPEAL NOS. 127-130 OF 2008, dated 30.08.2010 and the relevant passages
are extracted hereunder:
“20. Section 195(a)(i) Cr.PC bars the court from taking cognizance
of any offence punishable under Section 188 IPC or abetment or
attempt to commit the same, unless, there is a written complaint by
the public servant concerned for contempt of his lawful order. The
object of this provision is to provide for a particular procedure in a
case of contempt of the lawful authority of the public servant. The
court lacks competence to take cognizance in certain types of
offences enumerated therein. The legislative intent behind such a
provision has been that an individual should not face criminal
prosecution instituted upon insufficient grounds by persons
actuated by malice, ill-will or frivolity of disposition and to save the
time of the criminal courts being wasted by endless prosecutions.
This provision has been carved out as an exception to the general
rule contained under Section 190 Cr.PC that any person can set the
law in motion by making a complaint, as it prohibits the court from
taking cognizance of certain offences until and unless a complaint
has been made by some particular authority or person. Other
provisions in the Cr.PC like sections 196 and 198 do not lay down
any rule of procedure, rather, they only create a bar that unless
some requirements are complied with, the court shall not take
cognizance of an offence described in those Sections. (vide Govind
Mehta v. The State of Bihar, AIR 1971 SC 1708; Patel Laljibhai
Somabhai v. The State of Gujarat, AIR 1971 SC 1935; Surjit Singh
& Ors. v. Balbir Singh, (1996) 3 SCC 533; State of Punjab v. Raj
Singh & Anr., (1998) 2 SCC 391; K. Vengadachalam v. K.C.
Palanisamy & Ors., (2005) 7 SCC 352; and Iqbal Singh Marwah &
Anr. v. Meenakshi Marwah & Anr., AIR 2005 SC 2119).
27. Undoubtedly, the law does not permit taking cognizance of any
offence under Section 188 IPC, unless there is a complaint in
writing by the competent Public Servant. In the instant case, no
such complaint had ever been filed. In such an eventuality and
taking into account the settled legal principles in this regard, we
are of the view that it was not permissible for the trial Court to
frame a charge under Section 188 IPC.”
6. It is pertinent to note that Section 195 Cr.P.C, bars taking cognizance of
any offence punishable under Sections 172 to 188 I.P.C., except on a complaint
in writing given by the public servant concerned or some other public servant to
whom he is administratively subordinate. A learned Single Judge of this Court
in Jeevanandham and Others vs State, represented by the Inspector of Police,
reported in 2018(2) LW (Crl.,) 606, after surveying the judgments of the
Honourable Apex Court and of this Court, has held that the Police Officer cannot
register a First Information Report, for an offence under Section 188 I.P.C., and
the Judicial Magistrate cannot take cognizance of the offence, based on the final
report filed under Section 173(2) Cr.P.C.
7. As per the above settled legal position, there must be a complaint by a
public servant who is lawfully empowered under Section 195 Cr.P.C., and it is
mandatory and that therefore, the non-compliance of the same, will make the
proceedings void ab initio and as such, the charge sheet laid under Section 188
I.P.C., has to necessarily be quashed.
8. Now coming to the provision of Section 353 I.P.C., the Honourable
Apex Court in Manik Taneja and another Vs. State of Karnataka and another
reported in (2015)7 Supreme Court Cases 423, has considered the quashment of
charge sheet for the offence under Section 353 I.P.C. and the relevant passage is
extracted as follows:
“A reading of the above provision shows that the essential
ingredients of the offence under Section 353 IPC are that the person
accused of the offence should have assaulted the public servant or
used criminal force with the intention to prevent or deter the public
servant from discharging his duty as such public servant. By
perusing the materials available on record, it appears that no force
was used by the appellants to commit such an offence. There is
absolutely nothing on record to show that the appellants either
assaulted the respondents or used criminal force to prevent the
second respondent from discharging his official duty. Taking the
uncontroverted allegations, in our view, that the ingredients of the
offence under Section 353 IPC are not made out.”
9. In the case on hand, there is no allegation that the petitioners have
assaulted the TASMAC staffs or any other persons or used criminal force with an
intention to prevent or deter the TASMAC staffs from discharging their duty.
Considering the uncontroverted allegations, this Court has no other option but to
say that the ingredients of the offence under Section 353 I.P.C., are not made
10. Now turning to the offences under Sections 143 and 341 I.P.C., it is
necessary to refer the following passages in Jeevanandham's case above referred.
2.In all the cases, the assembly of persons were expressing
dissatisfaction on the governance and claiming for minimum
rights that are guaranteed to an ordinary citizen. If such an
assembly of persons are to be trifled by registering an FIR
under Section 143 of IPC and filing a Final Report for the very
same offence, no democratic dissent can ever be shown by the
citizens and such prohibition will amount to violation of
fundamental rights guaranteed under the Constitution. A reading
of the Final Report also does not make out an offence
under Section 341 of Cr.P.C since any form of an agitation, will
necessarily cause some hindrance to the movement of the general
public for sometime. That by itself, does not constitute an offence
of a wrongful restraint.
11. As rightly held by this Court in Jeevanandham's case, the violation of
Section 30(2) of the Police Act will not constitute an offence under Section 143
I.P.C., as an order passed under Section 30(2) of the Police Act is only regulatory in
nature, by which, the police cannot prohibit any agitations. The prosecution in
order to invoke Section 341 I.P.C.,          has to establish that a person voluntarily
obstructed any person so as to prevent that person from proceeding in any direction
in which a person has a right to proceed. In the case on hand, as already pointed out,
the petitioners have assembled and conducted an agitation to shift the TASMAC
shop and there is absolutely no material to show that they have voluntarily
obstructed any person. Even assuming that there existed some hindrance for the
movement of the general public for some time, as rightly held in Jeevanandham's
case, that by itself does not constitute an offence of wrongful restraint. Considering
the above, this Court has no hesitation to hold that the final report does not make
out any offence of the wrongful restraint.
12. As already pointed out, the purpose of agitation is to close the TASMAC
shop and shift the same from that place. No doubt, the prohibition is a policy matter
to be decided by the Government. But, at the same time, the policy of prohibition is
a constitutional mandate and the Government is having greater responsibility to
function in larger public interest. The Honourable Supreme Court in Re-Ramlila
Maidan Incident dated.4/5.06.2011 vs Home Secretary, Union of India And
Ors reported in (2012)5 SCC 1, has observed that the dharnas and agitations are
the basic features of the democratic system and the relevant passage is extract
“245. Freedom of speech, right to assemble and demonstrate by
holding dharnas and peaceful agitations are the basic features of
a democratic system. The people of a democratic country like ours
have a right to raise their voice against the decisions and actions
of the Government or even to express their resentment over the
actions of the Government on any subject of social or national
importance. The Government has to respect and, in fact,
encourage exercise of such rights. It is the abundant duty of the
State to aid the exercise of the right to freedom of speech
as understood in its comprehensive sense and not to throttle or
frustrate exercise of such rights by exercising its executive or
legislative powers and passing orders or taking action in that
direction in the name of reasonable restrictions. The preventive
steps should be founded on actual and prominent threat
endangering public order and tranquility, as it may disturb the
social order. This delegate power vested in the State has to be
exercised with great caution and free from arbitrariness. It must
serve the ends of the constitutional rights rather than to subvert
them.”
13. In the case on hand, even according to the prosecution, the petitioners
have not indulged in any act of violence. According to the petitioners, out of 23
accused, 14 accused are women and four accused accused are senior citizens.
Considering the above, this Court has no hesitation to hold that the impugned
proceedings in C.C.No.243 of 2018, pending on the file of the District Munsif-
cum-Judicial Magistrate Court, Thiruppattur, Sivagangai District, are liable to be
quashed.
14. In the result, this Criminal Original Petition is allowed and the
impugned proceedings in          C.C.No.243 of 2018, pending on the file of the
District, as against the petitioners are quashed. Consequently the connected
Miscellaneous Petitions are closed.
