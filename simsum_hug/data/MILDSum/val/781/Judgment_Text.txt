Counsel for Petitioner :- Gaurav Mehrotra,Akber Ahmad
Counsel for Respondent :- C.S.C.
1. Present writ petition is filed by the petitioner challenging his
punishment order dated 11.04.2022 passed by Additional Chief
Department, Lucknow (respondent no.2).
2. By the impugned order, petitioner is given a punishment of
censure entry and reversion to the post of Section Officer from
the post of Under-Secretary.
3. At the very outset, learned counsel for petitioner submits that
the inquiry was conducted by the Special Secretary, Medical
Education Services, U.P., who submitted her report on
25.08.2021. He submits that in the present case, the inquiry
officer was never provided the documents to which she had
relied upon in the inquiry. The said documents were summoned
by the inquiry officer during the conduct of the inquiry and
were also perused by her. However, neither copy of the said
documents were provided to the petitioner nor the same were
permitted to be perused by the petitioner. Learned counsel for
petitioner further submits that a bare perusal of the report shows
that the inquiry was conducted in violation of Rule-7 of the U.P.
Government Servants (Discipline and Appeal) Rules, 1999
(hereinafter referred to as 'Rules of 1999'), as no date, time and
place was fixed in the inquiry.
4. I have perused the inquiry report as well as the impugned
punishment order. A bare perusal of the same shows that the
inquiry officer has, in fact, not merely failed to follow the
procedure provided by Rule-7 of Rules of 1999 but has also
placed burden upon the delinquent employee to prove that he is
not guilty. In the first line of discussion, the inquiry officer
states, that, delinquent employee through his reply to the
charge-sheet/statements could not submit any evidence which
would prove that the delinquent employee is wrongly charged.
5. In the present case, the Additional Chief Secretary was
summoned along with the record. Today he is present in Court
along with the record and with his assistance as well as
assistance of the counsels for parties, record is perused. Learned
Standing Counsel also could not show from the record of the
case that the procedure as prescribed under Rule-7 of Rules of
1999 is followed in conducting the inquiry and any date, time
and place was fixed for evidence or evidence relied
upon/summoned was provided to the petitioner.
6. Though the matter is simple as it is to be remanded back, but,
in large number of cases filed before this Court, it is found that
the inquiry with regard to major penalty is conducted in
violation of Rule-7 of Rules of 1999. The present case is a
glaring example of the same. Inquiry officer is a Special
Secretary and the punishing authority is a Principal Secretary.
Still a glaring error is committed in conduct of the inquiry by
the inquiry officer and in failure to check the same by the
punishing authority before punishment order was issued. It is
not merely the duty of the inquiry officer to comply with the
Rule-7 but also the duty of the punishing authority, while
passing order of punishment, to ensure that the inquiry is
conducted as per the procedure prescribed.
7. Such mistakes in large numbers are occurring for quite some
time now in the State. The State Government as far back as on
22.04.2015 issued a detailed government order explaining at
length the manner in which inquiry with regard to minor
punishment or major punishment should be conducted. The
government order explains at length what is already prescribed
in Rule-7. When the inquiries were still not being conducted in
proper manner, again under order of this Court dated
13.01.2021 passed in Writ-A No.12110 of 2020; 'State of U.P. &
Others Vs. Vijay Anand Tiwari', a Government Order dated
10.02.2021 was issued by the State Government for compliance
of Rule-7. Despite two aforesaid government orders, the
inquiries are still not conducted in a proper manner. It is sad to
note that the both the aforesaid government orders are also not
being complied with by the officials. It is also noted that in
large number of cases, after remand when the inquiry is re-
conducted, the same procedural error is again made and again
the inquiry report is submitted without following the due
procedure as per Rule-7. This is also putting burden of
unnecessary litigation upon this Court. It is the duty of the
inquiry officer as well as the punishing authority to ensure
compliance of Rule-7.
8. Since these incidences are abundant in number, therefore, this
Court finds it necessary now to ensure that every inquiry
officer, who at present is conducting an inquiry or appointed to
conduct any inquiry in future, is provided proper training with
regard to the manner and procedure for conducting the inquiry.
Similarly the disciplinary authorities are also required to go
through a training with regard to the manner in which the
inquiries are to be conducted and, thereafter, punishment orders
are to be passed. It goes without saying that the power exercised
by the inquiry officers are quasi judicial in nature and for the
same a judicially trained mind is required. The State
Government is already having a Judicial Training and Research
Institute (J.T.R.I.) which trains/educates the officers of the State
Government on the legal compliances/procedures.
9. Therefore, Director, J.T.R.I., Lucknow is directed to
forthwith prepare an appropriate program for training of the
inquiry officers as well as for training of the disciplinary
authorities so that such mistakes are not repeated. The J.T.R.I
shall also issue an appropriate identifiable certificate to every
officer after he/she completes the training session. The relevant
details of the said training session/certificates shall be referred
by the officer concerned in every inquiry report submitted by
him/her or punishment order passed. All the officers who are
conducting any inquiry at present in the State shall attend the
training without any delay and such inquiry officers shall
conclude their inquiries only after their training is completed.
Similarly the punishing authority shall also go through the
required training before passing any punishment order and also
refer to their session/certificate. It is further directed that no
inquiry officer in future shall be appointed for departmental
inquiry who has not received the training from the J.T.R.I. The
State government shall bear the cost of the aforesaid training at
J.T.R.I. at its own cost.
10. Senior Registrar of this Court shall forthwith send a copy of
this order to the Chief Secretary of the State of U.P. as well as
Director, J.T.R.I., Lucknow for its compliance.
11. Since, in the present case, admittedly, there is violation of
Rule-7 as the documents relied upon by the inquiry officer were
never provided to the petitioner nor the inquiry is conducted
following the procedure prescribed under Rule-7, i.e., by
summoning the witnesses of the department, giving chance of
cross examination, providing opportunity to the delinquent
employee/petitioner to call his witnesses, therefore, impugned
order dated 11.04.2022 cannot stand and is set aside.
12. The matter is remanded back to respondent no.2 for
conducting fresh inquiry after following proper procedure as
prescribed under Rule-7.
13. With the aforesaid, the writ petition is allowed.
