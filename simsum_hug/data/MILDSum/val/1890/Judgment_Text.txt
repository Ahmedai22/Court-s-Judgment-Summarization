1.      The petitioner has filed the present petition under Sections 14(2)
and 15 of the Arbitration & Conciliation Act, 1996 (hereafter the ‘A&C
Act’), inter alia, praying that the mandate of the Sole Arbitrator – Mr.
Subhash Chandra Batra (hereafter the ‘Arbitrator’) be terminated and
an independent arbitrator be appointed in his place.
2.      The petitioner claims that the Arbitrator is ineligible to act as an
arbitrator by virtue of Section 12(5) of the A&C Act. He is related to
the parties and they have not entered into any agreement waiving their
By:Dushyant Rawal       O.M.P. (T) (COMM.) 119/2021                                 Page 1 of 18
right to waive the ineligibility, in terms of the proviso to Section 12(5)
of the A&C Act.
3.      In addition to the above, the petitioner also avers that the manner
in which the Arbitrator has conducted the proceedings, indicates his
bias. In particular, it is contended that the Arbitrator has passed orders
granting interim relief without any application to the aforesaid effect. It
is further submitted that the Arbitrator has also passed orders against
the persons, who are not signatories to the Arbitration Agreement or to
the arbitral proceedings.
4.      It is well settled that Sections 12 and 13 of the A&C Act provide
for the mechanism regarding challenge to the appointment of an
arbitrator. A party challenging the appointment of an arbitrator would
necessarily have to confine itself to that scheme. In terms of Section
13(1) of the A&C Act, the parties are required to follow the procedure,
as agreed, for challenging an arbitrator. Section 13(2) of the A&C Act
provides that failing any such procedure, the party who intends to
challenge an arbitrator is required to file a written statement setting out
the reasons for such a challenge within a period of fifteen days of
becoming aware of the constitution of the arbitral tribunal or the
circumstances as is referred to in Section 12(3) of the A&C Act. If the
arbitrator does not withdraw from the proceedings, the arbitral tribunal
is required to decide the challenge. If the challenge is not sustained, the
arbitral tribunal is required to proceed and make an award. The party
challenging an arbitrator does not have any recourse to courts prior to
the arbitral tribunal rendering the award. Section 13(5) of the A&C Act
By:Dushyant Rawal       O.M.P. (T) (COMM.) 119/2021                                 Page 2 of 18
makes it clear that in such a case, the party challenging an arbitrator can
make an application for setting aside the award, in accordance with
Section 34 of the A&C Act.
5.        In Progressive Career Academy Pvt. Ltd. v. FIIT Jee Ltd.1, a
Division Bench of this Court has held as under:
“16.      On a reading of Section 13(5), the
legislative intent becomes amply clear that
Parliament did not want to clothe the Courts with the
power to annul an Arbitral Tribunal on the ground of
bias at an intermediate stage. The Act enjoins the
immediate articulation of a challenge to the authority
of an arbitrator on the ground of bias before the
Tribunal itself, and thereafter ordains that the
adjudication of this challenge must be raised as an
objection under Section 34 of the Act. Courts have to
give full expression and efficacy to the words of the
Parliament especially where they are unambiguous
and unequivocal….”
substantially amended the A&C Act including Section 12 of the A&C
Act. The extent of disclosure, as required under Section 12(1) of the
A&C Act, was significantly expanded. Sub-section (5) of Section 12 of
the A&C Act was introduced. In conjunction with such amendments,
the Fifth, Sixth and Seventh Schedules were inserted to the A&C Act.
7.        An arbitrator approached in connection with his appointment is
required to make a disclosure in terms of the Sixth Schedule of the A&C
Act. The Fifth Schedule of the A&C Act indicates the circumstances,
By:Dushyant Rawal       O.M.P. (T) (COMM.) 119/2021                                   Page 3 of 18
which may give rise to justifiable doubts as to the independence and
impartiality of an arbitrator. It serves as a guide for an arbitrator to make
the necessary disclosure. Sub-section (5) of Section 12 of the A&C Act
provides for ineligibility of a person to be appointed as an arbitrator and
the Seventh Schedule of the A&C Act provides a non-exhaustive list of
circumstances that would render a person ineligible to be appointed as
an arbitrator.
8.        This Court had considered the scheme of the amendment to
Sections 12 and 14 of the A&C Act in HRD Corporation (Marcus Oil
and Chemical Division) v. Gail (India) Limited2 and found that Section
12(5) of the A&C Act stands on a separate footing than the scheme to
challenge an arbitrator under Section 12(3) of the A&C Act. The Court
held that a person, who is ineligible to be appointed as an arbitrator,
would ipso jure not have the mandate to perform such functions. He
would lack the inherent jurisdiction to act as an arbitrator. In such a
case, it was not necessary for the party challenging the appointment to
follow the procedure under Section 13 of the A&C Act; it was open to
seek recourse to Section 14 of the A&C Act. The said view was upheld
by the Supreme Court in HRD Corporation (Marcus Oil and Chemical
Division) v. Gail (India) Limited3.
9.        During the course of the proceedings, Mr. P. Nagesh, learned
senior counsel appearing for the petitioner, conceded that the present
petition would not be maintainable insofar as the petitioner’s
By:Dushyant Rawal       O.M.P. (T) (COMM.) 119/2021                                  Page 4 of 18
apprehension regarding the Arbitrator’s impartiality is concerned. He
confined the present petition to seek relief solely on the ground that by
virtue of Section 12(5) of the A&C Act, the Arbitrator was ineligible to
act as an arbitrator; therefore, his mandate is required to be terminated.
He contended that the Arbitrator has close family relationship with the
parties, which is one of the circumstances as listed in the Seventh
Schedule to the A&C Act.
10.     Mr. Sethi, learned senior counsel appearing for the respondent,
countered the aforesaid submissions and contended that none of the
circumstances as set out in the Seventh Schedule to the A&C Act were
attracted and therefore, the Arbitrator was not ineligible under Section
12(5) of the A&C Act. He further contended that, in any event, the
parties had entered into an agreement in writing after the disputes had
arisen and therefore, by virtue of proviso to Section 12(5) of the A&C
Act, the ground of ineligibility, if any, stood waived.
11.     At this stage, it would be relevant to briefly refer to the factual
context in which the controversy arises.
11.1 The petitioner and respondent are brothers and are, inter alia,
engaged in carrying on the family business of manufacturing and
dealing in jewellery ornaments. They carry on the business under an
incorporated entity, Manohar Lal Sarraf & Sons Jewellers Pvt. Ltd.
(hereafter the ‘Company’), and other entities. The petitioner as well as
the respondent hold 33.3% shares in the Company. The remaining
33.3% shares are held by the elder brother of the parties – Sh. Sudhir
By:Dushyant Rawal       O.M.P. (T) (COMM.) 119/2021                                Page 5 of 18
Singhal. It is stated that he is involved in the family business as well
and is a Director of the Company.
11.2 The eldest brother of the parties, Sh. Vivek Shekhar, does not
hold any shares in the Company. During the course of the proceedings,
it was contended (and not disputed by any party) that Sh. Vivek Shekhar
is neither involved in the family business nor in the disputes between
the parties.
11.3 Certain disputes have arisen between the parties in connection
with the family business. It appears that Sh. Sudhir Singhal is also
involved in the said disputes. Admittedly, he is also involved in the
family business and is an equal shareholder in the Company. The parties
had endeavored to resolve their disputes amicably but were
unsuccessful.
11.4 In the aforesaid context, the parties contemplated referring the
disputes to arbitration.
11.5 The respondent has produced certain e-mails (including the e-
mail dated 03.06.2021) sent by the petitioner to the respondent and
marked to several other persons, which indicates that the parties had
also discussed the names of persons, one of whom could be appointed
as an arbitrator to resolve the disputes between the parties.
11.6 The respondent had also produced an e-mail dated 18.06.2021
sent by the petitioner to the Arbitrator requesting him to accept the
appointment as an arbitrator.
By:Dushyant Rawal       O.M.P. (T) (COMM.) 119/2021                               Page 6 of 18
11.7 The parties entered into an agreement dated 04.10.2021 to refer
the disputes to arbitration (the Arbitration Agreement). On the same
date, that is on 04.10.2021, the Arbitrator made a declaration and
accepted his appointment as an arbitrator. The agreement dated
04.10.2021 is set out below:
An Understanding has emerged between Himanshu
110016 and Sh. Prabhat and Sh. Prabhat Shekhar S/o
Delhi regarding appointment of a Sole Arbitrator for
resolution of their business disputes on this 4th day of
Oct, 2021 and both of them have accordingly
reproduced the said understanding into writing and also
express their mutual consent for this purpose.
Whereas disputes have arisen between the aforesaid
parties in connection with the affairs of their business to
which they have not been able to settle mutually, and
Whereas the parties have agreed to refer the said
disputes for arbitration of sole arbitrator whose Award
shall be final and binding on them, and
Whereas, both the parties acknowledge the fact that the
accounts of their business have to be properly
scrutinized, and settled between them for which they
agree to appoint Sh Subhash Chandra Batra B.Sc. LL.B.
LL.M. a practising Advocate and who has also
experience of Judicial Service for more than 35 years
besides serving as a Member of Indian Legal Service
(Deptt. of Legal Affairs, Govt. of India) and is also a
member of the Indian Council of Arbitration.

Sh. Subhash Chandra Batra is equally related to both the
parties as their real niece Ms. Swati D/o Sh. Vivek
Shekhar is his daughter-in-law and we repose our
complete trust in him.
The abovementioned Parties also express their consent
to the stipulations which are being described hereunder:
A. All the disputes relating to the claims of the parties
are referred for final determination and award of the
Arbitrator and the proceedings of Arbitration shall
normally be conducted at F-114, J.S. Arcade, Sector-18,
Noida but the proceedings can also be conducted by the
Arbitrator at Gopal Das Tower, Barakhamba Road,
B. That the Arbitrator may take into his possession the
books and documents of the business of the parties.
C. That the Arbitrator shall record and keep the minutes
of the proceedings of arbitration and take notes of
evidence of such witnesses as may be produced by any
of the parties or which the Arbitrator shall deem fit to
examine and such evidence shall be taken on oath.
D. The Arbitrator shall be entitled to appoint or obtain
the services of an accountant or munim or such other
persons who may be well-versed in examining accounts
of the business of the parties to the satisfaction of

aforesaid, the Arbitrator may take such evidence and
make such enquiries, as he deems proper. He may
proceed ex parte in case any party fails to attend before
him after reasonable notice.

1996, (as amended) so far as applicable, shall apply to
this arbitration.
By:Dushyant Rawal       O.M.P. (T) (COMM.) 119/2021                                 Page 8 of 18
G. Both the parties hereto agree that they would co-
operate and lead evidence before the Arbitrator and will
refrain themselves from adopting delaying tactics.

Arbitrator in the matter of “M/S E.L. Educate Ltd. And
M/S India can Education Pvt. Ltd.
I am also a member of Indian Council of Arbitration.
I am identically related to both the parties, as admitted
to them and there does not exist any ground as contained
to the FIFTH SCHEDULE of the Arbitration Act, or the
like which could rise to justifiable doubts as to my
independence or impartiality.
I do not have any interest in relation to the subject
matter in dispute and also there does not appear any
circumstance which may affect my ability to devote
sufficient time to the arbitration and in particular my
ability to finish the entire arbitration within the statutory
period.”
11.9 The petitioner filed an application dated 25.10.2021, under
Section 16 read with Sections 12(5) and 14 of the A&C Act, before the
Arbitrator, praying that he recuses himself from the arbitral
proceedings. The petitioner, inter alia, contended that he was ignorant
about the proviso to Section 12(5) of the A&C Act when he had agreed
for referring the disputes to the Arbitrator. The Arbitrator rejected the
said application by an order dated 19.11.2021.
11.10 The Arbitrator is related to the parties as the daughter of Sh.
Vivek Shekhar, eldest brother of the parties – who is not involved in the
disputes – is married to the son of the Arbitrator.
12.     Mr. P. Nagesh contended that the Arbitrator is related to both the
parties and is rendered ineligible in terms of Entry no. 9 of the Seventh
Schedule of the A&C Act. He submitted that the proviso to Section
By:Dushyant Rawal       O.M.P. (T) (COMM.) 119/2021                                    Page 10 of 18
12(5) of the A&C Act is not attracted as the petitioner has not executed
any agreement waiving the right to object to the ineligibility of the
Arbitrator. He referred to the decision of the Supreme Court in Bharat
Broadband Network Ltd. v. United Telecoms Ltd.4 and submitted that
the proviso to Section 12(5) of the A&C Act would be applicable only
in case the parties had entered into an express agreement in writing. He
also referred to the judgment of the Supreme Court in State of Punjab
v. Davinder Pal Singh Bhullar & Ors.5 and contended that the question
of waiver would arise only where a party is fully informed of his right
and has intentionally abandoned the same. He referred to the decision
of a Coordinate Bench of this Court in JMC Projects (India) Ltd. v.
Indure Private Ltd.6 holding that an agreement to waive the
applicability of Section 12(5) of the A&C Act is required to be in
writing and must reflect the awareness as to the applicability of the said
provision.
13.       Mr. Sethi countered the aforesaid submissions. He contended that
none of the circumstances as referred to in the Seventh Schedule of the
A&C Act were attracted. He submitted that the Arbitrator was equally
related to the parties and not one of the parties. He submitted that the
Parliament had used the expression “one of the parties” in Entry no. 9
of the Seventh Schedule of the A&C Act as in such a case, the same
would lead to justifiable doubts as to the independence and impartiality
of an arbitrator. However, if an arbitrator chosen by the parties is
By:Dushyant Rawal       O.M.P. (T) (COMM.) 119/2021                                Page 11 of 18
equally related to both the parties, no objection, on account of his being
partial to any one of the parties due to his relationship, could arise.
Second, he submitted that the Arbitrator was related but was not closely
related.
14.     At the outset, it is also relevant to note that, in his application
before the Arbitrator, the petitioner had unequivocally stated that he had
not cast any aspersion on the integrity or the character of the Arbitrator.
He had sought his recusal solely on the ground that he was ineligible to
act as an arbitrator and to ensure that neither party, at a future stage,
could raise a challenge on the said ground. Paragraphs 3 and 11 of the
said application are relevant and set out below:
“3. At the outset, it is submitted that the Applicant has
highest regard for the Ld. Sole Arbitrator and by way of
the instant application is not raising any question on the
competency and integrity of the Arbitrator. It is stated
that independence and the impartiality of an Arbitrator
is of utmost importance for the sanctity of an arbitration
proceeding and any iota of doubt on the same by either
of the parties have the effect of the nullifying the whole
effort of the Arbitrator to adjudicate the dispute between
the parties.
11. At the cost of the Repetition, the Applicant is again
clarifying that by filing the instant application, the
Applicant is not casting any aspersions on the integrity
and character of the Ld. Sole Arbitrator and it is solely
on the ground of the ineligibility attracted to the Ld.
By:Dushyant Rawal       O.M.P. (T) (COMM.) 119/2021                                   Page 12 of 18
Sole Arbitrator by virtue of Section 12(5) read with
Seventh Schedule of the Arbitration Act, 1996 the
Applicant is compelled to file the present application in
order to ensure that neither of the Parties at a future
stage take a stance the arbitration proceedings were
conducted by an Arbitrator who was de jure ineligible
which will scuttle the whole arbitration proceedings
and lead to unnecessary wastage of the valuable time
and money of the parties and the Ld. Sole Arbitrator.”
15.     In the aforesaid context, the questions that fall for consideration
of this Court are (i) Whether the Arbitrator is ineligible to be appointed
as an arbitrator under Section 12(5) of the A&C Act; and, (2) If so,
whether the petitioner has waived his right to object to such ineligibility.
16.     Section 12(5) of the A&C Act is set out below:
“12.      Grounds for challenge. –
(5)       Notwithstanding any prior agreement to the
contrary, any person whose relationship, with the parties
or counsel or the subject-matter of the dispute, falls
under any of the categories specified in the Seventh
Schedule shall be ineligible to be appointed as an
Provided that parties may, subsequent to
disputes having arisen between them, waive the
applicability of this sub-section by an express agreement
in writing.”
By:Dushyant Rawal       O.M.P. (T) (COMM.) 119/2021                                  Page 13 of 18
17.        Entries nos. 1 to 9 of the Seventh Schedule of the A&C Act relate
to an arbitrator’s relations with the parties or the counsel. Entry No. 9 –
which is central to the controversy in this petition – reads as under:
Arbitrator’s relationship with the parties or counsel
9. The arbitrator has a close family relationship with
one of the parties and in the case of companies with
the persons in the management and controlling the
company.”
18.         The above quoted entry uses the expression ‘close family
relationship’. It is not sufficient that the arbitrator is related to any one
of the parties; the relationship must be a ‘family relationship’ and, that
too, a close one. Obviously, if an arbitrator has a close family
relationship with one of the parties, it is likely to raise doubt as to his
independence and impartiality.
19.        As noticed above, the Seventh Schedule of the A&C Act was
introduced by the Arbitration and Conciliation (Amendment) Act, 2015
based on the 246th Report of the Law Commission of India. The said
Report indicates that the Law Commission had drawn extensively from
the IBA Guidelines7 to suggest inclusion of the Seventh Schedule
(referred to as ‘Fifth Schedule in the said Report’).
20.        The IBA Guidelines include a Non-waivable Red List and a
Waivable Red List. Entry no. 9 of the Seventh Schedule of the A&C
7 International Bar Association Guidelines on conflict of interest in International Arbitration
By:Dushyant Rawal       O.M.P. (T) (COMM.) 119/2021                                                               Page 14 of 18
Act is similarly worded as Clause 2.3.8 of the Waivable Red List.
Neither the Seventh Schedule of the A&C Act nor the IBA Guidelines
define the expression ‘close family relationship’. However, there are
number of statutes, which define the said expression.
21.     The Vermont Securities Regulations, 2016 defines the expression
‘close family relationship’ to mean “a person within the third degree of
relationship, by blood or adoption, or a spouse, step child or a fiduciary
of a person within the third degree of relationship”.8 The Employment
Standards Act, SNB 1982 (New Brunswick, Canada) defines the
expression ‘close family relationship’ to mean the relationship
“between parents and their children, between siblings and between
grandparents and their grandchildren, and includes a relationship
between persons who, though not married to one another and whether
or not a blood relationship exists, demonstrate an intention to extend to
one another the mutual affection and support normally associated with
those relationships first mentioned.”9
22.     It is also relevant to refer to Explanation I to the Seventh
Schedule of the A&C Act, which defines the expression ‘close family
“Explanation 1.—The term “close family member” refers to a
spouse, sibling, child, parent or life partner.”
9 Employment Standards Act, SNB 1982, c E-7.2
By:Dushyant Rawal       O.M.P. (T) (COMM.) 119/2021                                   Page 15 of 18
23.     The expression ‘close family member’ is also used in Entries nos.
10, 18 and 19 of Seventh Schedule of the A&C Act. The said entries
“10. A close family member of the arbitrator has a
significant financial interest in one of the parties or an
affiliate of one of the parties.
18. A close family member of the arbitrator has a
significant financial interest in the outcome of the
dispute.
19. The arbitrator or a close family member of the
arbitrator has a close relationship with a third party who
may be liable to recourse on the part of the unsuccessful
party in the dispute.”
24.     It is seen that even in cases, where there is a likelihood of bias,
such as where a family member of an arbitrator has a significant
financial interest, the same is applicable only if the family member is a
“spouse, sibling, child, parent or life partner”. This also indicates that
by no stretch, the relationship between the Arbitrator and the parties can
be described as a close family relationship solely on the basis that the
Arbitrator’s son is married to their niece. He is, in fact, not even a close
family member of Sh. Vivek Shekhar (the eldest brother of the parties)
within the meaning of Explanation I to the Seventh Schedule of the
A&C Act. The family relationship of the parties with the Arbitrator is
through Sh. Vivek Shekhar and at best, can be described as distant.
25.     The Seventh Schedule of the A&C Act is not exhaustive; the
circumstances, as mentioned in the Seventh Schedule of the A&C Act,
By:Dushyant Rawal       O.M.P. (T) (COMM.) 119/2021                                   Page 16 of 18
are indicative. Nonetheless, the plain language of Entry no. 9 indicates
that it is not the legislative intent to render a distant relative of the
parties to be ineligible for being appointed as an arbitrator, if both the
parties so agree.
26.     In the present case, the family relationship between the Arbitrator
and the parties cannot be described as a close family relationship. The
Arbitrator’s son is married to the daughter of the eldest brother of the
parties. The Arbitrator is not from the same family as that of the parties.
27.     The contention that the parties are closely related to Sh. Vivek
Shekhar (as brothers) and he has close family relationship with the
Arbitrator, as he is the father-in-law of his daughter, is unpersuasive.
Close family relationship of A with B and B with C does not necessarily
mean that A and C have a close family relationship. This is clear if one
considers that first cousins from the maternal side and first cousins from
the paternal side can hardly be considered to have any family
relationship.
28.     In view of the above, it is unnecessary to decide the question
whether the Arbitration Agreement dated 04.10.2021, constituted a
waiver in terms of the proviso to Section 12(5) of the A&C Act.
29.     Before concluding, it is necessary to note that the learned counsel
for Sh. Sudhir Singhal, who was appearing in another appeal, had stated
that he would voluntarily join the arbitral proceedings and agree to be a
signatory to the Arbitration Agreement, if the mandate of Arbitrator is
terminated and another person is appointed in his place.
By:Dushyant Rawal       O.M.P. (T) (COMM.) 119/2021                                 Page 17 of 18
30.     As noticed above, it does appear that Mr. Singhal is also involved
in the disputes as he is involved in the family business and holds 33.3%
shares in the Company. Therefore, a complete and effective resolution
of the disputes may not be possible without him joining the arbitration
and agreeing to be bound by the award.
31.     In this view, Mr Sethi had sought time to seek instructions and
the hearing was adjourned to enable him to secure the necessary
instructions. However, after obtaining the necessary instructions, he
stated that the respondent was not willing for the disputes to be referred
to another arbitrator. The respondent insists on continuing with the
arbitration before the Arbitrator, notwithstanding that neither Sh. Sudhir
Singhal nor the Company are parties to the proceedings.
32.     The petition is unmerited and is, accordingly, dismissed.
