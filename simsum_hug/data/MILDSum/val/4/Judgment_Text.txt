2.     Briefly stated; the case of the complainant is that all the
original three accused committed the offence punishable under
Sections 8(c), 20(b) and 29 of the NDPS Act; inasmuch as;
when accused No.3 was searched; found with contraband
Charas weighing 7.79 Kg from the bag held by him. It is also
the case of complainant that all the three accused were
intercepted by the complainant near Naroda Patiya Bus Stop
when they disembarked from Bus no. RJ01PA2003 coming from
Himmatnagar. It is also the case of complainant that accused
No.3-Imtekhab Rafikbhai Rangrej was in possession of bag and
refused to provide its key and therefore lock of the bag was
forced open and the aforesaid quantum of Charas was found
therein. Apart from this; various other articles such as phone
and ID Card were found from the possession of all the three
3.     On a trial, the accused No.3-Imtekhab Rafikbhai Rangrej
and accused No.1-Shaikh Mohammed Rafik were found guilty
for the offences punishable under the NDPS Act; whereas the
respondent No.2-original accused No.2 was given benefit of
4.     In order to bring home the charge, the prosecution has
examined 07 prosecution witnesses and have proved various
documentary evidence through depositions of PW 1 to 7, more
particularly, as described in paragraph 10 of the impugned
judgment and order.
5.     We have heard learned Advocate Mr.Pandya appearing
for the applicant–original complainant and have minutely
examined the material placed before us for consideration of
application filed for special leave to appeal under Section
378(4) of Code, as also the findings recorded by the learned
6.     According      to learned   Advocate   Mr.Pandya          for      the
applicant-original complainant, the acquittal recorded qua
respondent No.2-original accused No.2 is bad in law and
against the evidence on record; inasmuch as; the learned trial
Judge has overlooked the provisions of Section 67 of NDPS Act
though the learned trial Judge found and observed that the
provisions of Sections 42 and 50 of the NDPS Act which are
mandatory provisions of the Act is complied with. It is further
urged by him that the learned trial Judge has misread the
evidence; inasmuch as; respondent No.2 who is wife of
accused No.1 was all through out with other two accused who
are convicted and she travelled with them from Jaipur to
Ahmedabad in the Luxury Bus No.RJ01PA2003 and as per tour
pass (Exhibit-26) and thus respondent No.2 being wife of
accused No.1 culpability presumption of Section 35 of NDPS
Act triggers.
6.1    It is vehemently argued by learned Advocate Mr.Pandya
that respondent No.2; being wife of accused No.1, she has
knowledge of the contents of the bag where-from the
contraband Charas was found and therefore she is said to have
culpable      intention.  In other     words, Mr.Pandya        tried         to
demonstrate and explain that possession in a case may not be
physical possession; but can be constructive having power and
control over the article and accused No.3 was holding physical
possession; subject to the power and control of respondent
No.2 and her husband. In order to substantiate the submission,
learned Advocate Mr.Pandya has drawn attention of this Court
to the fact that all the three accused travelled together from
Ahmedabad to Jammu and back as per railway charts and tour
pass placed and proved before the trial Court. Not only that;
the statement of respondent No.2 recorded under Section 67
of the NDPS Act (Exhibit-89) is also corroborative piece of
evidence if not a statement of confession and therefore the
learned trial Judge ought to have looked into such statement.
In nutshell, it is submitted by learned Advocate Mr.Pandya that
respondent No.2; being wife of accused No.1 and she travelled
from Jammu to Ahmeabad and back through railway and bus
and stayed together with other convicted accused persons,
there can be no iota of doubt that all the accused were in
conscious possession of contraband Charas and thus the
learned trial Judge ought to have raised presumption under
Section 35 of the NDPS Act and thereby to record conviction
rather than acquittal of respondent No.2.
7.     We have extensively heard learned advocate Mr. Pandya
for   the     applicant. The  testimony   of PW-2–Mr.Sajansing
Dhisaramsing, Intelligence Officer, Serving with NCB Office,
Ahmedabad whose deposition recorded           below Exhibit-32
establishes that accused No.3-Imtekhab was found with
contraband Charas contained in a bag he hold. It is found and
noticed by us that accused Nos.1 and 2 did not hold the bag
and neither anything incriminating was found from their
person. On scrutiny of evidence, the learned trial Judge found
that respondent No.2 was merely a companion of her husband–
accused No.1-Shaikh Mohammed Rafik and she was not an
accomplice in the crime. The submissions of learned Advocate
Mr.Pandya that all the three accused were travelling together
and not strangers to one other in their tour from Ahmedabad
to Jammu and back and therefore the culpability presumption
of Section 35 of NDPS Act comes into play and burden shifts
upon respondent No.2 to prove that she was not aware or had
any knowledge to the fact that the bag contains the
contraband Charas. No doubt, the moment the person had
intention or knowledge of the fact, he or she is said to have
culpable intention. In a case on hand, accused No.3-Imtekhab
was holding the bag with key. As deposed by PW 2, he did not
part with the key and therefore the Officer broke open the lock
and thus respondent No.2 being companion of her husband
and except for her presence as her husband’s companion right
from the receipt of information, her conscious possession as
understood under the law does not surface even reasonable
doubt. No any call details prior to and after the incident is
placed     on      record between    accused No.3-Imtekhab             and
8.     Thus, the learned trial Judge on appraisal of entire
evidence and so also here no doubt of a reasonable degree can
be entertained that she had real knowledge of the nature of
the substance locked in the bag and key in possession of
9.     Lastly, the submissions based on confessional statement
of respondent No.2 so as to implicate her in offence which
needs not to be taken any further in light of a decision
rendered in case of Tofan Singh VS State of Tamil Nadu, (2014
1 Crimes(SC) 42), because the confessional statement is
recorded when respondent No.2 was in custody and therefore,
it being the weak piece of evidence and in absence of any
corroborative evidence, no reliance can be placed upon such
statement and thus the learned trial Judge has rightly done so.
Under the circumstances, the learned trial Judge has rightly
acquitted the respondent No.2 for the elaborate reasons stated
in  the     impugned     judgment      and   we    also     endorse           the
view/finding of the learned trial Judge leading to the acquittal
of respondent No.2.
10.    It is a cardinal principle of criminal jurisprudence that in
an acquittal appeal if other view is possible, then also, the
appellate Court cannot substitute its own view by reversing the
acquittal into conviction, unless the findings of the trial Court
are perverse, contrary to the material on record, palpably
wrong, manifestly erroneous or demonstrably unsustainable.
(Ramesh Babulal Doshi V. State of Gujarat (1996) 9 SCC 225).
In the instant case, the learned APP has not been able to point
out to us as to how the findings recorded by the learned trial
Court are perverse, contrary to material on record, palpably
wrong, manifestly erroneous or demonstrably unsustainable.
11.    In the case of Ram Kumar v. State of Haryana, reported
in AIR 1995 SC 280, Supreme Court has held as under:
“The powers of the High Court in an appeal from order of
acquittal to reassess the evidence and reach its own
conclusions under Sections 378 and 379, Cr.P.C. are as
extensive as in any appeal against the order of conviction. But
as a rule of prudence, it is desirable that the High Court
should give proper weight and consideration to the view of
the Trial Court with regard to the credibility of the witness, the
presumption of innocence in favour of the accused, the right
of the accused to the benefit of any doubt and the slowness of
appellate Court in justifying a finding of fact arrived at by a
Judge who had the advantage of seeing the witness. It is
settled law that if the main grounds on which the lower Court
has based its order acquitting the accused are reasonable and
plausible, and the same cannot entirely and effectively be
dislodged or demolished, the High Court should not disturb
the order of acquittal."
12.     As observed by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of
Rajesh Singh & Others vs. State of Uttar Pradesh reported in
(2011) 11 SCC 444 and in the case of Bhaiyamiyan Alias Jardar
Khan and Another vs. State of Madhya Pradesh reported in
(2011) 6 SCC 394, while dealing with the judgment of acquittal,
unless reasoning by the learned trial Court is found to be
perverse, the acquittal cannot be upset. It is further observed
that High Court's interference in such appeal in somewhat
circumscribed and if the view taken by the learned trial Court
is possible on the evidence, the High Court should stay its
hands and not interfere in the matter in the belief that if it had
been the trial Court, it might have taken a different view.
13.     Considering the aforesaid facts and circumstances of the
case and law laid down by the Hon'ble Supreme Court while
considering the scope of appeal under Section 378 of the Code
of Criminal Procedure, no case is made out to interfere with the
impugned judgment and order of acquittal.
14.     In view of the above and for the reasons stated above,
present application for special leave to appeal fails and same
deserves to be dismissed and is accordingly dismissed. In view
of dismissal of the application for special leave to appeal,
captioned Criminal Appeal also deserves to be dismissed and is
accordingly dismissed.
