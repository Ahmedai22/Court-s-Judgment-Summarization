These are two appeals filed by the Union of India,
through General Manager, Central Railway, Mumbai, impugning
the decision dated 1st September, 2021 awarding compensation of
Rs.8,00,000/- in Claim Petition No.OA IIu/168/2019 (First
Appeal No.113/2022) to the respondent-Reena Kharwade along
with interest at the rate of 9% per annum from the date of the
incident i.e. 5th January, 2019 till realization for injury of having
lost her both legs and also compensation of Rs.8,00,000/- in
to the respondents along with interest at the rate of 9% per annum
as dependants of the deceased mother of Reena Kharwade.
02]         The factual background is that Reena Kharwade, the
sole respondent in First Appeal No.113/2022, who was about to
be married, being desirous of travelling from Nagpur to
Pandhurna alongwith her mother for making marriage purchases,
both holding valid railway tickets, boarded GT Express Train
going towards Chennai instead of a train going towards Hazrat
Nijamuddin, Delhi. Admittedly, the daughter and the mother
boarded a wrong train going in the opposite direction. When it
was realized that they had boarded a wrong train, and when the
train slowed down near Ajni Railway Station, which is though not
a scheduled stop for GT Express, both the mother and the
daughter while attempting to deboard the moving train, slipped
and fell down, as a result of which, the mother sustained injuries
to which she succumbed and died and the respondent-daughter
was grievously injured in both her legs resulting in double
amputation. Thereafter, the two claim petitions referred to above
were preferred before the Railway Claims Tribunal, Nagpur (the
“Tribunal”) under Section 16 of the Railways Claims Tribunal
Act, 1987 read with Section 125 of the Railways Act, 1989 (the
“Railways Act”) for compensation together with interest. Claim
Petition No.OA IIu/168/2019 was preferred by the daughter for
claiming compensation for the injury of double amputation
suffered by her and the other was a claim by the dependants
including    the   daughter     being    Claim      Petition     No.OA
03]         The Tribunal allowed the claim petitions filed by the
respondents. Aggrieved by the same, the Railways are in appeal by
filing these two appeals being First Appeal Nos.113/2022 and
04]         There is no dispute on the facts in the matter. Since
the basic facts in both the appeals are same, for the sake of
convenience, Record and Proceedings, pagination with respect to
First Appeal No.113/2022 is being referred to.
05]         Mr Lambat, learned counsel for the Railways would
submit that the only issue that arises for consideration of this
Court is, whether the act of the mother and the daughter of whom
the daughter was highly educated to first board the GT Express
Train going in the wrong direction and then to alight from the
running train and that too at a station not having a scheduled halt
would be a case firstly of not holding a valid ticket and secondly
whether such an act would be a case of self-inflicted injury or a
criminal act as per the exceptions contained in the proviso to
Section 124-A of the Railways Act. He would submit that the
scope of self-inflicted injury in the Railways Act cannot be placed
in a narrow compass, but has to have a wide connotation. He
would submit that the cross-examination of the respondent (A-79
of the Record and Proceedings in First Appeal No.113/2022)
clearly indicates that the Respondent has studied up upto Master
of Computer Application; that being so highly qualified, the
Respondent was intelligent enough to understand that the train
which they got into was not the train going towards Pandhurna,
but since they were negligent, they not only boarded the wrong
train but despite knowing that for stopping the train, there is an
arrangement in the compartment to pull the chain, if required,
and despite the speed of the train being 50 to 60 kms. per hour,
they alighted the running train at Ajni Railway Station, and then
the Respondent fell down first and thereafter the mother fell
down. Learned counsel would submit that the cross-examination
of Mr. Anil Dorlikar, working as a Trackman (A-81 of the Record
and Proceedings in First Appeal No.113/2022) would suggest that
there was no jerk to the said train, as a result of which, the mother
and the daughter fell down. He would submit that this is a case
where the respondent and her mother have invited disaster
knowing fully well the consequences of having boarded the wrong
train even after hearing the railway announcements and despite
being an educated person. He would submit that therefore, this is
a clear case of self-inflicted injury and this Court should set aside
the judgment of the Tribunal.
06]          Mr. Lambat relies upon a decision of this Court in the
case of Fakira Mangal Gautel Vs. Union of India (judgment dated
4th December, 2009 in First Appeal No.406/2002) in support of
his contentions and submits that in a similar case where the
Appellant who was the Railway employee while attempting to
board a moving train, which had no stop at Itwari Railway Station
and in that process, he fell down and lost his legs, this Court
observed that the Appellant used to habitually board this train,
but on that unfortunate day, he could not succeed in boarding the
train, this Court observed that there was no scheduled halt at
Itwari Railway Station and therefore, the Appellant-railway
employee was not a bona fide passenger and not entitled to any
compensation as the Appellant endeavoured to board the moving
07]          On the other hand, Mr. Mankar, learned counsel for
the Respondents in both the appeals would submit that due to
track maintenance, when the train was passing from Ajni Railway
Station, there was an unexpected jerk, due to which, both the
mother and the daughter fell down and grievously injured
themselves. He would submit that from the cross-examination, it
is also clear that, as they realized that they had boarded a wrong
train, they wanted to alight the train whenever the train would
stop but not particularly at Ajni Railway Station. He would
submit that both the mother and the daughter had a valid journey
ticket and as such were bona fide passengers. He would submit
that the journey ticket only mentions the point of boarding as
Nagpur and the destination as Pandhurna and the date, but does
not mention the train for which the same is valid. He would
submit that there was no intention on the part of the mother and
the daughter to self-inflict, but only because they wanted to get
off the wrong train, they alighted and fell down.
08]          He relies upon the decision of this Court in the case of
Union of India Vs. Anuradha Narendra Deshmukh, 2013(6)
Mh.L.J. 242 in support of his contention, he submits that in a
similar case, this Court has dismissed the appeal of the Railways.
09]          I have heard learned counsel for the parties and with
their able assistance, I have perused the record and proceedings in
the matter.
10]          Before proceeding further, it would be apposite to set-
forth the relevant provisions of the Railways Act as under:
(I)   Section 2(29) of the Railways Act defines “passenger”
“2. Definitions.- In this Act, unless the context
otherwise requires,-
(29) “passenger” means a person travelling with a
valid pass or ticket;”
(II)  Section 123(c) of the Railways Act defines “untoward
“123. Definitions.- In this Chapter, unless the
context otherwise requires,-
(1)(i) the commission of a terrorist act within
the meaning of sub-section (1) of section 3 of
the Terrorist and Disruptive Activities
(iii) the indulging in rioting, shoot-out or
arson, by any person in or on any train
carrying passengers, or in a waiting hall, cloak
room or reservation or booking office or on
any platform or in any other place within the
precincts of a railway station; or
(2) the accidental falling of any passenger
from a train carrying passengers”
11]          Section 124-A of the Railways Act is also usefully
quoted with respect to compensation on account of untoward
“124-A. Compensation on account of untoward
incidents.- When in the course of working a railway
an untoward incident occurs, then whether or not
there has been any wrongful act, neglect or default
on the part of the railway administration such as
would entitle a passenger who has been injured or
the dependant of a passenger who has been killed
to maintain an action and recover damages in
respect thereof, the railway administration shall,
notwithstanding anything contained in any other
law, be liable to pay compensation to such extent as
may be prescribed and to that extent only for loss
occasioned by the death of, or injury to, a passenger
as a result of such untoward incident :
Provided that no compensation shall be payable
under this section by the railway administration if the
passenger dies or suffers injury due to -
e)     any natural cause or disease or medical or
surgical treatment unless such treatment becomes
necessary due to injury caused by the said untoward
incident.
Explanation.- For the purposes of this section,
“passenger” includes-
ii) a person who has purchased a valid ticket for
travelling, by a train carrying passengers, on any date
or a valid platform ticket and becomes a victim of an
untoward incident.
12]         As mentioned above, facts are not in dispute. The first
question that arises for my consideration is whether in the facts
and circumstances of this case, the mother and the daughter can
be said to be the passengers under the provisions of the Railways
Act. Section 2(29) as quoted above, generally defines a passenger
to mean a person travelling with a valid pass or ticket. Since we
are concerned with compensation under Section 124-A of the
Railways Act, the explanation to the said Section with respect to
passenger also becomes relevant. As quoted above under the said
explanation “passenger” includes a person who has purchased a
valid ticket for travelling by a train carrying passengers on any
date and becomes the victim in an untoward incident. Nowhere
the above said two provisions which define “passenger” stipulate
that to be a passenger one has to hold a ticket only for any
particular train on which the person is to travel. The Section
merely requires a valid ticket for travelling by train carrying
passengers on any date. Both the mother and the daughter were
admittedly holding a valid ticket for travelling by train from
Nagpur to Pandhurna on 5th January, 2019. A perusal of the ticket
(A-58 of the Record and Proceedings in First Appeal
No.113/2022 and A-131 of the Record and Proceedings in First
Appeal No.114/2022) only indicates the point of boarding as
Nagpur, destination as Pandhurna, the date of travel as
05.01.2019 and the cost of Rs.130/-; it does not indicate the train
by which the person has to travel. Even assuming for a moment,
for argument sake that since the GT Express Train in which the
mother and the daughter got in was not going from Nagpur to
Pandhurna, but was going in an opposite direction from Nagpur
towards Chennai, and therefore, the tickets were not valid for the
journey, however, the two above quoted definitions of passenger
under the Railways Act do not suggest this. All that is required for
availing of the benefit under Section 124-A of the Railways Act is
that the person should have purchased a valid ticket for travelling
by train carrying passengers on any date and has become a victim
of an untoward incident. There is no dispute that the mother and
the daughter had the ticket, but what is being disputed is that they
did not have tickets to travel from Nagpur towards Chennai; but
then the fact is that they did not want to go towards Chennai but
wanted to go to Pandhurna and had mistakenly boarded the
wrong train. Section 124-A of the Railways Act, as observed by
the Apex Court in the case of Union of India ..Vrs.. Prabhakaran
Vijaya Kumar and others, 2008 (2) T.A.C. 777 (SC) is a beneficial
piece of legislation and the provisions have to be interpreted in a
liberal and purposive manner, such that the benefits of the
provisions of Section 124-A of the Railways Act are received by
the Claimants and not in a literal or restrictive manner. The
mother and the daughter in this case purchased a valid ticket.
They were in a train; they were travelling by a train carrying
passengers on the date mentioned on the ticket and they became
victims while trying to alight at Ajni Railway Station. The
ingredients of the definition in the explanation (ii) to Section 124-
A having been met, in my view, both the mother and the daughter
were passengers holding a valid ticket for travelling by train on 5 th
January, 2019 and as such both were bona fide passengers.
13]         The next question that arises for consideration is
whether they became victims of an untoward incident or not.
“Untoward incident” has been defined under Section 123(c) as
above. From a bare perusal of the said provision, it is clear that the
incident would not fall under Section 123(c)(1) of the Railways
Act. That would leave us with the provisions of Section 123(c)(2)
of the Railways Act, which defines an untoward incident to mean
the accidental fall in of any passenger from a train carrying
14]         At this stage, it would be pertinent to refer to the
decision of the Apex Court in the case of Union of India ..Vrs..
Rina Devi, AIR 2018 SC 2362, has held as under:
16.6 We are unable to uphold the above view as the
concept of ‘self inflicted injury’ would require intention
to inflict such injury and not mere negligence of any
particular degree. Doing so would amount to invoking
the principle of contributory negligence which cannot
be done in the case of liability based on ‘no fault
theory’. We may in this connection refer to judgment
of this Court in United India Insurance Co. Ltd. v.
Sunil Kumar34 laying down that plea of negligence of
the victim cannot be allowed in claim based on ‘no
fault theory’ under Section 163A of the Motor Vehicles
Act, 1988. Accordingly, we hold that death or injury in
the course of boarding or de-boarding a train will be an
‘untoward incident’ entitling a victim to the
compensation and will not fall under the proviso to
Section 124A merely on the plea of negligence of the
victim as a contributing factor.”
15]         As can be seen, the Apex Court in the case of Union
of India Vs. Rina Devi (supra), clearly held that death or injury in
the course of boarding or deboarding a train will be an untoward
incident entitling the victim to compensation and will not fall
under the proviso to Section 124-A of the Railways Act merely on
the plea of negligence of the victim. In the facts of this case also
the death of the mother and the injury to the daughter have
occurred in the course of deboarding a train and therefore, clearly
the incident is an untoward incident entitling the respondent to
compensation under Section 124-A of the Railways Act.
16]         It is also pertinent here to consider whether the facts
of this case fall within the concept of self-inflicted injury as is
claimed by the learned counsel for the Railways. As can be seen
from the proviso to Section 124-A that the said proviso excludes
payment of compensation under that Section, if a passenger dies
or suffers injury due to suicide or attempt to suicide or self-
inflicted injury or his own criminal act or any act committed in a
state of intoxication or insanity or any natural cause or disease or
medical or surgical treatment. It is settled law that to deny
compensation under these exceptions, it is the Railways that has
to prove that the case falls under these exceptions and there is no
presumption. Neither it has been alleged nor it has been proved
that this is a case of a suicide or attempt to suicide or that it was an
act committed in a state of intoxication or insanity or due to any
natural case or disease or medical or surgical treatment, even the
claim that it is a self-inflicted injury has not been proved.
17]           Learned counsel has argued that despite the daughter
being an educated person traveling with her mother and despite
having heard the Railway announcements and despite Ajni not
being a scheduled stoppage, invited disaster by jumping out of a
running train and therefore, this is a case of self-inflicted injury or
their own criminal act.
18]           In this context, once again reference to paragraph 16.6
of the decision in the case of Union of India Vs. Rina Devi (supra)
becomes relevant where the Apex Court has held that the concept
of self-inflicted injury would require intention to inflict such
injury and not a mere negligence of any particular degree. So
would a criminal act also require intention. Both the mother and
the daughter wanted to go to Pandhurna to make marriage
purchases and purchased the railway tickets for the said journey. It
is clear from the depositions on record that they heard the public
announcement of the arrival of the GT Express at Nagpur
Railway Station and boarded the GT Express Train. However,
after departure of the GT Express Train from Nagpur, they came
to know that the train was going in an opposite direction and after
enquiring from the passengers, whether or not the said train was
having a scheduled halt at Ajni Railway Station, when the train
was slowing down, they tried to alight and they fell down. The
daughter fell down first and then the mother fell down due to
which, the daughter sustained injuries in both her legs and the
mother died after being grievously injured. It is also clear from the
evidence of the Trackman that the train was going at slow speed.
When a passenger realizes that he has got into a wrong train, the
natural thought that would come to her mind is to somehow or
other get off that train and that is exactly what the daughter and
her mother did when they got off the GT Express Train going in
the wrong direction, when the train slowed down near Ajni
Railway Station. While doing so, both of them fell and the mother
died and the respondent-daughter has injured herself having both
legs amputated. The entire factual matrix nowhere suggests that
the mother and the daughter had any intention to self-inflict an
injury upon themselves or that it was their own criminal act. From
the evidence placed on record, it is clear that the respondent was
about to get married on 28th January, 2019 and the unfortunate
incident has occurred on 5th January, 2019. By no stretch of
imagination, it can be said to be a case of self-inflicted injury or
their own criminal act.
19]           Coming to the decision in the case of Fakira Mangal
Gautel Vs. Union of India (supra) relied upon by learned counsel
for the Railways, I am of the view that the said decision is clearly
distinguishable on facts. That was a case where a Railway
employee who would habitually board the said train, which had
no stop at Itwari Railway Station and on one unfortunate
occasion, fell down in that process and lost his legs. Also in that
case being an employee of the Railways, he was suitably
compensated under the Workmen’s Compensation Act. The said
Railway employee had knowing fully well of the consequences
self-inflicted upon himself the injury which caused the loss of his
legs. That clearly is not the case here. In my view, the said decision
20]          In the case of Union of India Vs. Anuradha Narendra
Deshmukh (supra), where the respondent had boarded the wrong
train and fell down from the said train, this Court went on to hold
that the Railway Administration was liable for compensation as
even though it may be a rash and negligent act, but certainly it
was not a criminal act so as to exempt the Railway Administration
from paying compensation. It was observed that if a passenger
unguided by security personnel/ticket checkers mistakenly
boarded a wrong train and on realizing his mistake due to panicky
situation accidently fell down from the train, he cannot be
deprived of the compensation under Section 124-A of the
21]          The facts in the present case are different and
distinguishable. In the facts of the case at hand, the mother and
the daughter were not guided into the train carrying passengers by
any Railway Authority/RPF Personnel or warned or prevented
from alighting/deboarding the train at Ajni Railway Station.
Naturally being anxious to get off of the wrong train, they met
with the unfortunate consequences and cannot be said to have
intentionally or deliberately inflicted injury upon themselves. It
would be preposterous to suggest that they self-inflicted injury or
committed a criminal act.
22]         This, therefore, is a case of untoward incident as
elucidated by the Apex Court in the case of Union of India Vs.
Rina Devi (supra) entitling the respondents, who were bona fide
passengers, to compensation under Section 124-A of the Railways
23]         There being neither any perversity nor any error in
the judgment of the Railway Claims Tribunal warranting any
interference, the appeals deserve to be dismissed and are hereby
dismissed. No costs.
24]         All to act on an authenticated copy of this decision.
