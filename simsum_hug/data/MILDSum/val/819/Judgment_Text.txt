3.      The benefit of Section 428 Cr.P.C. was extended to the appellant. All

4.      The brief facts, as noted by the Trial Court, are as under:-
“1. In brief the facts of the prosecution case are that on
24.05.2017, ASI Surender Pal received DD No. 115B. On receipt
of the DD, ASI Surender Pal along with Ct. Jhabar Ram reached
at the spot i.e. Purani Chowki, Mustafabad, Delhi. On reaching
there, they came to know that the injured had already been
removed to GTB Hospital. Thereafter, ASI Surender Pal along
with Ct. Jhabar Ram reached GTB Hospital and collected the
MLC No. A-4451/17 of injured Yunus S/o Sh. Yusuf wherein the
doctor had mentioned ‘physical assault and U/O’. In the
meantime, brother of injured Yusuf namely Sahil also came in the
hospital in an injured condition who was also got admitted in the
hospital by ASI Surender Pal vide MLC No. C-1908/17 and the
doctor had mentioned on his MLC as ‘physical assault fit & U/O
sharp’. Thereafter, ASI Surender Pal recorded statement of
injured Yunus wherein he stated that he is the permanent resident
of Village Daurala, PS Daurala, Meerut UP and along with his
family was residing on rent and works as sewing machine
mechanic. On 24.05.2017, he along with his brother Sahil was
going to buy some medicine and when at about 10.00 PM, they
reached at the corner of Block Gali No.7, Nehru Vihar, accused
Saleem, who resided in Gali o.6 Dayalpur assaulted upon him
with knife on his neck and right shoulder. When Sahil (brother of
Yunus) came to rescue him, he was also assaulted by accused
Saleem and caused injuries to him. He further narrated that
accused Saleem had met him in the day time and had said ‘tune
hamare upar mukadma karaya hai, mai tujhe aaj shaam tak jaan
se maar dunga’ and also threatened him. On this, Sahil (brother
of Yunus) called at 100 number, PCR van came and took him and
his brother Sahil to the GTB hospital.”
5.      After completion of investigation, the charge sheet was filed under
Sections 307/324/506 IPC. Vide order dated 06.09.2018, charges were
framed against the appellant under Sections 307/324 IPC, to which he pled
not guilty and claimed trial.
6.      Learned counsel for the appellant contended that the testimony of
complainant/Mohd. Yunus is unreliable on account of prior enmity with the
appellant, which has been admitted by the complainant himself. It was
submitted that neither the weapon of offence was recovered during
investigation nor were the complainant’s blood-stained clothes seized.
Further, the testimony of brother of the complainant/Sahil was contended to
be unreliable on the ground that Sahil had not accompanied his brother to
the hospital. It was also submitted that the PCR Form pertaining to call on
100 number was not produced.
Learned counsel also contended that the testimonies of the
complainant and his brother have material contradictions, inasmuch as the
complainant stated that the incident had occurred at about 10:00 p.m., but
his brother stated that the incident occurred at about 8:00 p.m. It was further
contended that Dr. Deepika, who proved the nature of injuries recorded in
the MLC of the complainant, did not depose regarding preparation of the
same. Lastly, it was contended that the Investigating Officer had not
recorded the statement of any public witness. In the alternative, learned
counsel submitted that the appellant was not pressing his appeal on merit
and he may be released on the period already undergone by him.
7.      Learned APP for the State, on the other hand, supported the impugned
judgment and order. It was submitted that the testimonies of both Mohd.
Yunus and Sahil are consistent with each other and reliable, as both have
deposed that they were assaulted by the appellant, who was already known
to them.
8.      I have heard learned counsels for the parties and have also gone
through the Trial Court Record, as well as the written submissions filed on
behalf of the appellant.
9.      In support of its case, the prosecution had examined a total of seven
witnesses. The complainant/injured/Mohd. Yunus was examined as PW-1;
the complainant’s brother Sahil, who was also injured in the incident, was
examined as PW-2; Ct. Jhabar Ram (PW-3) and HC Rajender Singh (PW-4)
were examined to prove the arrest memo and registration of the FIR
respectively; Dr. Arvind Gautam, who proved the MLCs of Mohd. Yunus
and Sahil on behalf of Dr. Deepika, was examined as PW-5; ASI Surender
Pal, the Investigating Officer of the case, was examined as PW-6; Dr.
Deepika, who also proved the MLC of complainant/Mohd. Yunus wherein
nature of injury was opined as grievous by Dr. Ramandeep Kaur, was
examined as PW-7.
10.     The complainant/Mohd. Yunus deposed in his testimony that he was
residing alongwith his parents in a rented accommodation and worked as a
mechanic of sewing machines. On the day of the incident, i.e. on
24.05.2017, at about 10:00 p.m., while he was going alongwith his brother
Sahil to take medicine, the appellant came and assaulted him with a knife.
The assault resulted in injuries to the witness on his neck and on front side
of his right shoulder. When the complainant’s brother Sahil tried to save
him, he was also given a knife blow by the appellant on his left cheek. After
being assaulted, the brother of the witness made a complaint at 100 number,
whereafter PCR came to the spot and took them to the GTB Hospital. It was
further deposed that the appellant had attacked the complainant on an earlier
occasion as well with a hockey and danda, regarding which complaint was
given to the police and a case was registered. It was also deposed that in
order to take revenge, the appellant had asked the complainant about a day
prior to the day of the incident to withdraw the earlier complaint. In this
regard, he was also given life threats. After about three days of the incident
in question, the appellant came to be arrested at the instance of the witness.
He was also identified by the complainant in the Court.
In cross-examination, the witness stated that on the date of the
incident, he went to buy medicine for himself as he was having eye-pain due
to injuries which were earlier caused by the appellant. He further stated that
though he remained hospitalized for three days, his brother was discharged
on the same day. He denied the suggestion that injuries received by him
were caused by some other person and not the appellant. A suggestion that
the appellant was falsely implicated as the complainant’s family members
had enmity with some other person, or that the appellant was falsely
implicated at the instance of complainant’s family members, was also
denied. He also denied the suggestion that he had not seen the face of the
appellant at the time of incident.
11.     Sahil, i.e. the brother of Mohd. Yunus deposed that, two days prior to
the incident, the appellant had assaulted his brother in respect of which a
complaint was lodged at the police station. He further deposed that on the
day of the incident, the appellant had caused injuries on the neck and other
parts of the body of his brother with a chhurri. When he tried to save his
brother, he was also assaulted by the appellant with the chhurri on his left
cheek, whereafter the appellant ran away. Subsequently, the witness had
made a call to 100 number. While he went to call his family members, the
PCR Van took his brother/Mohd. Yunus to GTB Hospital, where he was also
taken later by the police.
In cross-examination (recalled under Section 311 Cr.P.C.), the witness
denied the suggestion that he was not present on the spot at the time of the
incident or that he had deposed falsely to implicate the appellant.
12.     Dr. Arvind Gautam, CMO, GTB Hospital, Delhi proved the MLC
dated 24.05.2017 of Mohd. Yunus (Ex.PW-5/A) and deposed that it was
prepared under his supervision by Dr. Deepika, then JR (Junior Doctor). He
identified the handwriting and signatures of Dr. Deepika on the said MLC
and stated that following injuries were noted on local examination:-
“1.       Incised would in the size of 4x2 cm on right side of chest
near shoulder.
2.       Incised wound in the size of 15x3 cm on throat extending
to chin.
3.        Old injury as mentioned in the MLC NO. A-4422/14/17.”
The witness also proved the MLC dated 25.05.2017 of Sahil (Ex.PW-
5/B). He further deposed that any opinion on the nature of injuries suffered
by Sahil could not be given as he had absconded from the casualty.
In cross-examination, a suggestion that the injuries could have
resulted from a fall was denied by the witness, since they were sharp in
13.     Dr. Deepika, Sr. Resident, ENT Department, GTB Hospital also
proved that the injuries suffered by complainant/Mohd. Yunus were grievous
in nature. In this regard, she identified the signatures of Dr. Ramandeep
Kaur on the complainant’s MLC.
14.     ASI Surender Pal, the Investigating Officer of the case, deposed that
he had recorded the statement of the complainant (Ex.PW1/A) and at his
pointing out, arrested the appellant on 27.05.2017. He also deposed that
despite best efforts, the weapon of offence could not be recovered.
15.     The appellant’s statement under Section 313 Cr.P.C. was recorded,
wherein he stated that he was falsely implicated in the present case.
16.      Needless to state, Mohd. Yunus was the star witness of the
prosecution case, being the complainant who suffered injuries at the time of
the incident. The law on appreciation of testimony of an injured witness has
been enunciated by the Supreme Court in a catena of decisions, including
State of Uttar Pradesh v. Naresh and Others reported as (2011) 4 SCC 324,
“27. The evidence of an injured witness must be given due
weightage being a stamped witness, thus, his presence cannot be
doubted. His statement is generally considered to be very
reliable and it is unlikely that he has spared the actual assailant
in order to falsely implicate someone else. The testimony of an
injured witness has its own relevancy and efficacy as he has
sustained injuries at the time and place of occurrence and this
lends support to his testimony that he was present during the
occurrence. Thus, the testimony of an injured witness is accorded
a special status in law. The witness would not like or want to let
his actual assailant go unpunished merely to implicate a third
person falsely for the commission of the offence. Thus, the
evidence of the injured witness should be relied upon unless
there are grounds for the rejection of his evidence on the basis of
major contradictions and discrepancies therein. (Vide Jarnail
Singh v. State of Punjab [(2009) 9 SCC 719, Balraje v. State of
Maharashtra (2010) 6 SCC 673 and Abdul Sayeed v. State of
17.     A perusal of the material on record in the present case would show
that the complainant/Mohd. Yunus had clearly deposed that there was pre-
existing enmity between the accused/appellant and him, as earlier also the
appellant had caused injuries to him, and in pursuance thereto a police
complaint was made. In the incident in question, the complainant received
injuries on the neck and on front shoulder, which are corroborated by his
MLC, and are alleged to have been caused by a chhurri.
Sahil, i.e. brother of the complainant, was also injured in the same
incident and he also deposed that it was the appellant who inflicted injuries
on him and his brother with a chhurri. The testimony of Sahil is not only
cumulative to the testimony of the complainant, but also consistent and it
finds corroboration from his own MLC, which has been proved on the
record as Ex.PW-5/B.
During the trial, the suggestion given on behalf of the appellant that
the injuries were possible on account of fall was denied by Dr. Arvind
Gautam as the injuries were sharp in nature. The incident is stated to have
taken place at about 10:00 p.m. The complainant’s MLC was prepared on
the same day at about 10:45 p.m., i.e. immediately after the incident. The
FIR came to be registered at 03:30 a.m. and the appellant being already
known, was named in the FIR itself.
18.     It is seen that the testimonies of both, the complainant/Mohd. Yunus
and his brother/Sahil, are consistent with their earlier statements and find
support not only from each other, but also from the respective MLCs, which
have been duly proved on record. In view of the aforesaid and the other
evidence placed on record, this Court finds the testimonies of the
complainant/Mohd. Yunus and his brother Sahil to be both creditworthy and
19.     A contention was raised on behalf of the appellant with respect to
non-recovery of the weapon of offence. In connection therewith, it is noted
that the Supreme Court has observed in Rakesh and Another v. State of Uttar
Pradesh and Another reported as (2021) 7 SCC 188 that recovery of the
weapon of offence is not a sine qua non for convicting an accused. Albeit
under Sections 302/34 IPC, the Court in this case also opined that it was not
possible to reject the ocular evidence of eye-witnesses to the incident, who
were reliable and trustworthy.
Combined with the fact that the testimonies of the complainant and
his brother Sahil are cogent and consistent, the contention raised on behalf
of the appellant that the weapon of offence was not recovered, has no merit.
The same is rejected accordingly.
20.     The next contention raised on behalf of the appellant was that the
testimonies of the complainant and his brother exhibit material contradiction
on the aspect of the time of the incident. While the complainant deposed that
the incident occurred around 10:00 p.m., his brother Sahil deposed that the
incident occurred around 08:00 p.m. In this regard, it is noted that in the
alleged history of offence recorded by the concerned Doctor in the MLC of
Sahil, it was mentioned that the physical assault took place around 10:00
p.m. as per the patient himself. Even otherwise, the contradiction, as
suggested, is immaterial, insofar as the appellant was already known to both
the injured persons and their testimonies are consistent on all other aspects
of the incident.
21.     Another contention raised on behalf of the appellant was that Dr.
Deepika had not deposed about preparation of the complainant’s MLC.
However, this contention as well lacks merit, as the said MLC was also
proved by Dr. Arvind Gautam. Dr. Arvind Gautam categorically deposed
that the complainant’s MLC was prepared under his supervision by Dr.
Deepika, who was working as a JR under him at the time. Further, while
appearing as PW-7, Dr. Deepika proved the nature of injuries appearing on
the complainant’s MLC as grievous and no suggestion was given to her in
cross-examination that she had not prepared the complainant’s MLC.
22.      It was also contended on behalf of the appellant that the blood-
stained clothes of the complainant were not seized and the PCR Form was
not produced. However, in view of the fact that the complainant was
medically examined within 45 minutes of the incident, the contention bears
no merit and is rejected.
23.     Insofar as the contention with respect to non-examination of public
witness is concerned, suffice it to note that when the testimony of an injured
complainant is consistent and finds support not only from his own MLC, but
also from the testimony of another injured, then such a contention pales into
insignificance. In this regard, it is deemed expedient to refer to the decision
of the Supreme Court in Sadakat Kotwar and Another v. State of Jharkhand
reported as 2021 SCC OnLine SC 1046, where the Court observed as
“7. …As observed and held by this Court in catena of decisions
nobody can enter into the mind of the accused and his intention
has to be ascertained from the weapon used, part of the body
chosen for assault and the nature of the injury caused.
Considering the case on hand on the aforesaid principles, when
the deadly weapon - dagger has been used, there was a stab
injury on the stomach and near the chest which can be said to be
on the vital part of the body and the nature of injuries caused, it
is rightly held that the appellants have committed the offence
under Section 307 IPC.”
24.     Note is also taken of the fact that the injuries suffered by the
complainant, allegedly caused by a chhurri, were inflicted on vital part of
his body i.e. the neck. The nature of the corresponding injury was opined to
be grievous. It was deposed by the complainant that earlier also, he was
assaulted by the appellant, pursuant to which a complaint was lodged with
the police. The appellant’s Nominal Roll also indicates that he is involved in
FIR No. 235/2017 registered under Sections 308/34 IPC at Police Station
25.     The pre-existing enmity between the appellant and the complainant,
the receipt of two injuries by the complainant during the incident, out of
which one was on vital part of the body i.e. neck, the nature of the injury
being opined as grievous would indicate that the appellant had the requisite
intention as well as the knowledge that such injuries could have been fatal.
Thus, in the opinion of this Court, the ingredients of the offence punishable
under Section 307 IPC are clearly proved against the appellant beyond any
shadow of doubt. On the same parameters, even though there was no
opinion on the nature of injury suffered by Sahil, the receipt of injury by him
was proved through his MLC.
26.     In view of the aforesaid analysis, this Court concurs with the
impugned judgment on conviction passed by the Trial Court. Accordingly,
the impugned judgment is upheld.
27.     Learned counsel for the appellant prayed that a lenient view on the
appellant’s sentence may be taken as the appellant has already undergone
about 04 years and 06 months out of the total sentence of 06 years awarded
to him and the fine imposed on him has already been deposited. It was
further stated that the appellant at the time of incident was a little over 18
years of age and he belongs to a poor family. It was also stated that the
appellant has responsibility of his parents as well as five brothers and sisters
on him.
28.     As per the Nominal Roll of the appellant available on record, he has
already undergone sentence of 04 years 05 months and 09 days as on
07.11.2021, alongwith remission of 06 months and 03 days, and his
unexpired portion of sentence is 01 year and 18 days. The fine amount is
stated to have been deposited. His jail conduct for the last one year is also
stated to be satisfactory.
29.     Keeping in view the appellant’s age, the period of incarceration, his
jail conduct for the last one year and other mitigating circumstances, this
Court deems it fit to modify the order on sentence and direct that the
appellant be released on the period already undergone by him unless
required in any other case.
30.      The appeal is dismissed insofar as challenge to the judgment on
conviction is concerned, however the order on sentence is modified to the
aforesaid extent.
31.     A certified copy of this judgment be communicated to the appellant
through the concerned Jail Superintendent and also to the Trial Court.
