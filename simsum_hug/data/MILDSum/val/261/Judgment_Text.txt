5. According to the prosecution story as unfolded in the F.I.R., it is alleged
that on 26.12.2020, first informant along with others conducted checking
of the premises of petitioner and found that electricity theft was being
6. Investigating Officer, thereafter proceeded with the statutory
investigation of aforementioned case crime number in terms of Chapter
XII Cr.P.C. During course of investigation, Investigating Officer
examined various witnesses and also collected certain documents. On the
basis of above, complicity of present applicant was found to be
established in the crime in question by Investigating Officer. Accordingly,
Investigating Officer submitted a        Charge-Sheet dated 02.02.2021,
whereby applicant has been charge-sheeted under section 135-1(A)
7. Upon submission of aforesaid charge-sheet, cognizance was taken upon
same by court concerned i.e. Special Judge (E.C. Act)/Additional District
and Sessions Judge, Ghaziabad vide Cognizance Taking Order dated
05.02.2020. Aforesaid order is contained in the charge-sheet, certified

8. As a result of above, S.S.T. No.152 of 2021 (State Vs. Gulfam) under

order-sheet Special Judge (E.C. Act)/Additional District and Sessions
Judge, Ghaziabad took cognizance and simultaneously summoned the
applicant in aforementioned Special Sessions Trial.
9. Feeling aggrieved by the charge-sheet dated 02.02.2021 and entire
proceedings of consequential S.S.T. No.152 of 2021 (State Vs. Gulfam)
under section 135-1(A) Electricity Act, Police Station- Anti Power Theft
Ghaziabad, District- Ghaziabad, now pending in the court of Special
Judge (E.C. Act)/Additional District and Sessions Judge, Ghaziabad,
applicant has now approached this Court by means of present application
under section 482 Cr.P.C.
10. Mr. Indra Deo Mishra, learned counsel for applicant contends that
applicant is innocent. He has been falsely implicated in aforementioned
case crime number. Allegations made in F.I.R. are false and concocted. No
theft of electricity has been committed by applicant. Investigating Officer
has not conducted free and fair investigation. As such, investigation is not
impartial. Investigating Officer has acted as an agent of prosecution.
Resultantly,      charge-sheet    is    tainted.    Cognizance       Taking
Order/Summoning Order passed by court below is cryptic as same is
devoid of reasons. It is also submitted that by virtue of section 193
Cr.P.C., Sessions Judge has no jurisdiction to take cognizance directly.
Sessions Judge can take cognizance only after case has been committed to
Court of Sessions. Therefore, Cognizance Taking Order/Summoning
Order passed by court below are not only irregular but illegal. As such,
entire proceedings of above-mentioned Special Sessions Trial are liable to
be quashed by this Court.
11. Per contra, the learned A.G.A. and Mr. Pranjal Mehrotra, learned
counsel representing opposite party-2 have jointly opposed this
12. Learned A.G.A. contends that after registration of F.I.R. dated
28.12.2020, Investigating Officer proceeded with statutory investigation
of same in terms of Chapter XII Cr.P.C. During course of investigation,
Investigating Officer examined first informant and other witnesses under
section 161 Cr.P.C. On the basis of above, as well as other material
collected by Investigation Officer during course of investigation which is
substantially adverse to applicants, he opined to submit a charge-sheet.
Accordingly, charge-sheet dated 02.02.2021 was submitted, whereby and
whereunder applicant has been charge-sheeted under section- 135-1(A)
Electricity Act. In the charge-sheet so submitted one prosecution witness
has been nominated. As such, it cannot be said at this stage that
prosecution of applicant is false or there is no material to support the
prosecution case. He has then referred to paragraph- 37 of the judgment in
State of Gujarat Vs. Afroz Mohammed Hasanfatta, A.I.R.
2019 Supreme Court 2499 , wherein following has been observed.
"37. For issuance of process against the accused, it has to
be seen only whether there is sufficient ground for
proceeding against the accused. At the stage of issuance of
process, the Court is not required to weigh the evidentiary
value of the materials on record. The Court must apply its
mind to the allegations in the charge sheet and the evidence
produced and satisfy itself that there is sufficient ground to
proceed against the accused. The Court is not to examine
the merits and demerits of the case and not to determine the
adequacy of the evidence for holding the accused guilty.
The Court is also not required to embark upon the possible
defences. Likewise, 'possible defences' need not be taken
into consideration at the time of issuing process unless
there is an ex- facie defence such as a legal bar or if in law
the accused is not liable. [Vide Nupur Talwar v. Central
Bureau of Investigation and another, (2012) 11 SCC 465]"
13. Learned A.G.A. further submits that whether in the facts and
circumstances of the case, charge under section 135-1(A) Electricity Act
is made out or not against applicant, can be agitated by applicant before
court below itself at the time of framing of charge.
14. It is lastly contended that in the absence of entire material, which was
collected by Investigating Officer during course of investigation, the pleas
urged for quashing of proceedings of above-mentioned criminal case,
cannot be examined by this Court, in view of law laid down in Kaptan
Singh Vs. State of U.P. and Others, 2021 SCC Online SC 580 ,
wherein following has been observed in the last line of paragraph-25. Of
15. Learned A.G.A. has then invited attention of Court to section 153
1. The State Government may, for the purposes                of
providing speedy trial of offences referred to               in
notification in the Official Gazette, constitute             as
many Special Courts as may be necessary for such
notification.
2. A Special Court shall consist of a single Judge
who shall be appointed by the State Government
with the concurrence of the High Court.
3. A person shall not be qualified for appointment
Additional District and Sessions Judge.
4. Where the office of the Judge of a Special Court
ordinary place of sitting of such Special Court, or
he is incapacitated by illness or otherwise for the
performance of his duties, any urgent business in
a. by a Judge, if any, exercising jurisdiction in the
b. where there is no such other Judge available, in
accordance with the direction of District and
Sessions Judge having jurisdiction over the
ordinary place of sitting of Special Court, as
notified under sub-section (1).‚Äù
16. On the basis of above, learned A.G.A. submits that once offence under
Electricity Act is to be tried by a Special Judge, especially designated and
further such Judge should not be below the rank of Additiona District and
Sessions Judge, the argument raised on behalf of applicant regarding
jurisdiction of Court to take cognizance in the light of section 193 Cr.P.C.
is wholly misconceived. In the submission of learned A.G.A., special law
shall over ride the general law. He has also referred to section 194 Cr.P.C.
in support of above.
17. On the aforesaid premise, learned A.G.A. contends that present
application is liable to be dismissed.
18. When confronted with above, learned counsel for applicant could not
overcome the same.
19. Having heard learned counsel for applicant, learned A.G.A. for State,
Mr. Pranjal Mehrotra, learned counsel for opposite party-2 and upon
perusal of record, this Court does not find any merit in this application.
The submissions urged by learned A.G.A. could not be dislodged by
learned counsel for applicant. Apart from above, by virtue of section 154
Electricity Act read with sections 193 and 194 Cr.P.C., it is explicitly clear
that Special Judge (E.C. Act)/Additional District and Sessions Judge,
Ghaziabad had jurisdiction in the matter to take cognizance. As such, the
Cognizance Taking Order/Summoning Order dated 05.02.2021 passed by
Special Judge (E.C. Act)/Additional District and Sessions Judge,
Ghaziabad cannot be said to be illegal or without jurisdiction.
20. In view of above, the application fails and is liable to be dismissed.
21. It is, accordingly, dismissed.
