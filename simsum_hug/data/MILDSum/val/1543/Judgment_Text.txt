In The High Court for the States of Punjab and Haryana
State of Punjab and another                                   ... Respondents
Present:-    Mr. Baljinder Singh, Advocate, for the petitioners.
The petitioners have approached this Court seeking quashing of
FIR No.165, dated 29.6.2021, Police Station Model Town, District
Hoshiarpur, under Section 306 IPC (Annexure P-1) on the basis of
Today at the very outset, learned counsel for the petitioners
submitted that apart from the grounds of compromise, he may also be
permitted to canvas his grounds for quashing of FIR on merits as well.
I have heard the learned counsel for the petitioners.
A perusal of the FIR would show that the same was lodged by
father of the deceased Avtar Chand. It is alleged that Avtar Chand was
married to Neelam Devi (petitioner No.1) about 14 years back. It is further
alleged that about 2 months back, differences had cropped up between Avtar
Chand and his wife Neelam Devi because she used to unnecessarily doubt
that Avtar Chand was having illicit relations with some lady on account of
which they often used to quarrel. It is further alleged that Neelam Devi also
used to provoke her parents, sister and brother-in-law upon which her father
Pakhar Singh, mother Satya Devi had visited their house several times and
instead of pacifying the matter, they also fueled fire inasmuch as they stated
that Avtar Chand was not having any property and cannot satisfy her
daughter. It is alleged that about 15 days back Neelam Devi had a quarrel
with Avtar Chand and left for her parental home. Although, complainant’s
son Avtar Chand contacted his in-laws and requested them to meet his wife,
but to no avail and on account of which he became upset and later
committed suicide.
Upon perusal of the FIR, this Court finds that the matter broadly
pertains to abettment of commission of suicide wherein petitioner No.1
Neelam Devi, is alleged to have raised allegations against her husband
regarding his illicit relationship with some lady and used to quarrel
repeatedly and after she left her matrimonial home a few days back she
refused to return, which had upset the deceased.
Since an offence under Section 306 IPC is alleged to have been
committed which is a heinous offence and Avtar Chand had committed
suicide, therefore, it is not just the Avtar Chand’s family who would be the
aggrieved, but the offence is broadly committed against the deceased
himself. There can be no compromise with the dead man. As such the FIR
cannot be quashed on the basis of compromise. As far as the contention of
the petitioner regarding quashing of the FIR on merits is concerned this
Court is of the opinion that the allegations of raising false allegations against
the character of deceased by Neelam Devi herself to the effect that he was
having illicit relations and subsequent quarrels with him on the said grounds
would prima-facie attract an offence of abettment to commit suicide. Even
the relatives had also played a part in the same inasmuch as they had also
been troubling the deceased. There are sufficient allegations in the FIR to
constitute the offences. No ground for quashing of FIR either on basis of
compromise or even on merits is made out.
The petition sans merit and the same is hereby dismissed.
