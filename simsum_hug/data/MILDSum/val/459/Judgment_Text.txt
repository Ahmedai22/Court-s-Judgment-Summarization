1.      The State of Maharashtra,
Advocate for the petitioners : Mr. A.D. Pawar
AGP for the Respondent Nos.1 to 6-State : Mr. A.S. Shinde
1.              Entitlement of regular pay scale to Watchmen/Security
Guards appointed in aided Ashram Schools run by the private
managements at par with those working in Government Ashram
9              wp4300 (1) .21 Judgment -2.docx
Schools, is the issue involved in the present petition.
2.              By the Government Resolution dated 23.01.2014, it was
resolved to establish a Special Education Unit for better management
of Government Ashram Schools and aided Ashram Schools under the
Tribal Development Department of the State. It was further resolved to
create 849 posts for establishment of such Special Education Unit. In
addition to such 849 newly created posts, it was also resolved to create
556 posts of Watchmen/Security Guards for 556 aided private Ashram
Schools. It was decided to fill up such posts of Watchmen/Security
Guards on consolidated monthly honorarium of Rs. 3200/-. By
subsequent          Government        Resolution  dated        18.06.2016,             such
honorarium was enhanced to Rs. 5,000/-.
3.              The petitioner No. 1 is a Union of teaching and non-
teaching staff working in Ashram Schools of the Tribal Development
Department. Petitioner Nos. 2 to 59 are working as Watchmen/Security
Guards       in   various       aided Ashram   Schools    run       by     the      private
managements. They have filed present petition claiming the same pay
scales, which are granted to the post of Watchmen/Security Guards in
Government Ashram Schools. It is contended that by way of
Government Resolution dated 14.09.2004, it has been directed that the
educational qualifications applicable to the teaching and non-teaching
staff in the Government Ashram Schools is made applicable to those
10               wp4300 (1) .21 Judgment -2.docx
engaged in aided private Ashram Schools. The petitioners also rely
upon Government Resolution dated 20.08.2019, by which the revised
staffing pattern has been implemented for Government Ashram
Schools and aided Private Ashram Schools, under which one post of
Watchman has been sanctioned for each Ashram School with a further
direction that the eligibility criteria for filling up the posts of Watchmen
would be the same as prescribed for the Government Ashram Schools.
The petitioners also rely upon the Government Resolution dated
13.12.2019, by which the nomenclature of post of Watchman is
changed to that of Multi Tasking Staff and a pay band of 15000-47600
has been prescribed for the same. The petitioners contend that despite
issuance of Government Resolution dated 13.12.2019, the same is not
implemented and the petitioners continue to be paid monthly
consolidated honorarium of Rs. 5,000/-.
4.              The petition is resisted by the State Government by filing
affidavit-in-reply. Reliance is placed on the Government Resolution
dated 11.05.2022 issued during the pendency of the present petition,
by     which      the     Government  Resolutions      dated       18.07.2019         and
20.08.2019 have been stayed. It is contended that the Government
Resolution dated 20.08.2019 was conditional i.e. subject to approval to
be given by the appropriate authority. It is further contended that the
post being temporary and on honorarium, the same cannot be replaced
in regular pay scale and that, therefore, monthly consolidated
honorarium of Rs. 5,000/- is rightly being paid as per the Government
11              wp4300 (1) .21 Judgment -2.docx
5.              Appearing for the petitioners Mr. Pawar, the learned counsel
would invoke the principle of ‘equal pay for equal work’ for claiming the
pay scales payable to the Watchmen/Security Guards engaged in the
Government Ashram Schools. He would submit that the Petitioners
perform        same        duties and   responsibilities      as       that       of the
Watchmen/Security Guards engaged in the Government Ashram
Schools. That the eligibility criteria for both posts is the same. He would
submit that the Government Resolution dated 11.05.2022 has been
issued to defeat the legitimate claim of the petitioners. He questioned
the timing of issuance of the GR and submitted that the same is a
retaliatory reaction to this Court proposing to saddle costs of Rs.
50,000/- by its order dated 28.04.2022 for not filing affidavit-in-reply.
6.              Mr. Pawar relies upon the following judgments in support of
his contentions :
1. State of Harayana Vs. Rajpal Sharma 1996
3. State of Punjab and others V/s Jagjit Singh
and Others 2017 (1) SCC 148.
Officer and others 2019 (12) SCC 297.
7.              Mr. Shinde, the learned Assistant Government Pleader
appearing for the State Government would contend that the terms and
12             wp4300 (1) .21 Judgment -2.docx
conditions of the appointments were clearly made known to the
petitioners and they have accepted the appointments on consolidated
monthly       honorarium.        The petitioners cannot turn around and claim
regular pay scales.             He submits that the posts are temporary and
therefore the regular pay scales cannot be granted to the post of
Watchmen/Security Guards in private aided Ashram Schools. He would
further submit that the Government Resolution dated 20.08.2019 is in
conflict with the earlier Government Resolutions dated 23.01.2014 and
18.06.2016, which were ignored while issuing Government Resolution
dated 20.08.2019. He, therefore, submits that the State Government
has rightly stayed operation of the Government Resolution dated
20.08.2019. So far as, the Government Resolution dated 13.12.2019 is
concerned, he submits that the object behind issuance of the
Government Resolution was not merely to make changes in the
nomenclature of the posts and not to prescribe particular pay scale/pay
band. Mr. Shinde would rely upon the following decisions in support of
his contentions:-
1. Orissa University of Agricultural and
2. Utkal          University    and     Another              Vs.
Jyotirmayee Nayak and Others 2003 DGLS

7. P.S. Gopinathan Vs. State of Kerala &
8. State of Uttar Pradesh through its

8.              In the above backdrop, we are tasked upon to decide the
issue of entitlement of regular pay scale to Watchmen/Security Guards
appointed in aided Ashram Schools run by the private managements at
par with those working in Government Ashram Schools. At the outset,
we are mindful of the settled legal position that prescription of pay
scale is a matter of policy decision. The limitations imposed on writ
jurisdiction of this Court in entering into the realm of policy decisions
need no reiteration. It is trite that this Court cannot issue directions to
apply/implement particular pay scale for a particular post, the same
being in exclusive domain of the executive. Equally true is that this
Court cannot embark upon the exercise of equating the duties or
responsibilities for deciding applicability of a particular pay scale, the
same being the job of experts. Keeping in mind the above limitations,
we proceed to answer the issue raised in the Petition.
14            wp4300 (1) .21 Judgment -2.docx
9.              The petitioners have been appointed/engaged consequent
to the sanction of 556 posts of Watchmen/Security Guards for 556
aided Ashram Schools run by private managements. The Government
Resolution dated 23.01.2014 creates two separate categories in
respect of total 1961 newly sanctioned posts. The first category is in
respect of 849 posts sanctioned for Special Education Unit, for which
there is no specific provision for payment of honorarium. It therefore
appears that regular payscales are payable in respect of those 849
posts.     However, in respect of 556 posts of Woman Superintendents
and 556 posts of Watchmen/Security Guards, a specific provision is
made for payment of monthly consolidated honorarium of Rs. 3200/-.
Thus, there is no iota of doubt that sanction of said 556 posts of
Watchmen/Security Guards was with a specific caveat that the same
can be filled only on the basis of condition of payment of consolidated
monthly       honorarium          of  Rs.  3200/-. Such     monthly         consolidated
honorarium was subsequently enhanced to Rs. 5,000/- by Government
Resolution dated 18.06.2016, which not only provides that the
engagement would not be on regular basis but also imposes condition
of submission of undertaking/affidavit from personnel appointed on the
post not to claim regularization. The Government Resolution further
provides that the engagement of Watchmen/Security Guards would
only be for a period of 11 months, after which the same can be
continued with technical break. Mr. Shinde, therefore, would be justified
in contending that creation of posts was conditional and the same is
governed        by     the      provisions  of Government         Resolutions           dated
15             wp4300 (1) .21 Judgment -2.docx
10.             However,        we are   not  concerned      with        the     issue   of
regularization of services of the petitioners. There is no prayer in the
present petition seeking regularization of their services. The prayers in
the present petition are restricted only to grant of same pay scale to
the petitioners which is granted to the post of Watchman/Security
Guard employed in Government run Ashram Schools. Therefore, the
issue of the posts being temporary in nature needs to be considered for
limited aspect of extension of pay scale to the holders of the posts.
11.             The issue of extension of principle of ‘equal pay for equal
work’ to temporary employees attracted the attention of the Apex
Court in State of Punjab Vs. Jagjit Singh (supra). After considering
the previous decisions, the Apex Court held as under:
“54. There is no room for any doubt, that the
principle of ‘equal pay for equal work’ has emerged
from an interpretation of different provisions of the
Constitution. The principle has been expounded
through a large number of judgments rendered by
this Court, and constitutes law declared by this
Court. The same is binding on all the courts in
India, under Article 141 of the Constitution of India.
The parameters of the principle, have been
summarized by us in paragraph 42 hereinabove.
The principle of ‘equal pay for equal work’ has also
been        extended     to    temporary      employees
(differently described as work-charge, daily-wage,
16          wp4300 (1) .21 Judgment -2.docx
casual, ad-hoc, contractual, and the like). The legal
position, relating to temporary employees, has
been summarized by us, in paragraph 44
hereinabove. The above legal position which has
been repeatedly declared, is being reiterated by
us, yet again.
55. In our considered view, it is fallacious to
determine artificial parameters to deny fruits of
labour. An employee engaged for the same work,
cannot be paid less than another, who performs the
same duties and responsibilities. Certainly not, in a
welfare state. Such an action besides being
demeaning, strikes at the very foundation of
human dignity. Any one, who is compelled to work
at a lesser wage, does not do so voluntarily. He
does so, to provide food and shelter to his family,
at the cost of his self respect and dignity, at the
cost of his self worth, and at the cost of his
integrity. For he knows, that his dependents would
suffer immensely, if he does not accept the lesser
wage. Any act, of paying less wages, as compared
to others similarly situate, constitutes an act of
exploitative enslavement, emerging out of a
domineering position. Undoubtedly, the action is
oppressive, suppressive and coercive, as it
compels involuntary subjugation.
57. Having traversed the legal parameters with
reference to the application of the principle of
‘equal pay for equal work’, in relation to temporary
employees          (daily-wage employees,           ad-hoc
appointees, employees appointed on casual basis,
contractual employees and the like), the sole factor
that requires our determination is, whether the
concerned employees (before this Court), were
rendering similar duties and responsibilities, as
were being discharged by regular employees,
holding the same/corresponding posts. This
exercise would require the application of the
parameters of the principle of ‘equal pay for equal
work’ summarized by us in paragraph 42 above.
However, insofar as the instant aspect of the
matter is concerned, it is not difficult for us to
record the factual position. We say so, because it
was fairly acknowledged by the learned counsel
representing the State of Punjab, that all the
temporary employees in the present bunch of
appeals, were appointed against posts which were
17             wp4300 (1) .21 Judgment -2.docx
also available in the regular cadre/establishment. It
was also accepted, that during the course of their
employment, the concerned temporary employees
were being randomly deputed to discharge duties
and responsibilities, which at some point in time,
were assigned to regular employees. Likewise,
regular employees holding substantive posts, were
also posted to discharge the same work, which was
assigned to temporary employees, from time to
time. There is, therefore, no room for any doubt,
that the duties and responsibilities discharged by
the temporary employees in the present set of
appeals, were the same as were being discharged
by regular employees. It is not the case of the
appellants, that the respondent-employees did not
possess          the qualifications prescribed             for
appointment on regular basis. Furthermore, it is
not the case of the State, that any of the
temporary employees would not be entitled to pay
parity, on any of the principles summarized by us
in paragraph 42 hereinabove. There can be no
doubt, that the principle of ‘equal pay for equal
work’ would be applicable to all the concerned
temporary employees, so as to vest in them the
right to claim wages, at par with the minimum of
the pay-scale of regularly engaged Government
employees, holding the same post.
58. In view of the position expressed by us in the
foregoing paragraph, we have no hesitation in
holding, that all the concerned temporary
employees, in the present bunch of cases, would
be entitled to draw wages at the minimum of the
pay-scale (- at the lowest grade, in the regular pay-
scale), extended to regular employees, holding the
12.            The law expounded Jagjit Singh (supra) was reiterated by
the Apex Court in Sabha Shankar Dube (Supra) in which it is held as
“10. The issue that was considered by this Court
in Jagjit Singh (supra) is whether temporary
employees (daily wage employees, ad hoc
appointees, employees appointed on casual basis,
18               wp4300 (1) .21 Judgment -2.docx
contractual employees and likewise) are entitled to
the minimum of the regular pay scales on account
of their performing the same duties which are
discharged by those engaged on regular basis
against the sanctioned posts. After considering
several judgments including the judgments of this
Court in Tilak Raj (supra) and Surjit Singh (supra)
this Court held that temporary employees are
entitled to draw wages at the minimum of the pay
scales which are applicable to the regular
employees holding the same post.
11. In view of the judgment in Jagjit Singh (supra),
we are unable to uphold the view of the High Court
that the Appellants-herein are not entitled to be
paid the minimum of the pay scales. We are not
called upon to adjudicate on the rights of the
Appellants relating to the regularization of their
services. We are concerned only with the principle
laid down by this Court initially in Putti Lal (supra)
relating to persons who are similarly situated to the
Appellants and later affirmed in Jagjit Singh (supra)
that temporary employees are entitled to minimum
of the pay scales as long as they continue in
service.”
13.             We may also refer to Suman Forwarding Agency Pvt
10318 in which Delhi High Court has passed series of orders directing
the Central Government to implement the directions in Jagjit Singh
(supra) in respect of all casual labourers and contract workers engaged
by the Central Government and PSUs. In Order dated 16 th September
2019, the Delhi High Court has reproduced various Office Memoranda
issued by the Central Government Ministries. Since various OM are
culled out in that order, we deem it appropriate to reproduce the order
at the cost of making this judgment lengthy. The Order reads thus:

“3. Vide order dated 28th March, 2019, Central Gov-
ernment was directed to file a status report on affi-
davit as to whether all Government Departments/
PSUs/Corporations under the Central Government
including CWC are complying with the law declared
by the Supreme Court in Jagjit Singh, (supra). Para
25 of the order dated 28 th March, 2019 is repro-
duced hereunder:
“25. The Central Government is directed to file
the status report on affidavit as to whether all
Government Departments/PSUs/Corporations un-
der the Central Government including CWC are
complying with the law declared by the Supreme
Court in Jagjit Singh (supra) by paying the wages
in terms of the directions of the Supreme Court
to the temporarily engaged employees (daily-
wage employees, ad-hoc appointees, employees
appointed on casual basis, contractual employ-
ees and the like). If all the Government Depart-
ments/PSUs/Corporations are not complying with
the directions of the Supreme Court in Jagjit
Singh (supra), the Government shall forthwith is-
sue O.M. to all the Government Departments/
PSUs/Corporations to comply with the aforesaid
directions and place the same before this Court
on the next date of hearing.”
4. On 01st August, 2019, the status report was filed
by the Central Government in which it was stated
that the matter relating to equal pay for equal work
for the workmen employed by the contractor is
regulated by Rule 25(2)(v) of the Contract Labour
(Regulation and Abolition) Central Rules, 1971. Rel-

On the above subject, the undersigned is directed to
refer to various instructions issued by the Hon'ble
Supreme Court and also to the DOPT's OM dated
49014/1/2017-Estt.(C) pt. dated 04' September,

casual worker/daily wager employed by Central Pub-
lic Sector Enterprises (CPSEs):
i. Where the nature of work entrusted to the
casual workers and regular employees is the
same, the casual workers may be paid at the
rate of 1/30th of the pay at the minimum of
the relevant pay scale plus dearness allowance
for work of 8 hours a day.
ii. In cases where the work done by a casual
worker is different from the work done by a
regular employee, the casual worker may be
paid only the minimum wages notified by the
Ministry of Labour & Employment or the state
whichever is higher as per the Minimum Wage
iii. Persons on daily wages (casual workers)
should not be recruited for work of regular
nature.
3. All CEOs of CPSEs and administrative Minis-
tries/Departments are requested to ensure
strict compliance of the above provisions.”
(Emphasis supplied)
7. All the Departments of the Ministry of Central
Government as well as PSUs under the Central Gov-
ernment are directed to comply with the office
memorandums dated 07th June, 1988, 04th Septem-
ber, 2019 and 13th September, 2019 and file the
status report with respect to the compliance thereof
before the Central Government. The compliance re-
port shall clarify how many casual/temporary work-
ers were working under those PSUs and the date
from which they were given benefits. The Central
Government shall produce all the compliance re-
ports before this Court on the next date of hearing.
The Central Government shall circulate the copy of
this order to all the Ministries and PSUs.”
14.            Thus, towards implementation of Jagjit Singh (supra), the
Central Government has already issued instructions to its Ministries
and PSUs that where the nature of work performed by causal workers is
same as that of regular employees, wages at the minimum of the
payscale are required to be paid. Thus it is now a settled law that the
employees who are not regular, irrespective of their nomenclature such
as ‘Temporary, Work Charge, Daily Wage, Casual, Ad-hoc or Contract
Basis,’ are required to be granted minimum of pay scale at the lowest
grade of regular pay scale as extended to the regular employees
holding the same post.
15.            We may also make useful reference to the case of
Ambulance Drivers engaged by various Zilla Parishads through
Contractors. Such Ambulance Drivers have filed series of petitions
before this Court seeking wages at the minimum of payscale relying on
24            wp4300 (1) .21 Judgment -2.docx
the judgment in Jagjit Singh. It is pertinent to note that the Ambulance
Drivers are engaged through contractors and not directly by Zilha
Parishad, Chandrapur and Ors., Writ Petition No. 2247 of 2014
decided on 20.11.2019, this Court held that such Ambulance drivers
are entitled to be paid wages at the minimum of the payscale. The
decision in Dhiraj Wankhede & Ors. (supra) was followed by this Court
in Ashok Dhondiba Meher and Ors. v. The Chief Executive
Officer, Zilla Parishad, Solapur. That judgment came to be assailed
by the Zilla Parishad, Solapur before the Apex Court in Special Leave
Petition (C) No. 8395 of 2021, The Chief Executive Officer, Zilla
Parishad, Solapur. Vs. Ashok Dhondiba Meher and Ors. By its
order dated 23.03.2022 the Apex Court upheld the decision of this
Court relying upon the judgment in Jagjit Singh (Supra).                     The Apex
“10.        In the above circumstance, it is noticed
that in the present facts the only relief granted by
the High Court to the private respondents herein is
to be paid the wages at the minimum of the pay-
scale at lowest grade, in the regular pay-scale
extended to the regular employees holding the
same post. The said benefit ordered to be extended
is in tune with the observations of this Court in
Jagjit Singh (supra). Further, in the instant facts
what cannot be overlooked is also that the private
respondents though employed through the
contractors are discharging the onerous duties of
driving the ambulance which is operated to provide
the benefit of public health to the citizens in the
PHC’s under the Zilla Parishad which in turn is for
discharging the obligation of the State. Therefore,
in such circumstances, the minimum relief that has
25             wp4300 (1) .21 Judgment -2.docx
been granted by the High Court would not call for
interference. We at this juncture also take note of
the fact that the judgment dated 20.11.2019
passed by the coordinate bench of the High Court
in Dhiraj S. Wankhede ( supra), relied upon by
the High Court in the instant case had been
assailed before this Court in a Special Leave
Petition (Civil) bearing Diary No. 12195/2020.
However, the Special Leave Petition came to be
dismissed by this Court on 22.02.2021.”
Thus extension of payscale to Ambulance Drivers is upheld
by the Apex Court, even though they are not appointed by Zilha
Parishads but by contractors.
16.             Applying the principle of Jagjit Singh (supra) to the
present case, it is apparent that the State Government has clearly
discriminated Watchmen/Security Guards engaged in aided private
Ashram Schools viz.-a-viz their counterparts in Government Ashram
Schools. True it is that the sanction of posts of Watchmen/Security
Guards in private aided Ashram School was conditional i.e. on payment
of monthly consolidated honorarium. However, the question that arises
is whether the State Government was justified in doing so? As observed
by us herein above, the Government Resolution dated 23.01.2014
which created the posts of Watchmen/Security Guards in private aided
Ashram School was silent about the pay scale/honorarium payable in
respect of 849 posts created in Special Education Unit for better
management of Government and aided Ashram Schools.                        It appears
26           wp4300 (1) .21 Judgment -2.docx
that for the said 849 posts the regular pay scales are paid. However, in
respect of posts of Woman Superintendent and Watchmen/Security
Guards, a special provision is made for payment of monthly honorarium
of Rs. 3200/-. Subsequent Government Resolution dated 18.06.2016
stipulates that the engagement on the post of Watchmen/Security
Guards would be temporary for 11 months while enhancing monthly
consolidated honorarium of Rs. 5,000/-.
17.             We are however not concerned with the issue whether the
appointment is against permanent or temporary post.                   From various
Government Resolutions, it does appear that the posts are temporary.
Consequently, the appointments are also temporary. However, for such
temporary         posts       and temporary appointments,            whether       the
Government is justified in paying the consolidated monthly honorarium
or whether the regular pay scales ought to have been granted is the
issue before us. Applying the principle laid down by the Apex Court in
Jagjit Singh (supra) the State Government is obliged to extend the
same pay scales to temporary employees on par with regular
employees. Undeniably, the Watchman/Security Guards appointed in
Government Ashram School are being paid regular pay scales.
Therefore, as per the law laid down in Jagjit Singh (supra), it is
mandatory for the State Government to extend the regular pay scales
to Watchmen/Security Guards engaged in private aided Ashram
Schools on par with their counterparts in the Government Ashram
18.             The issue of payment of same salary and allowances to the
teachers in privately managed aided Schools at par with the teachers
in Government Schools has been decided by the Apex Court in Rajpal
Sharma (supra). The Supreme Court followed its earlier decision in
Haryana State Adhyapak Singh v. State of Harayana (1988) 4
SCC 571 in which it is held that,
“In paragraph 12 of the Judgment the Court issued
the following directions:
'(i) The pay scales of the teachers of government
aided schools shall be revised so as to bring
them at par with the pay scales of teachers of
government schools with effect from 1/4/1979
and the differential amount as a result of such
revision in pay scales shall be paid in four six
monthly instalments, the first instalment being
payable by 30/6/1990.
(ii) The teachers of the government aided
schools shall be paid additional dearness
allowance on the basis of revised pay scales with
effect from 1/4/1979 to 31/12/1985 and the
arrears of such additional dearness allowance
found payable as a result of such revision shall
be paid along with the last part of the five
instalments of additional dearness allowance
which is to be paid in September 1990.
(iii) The parity in the pay scales and dearness
allowance of teachers employed in aided schools
and those employed in government schools shall
be maintained and with that end in view the pay
scales of teachers employed in government
aided schools shall be revised and brought at par
28             wp4300 (1) .21 Judgment -2.docx
with the pay scales and dearness allowance
payable         to the   teachers     employed           in
government schools with effect from 1-1-1986.”
19.             The issue of payment of same salary to the teachers in
privately managed aided Schools, once again came up before the
Supreme Court in Chandigarh Administration v. Rajni Vali (supra)
in which it was held in paragraph No. 9 as follows :
“Tested on the touch stone of the principles laid
down in the aforementioned decisions, the position
is manifest that there is no justification for denying
the claim of the respondents for parity of pay scale
and to accept the contention of the appellants will
amount to confirming the discriminatory treatment
against the respondents. Therefore, the High Court
rightly rejected the case of the appellants. The
directions issued in the impugned Judgment to pay
the respondents 1 to 12 the same salary as is being
paid to their- counter parts in the privately
managed Government aided schools in Chandigarh
in the circumstances is unassailable.”
20.             Thus, it is well established principle that the teachers
engaged in privately managed aided Schools cannot be discriminated
vis-a-vis their counterparts working in the Government Schools.
Applying same principle, no discrimination can be made even with
regard to the watchmen engaged in aided Ashram Schools and
21.             Great deal of emphasis is laid by Mr. Pawar on the
Government Resolution dated 20.08.2019, by which revised staffing
29              wp4300 (1) .21 Judgment -2.docx
pattern has been implemented for Government Ashram Schools and
the aided Ashram Schools, under which the one post of Watchman has
been sanctioned for each Ashram School with a further direction that
the eligibility criteria for filling up the posts of Watchmen would be the
same as prescribed for the Government Ashram Schools. Government
Resolution dated 20.08.2019 was in vogue at the time of filing of the
Petition.     If   the      Government   Resolution     dated       20-08-2019         was
operational, Watchmen/Security Guards in private aided Ashram
Schools would have been straight way entitled to regular pay scale.
However, the same has been subsequently suspended by issuing
Government Resolution dated 11-05-2022. Petitioners contend that
such suspension was made only to defeat their case. We would steer
clear of the controversy, as are not called upon to decide the legality of
the Government Resolution dated 11-05-2022. However, suffice it to
note that a conscious decision was taken by the State Government to
bring the post of Watchman on staffing pattern of the private aided
Ashram Schools. This indicates that the State Government itself treats
the Watchmen engaged in private aided Ashram Schools on par with
those      engaged        in    Government  Ashram      Schools.         We      note   the
Government Resolution dated 20-08-2019 only for the limited purpose
of holding that there appears to be no difference in the duties and
responsibilities between Watchmen engaged in private aided Ashram
Schools and those engaged in Government Ashram Schools. Also, it is
not the case of the State Government that there is any difference in the
duties and responsibilities. It has also come on record that the
30                wp4300 (1) .21 Judgment -2.docx
recruitment          qualifications    of    watchmen         engaged             on     both
establishments are same.
22.             Petitioners      have   also   relied     upon        the     Government
Resolution        dated       13.12.2019,   by    which      while         changing       the
nomenclature of the post of watchmen to that of Multi Tasking Staff, a
pay band for the post is also prescribed. Mr. Shinde has contended that
the object behind the Government Resolution dated 13.12.2019 was
merely to alter the nomenclature of the post of Watchmen/Security
Guards to that of Multi Tasking Staff and that the same applies only to
the Government Ashram Schools. However, from the Government
Resolution dated 13.12.2019, it does appear that the pay band of
15000- 47600 is made applicable to the post of Watchmen working on
the Government Ashram Schools, whose nomenclature is now changed
to that of Multi Tasking Staff. This is something which the State
Government will have to take into consideration, while implementing
our directions issued in the present judgment.
23.             What remains now is to deal with various judgments relied
upon by Mr. Shinde. In Orissa University of Agricultural and
Technology (supra) the decision was rendered essentially on account
of absence of necessary averments and material. The respondent
therein failed to prove that he had a right to equal pay on the principle
31            wp4300 (1) .21 Judgment -2.docx
of equal pay for equal work. The decision is therefore, clearly
distinguishable. In Utkal University and Another (supra) the issue
was essentially with regard to regularization of services of respondent
therein. In the present case the relief of regularization is not sought for
by the petitioners. So far as the issue of payment of salary at par with
similarly placed employees was concerned, the Supreme Court held
that the respondents therein did not possess any appointment orders,
on the basis of which they could claim the pay scale or regular salary.
Even otherwise, the judgment did not involve the specific issue of
paying pay scale to the temporary employees, whereas this specific
issue has been dealt with by the judgment of the Apex Court in Jagjit
Singh (supra). In Harbans Lal (supra) the comparison was made by
the carpenters engaged by the Himachal Pradesh State Handicraft
Corporation with that of the carpenters employed in the Government
service. In such circumstances, the Supreme Court held that the
discrimination complained of must be within the same establishment
owned by the same management. We are dealing with the issue of
extension of payscales to same category of staff engaged in
Government and aided Ashram Schools.               The decision is therefore,
clearly distinguishable.
24.             Strong reliance has been placed my Mr. Shinde on the
decision in        State of Madhya Pradesh Vs. R.D. Sharma and
Another        (supra)       contending  that the  same       is      rendered       after
considering the judgment in Jagjit Singh (supra). The case involved
32              wp4300 (1) .21 Judgment -2.docx
equation of posts and determination of pay scales and the Supreme
Court has held that the same is the function of the executive and not of
the judiciary. However, the issue of payment of pay scale to temporary
employees was not involved in that case, which is why Jagjit Singh is
held to be inapplicable. In State of Harayana Civil Secretariat
Personal Staff Association, (supra) the High Court had allowed the
Writ Petition without comparing the nature of duties and responsibilities
of two sections of employees and the qualifications prescribed were
also different. Based on these factors, the plea of equal pay for equal
work was turned down. Mr. Shinde, the learned AGP has particularly
relied upon the findings relating to financial burden of the State to be
considered and that the Court should approach the matter with
restraint and should interfere only when it is satisfied with the decision
of the Government is patently unjust and prejudice to a Section of
employees. The defence of financial burden, in our opinion, would no
longer be available to the State Government after decision in Jagjit
Singh.      The law that stands as of today is that decision to engage
temporary, casual or contract workforce is required to be taken by the
Government keeping in mind the principles in Jagjit Singh mandating
extension of minimum pay in the pay scale payable to regular
25.             In Punjab State Electricity Board (supra) the Apex Court
has re-stated the settled principle that equation of pay scales must be
left to Government and on decision of experts and that the Court
33              wp4300 (1) .21 Judgment -2.docx
should not interfere with it. We are in respectful agreement with the
said proposition. However, the issue involved in the present case is not
about equation of pay scales of two posts. The issue is about the
extension of pay scales of temporary employees who are being paid
honorarium in the light of the law laid down in Jagjit Singh (supra).
Therefore, the decision is clearly distinguishable. P.S. Gopinathan
(supra) is relied upon in support of the contention that having accepted
appointments on payments of honorarium, the petitioners are estopped
from claiming the pay scales. We are afraid, the principle of estoppel
cannot be invoked in the case before us as the Apex Court in Jagjit
Singh (supra) has specifically dealt with this aspect and has held that
“In the light, who is compelled to work on lesser
wage does not do so voluntarily. He does so, to
provide food and shelter to his family, at the cost of
his self respect and dignity, at the cost of his self
worth, and at the cost of his integrity. For he
knows, that his dependents would suffer
immensely, if he does not accept the lesser wage.
Any act, of paying less wages, as compared to
others similarly situate, constitutes an act of
exploitative enslavement, emerging out of a
domineering position. Undoubtedly, the action is
oppressive, suppressive and coercive, as it
compels involuntary subjugation.”
Thus, the principle of estoppel cannot be invoked while
deciding the issue of grant of pay scales to the temporary employees.
26.             Considering the sound exposition of law on principle of
equal pay for equal work to temporary employees in Jagjit Singh
34              wp4300 (1) .21 Judgment -2.docx
(supra), we have no hesitation in holding that the petitioners are
required to be granted minimum pay in the payscale admissible for the
post of Watchmen/Security Guards/Multi-Tasking Staff engaged in the
Government Ashram Schools. The monitory benefits arising out of
extension of payscale are however required to be restricted to three
years prior to the date of filing of the Petition i.e. w.e.f. 02-02-2018 or
from the date of appointment, in the event of appointment being made
27.              Consequently, we proceed to pass the following order:
(i)      We direct the respondents to pay to the petitioners
wages at the minimum of payscale admissible for the
post of Watchmen/Security Guards/Multi-Tasking Staff
engaged in the Government Ashram Schools.
(ii)     Monitory benefits arising out of extension of such pay
scale is however restricted to three years prior to the
filing of the present petition i.e. w.e.f. 02.02.2018 or
from the date of engagement of the respective
petitioners, whichever is later.
(iii)    Writ Petition is allowed in above terms.
(iv)     There shall be no orders as to costs.
