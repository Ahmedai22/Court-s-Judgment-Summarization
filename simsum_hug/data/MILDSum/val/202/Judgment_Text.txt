the Karkardooma Court.
4. Learned counsel for the respondent has vehemently opposed the same.
It has been submitted that the respondent –husband is 72 years of age.
Learned counsel for the respondent submits that even in the affidavit,
wrong address has been given. Learned counsel also submits that the
petitioner-wife has been enjoying all the benefits and the present
application has been moved just to harass the respondent.

particularly in the matrimonial disputes, has to be undertaken in such
a manner that there should not be any inconvenience caused to either

convenience of the wife has to be seen more. The request of the
petitioner-wife can be declined only if there are weighty reasons
behind the same.
