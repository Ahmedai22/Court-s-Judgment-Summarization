1.     This petition, under Article 227 of the Constitution of India,
assails order dated 26th May, 2022 passed by the learned Additional
District Judge (“the learned ADJ”) in CS 129/2022 whereby an
application under Section 9 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908
(CPC) read with Sections 50 and 44 of the Delhi Rent Control Act,
1958 (“the DRC Act”), filed by the petitioners, as the defendants in
the said suit, was dismissed by the learned ADJ. The contention of the
petitioners was that, by operation of Section 9 of the CPC and Section
50 read with Section 44 of the DRC Act, the suit was maintainable
only before the Rent Controller.
2.     Needless to say, the merit of this submission would have to be
examined on the basis of the case set out in the plaint of the
respondents vis-a-vis the aforesaid statutory provisions.
3.      The respondents claimed to be tenants of a shop situated at 1,
Qutub Road, Sadar Bazar, Delhi (the suit property), of which Baba
Barat Ali Shah was the landlord. Consequent to the demise of Baba
Barat Ali Shah, Petitioner 1 claimed to have become the owner of the
suit property. The ownership of Petitioner 1 was, however, disputed
by the respondent in the suit.
4.      These aspects, need not, however, detain this Court as they are
not strictly relevant to adjudication of the controversy at hand. Suffice
it to state that the plaint alleged that the petitioners were vandalising
the suit property and were interfering with its peaceful occupation by
the respondents. It was also alleged that the petitioners had caused
considerable damage to the suit property, by way of proof whereof
photographs were also filed in the plaint, and, that the petitioners were
liable to repair the damage caused by them.
5.      Predicated on these allegations, the suit prayed thus:
It is respectfully prayed this Hon'ble Court may:-
A.       A Decree of permanent injunction be passed in favour
of plaintiff and against the Defendants thereby restraining
them, their relatives, employees, agents, labour or any person
claiming through them, from interfering in the peaceful
possession and enjoyment of the tenanted shop and from
causing any damage to the tenanted shop or from putting
water in the shop from the roof in the tenanted premises;
B.      A decree of Mandatory. injunction in favour of the
Plaintiff and against the Defendants thereby directing the
Defendants to carry out necessary repair in the roof of the
tenanted shop including the basement so that there would be

including the basement and the Defendants be directed to give

while carrying on the repair work in the tenanted shop.
C.      A decree of damages for a. sum of Rs. 3,00,000/- in
favour of the Plaintiff and against the Defendants.
D.      Costs of the suit be also awarded in favour of the
Plaintiff and against the Defendants.
E.      Such other .and further orders, which this Hon'ble
Court may deem fit and proper in the' circumstances of the
case, be also passed.”
6.     The aforesaid suit is presently pending adjudication before the
learned ADJ.
7.     In the aforesaid suit, the petitioners, as the defendants in the suit
filed an application under Section 9 of the CPC read with Sections 50
and 44 of the DRC Act, alleging that the suit was not maintainable
before the learned Civil Judge, but would lie, instead, before the Rent
Controller. As such, it was prayed that the suit be dismissed as not
maintainable.
8.     The aforesaid application, filed by the petitioners, stands
dismissed by the impugned order dated 26th May, 2022, passed by the
learned ADJ.
9.     Aggrieved thereby, the petitioners have invoked the jurisdiction
vested in this Court by way of Article 227 of the Constitution of India.
10.    As such, the only issue that arises for consideration in the
present case is as to whether CS 129/2022, filed by the respondent
against the petitioners was, or was not, maintainable before the learned
11.    This question is easily answered on a bare reading of Sections
50 and 44 of the DRC Act, and Section 9 of the CPC. Section 9 is the
provision, in the CPC, which counterbalances Section 50 of the DRC
12.    Section 9 of the CPC reads thus:
“9.     Courts to try all civil suits unless barred --
The Courts shall subject to the provisions herein
contained have jurisdiction to try all suits of a civil
nature excepting suits of which their cognizance is
either expressly or impliedly barred.
Explanation I. – A suit in which the right to property or
to an office is contested is a suit of a civil nature,
notwithstanding that such right may depend entirely on
the decision of questions as to religious rites or
ceremonies.
Explanation II. – For the purposes of this section, it is
immaterial whether or not any fees are attached to the
office referred to in Explanation I or whether or not
such office is attached to a particular place.”
Clearly, therefore, Section 9 empowers Courts to try all suits of a civil
nature excepting suits in respect of which taking of cognizance is
expressly or impliedly barred.
13.    The case of the petitioners was that, as the taking of cognizance,
by the Civil Court, of CS 129/2022 was expressly barred by Section
50 of the DRC Act, applying Section 9 of the CPC, the suit would not
lie before the learned Civil Judge.
14.    Section 50(1) of the DRC Act reads thus:
“50. Jurisdiction of civil courts barred in respect of
certain matters. –
(1)    Save as otherwise expressly provided in this
Act, no civil court shall entertain any suit or
proceeding in so far as it relates to the fixation of
standard rent in relation to any premises to which this
Act applies or to eviction of any tenant therefrom or to
or under this Act to decide, and no injunction in respect
of any action taken or to be taken by the Controller
under this Act shall be granted by any civil court or
other authority.”
15.    Sub-Section (1) of Section 50 prohibits Civil Courts from
entertaining suits or proceedings insofar as they relate to (i) fixation of
standard rent, or (ii) eviction of a tenant or (iii) any other matter which
16.     Learned Counsel for the petitioners acknowledges the fact that
he does not seek to pigeonhole his objection under either contingency
(i) or (ii), as the suit of the respondents did not seek either fixation of
standard rent or eviction of the petitioners. He, however, invokes
contingency (iii) in Section 50(1). He submits that, as the suit related
to a matter which the Controller was empowered to decide under the
DRC Act, it would not lie before the learned Civil Judge.
17.     To support his stand that the matter to which the suit filed by
the respondents related was one which the Controller was empowered
to decide under the DRC Act, Mr. Mishra relies on Section 44 of the
“44.   Landlords duty to keep the premises in good repair.
(1)    Every landlord shall be bound to keep the
premises in good and tenantable repairs.
(2)    If the landlord neglects or fails to make, within a
reasonable time after notice in writing, any repairs
which he is bound to make under sub-section (1) the
tenant may make the same himself and deduct the
expenses of such repairs from the rent or otherwise
recover them from the landlord:
Provided that the amount sod deducted or recoverable
in any year shall not exceed one-twelfth of the rent
payable by the tenant for that year.
(3)    Where any repairs without which the premises
are not habitable or usable except with undue
inconvenience are to be made and the landlord neglects
or fails to make them after notice in writing, the tenant
may apply to the Controller for permission to make
such repairs himself and may submit to the Controller
an estimate of the cost of such repairs, and, thereupon,
the Controller may, after giving the landlord an
opportunity of being heard and after considering such
estimate of the cost and making such inquires as he
may consider necessary, by an order in writing, permit
the tenant to make such repairs at such cost as may be
specified in the order and it shall thereafter be lawful
for the tenant to make such repairs himself and to
deduct the cost thereof, which shall in no case exceed
the amount so specified, from the rent or otherwise
recover it from the landlord:
Provided that the amount so deducted or recoverable in
any year shall not exceed one-half of the rent payable
by the tenant for that year:
Provided further that if any repairs not covered by the
said amount are necessary in the opinion of the
Controller, and the tenant agrees to bear the excess cost
himself., the Controller may permit the tenant to make
such repairs.”
19.    One may de-construct Section 44 of the DRC Act thus: Sub-
Section (1) of Section 44 binds every landlord to keep the premises in
good and tenantable repairs (sic condition?). If the premises are not
kept in good and tenantable condition by the landlord, the tenant is
entitled, under sub-section (2) to issue a notice, in writing, to the
landlord, to repair the premises. In the event that the landlord fails to
do so within a reasonable time after receipt of such notice, sub-section
(2) empowers the tenant to make the repairs himself and deduct the
expenses of the repairs from the rent payable to the landlord or
recover such expenses from the landlord. Neither sub-section (1) nor
sub-section (2) refers to any exercise of power by the Controller.
20.     Exercise of power by the Controller is, however, envisaged by
sub-section (3) of Section 44.        Where tenanted premises are not
habitable, except by carrying out repairs therein, and, after receipt of
notice to that effect from the tenant, the landlord fails to carry out the
said repairs, Section 44(3) allows the tenant to apply to the Rent
Controller for permission to make such repairs himself. The specific
ingredients which are required to be satisfied before a tenant invokes
the jurisdiction of the Rent Controller under Section 44(3) are,
chronologically, that are that (i) the premises should not be habitable
or usable except by carrying out repairs, (ii) notice in writing has to
be issued by the tenant to the landlord to carry out such repairs, and
(iii) the landlord should neglect or fail to make the repairs despite
receiving such notice.       It is only when these three eventualities,
chronologically and cumulatively are satisfied that the tenant may
approach the Controller. Even then, the power of the Controller is to
permit the tenant to carry out the repairs and submit, to the Controller,
an estimate of the cost of repairs which, after hearing the landlord, the
Controller may call upon the landlord to disgorge.
21.     There is, therefore, no provision in Section 44 of the DRC Act,
or elsewhere in the DRC Act, whereby the Rent Controller can call
upon the landlord to carry out repairs of the tenanted premises. He
may permit the tenant to carry out repairs under Section 44(3) if, after
receipt of notice from the tenant in that regard, the landlord fails to
repair the premises.
22.       Viewed in this background, on a bare perusal of the prayers in
the suit filed by the respondents, it is clear that these prayers could not
be granted by the Rent Controller. The first prayer is for a decree of
permanent injunction in favour of the respondent and against the
plaintiffs, restraining the plaintiffs from interfering in the peaceful
possession and enjoyment of the suit premises by the respondent. The
second prayer is for a decree of mandatory injunction to the landlord
to carry out necessary repairs in the suit premises. As already noticed
hereinabove, the DRC Act does not empower the Rent Controller to
direct the landlord to repair the tenanted premises.             Even, the
alternative prayer B in the suit is for a direction to the landlord to
allow the tenant to repair the suit premises. The Rent Controller is not
empowered under the DRC Act to give any such direction to the
landlord. The remaining prayers in the suit are clearly outside the
jurisdiction of the Rent Controller.
23.       As such, it is clear that the DRC Act does not empower the Rent
Controller to grant any of the prayers in the suit. Applying, therefore,
Section 50 of the DRC Act, it cannot be said that the suit was one
which could be decided by the Rent Controller, so as to oust the
jurisdiction of the Civil Court to adjudicate and decide the lis.
24.       A Coordinate Bench of this Court, of Hon’ble Mr. Justice
Madan B. Lokur (as he then was) has also held, apropos Section 44, in
Yogender Pal Bhatia v. Rajesh @ Sonu 1 thus:
“13. Quite clearly, the provisions of Section 44 of the Act
are applicable only when the landlord neglects to carry out
repairs. However, in the present case, the contention of the
Petitioner is that the Respondents are deliberately causing
damage to the property with an ulterior motive. This, it is
submitted, is not the same as neglecting to repair the tenanted
premises and would, therefore, fall outside the purview of
Sections 44 and 50 of the Act.
14.      The word neglect has been explained in Laxmikant
Revchand         Bhojwani        and      Another v. Pratapsing
Mohansingh Pardeshi , as “to fail to give due care,
attention, or time to. To fail through thoughtlessness or
carelessness. To ignore or disregard.” Neglect along with its
grammatical variation negligence has been explained
in Consumer Unity & Trust Society v. Chairman &
Managing Director, Bank of Baroda 3, 150 in the following
“Negligence is absence of reasonable or prudent care
which a reasonable person is expected to observe in a
given set of circumstances.”
15.      Similarly, in State of Maharashtra v. Kanchanmala
Vijaysing Shirke 4, , it has been stated that negligence is the
omission to do something which a reasonable man is expected
to do or a prudent man is expected to do.
16.      Negligence as a tort has been considered in Poonam
Verma v. Ashwin Patel 5, to involve the following
(a)    A legal duty to exercise due care.
(b)    Breach of duty.
17.      In M.S. Grewal v. Deep Chand Sood 6, negligence in
common parlance has been said to mean and imply failure to
exercise due care expected of a reasonable prudent person.
“It is a breach of duty and negligence in law ranging
from inadvertence to shameful disregard of the safety
of others. In most instances, it is caused by
needlessness or inadvertence, by which the negligent
party is unaware of the results which may follow from
his act.”
In other words, negligence is want of attention and
doing of something which a prudent and reasonable man
would not do.
18.      Consequently, there are two scenarios; on the one hand
there is neglect or negligence on the part of the landlord to
look after the tenanted premises, and on the other, there is a
deliberate act of causing damage to the tenanted premises or
being so totally neglectful in looking after the tenanted
premises as to virtually become a deliberate act of damaging
them.
19.      The allegation of the Petitioner falls in the second
category because it is his case that in spite of knowing fully
well that the tenanted premises require repair, not only are the
Respondents totally neglecting to do anything about it, but are
deliberately damaging the property so as to ensure that the
Petitioner has no option but to vacate the tenanted premises,
which actually suits the interest of the Respondents. To lend
weight to this submission, learned counsel for the Petitioner
has pointed out that the Respondents have carried out
unauthorized construction on the upper floors of the tenanted
premises thereby compounding the problem. It is to show that
the Respondents are carrying out unauthorized construction
that learned counsel for the Petitioner has referred to the order
passed by the Division Bench in LPA No. 326/2001.”
25.   This Court has, therefore, taken a view, in the afore-extracted
paragraphs from Yogender Pal Bhatia1 that Section 44 would not
apply where there is a specific allegation that the landlord has
deliberately caused damage to the suit premises. The assessment of
such a plea, according to this Court, could only be done by a Civil
Court and not by the Rent Controller. Even on that ground, therefore,
the plea of the petitioner that the suit filed by the respondent was not
maintainable before the learned Civil Judge had no merit and could
not, therefore, sustain.
26.    In view of the aforesaid, I do not find that the impugned order
passed by the learned ADJ suffers from any jurisdictional error or is,
even otherwise, legally vulnerable, so as to justify interference under
Article 227 of the Constitution of India.
27.    The petition is accordingly dismissed with no orders as to costs.
Miscellaneous Applications also stand disposed of.
