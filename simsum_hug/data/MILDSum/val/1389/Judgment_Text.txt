1.     The petitioner challenges the order dated 30 th November,
2007 passed by respondent No.2, whereby respondent No.2
confirmed the order dated 3rd September, 2016 passed by
respondent No.1 rejecting the application made by the petitioner
for issuance of caste certificate of her caste to her son.
2.     The petitioner adopted her son Heramb. The petitioner had
filed Misc. Petition No.168 of 2009 in the City Civil Court, Mumbai
seeking permission for adoption of male child from Children of the
Before adopting the male child from the Trust/Orphanage, he was
known as “Pappu”.       Identity of his biological parents was not
known. At the time of the adoption, he was five years old. It is
stated that in terms of the directions issued by the City Civil Court,
Mumbai on 24th December, 2009, the petitioner applied for
registration of birth in the record of the Municipal Corporation. It
was recorded on 13th January, 2010. Birth certificate dated 19 th
January, 2010 came to be issued.
3.     It is the case of the petitioner that she is mother of Heramb,
adoptive son. Her caste is “ Hindu Mahyavanshi” recognized as a
scheduled caste. This caste is recorded in all the documents of her
son Heramb. The petitioner applied for issuance of caste certificate
to respondent No.1. Respondent No.1 vide order dated 3 rd
September, 2016 rejected the said application on the ground that
documents of the caste of father of Heramb were not submitted
and, therefore, the petitioner was not entitled to get a caste
certificate.    The petitioner being aggrieved by the said order,
challenged the same before respondent No.2 – District Caste
vide order dated 30th November, 2017 dismissed the appeal and
confirmed the order passed by respondent No.1.
4.     It is the case of the petitioner that she is a single mother. On
adoption, her son Heramb would take her caste.                Since, he is
adopted from orphanage, there was no question of providing
details of his biological parents. The same are not known even to
the orphanage and ultimately to the petitioner. According to the
petitioner, her son Heramb is entitled to take her caste. Order
rejecting her application for issuance of caste certificate by
respondent No.1 and the confirmation of the said order by
respondent No.2 is illegal.
5.     Nayab Tehsildar has filed an affidavit on behalf of
respondent No.1 and opposed the claim. It is contended that the
petitioner had not submitted permanent residence proof of father/
grandfather/great grandfather of Heramb prior to the deem date
namely 10th August, 1950. The petitioner had not submitted caste
proof of father/grandfather/great grandfather/cousin grandfather
of child Heramb prior to the deem date i.e prior to 10 th August,
1950. These requirements are mandatory. Since the proof of caste
from parental side was not placed on record, the claim was
6.     We have heard Mr. Havnur, learned Counsel for the
petitioner and Ms. Bhende, learned A.G.P, for Respondent-State.
Perused the record and proceeding.
7.     Mr. Havnur, learned Counsel for the petitioner submitted
that the order passed by respondent No.1 and confirmed by
respondent No.2 in the facts situation reflects sheer non
application of mind.     Learned Counsel submitted that all the
documents including the order passed by the City Civil Court,
Mumbai granting permission for adoption from the orphanage
were placed on record. Learned Counsel submitted that since the
petitioner is the single mother, the adopted child was entitled to
take her caste.    In the submission of the learned Counsel, the
reasons recorded for rejection of the application for issuance of
caste certificate by the petitioner are not at all sustainable. In
order to substantiate his submission that in the given set of facts
and circumstances, the child is entitled to take caste of the mother,
the learned Counsel has placed reliance on the decision in the
case of Rameshbhai Dabhai Naika Vs. State of Gujarat and others,
(2012) 3 Supreme Court Cases 425. The learned Counsel
submitted that in view of the ratio laid down in this decision,
orders passed by respondents No.1 and 2 cannot be sustained.
8.     Ms. Bhende, the learned A.G.P supported the findings and
reasons recorded by respondents No.1 and 2 while denying the
claim of the petitioner. The learned A.G.P submitted that in terms
of the Government Resolution dated 1st November, 2001, one of
the mandatory conditions for issuance of caste certificate of
backward class category is that the caste record from father’s side
be produced. The learned A.G.P submitted that in this case since
the caste record on the parental side of Heramb was not produced,
the claim was rightly rejected.
9.    It is to be noted that the son was adopted from an
orphanage namely Children of the World India Trust. Particulars
with regard to the biological father and mother and their caste
were not available with the Orphanage. Similarly, those particulars
could not be provided to the petitioner and as such placed on
record before the City Civil Court. Considering the fact that the
male child was brought up in the Orphanage, it was not a legal
requirement and, therefore, application of the petitioner for
seeking permission to adopt the child was granted.       Copy of the
order passed by the learned Judge of the City Civil Court, Mumbai
was placed on record before respondents No.1 and 2. It has come
on record that in the orphanage, adopted child was known as
“Pappu”.   The petitioner named him as “Heramb”.          The record
reveals that in terms of the directions issued by the City Civil
Court, Mumbai recorded in the order granting permission for
adoption, the petitioner applied to the Municipal Corporation for
registration of birth of Heramb on 13th January, 2010.             It was
registered on 13th January, 2010. His recorded birth date is 8 th
September, 2004 and the petitioner is recorded as his mother.
The petitioner has produced on record the documents to show that
Heramb is her son. It is undisputed that the petitioner is a single
mother. In the backdrop of the above facts, there was no question
of either procurement or production of the documents of the caste
of biological father of the child. Respondents No.1 and 2 have
totally missed this vital aspect in the matter.
10.    It is not out of place to mention that the application for
permission to adopt the child was made by the petitioner as per
the Hindu Adoptions and Maintenance Act, 1956 (for short “Act of
1956”). A perusal of the record shows that on being satisfied that
the petitioner has complied with the requisite conditions for a
valid adoption, the City Civil Court accorded the permission. It is
pertinent to note that as per section 9 of the Act of 1956,
particulars of the person capable of giving child in adoption have
been provided. As per sub-section 4 where the parentage of child
is not known, the guardian of the child may give the child in
adoption with the previous permission of the Court to any person
including the guardian himself. It is, therefore, pertinent to note
that orphanage namely Children of the World India Trust at the
relevant time was the guardian of the child. The inquiry before
granting such permission to a guardian has been contemplated
under sub-section 5 of section 9 of the Act of 1956. The Court
during inquiry is required to be satisfied that the adoption will be
for the welfare of the child and the Court has to give consideration
to the wishes of the child having regard to the age and
understanding of the child. A perusal of the order would show
that the learned Judge of the City Court, Mumbai has recorded
satisfaction that the adoption of child by the petitioner will be for
the welfare of the child.      It is further pertinent to note that
respondents No.1 and 2 have not taken this provision as well as
provision of section 12 of the Act of 1956 into consideration. The
effects of adoption have been provided under section 12. In our
opinion, section 12 would be relevant in the context of the issue
involved in the petition. As per the provisions of section 12 of the
Act of 1956, by a deeming fiction the adopted child becomes a
child of his or her adoptive father, mother for all purposes with
effect from the date of the adoption. The section further provides
that from the date of adoption, all the ties of the child in the family
of his or her birth by a deeming fiction get severed and replaced by
those created by the adoption in the adoptive family.                  It is
pertinent to note that the consequences after adoption flowing
from deeming fiction postulated under section 12 may not be
strictly restricted to the cases only when the child is given in
adoption by father or mother. The same would equally apply
where the child is given in      adoption by guardian in terms of
section 9, sub-section 4 of the Act of 1956.           This analogy is
unavoidable on conjoint reading of section 12 and section 9 sub-
section 4 of the Act of 1956. It is, therefore, seen that on adoption
the child becomes the member of the family of the adoptive
parents in all respect. Such a child would also take the caste of the
adoptive parents. In our opinion, even if the controversy is looked
at from this point of view, it would show that the son of the
petitioner on adoption would be entitled to take her caste. There
was no reason for insisting the petitioner to make the caste record
of his biological parents available inasmuch as the same was not
known and available. In our opinion, this is one more ground to
find fault with the order.
11.   The next important question is whether a child can be
permitted to take the caste of his or her mother. In our opinion,
this position is settled in the case of Rameshbhai Dabhai Naika
(supra). Paragraphs 54 and 55 of this decision are relevant for the
purpose. We propose to reproduce the same. The same read as
“54. In view of the analysis of the earlier
decisions and the discussion made above, the
legal position that seems to emerge is that in
an inter-caste marriage or a marriage between
a tribal and a non-tribal the determination of
the caste of the offspring is essentially a
question of fact to be decided on the basis of
determination of caste of a person born of an
inter-caste marriage or a marriage between a
tribal and a non-tribal cannot be determined in
complete disregard of attending facts of the
case.
55. In an inter- caste marriage or a marriage
between a tribal and a non-tribal there may be
a presumption that the child has the caste of
the father. This presumption may be stronger
in the case where in the inter-caste marriage or
a marriage between a tribal and a non-tribal
the husband belongs to a forward caste. But by
no means the presumption is conclusive or
irrebuttable and it is open to the child of such
marriage to lead evidence to show that he/she
to the Scheduled caste/Scheduled tribe. By
father he did not have any advantageous start
deprivations,   indignities,   humilities      and
community to which his/her mother belonged.
Additionally, that he was always treated a
mother belonged not only by that community
but by people outside the community as well”.
12.    In our view, the proposition would squarely apply to the
facts of the case in hand. We may state that case of the petitioner
is on better footing than the cases of the children born to the
parents in inter-caste marriage or in the marriage between the
triable and non triable. In case of such children, their caste would
at least be known. Here, in this case, caste is not at all known. In
view of the facts and more particularly the fact that child was
adopted from the orphanage with the permission of the Court, the
child would be entitled to take the caste of the mother. In our
view, if analogy applied by respondents No.1 and 2 is sustained
then it would produce disastrous effects. One of the effects would
be that the child would not get identity of mother and particularly
caste of the mother. He would be without identity throughout his
life. Similarly, very purpose of adopting child by the petitioner
being a single mother would stand frustrated. In our opinion, such
a situation could not be envisaged by law.          In our opinion,
respondents No.1 and 2 failed to take note of this fact.            The
unwarranted emphasis on the Government Resolution, in our
opinion, is too far-fetched. In such facts situation, Government
Resolution would not be applicable. In view of the facts and
enunciation of the law by the Supreme Court, we are of the
considered opinion that the petition deserves to be allowed. Son of
the petitioner – Heramb is entitled to take caste of his mother.
