This appeal by the assessee is directed against the order of the ld.
CIT(A), National Faceless Appeal Centre, Delhi [hereinafter referred to as
(NFAC)] dated 25.08.2021 for the AY 2011-12.
2.       The assessee has raised the following grounds:-
“1. On the facts and in the circumstances of the case the learned
CIT(Appeals), National faceless Appeal Centre, grossly erred in
confirming the addition of Rs. 6,33,190/- made by the AO on account of
long term capital gain, arose on sale of immovable property, situated at
Plot No. C-174, RICCO, Housing Colony, Sitapura, Jaipur and
consequently erred in sustaining the order of the Assessing Officer
passed u/s 143(3) 147 of the Act, merely on the technical ground that the
investment was made by the appellant in the purchase of new residential
house property, in the name of his wife Smt. Garima Singh who herself
is a separate assessee and having separate source of income; and thus
denied the benefit of section 54F of the Income-tax Act, 1961.
2. On the facts and in the circumstances of the case the learned
CIT(Appeals), National faceless Appeal Centre, grossly erred in not
properly appreciating the decisions of Hon’ble Rajasthan High Court in
the case of Shri Laxmi Narayan vs. CIT D.B. Income tax appeal no.
20/2016-17-LL-1107-1117 and Mahadev Balai vs. ITO Ward-7(2)
Jaipur-D.B. Income-tax Appeal no. 136/2017 dated 07/11/2017, and
thereby holding that these decisions were of no help to the appellant for
the reason that in these cases the wife was having no separate source of
income.
3. On the facts and in the circumstances of the case the learned
CIT(Appeals), National faceless Appeal Centre, was not correct in
construing the provisions of section 54F and holding that the investment
out of the sale proceeds of the old property required to be made in the
name of assessee himself and not otherwise, despite numerous decisions
of Hon’ble High Courts wherein it has been held that the intent and
purpose with which the section was enacted by the parliament had to be
considered and the interpretation which is not in consonance with the
provisions should be avoided.
4. The appellant craves the right to add, alter or amend any of the
grounds of appeal before the date of hearing.”
3.    Brief facts of the case are that the assessee sold immovable
property situated at Plot no. C-174, RICCO Housing Colony, Sitapura,
Jaipur for sale consideration of Rs.14,75,000/- on 11/10/2010. The
value of which evaluated at Rs.14,79,960/- by the Stamp Duty
Authority. Out of sale consideration of Rs. 14,75,000/- the assessee
made investment of Rs. 7,48,000/- in the purchase of new residential
house property in the name of his wife namely, Smt. Garima Singh,
within the prescribed time limit as prescribed under the provisions of
section 54F of the Act. Accordingly, the assessee claimed exemption
u/s 54F of the Income tax Act. Consequently, no capital gain was
chargeable under the head Long term capital gain on sale of above
immovable property. Despite these facts, the AO while completing
assessment u/s 143(3)/147 of the Act on 08/12/2018 disallowed the
exemption claimed u/s 54F of the Act at Rs. 6,33,190/- and added the
same to the total income of the assessee as long-term capital gain,
holding/observing       that   since the   assessee     made    investment         in
immovable property in the name of his wife and the assessee and his
wife are different persons as well as separate assessee the deduction
claimed u/s 54F of the Act, is not allowable to the assessee.
4.      The AO arrived the findings as held that the assessee did not file her
return of income voluntary as per provision of section 139 of the IT Act, 1961
besides having taxable income for A.Y. 2011-12, therefore, penalty
proceedings u/s 271F of the Income Tax Act, 1961 is hereby initiated. Subject
to above, total income is computed as under:-
On account of long term capital gain as 6,33,190
3.         Total income                                7,98,730
The AO findings are that total income as assessed at Rs. 7,98,730/- u/s 143(3)
read with section 147 of the Income Tax Act, 1961. ITNS-150 showing
calculation of fax and interest chargeable, if any, is attached herewith part of
this order. The penalty proceeding u/s 271F and 271(1)(c) of the IT Act is
hereby initiated.
5.     Being aggrieved by the assessment order, the assessee preferred an
appeal before the ld. CIT(A). Before the ld. CIT(A), the assessee has reiterated
its arguments in para 4 pages 2 to 7 of the order. The ld. CIT(A) for the
reasons stated in his order has rejected the arguments and submissions made by
the assessee.
5.1    The Grounds of Appeal, the facts and circumstances of the case
and the submissions of the appellant have been carefully considered.
Brief facts of the case are that during the period relevant to AY. 2011-
12, the appellant sold immovable property, situated at Plot No.C-174,
RICCO, Housing Colony, Sitapura, Jaipur for sale consideration of
Rs. 14,75,000/- on 11.10.2010. The value of the property was
evaluated Rs. 14,79,960/- by the Stamp Duty Authority. After taking
benefit of Cost acquisition/ improvement, Long term capital gain
worked out at Rs. 6,33,190/-.Thereafter, out of above sale proceeds,
the appellant claimed investment of Rs. 7,48,000/- in purchase of
residential house in the name of his wife namely, Smt Garima Singh,
within the prescribed time limit as required u/s 54F of the Act. The
appellant filed his return of income for the A.Y.2011-12, in
compliance to notice u/s 148 of the Act on 26/04/2018 declaring total
income at Rs.1,65,540/-. Exemption u/s 54F of the Act was claimed
at` Rs. 6,33,190/-in the return of income. The AO completed
assessment u/s 14(3)/147 of the Act on 08/12/2018 determining the
income of the appellant at Rs. 7,98,730/-.While completing the
assessment the AO did not allow exemption claimed u/s 54F of the Act
on the ground that the investment in purchase of immovable property
was made in the name of wife of the appellant, holding, inter-alia,
"the deduction claimed by the assessee u/s 54F of the in the name of
his wife cannot be allowed. It is also mentioned here that the assessee
and his wife are different persons as well as separate assessee.
Therefore, the said deduction is hereby disallowed and added back in
the total income of the assessee on account of Long Term Gain for
this year under the provisions of section 54 F of the income Tax Act,
This resulted in addition of Rs.6,33,190/- on account of Long-term
capital gain.
The appellant has submitted that AO was not justified in disallowing
exemption claimed u/s 54F of the Act as the funds utilized for
purchase of property belonged to the appellant only and merely the
registered document was executed in the name of wife.
5.2 The appellant has placed reliance on the following two case laws
pertaining to the jurisdictional Rajasthan High Court:
1. Decision of Hon'ble Rajasthan High Court (2017) in the case of Shri
Laxmi Narayan vs. Commissioner of Income-tax, Jaipur -D.B. Income
2. Decision of Hon'ble Rajasthan High Court dated 07/11/2017, in the
case of Shri Mahadev Balai Income-tax Officer, War-7(2) Jaipur in
The appellant has contended that though the above cases were decided
by the Hon'bie Rajasthan High Court in relation to section 54B of the
Act, this section is pari material of Section 54F of the Act. Thus, he has
contended that the above caseshave been decided in favor of the
5.3 The contention of the appellant that Section 54B is pari material of
Section 54 of the Act is acceptable. However, a careful perusal of the
case laws pertaining to the jurisdictional Rajasthan High Court relied
upon by the appellant yields the following:
1. Decision of Hon'ble Rajasthan High Court (2017) in the case of Shri
Laxmi Narayan vs. Commissioner of Income-tax, Jaipur -D.B. Income
In the cases decided by this judgment, the facts are that exemption
under Section 54B of the Act was denied without appreciating that the
funds utilized for the investment for purchase of the property eligible
under Section 54B belonged to the appellant only and merely the
registered document was executed in the name of the wife and further,
the wife had no separate source of income. Since in the instant case
under appeal, the wife has separate source of income and is separate
assessee as recorded by the assessing officer in the assessment order,
the facts of the case are distinguishable from the present appeal.
2,      Decision of Hon'ble Rajasthan High Court dated 07/11/2017, in
the case of Shri Mahadev Balai V/s Income-tax Officer, War-7(2),
Jaipur in D.B. Income Tax Appeal No. 136/2017
In the cases decided by this judgment, the facts are that exemption under
Section 54B of the Act was denied without appreciating that the funds
utilized for the investment for purchase of the property eligible
under Section 54B belonged to the appellant only and merely the
registered document was executed in the name of the wife and
further, the wife had no separate source of income. Since in the
instant case under appeal, the wife has separate source of income
and is separate assessee as recorded by the assessing officer in the
assessment order, the facts of the case are distinguishable from the
present appeal.
5.4 Accordingly, the facts in the two cases being distinguishable
from the facts in the appeal at hand; the decisions rendered in the
two case laws pertaining to the jurisdictional Rajasthan High
Court, relied upon by the appellant, cannot come to the rescue of
the appellant.
5.5 On the other hand, it is noted that in the case of Kalya
v.Commissioner of Income-tax, the Hon'ble jurisdictionalRajasthan
High Court [2012] 22 taxmann.com 67 (Raj.) decided that:
...Learned counsel for the appellant canvassed that the object of
granting exemption under Section 54B of the Act of 1961 is that a
person who sells agricultural land for the purpose of purchasing
another agricultural land must be given exemption so far as capital
gains are concerned. The word "assessee" used in section 548 of
the Act for fulfilling the condition and subsequently enabling the
assessee to claim exemption under Section 548 of the Act must be
given a wide and liberal interpretation so as to include his legal
heirs also. The provisions contained in Section 548 of the Act being
socio-welfare and beneficial in nature were required to be
construed liberally in favour of assessee, but the learned Tribunal
arbitrarily disallowed the claim of the appellant-assessee and
upheld the findings of the CIT(A) observing that no deduction
under Section 54B of the Act would be available to the assessee-
appellant on the issue of purchase of land in the name of his son
and daughter-in-law, hence the impugned order needs to be set-
5. Having heard the learned counsel for the appellant and
carefully perused the relevant material on record including the
impugned order. it is noticed that the appellant-assessee sold the
agricultural land, which was mutated in his name, for a sale
consideration of Rs. 1,61,09,100/. Thereafter out of the selling
price, the appellant-assessee purchased land in the name of his
son and daughter-in-law for a total consideration of Rs.
1,22,71,440/-. It is relevant to note that the land sold was in the
name of appellant-assessee, while the land purchased was in the
name of his son and daughter-in-law.
7. A bare reading of Section 54B of the Income Tax Act does not
suggest that assessee would be entitled to get exemption for the
land purchased by him in name of this son and daughter-in-law.
In the facts and circumstances of the case also aforesaid inference
has not been drawn. Same is question of fact. No substantial
question of law arises in appeal. Question whether purchase was by
assessee or by son, is a question of fact.
8. Secondly, the word "assessee" used in the Income Tax Act needs
to be given a 'legal interpretation' and not a 'liberal
interpretation', as contended by the learned counsel for the
appellant. If the word 'assessee' is given a liberal interpretation, it
would be tantamount to giving a free hand to the assessee and his
legal heirs and it shall curtail the revenue of the Government,
which the law does not permit.
9. The Income Tax Appellate Tribunal, having considered all the
facts and circumstances of the case, is found to have rightly
disallowed the exemption under Section 54B of the Act.
10. The impugned order passed by the learned Tribunal is just and
apposite, based on cogent findings, with which we fully concur and
thus, the same warrants no intervention.
11. For the reasons stated above, the income tax appeal fails and the
same being bereft of any merit deserves to be dismissed, which stands
dismissed accordingly."
5.6 In view of this decision of the Hon'ble jurisdictional Rajasthan
High Court, above, the contention of the appellant cannot be
accepted and the case laws cited by the appellant pertaining to
other Hon'ble High Courts cannot come to the rescue of the
appellant. The order of the assessing officer is accordingly,
confirmed.
7. Aggrieved by the CIT(A) order, the assessee is in appeal before us. Before
the CIT (A), the assesee has reiterated that his submissions and which was not
taken on record by the CIT (A). before us the Ld AR for assessee submitted a
detailed Written submissions pages 1 to 5 of Paper Book which are as under :
OFFICER WARD-5(3) JAIPUR- (Earlier Fixed for hearing- 16/12/2021)-
01.     The ground no. 1 of appeal is regarding confirmation of addition of
Rs.6,33,190/-made by the AO on account of Long term capital gain arose on
sale of immovable property , by denying exemption u/s 54F of the Income tax
Act, merely on the ground that the investment in the new residential house
property was made by the appellant in the name of his wife .
Brief facts relating to this ground of appeal are that during the period
relevant to the A.Y. 2011-12, the appellant sold immovable property
situated at Plot no. C-174, RICCO Housing Colony, Sitapura, Jaipur
for sale consideration of Rs.14,75,000/-on 11/10/2010. The value of
which evaluated at Rs.14,79,960/-by the Stamp Duty Authority. Out of
sale consideration of Rs. 14,75,000/-the appellant made investment of
RS.7,48,000/-in the purchase of new residential house property in the
name of his wife namely, Smt. Garima Singh, within the prescribed
time limit as prescribed under the provisions of section 54F of the Act.
Accordingly, the appellant claimed exemption u/s 54F of the Income
tax Act. Consequently, no capital gain was chargeable under the head
Long term capital gain on sale of above immovable property. Despite
these facts, the AO while completing assessment u/s 143(3)/147 of the
Act on 08/12/2018 disallowed the exemption claimed u/s 54F of the
Act at Rs.6,33,190/- and added the same to the total income of the
appellant as long-term capital gain, holding/observing that since the
assessee made investment in immovable property in the name of his
wife and the assessee and his wife are different persons as well as
separate assessee the deduction claimed u/s 54F of the Act, is not
allowable to the assessee.
The AO was not at all justified in rejecting the exemption claimed by the
appellant u/s 54F of the Act at Rs. 6,33,190/-. In support of this following
facts are submitted for your kind
(i)  As per the provisions of section 54F of the Income tax Act, the
purchase of a new residential house has to be purchased by the
assessee. It is not specifically required under the law that a new
residential house property should be purchased in the name of assessee
(ii) The funds utilized in purchase of a new residential house property
belonged to the appellant and there was no contribution from the wife of
the appellant.
Being aggrieved by the order of the AO, the appellant carried the matter
in appeal before the ld. CIT(Appeals)-2 Jaipur, on 04/01/2019. Now, the
ld. CIT(A) National Faceless Appeal Centre Delhi, confirmed the
rejection of exemption u/s 54F of the Act, as made by the AO. It was
submitted before the ld. CIT(A) that investment in the new
residential house property, was made by the appellant in the name
of his wife out of his own funds which were received on sale of
property situated at Plot no. C-174, RICCO Housing Colony
Sitapura Jaipur. Further it was submitted that no contribution was
made by wife of the appellant. Section 54F of the Act, does not
require that the new residential house property should be purchased
in the name of the assessee. It merely says that the assessee should
have purchased/constructed "a residential house". It is also not
necessary to purchase/construct a residential house exclusively in
the name of the assessee. Apart from above facts, the reliance was
placed on the following decisions in which exemption u/s 54/
54F/54B/54EC of the Act has been allowed notwithstanding the fact
that investment in a new residential house was made in the name of
(I)  Decision of Hon'ble Rajasthan High Court Jaipur in the case of Shri
Mahadev Balai Vs ITO Ward-7(2) Jaipur in D.B. Income Tax Appeal No.
136/2017 & others dated 07/11/2017.Wherein in the context of section
54B, it was held that when the investment is made in the name of the wife,
the assessee shall be eligible for claim of deduction u/s 54B of the Act.
(II)       Decision of Hon'ble ITAT Jaipur Bench Jaipur in ITA
No.139/JP/2016, dated 08/12/2017, in the case of Shri Vivek Jain vs DCIT
(III)      Decision of Hon'ble Delhi High Court in the case of CIT- Vs
(IV)       Decision of Hon'ble Delhi High Court in the case of CIT Vs Shri
(V) Decision of Hon'ble Madras High Court in the case of CIT Vs Shri
(VI)       Decision of Hon'ble Punjab & Haryana High Court in the case
(VII)     Decision of Hon'ble Karnataka High Court in the case of DIT
The ld. CIT(A) has not given any heed to the various submission put
forth before him. The decisions of Hon'ble Rajasthan High Court Jaipur
in the case of Shri Mahadev Balai Vs ITO Ward-7(2) Jaipur in D.B.
Income Tax Appeal No. 136/2017 & others, dated 07/11/2017 on which
reliance was placed during the course of appellate proceedings in
support of assessee's claim as mentioned above has not followed by the
ld. CIT(A), holding that the facts of the said case are distinguishable
from the case of the assessee being the wife of the assessee has separate
source of income and separate assessee as recorded by the assessing
officer in the assessment order. Further, the ld. CIT(A), NFAC,
following the decision of Hon'ble Rajasthan High Court in the case of
Shri Kalya Vs CIT (251 CTR 174) has not allowed the exemption claimed
by the assessee u/s 54F of the Act at Rs. 6,33,190/- holding /observing that
the decision of the Hon'ble jurisdictional Rajasthan High Court above, the
contention of the assessee cannot be accepted and the case laws cited by
the appellant pertaining to the other Hon'ble High Courts cannot come to
the rescue of the appellant. The order of the assessing officer is
The above facts clearly indicate that the ld. CIT(A) has grossly erred in
facts and in law in not allowing exemption claimed u/s 54F of the Act. In
support of this following facts are submitted for your kind consideration: -
(i) For denying the exemption u/s 54F of the Act, the ld. CIT(A) has given
his findings/observations that the wife of the assessee is having separate
source of income and is separate assessee as recorded by the assessing
officer in the assessment order. In this regard, it is submitted that
nowhere in the assessment order it has been recorded by the AO that the
assessee has separate source of income. The AO merely mentioned in the
assessment order in Para 4.2 at page no.3 that the assessee and his wife
are different persons as well as separate assessee. Further, it is submitted
that the wife of the appellant was not assessed to tax during the period
relevant to the A.Y. 2011-12. Thus, it is amply clear that the ld. CIT(A)
denied the exemption u/s 54F of the Act on the basis of wrong facts to the
above extent. Further, the Id. CIT(A) has misplaced his reliance on the
judgement of Hon'ble Rajasthan High court in the case of Shri Kalya Vs
CIT (251CTR 174). In this context, it is submitted that the Hon'ble
Rajasthan High court while deciding appeal on the issue of deduction u/s
548 of the Act, in the case of Shri Mahadev Balai Vs ITO in D.B ITA No.
136/2017, dated 07/11/2017 had considered its earlier decision in the
case of Shri Kalya Vs CIT (251CTR 174) and other various decisions of
Hon'ble High courts and held as under: -
"that the- it is the assessee who has to invest and it is not specified in the
legislation that the investment is to be made in the name of the assessee and
where the investment is made in the name of wife, the assessee shall be
eligible for deduction."
The above findings given by the ld. CIT(A) are bad in the eye of law being
not in accordance with the provisions of law and, therefore, the same
deserves to be rejected. In support of this, reliance is placed on the Decision
of Hon'ble ITAT Jaipur Bench Jaipur in ITA No.139/JP/2016, dated
08/12/2017, in the case of Shri Vivek Jain vs DCIT Circle-2 Jaipur-A.Y.
2012-13 (Serial no -2 of Paper Book) which is based on the decision of
Hon'ble Rajasthan High Court Jaipur dated 07/11/2017 in the case of Shri
Mahadev Balai Vs ITO in D.B ITA No. 136/2017. The Hon'ble ITAT Jaipur
held that the assessee is eligible for deduction u/s 54F of the Act in respect of
residential house property purchased in the name of his wife.
In this case the property which was sold, was belonging to the assessee -
Shri Vivek Jain, while the investment in new house property (residential
house) made in the name of Smt. Nikita Jain wife of the assessee. It was
held by the AO that the wife of the assessee is having PAN and filing her
return of income which is also assessed to tax, therefore, as per the
provisions of Income tax Act husband and wife could not be considered as
single entity and the benefit of investment made by an individual assessee
cannot be given to another individual assessee.
Accordingly, it is submitted that the decision of jurisdictional Bench of
Hon'ble Tribunal -ITAT Jaipur Bench Jaipur is clearly applicable in the
case of the appellant and, therefore, exemption claimed by the appellant u/s
54F of the Act, may kindly be allowed.
Apart from above, reliance is placed on the following decisions of the
Hon'ble ITAT Jaipur Bench Jaipur, in support of claim of the appellant u/s
(i)    Hon'ble ITAT Jaipur Bench Jaipur in ITNo.35/JP/2019, dated
12/03/2021, in the case of Shri Dharamveer Singh vs ITO Ward-2(1) Kota -
A.Y. 2012-13. (Serial no.3 of Paper Book) relying on its own decisions in
the case of Shri Mahadev Balai In ITA No 33/JP/2016 dated 24/132/2016
and in ITA no. 139/JP/2016 in the case of Shri Vivek Jain allowed
deduction u/s 54F of the Act in respect of residential house property
purchased in the name of his wife.
(ii) Hon'ble ITAT Jaipur Bench Jaipur in ITA no. 995/JP/2018, dated
31/07/2019, in the case of Shri Ashok Solanki vs ITO-Ward-6(3) Jaipur
allowed exemption u/s 54F of the Act in respect of investment made in
purchase of a residential property in his own name along with the name of
his brother.
(iii) Hon'ble ITAT Jaipur Bench Jaipur in ITA No. 478/JP/2017 dated
19/02/2018, in the case of Smt. Chatru Bai vs ITO-Ward-2(3) Jaipur 2008-
09, allowed the exemption u/s 54B for making investment in a new
agriculture land purchased in the name of sons of the assessee.
(iv) Hon'ble ITAT Jaipur Bench Jaipur(Coordinate Bench) in the
case of Shri Mahadev Balai Vs ITO in ITA no.333/JP/2016 dated
26/12/2016 (Serial no.4 of Paper Book) held that there is no
impediment in the assessee's claim for relief u/s 54F of the Act as the
assessee had purchased the property in the name of his wife.
Further the reliance is placed on the other decisions of Hon'ble High
Courts which are given below: -
(i)    Hon'ble Delhi High Court in the case of CIT-Vs Shri Kamal Wahal
(Delhi HC) (2013) 351 ITR 4, allowed exemption u/s 54F of the Act holding
that the new residential house need not to be purchased by the assessee in
his own name nor it is mandatory that it should be purchased in his name.
(ii) Hon'ble Delhi High Court in the case of CIT Vs Shri Ravindra Kumar
Arora (Delhi) (2012) 342 ITR 38 (Del), allowed the exemption u/s 54F of
the Act observing that it would be treated as the property was purchased by
the assessee in his name and the name of the wife and the property
purchased in the joint names, would not make any difference.
Moreover, section 54F mandates that the house should by purchased
by the assessee and it does not stipulate that the house should be
purchased in the name of assessee only.
(iii) Hon'ble Madras High Court in the case of CIT Vs Shri Natarajan
(2007) 287 ITR 271 (Mad), allowed deduction u/s 54 of the Act in respect of
a residential house property purchased in the name of assessee's wife.
(iv) Hon'ble Punjab & Haryana High Court in the case of CIT Vs Shri
Gurman Singh (2014) 327 ITR 278, allowed deduction u/s 54B of the Act in
respect of another agriculture land purchased in the name of assessee and
his son.
(v) Hon'ble Karnataka High Court in the case of DIT Vs Mrs. Jennifer
Bhide 349 ITR 80, allowed deduction u/s 54 and 54EC of the Act,
holding that where the entire consideration has flown from husband of
the assessee , the assessee cannot be denied the benefit of section 54
and 54EC of the Act, in respect of a residential house property
purchased in the name of assessee's wife.
In the light of above facts and the numerous decisions on which reliance
has been placed in support of claim of the appellant u/s 54F of the Act, it is
submitted that the order of the Id. CIT(A) NFAC, deserves to be reversed.
Accordingly, it is humbly prayed that exemption claimed by the appellant
u/s 54F of the Income tax Act, at Rs.6,33,190/- may kindly be allowed.
02.       The ground no. 2 appeal is related to the ground no.1. The
Id. CIT (A) has grossly erred in not properly appreciating the
decisions of the of Hon'ble Rajasthan High court in the case of Shri
Mahadev Balai Vs ITO Ward-7(2) Jaipur in D.B. ITA No. 136/2017
decision & Other, dated 07/11/2017. In the light of legal proposition
so laid down by the Hon'ble Rajasthan High court in the above case,
where the investment in new house property has flown from the
assessee, which is not in dispute in the case of the assessee. Only,
for the reason that the investment made by the assessee in purchase
of a new residential house in the name of his wife, the same cannot be the
basis for the denial of deduction claimed u/s 54F of Act. Thus, it is
evident that the ld. CIT (A) is not justified in not allowing exemption
claimed u/s 54F of the Act.
03.       The ground no. 3 of appeal is related to the ground no. 1 of
appeal. In the light of above facts exemption u/s 54F, as claimed by the
appellant may kindly be allowed.”
8.     The Ld. DR, on the other hand strongly supporting the order of the
CIT(A) submitted that there is no merit in arguments taken by the Ld. AR
of the assessee and the AO has rightly taken has a fit case for confirming
the addition made by the AO.
9.   We have heard both the parties, perused materials available on record. The
assessee claimed exemption U/s 54F of the Act against the investment of new
residential house in the name of his wife is justifiable . The assesee sold
immovable property for sale consideration of Rs.14,75,000/- on 11-10-
2010.The value of which was estimated at Rs.14,79,960/-by the Stamp
Duty Authority. Out of the         sale consideration of Rs. 14,75,000/- the
assesee made investment of RS.7,48,000/- in the purchase of new
residential house property in the name of his wife namely, Smt. Garima
Singh, within the prescribed time limit as prescribed under the provisions
of section 54F of the Act.
10. Further we observed that the exemption was claimed U/s 54F of the Act
on this account is Rs. 6,33,190/-. It is further noticed that the Assessing Officer
has not disputed the purchase of new house in the name of wife of the assessee
though the claim was denied by the AO . Therefore , the claim of deduction U/s
54F of the Act cannot be denied merely on the ground that the new residential
house was purchased in the name of his wife when the investment made by the
assessee from the sale proceeds of the existing asset and yielded capital gain
from the said transactions.
11. Further we taken into consideration that the Ld AR for the assesse
has placed the reliance on various decisions in which exemption u/s 54/
54F/54B/54EC of the Act has been allowed notwithstanding the fact
that investment in a new residential house was made in the name of
12. Further, we rely on the decision of the Hon’ble jurisdictional High Court
in case of Shri Laxmi Naraya vs. CIT vide decision dated 07.11.2017 in D.B.
Income Tax Appeal No. 20/2016 has considered and decided an identical issue
in paras 7.2 & 7.3 as under:-
“7.2 On the ground of investment made by the assessee in the name of
his wife, in view of the decision of Delhi High Court in Sunbeam Auto
Ltd. and other judgment of different High Courts, the word used is
assessee has to invest it is not specified that it is to be in the name of
assessee.
7.3 It is true that the contentions which have been raised by the
department is that the investment is made by the assessee in his own
name but the legislature while using language has not used specific
language with precision and the second reason is that view has also
been taken by the Delhi High Court that it can be in the name of wife. In
that view of the matter, the contention raised by the assessee is required
to be accepted with regard to Section 54B regarding investment in
tubewell and others. In our considered opinion, for the purpose of
carrying on the agricultural activity, tubewell and other expenses are
for betterment of land and therefore, it will not considered a part of
investment in the land and same is required to be accepted.”
13. The CIT (A) erred in not allowing the exemptions claimed u/s 54F by
following the decision of following the decision of Hon'ble Rajasthan High
Court in the case of Shri Kalya Vs CIT (251 CTR 174) has not allowed the
exemption claimed by the assessee u/s 54F of the Act at Rs. 6,33,190/- holding
/observing that the decision of the Hon'ble jurisdictional Rajasthan High Court
above, the contention of the assessee cannot be accepted. We are of the
considered view that the decision which was cited by the CIT (A) does not
have any relevance with the present case.
14. In considering the above facts and circumstances of the case and taking
into averments made by the Ld AR for assesee and numerous decisions of
various Court and jurisdictional courts. We are allowing the exemption claimed
u/s 54F of the Act. Grounds 1 to 3 of the appeal are related to each other.
Hence all the ground are allowed and set aside the order passed by the NFAC
In the result, the appeal of the assessee is allowed.
Order pronounced in the open Court on 04/05/2022.
