While hearing a plea filed by an 84-year-old man seeking compensation for the loss of his wife and daughter in the 1984 Anti-Sikh Riots, the Allahabad High Court 
has sought a personal affidavit of the Secretary, Home (Communal Control Cell), Government of U.P. 
The bench of Justice 
Mahesh Chandra Tripathi and Justice 
Vivek Kumar Singh passed this order on the plea of one Pyara Singh as it noted that 
the claim of the petitioner is admitted and the matter is pending since 2018. 
Essentially, the wife and daughter of Pyara Singh (who belongs to the Sikh community) were brutally killed in the 1984 riots. Thereafter, in 2006, 
the Ministry of Home Affairs Government of India formulated a policy, which is known as the "Sanction of Rehabilitation Package", as per which, the State Government accorded compensation of Rs.20,000/- to each deceased (Rs.40,000/- to the petitioner).
Now, in the year 2015, 
the State Government enhanced the compensation to the tune of Rs.5 lacs, however, it is the case of the petitioner that the difference in the amount has not been released in favor of the petitioner. Seeking the release of the difference in amount, the petitioner moved to the High court,
Noting that the matter is pending since the year 2018, the High Court has now sought the personal affidavit of the 
Secretary, Home (Communal Control Cell), Government of U.P. on or before the next date of hearing (February 8).
