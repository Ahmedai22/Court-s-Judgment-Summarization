 For Appellant(s)          :    Mr. Kamlakar Sharma (Sr. Advocate)
                                with Mr. Archit Bohra, Ms. Lipi Garg
                                and Ms. Aastha Singhal
 For Respondent(s)         :    Mr. Anil Mehta, AAG with
1.    These appeals arise out of the common judgment of the
learned Single Judge dated 07.01.2022. The appellants-original
petitioners had challenged the action of the municipal authorities
of Kotputli issuing notice dated 14/15.12.2021 and public notice
dated 23.12.2021. By the impugned judgment the learned Single
Judge allowed the petitioners to raise objections to the said
notices upon which the Nagar Palika would decide the objections
by a speaking order within a period of 30 days. Against this
judgment the petitioners have filed these appeals.
2.    Ordinarily since the order passed by the learned Single Judge
does not take away any of the rights of the appellants-petitioners,
we would not have examined these appeals any further. However
learned counsel for the appellants vehemently contended that the
Nagar Palika has issued eviction notices to the occupants of the
area who are occupying these premises on lawful basis since long
                      (Downloaded on 28/02/2022 at 06:49:29 PM)
                                         (4 of 5)             [SAW-341/2022]
and the notice threatens the occupants with demolition if
occupation is not withdrawn voluntarily. On such basis we have
issued notice to Nagar Palika. Mr. Anil Mehta, AAG appearing for
the Nagar Palika stated that the Nagar Palika intends to widen the
road. He submitted that some of the occupants have caused
encroachments. Accordingly notices dated 14/15.12.2021 were
issued. He further brought to our notice that under a general
public notice dated 23.12.2021 the Nagar Palika asked all the
occupants within the road land to remove their structures failing
which there would be a demolition. He could not controvert the
averments of the appellants-petitioners that no procedure for
acquisition on private lands has been undertaken by Nagar Palika.
3.     Under the circumstances we are of the opinion that those
petitioners-occupants to whom the notice dated 14/15.12.2021 or
such similar notices have been served, they must file their replies.
If according to them they have not encroached on any part of the
private land it would be open for them to point out the same to
the authorities. However the public notice dated 23.12.2021 is bad
in law and requires all and sundry to withdraw the occupation
failing which there would be demolition of structures. This does
not make a distinction between a person who has caused
encroachment and why he was occupying the premises in unlawful
terms. Counsel for the Nagar Palika agreed that no proceedings
for acquiring such private properties either through private
negotiations or compulsory acquisition has been undertaken. The
municipality cannot demolish such structures.
4.     Under these circumstances appeals are disposed of with
following directions:-
                    (Downloaded on 28/02/2022 at 06:49:29 PM)
                                                                            (5 of 5)                   [SAW-341/2022]
                                           1. Any of the appellants-original petitioners who
                                           may    have    received        the       said      notice  dated
                                           14/15.12.2021 may file objections before the
                                           authorities. If no objection is raised, the same be
                                           done within a period of 30 days from today. The
                                           objection which have already been received or
                                           those may be received 30 days thereafter be
                                           disposed of by the authorities by a speaking order
                                           as desired by the learned Single Judge.
                                           2. Public notice dated 23.12.2021 is quashed.
                                 5.     Learned     counsel     for     the       appellants       submitted     that
                                 subsequently the municipality has amended Rajasthan Municipality
                                 Act, 2009 and inserted Section 73B therein. Since these are
                                 developments which took place after the disposal of the writ
                                 petitions and since Section 73B of the Act is not under challenge,
                                 the course of these appeals would not change on account of these
                                 developments. It is always open for the appellants to take
                                 recourse of appropriate remedy if fresh cause of action has arisen.
                                                       (Downloaded on 28/02/2022 at 06:49:29 PM)
