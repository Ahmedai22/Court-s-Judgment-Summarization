The Kerala High Court on Wednesday recognised the efforts being made by magician Gopinath Muthukad for upliftment of the differently-abled children, and asked the Registrar General to convey the appreciation of court to Muthukad and the entire team of Different Art Centre (DAC).
The court appreciated the famous magician in its decision on a petition challenging the exclusion of 'mentally retarded persons' from the government notification that grants exemption from taxation for motor cars of physically handicapped persons.
Justice P.V. Kunhikrishnan directed the Registrar General of the Court to send a recognition certificate to Muthukad and his team for their efforts. 
"He is conducting a centre for differently abled children at Kazhakootam, Thiruvananthapuram which is known by the name, “Different Art Centre”. More than 100 differently abled children are there in this centre. Their talents are great. A person visiting the Different Art Centre will understand that we are nothing in front of those differently abled children. They sing, dance, play drums and perform magic for us," said the court.
Noting that nowadays physically handicapped persons including mentally retarded persons are usually called 'differently abled persons' or ‘specially abled', Justice Kunhikrishnan said in his opinion, a majority of the citizens in this country have some disability when compared to the minority. 
"Every human being is having incapacities either mentally or physically or talent-wise. Every citizen is having inborn talents in one way or another way. That is why physically handicapped persons including mentally retarded persons are called 'differently/specially abled persons'. Why do we treat them separately and watch them with sympathetic eyes? When we appreciate the talented minority among us, why not appreciate these categories of our citizens who are 'differently/specially abled persons'? They are not different, but one among us. Their parents need not worry about the society because they are one among the citizens. Parents of these 'differently/specially abled persons' need not be anxious as the state will protect their interest, and their fellow citizens will keep them close," the bench said.
It further observed that some of the differently or specially-abled persons will write stories, some of them will write poetry and some of them will sing and dance. "We should not exclude them from the general category and as they are also differently abled persons. They are a part of our society. Just like the lack of inborn talents in some citizens, a differently abled person also has some disability, but they have better abilities than others in some other field," it added.
The court said citizens of this Country should visit differently/specially abled children when they get an opportunity, not to sympathize with them but to love them and to interact with them.
It is in this context that the Court appreciated the efforts of Muthukad and the Different Art Centre run by him which has more than 100 differently abled children, some of whom are exceptionally gifted in their own ways. 
"The Registrar General will convey the appreciation of this Court to Mr.Gopinath Muthukad and the entire team of Different Art Centre (DAC) along with a copy of this judgment in the light of the observations of this Court in paragraph-15 of this judgment," Justice Kunhikrishnan said in the order.
The petitioner in this case was represented by Advocates Varghese Parambil, Albert Joseph, P. Chandy Joseph, and T.K. Kunjumon. Government Pleader Reshmitha R appeared on behalf of the respondents.
