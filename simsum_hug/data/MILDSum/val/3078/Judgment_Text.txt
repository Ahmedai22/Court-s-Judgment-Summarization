The point to be decided in this case is whether the exclusion
of ‘mentally retarded persons’ from the category of ‘physically
handicapped persons’ in Ext.P3 notification issued by the Government
by invoking the powers under Sec.22 of the Kerala Motor Vehicles
Taxation Act, 1976 (for short the, “Act,1976”) is discriminatory or not.
2.        The short facts narrated in the writ petition are as
follows: The petitioner is a mentally retarded person and the writ
petition is filed through his guardian, his mother. A perusal of Ext.P1,
the Standing Disability Assessment Board Certificate issued by the
competent authority, will show that the petitioner is having mental
retardation (moderate) and his permanent disability was assessed as
75%. It is stated in the writ petition that the petitioner is fond of
outings apart from that, if he is kept in the house itself, he often
becomes       restless  and    his   behaviour    sometimes    becomes
unpredictable. However, at the same time, it is very difficult for him
to travel in the public transport system because of his physical
disabilities. So, in order to integrate with the society, the parents of
the petitioner thought of purchasing a motor car for his travel.
Accordingly, a motor car was purchased in the name of the petitioner
for his own use. It is the case of the petitioner that the 2 nd
respondent, The Transport Commissioner, insisted on the payment of
one-time tax to the vehicle and hence, he was forced to pay the one-
time tax as evidenced by Ext.P2 receipt. According to Ext.P3
notification, issued as per Sec.22 of the Act,1976, the payment of tax
is exempted to - three wheelers, invalid carriages, motor cycles and
motor cars which are owned by physically handicapped persons for
their own use whether driven by the handicapped persons themselves
or by others for the transport of such handicapped persons subject to
the production of a certificate from the medical officer not below the
rank of a civil surgeon that the owner of the vehicle is a physically
handicapped person with more than 40% disability at least. For the
purpose of the notification, the physically handicapped persons are
explained as blind, deaf and orthopeodically handicapped persons.
Ext.P3 is the notification. Based on Ext.P3 notification, the petitioner
claimed the refund of Rs.40,570/- paid by him as vehicle tax. But the
2nd respondent disallowed the exemption by stating that as per Ext.P3
notification, the petitioner is not entitled to the benefit because
mentally retarded persons are not included in the explanation
mentioned as physically handicapped persons in Ext.P3 notification.
According to the petitioner, rejection of the prayer for the refund of
the tax amount of Rs.40,570/- paid by the petitioner is blatantly
discriminatory and violates the fundamental right under Article 14 of
the Constitution of India. It is also submitted that as per Ext.P5
notification, the charitable organisation exclusively used for the
conveyance of mentally retarded/physically handicapped/deaf and
dump children, inmates of orphanages and old age homes etc. are
given a deduction in motor vehicles tax. Hence it is submitted that the
petitioner, who is a mentally retarded person, is entitled to tax
exemption. Hence, the above writ petition is filed with the following
i.      Call for the records relating to the case and to declare that the
non inclusion of the mentally retarded persons in the Ext.P3 is
discrimination and is in violation of the Article 14 of the
constitution of India.
ii.     Issue Writ in the nature of mandamus or such other appropriate
writ or order or direction commanding the respondents to
refund of Rs.40,570 paid as per Ext.P2 by way of Motor Vehicle
Tax to the petitioner.
iii.    To grant such other reliefs that are found just and proper to be
granted in the facts and circumstances of the case or as may be
prayed for during the course of above petition.
3.        The 1st respondent filed a counter affidavit, in which it
is stated that as per the existing definition of the term 'physically
handicapped',       vide    SRO     No.301/98,     mental    retardation    is not
considered as a physical handicap and hence, the petitioner is not
entitled to the benefit of exemption from the payment of motor
vehicles tax. It is also stated in the affidavit that the hardship
encountered in parenting a differently abled child is not disputed. But,
according to the 1st respondent, The Taxation Authority, the 2nd
respondent, The Transport Commissioner is bound by the prevailing
rules and laws and thus the rejection of the prayer of the petitioner
for exemption from tax is justified. It is stated in the counter affidavit
that the 2nd respondent is not a competent authority to overrule the
existing provisions and hence, there is no need         to interfere with
Ext.P4 order.
4.       A counter affidavit is filed by the 2nd respondent also.
Almost similar contentions raised in the counter affidavit filed by the
1st respondent are reiterated in the counter filed by the 2 nd
respondent. It is also stated that there are several other matters
which should be addressed before taking a decision on these types of
matters. It is also stated that it is a moot question to ask, whether a
mentally challenged person can act on his own and own up to his
responsibilities and questions relating to insurance coverage and
third-party claims. According to the 2nd respondent, it requires serious
consideration by the legislature. It is also stated that the mentally
challenged persons are a distinct category from the physically
challenged persons because the physically challenged are capable of
owning criminal and civil liabilities, whereas the mentally challenged
cannot have mensrea or civil liability. Therefore, it is stated by the 2 nd
respondent in the counter affidavit that this is a matter having serious
legal consequences and that the third party claims would get
frustrated. But, the 2nd respondent submitted that the matter is under
the consideration of the State Government, and without amendment
of the law, no relief can be granted in this case. It is also stated that
the welfare measures initiated by the Government have been widely
misused nowadays. It is further stated that the vehicles are registered
in the name of physically handicapped persons, just for the purpose of
evading tax, and thereafter the same is used for other purposes.
Hence the Department is highly apprehensive about the extension of
such benefits as this would seriously harm the revenue interest of the
State is the further contention raised in the counter affidavit.
5.      Heard the learned counsel for the petitioner and the
6.      The learned counsel for the petitioner reiterated the
contentions raised in the writ petition. The counsel submitted that the
exclusion of mentally retarded persons from the explanation of
physically handicapped persons in Ext.P3 is discriminatory and
arbitrary. According to the counsel, the exclusion of mentally retarded
persons from the category of physically handicapped persons is an
injustice and is an improper classification. It is also contended by the
petitioner that, subsequent to Ext.P3 notification, the Government
issued G.O.(P).No.13/2022/TRANS dated 26.04.2022 in which the
Government exempted tax for the motor cars having purchase value
up to Rs.7,00,000/-, which are owned by persons with autism or
cerebral palsy or multiple disability or mental retardation, subject to
certain conditions. Therefore, there is no justification for denying the
tax exemption to the petitioner who purchased the vehicle before the
above Government Order is the submission.
Pleader on the other hand submitted that the powers of the
Government to exempt tax as per section 22 of the Act,1976             is
discretionary in nature. The Government exercised that discretion and
gave a concession to certain categories. Under such a situation, this
Court may not interfere with such concession granted by the
Government. The Government Pleader also submitted that after a
detailed study, the Government felt that the concession granted to
physically handicapped persons should be enlarged further, and
accordingly, tax exemption is granted for motor cars owned by a
person with autism or cerebral palsy or multiple disability or mental
retardation with effect from 01.03.2022. The petitioner purchased the
car before 01.03.2022 and therefore, the petitioner is not entitled to
the tax exemption. It is the specific contention of the Government
Pleader that there is no application of Article 14 of the Constitution in
a concession given by the Government. The learned Government
Pleader conceded the hardship encountered in parenting a differently
abled child but, the Government Pleader submitted that the 2 nd
respondent is bound by the orders that are in existence as on the
date of purchase of the motor car by the petitioner, and hence, the
rejection of the claim for tax exemption is justified.
8.       The point to be decided in this case is whether the
mentally retarded persons are also entitled for tax exemption while
purchasing motor cars in the light of the fact that physically
handicapped persons were given such an exemption as per Ext.P3
order. As per Section 22 of the Act, 1976, the Government may, if
they are satisfied that it is necessary in the public interest so to do,
by notification in the Gazette make an exemption or reduction in the
rate or other modification either prospectively or retrospectively; in
regard to the tax payable under this Act or under the Kerala Motor
Vehicles Taxation Act, 1963 or the Kerala Motor Vehicles (Taxation of
Passengers and Goods) Act, 1963: by any person or class of persons;
or in respect of any motor vehicle or class of motor vehicles; or in
respect of any motor vehicle or class of motor vehicles using a
specified route, subject to such terms and conditions as they may
deem fit.
9.      Ext.P3 is a notification issued in exercise of the
powers under Section 22 of the Act,1976 by the Government of
Kerala. As per Ext.P3, the Government has exempted three wheelers,
invalid carriages, motor cycles and motor cars which are owned by
the physically handicapped persons for their own use whether driven
by the handicapped persons themselves or by others for the transport
of such handicapped persons, from the tax payable under the
Act,1976 from the 1st day of April, 1998 permanently subject to the
production of a certificate from a medical officer not below the rank of
a civil surgeon that the owner of the vehicle is a physically
handicapped person with more than 40% disability at least.                    The
explanation to the notification states that, for the purpose of the
notification, physically handicapped persons means, the blind, the
deaf and the orthopeodically handicapped. It will be better to extract
the explanation to the notification hereunder:
“Explanation:-    For   the  purpose     of this  notification physically
handicapped persons means:
(a) The blind - That is those persons who suffer from any of the
(1) total absence of sight,
(2) visual acuity not exceeding 6/60 or 20/200 (snellen) in the better
eye with correcting lense.
(3) Limitation of the field of vision substanding an angle of 20 Degrees
(b) The Deaf:- That is those persons in whom the sense of hearing is
non functional for the ordinary purpose of life. Generally a lose of
hearing at 70 decibels or above at 500, 1000 or 2000 frequencies will
make residual hearing non-functional.
(c) The Orthopeodically handicapped:- That is those persons who have a
physical defect or deformity which caused an interference with the
normal functioning of born muscles and joints. (Notification GO.(MS)
10.        From the above explanation, it is clear that the tax
exemption available as per Exhibit P3 is only to the blind, the deaf
and orthopeodically handicapped.
11.        Subsequently,     as    per   G.O.(P).No.13/2022/TRANS
dated 26.04.2022,        the tax exemption is granted to the motor cars
having purchase value up to 7 lakhs which are owned by persons with
autism or cerebral palsy or multiple disabilities or mental retardation
with effect from 01.03.2022.             It will be better to extract G.O.
(P).No.13/2022/TRANS dated 26.04.2022:
In exercise of the powers conferred by section 22 of the Kerala
Motor Vehicles Taxation Act, 1976 (19 of 1976), the Government of
Kerala, being satisfied that it is necessary in the public interest so to
do, hereby exempt the motor cars having purchase value up to Rs. 7
lakh which are owned by persons with autism or cerebral palsy or
Multiple Disabilities or Mental Retardation from the tax payable under
the said Act, from 1 March, 2022, permanently, subject to the
following conditions, namely:-
(i) the vehicle shall be used for the transportation of such persons as
(ii) the owner of the vehicle shall be eligible for tax exemption for only
(iii) a certificate issued by a Medical Board in Government sector to
the effect that the owner of the vehicle is suffering from autism or
cerebral palsy or Multiple Disabilities or Mental Retardation having not
less than 40% disability, shall be produced.
(This does not form part of the notification, but is intended to
indicate its general purport.)
As per notification issued under G.O.(Ms) No.16/98/Tran. dated 31 st
March, 1998 and published as S.R.O. No. 301/98 in the Kerala Gazette
Extraordinary No. 546 dated 31 st March, 1998, Government have
exempted three wheelers, invalid carriages, motor cycles and motor
cars owned by the physically handicapped persons from payment of
tax under the Kerala Motor Vehicles Taxation Act, 1976 (19 of 1976).
Considering the representations received from the parents of mentally
challenged persons, requesting to exempt the tax under the Kerala
Motor Vehicles Taxation Act, 1976 (19 of 1976) in respect of the
vehicles registered in the names of such persons and used for the
transportation of such persons, Government have decided to exempt
the motor cars having purchase value up to Rs.7 lakh which are owned
by persons with autism or cerebral palsy or Multiple Disabilities or
Mental Retardation from the tax payable under the said Act subject to
the production of a certificate issued by a Medical Board in
Government sector to the effect that the owner of the vehicle is having
not less than 40% disability.
The notification is intended to achieve the above object.”
12.       From a reading of the above Government Order
including the explanatory note, it is clear that the Government
extended tax exemption to persons with autism or cerebral palsy or
multiple disabilities or mental retardation. Ext.P3 order is referred to
in the explanatory note of the above Government Order dated
26.04.2022.        It is stated that the tax exemption is enlarged to
persons with autism or cerebral palsy or multiple disabilities or mental
retardation because of the representation received from the parents
of such persons.        But as per the above Government Order dated
26.04.2022, the tax exemption is available only to the persons who
have    purchased     the   motor    cars   from  01.03.2022    onwards.
Admittedly, the petitioner who purchased the motor car is not entitled
to the benefit of G.O.(P)No.13/2022/TRANS dated 26.04.2022,
because he purchased the vehicle before the above Government order
but after Ext P3 order. Therefore, this Court has to decide whether
the exclusion of mentally retarded persons from the explanation to
Ext.P3 Government Order is discriminatory or not.
13.     Nowadays physically handicapped persons including
mentally retarded persons are usually called or termed as, 'differently
abled persons' or ‘specially abled children’.       Why are they called
'differently abled' or ‘specially abled’? In my opinion, a majority of the
citizens in this country have some disability when compared to the
minority.     Some citizens may sing beautifully like the legends
K.J.Yesudas or Lata Mangeshkar even without any training or
coaching. That is their inborn talent. We can see such people in our
villages, schools, colleges and even on the streets. But majority of the
citizens may not have such an ability. Similarly, some persons may
dance without coaching or training, like Mrinalini Vikram Sarabhai or
Dhananjayan Mash who are some of the stalwarts in this field. They
just watch the dance performance of the legends and dance like
them. The majority of the citizens may not be able to do so because
there is no such inbuilt talent in them. Similarly, there are be orators
in the villages of this Country, who may not have any basic education
but, they speak like the great orator, Sukumar Azhikode. The majority
of the citizens may not have such an ability. Similar is the situation in
acting, writing, poetry writing and even in the fields of athletics,
football, volleyball, etc. A section of people may have inborn talent
and they will perform without any training or coaching and the others
may not have such an inborn talent. A coconut climber can be seen in
almost all villages in our state and he can climb on coconut trees with
ease. But the majority of the people are not able to climb like that
because there is no such talent for them. Moreover, we all have heard
about the talent of 'Ekalavya'(a character in the great Indian epic
Mahabharatha) who studied archery without the aid of any 'gurus' but
treated 'Dronacharya' as his Guru in his mind. Therefore, a minority of
citizens are ‘differently abled persons' or ‘specially abled persons’
when compared to the majority of the citizens. Under such a situation
also the minority can be called 'differently abled persons' or 'specially
abled persons’. Therefore, none of us need to boast that, we are
something great when compared to others. Every human being is
having incapacities either mentally or physically or talent-wise. Every
citizen is having inborn talents in one way or another way.       That is
why physically handicapped persons including mentally retarded
persons are called 'differently/specially abled persons'. Why do we
treat them separately and watch them with sympathetic eyes? When
we appreciate the talented minority among us, why not appreciate
these categories of our citizens who are 'differently/specially abled
persons'? They are not different, but one among us. Their parents
need not worry about the society because they are one among the
citizens. Parents of these 'differently/specially abled persons' need not
be anxious as the state will protect their interest, and their fellow
citizens will keep them close. Some of these differently/specially-
abled persons will write stories, some of them will write poetry and
some of them will sing and dance. We should not exclude them from
the general category and as they are also differently abled persons.
They are a part of our society. Just like the lack of inborn talents in
some citizens, a differently abled person also has some disability, but
they have better abilities than others in some other field.
14.      'Ashtavakra' a vedic sage in Hinduism born with eight
deformities, is the author of 'Ashtavakra Gita' which examines the
metaphysical nature of existence and the meaning of individual
freedom and also presents its thesis that there is only one supreme
reality. Stephen Hawking, an English theoretical physicist has some
physical disabilities, but he is the author of several books and was one
of the most renowned person in the world. Therefore, respecting the
differently/specially abled person is the duty of every citizen.    They
don't want sympathy from the citizens. They want recognition from
the citizens.    Citizens need not treat them as physically disabled
persons. But the citizens should treat them as differently/specially-
abled persons. Respecting them and treating them as equals is the
duty of every citizen of this country. The Holy Quran urges to treat
people with intellectual disabilities with kindness and urges to protect
them. The prophet Muhammad is shown to have treated disabled
persons with respect. Not only in Islam, but all religions recognizes
the same, and therefore it is the duty of the citizens to respect the
differently abled persons and not to watch them with sympathetic
eyes. They are similar to us. Some of us may have some abilities
likewise they are also have abilities that we do not have.
15.     in my opinion, the citizens of this Country should visit
differently/specially abled children when they get an opportunity, not
to sympathize with them but to love them and to interact with them.
At this juncture, this Court has to recognize the efforts of Mr.Gopinath
Muthukad,      a    famous     magician,     for   the   upliftment    of
differently/specially abled children. He is conducting a centre for
differently abled children at Kazhakootam, Thiruvananthapuram which
is known by the name, “Different Art Centre”. More than 100
differently abled children are there in this centre.    Their talents are
great. A person visiting the Different Art Centre will understand that
we are nothing in front of those differently abled children. They sing,
dance, play drums and perform magic for us. The performance of
these students are available online (www.differentartcentre.com). The
great ability of one boy by the name, Varun Ravindran in this centre is
thrilling and unimaginable. He can read and write several languages
without the help of a teacher. He can read and write Bengali, Telugu,
Kannada, English etc. He studied these languages without any serious
coaching or training. The experts in the field says that it is a special
ability of this person. We can also see a boy named Sreekanth in the
Different Art Centre who sings beautifully with a smile on his face
along with the rhythm played by another boy named Kashi.            The
perfection of Sreekanth in singing the famous Malayalam movie song
"Rama Katha ganalayam..."(Movie-Bharatham) cannot be described in
words. These are only some examples. Differently abled children are
enjoying themselves under the wings of Mr.Gopinath Muthukad and
his dedicated staffs.   It is the duty of this Court to appreciate such
dedicated persons. The Registrar General of this court will send a
recognition certificate to Mr.Gopinath Muthukad and his entire team
for their valuable efforts taken to help the differently/specially abled
16.    The question to be decided in this case is whether
mentally retarded persons are entitled to tax exemption while
purchasing a motor car.       As per Ext.P3 notification, physically
handicapped persons are entitled to tax exemption with effect from
01.04.1998. But the explanation of "physically handicapped persons"
in Ext.P3 Government Order is confined to the blind, the deaf and the
orthopeodically handicapped persons. A mentally retarded person is
not included. The petitioner is a mentally retarded person with 75%
disability. Such category of persons was not given tax exemption.
Ext.P3 notification clearly says that the physically handicapped
persons for their own use, whether driven by the handicapped
persons    themselves  or  by   others   for the   transport  of   such
handicapped persons are entitled to tax exemption.       Therefore, the
contention of respondents 1 and 2 that simply because a mentally
retarded person cannot own the responsibilities and questions relating
to insurance coverage and third-party claims, the tax exemption can
not be enlarged to them, is not justified. The plight of the parents of
the differently abled person is to be considered at this point of time.
Some of the parents may have to take their children to school or
other places. Under such a situation, a vehicle may be a dream to
them. The suffering and insult suffered by some of the parents cannot
be ignored. As I said earlier, this is a country in which every citizen
has some disability.      There is no difference between a normal man
and an abnormal man. Even a normal man, has some disabilities.
Likewise, an abnormal man, has abilities too.        We should recognize
those abilities.
17.      What is the basis for giving an explanation in Ext P3
and limiting physically handicapped persons only to the category of
blind, deaf and orthopedic persons? In my opinion, there is no basis
for excluding mentally retarded persons from the category of
physically handicapped persons.
18.      The    Black’s  Law   Dictionary  defines    “child   with
disabilities” like this: “Under the Individuals with Disabilities Education
Act, a child who needs special-education or related service because of
(1)   mental      retardation,    (2)  a   hearing,  language     or   visual
impairment, (3) a serious emotional disturbance or (4) another health
impairment or specific learning disability”. Article 1 of United Nations
Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities states that
persons with disabilities include those who have long-term physical,
mental, intellectual or sensory impairments which in interaction
with various barriers may hinder their full and effective participation
in society on an equal basis with others. Section 2(i) of The persons
with Disabilities (Equal Opportunities, Protection of Rights and Full
Participation) Act, 1995 (in short the, “Act,1995”), defines “disability”
as   “blindness,   low   vision, leprosy-cured,   hearing   impairment,
locomotor    disability, mental    retardation,    and   mental  illness.
Similarly, the Rights of Persons With Disabilities Act, 2016 (for short
the, “Act,2016”) defines "person with a disability" in Section 2(s) as a
person with long term physical, mental, intellectual or sensory
impairment which, in interaction with barriers, hinders his full and
effective participation in society equally with others. The       United
Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities is the
basis for the enactment of the Act,2016. As per the United Nations
Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, Act 1995 and
also as per the Act,2016, the person with disability includes a
mentally retarded person. Under such circumstances, I am of the
considered opinion that the exclusion of mentally retarded persons in
the   explanation      of   physically    handicapped       persons    in    Ext.P3
notification is a clear case of discrimination. The Apex Court, in Deaf
Employees Welfare Association and Another v. Union of India
and Others [2014 (3) SCC 173], considered the comparison of
disabilities among persons with disabilities. The Apex Court observed
that the person suffering from hearing impairment is equal to blinds
and orthopeodically handicapped persons.                It will be beneficial to
extract paragraphs 23, 25, 26 and 28 of the above judgment
“23.     The Disabilities Act, as already indicated, states that
the "persons with disabilities" means persons suffering from not
less than 40% of "any disability, as certified by the medical doctor.
When a person is having any of the disabilities mentioned in S.2(i)
and is so certified by the Medical Doctor, he is entitled to the
benefits of all the Schemes and benefits provided by the
Government and there can be no further discrimination among the
persons with varied or different types of disabilities. In the matter
of affirmative action, in our view, there cannot be further
discrimination between a person with disability of 'blindness' and a
person with disability of hearing impairment. Such discrimination
has not been envisaged under the Disabilities Act. All the categories
of persons mentioned in S.2(i) have their own disadvantages,
peculiar to themselves. A ‘visually impaired person’ cannot be
equated with 'hearing impaired person' and vice versa. Both have
different type and mode of disability. For a blind person, visibility
may be poor, sometimes zero per cent, but would be able to hear
and understand what is going on in and around him. At the same
time, a deaf and dumb person could see, but would not be able to
talk and hear what is going on around him. The nature of disability
of those categories of persons may not be same, but the disabilities
they suffer are to be addressed with care and compassion.
25.           The hearing impaired person also would not be able to
hear the sound of horn and passing vehicles and, at times, will have
to seek the assistance of other co-passengers or strangers on the
road. We find it difficult to subscribe the view that disability, as
envisaged under S.2(a) of the Act, with respect to the hearing
impaired persons, is less than the disability of a blind person. No
such discrimination has ever been made or visualized among the
persons with disabilities mentioned in S.2(i) of the Act as they form
a class by themselves. A further discrimination amongst themselves
is clearly violative of Art. 14 of the Constitution of India.
26.           The Disabilities Act deals with a well defined class i.e.
"persons with disabilities” mentioned in S.2(i). The nature of
disability may differ from person to person included in S.2(i), but all
such persons have been categorized as a group of "persons with
disabilities" under S.2(i) read with S.2(t) of the Act. In our view, the
differentia sought to be canvassed by the Ministry of Finance has no
rational relation to the object sought to be achieved by the
Disabilities Act, which envisages to give equal opportunities,
protection and rights to the "persons with disabilities". Equality of
law and equal protection of law be afforded to all the "persons with
disabilities" while participating in Governmental functions. Transport
allowance is given to Government employees since many of the
Government employees may not be residing in and around their
places of work. Sometimes, they have to commute long distances to
and fro. There has been an unprecedented increase in the
commutation time between the residence and place of work which
effects the work environment in offices adversely as the employee
spend much of their energy in commuting and, in the case of
persons with disabilities, the situation is more grave.
28.       The deaf and dumb persons have an inherent dignity
and the right to have their dignity respected and protected is the
obligation of the State. Human dignity of a deaf and dumb person is
harmed when he is being marginalized, ignored or devalued on the
ground that the disability that he suffers is less than a visually
impaired person which, in our view, clearly violates Art.21 of the
Constitution of India. Comparison of disabilities among “persons of
disabilities”, without any rational basis, is clearly violative of Art. 14
of the Constitution of India. In our view, the recommendation made
by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare for extending the
benefit of transport allowance to the Government employees
suffering from hearing impairment in equal with blinds and
orthopaedically handicapped Government employees is perfectly
legal and is in consonance with Art.14 and Art.21 of the Constitution
of India." (Underline supplied)
19.       Similarly, in Vikash Kumar v. Union Public Service
Commission and Others [2021 (5) SCC 370], the Apex Court
considered the provision for the facility of a scribe for a person with
disabilities.    While considering the same, the Apex Court considered
the matter in detail in paragraphs 41 and 42, which are extracted
“41.      When the government in recognition of its affirmative
duties and obligations under the RPwD Act 2016 makes provisions for
facilitating a scribe during the course of the Civil Services
Examination, it cannot be construed to confer a largesse. Nor does it
by allowing a scribe confer a privilege on a candidate. The provision
for the facility of a scribe is in pursuance of the statutory mandate to
ensure that persons with disabilities are able to live a life of equality
and dignity based on respect in society for their bodily and mental
integrity. There is a fundamental fallacy on the part of the
UPSE/DoPT in proceeding on the basis that the facility of a scribe
shall be made available only to persons with benchmark disabilities.
This is occasioned by the failure of the MSJE to clarify their
guidelines. The whole concept of a benchmark disability within the
meaning of Section 2(r) is primarily in the context of special
provisions including reservation that are embodied in Chapter VI of
the RPwD Act 2016. Conceivably, the Parliament while mandating the
reservation of posts in government establishments and of seats in
institutions of higher learning was of the view that this entitlement
should be recognized for persons with benchmark disabilities. As a
matter of legislative policy, these provisions in Chapter VI have been
made applicable to those with benchmark disabilities where a higher
threshold of disability is stipulated. Except in the specific statutory
context where the norm of benchmark disability has been applied, it
would be plainly contrary to both the text and intent of the
enactment to deny the rights and entitlements which are recognized
as inhering in persons with disabilities on the ground that they do not
meet the threshold for a benchmark disability. A statutory concept
which has been applied by Parliament in specific situations cannot be
extended to others where the broader expression, persons with
disability, is used statutorily. The guidelines which have been framed
on 29 August 2018 can by no means be regarded as being
exhaustive of the situations in which a scribe can be availed of by
persons other than those who suffer from benchmark disabilities. The
MSJE does not in its counter affidavit before this Court treat those
guidelines as exhaustive of the circumstances in which a scribe can
be provided for persons other than those having benchmark
disabilities. This understanding of the MSJE is correct for the simple
reason that the rights which emanate from provisions such as S.3
extend to persons with disability as broadly defined by S.2(s).
42.        We are, therefore, of the view that DoPT and UPSC have
fundamentally erred in the construction which has been placed on
the provisions of the RPwD Act 2016. To confine the facility of a
scribe only to those who have benchmark disabilities would be to
deprive a class of persons of their statutorily recognized
entitlements. To do so would be contrary to the plain terms as well
as the object of the statute."
State of Kerala and Others [2022 (1) KLT 377], observed that it
is by virtue of the statute, persons with disability are treated as a
homogeneous class irrespective of social classification. It will be better
to extract paragraph 8 of the above judgment:
“8. The State can identify classes of persons who are having
distinct characteristics or disadvantages and treat them separately
under law. Persons having disability form a homogeneous class by
themselves where disability is not on the basis of social
backwardness but on the basis of physical disability. It is relevant to
point out that the claim of the petitioners for reservation is traceable
to Art. 15 which is an enabling right, the claim of the PWD persons
traces to a statute promulgated for the purpose of implementation
of a Constitutional mandate. Therefore, it is by virtue of the statute,
persons with disability are treated as a homogeneous class
irrespective of social classification. Such a valid classification cannot
be sought to be impeached by way of linking it with Art. 16 or Art.
15 which does not apply. There is no violation of Art. 14, as Art.14
postulates equal treatment for equally placed persons that is to say
unequals can be treated unequally. To be more precise, differential
treatment is permissible when it comes to unequals. Persons
claiming social reservation fall in one compartment and persons with
disabilities who are included in the quota fall on a different distinct
compartment so there arises no question of violation of Art. 14 of
the Constitution.“
21.       In the light of the above principles, when the
Act,1995 and the Act,2016 says that the person with disability
includes mentally retarded persons also, the exclusion of mentally
retarded person from tax exemption by giving an explanation,
restricting the physically handicapped persons to that of blinds, deaf
and orthopeodically handicapped persons, is discriminatory and is
liable to be interfered by this Court. This Court is of the considered
opinion that the exclusion of mentally retarded persons from the
explanation to Ext.P3 Government Order is discriminatory and
violative of Article 14 of the Constitution of India.
22.      It is true that with effect from 01.03.2022, person
with autism or cerebral palsy or multiple disabilities or mental
retardation are exempted from tax payable while purchasing motor
cars up to the value of Rs.7 lakhs. But, as per the above notification,
the same is applicable only from 01.03.2022. It is true that Ext.P3
and    the    G.O.(P)    No.13/2022/TRANS       dated 26.04.2022    are
concessions given by the Government to certain categories of
persons.    But, when a concession is given to certain categories of
persons, there cannot be a discrimination among that category itself.
Here is a case where physically handicapped persons were given
concessions as per Ext.P3 and        G.O.(P) No.13/2022/TRANS dated
26.04.2022. But, as per Ext.P3, the mentally retarded person is not
included in the category of physically handicapped persons.           Of
course, they were included as per G.O.(P) No.13/2022/TRANS dated
26.04.2022. Admittedly the petitioner purchased the car before
26.04.2022 and after Ext.P3 Government Order.              I am of the
considered opinion that the petitioner is also entitled to tax exemption
and the amount collected from the petitioner is to be refunded to the
petitioner forthwith. If any mentally retarded person has purchased a
car in their name for their personal use for the period starting from
01.04.1998 (the date of Ext.P3) to 01.04.2022(effective date of the
G.O.(P).No.13/2022/TRANS dated 26.04.2022), all those persons are
entitled to tax exemption and if applications are filed by them, the
Government should refund the tax remitted by them.
Therefore, this writ petition is disposed of in the following
1. Ext.P4 is set aside.
2. It is declared that mentally retarded persons are also entitled
3. The respondents will refund the one time tax paid by the
petitioner (Rs.40,570/-) to him forthwith, at any rate, within a period
of three months from the date of receipt of a copy of this judgment.
4. If any mentally retarded persons have purchased a motor car
in their name during the period from 01.04.1998 till 01.03.2022 for
their own use and paid tax, they are entitled to refund of the tax, if an
application is filed to that effect.
5. The Registrar General will convey the appreciation of this
Court to Mr.Gopinath Muthukad and the entire team of Different Art
Centre (DAC) along with a copy of this judgment in the light of the
observations of this Court in paragraph-15 of this judgment.
