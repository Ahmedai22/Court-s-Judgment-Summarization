Dated this the 7th day of April, 2022
These   cases   tell   a   tale  of   an   unscrupulous
litigant who considers himself as the dominus litis,
capable of knocking down all the directions in the
judgments of this Court as well as the Apex Court in
one stroke by not pressing his petition for restitution
of  conjugal   rights   filed  before   the   Family  Court,
Thiruvananthapuram. First, we shall advert to the facts
of the case before adverting to who is the master of
the case in the Family Court jurisdiction.
2.   Anjana,  the   petitioner   in  both   cases,  met
J.A.Jayesh   Jayaram   when   she  went   to   take  driving
lessons   at   Shivanada   Motor   Driving   school.   Their
intimacy   developed,   leading   to  the  registration   of
their marriage before the Local Registrar under the
Kerala Registration of Marriages (Common) Rules, 2008
(hereinafter referred to as the (“Marriage Rules”).
Anjana's       parents   appear   to  have  objected   to   the
relationship. Alleging her illegal detention, Jayesh
Jayaram approached this Court in W.P.(Crl.) No.299/2015
seeking the writ of habeas corpus. It was alleged by
Jayesh Jayaram that he married Anjana on 20.5.2015 at
J.M.Hall,        Vellarada,    Thiruvananthapuram    and    the
marriage was registered under the Marriage Rules before
the Local Registrar of Marriages (Common) of Vellarada
Grama Panchayat on 29.5.2015. Ext.P2 in both cases is
the    certificate     of   marriage   issued  by  the    Local
Registrar       under   the   aforesaid   Rules.  Anjana    was
produced before this Court pursuant to the direction in
that case. On interaction, she denied having contracted
the marriage with Jayesh Jayaram on 20.5.2015 at J.M.
Hall, Thiruvananthapuram. According to her, she was
forced to sign the register on pressure exerted by
Jayesh Jayaram. She also stated before this Court that
she was not under any illegal confinement. Based on the
statement made before this Court by Anjana, this Court
dismissed the habeas corpus writ petition on 14.7.2015.
3. Anjana moved the Local Registrar to cancel the
registration of her marriage with Jayesh Jayaram. This
was    considered       by   the   Local    Registrar    of  marriage
pursuant to the direction of this Court in W.P.(C)
No.36328/2015.         Noting    that    there   was   no   fraud  or
manipulation, the Local Registrar rejected the request
for cancellation vide order dated 22.12.2015.
4.    Anjana      approached     the   Appellate    Authority-
Deputy      Director       of   Panchayat,      Thiruvananthapuram,
challenging        the    order   of   the   Local   Registrar.   The
Appellate        Authority,       noting      that    no    customary
ceremonies were followed in the marriage, found the
registration          of    the     marriage     to    be    illegal.
Accordingly,          ordered      the     cancellation      of   the
registration as per the order dated 28.04.2016. In the
meanwhile, Jayesh Jayaram approached the Family Court,
Thiruvananthapuram, for restitution of conjugal rights.
This was numbered as O.P.No.85/2016.
5. Jayesh Jayaram, aggrieved by the order of the
Appellate Authority cancelling registration, approached
the Director of Panchayat in revision. Simultaneously,
he    appears      to   have  moved     the   Government     as  well,
challenging the order of the Appellate Authority. The
Principal       Secretary     of   the     Local   Self    Government
Institution of Government of Kerala vide order dated
30.1.2017 interfered with the order of the Appellate
Authority and directed the revisional authority, the
Director of Panchayat to ensure that the order of the
Appellate Authority is withdrawn.
6.    Anjana      approached      this   Court     in   W.P.(C)
No.20897/2017, challenging the order of the Principal
Government        of   Kerala.   Anjana      also   had    raised   an
objection as to the maintainability of O.P.No.85/2016
on the file of the Family Court on the ground that the
Appellate Authority interfered with the registration of
marriage      in     the  local   register.      The    Family   Court
dismissed the objection raised by Anjana. Challenging
the above order, Anjana came before this Court in O.P.
(FC)     No.443/2016.      A   Division     Bench    of   this   Court
considered the writ petition filed by Anjana as W.P.(C)
No.20897/2017 and          O.P.(FC)     No.443/2016 together and
disposed of both the cases on 23.10.2017. The Division
Bench quashed the orders of the Government interfering
with the Appellate Authority's order cancelling the
registration         and  also  the     order   of   the   Appellate
Authority and relegated the parties to decide on the
validity of the marriage in O.P.No.85/2016. The order
“The same shall be done untrammeled by Ext.P8
order in I.A No.1300 of 2016 refusing to hold
that O.P No.85 of 2016 is not maintainable. We
quash Exts.P3, P4, P6,P7 and R5(b) orders as
regards       the   validity      of   Ext.P2    marriage
certificate in W.P.(C) No.20879 of 2017. The
validity of the marriage certificate will be
dependent on the final verdict in O.P No.85 of
7. Not satisfied with this Court's order as above,
Jayesh     Jayaram      moved  the    Apex   Court   in   SLP  1784-
1785/2018. The Apex Court disposed of both cases at the
SLP stage with the following orders:
“In the impugned judgment the High Court
made it very clear that the validity of the
marriage will depend upon the final verdict
in    0.P.No.85    of   2016,     which   is   pending
before the Family Court, Thiruvananthapuram.
Mr.    V.K.     Biju,   learned     counsel   for  the
petitioner       apprehends     that   since  Exhibits
P3, P4, P6, 27 and R5 (b) have been quashed,
the    Family     Court    will    be   disabled  from
rendering a finding.
We   find     it   difficult     to   appreciate  this
submission, as the High Court itself has
made it clear that the Family Court will be
free to decide the validity of the marriage.
In view of the apprehension expressed by the
learned counsel for the petitioner, we make
it clear that the Family Court will dispose
of the case on its own merits, untrammeled
by any of the observations or findings in
the impugned judgment.
The Special Leave Petition is, accordingly,
disposed of.
Pending application(s), if any, shall stand
disposed of.”
8.    Thereafter,      the   trial    commenced   before the
Family Court. PWs 1 to 7 were examined on the side of
Jayesh Jayaram. He also produced documents. Anjana was
also     examined       as   DW1.    Before     conclusion   of the
evidence, Jayesh Jayaram, filed a memo not pressing the
petition.       Accordingly,      the    Family    Court   dismissed
O.P.No.85/2016 on 17.3.2018 as not pressed.
9.    Anjana     approached     this  Court   in   review  as
against       the      common     judgment     dated     23.10.2017.
Contending       that    in   view    of   the  action    of  Jayesh
Jayaram, not pressing the petition for restitution of
conjugal      rights,     the   judgment    of   this  Court   dated
23.10.2017 in W.P.(C) No.20897/2017 will have to be
reviewed to uphold the cancellation of the registration
of the marriage in the local register. This Court,
noting that the review jurisdiction cannot be extended
to take note of subsequent events, dismissed the review
petition with liberty to agitate the grievances in
separate proceedings.
10. Anjana, thereafter, filed W.P.(C) No.6735/2022
challenging the registration of the marriage. Anjana
also filed O.P.(FC) No.127/2022 invoking Article 226 of
the Constitution challenging the judgment of the Family
Court     dismissing       the   petition     for   restitution   of
conjugal       rights     filed    by    Jayesh   Jayaram    without
endorsing that there was no valid marriage or marital
11. The facts as above would go to show that
Jayesh Jayaram considering himself to be the master of
the proceedings before the Family Court was able to
take away the substratum of all earlier directions in
the judgments given by this Court as well as the Apex
Court. We are now called upon to decide this case of
peculiar facts on its maintainability at the first
instance.       The    learned  senior   counsel  appearing  for
Jayesh Jayaram questioned the maintainability of both
cases     before     this   Court.   According  to  the  learned
senior counsel, as against the registration of marriage
in the local register, the remedy lies in an appeal
under Rule 16 of the Kerala Registration of Marriages
(Common) Rules, 2008, before the Appellate Authority.
It is also submitted that a petition under 227 is not
maintainable as against the final order of the Family
12. The learned counsel for the petitioner, on the
other hand, pointing out the earlier orders, would
submit that this Court has to treat the action of not
pressing of the petition as the issue being decided
against Jayesh Jayaram and consequently, to hold that
the registration by the Local Registrar will have to be
13. We now have to decide the consequence of not
pressing of the petition filed by Jayesh Jayaram for
restitution of conjugal rights. That will have to be
addressed in light of the challenge made as against the
order of the Family Court. Before that, we shall advert
to the challenge now made for granting registration of
the marriage between Jayesh Jayaram and Anjana by the
Local Registrar. As we adverted to earlier, this Court
as well as the Apex Court allowed the party to agitate
regarding the validity of the marriage in the petition
filed by Jayesh Jayaram for restitution of conjugal
rights. On dismissal of the petition as not pressed,
Anjana came before this Court with a review. This Court
refused to invoke review jurisdiction. This Court as
well as the Apex Court found that fact finding can be
entered upon by the Family Court and depending upon the
outcome of such fact finding, the registration can be
cancelled       or     retained.    In   such   circumstances,   a
separate      writ     petition  challenging the      registration
cannot      be    entertained     by    this   Court.  If   it  is
entertained, that would amount to reviewing the earlier
decision of this Court in W.P.(C) No.20897/2017.
14.     We     come   back    to    O.P.(FC)   No.127/2022,
challenging the order of the Family Court. Can the
Family Court allow Jayesh Jayaram to not press the
petition overlooking the direction of this Court as
well as the Apex Court?            We are of the view that the
Family Court could have allowed “not pressing” to the
extent of Jayesh Jayaram giving up the relief sought,
however, that could not have restrained the Family
Court from deciding the substantial issue regarding the
validity of the marriage.
15. Who is the master of the case in the Family
Court?       Is it the petitioner or the Court?              In an
ordinary Civil Court, where the rights and obligations
of the parties are decided, the plaintiff is the master
of case. The Family Court is governed by the Family
Courts Act and Rules. In the Family Court, the enquiry
is more focussed on the parties and not on the process
of litigation. The Family Court is not bound by the
rigidity       of    the Rules     of  Procedure   followed in
adversarial litigation. Section 10(3) of the Family
Courts Act, 1984, states as follows:
“Nothing in sub-section (1) or sub-section (2)
shall prevent a Family Court from laying down
its own procedure with a view to arrive at a
settlement in respect of the subject-matter of
the suit or proceedings or at the truth of the
facts alleged by the one party and denied by
the other.”
16. Recently, we have referred to the functions of
the Family Court. In Nisha Haneefa v. Abdul Latheef, Ors.
[2022     ICO     320],  it    is   appropriate  to   refer to
paragraphs 4 to 6, which reads thus:
“4. A combined reading of Sections 9, 10
and 14 would clearly bring out the point
that the Family Court is not the mirror of
an ordinary Civil Court. The powers of the
Family Court can be summarized as follows:
(i) Adjudicative power following the rules
of    procedure    as    applicable   under   the
adversarial system. (ii) Proactive role for
settlement of disputes between the parties.
(iii) Inquisitorial power to enquire into
the truth of the matter.
5. The above enumerated powers are only for
the    Family    Court.   That   distinguishes    it
from      an    ordinary     Civil   Court.    More
interestingly, it is to be noted that as
reflected from Section 10(3), the Family
Court is given the power to lay down its
own    procedure    with   a   view  to  arrive    a
settlement, or to enquire into the truth of
the facts alleged. The power to choose the
mode     of    procedure     itself   sufficiently
indicates      that  the   Family   Court  is   not
bound by any strictness of procedure of law
as referred in the Code of Civil Procedure,
the Indian Evidence Act, Criminal Procedure
Code etc. What is essential in a dispute
before the Family Court is that the Family
Court is only to devise procedure for fair
conclusion      of   the    proceedings.   If    the
Family      Court  is  able    to  adhere  to   the
“fairness”, the decision or order of the
Family      Court  cannot    be  questioned   in   a
higher Court. The Family Court is given
complete freedom in devising fair procedure
for speedy resolution of disputes before
the said Court.
6. The role of the presiding officer in the
Family Court needs to be stressed herein.
As already adverted to, in all matters,
what is required by the Family Court is a
fair approach in dealing with the cases
before     it.   In   many   of   the   matters  like
custody,       maintenance,     matrimonial    status
etc., the responsibility of the Court is to
find    out     the   truth.    The   focus   of  the
enquiry is to be on the objectives to be
secured       rather    than     focusing    on   the
subjective element of the dispute. The very
purpose of entrusting family disputes to
the Family Court from ordinary Civil Court
is    to     focus    not    on    the   rights   and
obligations of the disputants but on the
interest of the parties and welfare of the
subject of the dispute. It is also to be
remembered       that    the     disputes    amenable
before      the    Family    Court    sometimes   may
require to follow the rules of adversarial
litigation. But that does not mean that the
Family      Court    Judge    is    restrained   from
conducting enquiry related to the truth as,
in an inquisitorial model. To find out the
truth, the Family Court does not require
the consent of the parties. If fairness is
reflected in any of the approaches, such an
approach is clothed with legal protection.”
17. The party may be able to not press the relief
sought. However, the party cannot refrain the Family
Court from the finding of truth. The Family Court
cannot     remain      a  mute   spectator     of   the   proceedings
before it. If the Family Court is of the view that the
opposite       party      would    be     affected    or    impacted,
consequent upon not pressing the petition, it shall
proceed      with     the   case   to    find   out   the   truth  as
mentioned in the Nisha Haneefa's case (supra). The
scope of enquiry in the Family Court is not confined
with the evidence brought before it by the parties. The
Family Court is competent to embark upon any enquiry to
elicit the truth. The master of the proceedings before
the Family Court is the presiding officer of the Family
Court and not the parties. So long as the principles of
fairness are followed and adhered to, the power of the
Family Court cannot be questioned by the parties.
18. The Family Court ought not to have accepted
the request to dismiss the petition in toto without
entering into the findings regarding the status of the
marriage. Anjana was not afforded an opportunity to
express her views by the Family Court before acting on
the memo filed by Jayesh Jayaram not pressing the case.
In light of this Court order as well as the Apex
Court's order, the Family Court ought to have afforded
an opportunity to Anjana to state her views before the
Court on the motion moved by Jayesh Jayaram to ‘not-
press the case’.          When rights and obligations of the
parties to a litigation are crystalised through the
order of the Court, the basis of such an order cannot
be    whittled       down  by  one   party by   his  unilateral
decision of not pressing the case.            The Court has to
act on such a decision of not pressing by one party as
holding that the issues are decided against such a
19. In the light of the peculiar facts, we are of
the view that the Family Court failed in exercising the
jurisdiction in accordance with the Family Courts Act,
1984 and the direction of this Court and the Apex
20. A Division Bench of this Court in Muhammed
Master v. Abu Haji [1981 KLT 578]              and Mariyam v.
Vijayarajan [2015 (1) KLT 341] have noted the effect of
not pressing the suit. According to the Division Bench
“not pressing would have the effect of the issue being
decided against the litigant who does not press and in
favour of the opponent”.
The inevitable conclusion, therefore, is that the
Family Court could not have dismissed the petition for
restitution of conjugal rights without going into the
question of validity of the marriage. In light of the
earlier judgments of this Court as well as the Apex
Court, the issue regarding validity of the marriage
will have to be decided by the Family Court. In that,
the Family Court will have to note the stand taken by
Jayesh       Jayaram   not  pressing    the   petition. We,
therefore, interfere with the impugned judgment in O.P.
(FC)     No.127/2022,    to the    limited  extent  for not
deciding on the validity of the marriage. We direct the
Family Court to pronounce the judgment on the validity
of the marriage in light of the stand taken by Jayesh
Jayaram not pressing the same. Needful shall be done
within four weeks from the date of appearance. The
parties are directed to appear before the Family Court
on 18.4.2022.          O.P.(FC) No.127/2022 is disposed of as
above.      W.P.(C) No.6735/2022 is disposed of with the
observation        that    cancellation  or  retention  of  the
registration of the marriage would depend upon the
outcome      of    the    judgment   of  the  Family  Court  in
O.P.No.85/2016. No order as to costs.
