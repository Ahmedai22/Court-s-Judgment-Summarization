1.       The petitioner by this application under Section 34 of the
Arbitration and Conciliation Act 1996, impugns the award dated
03.07.2021 rendered by the Arbitral Tribunal deciding Issue no.3 in
favour of the respondent and against the petitioner.
2.       Issue no. 3 as framed reads as under:-
O.M.P. (COMM) 185/2022                                                     Page 1 of 12

Whether the action of the Respondent/PMC in granting
provisional extension of time is in conformity with the
terms of the agreement?”
3.       Learned Senior Counsel appearing for the petitioner submits
that issue no.3 is intrinsically connected with issue no. 5 and the
Arbitral Tribunal has erred in deciding issue no.3 in isolation.
4.       Issue no.5 as framed reads as under:
“Whether the actions of the Respondent/PMC in
imposing liquidated damages/compensation for delay
with retrospective effect is inconformity with the terms of
5.       Learned Senior Counsel for the petitioner further contends that
the Arbitral Tribunal has erred in rejecting the contention of the
petitioner that the extension of the time granted was only provisional
and petitioner had reserved its rights to impose liquidated damages at
the end of the work.
6.       Learned Senior Counsel for the petitioner further submits that
the extension of time granted was only provisional and on the
conclusion of the contract, petitioners were entitled to assess the exact
number of days of delay and accordingly levy compensation for the
O.M.P. (COMM) 185/2022                                                  Page 2 of 12

7.       Per contra, learned Senior Counsel appearing for the respondent
contends that the extension of the time was not provisional and can
never be provisional and once extension of time is granted same
cannot be curtailed specially after the extended period is over.
8.       For purposes of determining the controversy, brief reference to
the factual matrix would be required. Petitioner had awarded the
subject contract to the respondent for construction of Civic Centre at
JLN Marg, Minto Road, Delhi vide agreement dated 21.05.2005.
9.       It is not in dispute that there were certain events which led to
the delay in the execution of the contract. Respondent Contractor
applied for extension of time on several occasions, which were
granted.
10.      Petitioner granted the requests in each case upto a specified
date, however, also mentioned that it was without prejudice to the
rights of the petitioner to recover liquidated damages in accordance
with the provision of Clause 2 of the agreement.
11.      The contention of the respondent is that the work was
completed within the stipulated period of the contract by including the
extended periods as sanctioned by the petitioner and the work did not

extend beyond the extensions granted by the petitioner.
12.      The contention of the petitioner before the Arbitral Tribunal
and even before this court is that at the conclusion of the work it was
open to the petitioner to re-assess the extensions granted and
determine as to whether the extensions granted were correct or not
and also that the number of days could be reduced.
13.      In the present case, petitioner has after the conclusion of the
work and after the period stipulated by the contract and the extended
periods as sanctioned, have expired, re-assessed the number of days of
delay and reduced the extended period and levied compensation of
liquidated damages.
14.      Clause 2 refers to compensation for delay in completion of the
work and reads as under:
If the contractor fails to maintain the required progress
in terms of Clause 5 or to complete the work and clear
the site on or before the contract or extended date of
completion, he shall, without prejudice to any other right
or remedy available under the law to the MCD on
account of such breach, pay as agreed compensation the
amount calculated at the rates stipulated below as the
Engineer-in-Charge (whose decision in writing shall be
final and binding) may decide on the amount of tendered
value of the work for every completed day/month (as
O.M.P. (COMM) 185/2022                                                Page 4 of 12

applicable) that the progress remains below that
specified in Clause 5 or that the work remains
incomplete.
15.      Clause 5 of the Agreement reads as under:
Time and Extension for Delay
The time allowed for execution of the work as
specified in the Schedule F' or the extended time in
accordance with these conditions shall be the essence of
the Contract. The execution of the works shall commence
from the 10th day or such time period as mentioned in
Letter of Award after the date on which the Engineer-in-
Charge issues written orders to commence the work or
from the date of handing over of the site whichever is
later. If the Contractor commits default in commencing
the execution of the work as aforesaid MCD shall without
prejudice to any other right or remedy available in law,
be at liberty to forfeit the earnest money and
performance guarantee absolutely.
5.1    As soon as possible after the Contract is concluded
the Contractor shall submit a Time & Progress
Chart for each milestone and get it approved by
the Department. The Chart shall be prepared in
direct relation to the time stated in the Contract
documents for completion of items of the works. It
shall indicate the forecast of the dates of
commencement and completion of various trades

of sections of the work and may be amended as
necessary by agreement between the Engineer-in
Charge and the Contractor within the limitations
of time imposed in the Contract documents, and
further to ensure good progress during the
execution of the work, the contractor shall in all
cases in which the time allowed for any work,
exceeds one month (save for special jobs for which
a separate programme has been agreed upon)
complete the work as per milestones.
5.2    If the work(s) be delayed by:-
(iii)   serious loss or damage by fire, or
(iv)    civil commotion, local commotion of
workmen, strike or lockout, affecting any of
the trades employed on the work, or
(v)     delay on the part of other contractors or
tradesmen engaged by Engineer-in-Charge
in executing work not forming part of the
(vi) any other cause which, in the absolute
discretion of the authority mentioned in Schedule
'F' is beyond the Contractor's control.
then upon the happening of any such event causing
delay, the Contractor shall immediately give notice
thereof in writing to the Engineer-in-Charge but
shall nevertheless use constantly his best
O.M.P. (COMM) 185/2022                                                  Page 6 of 12

endeavours to prevent or make good the delay and
shall do all that may be reasonably required to the
satisfaction of the Engineer-in-Charge to proceed
with the works.
5.3    Request for rescheduling of Milestones and
extension of time, to be eligible for consideration,
shall be made by the Contractor in writing within
fourteen days of the happening of the event
causing delay on the prescribed form. The
Contractor may also, if practicable, indicate in
such a request the period for which extension is
desired.
5.4    In any such case the authority mentioned in
Schedule 'F' may give a fair and reasonable
extension of time and reschedule the milestones for
completion of work, such extension shall be
communicated to the contractor by the Engineer-
in-Charge in writing, within 3 months of the date
of receipt of such request. Non application by the
contractor for extension of time shall not be a bar
for giving a fair and reasonable extension by the
Engineer-in-Charge and this shall be binding on
the contractor.”
16.      Referring to clauses 5.3 and 5.4, the Arbitral Tribunal has held
“Thus, in case where the contractor does not make a
request for rescheduling of milestone and EOT within the
period of fourteen days, only two alternatives are left to
the Respondent (EIC) / competent authority, namely: -
O.M.P. (COMM) 185/2022                                                  Page 7 of 12

i)     To give a fair and reasonable extension (as per
clause 5.4) even, in spite of, non-application by the
ii)    To declare that the contractor is not eligible for
consideration for EOT, after ensuring that such
declaration would be fair and reasonable, as per
clause 5.3.
There is no third choice available to the Respondent
under the contract.
Thus, in the present case, after considering the
contractor as eligible for EOT, question of any further
default of the contractor, on the provisions of Clause No.
5.3, does not arise.”
17.      Clause 5.2 provides for the eventualities under which extension
of time can be granted, Clause 5.2 further stipulates that on happening
of any of the events stipulated therein the contractor is to a give notice
to the engineer in-charge. The contractor however, has to continue to
make best endeavors to prevent or make good the delay and is also
required to carry on to proceeds with the work to the satisfaction of
the engineer-in-charge.
18.      Clause 5.3 of the contract stipulates that the contractor is
eligible for consideration for rescheduling the milestone and extension
of time and must make a request in writing within 14 days of the
happening of the event. In the said request the contractor has to also

indicate the period for which the extension is desired.
19.      Clause 5.4 stipulates that the engineer in charge has to give a
fair and reasonable extension of time and reschedule the milestone for
completion of the work. Such extension has to be communicated to
the contractor in writing within three months of the date of receipt of
such request. Even in a case where there is no application filed by the
contractor the engineer in charge is empowered to grant fair and
reasonable extension, which extension would be binding on the
contractor.
20.      In the present case, requests for the extension were made and
granted, though petitioner reserved their right to levy to recover
liquidated damages in accordance with provisions of Clause 2 of the
agreement.
21.      The contention of learned Senior Counsel for the petitioner that
the extensions were only provisional and Petitioner could reassess the
delay is not sustainable.
22.      Once a request is received and extension of time is granted, the
engineer in charge/the competent authority cannot after the extended
period is over turn around and reassess the extension to the detriment
of the contractor. If extension is granted, say for a period of three
months, the engineer in charge after expiry of three months cannot
O.M.P. (COMM) 185/2022                                                Page 9 of 12

turn around and say that the extension should have, in fact, been for a
period of two months.
23.      Though it may be open to the competent authority/engineer in-
charge to, in the first instance, grant an extension for a shorter period
than requested and thereafter extend it further but he cannot having
once granted it, curtail it retrospectively.
24.      Clause 5.4 stipulates that the decision on the extension of time
has to be communicated within a period of three months, which pre-
supposes that an estimation or calculation would have to be made by
the competent authority within the period of three months and a
conscious decision taken and communicated. The competent authority
cannot mechanically grant an extension in the first instance and then
after the period is over, reduce the same retrospectively.
25.      I am in complete agreement with the view taken by the Arbitral
Tribunal in deciding Issue no.3 and in holding that only two options
were available to the competent authority, i.e. (i) either to grant a fair
and reasonable extension in terms of Clause 5.4 even in case where
there is no application by the contractor; or (ii) to declare that the
contractor is not eligible for consideration for extension of time.
26.      The competent authority would not be empowered to treat the
extension of time granted as provisional and thereafter reduce the
O.M.P. (COMM) 185/2022                                                Page 10 of 12

period after the period is itself over.
27.      Further, contention of learned Senior Counsel for the petitioner
that issue No. 3 could not have been decided in isolation, dehors
decision on issue No. 5 is also not sustainable for the reason that both
the issues are independent of each other, though, there may be some
overlap.
28.      Issue No.5 pertains to imposition of liquidated damages
/compensation for delay. Clause 2 of the contract prescribes for
imposition of damages in case the work is not completed within the
contractual period and the extended period. Issue No. 3 is as to
whether the extension of time is provisional or not.
29.      Even if there is some overlap in the said issues, there is no error
committed by the Tribunal in deciding them separately, particularly
when there is no error in the findings returned in respect of issue
No.3. The view taken by the arbitral tribunal is a plausible view.
30.      If in the facts of the case, the tribunal was to come to a
conclusion that the work was not completed within the period of the
contract or the extended date of completion then it would be open to
the Arbitral Tribunal to decide issue No.5 accordingly.
31.      Further, the decision on issue No.3 is a question of law and
O.M.P. (COMM) 185/2022                                                 Page 11 of 12

interpretation of the conditions of the contract and the decision on
issue No.5 would primarily be a question of fact. Merely because
issue No.3 has been decided does not pre judge issue No.5. Clearly,
there is no error committed by the Arbitral Tribunal in deciding issue
No.3 first and leaving the determination of issue No.5 to a later date.
32.      Furthermore, it may be observed that the subject award
emanates out of an International Commercial Arbitration with its seat
in Delhi and Section 34(2A) of the Arbitration Act is not applicable
and as such the challenge to the award is further limited than as may
be available in the case of a domestic arbitration.
33.      Even otherwise, this court has found that there is no error, leave
alone a patent illegality, committed by the Arbitral Tribunal in
deciding issue No.3 particularly in interpreting Clauses 5.2 to 5.4 of
the agreement.
34.      In view of the above, there is no merit in the petition. The
petition is accordingly dismissed.
35.      It is clarified that the Arbitral Tribunal would be at liberty to
decide the remaining issues without being influenced by anything
stated herein on merits.
