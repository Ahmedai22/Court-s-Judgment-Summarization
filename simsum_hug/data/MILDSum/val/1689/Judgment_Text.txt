Advocate for R-1/AIIMS.
The proceedings in the matter have been conducted through
video conferencing.
1.      By way of this petition under Article 226 of the Constitution,
the petitioners assail an Office Memorandum [hereinafter “OM”]
dated 18.10.2021, issued by the respondent No.1 -All India Institute of
Medical Sciences [hereinafter “AIIMS”], New Delhi, whereby their
admissions to the M.Sc. Nursing course in the academic session 2021-
2022 have been cancelled.
2.      The facts of the case are not in dispute. AIIMS invited
applications for admission to various postgraduate courses, including
M.Sc. Nursing, by way of a Prospectus issued on 27.04.2021. The
eligibility conditions contained in the Prospectus, as far as the M.Sc.
Nursing course is concerned, read as follows:
i)      B.Sc. (Hons.) Nursing /B.Sc. Nursing (Post-
course from any recognised University, from an
educational institution Recognised by the Indian
Gen/OBC/NCL)/EWS candidates (55% marks in
case of SC/ST candidates).
(ii)    Registration as Nurse, RN, RM (Registered Nurse,
Registered Midwife) with any State Nursing
Note 1: For Indian Nationals, 5% reservation for
Person with Benchmark Disability shall be
provided on horizontal basis, in the seat
available in M.Sc. Nursing courses. Eligibility
criterion for candidates under this category as
per the guidelines finalized by Nursing Council
of India as amended from time-to-time.
Note 2: For M.Sc/ M.Biotechnology and M.Sc. Nursing
Courses :- Candidates who are due to appear at
the qualifying examination, or have already
appeared and are awaiting result, can also
apply for admission but such candidate must
- Proof of passing the qualifying examination
on or before 31st July, 2021 with requisite
percentage of marks and subjects failing
which their performance at the Entrance
Examination will not be considered.
- All M.Sc. Nursing Candidates can submit
certificate of Registration as a Nurse and
Midwife from the Indian Nursing Council/State
Allocation/joining if they are selected.
- All selected candidates for M.Sc. Nursing
courses are required to furnish the proof of
recognition of their college at the time of
3.      The petitioners, who were students in the B.Sc. Nursing course
in AIIMS, New Delhi, applied for admission pursuant to the
Prospectus. They were issued offer letters by AIIMS on 18.08.2021,
which inter alia indicated the speciality, and the regional centre of
AIIMS in which they were offered admission. The petitioners joined
their respective courses on 24.08.2021, as required, and were duly
enrolled by the respective regional centre of AIIMS.
4.      Approximately two months thereafter, by the impugned OM
dated 18.10.2021, issued by AIIMS, New Delhi, their admissions were
cancelled. It was stated in the OM that the matter had been examined
by the competent authority, and “due to discrepancy found in the
admissions, it has been decided that all erroneous admissions
mentioned below need to be cancelled”. The reason for cancellation of
their admissions, as mentioned in the OM, is as follows:
“B.Sc. Nursing final year Result declared on 7th Aug,
2021 beyond the cutoff date i.e. 31st July 2021 (as
mentioned in the prospectus)”
Emphasis supplied.
5.      The petitioners thereafter filed the present writ petition
challenging the OM dated 18.10.2021.
6.      By an interim order dated 28.10.2021, the petitioners were
granted interim relief of status quo with regard to their admissions.
They have continued to study in their respective courses during the
pendency of this writ petition.
7.      Mr. Wills Mathews, learned counsel for the petitioners, submits
that the cancellation of the petitioners’ admissions after they had
joined the course, on the ground that they were ineligible for
admission, is unwarranted and contrary to law. He submits that no
allegation of any wrongdoing has been levelled against the petitioners;
they have not been accused of any misrepresentation or suppression of
facts, which led to the admission being granted despite their
ineligibility. All the petitioners were, in fact, students of AIIMS itself
in the B.Sc. Nursing course, which is the qualifying examination for
the purposes of admission to the M.Sc. Nursing. The delay in the
results of their qualifying examination was, therefore, not only known
to AIIMS, but a consequence of matters within its own control. Mr.
Mathews points out that, in the year 2020, AIIMS had extended the
period under the eligibility conditions until 31.08.2020, but a similar
extension has not been granted in the year 2021.
8.      In order to buttress his submissions, Mr. Mathews relies upon
judgments of the Supreme Court in A. Sudha vs. University of Mysore
and Another2 and Dolly Chhanda vs. Chairman, JEE And Others3, as
well as the judgments of this Court in Javed Akhtar and Another vs.
Jamia Hamdard & Another4, and Bessy Edison and Another vs. Indira
9.       Mr. Dushyant Parashar, learned counsel for AIIMS, on the other
hand, submits that the petitioners admittedly did not meet the
eligibility criteria specified in the Prospectus on the stipulated date. He
emphasises that the eligibility criteria stipulated in the Prospectus
requires candidates to have proof of passing the qualifying
examination before 31.07.2021, whereas the results of the petitioners’
qualifying examination was declared only on 07.08.2021.
10.      Mr. Parashar refers me to Clause 9 of Section 13 of the
Prospectus6, to submit that the Prospectus itself contemplated that
admissions would be provisional, and subject to cancellation at any
time. The said clause reads as follows:
“9.     Admission of the candidates to the entrance
examination is provisional. If ineligibility of a
candidate is detected at any stage, his/her
candidature for examination/admission will be
cancelled.”
11.       Mr. Parashar argues that the petitioners were found to have
been admitted despite their ineligibility, and their admissions were,
therefore, cancelled in due exercise of the powers of AIIMS under the
said clause. He submits that an institution ought not to be compelled to

Judgment dated 26.10.2010 in W.P.(C) No. 5604/2010.
perpetuate an error, in departure from the eligibility conditions
mentioned in the prospectus itself, and relies upon the judgment of this
Court in Varun Kumar Agarwal vs. Union of India & Ors7 in this
12.      Finally, Mr. Parashar states that the relief sought by the
petitioners would lead to a wholly iniquitous situation, as several other
candidates, whose results were also declared on or before 07.08.2021,
were rejected on the same ground.
13.      In the undisputed factual situation narrated above, the question
which arises for consideration is whether the admission of a candidate,
even if he/she is erroneously admitted, is liable to be cancelled in the
absence of any wrongdoing or default on the part of the candidate.
This question has been considered in several judgments of the
Supreme Court and of this Court. Three judgments of the Supreme
Court, and one of this Court, are particularly instructive for
adjudication of the present dispute.
14.      In Rajendra Prasad Mathur vs. Karnataka University8, the
Supreme Court was concerned with a question of cancellation of
admissions in engineering courses in Karnataka University. During the
pendency of the writ petition before the High Court, the petitioners
were permitted to continue their studies in the college. The petitions
were, however, ultimately dismissed by the High Court, and the
Supreme Court also came to the conclusion that the candidates were

ineligible for admission. However, on the question of whether the
students, having been admitted, should be permitted to continue their
studies, the Court held in their favour for the following reasons:-
“8. We accordingly endorse the view taken by the
learned Judge and affirmed by the Division Bench of the
High Court. But the question still remains whether we
should allow the appellants to continue their studies in
the respective engineering colleges in which they were
admitted. It was strenuously pressed upon us on behalf of
the appellants that under the orders initially of the
learned Judge and thereafter of this Court they have been
pursuing their course of study in the respective
engineering colleges and their admissions should not now
be disturbed because if they are now thrown out after a
period of almost four years since their admission their
whole future will be blighted. Now it is true that the
appellants were not eligible for admission to the
engineering degree course and they had no legitimate
claim to such admission. But it must be noted that the
blame for their wrongful admission must lie more upon
the engineering colleges which granted admission than
upon the appellants. It is quite possible that the
appellants did not know that neither the Higher
Secondary Examination of the Secondary Education
Board, Rajasthan nor the first year BSc examination of
the Rajasthan and Udaipur Universities was recognised
as equivalent to the Pre-University Examination of the
appellants being young students from Rajasthan might
have presumed that since they had passed the first year
BSc examination of the Rajasthan or Udaipur University
or in any event the Higher Secondary Examination of the
Secondary Education Board, Rajasthan they were eligible
for admission. The fault lies with the engineering
colleges which admitted the appellants because the
Principals of these engineering colleges must have
known that the appellants were not eligible for
admission and yet for the sake of capitation fee in some
of the cases they granted admission to the appellants.
We do not see why the appellants should suffer for the
sins of the managements of these engineering colleges.
We would therefore, notwithstanding the view taken by
us in this Judgment, allow the appellants to continue
their studies in the respective engineering colleges in
which they were granted admission. But we do feel that
against the erring engineering colleges the Karnataka
University should take appropriate action because the
managements of these engineering colleges have not only
admitted students ineligible for admission but thereby
deprived an equal number of eligible students from
getting admission to the engineering degree course. We
also endorse the directions given by the learned Judge in
the penultimate paragraph of his Judgment with a view to
preventing admission of ineligible students.”9
15.      This judgment was followed by the Supreme Court inter alia in
A. Sudha10, which was also cited by Mr. Mathews. The candidate in
that case was also ineligible, and was permitted to prosecute her
studies in MBBS course in the respondent-institution.
16.      The judgment of the Supreme Court in Ashok Chand Singhvi vs.
University of Jodhpur and Ors11, is also on similar lines. In that case,
the Supreme Court did not accept the explanation of the concerned
university that the candidate had been mistakenly admitted, but also
clarified12 that even if that had been the case, the principle in Rajendra

Supra (note 11), paragraph 17.
Prasad Mathur13, would have been followed as the candidate was not
at fault.
17.      In Javed Akhtar14, a co-ordinate bench of this Court considered
a case where the petitioners’ candidature was accepted for appearing
in the entrance examinations, and they were admitted to the concerned
institution. Their admissions were cancelled after they had attended
the classes for one month. The facts of the case are very similar to the
present case. The question framed by the Court was in the following
“21. … This is not disputed that the petitioners filled the
forms for appearing in the entrance examination and
gave their correct date of birth. The forms of the
petitioners were considered and they were allowed to
appear in the examination. After their names appeared,
they were called for counselling and after verifying the
documents and certificates of the petitioners, they were
given admission. The petitioners were issued identity
cards after accepting the fees for the course from them
and the petitioners were allowed to attend classes for a
month and thereafter by communication dated 8th August,
2006 the admission of the petitioners have been
cancelled. Whether the respondent no. 1 can be allowed
to cancel the admission mid term in the facts and
circumstances, when the petitioners have not concealed
any thing nor produced any documents to mislead the
respondent no. 1? Whether the respondent no. 1 will be
estopped from canceling the admission of the petitioners
The Court answered the question thus:-
Emphasis supplied.
“38. Therefore, while granting the admission if the
academic body has acted inattentively and
mechanically, then they cannot be allowed to take the
plea that the admission was never valid and that the
petitioners' were ineligible from the very inception and
knowing the ineligibility they applied for admission. The
respondents cannot be allowed to cancel the admission
at their own convenience at any time of the year without
considering the fact that if they cancel the admission
after the session has started then the entire year of the
petitioners will be spoiled as the petitioners would not be
in a position to take admission in any other
college/University. If this fact of their ineligibility for
admission was conveyed to them at the very start they
would have taken admission in some other
college/University.
39. In such situation, in view of the decision in
Sangeeta’s case(Supra), the petitioners cannot be
penalized for the negligence of authorities. It is
important to appreciate that the petitioners in the facts
and circumstances cannot be accused of making any
false statement or suppressing any relevant fact before
anybody. They clearly mentioned their Date of Birth in
the application form for admission, and are not guilty of
any fraud or misrepresentation. It was the duty of the
University to have scrutinized the application form and
the certificates thoroughly before granting admission to
the petitioners and permitting them to attend the classes
and not having done so they cannot cancel the admission
thereafter. By accepting the application form and
subsequently granting admission representation was
made by the respondents that the petitioners’ were
eligible for admission and the petitioners’ acting upon
the same took admission and thus the petitioners’
suffered a detriment. Had the respondents not made the
representation that the application had been approved
and granted admission the petitioners’ would have
applied and taken admission else-where. Therefore the
respondents are estopped from pleading that the
petitioners were not entitled to a seat from the inception
and that the admission is void ab initio and that the
admission without fulfilment of the eligibility criteria is a
nullity.
40. In the facts and circumstances of the case the
respondents cannot be allowed to take advantage of
their own wrong and cannot be permitted to take the
plea that under the prospectus they had the power to
cancel the admission of ineligible student and the
principle of estoppel will operate against them. The
respondents are estopped from cancelling the admission
of the petitioners’ and further from preventing them from
pursuing the ‘Pre Tib’ course in the present facts and
18.      Applying these authorities in the present case, it appears that the
petitioners’ documents were accepted by the respective centres of
AIIMS, despite the fact that their qualifying examination results were
declared one week later than stipulated in the Prospectus. The
petitioners have prosecuted their studies for almost two months prior
to issuance of the impugned OM dated 18.10.2021. There is no
allegation that the petitioners had misrepresented or concealed any
information from AIIMS - indeed, there cannot be, as the qualifying
examination was conducted by AIIMS itself. Applying the
observations of the Supreme Court in Rajendra Prasad Mathur17, in
the present case also, the blame lies more upon the institution than the
petitioners. The candidates applied; their results were declared by
AIIMS, New Delhi; those results were submitted to the regional

Supra (note 8), paragraph 8.
centres to which they have been assigned, and they were granted
admission. Their admissions were cancelled after they had spent
almost two months on the course. The judgment of this Court in Javed
Akhtar18, in fact, goes further to hold that an academic institution
cannot be permitted to cancel admissions after the course had started,
at any time during the year, due to prejudice that would be caused to
the candidates who were admitted as they would by then be unable to
take admission in any other university to which they may have been
19.      The issue thus appears to me to be squarely covered by the
aforesaid judgments of the Supreme Court and this Court. Although
there were express representations of the institutions to the candidates
regarding their eligibility in some of the cases, I am of the view that
the absence of such an express representation does not make much
difference in the facts of the present case. No further representation
was expected or required as there was no doubt as to the substantive
conditions of eligibility stipulated in the Prospectus, although the
result had come one week later than stipulated.
20.      While considering the equitable relief to be granted in these
circumstances, I also requested Mr. Parashar to take instructions as to
the fate of the seats which would be released by the petitioners if the
impugned OM were to be upheld. Mr. Parashar, upon instructions,
fairly submitted that due to the lapse in time after the start of the
course, those seats would remain vacant.
21.      Turning now to the two other judgments cited by Mr. Mathews,
they do not, in my view, apply to the facts of this case. In Dolly
Chhanda19, the petitioner therein had been wrongly rejected for
admission and the Supreme Court directed that she should be given
admission in the MBBS course in the next academic year. This is not
relevant to the question which arises in the present case. In Bessy
Edison20, the issue before the Court was different from the present
case. It concerned approval of a particular study centre for the
purposes of Post-Basic B.Sc. in Nursing qualification offered by the
Court found that IGNOU was under a bona fide belief that it was not
required to obtain approval from each of its study centre, and that the
petitioners had taken admission in the belief that the centre was
recognized by the Indian Nursing Council. The Court held that the
examination having been conducted by the University itself, equity
was in favour of grant of relief, and relied upon the wide powers of the
Court under Article 226 of the Constitution to grant relief to the
petitioners therein.
22.      The conditions of the Prospectus, cited by Mr. Parashar, and the
judgment of this Court in Varun Kumar Agarwal21, also do not lead
me to a contrary conclusion. Clause 9 in Section 13 of the Prospectus
concerns admission “to the entrance examination”. In my view, the
Clause, as it stands, provides for cancellation of the candidature for
the admission examination. In any event, even on the assumption that
AIIMS was vested with the power to cancel the petitioners’
admissions, for the reasons aforesaid, I have come to the conclusion
that the power ought not to have been exercised in the present case.
The judgment in Varun Kumar Agarwal22, provides that the conditions
of the brochure are mandatory. That proposition is well settled.
However, the question in the present case is not of applying the
eligibility conditions to deny admission to a particular candidate, but
of cancellation of an admission after it has been granted, and the
candidate has taken his/her place in the university/institution. There
may be cases where the ineligibility is such as to militate against the
grant of equitable relief even to an admitted candidate. The present
situation is, however, covered by the decisions of the Supreme Court
and this Court as stated above, and I see no reason, in law or equity, to
differ from the conclusions reached therein.
23.      As far as Mr. Parashar’s contention with regard to the similarly
placed candidates is concerned, it is made clear that the present
petition concerns a case of cancellation of admissions once granted, as
dealt with in the aforesaid judgments of the Supreme Court and this
Court. The Court is not faced with a claim for admission by a
candidate who has not been granted admission, which is contested as
being contrary to the eligibility conditions contained in the admissions
brochure. It is, therefore, not necessary to comment further on the fate
of those other candidates in the context of the facts and circumstances
of the present case.
24.     For the reasons aforesaid, the writ petition is allowed, and the
impugned OM dated 18.10.2021 issued by AIIMS, New Delhi, so far
as it concerns the petitioners herein, is set aside. Pending application
also stands disposed of.
25.     There will be no order as to costs.
