The Delhi High Court has recently imposed Rs. 10,000 cost on a party for appearing in vest during the virtual hearing, observing that such a conduct was totally unacceptable. 
"During the course of VC petitioner no. 5 has appeared through VC for his identification by the IO in his vest. The conduct of the petitioner no.5 in appearing before the Court in his vest is totally unacceptable. Even though the proceedings were being conducted through VC he should have appeared before the Court in proper clothes," Justice Rajnish Bhatnagar ordered 
The Court added that the cost imposed shall be deposited with the Delhi High Court Legal Services Committee within a week by the party. 
The Court was dealing with petition seeking quashing of FIR registered concerning a matrimonial dispute registered under Sections 498A, 323, 341, /506 and 34 of the IPC. 
The petitioner no 1 (husband) and respondent no 2 (wife) got married on 6.12.2014 according to Hindu rites and ceremonies. After differences arose between them, they started living separately since 15.10.2019 and the FIR was registered thereafter. 
During the course of hearing, the Court was apprised by the petitioners that during the pendency of the trial, the parties had settled the matter amicably and that the petition under Section 13-B(2) of the Hindu Marriage Act was allowed and the marriage was dissolved by way of a decree passed by the family court. 
The petitioners also submitted that the visitation rights of the girl child which were not given to the petitioner-husband and thus requested that the wife may be directed to send an e-mail every month informing him about the well-being of the girl child.
On this, the wife informed the CourtÂ that she had no objection to the same and would be sending e-mail to the husband every month keeping him informed about the well being of the girl child.
"Keeping in view the above facts and circumstances, since the matter has been amicably settled between the parties, no useful purpose will be served by keeping the case pending. It will be nothing but abuse of the process of law. Consequentially, this petition is allowed and FIR No.0286/2019, under Section 498A/323/341/506/34 IPC, registered at Police Station Safdarjung Enclave, Delhi, and the proceedings emanating therefrom shall stand quashed," the Court said while quashing the FIR.
