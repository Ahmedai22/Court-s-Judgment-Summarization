01.07.2022 in the General Council Meeting scheduled to be held on
11.07.2022, pending disposal of the suit.
9. The brief case of the 1st respondent-plaintiff is as follows:-
(i) According to the 1st respondent, the 2nd respondent Political
Party, viz., All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (in short
“AIADMK”) is a recognized Political Party of the Election Commission
of India, formed in 1972 by late Mr.M.G.Ramachandran and it is
governed by its Bye-Laws.              The 2nd respondent Organization is in
consonance with the Representation of the People Act, 1951 and the
Rules of Election Commission of India.                 The Rules of Election
Commission of India and the Representation of the People Act, 1951
provides that the organizational structure of the Political Party should
follow the democratic process. The 2nd respondent Political Party has a
Central Executive Committee (Thalamai Kazhaga Seiyarkulu) consisting
of various Members including Co- Ordinator and Joint Co-Ordinator.
(ii) According to the 1st respondent, based on the instructions of the
Co- Ordinator and the Joint Co-Ordinator,             the Executive Committee
takes periodical decisions/resolutions for the smooth administration of
the Party and for executing the Agenda of the 2 nd respondent Political
Party for the decisions/resolutions taken by Central Executive Committee
which will          be placed before the General Council of the Central
Organization (Thalamai Kazhaga Seiyarkulu) of the 2nd respondent.
(iii) The General Council of the Central Organization consist              of
the Chairman, Co-Ordinator, Joint Co-Ordinator, Deputy Co-Ordinators,
Treasurer, Headquarters, Secretaries of the Party, the Members of the
General Council elected from the Districts and other States, the Members
of the Audit Committee, Property Protection Committee and the
Parliamentary Board. The General Council of the Central Organization
always approves the decisions/resolutions taken by the leader of the Party
and those that are passed by the Central Executive Committee and
all such decisions/resolutions are implemented thereafter by the 2 nd
respondent Political Party.           The General Body of the 2 nd respondent
Political Party        was not convened for a long period of time and
functioning of the 2nd respondent Party is being done only by the
decisions/resolutions taken and approved by the             Central Executive
Committee. All the Agendas and decisions have always been deliberated
in the Central Executive Committee with the approval of the Party
leadership and later placed before the General Council of the Central
Organization,         which      automatically     would        approve          the
resolutions/decisions of the       Central Executive Committee.         After the
death of the then General Secretary of the Party, Selvi J.Jayalalithaa on
05.12.2016, the post of General Secretary was abolished and the posts of
Co-Ordinator and Joint Co-Ordinator were created, which were given
absolute power jointly, as per Rule 20(A) of the 2 nd                 respondent
Bye-Laws and the same was passed by the General Council Meeting held
on 12.09.2017.
(iv) According to the 1st respondent, as per Rule 45 of the Bye-
Laws, the Co-Ordinator and Joint Co-Ordinator are fully authorized to
relax or make alterations to any of the aforesaid Rules and Regulations
of the Party. The tenure was also fixed as 5 years in Rule 20A(iii).
Amendments were brought to the Bye-Laws of the 2nd respondent on
12.09.2017 and the Co-Ordinator and Joint Co-Ordinator of the Party
were entrusted with the powers of General Secretary and the said powers
were acted upon by all the parties to the Appeals. Based on the request
of Primary Members of the Party and taking into consideration of the
observations made by this Court in W.P.Nos.10725 of 2017 and 10726
of 2018, the Executive Committee had passed a special resolution for
amending Rule 20(A) Part-ii, Rule 43 and Rule 45 of the Bye-Laws, on
(v) On 05.12.2021, a detailed communication was sent to the
Election Commission of India with regard to the amendments carried out
in the Executive Committee Meeting. On 02.12.2021, the Election for the
posts of Co-Ordinator and Joint Co-Ordinator were notified and for that
purpose two Election Commissioners were appointed by the Party. The
date of Election was fixed as 07.12.2021 and for counting of votes and
declaration of result was fixed on 08.12.2021.       On 06.12.2021, after
completion of the Election process, the Election Commissioners declared
the result of the Election to the posts of Co-Ordinator and Joint Co-
Ordinator, since the 1st respondent and the appellant in O.S.A.No.227 of
2022 were elected as unopposed and necessary certificates were also
issued to the Co-Ordinator and Joint Co-Ordinator, the same has been
communicated to the Election Commission of India on 29.04.2022 in
compliance of Section 29(A) (ix) of the Representation of the People Act,
(vi) According to the 1st respondent, by a notice of invitation
dated 02.06.2022, a General Council Meeting was scheduled to be held
on 23.06.2022.              In the meeting of     District Secretaries held on
14.06.2022 at the 2nd respondent Party Headquarters, a few Members of
the General Council made a demand for Single Leadership and such a
demand created turmoil in the Party. According to the 1 st respondent, the
appellant and the other respondents unilaterally intended to introduce an
Agenda in the General Council Meeting on 23.06.2022 for the Election of
a Single Leader.
(vii) The 1st respondent has also stated that he came to know that
certain Members were planning to introduce a resolution at the General
Council of the Central Organization to that effect. In such circumstances,
a Member of the 2nd respondent Political Party one Mr.Shanmugam (one
of the General Council Members) filed a Civil Suit in C.S.No.111 of
2022 before this Court along with Applications in O.A.Nos.327 and 328
of 2022 for an order of interim injunction restraining the respondents
therein from placing any Agenda in the Meeting of the General Council
of Central Organization to be held on 23.06.2022 or any other date with
respect to the amendment of Rule 20A(i) to (xiii) of the Political Party.
By order dated 22.06.2022, the learned Single Judge rejected the relief
prayed         for by the plaintiff and decided not to interfere with the
proceedings of the Political Party and also permitted the 2nd respondent
to conduct the General Council Meeting on 23.06.2022. Challenging the
order passed, Mr.Shanmugam preferred an appeal in O.S.A.No160 of
2022 on the same day, i.e. 22.06.2022.
(viii)  The 1st respondent has stated that a Draft Resolution
containing 23 items has been sent to the 1 st respondent                    Party
Headquarters for the approval and after perusing the Draft Resolutions,
the 1st respondent in O.S.A.No.227 of 2022 gave consent and approval to
those 23 resolutions to be placed at the General Council Meeting.
According to the 1st respondent, the Draft Resolution was not provided to
any of the Members of the General Council and they were kept in the
dark about other Agendas/Resolutions that were going to be placed before
the General Council on 23.06.2022.
(ix) The Division Bench of this Court, by order dated 23.06.2022,
permitted the respondents 4 and 5 therein to convene the General Council
Meeting at 10.00 a.m. on 23.06.2022 and also permitted the General
Council         to discuss and take any decision as per the Rules and Bye-
Laws with regard to the 23 items mentioned in the Draft Resolution and
also made it clear that the respondents therein shall not take any decision
other than the 23 items mentioned in the Draft Resolution. Further, the
Division Bench gave liberty to the Members of the General Council to
discuss any other matter, however, no decision be taken in the General
Council Meeting with regard to the same.
(x) In violation of the order passed by the Division bench, in the
General Council Meeting held on 23.06.2022, the 23 items mentioned in
the Draft Resolution were mischievously altered and              rejected by the
General Council and introduced a New Resolution bereft of the
authorization of Co-Ordinator and           Joint Co-Ordinator of the Party,
appointing the 5th respondent in O.S.A.No.227 of 222 as a Permanent
Presidium Chairman. Without the consent of the                Co-Ordinator and
Joint Co-Ordinator, the 5th respondent was unlawfully appointed as the
Presidium Chairman. Further, it was orally announced that the General
Council Meeting will be held on 11.07.2022, which is against Rule
20A(v) of the Bye-Laws of the Party.             The very calling of another
General Council Meeting on 11.07.2022 is to circumvent the order of the
Division Bench and to clandestinely and undemocratically take decisions
to alter the structure of the Party.
(xi) The 1st respondent further stated that without the consent of
the Co-Ordinator and Joint Co-Ordinator, a notice was circulated on
26.06.2022 allegedly issued by the Party Headquarters Secretary, stating
that as per the request of the Headquarters' Office Bearers, there will be a
Meeting on 27.06.2022 at 10 a.m. in the M.G.R. Maaligai, Head Office
and all are requested to participate. As per Rule 20A(v) of the Bye-Laws
of the AIADMK Party, the Co-Ordinator and Joint Co-Ordinator shall
be responsible for the entire administration of the Party. Therefore, only
with the consent of the Co-Ordinator and the Joint Co-Ordinator of the
Party, any    Meeting can be convened.          Notice of invitation dated
26.06.2022 to attend the meeting on 27.06.2022 was neither signed nor
authorised by both the Co-Ordinator and Joint Co-Ordinator and it is
against the Rule 20A(v) of the         Bye-Laws of the Party.             The 1st
respondent issued a statement raising his objections to the aforesaid
meeting and notified that no Members          are bound to act upon the
decisions taken at the unlawful meeting held on 27.06.2022. As per Rule
26 of the Bye-Laws of the Party, the Party Headquarters' Secretary has
no power to convene any meeting.             The respondents have been
deliberately attempting to convene the illegal meeting on 11.07.2022 to
alter the Bye-Laws of the 2nd respondent.        The 1st respondent further
contended that     the Co-Ordinator and      Joint Co-Ordinator alone are
authorized to convene the meeting of the General Council and Executive
Council.     However, if 1/5th of the Members of the General Council
request the Co-Ordinator and Joint Co-Ordinator to convene the Special
Meeting, it is obligatory on the part of the Co-Ordinator and Joint Co-
Ordinator to do so within 30 days of the receipt of such a requisition. No
other Office Bearer or Member of the General Council is vested with the
power to convene the meeting even in the absence of the Co-Ordinator
and Joint Co-Ordinator.
(xii) On 04.07.2022, the 1st respondent in O.S.A.No.227 of 2022,
was served with a notice dated 01.07.2022. Further, in the notice it has
been stated that        the amendment made to the Party Bye-Laws on
01.12.2021 were not approved by the            Co-Ordinator and         Joint Co-
Ordinator in the General Council Meeting held on 23.06.2022, therefore,
the Co-Ordinator and Joint Co-Ordinator cannot function forthwith and
that the 6th respondent now assumes power by virtue of Rule 20A(vii) of
the Party Bye-Laws.            According to the 1st respondent,            the 23
Resolutions, which were to be placed before the General Council, served
on him on the date of General Council Meeting i.e. 23.06.2022, did not
even include a Resolution to approve the amendments to the Bye-Laws
passed in the Executive Committee Meeting dated 01.12.2021. Even
assuming         without admitting that the   Co-Ordinator and          Joint Co-
Ordinator cannot function forthwith as alleged, the 6 th respondent, by
virtue of Rule 20A(vii), is only permitted to hold office and continue to
function till the new Co-Ordinator and Joint Co-Ordinator are elected
and assume office.       The notice issued by the 6 th respondent is illegal.
As per Rule 19(vii), it is only the Co-Ordinator and Joint Co-Ordinator,
who are vested with the power to convene the Special Meeting based on
requisition.      Neither under Rule 19 nor under Rule 20A, there is any
provision to convene the meeting by any person other than the Co-
Ordinator and Joint Co-Ordinator of the Party. Even in the absence of
the Co-Ordinator and Joint Co-Ordinator, no other Office Bearer or
Member of the General Council is vested with the power to convene the
(xii) The convening of      the General Council Meeting              on
11.07.2022 is ultra vires the Bye-Laws of the 2nd respondent Party.
Therefore, there is prima facie case in favour of the 1st respondent and if
the said meeting is convened on 11.07.2022, the appellant and the other
respondents can very well disrupt the very basic structure of the Political
Party that has been functioning over several decades. In the event of such
illegal and undemocratic amendments taking place, irreparable loss shall
occur and the same can never be compensated in terms of money. If the
said General Council meeting is allowed to be conducted on 11.07.2022,
no prejudice shall be caused to the other parties, since it is not as if the
1st respondent is seeking for an abolishment of the General Council.
Therefore, according to the 1st respondent, balance of convenience is very
well in his favour, hence, sought for the prayers as mentioned above.
10. The brief case of the appellant is as follows:-
(i) According to the appellant, he was elected as Interim General
Secretary of the AIADMK at its General Council Meeting held on
11.07.2022. Selvi J.Jayalalithaa was elected as General Secretary of the
2nd respondent Party on 31.12.2015 and prior to that the Office Bearers of
the Party Headquarters were appointed by Selvi J.Jayalalithaa                        on
05.12.2015         for a period of five years, which was due to expire on
02.12.2019.         Due to the death of the then General Secretary on
05.12.2016, Mrs.V.K.Sasikala was appointed as the Interim General
Secretary at the General Council Meeting that was convened by the
Office Bearers of the Headquarters under Rule 20(v) of the Rules and
Regulations of the Party on 29.12.2016            till the General Secretary is
elected in accordance with the Bye-Laws of the Party. Thereafter, there
was a split in the AIADMK Party, wherein several disputes as to the
allotment of the reserved symbol of “Two Leaves” arose and in the light
of the same, necessary proceedings under paragraph 15 of the Election
Symbol (Reservation and Allotment) Order, 1968 was filed before the
Election Commission of India on 16.03.2017 by Mr.E.Madhusudanan
(since deceased),          Mr.S.Semmalai and      the 1st respondent in
O.S.A.No.227 of 2022.         The Election Commission of India, by order
dated 21.03.2017, freezed the symbol and thename of the Party, directing
the groups to choose other symbols for the ensuring by-elections to the
Dr.Radhakrishnan Nagar Assembly Constituency. Accordingly, it was
solely for the purpose of contesting elections, the two groups came to be
identified as AIADMK (Amma) and AIADMK (Puratchi Thalaivi
(ii) In the mean time, on 14.12.2017, the then Interim General
Secretary         was convicted in a criminal case and had to undergo
imprisonment, as a result of which, there was an inability on the part of
the Interim General Secretary to perform her functioning of                   the
administration of the Party.   Thereafter, two groups, one led by the 1 st
respondent and the other led by the appellant decided to unite until and
the two groups came together to conduct the General Council Meeting of
the Party. The notice dated 29.08.2017 was issued by the Office Bearers
of the Headquarters      of the AIADMK, inviting the Members for a
General Council Meeting to be held on 12.09.2017. Even though the
notice was shown to be issued by the two groups, there was no doubt that
the meeting was that of the AIADMK Party inasmuch as it happened as
per the Bye-Laws of the Party as per the requisition received from over
1/5th of the Members under Rule 19(vii) of the Bye-Laws. The General
Council Meeting of the Party was conducted with the Members, who
were in the General Council as on 05.12.2016. The Meeting was called
for by the Office Bearers of the Party, as there was a situation where the
then Interim General Secretary could not function.         At the Meeting,
several resolutions were passed including the post of General Secretary
was abolished and the posts of Co-Ordinator and Joint Co-Ordinator
were created and the 1st respondent and the appellant                       were
appointed as Co-Ordinator and Joint Co-Ordinator respectively. As per
the resolution, the Co-Ordinator and Joint Co-Ordinator               were to be
elected by the General Council.
(iii) On 23.11.2017, the Election Commission of India passed final
orders holding that the groups led by the 1st respondent and the appellant
are the real AIADMK Party and held that they are entitled to the reserved
“Two Leaves Symbol”. On 28.02.2019, the Delhi High Court, dismissed
the Writ Petitions challenging the said order.           On 26.03.2019, the
Supreme Court dismissed the appeals filed against the order of the
Delhi High Court and on 23.04.2020, the Review Petition field in the said
Special Leave Petition was also dismissed, thereby rendering a finality to
the order of the Election Commission of India. Based on the test of
majority, the Intra Party Elections to the various posts including the post
of Co-Ordinator and Joint Co-Ordinator had to be conducted before 2019
at the end of tenure of five years from the Election of earlier Office
Bearers in 2014-2019. The Party addressed several communications to
the Election Commission of India between 2019 and 2021 seeking for
extensions to conduct Intra party Elections.      The Election Commission
of India fixed a deadline on 31.12.2021 to conduct Intra Party Elections,
the Executive Council of the Party, which does not have any power of
amendment of Bye-Laws, a power which is only with the General Council
as per Rule 43, proceeded to pass certain amendments on 01.12.2021 to
the Bye-Laws to the effect that the Co-Ordinator and Joint Co-Ordinator
would be elected on a Single Vote jointly by the Primary Members of the
Party. Since it was only the General Council that had the powers to
amend the Bye-Laws as per Rule 43, the Executive Council had
specifically resolved to place the amendments before the General Council
for its approval. Even on these amendments on 01.12.2021, the elections
to the posts of Co-Ordinator and Joint Co-Ordinator were announced and
the appellant and the 1st respondent were elected unanimously on
06.12.2021. By March 2022, all the elections to the Intra Party Posts
were concluded and as a result of the said elections, the Members of the
General Council were elected and a General Council was formed. The
elections to the other posts in the General Council were conducted as per
the original Bye-Laws and the persons were elected as provided under
Rules 6 to 14 of the Bye-Laws. However, the election to the post of Co-
Ordinator and Joint Co-Ordinator       is subject to the approval of the
amendment to the Bye-laws by the General Council.
(iv) The General Council Meeting of the Party was called for on
23.06.2022 by issuing a notice dated 02.06.2022 jointly issued by the
appellant and the 1st respondent without specifying any Agenda, as has
always been the practice of the Party. In view of the scheduled General
Council Meeting, the District Secretaries of the Party met on 14.06.2022
at the Party Headquarters to discuss various issues that would be taken
up at the General Council Meeting on 23.06.2022, including the issue of
unitary/single leadership by abolishing the dual posts of Co-Ordinator
and Joint Co-Ordinator. The dispute between the 1st respondent and the
appellant started on 19.06.2022 when the 1st respondent addressed a
letter to the appellant suggesting to postpone the General Council
Meeting, to which, the appellant, by letter dated 20.06.2022, refused to
agree to the suggestion of the 1st respondent. Since the Party had decided
to proceed with the General Council Meeting on 23.06.2022, the Party
sought for a police protection at the venue of the General Council Meeting
and accordingly, this Court directed to grant Police Protection to the
General Council Meeting. The 1st respondent wrote to the Commissioner
of Police, Avadi, seeking for cancellation of the Meeting on 23.06.2022
(v) Since the efforts of the 1st respondent to thwart the General
Council Meeting went in vain, the 1st respondent, through another
Member of the General Council, filed a Civil Suit in C.S.No.111 of 2022
before this Court on 22.06.2022 and sought for an interim injunction
against the conduct of the Meeting on 23.06.2022. The learned Single
Judge of this Court refused to grant any injunction in favour of the
plaintiff therein and the plaintiff therein filed an Original Side Appeal on
22.06.2022        and invited an order from the Division Bench                    on
23.06.2022, by which, the Division Bench granted an order of injunction
as against taking decision on any resolution apart from the alleged 23
Draft Resolutions approved by the Co-Ordinator,             but permitted the
meeting to go ahead and also specifically held that there could be any
discussion but no decision taken. The 23 Resolutions that were placed
were rejected and in any case, the amendments that were made on
01.12.2021 were not approved by the General Council.                    Thus, the
amendment to the Bye-Laws made on 01.12.2021 stood lapsed and
thereby the Co-Ordinator and Joint Co-Ordinator, who were elected based
on the amendment also could not continue to act.
(vi) During the General Council Meeting on 23.06.2022,            2190
Members out of the total 2665 Members of the General Council gave a
written requisition for a General Meeting to discuss and pass Resolutions
on the Single Leadership and requested a date for General Council
Meeting to be fixed.        The requisition letter  dated 23.06.2022 was
addressed to the Presidium Chairman,            the appellant and the 1 st
respondent, on the floor of the General Council and thus, everybody had
valid notice and knowledge regarding the Meeting to be held on
11.07.2022. The date of the next General Council Meeting was fixed on
11.07.2022 at 9.15 a.m. and the same was announced at the Meeting by
the Presidium Chairman.         Thereafter, on 24.06.2022, 2432 General
Council Members circulated the Agenda for the meeting to be held on
11.07.2022, which included the issue of introducing Single Leadership by
abolishing the posts of Co-Ordinator and Joint Co-Ordinator . Based on
the Draft Agenda proposed by the 2432 General Council Members, an
invitation dated 01.07.2022 for the Meeting on 11.07.2022 was issued by
the Office Bearers in the same manner as the meeting on 12.09.2017.
The invitation was sent to all the Members, who attended the meeting on
(vii) The appellant further stated that the Hon'ble Supreme Court
vide its order dated 06.07.2022, in S.L.P.(C) No.11237 of 2022, stayed
the operation of the order of the Division Bench of this Court made in
C.M.P. No.9962 of 2022 in O.S.A.No.160 of 2022, dated 23.06.2022.
The Hon'ble Supreme Court has stayed              that the order of the Division
Bench that had placed restrictions on the Agenda to be discussed in the
General Council Meeting on 23.06.2022. Further the Hon'ble Supreme
court also permitted the General Council Meeting on 11.07.2022 to
proceed in accordance with law.
(viii) The appellant stated that the 1st respondent filed the present
suit seeking         for an order of      injunction against the Meeting on
11.07.2022. By order dated 11.07.2022, the learned Single Judge,
dismissed the applications. On 11.07.2022 at about 09.15 a.m., the 1 st
respondent attacked the Party Headquarters with his men and broke open
the door, robbed vital documents from the Headquarters and ransacked
the entire premises. The Revenue Authorities initiated procedure under
Sections 145 & 146 of the CrPC. This Court quashed the proceedings
under Sections 145 and 146 vide order dated 21.07.2022 and handed
over the possession of the Party Headquarters to the appellant.               On
11.07.2022 at the General Council Meeting, which was attended by
2460 Members, it was resolved to abolish the Dual Leadership and
Single Leadership under General Secretary was introduced and post of
Interim General Secretary was created. The appellant was elected as the
Interim General Secretary. The election for the post of General Secretary
would be conducted within a month and         the Election Officers were
appointed. The 1st respondent/plaintiff was removed from all Party
posts and Primary Membership of the Party and a new Treasurer was
appointed in the Meeting. The Resolutions passed in the meeting was
implemented with the banks recognizing the Treasurer and the
Resolutions being intimated to the Election Commission of India. Out of
the 2665 Members of the General Council, 2539 Members supported the
Resolutions passed at the General Council. The Members, who attended
the General Council Meeting and other Members, who supported all the
Resolutions at the General Council Meeting, filed affidavits before the
Election Commission of India in support of their statements.
(ix) As against the order passed by the learned Single Judge in
O.A.Nos. 368, 370 and 379 of 2022, the 1st respondent in O.S.A.No.227
of 2022 and the 1st respondent in O.S.A.Nos. 231 and 232 of 2022,
preferred a Special Leave Petition before the Hon'ble Supreme Court The
Apex Court, by its order dated 29.07.2022, directed this Court to
reconsider the matter afresh without being influenced by the Orders of
the Hon'ble Supreme Court dated            06.07.2022 and 29.07.2022 and
remitted the applications to the learned Single Judge for reconsideration.
11. After remand, the learned Single Judge,               taking into
consideration       the case of both the parties disposed of the Original
Applications in O.A.Nos. 368, 370 and 379 of 2022 with the following
(i)There shall be an order of status quo

(v)The General Council meeting, on such
requisition shall be convened within 30 days
from the date of receipt of the requisition and it

(vi)In case, the Co-ordinator and the Joint
Co-ordinator are of the opinion that, for any
reason     further   direction   is required      for

meeting, it is open for them to approach this
Court and seek necessary relief.

A.K.Sriram, learned counsel appearing for the 1st respondent in

respondent in          O.S.A.No.227 of 2022 and Mr.S.R.Rajagopal                    &
Mrs.Narmadha Sampath, learned counsels appearing for the respondents
6 in O.S.A.No.227 of 2022 and 5 in O.S.A.Nos. 231 and 232 of 2022.
13.1   The learned Senior Counsels appearing for the appellant
made the following submissions:-
(i) The suit filed by the 1st respondent in O.S.A.No.227 of 2022
ought to have been dismissed by the learned Single Judge for the sole
reason that the plaint suffered from the vice of non-joinder and mis-
joinder of the necessary parties.       When the 1st respondent had claimed
to have filed the suit in his capacity as Co-ordinator/Treasurer of the
AIADMK Party, yet to avoid proper representation for the defendants he
has arrayed the AIADMK Party, its General Council and its Executive
Council all being represented by Co-Ordinator and Joint Co-Ordinator.
Therefore, the 1st respondent could not have sued and be sued in the very
same suit.
(ii) As per rule 43 of the Bye-Laws of the Party, the amendments
to the Rules and Regulations can be carried out only by the General
Council of the Party. Thus, the Party Constitution clearly stipulates that
the General council is the supreme body of the Party.
1. On 01.12.2021, the amendments to manner of election of Co-
Ordinator and Joint Co-Ordinator were proposed by the Executive
Council and the amendment specifically stated that the election to
the post of Co-Ordinator and Joint Co-Ordinator would be done
“Jointly” on “Single Vote” by the “Primary Members”. Further, it
was specifically resolved at the Executive Committee Meeting that
these Resolutions will be placed for approval at the next General
Council Meeting. The elections that happened to the posts
thereafter was also based on this proposed amendment. The next
immediate General Council Meeting that was called for after the
01.12.2021 Executive Committee Meeting was on 23.06.2022,
which should have approved the amendments of the Executive
Council and the election to the post of Co-Ordinator and Joint Co-
Ordinator.      However, at the meeting on 23.06.2022, the
amendments were not ratified, hence,        the amendments            have
lapsed.   Since the Executive Committee had no jurisdiction to
amend the Bye-Laws, the non-ratification of election to the posts of
Co-Ordinator and Joint Co-Ordinator have become lapsed.
(iv) The order of the learned Single Judge is perverse for the reason
that the learned Single Judge has ignored the submissions put-forth on
behalf of the appellant that the General Council alone has the power to
(v) As per Rule 20A(vii), when the position of the Co-Ordinator
and Joint Co-Ordinator falls vacant, until there is election to the said
posts, the Office Bearers appointed by the previous Co-Ordinator and
Joint Co-Ordinator shall carry forward the activities of the Party.
Therefore, there is no vaccum for the manner of functioning of the Party.
(vi) The finding of the learned Single Judge that the notice for the
General Council Meeting scheduled to be held on 11.07.2022 did not
conform to the Bye-Laws of the Party and that there was no advance
notice of 15 days as contemplated under the Bye-Laws is not correct for
the reason that the learned Single Judge has misconstrued the invitation
issued on 01.07.2022 by the Office Bearers of the Headquarters as a
“notice” for convening the General Council Meeting and has proceeded to
hold that the said notice was issued within 15 days from the meeting. As
per Rule 19(vii) of the Bye-Laws, the requirement of 15 days of advance
notice is only for a regular General Council Meeting, that is annually
convened from time to time, by the Co-Ordinator and Joint Co-Ordinator.
Whereas, the present meeting on 11.07.2022, was a Special General
Council Meeting, based on the requisition of more than 1/5th of the
Members of the General Council.            Rule 19(vii) does not require an
advance notice of 15 days, much less a written notice for the convening of
the meeting.         Rule 19(vii)    contains two parts, clearly demarcating
between a regular General Council Meeting convened by Co-Ordinator
and Joint Co-Ordinator and a Special General Council Meeting based on
requisition of 1/5th of Members. The learned Single Judge has proceeded
to construe the entire Rule 19(vii) as one single Bye-Law and applied
the requirements under the first part in relation to the requirement of 15
days notice, to the second part as well. The Bye-Laws does not require a
written notice of 15 days. In the absence of any specific procedure, even
a public advertisement is sufficient to be a valid notice.
(vii) As per Rule 19(vii) the requisition had to be made only by
1/5th of the Members i..e 533 Members. Whereas, in the meeting held on
23.06.2022, 2190 Members             have requested to conduct the General
Council Meeting on 11.07.2022.          Though some of the signatures in the
2190 requisition are dated as 20.06.2022, the fact remains that                   the
requisition letter of 2190 members were submitted on 23.06.2022 and as
such, the requisition for General Council Meeting is valid.            The date
mentioned along with the signatures will not gain much significance
when the requisition is made and the same is submitted on the floor of the
General Council on 23.06.2022. Not even a single person had claimed
that no such requisition was made.        Even the 1st respondent do not
claim that there was no requisition. The requisition was followed by
agenda that was circulated by 2432 members. Thereafter, in the General
Council Meeting on 11.07.2022, 2460 Members attended the meeting
and subsequently over 2539 persons have signed and filed affidavits in
the Election Commission of India that they are in favour of the resolutions
at the General Council. When the 1st respondent himself has not pleaded
about the hand written portion of the letter submitted on behalf of the
2190 members, the learned Single Judge ought not have given a finding
with regard to the same at the interlocutory stage. Since the then General
Secretary Selvi J Jayalaithaa had expired on 05.12.2016 and the Interim
General Secretary was in incarceration, the General Council Meeting
could not be conducted in the year 2017. In these circumstances, the
Office Bearers issued invitation for conducting the General Council
Meeting on 12.09.2017. In the present situation, the Co-Ordinator and
Joint Co-Ordinator are unable to convene the meeting jointly, hence,
calling for meeting by the Party Office Bearers is proper.
(viii) Since the Bye-Laws nowhere contemplate a written notice,
the requisition placed by 82% of the General Council Members under
Rule 19(vii) of the Rules and Regulations of the Party on 23.06.2022
itself would be sufficient notice for the General Council Meeting on
11.07.2022 and as such, the 1st respondent was well aware of the same.
The 1st respondent, who was present in the meeting in 23.06.2022, had
notice and knowledge of the General Council Meeting proposed to be
held on 11.07.2022, hence, he could not have complained of lack of
proper notice whatsoever. The 1st respondent had sufficient knowledge
regarding the General Council Meeting to be held on 11.07.2022 and
had also admitted in the cause of action paragraph in the plaint at
paragraph 40. The 1st respodnent had constructive notice of the General
Council Meeting on 11.07.2022 even as early as on 23.06.2022 when the
previous General Council Meeting was convened.
(ix) At the interlocutory stage, the impugned order          has been
rendered with conclusive findings as though a full-fledged trial has been
conducted and deposition of the witnesses have been recorded. The
impugned order is beyond the scope of the Original Application and has
granted several reliefs in favour of the 1st respondent in the absence of
any specific pleading on the part of the 1st respondent. Hence, the order
is perverse and unsustainable.
(x) The impugned order is unsustainable in law inasmuch as it has
passed an order against the conduct of General Council Meeting dated
11.07.2022 when the same has already taken place. The learned Single
Judge could not have granted an order of status quo ante in the present
application, when the relief itself was only limited to a temporary
injunction       restraining the respondents from conducting a General
Council Meeting on 11.07.2022. By granting an order of staus quo ante
as on 23.06.2022, the impugned order has virtually interfered with the
decisions taken in the General Council Meetings on 23.06.2022 and
11.07.2022 and the same is directly in contravention of the order of the
Hon'ble Supreme Court dated 06.07.2022 in S.L.P.(C) No.11237 of
2022, granting an order of stay in respect of the order of the Division
Bench of this Court made in C.M.P No.9962 of 2022 in O.S.A.No.160 of
2022, dated 23.06.2022.             The impugned order has              completely
disregarded the order of the Hon'ble Supreme Court dated 06.07.2022,
which has passed an order in respect of the General Council Meeting
dated 23.06.2022 and has proceeded to grant an order of status quo ante
as on 23.06.2022. The relief sought for in the Original Application has
already become infructuous as on the date of               the hearing of the
application and that the 1st respondent had not sought for any amendment
of any relief or had filed a fresh Application.
(xi) The order of status quo ante as on 23.06.2022 by holding that
there shall be no Executive or General Council Meeting without joint
consent of the appellant and the 1st respondent is liable to be set side,
since it traverse beyond the scope of the Original Application as well as
the main suit and         as such the same is unsustainable in law.              The
Resolution passed at the meeting on 11.07.2022, have been fully acted
upon and at an interim stage, there was absolutely no material on record
to arrive at such findings. When the order itself recognizes that the
appellant and the 1st respondent could not work together and having held
so, to hold at an interim stage that they have to jointly call for the
meeting, would result in stifling the activities of the Party. There is no
prima facie case, balance of convenience and irreparable injury in favour
of the 1st respondent for granting an order in his favour.
13.2 The learned Senior Counsels appearing for the appellant,
in support of their contentions,                  has    relied upon the following
(i) (1990) 2 SCC 117 [Dorab Cawasji Warden v. Coomi Sorab
Warden, wherein the Hon'ble Supreme Court held as follows:-
“ ...... 19. In order to attract the second paragraph of
this section the subject matter of the transfer has to be a
dwelling house belonging to an undivided family and the
transfer is a share in the same to a person who is not a
member of the family. Therefore, in order to satisfy the
first ingredient of clear existence of the right and its
infringement, the plaintiff will have to show a probable
case that the suit property is a dwelling house and it
belonged to an undivided family. In other words, on the
facts before the court there is a strong probability of the
plaintiff getting the relief prayed for by him in the suit. On
the second and third ingredients having regard to the
restriction on the rights of a transferee for joint possession
and the dominant purpose of the second paragraph of
Section 44 of the Act, there is danger of an injury or
violation of the corresponding rights of the other members
of the family and an irreparable harm to the plaintiff and
the court's interference is necessary to protect the interest
of the plaintiff. Since the relief of an interim injunction is
all the same an equitable relief the court shall also consider
whether the comparative mischief or inconvenience which
is likely to ensue from withholding the injunction will be
greater than that which is likely to arise from granting it,
which means that the balance of convenience is in favour
of the plaintiff.
20. The first point that has to be considered,
therefore, is whether one can have a reasonably certain
view at this stage before the actual trial that the suit
property is a ‘dwelling house belonging to an undivided
family’ within the meaning of Section 44 of the Act. As to
what is the meaning of these words in the section, the
leading case is the one decided by the Full Bench of the
Allahabad High Court in Sultan Begam v. Debi
That was concerned with the meaning of the phrase
“dwelling house belonging to an undivided family” in
Section 4 of the Partition Act, 1893. That section provides
that where a share of a dwelling house belonging to an
undivided family has been transferred to a person who is
not a member of such family and such transferee sues for
partition, the court shall, if any member of the family,
being a shareholder shall undertake to buy the share of
such transferee make a valuation of such share in such
manner as it thinks fit and direct the sale of such share to
such shareholder. The argument was that the words
‘undivided family’ as used in the section mean a joint
family and are confined to Hindus or to Muhammadans,
who have adopted the Hindu rule as to joint family
property. The counter-argument was that the expression is
of general application and means a family whether Hindu,
Muhammadan, Christian etc. possessed of a dwelling
house which has not been divided or partitioned among the
members of the family. The case itself related to a Muslim
family to whom the house belonged. The Full Bench
“...in it (Section 4 of the Partition Act) we find
nothing to indicate that it was intended to apply to
any limited class of the community. The words
‘undivided family’ as used in this section appear to
be borrowed from Section 44 of the Transfer of
Property Act. The last clause of that section
prescribes that where the transferee of a share of a
dwelling house belonging to an undivided family is
not a member of the family, nothing in this section
shall be deemed to entitle him to joint possession or
other common or part enjoyment of the dwelling
house. This provision of the statute is clearly of
general application, and the effect of it is to compel
the transferee of a dwelling house belonging to an
undivided family, who is a stranger to the family, to
enforce his rights in regard to such share by
partition. There appears to me to be no reason why
the words ‘undivided family’ as used in Section 4 of
the Partition Act, should have a narrower meaning
that they have in Section 44 of the Transfer of
Property Act. If the legislature intended that Section
4 should have limited operation, we should expect to
find some indication of this in the language of the
section. For example, instead of the words ‘undivided
family’ the expression ‘undivided Hindu family’ or
‘joint family’ might have been used.”
With reference to the object and purpose of such a
provision the Full Bench further observed:
“...as was pointed out by Mr Wells, Judicial
Commissioner,          in    the      case       of Kalka
Parshad v. Bankey Lall [(1906) 9 Oudh Cases 158]
is to prevent a transferee of a member of a family
who is an outsider from forcing his way into a
dwelling house in which other members of his
transferor's family have a right to live, and that the
words ‘undivided family’ must be taken to mean
‘undivided qua the dwelling house in question, and to
be a family which owns the house but has not
divided it’.”
21. Again in construing the words “family” and
‘undivided family’ a Division Bench of the Calcutta High
Court in Khirode Chandra Ghoshal v. Saroda Prosad
Mitra [(1910) 7 IC 436: 9 MLT 117] , observed:
“The word ‘family’, as used in the Partition
Act, ought to be given a liberal and comprehensive
meaning, and it does include a group of persons
related in blood, who live in one house or under
one head or management. There is nothing in the
Partition Act to support the suggestion that the
term ‘family’ was intended to be used in a very
narrow and restricted sense, namely, a body of
persons who can trace their descent from a
common ancestor.”
Bhattacharjya v. Kamakshya Charan Bhatta- charjya
[AIR 1928 Cal 539: 109 IC 67] , related to a case of a
group of persons who were not the male descendants of the
common ancestor to whom the property in the suit
originally belonged but were respectively the sons of the
daughter of a grandson of the common ancestor and the
sons of a daughter of a son of the said common ancestor.
The learned Judge applied the principle enunciated
in Sultan Begam v. Debi Prasad [1908 ILR 30 All 324: 5
ALJ 352: 1 MLT 38] to this family and held that it was an
undivided family since the house had not been divided by
metes and bounds among themselves. The Madras High
Court also followed and applied the ratio of this judgment
in      the      decision      in Sivaramayya       v. Venkata
593] . The next decision to be noted is the one reported
in Bhim Singh v. Ratnakar Singh [AIR 1971 Ori 198:
(1970) 1 Cut WR 183] . In that case the undivided family
consisted of the plaintiff and the defendants 1 and 2
therein. Defendant 1 had alienated 1/3 of his half share in
the house property in favour of defendants 7 and 10 who
were the appellants before the High Court. The suit was
filed for a permanent injunction restraining defendants 7
and 10 from jointly possessing the disputed house along
with the plaintiff and defendant 2. The facts as found by
the courts were that by an amicable arrangement among
plaintiff and defendants 1 and 2 they were living separately
for a long time, had separated their residences and were
living in different houses unconnected with each other but
all situate in one homestead and that after defendant 1 had
alienated his separate interest as well as his separate house
in favour of the alienees and in pursuance thereof the
alienees were put in possession. After referring to the
judgments we have quoted above and following the
principles therein, Ranganath Misra, J. as he then was
held: (AIR p. 201, para 21)
“If in this state of things, a member of the family
transfers his share in the dwelling house to a stranger
paragraph 2 of Section 44 of the Transfer of Property
Act comes into play and the transferee does not
become entitled to joint possession or any joint
enjoyment of the dwelling house although he would
have the right to enforce a partition of his share. The
object of the provision in Section 44 is to prevent the
intrusion of the strangers into the family residence
which is allowed to be possessed and enjoyed by the
members of the family alone in spite of the transfer of
a share therein in favour of a stranger. The factual
position as has been determined is that the property is
still an undivided dwelling house, possession and
enjoyment whereof are confined to the members of
the family. The stranger-transferees being debarred
by law from exercising right of joint possession which
is one of the main incidences of co-ownership of the
property should be kept out.”
On the question whether the enjoyment of ascertained
separate portions of the common dwelling house and the
alienee taking possession made any difference the learned
Judge quoted the following passage from Udayanath
Sahu v. Ratnakar Bej [AIR 1967 Ori 139: 33 Cut LT 1163]
“If the transferee (stranger) get into possession of
a share in the dwelling house, the possession
becomes a joint possession and is illegal. Courts
cannot countenance or foster illegal possession. The
possession of the defendant-transferee in such a case
becomes illegal. Plaintiff's co-owners are entitled to
get a decree for eviction or even for injunction where
the transferee threatens to get possession by force. If
there had been a finding that there was severance of
joint status but no partition by metes and bounds,
defendant 1 was liable to be evicted from the
residential houses and Bari under Section 44 of the
The learned Judge further held: (AIR p. 202, para 23)
“The last contention of Mr Pal is that the plaintiff sued
for injunction only. The learned trial Judge, however, has
decreed ejectment of the transferee defendants and that
decree has been upheld. Once it is held that the plaintiff is
entitled to protection under the second part of Section 44 of
the Transfer of Property Act and the stranger purchasers
are liable to be restrained, it would follow that even if the
defendants have been put in possession or have come
jointly to possess they can be kept out by injunction. The
effect of that injunction would necessarily mean ejectment.
In that sense and to the said extent, the decree of the trial
court upheld by the lower appellate court must be taken to
be sustainable. The remedy of the stranger purchaser is
actually one of partition. Until then, he is obliged to keep
out from asserting joint possession.”
23. We may respectfully state that this is a correct
statement of the law. There could be no doubt that the ratio
of the decisions rendered under Section 4 of the Partition
Act equally apply to the interpretation of the second
paragraph of Section 44 as the provisions are
complementary to each other and the terms “undivided
family” and “dwelling house” have the same meaning in
both the sections. .........”
(ii) (2018) 17 SCC 203          [Samir Narain Bhojwani v. Aurora
Properties & Investments,]wherein the Hon'ble Supreme Court held as
“.........24. That apart, the learned Single Judge as
well as the Division Bench have committed fundamental
error in applying the principle of moulding of relief which
could at best be resorted to at the time of consideration of
final relief in the main suit and not at an interlocutory stage.
The nature of order passed against the appellant is
undeniably a mandatory order at an interlocutory stage.
There is marked distinction between moulding of relief and
granting mandatory relief at an interlocutory stage. As
regards the latter, that can be granted only to restore the
status quo and not to establish a new set of things differing
from the state which existed at the date when the suit was
instituted. This Court in Dorab Cawasji Warden v. Coomi
Sorab Warden [Dorab Cawasji Warden v. Coomi Sorab
Warden, (1990) 2 SCC 117] , has had occasion to consider
the circumstances warranting grant of interlocutory
mandatory injunction. In paras 16 & 17, after analysing the
legal precedents on the point as noticed in paras 11-15, the
Court went on to observe as follows: (SCC pp. 126-27)
“16. The relief of interlocutory mandatory
injunctions are thus granted generally to preserve
or restore the status quo of the last non-contested
status which preceded the pending controversy
until the final hearing when full relief may be
granted or to compel the undoing of those acts that
have been illegally done or the restoration of that
which was wrongfully taken from the party
complaining. But since the granting of such an
injunction to a party who fails or would fail to
establish his right at the trial may cause great
injustice or irreparable harm to the party against
whom it was granted or alternatively not granting of
it to a party who succeeds or would succeed may
equally cause great injustice or irreparable harm,
courts have evolved certain guidelines. Generally
stated these guidelines are:
(1) The plaintiff has a strong case for trial. That is, it
shall be of a higher standard than a prima facie case
that is normally required for a prohibitory injunction.
(2) It is necessary to prevent irreparable or serious
injury which normally cannot be compensated in
terms of money.
(3) The balance of convenience is in favour of the
one seeking such relief.
17. Being essentially an equitable relief the grant or
refusal of an interlocutory mandatory injunction shall
ultimately rest in the sound judicial discretion of the
court to be exercised in the light of the facts and
circumstances in each case. Though the above
guidelines are neither exhaustive nor complete or
absolute rules, and there may be exceptional
circumstances needing action, applying them as
prerequisite for the grant or refusal of such
injunctions would be a sound exercise of a judicial
discretion.”
26. The principle expounded in this decision has been
consistently followed by this Court. It is well established
that an interim mandatory injunction is not a remedy that is
easily granted. It is an order that is passed only in
circumstances which are clear and the prima facie material
clearly justify a finding that the status quo has been altered
by one of the parties to the litigation and the interests of
justice demanded that the status quo ante be restored by
way of an interim mandatory injunction. [See Metro
Marins v. Bonus         Watch      Co.     (P)       Ltd. [Metro
Marins v. Bonus Watch Co. (P) Ltd., (2004) 7 SCC 478]
, Kishore          Kumar      Khaitan v. Praveen           Kumar
Singh [Kishore Kumar Khaitan v. Praveen Kumar Singh,

Raheja v. Shrichand        Vishandas      Raheja [Purshottam
Vishandas Raheja v. Shrichand Vishandas Raheja, (2011)
29. Resultantly, the invocation of principle of moulding
of reliefs so also the exercise of power to grant mandatory
order at an interlocutory stage, is manifestly wrong. To put
it differently, while analysing the merits of the contentions
the High Court was swayed away by the consent
agreement between the respondents inter partes to which
the appellant was not a party. Thus, he could not be bound
by the arrangement agreed upon between the respondents
inter se. The appellant would be bound only by the
Agreement entered with Respondent 2 dated 10-3-2003
and at best the Tripartite Agreement dated 11-9-2009.
Respondent 2 having failed to discharge its obligation
under the stated Agreement dated 10-3-2003, cannot be
permitted to take advantage of its own wrong in reference
to the arrangement agreed upon by it with Respondent 1-
plaintiff and including to defeat the claim of the appellant
in the arbitration proceedings. .....”
(iii)  2022 SCC Online SC 928            [Akella Lalitha vs Konda
Hanumantha Rao], wherein the Hon'ble Supreme Court held as follows:-
“ ..........16. Coming to address the second issue,
while this Court is not apathetic to the predicament of the
Respondent grandparents, it is a fact that absolutely no
relief was ever sought by them for the change of surname
of the child to that of first husband/ son of respondents. It
is settled law that relief not found on pleadings should not
be granted. If a Court considers or grants a relief for which
no prayer or pleading was made depriving the respondent
of an opportunity to oppose or resist such relief, it would
lead to miscarriage of justice.
17.. In the case of Messrs. Trojan & Co. Ltd. Vs.
Rm.N.N. Nagappa Chettiar2, this Court considered the
issue as to whether relief not asked for by a party could be
granted and that too without having proper pleadings. The
Court held as under:-
"It is well settled that the decision of a case
cannot be based on grounds outside the
pleadings of the parties and it is the case
pleaded that has to be found. Without an
amendment of the plaint, the Court was not
entitled to grant the relief not asked for and
no prayer was ever made to amend the plaint
so as to incorporate in it an alternative case.”
18. In the case of Bharat Amratlal Kothari & Anr. Vs.
Dosukhan Samadkhan Sindhi & Ors.3 held:
"Though the Court has very wide discretion in
granting relief, the Court, however, cannot,
ignoring and keeping aside the norms and
principles governing grant of relief, grant a
relief not even prayed for by the petitioner."
19. In this case while directing for change of surname
of the child, the High Court has traversed beyond pleadings
and such directions are liable to be set aside on this
ground..........”
(iv) (2004) 4 SCC 697        [Deoraj v. State of Maharashtra,]
wherein the Hon'ble Supreme Court held as follows:-
“ .......11. The courts and tribunals seized of the
proceedings within their jurisdiction take a reasonable
time in disposing of the same. This is on account of fair-
procedure requirement which involves delay intervening
between the previous and the next procedural steps
leading towards preparation of case for hearing. Then, the
courts are also overburdened and their hands are full. As
the conclusion of hearing on merits is likely to take some
time, the parties press for interim relief being granted in
the interregnum. An order of interim relief may or may not
be a reasoned one but the factors of prima facie case,
irreparable injury and balance of convenience do work at
the back of the mind of the one who passes an order of
interim nature. Ordinarily, the court is inclined to maintain
status quo as obtaining on the date of the commencement
of the proceedings. However, there are a few cases which
call for the court's leaning not in favour of maintaining the
status quo and still lesser in percentage are the cases when
an order tantamounting to a mandamus is required to be
issued even at an interim stage. There are matters of
significance and of moment posing themselves as moment
of truth. Such cases do cause dilemma and put the wits of
any judge to test.
12. Situations emerge where the granting of an
interim relief would tantamount to granting the final relief
itself. And then there may be converse cases where
withholding of an interim relief would tantamount to
dismissal of the main petition itself; for, by the time the
main matter comes up for hearing there would be nothing
left to be allowed as relief to the petitioner though all the
findings may be in his favour. In such cases the
availability of a very strong prima facie case — of a
standard much higher than just prima facie case, the
considerations of balance of convenience and irreparable
injury forcefully tilting the balance of the case totally in
favour of the applicant may persuade the court to grant an
interim relief though it amounts to granting the final relief
itself. Of course, such would be rare and exceptional
cases. The court would grant such an interim relief only if
satisfied that withholding of it would prick the conscience
of the court and do violence to the sense of justice,
resulting in injustice being perpetuated throughout the
hearing, and at the end the court would not be able to
vindicate the cause of justice. Obviously such would be
rare cases accompanied by compelling circumstances,
where the injury complained of is immediate and pressing
and would cause extreme hardship. The conduct of the
parties shall also have to be seen and the court may put
the parties on such terms as may be prudent. ......”
(v) 2013) 9 SCC 221            [Mohd. Mehtab Khan v. Khushnuma
Ibrahim Khan, wherein the Hon'ble Supreme Court held as follows:-
“ ..........17. While the bar under Section 6(3) of the
SR Act may not apply to the instant case in view of the
initial forum in which the suit was filed and the appeal
arising from the interim order being under the letters
patent issued to the Bombay High Court, as held by a
Constitution          Bench     of    this     Court        in P.S.
Sathappan v. Andhra Bank Ltd. [(2004) 11 SCC 672] ,
what is ironical is that the correctness of the order passed
in respect of the interim entitlement of the parties has
reached this Court under Article 136 of the Constitution.
Ordinarily and in the normal course, by this time, the suit
itself should have been disposed of. Tragically, the logical
conclusion to the suit is nowhere in sight and it is on
account of the proverbial delays that have plagued the
system that interim matters are being contested to the last
court with the greatest of vehemence and fervour. Given
the ground realities of the situation it is neither feasible
nor practical to take the view that interim matters, even
though they may be inextricably connected with the merits
of the main suit, should always be answered by
maintaining a strict neutrality, namely, by a refusal to
adjudicate. Such a stance by the courts is neither feasible
nor practicable. Courts, therefore, will have to venture to
decide interim matters on consideration of issues that are
best left for adjudication in the full trial of the suit. In view
of the inherent risk in performing such an exercise which
is bound to become delicate in most cases the principles
that the courts must follow in this regard are required to
be stated in some detail though it must be made clear that
such principles cannot be entrapped within any
straitjacket formula or any precise laid down norms. The
courts must endeavour to find out if interim relief can be
granted on consideration of issues other than those
involved in the main suit and also whether partial interim
relief would satisfy the ends of justice till final disposal of
the matter. The consequences of grant of injunction on the
defendant if the plaintiff is to lose the suit along with the
consequences on the plaintiff where injunction is refused
but eventually the suit is decreed has to be carefully
weighed and balanced by the court in every given case.
Interim reliefs which amount to pre-trial decrees must be
avoided wherever possible. Though experience has shown
that observations and clarifications to the effect that the
findings recorded are prima facie and tentative, meant or
intended only for deciding the interim entitlement of the
parties have not worked well and interim findings on
issues concerning the main suit has had a telling effect in
the process of final adjudication it is here that strict
exercise of judicial discipline will be of considerable help
and assistance. The power of self-correction and
comprehension of the orders of superior forums in the
proper perspective will go a long way in resolving the
dangers inherent in deciding an interim matter on issues
that may have a close connection with those arising in the
main suit. ......”
(vi) (2017) 11 SCC 437           [International Confederation of
Societies of Authors and Composers (ICSAC) v. Aditya Pandey,,]
wherein the Hon'ble Supreme Court held as follows:-
“ ..... 26. The present appeals being against an
interim order, naturally, strong and compulsive reasons
exist for exercise of judicial restraint in the manner and
extent of exercise of jurisdiction. Though it is too
elementary, it must be said that the Court must refrain from
expressing any opinion, whatsoever, touching upon the
merits of the controversy, lest, the same may prejudice
either of the parties in the suit. While there can be no doubt
that an order, even interim, sans any reasons, would not be
judicially acceptable, the precise exercise that a court would
be required to undertake at the interim stage must be left to
the wise discretion of the court concerned itself. It is not
only difficult but also undesirable to lay down the
parameters and contours of the exercise of judicial power at
the interim stage by expressly laying conditions which
would be binding under Article 141 of the Constitution. But
it needs to be reminded that an elaborate reasoning with the
“footnote” that the same are prima facie or tentative is
hardly an effective remedy to prevent the imprint of such
observations on the human mind that mans the court at
different levels. This is what appears to have happened in
the present case.
(vii) Manu/TN/6738/2020 [Cherian Abraham v,Babu Daniel ]
wherein the Hon'ble Supreme Court held as follows:-
“......17. Secondly, any findings on the legality of
the inclusion of proxy vote in the proposed EGM would
tantamount to deciding the main relief in the suit itself.
The suit has been filed challenging OSA.No.238 of 2019
validity of the notice issued by a suspended member, in
which, one among the issues of inclusion of proxy votes as
a mode of voting, has been challenged. When the legality
of the notice itself is under challenge, consideration for
conducting the EGM by proxy votes, by this Court, will
effectively decide the main relief claimed in the suit,
without subjecting the parties to a proper trial and framing
of the relevant issues, which exercise, could be
impermissible. If this Court is to render its findings on the
permissibility of proxy votes and consequently declare the
outcome of the EGM, there would be no issues pending
for adjudication in the main suit and the relief claimed
therein may become infructuous. .....”
(viii) (2006) 8 SCC 367         [M. Gurudas v. Rasaranjan,] wherein
the Hon'ble Supreme Court held as follows:-
“ ....19.A finding on “prima facie case” would be a
finding of fact. However, while arriving at such a finding
of fact, the court not only must arrive at a conclusion that
a case for trial has been made out but also other factors
requisite for grant of injunction exist. There may be a
debate as has been sought to be raised by Dr. Rajeev
Dhavan that the decision of the House of Lords
in American Cyanamid Co. v. Ethicon Ltd. [(1975) 1 All
ER 504 : 1975 AC 396 : (1975) 2 WLR 316 (HL)] would
have no application in a case of this nature as was opined
by this           Court     in Colgate    Palmolive        (India)
Ltd. v. Hindustan Lever Ltd. [(1999) 7 SCC 1] and S.M.
Dyechem Ltd. v. Cadbury (India) Ltd. [(2000) 5 SCC
573] but we are not persuaded to delve thereinto.
38. But, then conduct of the plaintiffs would also be
relevant. The court while granting an order of injunction,
therefore, would take into consideration as to whether the
plaintiffs have prevaricated their stand from stage to stage.
Even this question had not been adverted to by the learned
courts below.
39. While doing so, the courts, as has been noticed
in Dhariwal            Industries      Ltd. v. M.S.S.        Food
Products [(2005) 3 SCC 63] whereupon Mr Mahabir
Singh relied upon, would look into the documents
produced before the trial court as also the appellate court
in terms of Order 41 Rule 27 of the Code of Civil
Procedure but the same would not mean that this Court
must confine itself only to the questions which were raised
before the courts below and preclude itself from
considering other relevant questions although explicit on
the face of the records. Questions of law in a given case
may be considered by this Court although raised for the
first time. The question as to whether this Court would
permit the parties to raise fresh contentions, however,
must be based on the materials placed on records. ...........”
(ix) (2002) 4 SCC 68         [J.M. Biswas v. N.K. Bhattacharjee]
wherein the Hon'ble Supreme Court held as follows:-
“ .....10. From the narration of facts and the
contentions raised on behalf of the parties, it is clear that
the dispute raised in the case has lost its relevance due to
passage of time and subsequent events which have taken
place during the pendency of the litigation. As noted
earlier, the dispute in the case relates to election of office-
bearers of the South-Eastern Railway Men's Union. The
dispute arose at a point of time when both the appellant
and Respondent 1 were members of the said Union. Now
both have ceased to be members of the Union. Further,
successive elections have been held to elect office-bearers
and the office-bearers so elected have been recognized by
the management. In the circumstances, continuing this
litigation will be like flogging a dead horse. Such
litigation, irrespective of the result, will neither benefit the
parties in the litigation nor will serve the interest of the
Union. Accepting the contentions raised on behalf of
Respondent 1 that the successive elections held in the
meantime were invalid because he was not permitted to
participate in them and to quash all such elections and
direct holding of fresh elections under the supervision of
the court, will be contrary to democratic functioning of the
employees' Union. Furthermore, courts in the present
situation of exploding dockets can ill afford to stand
(sic spend) time in such an exercise. ........”
(x) (2003) 7 SCC 219               [Rajesh D. Darbar v. Narasingrao
Krishnaji Kulkarn] wherein the Hon'ble Supreme Court held as follows:-
“ .............4. The impact of subsequent happenings
may now be spelt out. First, its bearing on the right of
action, second, on the nature of the relief and third, on its
importance to create or destroy substantive rights. Where
the nature of the relief, as originally sought, has become
obsolete or unserviceable or a new form of relief will be
more efficacious on account of developments subsequent
to the suit or even during the appellate stage, it is but fair
that the relief is moulded, varied or reshaped in the light of
updated facts. Patterson v. State of Alabama [294 US 600
: 79 L Ed 1082 (1934)] (US at p. 607) illustrates this
position. It is important that the party claiming the relief
or change of relief must have the same right from which
either the first or the modified remedy may flow.
Subsequent events in the course of the case cannot be
constitutive of substantive rights enforceable in that very
litigation except in a narrow category (later spelt out) but
may influence the equitable jurisdiction to mould reliefs.
Conversely, where rights have already vested in a party,
they cannot be nullified or negated by subsequent events
save where there is a change in the law and it is made
applicable at             any   stage. Lachmeshwar        Prasad
Shukul v. Keshwar Lal Chaudhuri [1940 FCR 84 : AIR
1941 FC 5] falls in this category. Courts of justice may,
when the compelling equities of a case oblige them, shape
reliefs — cannot deny rights — to make them justly
relevant in the updated circumstances. Where the relief is
discretionary, courts may exercise this jurisdiction to
avoid injustice. Likewise, where the right to the remedy
depends, under the statute itself, on the presence or
absence of certain basic facts at the time the relief is to be
ultimately granted, the court, even in appeal, can take note
of such supervening facts with fundamental impact. This
Court's judgment in Pasupuleti Venkateswarlu v. Motor
1409] read in its statutory setting, falls in this category.
Where a cause of action is deficient but later events have
made up the deficiency, the court may, in order to avoid
multiplicity of litigation, permit amendment and continue
the proceeding, provided no prejudice is caused to the
other side. All these are done only in exceptional
situations and just cannot be done if the statute, on which
the legal proceeding is based, inhibits, by its scheme or
otherwise, such change in the cause of action or relief. The
primary concern of the court is to implement the justice of
the legislation. Rights vested by virtue of a statute cannot
be divested by this equitable doctrine (see V.P.R.V.
Chockalingam Chetty v. Seethai Ache [AIR 1927 PC 252

The rule may be stated from an Irish case in the
following words: ‘Where there are general words of
description, following an enumeration of particular
things such general words are to be construed
distributively, reddendo singula singulis; and if the
general words will apply to some things and not to
others, the general words are to be applied to those

applying “devise” to “real” property and “bequeath”
to “personal” property [ Osborne, Concise Law
Dictionary, p. 269] and in the sentence: ‘If any one
shall draw or load any sword or gun’ the word

bound to act strictly according to the rules, whether a

Shackleton on the Law and Practice of Meetings, 13th

“The regulations of the body on whose behalf

to be followed. The rules of a club, for example,
may provide that notices of meetings posted at the
clubhouse and a copy sent to every member.

Wharncliffe [[L.R.] 13 Ch. 346 at 352] The
greater the importance of the matter to be
discussed, for example, where the expulsion of a
club member is to be considered or rules are to be
altered, the more the need to send a copy of the
notice to each member rather than merely affixing
it to the club notice board. On the other hand, in
matters affecting clubs the courts eschew a
meticulous      examination      of    the      rules
reasonableness and fairness are given more
weight than a rigid interpretation.

It has been held that “post” includes registered
post - TO Supplies (London) Ltd. v. Jerry

documents that are required or authorised by any
enactment to be sent by registered post are
concerned, sending can be effected by the
recorded postal delivery service. [Recorded
Delivery Service Act 1962 Sec.1] Where an
important notice is concerned, the use of recorded
delivery can provide proof that it has been
received; however, the use of this service or
registered post for notice of meetings is rare.
Where the regulations of the body concerned
provide for notice to be sent by post, it is
normally the responsibility of the member to keep
up to-date the record of his address in that body's

(xiv) AIR 1962 SC 666 [Nilkantha Sidramappa Ningashetti v.
Kashinath Somanna Ningashetti] wherein the Hon'ble Supreme Court
“.......7. The first question to determine is
whether limitation for filing an application to set
aside the award began to run against the appellant-
Defendant 12 from a date more than a month before
9-11-1948, when a written statement on his behalf
was filed stating that the award be declared null and
void. According to Article 158 of the First Schedule
to the Indian Limitation Act, the period of limitation
for an application to set aside an award under the
Arbitration Act, 1940, begins to run from “the date
of service of the notice of the filing of the award”.
No notice in writing was issued by the court to the
appellant or his guardian intimating that the award
has been filed in Court. It is therefore urged for the
appellant that the period of limitation for filing an
application to set aside the award never began to run
against him. There could be no date of service of
notice, when no notice had been issued. On the
other hand, it is submitted for the respondents, that
the limitation began to run from 21-2-1948, the date
on which the court adjourned the case for parties'
say to 22-3-1948, and that, in any case, from 7-9-
1948, when his guardian had applied for time to file
the statement after having received a summons from
the court on 5-9-1948. On 21-2-1948, the pleaders
were present, according to the entry against the date
in the roznama of the Court. Notice to the counsel of
the filing of the award means or amounts to notice
to the party.
Arbitration Act, 1940 (Act 10 of 1940) requires the
arbitrators or umpire to give notice in writing to the
parties of the making and signing of the award. Sub-
section (2) of that section requires the Court, after
the filing of the award, to give notice to the parties
of the filing of the award. The difference in the
provisions of the two sub-sections with respect to
the giving of notice is significant and indicates
clearly that the notice which the court is to give to
the parties of the filing of the award need not be a
notice in writing. The notice can be given orally. No
question of the service of the notice in the formal
way of delivering the notice or tendering it to the
party can arise in the case of a notice given orally.
The communication of the information that an
award has been filed is sufficient compliance with
the requirements of sub-section, (2) of Section 14
with respect to the giving of the notice to the parties
concerned about the filing of the award. “Notice”
does not necessarily mean “communication in
writing”. “Notice”, according to the Oxford Concise
Dictionary, means “intimation, intelligence,
warning” and has this meaning in expressions like
“give notice, have notice” and it also means “formal
intimation of something, or instructions to do
something” and has such a meaning in expressions
like “notice to quit, till further notice”. We are of
opinion that the expression “give notice” in sub-
section (2) of Section 14, simply means giving
intimation of the filing of the award, which certainly
was given to the parties through their pleaders on
21-2-1948. Notice to the pleader is notice to the
party, in view of Rule 5 of Order 3 of the Civil
Procedure Code, which provides that any process
served on the pleader of any party shall be
presumed to be duly communicated and made
known to the party whom the pleader represents
and, unless the court otherwise directs, shall be as
effectual for all purposes as if the same had been
given to or served on the party in person.
expression “date of service of notice” in column 3 of
Article 158 of the Limitation Act to mean only a
notice in writing served in a formal manner. When
the legislature used the word “notice” it must be
presumed to have borne in mind that it means not
only a formal intimation but also an informal one.
Similarly, it must be deemed to have in mind the
fact that service of a notice would include
constructive or informal notice. If its intention were
to exclude the latter sense of the words “notice” and
“service” it would have said so explicitly. It has not
done so here. Moreover, to construe the expression
as meaning only a written notice served formally on
the party to be affected, will leave the door open to
that party, eventhough with full knowledge of the
filing of the award he has taken part in the
subsequent proceedings, to challenge the decree
based upon the award at any time upon the ground
that for want of a proper notice his right to object to
the filing of the award had not even accrued. Such a
result would stultify the whole object which
underlies the process of arbitration — the speedy
decision of a dispute by a tribunal chosen by the
parties. .....
(xv) (1993) 3 SCC 445 [Food Corpn. of India v. E. Kuttappan]
wherein the Hon'ble Supreme Court held as follows:-
“ ......10. Assimilating the legal thoughts afore-
expressed and applied to the facts afore-stated, it
becomes manifest that when the arbitrator had sent the
award and other papers to the respondent through his
counsel, unless he had authorised the respondent or
his counsel on his behalf to the filing of it in court, it
cannot be assumed that when the respondent or his
counsel filed the award and other connected papers in
court it was not done for and on behalf of the
arbitrator. Instantly it was the respondent who by his
letter had requested the arbitrator to send to his lawyer
the award for filing it into court and to whom the
arbitrator obliged on such request. In our view, when
the arbitrator chose to accede to the request of the
respondent in specific terms, he by necessary
implication authorised the respondent's counsel to file
the award and the connected papers in court on his
behalf. The law enjoined on the arbitrator to file the
award in court for which purpose he could even be
directed by the court. The obligation of filing the
award in court is a legal imperative on the arbitrator.
The agency of the party or its lawyer employed by the
arbitrator for the purpose normally need be specific
but can otherwise be deduced, inferred or implied from
the facts and circumstances of a given case. It needs,
however, shedding the impression that when a lawyer
files the award in court when given to him by the
arbitrator his implied authority to do so, shall not be
presumed to exist. In the instant case, no one raised
the plea that the filing of the award in court by the
respondent's lawyer was without the authority of the
Arbitrator and the courts below were not engaged on
that question. The matter was agitated on the basis of
knowledge of award from that fact.
11. On the strength of afore-mentioned two cases
of this Court, i.e. Nilkantha case [(1962) 2 SCR 551 :
AIR 1962 SC 666] and Indian Rayon case [(1988) 4
SCC 31] it was claimed on behalf of the appellants that
though the legal requirement is that the notice be sent
by the court, some other act of the court is enough to
foist awareness of the filing of the award in court,
wherefrom the period of limitation was to commence.
Instantly, it was urged that when the award had
factually been placed before the court and the court had
accepted its placement into it on October 25, 1988
itself, the factual filing of the award had been made and
sequelly notice to the respondent through his counsel.
Even though the court had subsequently on November
3, 1988 issued notice for November 7, 1988, the former
act, according to the appellant, was enough compliance
with court sending the notice and the latter act was of
no consequence. It does not lie in the mouth of the
respondent to say that though he filed the award in
court through his counsel, with or without the implied
or express authority of the arbitrator, he did not have
the corresponding knowledge of the filing of the award,
when the award was readily received by the court. It
seems to us that the mute language inherent in the
action of the court did convey to the party placing the
award before it, the factum of the award being filed in
court. The mere fact that at a subsequent stage, the
court issued notice to the parties informing them of the
filing of the award in court for the purpose of anyone to
object to the award being made the rule of the court is
an act of the court which cannot in law prejudice the
rights of the parties. If once it is taken that the period of
limitation for the purposes of filing the objection,
insofar as the respondent was concerned, had begun on
October 25, 1988, the objections filed by it on
December 6, 1988 were obviously barred by time, those
having been filed beyond the prescribed period of thirty
days. If this be the logical conclusion, the appeals shall
merit acceptance, holding the objections filed by the
respondents to be time barred. Thus, so concluding, we
allow these appeals, set aside the common judgment
and order of the High Court, and that of the trial court,
holding the objections filed by the respondents to be
time barred. The trial court will proceed further in these
matters in accordance with law. The parties to bear their
own costs.
(xvi) (2003) 3 SCC 454 [CST v. Subhash & Co.] wherein the
Hon'ble Supreme Court held as follows:-
“ ........12. Whether service of notice is valid or not
is essentially a question of fact. In the instant case,
learned Single Judge found that certain procedures were
not followed while effecting service by affixture. There
was no finding recorded that such service was non est in
the eye of the law. In a given case, if the assessee knows
about the proceedings and there is some irregularity in
the service of notice, the direction for continuing
proceedings cannot be faulted. It would depend upon the
nature of irregularity and its effect and the question of
prejudice which are to be adjudicated in each case on the
basis of surrounding facts. If, however, the service of
notice is treated as non est in the eye of the law, it would
not be permissible to direct de novo assessment without
considering the question of limitation. There also the
question of prejudice has to be considered.
17. Notice is making something known, of what a
man was or might be ignorant of before. And it produces
diverse effects, for, by it, the party who gives the same
shall have the same benefit, which otherwise he should
not have had; the party to whom the notice is given is
made subject to some action or charge, that otherwise he
had not been liable to; and his estate in danger of
prejudice.
(i) Non-issue of notice or mistake in the issue of notice
or defective service of notice does not affect the
jurisdiction of the assessing officer, if otherwise
reasonable opportunity of being heard has been given.
(ii) Issue of notice as prescribed in the Rules constitutes
a part of reasonable opportunity of being heard.
(iii) If prejudice has been caused by non-issue or invalid
service of notice the proceeding would be vitiated. But
irregular service of notice would not render the
proceedings invalid; more so, if the assessee by his
conduct has rendered service impracticable or
impossible.
(iv) In a given case when the principles of natural justice
are stated to have been violated it is open to the
Appellate Authority in appropriate cases to set aside the
order and require the assessing officer to decide the case
de novo. .....”
(xvii) Manu/OR/0097/1978               [Debaraj Mallika v. Collector,
Puri and Ors ] wherein the Hon'ble Supreme Court held as follows:-
“ ....7. The first contention of the Petitioner is that
the provision regarding giving of notice at least fifteen
clear days before the date fixed for the meeting has not
been complied with. It is contended that though the
Subdivisional Officer issued the notice on 11-8- 1977 for
convening a special meeting and fixed the date to 31-8-
1977, it was only on 17-8-1977 that an attempt was made
to serve the notice on opposite party No. 3 Gopal Mallick.
It is asserted by opposite parties 4 to la, 12, 13, 15, 16, 18
and 19 that the notice was received by all the members of
the Grama Panchayat on 16-8-1977 except the Petitioner
and his brother opposite party No. 3 - who avoided
service of the notice. It is stated in their counter affidavit
that when the attempt to serve the notices on the
Petitioner and opposite party No. 3 through a peon, failed
on 16-8-1977 and 17-8- 1977, the notices were sent by
registered post. The notice sent to opposite party No. 3 by
post was duly received by him, but the Petitioner avoided
to accept the same even though he was present in the
village. These averments have not seen controverted by
the Petitioner. Rather it is admitted in para 3 of the writ
petition that when the attempt to serve the notice on
opposite party No. 3. through the peon of the B.D.O's
office failed on 17-8-1977, the notice was sent to him by
post. In his counter affidavit the opposite party No 3 has
not taken the plea of want of notice. His contention is that
as there was no proposed Resolution to be moved, he did
not attend the meeting on 31-8- 1977. Clause (d) of Sub-
section (2) of Section 24 provides that a copy of the notice
shall be published at least seven days prior to the date
fixed for the meeting in the notice-hoard of the Samiti. It
is maintained by the opposite parties that a copy of the
notice was duly published on the notice-board of the
Samiti and the Petitioner as Sarpanch was a member of
the Samiti at that time. This averment has not been denied
by the Petitioner. According to the Clause (e), the
proceedings of the meeting shall not be invalidated merely
on the ground that the notice has not been received by
any member. The ordinary meaning of the word 'notice' is
knowledge, information or announcement. On a proper
construction of Clauses (c), (d) and (e) of Sub-section (2)
of Section 24, the legislative intention appears to be that a
communication which carries knowledge of the fact that a
no-confidence motion would be brought should be sent to
the members. The provision of Section 24(2)k) regarding
notice of at least fifteen dear days is directly in character
and if there has been substantial compliance with the
requirements of the section, that is sufficient to uphold the
validity of the notice and the proceedings of the meeting
convened in pursuance thereof.
8. The next contention of the Petitioner is that there
was no requisition for the meeting and there was also no
proposed Resolution to be moved in the meeting.
Admittedly Annexures 1/1 and 1/2 were sent along with
the notice. Annexure 1/1 is the requisition which was
signed by more than a third of the total number of
members of the Panchayat. Annexure 1/2 is the
Resolution which was proposed to be moved. The
Petitioner's contention IS that Annexures 1/1 and 1/2 are
only in the nature of information about a Resolution
having been already passed and there was no indication
about any proposal to move the Resolution in the special
meeting. In the notice (Annexure 1) issued by the
Subdivisional Officer, Nayagarh it was clearly mentioned
that the enclosures thereto were the requisition and the
proposed Resolution. It was no doubt stated in Annexure
1/1 that a Resolution recording want of confidence in the
Petitioner had been passed on 2-7-1977, but therein a
request was made to the Subdivisional Officer, Nayagarh
to take legal steps on the proposal to bring a motion of
no-confidence. The contention raised on behalf of the
Petitioner is, therefore, without any force. It is clear from
the proceedings of the meeting held on 31-8-1977
(Annexure-2) that the motion of no-confidence essentially
on the same basis as contained in Annexure 1/2 was
discussed in the meeting and was duly passed. Out of the
total strength of 19 members of the panchayat including
the Petitioner, 13 members voted in favour of the motion
of no confidence against the Petitioner. We hold that there
was substantial compliance with the provisions of law and
the Petitioner was duly removed from the Sarpanchship.
(xviii)    (1969) 2 SCC 694 [Parasramka Commercial Co. v.
Union of India] wherein the Hon'ble Supreme Court held as follows:-
“.......5. It is not necessary to go into the reasoning
which made the learned Judges in these cases to lay down
that there must be a proper notice in writing of the making
of the award. That follows in fact from the words of
Section 14(1) of the Arbitration Act. That section says that
when the arbitrators or umpire have given their award, they
shall sign it and shall give notice in writing to the parties of
the making and signing thereof and of the amount of fees
and charges payable in respect of the arbitration and
award. What will be considered a sufficient notice in
writing of the making and signing of the award is a
question of fact. In the cited cases emphasis sometimes has
been laid upon the latter part of the sub-section which
speaks of the arbitration and award. Sometimes emphasis
has been placed upon the opening words namely that there
should be a notice in writing. Reading the word “notice” as
we generally do, it denotes merely an intimation to the
party concerned of a particular fact. It seems to us that we
cannot limit the words “notice in writing” to only a letter.
Notice may take several forms. It must be sufficient in
writing and must intimate quite clearly that the award has
been made and signed. In the present case, a copy of the
award signed by the arbitrator was sent to the company. It
appears to us that the company had sufficient notice that
the award had been made and signed. In fact the two letters
of May 5 and May 16 to which we have referred quite
clearly show that the company knew full well that the
arbitrator had given the award, made it and signed it. In
these circumstances to insist upon a letter which perhaps
was also sent (though there is some doubt about it) is to
refine the law beyond the legitimate requirements. The only
omission was that there was no notice of the amount of the
fees and charges payable in respect of arbitration and
award. But that was not an essential part of the notice for
the purpose of limitation. To emphasise the latter part as
being the essential part of the notice is to make the first
part depend upon the determination of the fees and charges
and their inclusion in the notice. A written notice clearly
intimating the parties concerned that the award had been
made and signed, in our opinion certainly starts limitation.
6. In this view of the matter we are in agreement
with the decision of the learned Single       Judge         who
has endorsed the opinion of the Subordinate Judge that
limitation began to run from the receipt of the copy of the
award which was signed by the Arbitrator and which gave
due notice to the party concerned that the award had been
made and signed. That is how the party itself understood
when it acknowledged the copy sent to it. Therefore, the
application must be treated as being out of time and the
decision of the High Court to so treat it was correct in all
the circumstances of the case. ........”
(xix)   ILR 1941 Bom 497 [ A.S. Krishnan vs M. Sundaram]
wherein the Hon'ble Supreme Court held that even if the Court decides in
favour of the plaintiff, the society can call' a meeting of its members
tomorrow, confirm the acts of the defendants and confirm their position
as members of the managing committee, thus rendering the decision of
the Court a nullity.
(xx)     (1997) 3 CTC 229 [S.Thirunavukkarasu v. Selvi J.
Jayalalithaa] wherein the Hon'ble Supreme Court held as follows:-
“ .....35. In the light of the contentions of the parties,
as can be seen from the pleadings and submissions, the
following points arise for consideration and decision:-
i. Whether the suit filed by the plaintiff is prima-
facie maintainable;
ii. Whether the meeting of the general council
convened by the defendant on 3.6.1997 was
authorised and valid; and
iii. Whether the order of the learned single Judge
granting interim injunction calls for interference,
keeping in view, prima facie case, balance of
convenience, and irreparable injury, if any, that may
be sustained if the order of injunction is refused?
We will deal with these points in seriatim.
36. Point No. 1: According to the learned senior
counsel for the appellants, the subject matter of the suit
relates to the dispute regarding indoor management of the
party affairs; the suit does not involve dispute as to the
property of the party; the suit in the present form is not
maintainable as the plaintiff has filed the suit in her
individual capacity as the General Secretary and not for
the party, and the suit is filed against the defendant in his
individual capacity; as such the orders that may be passed
cannot be binding on the members of the defendant's
group; the suit is not also a representative suit in character;
and there is implied bar in taking cognizance of the suit
under paragraph 15 of the Symbols Order.
37. It is well settled that under Section 9 of the Code of
Civil Procedure, all suits of civil nature can be entertained
by a Civil Court unless such a suit is expressly, or by
necessary implication, barred. It is not shown to us that
there was any express bar or prohibition for the plaintiff in
filing the suit. It cannot also be said that the suit is not of a
civil nature.
38. Shri Shanthi Bushan, learned senior counsel relied
on paragraphs 201 and 202 of Halsbury's Laws of England,
Volume 6, Fourth Edition. Paragraph 201 gives definition of
a club. Paragraph 202 reads:
“202. Jurisdiction of court over constitution of
club. The court does not take cognisance of the
rules of a voluntary society, entered into merely for
the regulation of its own affair, save to protect the
disposal and administration of property. The rules
of a club may effectively provide that the governing
body shall be the final arbiter on questions of fact
but cannot prevent its decisions on questions of law
being determined by the courts.”
Relying on the statement contained in paragraph 202, he
submitted that the court could not entertain the suit as the
dispute did not relate to the disposal and administration of
the property.
39. A careful reading of this paragraph 202 does not
show that there was a bar of suit, but it only shows that the
Courts cannot take cognisance of the rules of a voluntary
society entered into merely for the regulation of its own
affairs save to protect the disposal and administration of
property. In the same paragraph itself, it is further stated that
the rules of a club may effectively provide that the governing
body shall be the final arbiter of questions of fact but cannot
prevent its decisions on questions of law being determined by
the Courts (Italics applied). In this view, we are unable to
agree with the submission that the suit of the plaintiff, prima
facie, is not maintainable merely on the ground that the
dispute does not relate to the disposal and administration of
property of the party. Moreover the resolution No. 6 passed
in the meeting convened by the defendant and held on
3.6.1997 is to request the plaintiff to hand over the party
files, movable and immovable property belonging to the party
to the defendant. Again resolution No. 18 directs the plaintiff
to return a sum of Rs. 4 crores taken away by her from out of
the party fund to pay her individual income tax arrears, and if
she fails to return the said amount it should be collected
through legal process. Hence it cannot be said at this stage
that the dispute does not relate to disposal and administration
of the property of the party, prima facie.
40. The learned counsel cited few more decisions in
support of his submission, which are not directly on the point
although some inferences were to be drawn from the said
decisions. Further in the light of the judgment of the
Honourable Supreme Court in “Most Rev. R.M.A.
Metropolitan and Others v, Moran Mar Marthoma and
another, 1995 Supp (4) S.C.C. 286, we consider it
unnecessary to refer to the other decisions cited by the
learned senior counsel for the appellants. Paragraph 28 of the
said Judgment reads:-
“One of the basic principles of law is that every
right has a remedy. Ubi jus ibi remediem is the well
known maxim. Every civil suit is cognizable unless it
is barred, “there is an inherent right in every person to
bring a suit of a civil nature and unless the suit is
barred by statute one may, at one's peril, bring a suit
of one's choice. It is no answer to a suit, howsoever
frivolous the claim, that the law confers no such right
to sue” Ganga Bai v, Vijay Kumar, 1974 (2) S.C.C.
393. The expansive nature of the section is
demonstrated by use of phraseology both positive and
negative. The earlier part opens the door widely and
latter debars entry to only those which are expressly or
impliedly barred. The two explanations, one existing
from inception and latter added in 1976 bring out
clearly the legislative intention of extending operation
of the section to such religious matters where right to
property or office is involved irrespective of whether
any fee is attached to the office or not. The language
used is simple but explicit and clear. It is structured on
the basic principle of a civilised jurisprudence that
absence of machinery for enforcement of right renders
it nugatory. The heading which is normally key to the
section brings out unequivocally that all civil suits are
cognizable unless barred. What is meant by it is
explained further by widening the ambit of the section
by use of the word ‘shall’ and the expression ‘all suits
of a civil nature’ unless ‘expressly or impliedly
barred’.”
41. In paragraph 29 of the said Judgment it is stated that not
only suits which are civil, but are even of civil nature, can be
entertained by Courts unless such suits are barred expressly
or impliedly. The Constitution Bench of the Apex Court
in Narayan Row v. Ishwarlal Bhagwandas, A.I.R. 1965 S.C.
1818, dealing with the expression “civil proceedings” has
“a proceedings for relief against infringement of civil
right of a person is a civil proceedings.”
In the same paragraph, referring to another case in Arbind
kumar Singh v. Nand Kishore Prasad, A.I.R. 1968 S.C. 1227
wherein it was held that all proceedings which directly affect
civil rights are civil proceedings, it is further stated that the
word ‘civil nature’ is wider than the word ‘civil proceedings’.
Thus section 9 would therefore be available in every case
where the dispute has the characteristic of affecting one's
rights which are not only civil but of a civil nature.
42. In paragraph 30 of the said judgment, their Lordships
of the Supreme Court, referring to Explanations I and II
Section 9, have noticed thatthere are numerous authorities
where dispute about entry in the temple, right to worship,
performing certain rituals, have been taken cognisance of and
decided by civil Courts. In paragraph 38 of the same
Judgment the Apex Court went on to say that,
“The dispute about the religious office is a civil
dispute as it involves disputes relating to rights which
may be religious in nature but are civil in
consequence.”
The learned single Judge has also referred to and relied on
the Judgment of the Apex Court aforementioned, and rightly
so in our opinion also.
43. The learned single judge has stated that the plaintiff is
entitled to hold the post of General Secretary unless she is
legally removed or the term of office expired; membership in
the party confers certain rights which cannot be denied except
in accordance with the rules of the party; if her rights are
interfered with as the General Secretary of the party, she was
entitled to take remedy under Section 9 of the C.P.C. This
being the position, we have no hesitation to say that the suit
filed by the plaintiff being one of civil nature, prima facie, is
maintainable though the dispute raised directly does not relate
to any property of the party. We have already stated above
that the reliance placed by the learned senior counsel for the
defendant on paragraph 202 of Halsbury's Laws of England,
on its plain reading, does not help the defendant. Added to
that, when we have a direct decision of the Honourable
Supreme Court, we are bound by it. ......”
(xxi) (2001) 7 SCC 231 [B.R. Kapur v. State of T.N.,] wherein
the Hon'ble Supreme Court held as follows:-
“....15. Central to the controversy herein is Article 164,
with special reference to sub-article (4) thereof. This Court
has considered its import in a number of decisions. In Har
Sharan Verma v. Tribhuvan Narain Singh, Chief Minister,
U.P. [(1971) 1 SCC 616] a Constitution Bench rendered the
decision in connection with the appointment of the first
respondent therein as the Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh at a
time when he was not a member of either House of the
Legislature of that State. The Court said: (SCC p. 617, paras 3
“3. It seems to us that clause (4) of Article 164
must be interpreted in the context of Articles 163 and
164 of the Constitution. Article 163(1) provides that
‘there shall be a Council of Ministers with the Chief
Minister at the head to aid and advise the Governor in
the exercise of his functions, except insofar as he is by
or under this Constitution required to exercise his
functions or any of them in his discretion’. Under
clause (1) of Article 164, the Chief Minister has to be
appointed by the Governor and the other Ministers
have to be appointed by him on the advice of the
Chief Minister. They all hold office during the
pleasure of the Governor. Clause (1) does not provide
any qualification for the person to be selected by the
Governor as the Chief Minister or Minister, but clause
(2) makes it essential that the Council of Ministers
shall be collectively responsible to the Legislative
Assembly of the State. This is the only condition that
the Constitution prescribes in this behalf.
6. It seems to us that in the context of the other
provisions of the Constitution referred to above
there is no reason why the plain words of clause
(4) of Article 164 should be cut down in any
manner and confined to a case where a Minister
loses for some reason his seat in the Legislature of
the State. We are assured that the meaning we
have given to clause (4) of Article 164 is the
correct one from the proceedings of the
Constituent Assembly and the position as it
obtains in England, Australia and South Africa.”
The Court set out the position as it obtained in England,
Australia and South Africa and observed that this showed
that Article 164(4) had “an ancient lineage”.
57. We are aware that the finding that the second
respondent could not have been sworn in as the Chief
Minister and cannot continue to function as such will have
serious consequences. Not only will it mean that the State
has had no validly appointed Chief Minister since 14-5-
2001, when the second respondent was sworn in, but also
that it has had no validly appointed Council of Ministers,
for the Council of Ministers was appointed on the
recommendation of the second respondent. It would also
mean that all acts of the Government of Tamil Nadu since
14-5-2001 would become questionable. To alleviate these
consequences and in the interest of the administration of
the State and its people, who would have acted on the
premise that the appointments were legal and valid, we
propose to invoke the de facto doctrine and declare that all
acts, otherwise legal and valid, performed between 14-5-
2001 and today by the second respondent as Chief
Minister, by the members of the Council of Ministers and
by the Government of the State shall not be adversely
affected by reason only of the order that we now propose to
pass. .......”
(xxii) (2012) 6 SCC 792 [Best Sellers Retail (India) (P) Ltd. v.
Aditya Birla Nuvo Ltd.] wherein the Hon'ble Supreme Court held as
“ ..... 29. Yet, the settled principle of law is that even
where prima facie case is in favour of the plaintiff, the
Court will refuse temporary injunction if the injury suffered
by the plaintiff on account of refusal of temporary
injunction was not irreparable.
30. In Dalpat Kumar v. Prahlad Singh [(1992) 1
SCC 719] this Court held: (SCC p. 721, para 5)
“5. … Satisfaction that there is a prima facie
case by itself is not sufficient to grant injunction.
The Court further has to satisfy that non-
interference by the Court would result in
‘irreparable injury’ to the party seeking relief and
that there is no other remedy available to the party
except one to grant injunction and he needs
protection from the consequences of apprehended
injury or dispossession. Irreparable injury,
however, does not mean that there must be no
physical possibility of repairing the injury, but
means only that the injury must be a material one,
namely, one that cannot be adequately
(xxiii) (1992) 1 SCC 719 [ Dalpat Kumar v. Prahlad Singh
wherein the Hon'ble Supreme Court held as follows:-
“.........5. Therefore, the burden is on the plaintiff by
evidence aliunde by affidavit or otherwise that there is “a
prima facie case” in his favour which needs adjudication at
the trial. The existence of the prima facie right and
infraction of the enjoyment of his property or the right is a
condition for the grant of temporary injunction. Prima facie
case is not to be confused with prima facie title which has
to be established, on evidence at the trial. Only prima facie
case is a substantial question raised, bona fide, which needs
investigation and a decision on merits. Satisfaction that
there is a prima facie case by itself is not sufficient to grant
injunction. The Court further has to satisfy that non-
interference by the Court would result in “irreparable
injury” to the party seeking relief and that there is no other
remedy available to the party except one to grant injunction
and he needs protection from the consequences of
apprehended injury or dispossession. Irreparable injury,
however, does not mean that there must be no physical
possibility of repairing the injury, but means only that the
injury must be a material one, namely one that cannot be
adequately compensated by way of damages. The third
condition also is that “the balance of convenience” must be
in favour of granting injunction. The Court while granting
or refusing to grant injunction should exercise sound
judicial discretion to find the amount of substantial mischief
or injury which is likely to be caused to the parties, if the
injunction is refused and compare it with that which is
likely to be caused to the other side if the injunction is
granted. If on weighing competing possibilities or
probabilities of likelihood of injury and if the Court
considers that pending the suit, the subject matter should be
maintained in status quo, an injunction would be issued.
Thus the Court has to exercise its sound judicial discretion
in granting or refusing the relief of ad interim injunction
pending the suit. ..........”
(xxiv) 1990 Supp (1) SCC 727 [Wander Ltd. And Anr. vs
Antox India P. Ltd               ] wherein the Hon'ble Supreme Court held as
“.......... 14. The appeals before the Division Bench
were against the exercise of discretion by the Single Judge.
In such appeals, the Appellate Court will not interfere with
the exercise of discretion of the court of first instance and
substitute its own discretion except where the discretion has
been shown to have been exercised arbitrarily, or
capriciously or perversely or where the court had ignored
the settled principles of law regulating grant or refusal of
interlocutory injunctions. An appeal against exercise of
discretion is said to be an appeal on principle. Appellate
Court will not reassess the material and seek to reach a
conclusion different from the one reached by the court
below if the one reached by the court was reasonably
possible on the material. The appellate court would
normally not be justified in interfering with the exercise of
discretion under appeal solely on the ground that if it had
considered the matter at the trial stage it would have come
to a contrary conclusion. If the discretion has been
exercised by the Trial Court reasonably and in a judicial
manner the fact that the appellate court would have taken a
different view may not justify interference with the trial
court's exercise of discretion. After referring to these
principles Gajendragadkar, J. in Printers (Mysore) Private
Ltd. v. Pothan Joseph :
... These principles are well established, but
as has been observed by Viscount Simon in Charles
Osention & Co. v. Johnston the law as to the
reversal by a court of appeal of an order made by a
judge below in the exercise of his discretion is well
established, and any difficulty that arises is due
only to the application of well settled principles in
an individual case.
The appellate judgment does not seem to defer to this
principle. .........”
14.1 The learned Senior Counsels appearing for the 1 st respondent
in O.S.A.No.227 of 2022, the 4th respondent in O.S.A.Nos. 231 and 232
of 2022 and the learned counsel appearing for the 1st respondent in
O.S.A.Nos. 231 and 232 of 2022, made the following submissions:-
(i) Notice of invitation dated 26.06.2022 to attend the meeting on
27.06.2022 was neither signed nor authorised by both the Co-Ordinator
and Joint Co-Ordinator and it is against the Rule 20A(v) of the Bye-
Laws of the Party.             As per Rule 26 of the Bye-Laws of the Party, the
Party Headquarters' Secretary has no power to convene any meeting. On
the contrary, only              the Co-Ordinator and Joint Co-Ordinator of the
Party have power to convene the meeting. Under Rule 20A(v), if 1/5 th of
the Members of the General Council request the Co-Ordinator and Joint
Co-Ordinator to convene the Special Meeting, it is obligatory on the part
of the Co-Ordinator and Joint Co-Ordinator to do so within 30 days of
receipt of such a requisition.     No other Office Bearer or Member of the
General Council is vested with the power to convene the Meeting even in
the absence of the Co-Ordinator and Joint Co-Ordinator. Notice issued
to the 1st respondent by the 6th respondent inviting him to the General
Council Meeting to be held on 11.07.2022 is illegal. As per                     Rule
20A(vii), 6th respondent can only be permitted to hold office and continue
to function till the new Co-Ordinator and Joint Co-Ordinator are elected
and assume office.
(ii) The General Council can only alter, amend or delete any Bye-
Laws so far as it might be consistent with the fundamental principles
upon which the Party is formed. It is not open to the Members of the
General Counsel to alter the basic structure of the Party Constitution.
The General Council did not have the power to assume and declare that
the Co-Ordinator and Joint CO-Ordinator had automatically lapsed on
(iii) In respect of the Resolution of election of Mr.Tamil Magan
Hussain as Permanent Presidium Chairman, the Proposer is stated to be
the appellant          in his capacity as “Joint Co-Ordinator”.              The said
Resolution was seconded by two other General Council Members and
the 1st respondent was not a Proposer or a Party to the said Resolution.
The learned Single Judge has rightly held that the 1st respondent-plaintiff
has made out a prima facie case. The notice calling for the General
Council Meeting on 11.07.2022 is bad in law. The grant of relief of
status quo ante as on 23.06.2022 was proper, in the light of the specific
defence taken by the appellant before the learned Single Judge that the
posts of Co-Ordinator            and Joint Co-Ordinator had fallen vacant on
14.2 The learned Senior Counsels, in support of their submissions
have relied upon the following Judgments.:-
(i) 1990 Supp SCC 727 [Wander Ltd. v. Antox India (P) Ltd.,]
wherein the Hon'ble Supreme Court held as follows:-
“ .....7. The case of Antox is that its agreement dated
March 28, 1986 with Wander Ltd. was itself void in that its
object was one forbidden by law; that it would, if permitted,
defeat and violate several statutory provisions and
prohibitions; that the agreement thus, out of way, the
undertaking furnished on June 21, 1986 by Wander Ltd. to
the Drug Controller in Karnataka, had the effect, in law, of
and amounted to an abandonment by Wander Ltd. of its
proprietorship of the registered trademark “Cal-De-Ce” and
of all such exclusive rights as Wander Ltd. had or may have
had in respect of that trademark and that the subsequent
continued user of the said trademark by Antox under the
Drug Controller's licence amounted to an independent user
of the trademark by Antox in its own right as, indeed,
according to Antox, the said trademark after its
abandonment by Wander Ltd. came to be in a nascent
unowned condition eligible to be picked up and used by
anybody. It was said that the user of the trademark by
Antox after June 21, 1986 amounted to such an
independent user on the strength of which Antox claimed
that it was entitled to maintain a passing-off action even
against Wander Ltd. The mere earlier registration of the
trademark by Wander Ltd., it is urged, is no evidence of
earlier user and with the abandonment of the trademark by
Wander Ltd. Antox is entitled, on the strength of its
continuous user, to restrain Wander Ltd. from manufacture.
8.The point for consideration is whether there is a
prima facie case on which Antox could be held entitled to
restrain Wander Ltd. and Alfred Berg from manufacturing
and marketing goods under the trade name “Cal-De-Ce”
and whether on considerations of balance of convenience
and comparative hardship a temporary injunction should
issue. The corollary is that even if the injunction sought by
Antox is refused, that does not, ipso facto, entitle Wander
Ltd. and Alfred Berg to manufacture and market the goods
if they are not otherwise entitled to do so under the relevant
laws regulating the matter. .....”
(ii) In an unreported judgment dated 06.10.2015, made in CRP
No.22(AP) of 2015           [The Arunachal Pradesh Congress Committee
(APCC), Arunachal Pradesh and another v. Shri Kalikho Pul], the
Single Judge of the Gauhati High Court dealt with the maintainability of
the Civil Suit and ultimately held that the suit filed by a member of Indian
National Congress is maintainable.
15. Challenging the common order passed by the learned Single
Judge in O.A.Nos.368, 370 and 379 of 2022 in C.S.Nos.118 and 119 of
2022, the 5th defendant in C.S.No.118 of 2022, who is also the 4th
defendant in C.S.No.119 of 2022, have filed the above Original Side
16. On a careful consideration of the materials available on record,
the submissions made by the learned Senior Counsels appearing for both
sides and also taking into consideration the Judgments relied upon by the
learned counsels, it could be seen that the dispute between the appellant
and the 1st respondent (in O.S.A. No.227 of 2022) is in connection with
the intra-party rivalry over the question who had to lead the Political
Party called AIADMK. It is not in dispute that the Party was launched
in the year 1972 by its founder Late Mr.M.G.Ramachandran. When he
launched the Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam on 17.10.1972, he
ensured that the General Council of the Party would be the Supreme
body among the party organs, and the General Secretary of the party to
be elected by the Primary Members and the General Secretary will head
the party with unfettered powers. The Party Bye-Law was accordingly
drafted. Rule 20, Rule 42 and Rule 43 of the Bye-Law vested the ultimate
administrative responsibility with the General Secretary, including power
of exemption to the Rules and Regulations, except the mode of electing
the General Secretary, which should be by the Primary Members of the
Party. Rule 43 prohibited any change or amendment to the above mode
of electing the General Secretary.
17. After the demise of Mr.M.G.Ramachandran, there was a split
in the party and later they joined together and were functioning under the
leadership of Selvi J.Jayalaithaa as the General Secretary of the Party.
About 25 years ago, this Party faced a similar situation as it is now
undergoing. When the then Deputy General Secretary of the Party
Mr.S.Thirunavukkarasu, who was expelled from the Party, sought to
convene the General Council Meeting alleging that the General Secretary
is inaccessible to the Party Men, Selvi J.Jayalalithaa filed a Civil Suit
before      this Court seeking for an order of injunction restraining
Mr. S.Thirunavukkarasu from convening the General Council Meeting.
Selvi J.Jayalalithaa as General Secretary of this Party, in the year 2011,
made certain amendments to the Party constitution and it was in force
till 11.09.2017. Selvi J.Jayalalithaa   had expired on 05.12.2016 and
thereafter, some provisions of the Bye-Laws were amended                       on
12.09.2017 and on 01.12.2021.
18. On 01.12.2021, the Executive Council Meeting of the Party
was held in which Resolution in respect of the Amendment to the Party
Constitution Rule 20 (ii), Rule 43 and Rule 45 was approved. The
Election Notification for the posts of Co-Ordinator and Joint Co-
Ordinator by Single Vote was issued i.e., both the appellant and the 1st
respondent in O.S.A.No.227 o f 2022 contested for the posts of Co-
Ordinator and Joint Co-Ordinator respectively on a “Single Ticket”, i.e.,
the Members casted a Single Vote for electing the Co-Ordinator and
Joint Co-Ordinator jointly. When they were elected jointly on a “Single
Ticket”, they cannot perform their duties individually i.e., neither the Co-
Ordinator nor the Joint Co-Ordinator can act independently without the
support of the other.
19. The appellant has sent a letter dated 28.06.2022 to the Election
Commission of India stating that the posts of Co-Ordinator and the Joint
Co-Ordinator had lapsed for the reason that their election on 01.12.2021
was not ratified in the General Council Meeting held on 23.06.2022.
The appellant has addressed the said letter dated 28.06.2022 to the
Election Commission of India as the Headquarters' Secretary and not as
the Joint Co-Ordinator of the Party. When the appellant has addressed
the letter to the Election Commission of India as Headquarters Secretary
stating that the posts of Co-Ordinator and the Joint Co-Ordinator had
lapsed, it implies that he is no longer Joint Co-Ordinator of the AIADMK
Party.       When the appellant has relinquished        the post of Joint Co-
Ordinator, either by lapse or by his own act, he cannot be compelled to
continue as Joint Co-Ordinator. When the appellant is no longer the Joint
Co-Ordinator of the Political Party, the 1st respondent in O.S.A.No.227 of
2022 also cannot act independently as Co-Ordinator for the reason that
both of them were elected to the posts of the Co-Ordinator and the Joint
Co-Ordinator in “Single Ticket”. Since the Joint Co-Ordinator, by his
letter dated 28.06.2022 addressed to the Election Commission of India,
gave up his post as Joint Co-Ordinator, the Co-Ordinator cannot act
separately. In these circumstances, the contention of the appellant that
the posts of Co-Ordinator and Joint Co-Ordinator had lapsed for want of
ratification need not be gone into in the above appeals and the said issue
can be decided in the pending suit in C.S.Nos. 118 and 119 of 2022.
20. There was no separate election for the post of Co-Ordinator
and Joint Co-Ordinator. There was no other nomination received except
from the appellant and from the 1st respondent (in O.S.A.No.227 of
2022). Hence, they were declared as Co-ordinator and Joint Co-ordinator
elected unopposed on 04.12.2021. Thereafter, the election for the other
Organs of the Party including the General Council was held. After
completing the Party Organ Election, the same was intimated to the
Election Commission of India as mandated under the Representation of
People Act, 1951 and the Rules framed thereunder.
21. The appellant and the 1st respondent (in O.S.A.No.227 of
2022) as Co-Ordinator and Joint Co-Ordinator, by letter dated
02.06.2022, jointly communicated to the Executive Council Members and
the General Council Members that there will be Executive Council
Meeting and General Council Meeting on 23.06.2022 presided by the
temporary Presidium Chairman Mr.A.Thamizl Magan Hussain. When the
Draft Resolutions for the said Executive Council Meeting and the General
Council Meeting was sent to the Co-ordinator, he consented for placing
the Draft Resolutions Nos.1 to 23 for consideration in the proposed
Executive Council Meeting and the General Council Meeting.                 Since
there was a demand in respect of the Single Leadership             among the
Members of the Party, one of the General Council Member filed a Civil
Suit in C.S.No.111 of 2022 seeking for an order of injunction of the
proposed        Executing Council Meeting and General Council Meeting
scheduled to be held on 23.06.2022. The learned Single Judge, by order
dated 22.06.2022, declined to grant an order of injunction, hence, the
plaintiff therein filed an Original Side Appeal in O.S.A.No.160 of 2022
challenging the order of the learned Single Judge. This Court, by order
dated 23.06.2022 in C.M.P. No.9962 of 2022 in O.S.A.No.160 of 2022,
while ordering notice to the respondents 1 to 3, passed the following
“ .... 9. However, the submission made by the learned
Senior Counsel appearing for the 5th respondent cannot be
accepted for the reason that the draft resolution containing
23 items that were to be discussed and decided in the
General Council        Meeting scheduled to be held on
23.06.2022 was approved by the 4th respondent on
22.06.2022, i.e. prior to the date of the General Council
Meeting. Therefore, by the approval given by the 4 th
respondent on 22.06.2022, it is clear that subjects that are to
be discussed and decided in the General Council Meeting
requires his approval.
10. Mr. S.R.Rajagopal, learned counsel who is also
appearing for the 5th respondent submitted that the Original
Side Appeal filed against the interim order passed by the
learned Single Judge is not maintainable for the reason that
though the learned Single Judge had passed a detailed order
in the applications, ultimately he ordered notice to the
respondents returnable by 11.07.2022, hence, the Original
Side Appeal filed as against the said order is not
maintainable. However, we made it clear to the learned
counsel      that the said     submission with regard to
maintainability can by made by him at the time of hearing
the Original Side Appeal.
11. Since the draft resolution approved by the
respondents 4 and 5 does not contain an item with regard to
the amendment of the            Rule-20A 1 to 13, 45 and 45,
we are of the view that the appellant has made out a prima
facie case for the grant of an order of interim injunction. In
the event of not granting any interim order in the above
petition, the appellant and the 4th respondent would be
greatly prejudiced. Further, if an order of injunction is not
granted, the prayer sought for in the suit will become
infructuous.     We are also of the view that the interim
injunction sought for by the petitioner to prohibit the
respondents from conducting the General Council Meeting
cannot be granted. However, the General Council can
discuss and take decisions only with regard to 23 items
mentioned in the draft resolution, which has been approved
by the respondents 4 and 5. The respondents shall not take
any decision apart from the 23 items mentioned in the draft
resolution The General Council are at liberty to discuss
any other matter apart from the 23 items mentioned in the
draft resolution, however, no decision shall be taken in the
General Council Meeting with regard to the same.
12. In the result, we permit the respondents 4 and 5 to
convene the General Council Meeting at 10.00 a.m. on
23.06.2022 and we also permit the General Council to
discuss and take any decision as per the Rules and Bye-
Laws with regard to 23 items mentioned in the draft
resolution and we make it clear that the respondents shall not
take any decision other than the 23 items mentioned in the
draft resolution. The members of the General Council are at
liberty to discuss any other matter, however, no decision
should be taken in the General Council with regard to the
same. .....”
By the above order,          this Court directed the conduct of the General
Council Meeting and also permitted the General Council to decide the
23 Draft Resolutions approved by the Co-Ordinator and the Joint Co-
Ordinator.    However, restrictions were imposed to decide any               new
resolution, apart from the 23 Draft Resolutions.   When O.S.A.No.160 of
2022 came up for hearing along with the Miscellaneous Petitions on
04.07.2022, this Court made it clear that the interim order passed on
23.06.2022 pertains only to the General Council Meeting scheduled to be
held on 23.06.2022 and that it cannot be extended for an indefinite
period.    Further, this Court also observed      that this Court is not
expressing any opinion with regard to the General Council Meeting
scheduled to be held on 11.07.2022. Subsequently, on 07.07.2022 also,
in view of the order of stay granted by the Apex Court in
S.L.P.No.223167 of 2022, dismissed the Miscellaneous Petitions in
C.M.P. Nos.10411, 10416, 10417 and 10418 of 2022 filed by the 1st
respondent (in O.S.A No.227 of 2022) seeking (i)             to implead the
proposed respondents in the       O.S.A.No.160/2022; (ii) to punish the
respondents for disobeying the order dated 23.06.2022; (iii) to grant an
order of interim injunction restraining the respondents from conducting
the General Council Meeting scheduled to be held on 11.07.2022 for the
implementation of any decisions ; and (iv) to grant an order of interim
stay of the appointment of the 8th respondent as the Permanent Presidium
Chairman in the General Council Meeting held on 23.06.2022.
22. After passing of the   order dated 23.06.2022,            the 5th
respondent-Mr.A.Thamizh        Magan    Hussain,     was      announced         as
Permanent Presidium Chairman in the General Council Meeting held on
23.06.2022. In the        General Council Meeting, 2190 Members gave a
written requisition for convening the General Council Meeting. In the
presence of the appellant and the 1st respondent (Co-Ordinator and Joint
Co-Ordinator), an announcement was made in the meeting that the next
General Council Meeting would be held on 11.07.2022.
23. Challenging the order dated 23.06.2022 passed in C.M.P.
No.9962 of 2022 in O.S.A.No.160 of 2022, the appellant preferred an
appeal before the Hon'ble Supreme Court in S.L.P (Civil) No.11237 of
2022 and the Apex Court, by order dated 06.07.2022, granted an order of
interim stay of the order dated 23.06.2022 made in C.M.P. No.9962 of
2022 in O.S.A.No.160 of 2022.        The Special Leave Petition is pending
before the Hon'ble Supreme Court. Thereafter, the 1 st respondent in the
above Original Side Appeals filed Civil Suits in C.S.Nos. 118 of 2022 and
119 of 2022 seeking for the prayers mentioned above. In the said suits,
the 1st respondent filed applications in O.A.Nos. 368, 370 and 379 of
2022 for grant of injunction as mentioned above. The learned                        Single
Judge, by order dated 11.07.2022, declined to grant an order of interim
injunction and permitted the appellant to conduct the General Council
Meeting on 11.07.2022. By virtue of the order dated 06.07.2022 passed
by the Hon'ble Supreme Court and the order passed by the learned Single
Judge, the General Council Meeting was conducted on 11.07.2022.
24. Challenging the order           dated    11.07.2022 passed by the
learned Single Judge the 1st respondent                filed    an appeal before the
Hon'ble Supreme Court in S.L.P. (C) Nos. 12785, 12783 of 2022 and the
Hon'ble Supreme Court, by order dated 29.07.2022, passed the following
“1. Exemption applications are allowed.
2. Heard learned Senior Advocates for the parties at considerable
length.
3. From the record, it appears that some of the parties to the
underlying dispute pending before the High Court of Madras,
filed Special Leave Petitions, being Special Leave Petition (C)
No. 11237 of 2022, Special Leave Petition (C) No.11578 of
2022 and Special Leave Petition (C) No. 11579 of 2022, before
this Court. These petitions were listed before this Court on
06.07.2022, when this Court passed certain directions, inter alia,
relating to the meeting of the General Council of respondent no.
1 to be conducted on 11.07.2022.
4. The petitioners presently before this Court filed civil suits
challenging, inter alia, holding of the meeting of the General
Council of respondent no. 1 dated 11.07.2022 and sought interim
reliefs in the pending suits. However, vide the impugned order,
rather than adjudicating on the interim reliefs, it appears that the
learned Single Judge of the High Court of Madras has not
adjudicated upon the reliefs sought. Rather, the learned Single
Judge held as follows:
“11. Having heard the learned counsel for parties, this Court
finds considerable force in the contentions put forth by the
learned Senior counsel for the respondent/defendant. At the
outset, it is pertinent to note that the Hon'ble Supreme Court has
in unequivocal terms, observed that the Meeting of the General
Council of the respondent No.3 slated to be held on 11.07.2022
is concerned, the same may proceed in accordance with law.
Therefore, having regard to the direction of the Hon'ble Supreme
Court, this Court cannot take a contrary decision by interpreting
the same as technically projected by the learned Senior counsel
for the applicants, stating that if the applicants make out a prima
facie case that the General Council meeting is not in accordance
with law, this Court can very well interfere and override the
direction of the Hon'ble Supreme Court and pass orders
injuncting the respondents/defendants from convening the
meeting. This Court is unable to fortify the contention put forth
by the learned Senior counsel for the applicants rather amazed,
for more than one reason, firstly, in the order, the Hon'ble
Supreme Court observed that the learned single Judge can decide
the issue regarding the convening of the General Council meeting
on 11.07.2022 without bearing in mind the direction already
given by the Hon'ble Supreme Court; secondly, no other interim
relief has been sought for before this Court by the applicants
apart from not to convene the meeting, to examine and pass
necessary orders by this Court; thirdly, since the order has been
passed permitting the respondents/defendants to convene the
meeting, if at all, the same is not proceeded in accordance with
law as projected by the learned Senior counsel for the applicants,
being custodian of the order, it is for the Hon'ble Supreme Court
to consider this aspect of the matter and not by this Court;
fourthly, all the grounds which were vehemently raised before
this Court on behalf of the applicants regarding the subject
meeting is not going to be proceeded in accordance with law,
were in fact, very well available at the time of passing of the
order by the Hon'ble Supreme Court and this Court fails to
understand as to why the applicants have not brought the same to
the notice of the Hon'ble Supreme Court by way of review and
seek modification of the order instead calling upon this Court to
sit over and interpret the order of the Hon'ble Supreme Court,
which, being inferior and abiding by law of precedent, this Court
is not inclined to venture upon such course and pass contrary
orders.”
5. From the above, it is clear that the learned single judge has
taken the view that, by virtue of the earlier order dated
06.07.2022 passed by this Court, he is unable to properly
adjudicate the matters. However, a perusal of the order dated
06.07.2022 indicates no such restriction on the power
or discretion of the High Court.
6. Taking into consideration the above, we are of the considered
view that it would be appropriate to remand this issue to the High
Court for reconsideration, without being influenced by any of the
orders passed by this Court either in the present Special Leave
Petitions or in Special Leave Petition (C) No. 11237 of 2022,
Special Leave Petition (C) No.11578 of 2022 and Special Leave
Petition (C) No. 11579 of 2022 respectively.
7. We request the High Court to dispose of the said matters,
pending adjudication before it, expeditiously and preferably
within a period of two weeks reckoned from the date of
communication of a copy of this order.
8. Till the High Court hears the matters, statusquo as it exists
today shall be maintained by the parties.
9. Before parting with these matters, we make it clear that we
have not expressed any opinion on the merits of the case. It is
further clarified that the statusquo order being granted today,
shall not be construed as an expression of any opinion by this
Court on the merits of the case. The High Court shall deal with,
and decide, the matters on their own merits in accordance with
10. The Special Leave Petitions and all the pending applications
are disposed of on the above terms.”
From the order passed by the Hon'ble Supreme Court, it is clear that the
Hon'ble Supreme Court, directed the parties to maintain status quo as on
29.07.2022 i.e., the date on which the order was passed till the High
Court hears the matter.
25. After remand, the learned Single Judge took up the applications
in O.A.Nos. 368, 270 and 379             of 2022 and passed the order on
11.08.2022 with the directions mentioned above. The said order is
being challenged in the above Original Side Appeals.
26. The learned Single Judge while disposing of the applications,
formulated three points for considerations viz.
(1).Whether the plaintiff have locus
Meeting dated 11.07.2022 was convened by the
person authorised to convene the Meeting ?
(3). In whose favour the prima facie case
The learned Single Judge decided all the three points in favour of the 1 st
27. So far as the maintainability of the suits are concerned, it
cannot be stated that a Civil Court in a Civil Suit cannot interfere with
the intra party happenings when there is a dispute in the Political Party.
It is always open to the aggrieved party to file a Civil Suit unless there is
a bar either under the Civil Procedure Code or under a Special Act.
When a case is made out that the civil right of a Member of the Party is
affected, the Civil Court cannot decline to interfere and per se grant
approval to the act of the aggrieved person. Further in respect of the
very same Political Party, in the past, several suits were filed and in
none of the proceedings, the court has come to the conclusion that the suit
is not maintainable. The members of the Political Party are not enjoying
any immunity from appearing before the competent Civil Court. Under
Section 9 of the Code of Civil Procedure, all suits of civil nature can be
entertained by a Civil Court unless such a suit is expressly, or by
necessary implication, barred.     So far as non filing of Order 1 Rule 8 is
concerned, the Civil Procedure Code         does not prescribe any stage at
which the application can be filed.      When the 1 st respondent/plaintiffs
are aggrieved over the conduct of the General Council Meeting, there is
no bar to seek redressal from the Civil Court for protecting their right.
Every Civil Suit is cognizable unless it is barred and there is an inherent
right in every person to bring a suit of a civil nature and unless the suit is
barred by statute one may, at one's peril, bring a suit of one's choice. It is
no answer to a suit, howsoever frivolous the claim, the law confers such
right to sue. The basic principle of a civilised jurisprudence that absence
of machinery for enforcement of right renders it nugatory.                  In the
judgment reported in (1997) 3 CTC 229 (cited supra) the Division
Bench of this court while dealing with a case relating to the very same
Political Party also held that the suit filed by Selvi J.Jayalalithaa to
restrain the conduct of General Council Meeting is maintainable. The
learned Single Judge has rightly held that the 1st respondent-plaintiff
has locus standi to maintain the suit. We do not find any ground to
interfere with the findings with regard to the Point No.1 of the learned
28. So far as the contention with regard to the convening of the
General Council Meeting is concerned, the General Council Meeting was
convened by the appellant and the 1st respondent (in O.S.A.No.227 of
2022) on 23.06.2022. The appellant and the 1st respondent were also
very much present in the General Council Meeting on 23.06.2022. By
order dated 23.06.2022 made in            C.M.P. No.9962 of 2022 in
O.S.A.No.160 of 2022, this Court permitted the General Council to
decide 23 Draft Resolutions and also permitted the Members to discuss
other matters, however, restrained them from taking any final decision
apart from 23 Draft Resolutions. In the said meeting, 2190 members
gave written request to conduct General Council Meeting. Based on the
said letter, it was announced in the General Council Meeting itself that
the next General Council Meeting would be conducted on 11.07.2022. It
is pertinent to note that the 1st respondent was very much present at the
time of such announcement. As per Rule 19(vii) of the Bye-Law of the
Party, the General Council Meeting should be convened every year or as
and when the Co-Ordinator and the Joint Co-Ordinator consider it
necessary by giving 15 days notice in advance of the meeting.                The
quoram for the meeting shall be 1/5th of the total number of Members of
the General Council. If 1/5th of the members of the General Council
requests the Co-Ordinator and               Joint Co-Ordinator to convene the
Special General Council Meeting, they should do so within 30 days on
receipt of such representation. It would be appropriate to extract 19(vii)
of the Bye-Law both in Tamil and English version.
Rule 19(vii) reads as follows:-
gpupT -7: fofg; nghJf;FOf; $l;lk;   Part – vii :- The General Council Meeting
Mz;Lf;F xU Kiw my;yJ fofg;

xUq;fpizg;ghsh; $l;l Ntz;Lk;.         ordinator and Joint Co-ordinator to convene
the Special Meeting of the General Council,
the Co-ordinator and Joint Co-ordinator
should do so within 30 days of the receipt of
such a requisition.
On a reading of Rule 19(vii),it could be seen that the first part deals with
the regular General Council Meeting which should be convened once in a
year and in respect of the General Council Meeting convened at the
instance of the Co-Ordinator and the Joint Co-Ordinator. For conducting
such meeting, the first part of Rule 19(vii) stipulates giving 15 days
notice in advance of the date of meeting. Rule 19(vii) does not provide for
any written notice for convening a meeting. The second part                      of
Rule 19(vii) deals with the quoram for the meeting, which shall be 1/5 th
of the total number of members of the General Council. For convening
the Special     General Council Meeting at the request of 1/5th of the
Members of the General Council, the same should be convened within
30 days of the receipt of such a requisition by the Co-ordinator and Joint
Co-ordinator. The second part does not provide for giving any notice to
the members of the General Council. For a requisitioner's meeting of the
General Council, Rule 19(vii) does not provide for any notice unlike the
regular General Council Meeting, which requires 15 days of advance
notice.    The Tamil version of the Bye-Laws clearly demarcates the
difference between a regular General Council Meeting and a Special
General Council Meeting based on requisition of members.. The Tamil
Version of the Bye-Law refers to the regular meeting and states ”nkw;go
Tl;lj;jpw;F 15 ehl;fs; Kd; mwptpg;g[ bfhLf;f ntz;Lk;” ,
while there is no such stipulation for the Special Meeting called by the
requisitioners.   For both the Meetings, the Bye-Laws                 does not
contemplate written notice to be issued. The notice mentioned in Rule
19(vii) is that of the meeting and not a notice to each member. It is clear
that the notice can be by way of publication, affixing at notice board,
announcement, etc. In the case on hand, notice of Special General
Council Meeting was by announcement in the 23.06.2022 meeting.
Therefore, the notice given by announcement on 23.06.2022 was a due
notice for convening the          Special General Council Meeting on
11.07.2022. When the notice for             General Council Meeting on
12.09.2017 was issued by the Headquarters office Bearers on
28.08.2017, the announcement made at the floor of the General Council
Meeting on 23.06.2022 for convening Special General Council Meeting
on 11.07.2022 can be construed as a proper notice. The word “notice”,
denotes merely an intimation to the party concerned of a particular fact.
It cannot be limited to “notice in writing” and only to a letter. A notice
may take several forms. Even assuming that the notice suffers from
procedural irregularity, it is always open to the members of the General
Council to ratify, as long as there is a substantive right/function
underlying in the notice. This ratio has been laid down by the Hon'ble
Supreme Court in the judgment reported in AIR 1962 SC 666 (cited
supra).
29. Had the Framers of the Bye-Laws thought of giving 15 days
notice even for the convening of the Special General Council Meeting at
the request of 1/5th of the General Council members, they would have
incorporated giving 15 days notice at the end of the second part of Rule
19( vii). The mentioning of giving 15 days notice in the first part would
establish the intention of the framers of the Bye-Law was to give notice to
the members of the General Council only in respect of the regular Annual
General Council Meeting and for the General Council Meeting convened
at the instance of the Co-Ordinator and the Joint Co-Ordinator. Since the
Special General Council Meeting are being convened at the request of the
members of the General Council, there will not be any necessity for
giving another notice to the members again for convening the Special
General Council Meeting.        If 15 days notice is again given even for
convening Special General Council Meeting at the request of 1/5th of the
members of the General Council, it leads to a situation where the meeting
can be convened only between 16th and 30th day.
30. Admittedly, the Agenda   for the meeting was issued on
01.07.2022. On 23.06.2022 itself a decision has been taken to convene
a meeting on 11.07.2022.        The requisition for convening a          Special
General Council Meeting signed by 2190 General Council members was
addressed to the Presidium Chairman, Co-Ordinator and                 Joint Co-
Ordinator and the same was given to the Presidium Chairman. It cannot
be disputed       that   for convening the General Council Meeting on
23.06.2022 necessarily there should be a Presidium Chairman. In the
absence of       Presidium Chairman, a meeting cannot be convened.
Therefore, 2190 members gave a requisition for convening a Special
General Council Meeting to the Presidium Chairman for the reason that
there was a rift between the Co-Ordinator and the Joint Co-Ordinator. As
already stated, the announcement with regard to the next General Council
Meeting on 11.07.2022 was made in the presence of the 1 st respondent
and also in the presence of about 2500 members. It is not the case of the
1st respondent that they did not know about the announcement made in
the floor of the General Council Meeting on 23.06.2022. Though Rule
19(vii) says that the Co-Ordinator and the Joint Co-Ordinator should
convene the Special General Council Meeting within 30 days from the
date of receipt of the requisition by its 1/5th General Council members,
since the Co-Ordinator and the Joint Co-Ordinator are at loggerheads,
they were not in a position to convene the Special General Council
Meeting jointly. Since the Co-Ordinator and the Joint Co-Ordinator are
at loggerheads one cannot expect them to jointly convene the Special
General Council Meeting and if the 2nd part of rule 19(vii) of the Bye-
Law is strictly applied then it would result in a deadlock situation. If
either the Co-Ordinator or the Joint Co-Ordinator is not co-operating for
convening the General Council Meeting, it would lead to a situation
where no General Council Meeting could be convened.
31. In the judgment reported in (1997) 3 CTC 229 (cited supra) the
expelled member from the AIADMK Party viz., Mr.S.Thirunavukkarasu
called for a General Council Meeting, parallel meeting to the meeting
called by the then General Secretary Selvi J.Jayalalithaa. The General
Secretary         approached this Court seeking for an order of interim
injunction against the convening of parallel meeting and the same was
granted in her favour. Therefore, the facts surrounding the said judgment
is completely different to the facts of the present case. In the case on
hand, there was no parallel meeting called for by any of the Members.
The ratio laid down by the Hon'ble Division Bench of this Court reported
in (1997) 3 CTC 229 (cited supra) cannot be applied to the facts and
circumstances of the present case.            It cannot be said as a general rule
that the requisitioners have no option but to go to Court if the leaders do
not call for a meeting. Such a statement would be undemocratic and
illegal. When the Interim General Secretary could not act in the year
2017, the Office Bearers stepped in to convene the meeting on
12.09.2018 based on the requisition received.
32. It is not in dispute that the General Secretary was given power
to convene the General Council Meeting.                After the death of Selvi
J.Jayalalithaa, Mrs.V.K.Sasikala was appointed as the Interim General
Secretary and she could not perform as Interim General Secretary in the
year 2017 because of her incarceration in a criminal case. Therefore, the
Office Bearers convened the meeting on 12.09.2017 based on the
requisition made by the Members. A similar situation has arisen now,
(i.e.) since       the Co-Ordinator and the Joint Co-Ordinator are in
loggerheads, the calling for the meeting by the Presidum Chairman on
23.06.2022 at the floor of the General Council Meeting cannot be termed
as illegal.
33. Admittedly, there is a functional deadlock in the Party due to
the stand taken by the appellant and the 1st respondent (in O.S.A.No.227
of 2022). Rules 5, 19(i) and 19(viii) are absolutely clear that the General
Council is the Supreme body of the Party.          As per the By-laws of the
Party, the Executive Council has not been given power either to amend
the Rules or to take any important decision. If such decision is taken,
the same should be approved by the General Council of the Party. Even
if the Leaders take any decision or action apart from what has been
specifically provided to them under the Rules and Regulations, they have
to be ratified at the General Council. The supremacy of the General
Council is because it is elected ultimately by the Primary Members in
terms of Rules 6 to 14 of the Bye-Laws.
34. As already stated, the General Council consists of 2665
members, who were elected through the Organizational Elections under
Rules 6 to 14 of the By-laws. The elected General Council Members
represent the Primary Members of the Party. It cannot be disputed that
the General Council is the Supreme Body in the party. As per Rules 19 (i)
and 19(viii) of the Bye-Laws, the General Council was given authority to
decide on the policy matters. As per Rule 43 of the Bye-Laws, the
General Council was given power to amend the Bye-Laws. The General
Council held on 11.07.2022 was a requisitioners' special meeting under
Rule 19(vii) of the Bye-Laws. As already stated, 2190 members have
made the requisition for convening a special General Council Meeting.
The requisition given at the General Council Meeting on 23.06.2022 was
announced at the floor of the meeting, informing the members that a
General Council Meeting would be convened on 11.07.2022. The
requisition made by 2190 members was followed by an agenda, which
was signed by 2432            members. The meeting was conducted on
11.07.2022 and a total of 2460 members were present in the meeting.
Thereafter, 2539 members, supporting the resolutions passed in the
General Council Meetings,          filed affidavits before the Election
Commission of India.
35. The Co-ordinator and Joint Co-ordinator could not act on the
requisition since there was a dead lock in the decision making in the
Party. According to the appellant, the posts of Co-ordinator and Joint
Co-ordinator had lapsed on 23.06.2022 for want of ratification. It is
pertinent to note that the elections of the other members of the General
Council shall not lapse since their elections were not based on any
amended Bye-Law. The present situation, is identical to the situation that
was prevailing in 2017. When the Co-ordinator and Joint Co-ordinator
were not in a position to call for the meeting, the members cannot be
forced to approach the Court every time, therefore, the power vested on
the office-bearers under Rule 20 A (vii) should be exercised for this
purpose as exercised for the meeting held on 12.09.2017.
36. For easy reference, the Bye-Laws of the Political Party is
annexed with this judgement.
37. The amendments to the Bye-Laws can happen only at the
General Council under Rule 43 of the Bye-Laws.
38. The General Council Meeting was convened on 11.07.2022
pursuant to the order passed by the learned Single Judge in O.A.Nos.368,
370 and 379 of 2022 and thereafter, by order dated 06.07.2022 the
Hon'ble Supreme Court in S.L.P.(C) No.11237 of 2022 has observed as
“......b. So far as the Meeting of the General Council
of the respondent No. 3, slated to be held on 11.07.2022 is
concerned, the same may proceed in accordance with law
and in that relation, the other aspects of any interim relief
ought to be projected and presented before the learned
Single Judge dealing with civil suit(s) on the Original
39. The appellant-Co-Ordinator sent a letter dated 28.06.2022 to
the Election Commission of India stating that the posts of Co-Ordinator
and the Joint Co-Ordinator had lapsed for the reason that the election in
the Executive Council Meeting dated 01.12.2021 was not ratified in the
General Council Meeting held on 23.06.2022. From the said letter, it is
clear that the appellant-Joint Co-Ordinator has given up his right to
continue as Joint Co-Ordinator. Therefore, there is no Joint-Co-Ordinator
in the Party after the said letter.        The appellant cannot be compelled to
continue as Joint Co-Ordinator forever. When the appellant has given up
his right to continue as Joint -Co-Ordinator, the appellant and the 1st
respondent in O.S.A.No.227 of 2022 cannot jointly conduct the General
Council Meeting. The           common sense approach was followed on
12.09.2017, wherein the General Council Meeting was announced at the
instance of the Office Bearers Party Headquarters. The strict compliance
of Rule 19(vii) would lead to absurdity. In these circumstances, the
General Council Meeting called for by the Presidum Chairman on
23.06.2022 to convene the Special General Council Meeting on
11.07.2022 is proper.
40. The requisition for the meeting was made by 2190 members
out of the 2665 members of the General Council. This amounts to more
than 80% of the General Council members. The requisition was to be
made by the members for deciding the issue of the Single Leadership.
The requisition was readout to all the members who were present and
with their approval, it was handed over to the Chairman of the meeting on
the stage in front of the requisitioners.      The requisition was followed
with an Agenda being signed and requested by 2432 General Council
Members. Thereafter, the meeting on 11.07.2022 was attended by 2460
members and 2539 members have filed affidavits before the Election
Commission of India affirming their support to the resolutions passed at
the General Council Meeting on 11.07.2022.
41. The learned Single Judge, while disposing of the Original
Applications observed that since there is interpolation, it can only be a
manufactured document. It is pertinent to note that none of the members,
who signed the requisition or the agenda or attended the meeting, have
come before this Court claiming that they did not do so. That apart, the
1st respondent-plaintiffs has not made out any assertion in the plaint that
there was no requisition that was placed at the meeting. Absolutely, there
is no averment in the pleadings that the requisition letter is a fabricated
document or not genuine. In the absence of any pleading or averment,
the contention of the 1st respondent(in O.S.A.No.227 of 2022) that the
requisition letter given by 2190 members is not genuine cannot be
accepted.        When none of the 2190 members, who have signed the
requisition letter to convene the Special General Council Meeting,
disputed their signature or contents of the document, a third party to the
said letter cannot question the same. The person who can dispute the
signature can only be that particular person and not a third party. In the
absence of any challenge made by the signatories to the requisition
letter, the said letter   cannot be held as fabricated or not genuine
document. Even assuming that the Resolutions passed on 23.06.2022
and on 11.07.2022 are found to be illegal or against the Bye-Laws of the
Parties, it is always open to 1/5th members of the General Council to
convene a Special General Council Meeting and reverse the resolution
passed in those two meetings. In the case on hand, no such meeting was
called for at the instance of 1/5th of the General Council members to
reverse the decision.   This would establish that no irreparable injury has
been caused to the 1st respondent (in O.S.A.No.227 of 2022).
42. The members of the General Council are representing the
Primary Members of the Party and when the majority of the members of
the General Council have given requisition for convening the Special
General Council Meeting on 11.07.2022           and also supported the
Resolutions on 23.06.2022 and 11.07.2022, the balance of convenience
cannot be held in favour of the 1st respondent. On the contrary, the
balance of convenience can only be in favour of the appellant.
43. With regard to the prima facie case is concerned, (2012) 6
SCC 792 (cited supra) the Hon'ble Supreme Court held that even where
prima facie case is in favour of the 1st respondent-plaintiff, the Court will
refuse temporary injunction if the injury suffered by the 1 st respondent on
account of refusal of temporary injunction was not irreparable. In the
judgement reported in (1992) 1 SCC 719 (cited supra) the Apex Court
held that while granting or refusing to grant interim injunction, the
Court should exercise sound judicial discretion to find the amount of
substantial mischief or injury which is likely to be caused to the parties, if
the injunction is refused and compare it with that which is likely to be
caused to the other side if the injunction is granted. If on weighing
competing possibilities or probabilities of likelihood of injury and if the
Court considers that pending the suit, the subject matter should be
maintained in status quo, an injunction would be issued. Thus the Court
has to exercise its sound judicial discretion in granting or refusing the
relief of interim injunction pending the suit.
44. By giving a direction that there shall be no Executive Council
Meeting or General Council Meeting without joint consent of the Co-
Ordinator and the Joint Co-Ordinator, a situation has arisen where the
party, as a whole, will undergo irreparable hardship, since there is no
possibility of the appellant and the 1st respondent(in O.S.ANo.227 of
2022) acting jointly to convene a meeting, much less a General Council
Meeting to discuss Single Leadership.       The direction only furthers the
“functional deadlock” that was already in existence in the Party.
45. As per Rule 20A(ix), the Co-Ordinator and Joint Co-ordinator
are empowered to take such actions as he may deem fit on important
political events, policies and programmes of urgent nature which cannot
brook delay and await the meeting of either Executive Committee or
General Council of the Party. Such decisions and actions have to be
ratified by the General Council in its next meeting. However, it is open to
the Co-Ordinator and Joint Co-ordinator to obtain the views of the
General Council Members on such urgent matters by post when the
Council is not in session. Therefore, even if the Co-Ordinator and Joint
Co-Ordinator take any decision/action, the same is to be ratified at the
46. When the applications have been filed challenging the
Special General Council Meeting held on 11.07.2022 and when the
learned Single Judge, by order dated 11.07.2022 permitted the convening
of the Special General Council Meeting         on 11.07.2022, which was
challenged before the Hon'ble Supreme Court, the Apex Court, by order
dated 29.07.2022, while remanding the matter back to the learned Single
Judge for fresh consideration, directed the parties to maintain status quo
as on the date of 29.07.2022. It is pertinent to note that the Apex Court
has not directed the parties to maintain status quo as on 11.07.2022 or on
23.06.2022.        Therefore, it is clear that the Resolutions passed on
23.06.2022 and 11.07.2022 were not disturbed till the pronouncement of
the order by the learned Single Judge in O.A.Nos.368, 370 and 379 of
2022 on 17.08.2022.
47. When the Presidium Chairman had announced the date of next
Special General Council Meeting based on the requisition made by 2190
members of the General Council on 23.06.2022 the 1st               respondent-
plaintiff      should have challenged the decision taken on 23.06.2022 to
convene a Special General Council Meeting on 11.07.2022. In the case
on hand, the 1st respondent has filed the suit challenging only the
Special General Council Meeting held on 11.07.2022.                When the 1 st
respondent did not challenge the Resolutions passed in the General
Council Meeting held on 23.06.2022, an order of status quo ante as on
23.06.2022 cannot be granted.
48. So far as the direction to the appellant and the 1st respondent
(in O.S.A.No.227 of 2022) to conduct the Executive Council Meeting or
General Council Meeting jointly is not workable, as the appellant and
the 1st respondent have not been able to act together and there has been a
deadlock, which has resulted in the impossibility to perform the
functions, which is the very premise based on which the General Council
of the Party was held on 12.09.2017, wherein the posts of Co-Ordinator
and the Joint Co-Ordinator were created and the appellant and the 1st
respondent came to be elected to the said posts.
49. Since the appellant-Joint Co-Ordinator, by his letter dated
28.06.2022 to the Election Commission of India, has stated that his post
along with the post of Co-Ordinator had lapsed, as already stated, he
cannot be compelled to continue in the said post. That apart, the 1st
respondent (in O.S.A.No.227 of 2022) alone cannot take any decision
independently. In these circumstances, we are not giving any finding
with regard to the stand taken by the appellant that the posts of Co-
Ordinator and Joint Co-Ordinator had lapsed for want of ratification on
23.06.2022. The said issue can be decided in the pending suit.
50. The ratio laid down in the Judgments relied upon by the
learned Senior Counsels appearing for the appellant squarely applies to
the facts and circumstances of the present case. The ratio laid down by
the Gauhati High Court          in an unreported judgement made in CRP
No.22(AP) of 2015            [cited supra] applies to the case of the 1 st
respondent.
51. Though there is no dispute with regard to the ratio laid down
by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the judgment reported in 1990 Supp
(1) SCC 727 (cited supra)         relied upon by the learned Senior Counsel
