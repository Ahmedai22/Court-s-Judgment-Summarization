1.    This appeal is directed against the judgment and award
dated 14th April, 2007 in Application (WCA) No.17/B-8/2004,
passed by the Commissioner for Workmen’s Compensation and
Judge, 8th Labour Court at Mumbai, whereby the application
preferred by the appellants – applicants for compensation on
account of death, of late Vishakha Singh Suman Singh (the
deceased), on account of accident arising out of and in the
course of his employment, while driving motor vehicle (truck)
bearing No.MH-04-F-8979, owned by opponent no.1 employer
and insured with opponent no.2 – insurer, on 3 rd November,
2003, came to be dismissed.
2.    The background facts leading to this appeal can be stated
(a)   Late Vishakha Singh, the husband of applicant no.1
- Smt. Harvinder Kaur, father of applicant no.2 - Master
Charanjit Singh and applicant no.3 - Kum Luv Prit Kaur and
son of applicant no.4 - Mr. Suman Singh and applicant no.5 -
Smt. Mahindra Kaur, was employed with opposite party no.1 -
Mr. Tarvinder Singh, as a driver on the truck No.MH-04-F-8979.
The said vehicle was insured with opposite party no.2.      The
applicants claim that the deceased was 35 years of age. He was
drawing wages of Rs.4,000/- per month.
(b)   While the deceased was driving the said truck
bearing No.MH-04-F-8979, on his way to Mumbai, in the course
of employment, the deceased died at Chandwad, district Nashik.
Inquest was held on the body of the deceased.       Postmortem
examination was conducted. It was opined that the deceased
died on account of coronary artery heart disease.           The
applicants asserted that the deceased died on account of the
stress and strain of employment as the deceased had been
driving the said vehicle continuously since 17 to 18 days. On
the day of the death, the deceased was on his way to Mumbai
from Ranchi, which is at a distance of 1800 kms. from Mumbai.
Thus, the applicants claimed compensation of Rs.3,94,120/-
along with interest and penalty.
(c)   The opposite party no.1 - employer filed the written
statement.   It was admitted that the deceased was employed
with opposite party no.1 as a driver on the above-numbered
vehicle and met death on 3rd November, 2003, at Chandwad,
Nashik, on his way to Mumbai, in the course of employment.
The opposite party no.1 further admitted that he was paying
wages of Rs.4,000/- per month and a claim form was submitted
to the insurer with the aforesaid particulars.
(d)   Opposite party no.2 - insurer resisted the claim
principally on the ground that the death, which the deceased
met, was natural. The death was not on account of the use of
the motor vehicle. Nor the accident occurred out of the
employment. The contingencies as specified in Section (II) of the
Contract of Insurance dated 29th September, 2003 and Section
147 of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988, were not made out, and
thus the applicants were not entitled to claim compensation. In
substance, there was no nexus between the death, which the
deceased met, and the use of the vehicle, which was insured
with opposite party no.2 – insurer.
(e)  In the backdrop of the aforesaid pleadings, the
learned Commissioner framed following issues at Exhibit-O-4:
1.   Whether the applicants prove that the deceased met
with fatal accident in the course of and arising out of
use of the vehicle with the opposite party and died?
2.   Whether the applicants prove that they are entitled to
receive the compensation claimed or such other
amount from the opposite parties Nos.1 and 2?
3.   Whether the applicants prove that they are entitled to
receive the compensation with penalty and interests?
(f)  The learned Commissioner recorded the evidence of
applicant no.1 Smt. Harvinder Kaur (witness no.1 – for the
applicants), Mr. Tarvinder Singh (witness no.1 for opposite
party) and Suryakant Kambli (witness no.1 for insurer). After
appraisal of the oral evidence and documents tendered for her
perusal, the learned Commissioner was persuaded to return the
finding that the employer – employee relationship between the
deceased and opposite party no.1 was established. However, the
applicants were non-suited on the ground that the death, being
natural, cannot be said to have been caused by an accident
arising out of and in the course of his employment. The learned
Commissioner while answering the issue nos.2 and 3, went on
to further record that the question as to whether the deceased
was in fact employed with the opposite party no.1 was in the
corridor of uncertainty as it was brought out in the cross-
examination of Tarvinder Singh - opposite party no.1 that he
was dealing in the business of transport under the name and
style of Amrit Roadlines, a partnership firm.    Thus, the mere
fact that on the date of the accident, the deceased was working
as a driver on the above-numbered vehicle, owned by opposite
party no.1, was not sufficient to award compensation, held the
3.    Being aggrieved by and dissatisfied with the aforesaid
judgment and award, the appellants – applicants are in appeal.
4.    I have heard Mr. Gatane, the learned Counsel for the
appellants and Mr. Dange, the learned Counsel for respondent
no.2 – insurer. With the assistance of the learned Counsel for
the parties, I have perused the material on record including the
impugned judgment and depositions of the witnesses and
documents     tendered    for  the   perusal    of   the   learned
5.    At the outset, Mr. Dange, the learned Counsel for
respondent no.2 – insurer, assailed the tenability of the appeal
as it does not involve any substantial question of law. In view of
the proviso to sub-section (1) of Section 30 of the Employees
Compensation Act, 1923, the existence of a substantial question
of law is a jurisdictional condition for entertaining the appeal,
urged Mr. Dange.      In the case at hand, while admitting the
appeal, no such substantial question of law was framed by this
Court and, therefore, at this juncture, the appeal does not
deserve to be entertained.
6.    Mr. Gatatne, the learned Counsel for the appellants, joined
the issue by canvassing a submission that the very fact that the
learned Commissioner initially recorded a finding that the
employer – employee relationship between the deceased and
opposite party no.1 was established and, later on, went on to
take a diametrically opposite view itself raises a substantial
question of law.    Taking the Court through the observations
made by the learned Commissioner on the aspect of employer –
employee relationship, which are irreconcilable, in the least, Mr.
Gatane would urge that the fact that a substantial question of
law was not framed while admitting the appeal cannot be urged
to deprive the appellants of the opportunity to assail the legality,
propriety and correctness of the impugned judgment and award,
lest the appellants would suffer an irretrievable prejudice.
7.    I am persuaded to agree with the submission of Mr.
Gatane. Indeed, while admitting the appeal, on 3 rd July, 2007,
this Court did not frame any substantial question of law or gave
an indication as to the question of law on which the appeal
deserved admission. However, that does not preclude the Court
from considering the submissions to ascertain as to whether
there   is a substantial question of law, which warrants
determination in this appeal, even at this stage. It is trite that a
substantial question of law can be reformulated.              Thus,
respondent no.2 cannot draw any mileage from the said fact of
admission of the appeal without framing a substantial question
of law.
8.    The submission on behalf of the appellants that the
learned Commissioner committed a patent error in first holding
that, in view of the pleadings and material on record, the
employee – employer relationship between the respondent no.1
and deceased was established, and later on, dismissing the
claim on the ground that the said fact was not adequately
proved, appears well founded. Indisputably, in the written
statement, respondent no.1 has admitted the employer –
employee     relationship  and   also  the  essential  terms   of
employment.        In paragraph 6, the learned Commissioner
recorded a categorical finding that such employer – employee
relationship was established.     Nonetheless, while considering
the entitlement of the applicants for compensation, the learned
Commissioner recorded a view that the said fact was not proved.
This somersault gives rise to a substantial question of law as to
whether the learned Commissioner, once having recorded an
affirmative finding on the employer – employee relationship, was
justified in dismissing the application for compensation on the
count that no such relationship was established.      I am thus
persuaded to entertain the appeal.
9.     Mr. Gatane, the learned Counsel for the appellants, would
urge that apart from the aforesaid inconsistent findings as
regards the proof of employer – employee relationship, the
learned Commissioner committed a manifest error in returning
a finding that the deceased did not meet death in the
course      of and out of the employment.           The learned
Commissioner, according to Mr. Gatane, was in error in not
appreciating the evidence on record, which establishes that the
deceased was on the wheel of the truck for 17 to 18 days and
driving for such a prolonged period was impregnated with the
stress and strain, which eventually led to cardiac problem.
Therefore, it must have been held by the learned Commissioner
that the stress and strain of driving for such a long period,
accelerated the death of the deceased, submitted Mr. Gatane.
10.   In opposition to this, Mr. Dange, the learned Counsel for
respondent no.2 – insurer supported the impugned judgment.
It was urged that the death, which the deceased met, was
undoubtedly natural. There was next to no evidence, according
to Mr. Dange, to show that the deceased suffered any stress and
strain of the driving.  In fact, there was no explanation as to
why the cleaner on the said vehicle was not examined.       The
cleaner was the best person to throw light on the circumstances
of transaction leading to the death of the deceased.     In the
circumstances, the learned Commissioner, according to Mr.
Dange, committed no error in dismissing the application.
11.   To lend support to the aforesaid submission, Mr. Dange,
placed reliance on the judgment of the Supreme Court in the
case of Shakuntala Chandrakant Shreshti vs. Prabhakar Maruti
Garvali and another,1 which was referred to and heavily relied
upon by the learned Commissioner in support of the said
12.   Per contra, Mr. Gatane, the learned Counsel for the
appellants, submitted that the learned Commissioner totally
misconstrued the ratio in the case of Shakuntala Chandrakant
Shreshti (supra) and completely lost sight of the fact that in the
said case compensation was claimed in respect of death of the
cleaner, who was not expected to be under the stress and strain,
which     a   driver  had   to   encounter.   In   contrast,   the
pronouncement in the case of Param Pal Singh through Father
vs. National Insurance Company and another,2 according to Mr.
Gatane, governs the facts of the case at hand with full force.
13.   It is imperative to note that there is no dispute over the
fact that the deceased died on 3 rd November, 2003, while he was
on his way back to Mumbai along with the motor vehicle bearing
No.MH-04-F-8979.      Undoubtedly, the autopsy surgeon opined
that the cause of death was coronary artery heart disease and it
was natural.      In Column nos.19 and 20 of the postmortem
report, the autopsy surgeon made following observations:
coverings, size, weight and general Brain matter – Edematous
condition of the organ itself and any
(g) Heart with weight                  Heart enlarged. Aorta showed
(h) Large vessels                      atheromatous plaque coronarie
(i) Additional remarks                 thickened & calcified coronary ostia
narrowed.
14.     Laying emphasis on the aforesaid observations in the
postmortem report and the contents of the inquest, wherein the
public witnesses opined that the deceased might have met
death, while he was in the cabin of the truck, Mr. Gatane would
urge that the mere fact that the deceased met a natural death is
not decisive.      The question as to whether the death, which the
deceased met, was on account of accident arising out of and in
the cause of employment cannot be determined de hors the
attendant circumstances. The learned Commissioner, according
to Mr. Gatane, misdirected herself in taking a hyper-technical
view of the matter and lost sight of the beneficial object of the
15.     The learned Commissioner was persuaded to negative the
claim of the applicants for the reason that both Ms. Harvinder
Kaur - applicant no.1 and Mr. Tarvinder Singh – opposite party
no.1 conceded in the cross-examination that they were unaware
as to whether at the time of his death, the deceased was driving
the vehicle or it was in a stationary state. Secondly, the non-
examination    of  the   cleaner,  according   to    the  learned
Commissioner, was inexplicable.     It was only the cleaner, who
could have thrown light on the circumstances in which the
deceased met death.
16.   Indeed, the cleaner could have thrown light over the
situation, and transactions leading to the death of the deceased.
However, the omission to examine the cleaner could not have
been exalted to such a pedestal as to jettison away the
applicants claim overboard.    At the most, it would imply that
the applicants have not led evidence to sustain a finding that
the deceased died while he was on the wheel of the motor
vehicle.   Nonetheless, the uncontroverted facts indicated that
the deceased had left Mumbai for Ranchi and, on the day of
death, the deceased was on his way back to Mumbai from
Ranchi, and 17 to 18 days period had lapsed since the deceased
had left Mumbai. This factor was not properly appreciated by
the learned Commissioner. Instead, the learned Commissioner
proceeded to draw support from the judgment of the Supreme
Court in the case of Shakuntala Shreshti (supra).
17.   In the case of Shakuntala Shreshti (supra), Prakash, the
deceased therein, was working as a cleaner in the vehicle. He
suddenly developed chest pain. Upon being admitted to
Government        Hospital,    Mangaon,       he   was    declared   dead.
Evidently, the deceased died due to heart attack. The Supreme
Court noted that, Mr. Parasharam, the driver of the said vehicle,
who was the brother of the deceased, was not examined to
throw light upon the circumstances under which the death took
place. The Supreme Court thus held that the proximate nexus
between     the    cause    of   death    and     employment     was   not
18.   In paragraph 26 in the case of Shakuntala Shreshti
(supra), the Supreme Court expounded factors which are
required to be established in a case of the present nature.            The
observations in paragraphs 26 to 29 are instructive and hence
“26. In a case of this nature to prove that accident has
taken place, factors which would have to be established, inter
(1) stress and strain arising during the course of
(2) nature of employment,
(3) injury aggravated due to stress and strain.
27.    The deceased was traveling in a vehicle. The same by
itself can not give rise to an inference that the job was
strenuous.
28.    Only because a person dies of heart attack, the same
does not give rise to automatic presumption that the same
was by way of accident. A person may be suffering from a
heart disease although he may not be aware of the same.
Medical opinion will be of relevance providing guidance to
court in this behalf.
29.    Circumstances must exist to establish that death was
caused by reason of failure of heart was because of stress
and strain of work. Stress and strain resulting in a sudden
heart failure in a case of the present nature would not be
presumed. No legal fiction therefor can be raised. As a person
suffering from a heart disease may not be aware thereof,
medical opinion therefore would be of relevance. Each case,
therefore, has to be considered on its own fact and no hard
and fast rule can be laid down therefor.”
19.  After analysing the facts in the said case, the Supreme
Court, inter alia, observed as under:
“36. Only because the cause of death was due to heart
attack, the same by itself may not be a ground to arrive at a
conclusion that an accident had occurred resulting in
injury.
37. The nature of duty of the deceased was that of a
helper. Per se that the duties would not be such which could
cause stress or strain. If an additional duty were required to
be performed by him, the same was required to be clearly
stated.
38. Unless evidence is brought on record to elaborate that
the death by way of cardiac arrest has occurred because of
stress or strain, the Commissioner would not have
jurisdiction to grant damages. In other words, the claimant
was bound to prove jurisdictional fact before the
Commissioner. Unless such jurisdictional facts are found,
the Commissioner will have no jurisdiction to pass an order.
It is now well-settled that for arriving at a finding of a
jurisdictional fact, reference to any precedent would not be
helpful as a little deviation from the fact of a decided case or
an additional fact may make a lot of difference by arriving at
a correct conclusion. For the said purpose, the statutory
authority is required to pose unto himself the right
question.”
20.   Banking     upon   the  aforesaid  observations    especially,
“unless evidence is brought on record to elaborate that the
death by way of cardiac arrest has occurred because of stress or
strain, the Commissioner would not have jurisdiction to grant
damages”, the learned Commissioner held that, in the absence
of evidence of cleaner, in the case at hand, it cannot be said that
the deceased died on account of stress and strain caused by the
21.   I am afraid to subscribe to the view of the learned
Commissioner. If the aforesaid pronouncement is construed
properly, in the backdrop of the fact situation therein, the
crucial distinguishing factor appears to be the nature of the
employment of the deceased. In the said case, the deceased was
stated to be working as a cleaner.       The nature of the said
employment, which was essentially of a helper to the driver, was
held to be not per se such onerous as to cause stress or strain.
This distinguishing feature, in my considered view, was lost
sight of by the learned Commissioner.
22.   The pronouncement of Supreme Court in the case of
Param Pal Singh (supra) arose out of a case, where the deceased
was working as a driver and suffered death while on the wheel
of the truck. In the facts of the said case, the deceased therein
felt uncomfortable and, therefore, parked the vehicle on the
roadside of a nearby hotel.             Immediately after parking the
vehicle he fainted and the nearby persons took him to the
hospital, where the deceased was declared brought dead.
23.   After adverting to the previous pronouncements of the
Supreme Court, including in the case of Shakuntala Shreshti
(supra), Malikarjuna G. Hiremath vs. Oriental Insurance Co.
Ltd.3, Mackinnon Mackenzie & Co. (P) Ltd. vs. Ibrahim
Mahmmed Issak4, the Supreme Court held that there was
causal connection to the death of the deceased with that of his
employement as a truck driver.
24.   The observations in paragraphs 29 and 30 delineate the
approach      to   be   adopted      while    ascertaining      the    causal
connection. They read as under:
“29. Applying the various principles laid down in the above
decisions to the facts of this case, we can validly conclude
that there was CAUSAL CONNECTION to the death of the
deceased with that of his employment as a truck driver. We
cannot lose sight of the fact that a 45 years old driver meets
with his unexpected death, may be due to heart failure
while driving the vehicle from Delhi to a distant place called
Nimiaghat near Jharkhand which is about 1152 kms. away
from Delhi, would have definitely undergone grave strain
and stress due to such long distance driving. The deceased
being a professional heavy vehicle driver when undertakes
the job of such driving as his regular avocation it can be
safely held that such constant driving of heavy vehicle,
being dependant solely upon his physical and mental
resources & endurance, there was every reason to assume
that the vocation of driving was a material contributory
factor if not the sole cause that accelerated his unexpected
death to occur which in all fairness should be held to be an
untoward mishap in his life span. Such an ‘untoward
mishap’ can therefore be reasonably described as an
‘accident’ as having been caused solely attributable to the
nature of employment indulged in with his employer which
was in the course of such employer’s trade or business.
30. Having regard to the evidence placed on record there
was no scope to hold that the deceased was simply
travelling in the vehicle and that there was no obligation for
him to undertake the work of driving. On the other hand,
the evidence as stood established proved the fact that the
deceased was actually driving the truck and that in the
course of such driving activity as he felt uncomfortable he
safely parked the vehicle on the side of the road near a hotel
soon whereafter he breathed his last. In such
circumstances, we are convinced that the conclusion of the
Commissioner of Workmen’s Compensation that the death
of the deceased was in an accident arising out of and in the
course of his employment with the second respondent was
perfectly justified and the conclusion to the contrary
reached by the learned Judge of the High Court in the order
impugned in this appeal deserves to be set aside.
(emphasis supplied)
25.   A useful reference can also made to the judgment in the
case of Subhadrabai w/o Ganpatrao Suryawanshi (died) per LRs
Aruna d/o Ganpatrao Suryawanshi vs. Maharashtra State Road
Transport Corporation and others5, wherein it was held that
death by heart attack is an accident is well recognized. It was
inter alia observed as under:
“21. Thus, death by heart attack is an accident is now well
established by series of judicial pronouncements made from
time-to-time. If the workman died of heart attack, there was
a pre-existing heart condition which was aggravated by the
strain of work of the deceased while performing his duties
which resulted in his death and as such there is a causal
connection between the injury and the accident which has
been construed in wider sense as a mishap external or
internal not expected or designed by the victim. The accident
in the instant case was 'failure of heart'. Considering the
evidence on record it is obvious that the accident was in the
course of the employment and, therefore, it can be said that
it arose during the course of the employment within the
meaning of Section 3(1) of the Act.”
26.   On the aforesaid touchstone, reverting to the facts of the
case, there is evidence to indicate that the vehicle in question
had left Mumbai for Ranchi 17 to 18 days prior to the date of the
death of the deceased.       On the day of occurrence, the deceased
was on his way back to Mumbai from Ranchi.                 The deceased
had started eight days prior to the day of occurrence from
Ranchi.    The distance to be covered was around 1800 kms.
There was no second or spare driver on the said truck.              These
circumstances deserve adequate consideration.
27.   An effort was made during the course of the cross-
examination of Mr. Tarvinder Singh – opposite party no.1 that
his drivers do not get exerted. They do not drive continuously
but take breaks.      The deceased was healthy.            There was no
complaint about his health. Tarvinder Singh, not unexpectedly,
asserted that the deceased do not die due to the work pressure.
28.   The aforesaid admissions, even if they can be called so,
and even construed at par, do not erode the enormity of the
situation, which a driver faces, on account of long and arduous
journey, for almost 18 days, uninterrupted.           The long distance
driving for about 3600 kms. can be expected to generate stress
and strain, even subconsciously.   I am, therefore, persuaded to
hold that in the facts of the instant case, the death of the
deceased can be said to have been accelerated on account of the
stress and strain associated with the long distance driving for
almost 18 days in trying circumstances. Any other view of the
matter would defeat the beneficial object of the provisions
contained    in Section   3 of the    Employees Compensation
29.   On the aspect of the employer – employee relationship, as
observed     above,   the   learned    Commissioner      recorded
inconsistent findings.  Whether such approach of the learned
Commissioner is justifiable?    To start with, it is imperative to
note that in the written statement by opposite party no.1, the
relationship between the opposite party no.1 and deceased was
admitted in no uncertain terms.     Even the essential terms of
employment were indicated therein.       To add to this, in the
written statement filed on behalf of opposite party no.2 –
insurer, the absence of employer – employee relationship
between opposite party no.1 and the deceased was not
specifically pleaded.
30.   The aforesaid factor assumes importance for the reason
that opposite party no.2 – insurer sought to draw support from
a report of the Suryakant Kambli, (witness no.1 for opposite
party no.2) an insurance investigator that the opposite party
no.1 gave a certificate to the effect that the deceased was
employed with Amrit Roadlines and was paid salary of
Rs.2,000/- per month. No effort appears to have been made by
opposite party no.2 to either controvert the assertion of opposite
party no.1 that the deceased was his employee or to contend
that the deceased was the employee of Amrit Roadlines, on the
basis of the said report of the insurance investigator. In the
absence of such pleadings, the applicants were not equipped to
meet a challenge to the employer – employee relationship, when
the said fact was, on the one hand, unequivocally admitted by
opposite party no.1 and, on the other hand, not specifically
denied by opposite party no.2 – insurer.
31.   Emphasis was laid on behalf of respondent no.2 on the
manner    in  which   Tarvinder   Singh    fared  in  the   cross-
examination. Opposite party no.1 - Tarvinder Singh conceded in
the cross-examination that he deals in the transport business
under the name and style of Amrit Roadlines, which is a
partnership firm. There were 20 drivers and 20 cleaners apart
from two office staff and two loaders. All the vehicles were run
in the name of Amrit Roadlines, a partnerhsip firm.          Mr.
Tarvinder Singh, however, asserted that the vehicle in question
was in his personal name and it did not belong to Amrit
Roadlines and the deceased was not concerned with Amrit
32.   The  aforesaid   evidence  does   not  lead  to  the  only
conclusion that the vehicle in question belonged to Amrit
Roadlines.   Tarvinder Singh – opposite party no.2 might have
been a partner of Amrit Roadlines.       However, indisputably,
opposite party no.1 was the registered owner of the said vehicle
and the contract of insurance was between opposite party no.1
and the insurer. The fact that opposite party no.1 was a partner
in Amrit Roadlines, thus, does not detract materially from the
existence of employer – employee relationship between opposite
party no.1 and the deceased.
33.   In the aforesaid view of the matter, the fact that the
insurance investigator Mr. Suryakant Kambli (witness no.1 for
opposite party no.2), had obtained a certificate from opposite
party no.1 that the deceased was working with his organization
(Amrit Roadlines) since last two years and was driving tankers
and was earning Rs.2,000/-      per month, as salary, could not
have been so construed as to conclusively establish that the
deceased was not working with opposite party no.1.       It is more
so for the reason that the identity of the registered owner of the
vehicle in question, the fact that the deceased was driving the
said vehicle at the time of the occurrence and it was insured
with opposite party no.2, were not in contest. In the absence of
a specific defence having been set up in the written statement,
in my considered view, a document of aforesaid nature, which
might have been obtained by insurance investigator in an
unguarded moment, cannot command primacy to the prejudice
of the dependents of the deceased employee.
34.   For the same reasons, I am persuaded to believe the
testimony of opposite party no.1 that the deceased was paid
wages of Rs.4,000/- per month, which finds support in the
report of accident to workman. The learned Commissioner was,
however, justified in holding that the age of the deceased was 54
years as was evident from the driving license and applying the
factor of 139.13 relevant to the said age.      The compensation
would thus be (2000X139.13) Rs.2,78,260/-.
35.   For the foregoing reasons, the appeal deserves to be
allowed. Hence, the following order:
(i)   The appeal stands allowed with costs.
(ii) Opposite party nos.1 and 2 do jointly and severally
deposit the compensation of Rs.2,78,260/- along
with interest at the rate of 12% p.a. from 3 rd
December, 2003 till realization.
(iii) Upon realization, the amount of compensation be
disbursed to the appellants – applicants, in equal
proportion.
(iv) Opposite party no.1 shall also pay a sum of
Rs.25,000/- by way of penalty.
