In Re: An application under Section 439(2) of the
Code of Criminal Procedure arising out of Kasba
Police Station Case No.254/21 dated 20.08.2021
under Sections 341/354B/506/114 of the Indian
In the matter of: Mousumi Narayan (Nee Pal)
The State of West Bengal & Ors.
â€¦for the opposite party Nos. 2 and 3
On the allegation that the petitioner was harassed,
threatened with dire consequences and molested by the
opposite party Nos. 2 and 3, Kasba Police Station Case
No.254 of 2021 was registered on 20 th August, 2021
against the private opposite parties under Sections
341/354B/506/114 of the Indian Penal Code. The
accused persons/private opposite parties were granted
interim bail and subsequently confirmed bail by the
jurisdictional Magistrate holding, inter alia, that the
opposite parties have complied with Section 41A of the
Code of Criminal Procedure.
Even thereafter the accused persons committed the
same offence which compelled the petitioner to lodge
another complaint at Anandapur Police Station. Police
registered Anandapur Police Station Case No. 63 dated
5th April, 2022 against the private opposite parties. The
learned ACJM granted bail to both the private opposite
parties vide order dated 3rd November, 2021 when they
surrendered before the said Court. Now, the petitioner
has come up with an application for cancellation of bail
alleging the post bail conduct by the opposite parties.
Today the learned advocate for the petitioner has
filed a supplementary affidavit stating, inter alia, that
not only the opposite parties are threatening the
petitioner to withdraw the case but also the learned
advocate for the petitioner in this Court was threatened
by one Goutam Ghatak, inspector of Missing Person
Bureau, Barasat Police District. A complaint was made
by the learned advocate for the petitioner to various
authorities of the police department including the Chief
Minister of the State of West Bengal.
On perusal of the materials on record and having
heard the learned advocates for the parties, it is prima
facie proved when Anandapur Police Station case
number was registered against the opposite parties that
their post bail conduct was not satisfactory. They have
not observed the conditions for bail. Therefore, I am
inclined to cancel the order of bail passed in favour of
the opposite parties. The police authority is directed to
arrest the opposite parties forthwith.
Since the learned advocate for the petitioner was
even threatened by the police inspector being the well
wisher of the opposite parties, this Court is of the view
that both Kasba Police Station Case No.254 of 2021 and
Anandapur Police Station Case No.63 dated 5th April,
2022 ought to be investigated by a competent officer of
C.I.D., West Bengal.     Therefore, the Officers-in-charge
of Kasba P.S. and Anandapur P.S. are directed to hand
over the case diary of the above mentioned case to the
Officer, CID for further investigation as appointed by the
Let a copy of this order be sent to the D.I.G., C.I.D.,
Government of West Bengal at Bhawani Bhawan,
Let a copy of this order be sent also to the Officers-
in-charge   of  Kasba    P.S.  and   Anandapur    P.S.  for
information and necessary action.
The instant criminal motion is, thus, disposed of on
