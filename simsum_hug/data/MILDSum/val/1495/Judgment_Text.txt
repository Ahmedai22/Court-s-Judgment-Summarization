Order on Restoration Application
1.     This is an application for recall of the order dated 11.11.2005,
whereby the writ petition was dismissed in default.
2.     The cause shown for non-appearance is sufficient. The order dated
11.11.2005 is recalled and writ petition is restored to its original number.
The application is, accordingly, allowed.
1.     The petitioner has claimed to be an adopted son of late Ram Achal
Singh through adoption deed dated 23.10.1990. Ram Achal Singh died in
harness on 31.01.1995. Learned counsel for petitioner submitted that
petitioner was given assurance for compassionate appointment, therefore, he
remained silent. However, on 17.08.1999 he submitted an application for
compassionate appointment. Meanwhile, a declaratory suit was also filed by
petitioner, which was allowed in his favour and he was declared adopted son
2.     Learned counsel for petitioner further submitted that application of
petitioner for compassionate appointment remained pending before
respondents and on 17.10.2001 Respondent-2 send a communication to
petitioner wherein the adoption deed was doubted. In these circumstances,
petitioner again moved an application on 12.11.2001. However, by means of
impugned order dated 15.09.2003 claim of petitioner was rejected on the
ground that adopted son was not included in the definition of ‘family’ under
Uttar Pradesh Recruitment of Dependants of Government Servants Dying in
Harness Rules, 1974 (hereinafter referred to as “Rules, 1974”) . This order is
under challenge in present writ petition.
3.     Learned counsel for petitioner submitted that cause of petitioner still
survives and adopted son is now included in the definition of family,
therefore, his claim may be considered and petitioner be appointed on
compassionate ground.
4.     Learned    Standing     Counsel      appearing   for   State-Respondents,
submitted that Ram Achal Singh died way back on 31.01.1995, i.e., 27 years
ago, therefore, even the petitioner has purported right of compassionate
appointment, it could not be considered at such belated stage.
5.     Heard learned counsel for parties and perused the material available
on record.
6.     Before considering the rival submissions it would be apposite to
mention two recent judgments of Supreme Court on the issue of
compassionate appointment.
A.     Government of India and another vs. P. Venkatesh (2019) 15 SCC
10.   Bearing in mind the above principles, this Court held: (Umesh
Kumar Case, SCC pp. 141-42, para 6)
“6. For these very reasons, the compassionate employment cannot
be granted after a lapse of a reasonable period which must be
specified in the rules. The consideration for such employment is not
a vested right which can be exercised at any time in future. The
object being to enable the family to get over the financial crisis
which it faces at the time of the death of the sole breadwinner, the
compassionate employment cannot be claimed and offered
whatever the lapse of time and after the crisis is over.”
11.     The recourse to the Tribunal suffered from a delay of over a decade in
the first instance. This staleness of the claim took away the very basis of
providing companssionate appointment. The claim was liable to be rejected
on that ground and ought to have been so rejected. The judgment of the High
Court is unsustainable.” (Emphasis added)
B.     Central Coalfields Limited through its Chairman and Managing Director
and others vs. Parden Oraon, 2021 SCC OnLine SC 299:
8. The whole object of granting compassionate appointment is to enable the
family to tide over the sudden crisis which arises due to the death of the
sole breadwinner. The mere death of an employee in harness does not
entitle his family to such source of livelihood. The authority concerned has
to examine the financial condition of the family of the deceased, and it is
only if it is satisfied that but for the provision of employment, the family will
not be able to meet the crisis that the job is offered to the eligible member
of the family 1. It was further asseverated in the said judgment that
compassionate employment cannot be granted after a lapse of reasonable
period as the consideration of such employment is not a vested right
which can be exercised at any time in the future. It was further held that
the object of compassionate appointment is to enable the family to get
over the financial crisis that it faces at the time of the death of sole
breadwinner, compassionate appointment cannot be claimed or offered
after a significant lapse of time and after the crisis is over.”
7.     In the present case, it is not in dispute that Ram Achal Singh died in
the year 1995 and petitioner for the first time approached respondents on
17.08.1999, i.e., after more than four years. Thereafter petitioner remained
silent for some time and again approached respondents in the year 2001 and
ultimately claim of petitioner was rejected on the ground that adopted son is
not included in the definition of ‘family’.
8.          Definition of ‘family’ in Rules, 1974 was limited to relations, namely,
(i) wife or husband; (ii) sons; (iii) unmarried and widowed daughter.
Thereafter an amendment was carried out which was published in U.P.
Gazette dated 22.12.2011 wherein adopted son was also included. Therefore,
the impugned order dated 15.09.2003 cannot be faulted since at that time
adopted son was not included under the definition of ‘family’.
9.          There is another aspect which also goes against petitioner. As held in
P. Venkatesh (supra) and Parden Oraon (supra) the object of compassionate
appointment is to tide over the immediate financial crisis suffered by the
bereaved family due to unexpected death of employee concerned. The
substantial delay in the present case is now more than 27 years which goes
against the claim of petitioner. Therefore, the claim of petitioner was rightly
rejected by impugned order as well as considering the claim of petitioner for
compassionate appointment at belated stage, after 27 years of death of his
father, cannot be sustained. Compassionate appointment cannot be claimed
or offered after a significant lapse of time and after crisis is over.
10.         The writ petition lacks merit and is accordingly dismissed. Interim
order, if any, stands vacated.
