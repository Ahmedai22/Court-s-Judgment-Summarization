1.     By way of this petition under Section 11 of the Arbitration and
Conciliation Act, 1996 [hereinafter referred to as “the Act”], the
petitioner [hereinafter referred to as “Panasonic”] seeks appointment
of an arbitrator to adjudicate disputes which have arisen between the
parties under an Agreement dated 05.09.2016, entitled “Distribution
Agreement” [hereinafter referred to as “the Agreement”].
2.     By way of the Agreement, Panasonic was to sell electronic
goods to the respondent [hereinafter referred to as “Shah Aircon”],
which, according to Panasonic, is a proprietorship firm dealing in
electronic goods. The Agreement contains clauses1 with regard to
jurisdiction and dispute resolution in the following terms: -
This Agreement and all PO under this Agreement shall be
exclusively governed by and construed in accordance with
the laws of India, without regard to choice of law
principles. All issues relating to appointment of
arbitrator or any petition or application to be made to
the Court under the applicable arbitration law or any
Arbitration Award or any issue arising out of such
arbitration proceedings shall be subject to the exclusive
jurisdiction of Courts at New Delhi only.
The parties will attempt to settle any dispute, claim or
controversy arising out of this Agreement through
consultation and negotiation in good faith and in a spirit
of mutual co-operation. If those attempts fail, then either
Party can refer the disputes, issues or claims arising out
of or relating to this Agreement for arbitration by a sole
arbitrator who shall be appointed by the Managing
Director of the Panasonic. The arbitration proceedings
shall be held in New Delhi, conducted in English, and
shall be subject to the provisions of the Arbitration and
Conciliation Act 1996. The Arbitrator shall give a
reasoned award. In the event the Appoint Authority fails
to act or appoint a sole arbitrator, then either Party can
have the sole arbitrator appointed under the provisions
of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996. The use of
any ADR procedure will not be construed under the
doctrines of laches, waiver or estoppels to affect
adversely the rights of either party, and nothing in this
Section will prevent either party from resorting to judicial
proceedings if (1) good faith efforts to resolve the dispute
under these procedures have been unsuccessful, or (2)

documents].
interim relief from a court is necessary to prevent serious
and irreparable injury to one party or to others.”2
3.     Panasonic’s claims arise out of alleged unpaid invoices which
were raised by it for electronic goods sold to Shah Aircon. In the
course of correspondence between the parties, claims were raised by
both parties against each other. The correspondence commences with
a legal notice dated 20.08.2020, sent on behalf of Shah Aircon, in
which it claimed that it was appointed as an authorized distributor of
Panasonic for District Faridabad, Haryana. It was further alleged that
after the distributorship was given to Shah Aircon, Panasonic sold
goods to some dealers directly, and the bills were made in the name of
Shah Aircon. Shah Aircon claimed to have suffered losses to the tune
of approximately ₹29 lacs due to Panasonic, and also alleged that
Panasonic sold goods worth of approximately ₹20 lacs to third parties
in the name of Shah Aircon, but payment for the same was not
received by it.
4.     After further correspondences, including a legal notice dated
07.09.2020, sent on behalf of Shah Aircon, Panasonic addressed a
communication through counsel dated 05.10.2020 to Shah Aircon,
demanding a sum of ₹37,29,976/-, and invoked the arbitration clause
contained in the Agreement in the event Shah Aircon failed to pay the
amount mentioned therein. Shah Aircon replied to the said letter on
29.10.2020, stating inter alia that the demand notice was sent with an
intention to not pay the legal dues which Panasonic owed to Shah
Aircon, and to avoid reconciliation of accounts.
Emphasis supplied.
5.      As the parties were unable to resolve their disputes inter se,
Panasonic finally invoked the arbitration clause by a letter dated
29.01.2021. Shah Aircon responded by a letter dated 26.02.2021, inter
alia stating that it did not sign the Agreement with Panasonic. Shah
Aircon further averred that the disputes between the parties were only
in relation to rendition of accounts, for which it had approached the
court of competent jurisdiction in Gurugram, Haryana by filing a civil
suit, and that Panasonic had no power to appoint an arbitrator.
6.      As stated in this letter, Shah Aircon has filed a civil suit3, inter
alia seeking rendition of accounts and permanent injunction, which is
pending before the Court of learned Civil Judge (Junior Division),
Gurugram, Haryana [hereinafter referred to as “the Civil Court”].
Panasonic has made an application in the suit for reference to
arbitration under Section 8 of the Act.
7.      It is in these circumstances that Panasonic filed the present
petition under Section 11 of the Act on 15.07.2021.
8.      Notice in the present petition was issued on 16.07.2021, but it
appears from the order sheets that service could not be effected upon
Shah Aircon for some time, and that it entered appearance only on
01.09.2022. On 01.09.2022, Shah Aircon was granted an opportunity
to file its reply to the petition, which has been filed, and is on record.
9.      Although various defences have been taken by Shah Aircon in
the reply, both as to the reference to arbitration, and on the merits of
CS No. 797/2021, entitled Shah Aircon vs. Panasonic India Pvt Ltd. and Ors.
Panasonic’s claims, Mr. Zahid Hanief, learned counsel for Shah
Aircon, urged the following contentions before the Court:-
a. Mr. Hanief submitted that the purported arbitration clause in the
Agreement is not a valid arbitration clause as the reference of
disputes to arbitration is not mandatory. Mr. Hanief emphasised
that the clause uses the word “can”, as opposed to “shall”,
which, according to him, signifies an option in the hands of a
party as to whether to refer a dispute to arbitration or not. In
connection with this argument, he cited the judgment of the
Supreme Court in Jagdish Chander vs. Ramesh Chander and
Ors.4, and the judgment of the High Court of Calcutta in Jyoti
Brothers vs. Sree Durga Mining Company5.
b. Mr. Hanief submitted that Panasonic’s claims are barred by
limitation. He drew my attention to the heading “Term” in the
Agreement6 to show that the columns for the “Effective Date”
and “End Date” of the Agreement were not indicated. It is the
case of Shah Aircon that Panasonic enters into distribution
agreements of the sort involved in the present case for a period
of one year at a time, and under Clause II (ix) of the General
Terms & Conditions of the Agreement, read with Schedule II
and III thereof7, invoices were to be paid within a maximum
credit period of 14 days from the date of billing. Drawing on
these arguments, he submitted that the Agreement would have
Refer page No. 4 of the petitioner’s list of documents [See row No.5 column No. 1].
Refer page No. 22 of the petitioner’s list of documents [See heading “D” of Schedule III].
been valid at best until September, 2017, and the credit period
under the invoices would have been available to Shah Aircon
only for a period of 14 days thereafter. In such circumstances,
Mr. Hanief submitted that the commencement of arbitration
proceedings in terms of Section 21 of the Act by Panasonic’s
communication dated 29.01.2021, was outside the period of
limitation.
c. Mr. Hanief drew my attention to certain invoices raised by
Panasonic dated 30.08.2018 and 15.11.2018, which have been
placed on record with Shah Aircon’s list of documents. The said
invoices also contain jurisdiction and dispute resolution clauses,
which are in the following terms:-
“Terms & Conditions: 1. Subject to exclusive
jurisdiction of courts at Delhi only.
2. Interest @ 18%P.A. shall be charged if payment is
not received within Stipulated period.
3. Dispute Resolution: Any dispute, controversy or
claim arising out of or related to this invoice shall be
referred for adjudication to Sole Arbitrator to be
appointed by Managing Director/President of
Panasonic or any person nominated by him. The
arbitration shall be governed by the Indian
Arbitration & Conciliation Act, 1996 and shall be
conducted at Gurgaon in English language.”
Mr. Hanief’s contention based on this document was that this
Court lacks jurisdiction to entertain this petition which ought to
have been filed before the appropriate Court having jurisdiction
over the designated venue of the arbitration i.e. Gurugram,
10.    Mr. Kunal Kher, learned counsel for Panasonic, on the other
hand, rebutted the aforesaid contentions with the following
a. With regard to the interpretation of the arbitration clause, Mr.
Kher submitted that the essential ingredients of a valid
arbitration agreement stipulated in Section 7 of the Act are
satisfied in the present case. He argued that, upon a combined
reading of Clauses XXIV and XXV of the Agreement, it is clear
that the parties intended a mandatory reference to arbitration,
and that such intention cannot be eclipsed by mere use of the
word “can”, as suggested by Mr. Hanief.
b. On the question of limitation, Mr. Kher disputed the
submissions of Mr. Hanief, and argued that this is not a case
where the claims are so obviously barred by limitation as to
render a reference to arbitration unnecessary. He submitted that
Shah Aircon’s contention on limitation may be referred for
adjudication by the arbitral tribunal.
c. On the question of jurisdiction, Mr. Kher drew my attention to
the exclusive jurisdiction clauses contained both, in the
Agreement, and in the invoices, to which Mr. Hanief referred.
Both the clauses vest exclusive jurisdiction over disputes in the
Courts in Delhi. Additionally, the arbitration clause in the
Agreement also designates Delhi as the venue of arbitration.
Although the arbitration clause in the invoices designates
Gurugram as the venue of arbitration, Mr. Kher submitted that
the reference sought in the present case is under the Agreement,
and not under the invoices. In any event, he cited the judgments
of two co-ordinate benches of this Court in Cravants Media Pvt.
Ltd vs. Jharkhand State Co-Operative Milk Producers
Federation Ltd. and Anr.8, and Stella Indusstries Ltd. vs. Vero
Moda Retails Pvt. Ltd.9 to argue that an exclusive jurisdiction
clause contained in a contract having an arbitration clause
would prevail over designation of a particular venue, which is
intended only to signify the place for the conduct of the arbitral
proceedings.
11.     In the context of the above submissions, the first question to be
addressed concerns the jurisdiction of this Court. I am of the view that
Mr. Hanief’s submission on this account is unmerited. The disputes of
which Panasonic seeks reference to arbitration are under the
Agreement. The Agreement provides for exclusive jurisdiction of the
Courts in New Delhi, and specifically for the parties to have recourse
to this Court, for appointment of an arbitrator. As against this, the
arbitration clause in the invoices, to which Mr. Hanief refers, only
provides for the venue of the arbitration i.e., Gurgaon, and the
language in which arbitration should be conducted i.e., English. Even
in the invoices, exclusive jurisdiction is vested in courts in Delhi.
Even if it is assumed that the venue of the arbitration is as provided in
Judgement dated 06.12.2021 in ARB.P. 915/2021.
Judgment dated 25.05.2022 in ARB.P. 504/2020.
the invoices, Clause XXIV of the Agreement confers jurisdiction upon
the Courts in New Delhi.
12.      This Court, inter alia in Cravants Media Private Limited10, and
in Stella Indusstries Ltd11, has held that a provision conferring
jurisdiction for appointment of the arbitrator upon this Court would
prevail over a designation of the venue of the arbitration in a different
Court. In the present case, Clause XXIV of the Agreement is
unambiguous. I, therefore, hold that this Court has the jurisdiction to
entertain the present petition.
(II)      Interpretation of Clauses XXIV and XXV:
13.      The next question concerns interpretation of the arbitration
clause in the Agreement, particularly as to whether it constitutes a
binding agreement to refer disputes to arbitration. Mr. Hanief’s
submission to the contrary rests upon the use of the word “can” in
Clause XXV of the Agreement, and the last part of the said clause
which provides for recourse to civil proceedings in certain
circumstances.
14.      The requirements for existence of a valid arbitration clause are
encapsulated in Section 7 of the Act, which inter alia states that the
parties must contemplate a mandatory reference to arbitration. The
conditions for a valid arbitration agreement, as laid down in Section 7
of the Act, are also laid down in the judgments of the Supreme Court
inter alia in K.K Modi vs. K.N Modi and Ors.12, Bihar State Mineral
(1998) 3 SCC 573, refer paragraph 17(5).
Development Corporation and Anr. vs. Encon Builders (I)(P) Ltd.13,
and Babanrao Rajaram Pund vs. Samarth Builders and Developers
and Anr14.
15.      The interpretation of an arbitration clause, as indeed of all
contractual provisions, must be predicated upon a construction of the
contract as a whole, and no particular word or phrase should be unduly
emphasised to negate the clause of its true meaning. The use of the
word “can”, which normally signifies an option, as opposed to the
word “shall”, which is mandatory in nature, is not determinative of the
present case. This is because the word “can” is juxtaposed with the
words “either party”, signifying the option of either Panasonic, or
Shah Aircon, to refer disputes to arbitration. If either of the parties can
exercise such an option by referring the disputes under the Agreement
to arbitration, it is for all practical purposes, binding upon the other
party as well. The remainder of the clause, insofar as it refers to the
venue of arbitration, the language of arbitration, the applicability of
the Act, the requirement to give reasons, and the procedure for
appointment of an arbitrator by reference to Court, also supports the
view that the parties intended a mandatory reference to arbitration, and
incorporated the ancillary provisions into the Agreement for this
purpose only. Clause XXIV of the Agreement strengthens this
position, inasmuch as it confers exclusive jurisdiction on this Court in
case of a dispute, with special reference to arbitration proceedings, and
the appointment of an arbitrator.
2022 SCC OnLine SC 1165 [Judgment in Civil Appeal arising out of S.L.P.(Civil) 15989/2021,
decided on 07.09.2022], refer paragraph 23.
15:04:08               ARB.P.621/2021                                                                  Page 10 of 17
16.      The final part of Clause XXV of the Agreement also does not
persuade me to a contrary conclusion. The clause permits recourse to
judicial proceedings, if “(1) good faith efforts to resolve the dispute
under these procedures have been unsuccessful or (2) interim relief
from a court is necessary to prevent serious and irreparable injury to
one party or to others”15. In the first situation, this obviously does not
intend to derogate from the arbitration clause, but provides for a
situation where arbitration has been rendered impossible despite good
faith efforts of the parties. The second possibility deals with urgent
interim reliefs which, in any event, are contemplated under Section 9
of the Act.
17.      The two judgments which were cited by Mr. Hanief in support
of this proposition are, in my view, inapplicable to the facts and
circumstances of the present case.
18.      After referring to its earlier judgments, the Supreme Court in
Jagdish Chander16, held as follows: -
“8. This Court had occasion to refer to the attributes or
essential elements of an arbitration agreement in K.K.
Modi v. K.N. Modi [(1998) 3 SCC 573], Bharat Bhushan
Bansal v. U.P. Small Industries Corpn. Ltd. [(1999) 2 SCC
166] and Bihar State Mineral Development Corpn. v.
Encon Builders (I) (P) Ltd. [(2003) 7 SCC 418] In State of
Orissa v. Damodar Das [(1996) 2 SCC 216] this Court
held that a clause in a contract can be construed as an
“arbitration agreement” only if an agreement to refer
disputes or differences to arbitration is expressly or
impliedly spelt out from the clause. We may at this

15:04:08               ARB.P.621/2021                                                  Page 11 of 17
juncture set out the well-settled principles in regard to
what constitutes an arbitration agreement:
(i) The intention of the parties to enter into an arbitration
agreement shall have to be gathered from the terms of the
agreement. If the terms of the agreement clearly indicate
an intention on the part of the parties to the agreement to
refer their disputes to a private tribunal for adjudication
and a willingness to be bound by the decision of such
tribunal on such disputes, it is arbitration agreement.
While there is no specific form of an arbitration
agreement, the words used should disclose a
determination and obligation to go to arbitration and not
merely contemplate the possibility of going for
arbitration. Where there is merely a possibility of the
parties agreeing to arbitration in future, as contrasted
from an obligation to refer disputes to arbitration, there is
no valid and binding arbitration agreement.
(ii) Even if the words “arbitration” and “Arbitral Tribunal
(or arbitrator)” are not used with reference to the process
of settlement or with reference to the private tribunal
which has to adjudicate upon the disputes, in a clause
relating to settlement of disputes, it does not detract from
the clause being an arbitration agreement if it has the
attributes or elements of an arbitration agreement. They
are: (a) The agreement should be in writing. (b) The
parties should have agreed to refer any disputes (present
or future) between them to the decision of a private
tribunal. (c) The private tribunal should be empowered to
adjudicate upon the disputes in an impartial manner,
giving due opportunity to the parties to put forth their case
before it. (d) The parties should have agreed that the
decision of the private tribunal in respect of the disputes
will be binding on them.
(iii) Where the clause provides that in the event of disputes
arising between the parties, the disputes shall be referred
15:04:08               ARB.P.621/2021                                                 Page 12 of 17
to arbitration, it is an arbitration agreement. Where there
is a specific and direct expression of intent to have the
disputes settled by arbitration, it is not necessary to set out
the attributes of an arbitration agreement to make it an
arbitration agreement. But where the clause relating to
settlement of disputes, contains words which specifically
exclude any of the attributes of an arbitration agreement
or contains anything that detracts from an arbitration
agreement, it will not be an arbitration agreement. For
example, where an agreement requires or permits an
authority to decide a claim or dispute without hearing, or
requires the authority to act in the interests of only one of
the parties, or provides that the decision of the authority
will not be final and binding on the parties, or that if either
party is not satisfied with the decision of the authority, he
may file a civil suit seeking relief, it cannot be termed as
an arbitration agreement.
(iv) But mere use of the word “arbitration” or
“arbitrator” in a clause will not make it an arbitration
agreement, if it requires or contemplates a further or
fresh consent of the parties for reference to arbitration.
For example, use of words such as “parties can, if they so
desire, refer their disputes to arbitration” or “in the event
of any dispute, the parties may also agree to refer the same
to arbitration” or “if any disputes arise between the
parties, they should consider settlement by arbitration” in
a clause relating to settlement of disputes, indicate that the
clause is not intended to be an arbitration agreement.
Similarly, a clause which states that “if the parties so
decide, the disputes shall be referred to arbitration” or
“any disputes between parties, if they so agree, shall be
referred to arbitration” is not an arbitration agreement.
Such clauses merely indicate a desire or hope to have the
disputes settled by arbitration, or a tentative arrangement
to explore arbitration as a mode of settlement if and when
a dispute arises. Such clauses require the parties to arrive
at a further agreement to go to arbitration, as and when
15:04:08               ARB.P.621/2021                                                   Page 13 of 17
the disputes arise. Any agreement or clause in an
agreement requiring or contemplating a further consent or
consensus before a reference to arbitration, is not an
arbitration agreement, but an agreement to enter into an
arbitration agreement in future.”17
19.      The arbitration clause in Jagdish Chander18 provided that the
disputes “shall be mutually decided by the parties or shall be referred
to arbitration if the parties so determine”19. It is on the interpretation
of the phrase “if the parties so determine” that the Court came to the
conclusion that the arbitration agreement lacked consensus ad idem to
refer the parties to arbitration, and required fresh agreement for this
purpose. In the present case, in contrast, for the reasons stated
hereinabove, I have come to the conclusion that no fresh consent for
arbitration        is    contemplated,   and the Agreement     adequately
demonstrates consensus between the parties.
20.      With respect to the judgment of the Calcutta High Court in Jyoti
Brothers20, Mr. Hanief particularly emphasised the fact that the
arbitration clause in that case also used the word “can”, which the
Court held indicates a mere possibility significant of a pious wish, or
desire, but not an obligatory contract. The Court, therefore, held that
the arbitration agreement in that case was not a present agreement, or
a concluded agreement, to submit present or future disputes to
arbitration.
Refer paragraph 9 of Jagdish Chander.
15:04:08               ARB.P.621/2021                                                  Page 14 of 17
21.       The arbitration clause under consideration in Jyoti Brothers21
was in the following terms:-
“In the event of any dispute arising out of this contract the
same can be settled by Arbitration held by a Chamber of
Commerce at Madras. Their decision shall be binding to
the buyers and the sellers.”22
22.       The Calcutta High Court distinguished the view of the Court of
Appeal in Kedarnath Atmaram vs. Kesoram Cotton Mills23, inter alia
on the ground that the arbitration clause in Jyoti Brothers24 does not
express on whose option it was to call for arbitration. We are not faced
with that difficulty in this case where the clause clearly holds that
either of the parties can call for arbitration.
23.       For the aforesaid reasons, I am of the view that, on a proper
interpretation of the arbitration clause in the present case, the parties,
in fact, arrived at a mandatory understanding that their disputes under
the Agreement would be referred to arbitration.
24.       Turning to Mr. Hanief’s contentions on the question of
limitation, and Shah Aircon’s liability on merits, these issues are best
reserved for adjudication by the learned arbitrator. The recent
judgment of the Supreme Court in Bharat Sanchar Nigam Ltd and
Anr. vs. Nortel Networks India Pvt Ltd.25, relying upon the judgment
of a three Judge Bench in Vidya Drolia and Ors. vs. Durga Trading
15:04:08               ARB.P.621/2021                                                   Page 15 of 17
Corporation26, has clearly held that limitation is in general “a mixed
question of fact and law”27, which is in the realm of the arbitrator to
resolve. It is only in an exceptional case, where the claims are ex facie
time barred, that the Court would decline reference to arbitration
under Section 11 of the Act. In the present case, Mr. Hanief’s
argument on limitation is based upon various disputed assertions as to
the tenure of the Agreement, the credit period, etc., which are not
readily evident from the documents on record. In these circumstances,
I am unable to accept his submission that this is a case of an entirely
meritless claim, or “deadwood”, so as to justify denial of Panasonic’s
request for reference of disputes for adjudication by an arbitrator.
25.      For the reasons aforesaid, the petition succeeds, and is disposed
of with the following directions: -
a. Mr. Vidit Gupta, Advocate [Mobile No:- +91-9910995511] is
appointed as the Arbitrator to adjudicate the disputes between
the parties under the Agreement.
b. The learned Arbitrator is requested to make a declaration in
terms of Section 12 of the Act prior to entering upon the
reference.
c. The renumeration of the learned Arbitrator will be computed in
terms of Schedule IV of the Act.
d. All rights and contentions of the parties, on maintainability,
arbitrability of the claims under the Agreement, and on merits

of the claims, are left open for adjudication by the learned
