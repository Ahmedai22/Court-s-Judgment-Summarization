Writ Petition filed under Article 226 of the Constitution of India praying for
a Writ of Mandamus directing the respondents to reinstate the petitioner into
service with effect from 01.05.2021 with all consequential benefits including
monetary benefits and further permit the petitioner to continue in service till he
attains the age of 65 years.
for M/s.Menon, Karthik, Mukundan, Neelakantan
for respondents 1 to 3
and Ms.B.Priyatharsini,
The common facts and circumstances that gave rise to the filing of the
writ petitions are briefly stated hereunder:
(a) The petitioner in W.P.No.17918 of 2021 was appointed in the erstwhile
Pondicherry Engineering College, as Lecturer of Civil Engineering on 10.10.1987
and subsequently, promoted as Assistant Professor and Professor on 28.06.1999
and 13.08.2004 respectively. Later, he was given additional charge as Principal,
Pondicherry Engineering College on 08.07.2019.
(b) The petitioner in W.P.No.17929 of 2021 was appointed as Assistant
Professor on 19.08.1999 of Mechanical Engineering, subsequently promoted as
Associate Professor and Professor with effect from 01.01.2006 and 01.07.2013
respectively. The erstwhile Pondicherry Engineering college was promoted and
fully funded by the Government of Pondicherry. It was started in the year 1984
as an autonomous Institution, affiliated to the Pondicherry University. In 2019,
Government of Puducherry framed Puducherry Technological University Act,
2019 (Act 4 of 2020 dated 31.03.2020) thereby reconstituting the Pondicherry
Engineering College as a Technological University and incorporated it as an
affiliated and research University of Puducherry. The Act came into force on
(c) The erstwhile Pondicherry Engineering College before it became a
Technological University by virute of Act 4/2020 was a technical institution
governed by the All India Council for Technical Education, (hereinafter referred
to as 'the AICTE'), the fifth respondent herein. The service conditions of the
teaching staff are regulated by the instructions issued by AICTE from time to
time. The latest set of regulations issued by AICTE is as follows:
(d) The notification was issued on the first of March 2019, and made
applicable to all technical institutions in the country, effective from the date of
notification. The notification thus stood applied to the Pondicherry Engineering
College before its conversion as Technological University with effect from
(e) The grievance of the petitioners herein is that as per the latest
regulation of AICTE dated 01.03.2019, the age of superannuation of all faculty
members and Principals/Directors of institutions shall be 65 years. Further
extension of five years is also provided beyond 65 years up to 70 years of age on
fulfillment of certain conditions. However, notwithstanding the stipulation of 65
years as the age of superannuation, the petitioners herein were forcibly retired
on the date they completed 62 years of age, ostensibly on the basis of the
University stipulations in this regard. Aggrieved by their premature retirement,
the petitioners are before this Court praying for the issuance of a Writ of
Mandamus directing the third respondent University to continue their service till
they attain the age of superannuation, in terms of the AICTE regulations.
2. Mr.Karthik Rajan, learned counsel for the petitioners, would make the
following submissions:
(a) After reiterating the facts as to the status of the erstwhile
Pondicherry Engineering College and its transformation into technological
University, the learned counsel at the outset would submit that in terms of
Section 5(4) of the Act of 4/2020, dated 31.03.2020, the service conditions of the
teaching staff came to be protected as it stood applicable before the conversion
of the college into a Technological University with effect from 05.09.2020. The
effect of the saving clause is that whatever that was applicable before the
coming into force of the Technological University Act, 2019, as on 05.09.2020,
the same would be continued, and the teaching staff would be governed by such
regulations. According to him, it is, therefore, not open to the third respondent
University to have its own age of retirement in the teeth of AICTE regulations,
(b) The learned counsel would submit that the regulations
governing the service conditions of teaching staff and other academic staff
towards maintenance of standards in technical education are the result of the
exercise of power conferred under sub-Section (1) of Section 23 read with
Section 10(g), (h) and (i) of the All India Council for Technical Education Act,
1987. The learned counsel would draw the attention of this Court to certain
relevant provisions of the regulations starting from regulation 1.2, which read as
“1.2 Categories of Institutions to whom the regulations apply
These shall apply to all degree level technical
institutions  and    Universities   including   deemed    to  be
Universities imparting technical education and such other
courses / programs approved by AICTE and areas as notified
by the council from time to time.
a) Pay Scales and DA: The revised pay-scales shall be
effective from 1.1.2016.
1.4 Effective date of application of Service Conditions
a)   All    other    service    conditions    including
publications, training and course requirements etc. shall come
into force with effect from the date of this Gazette
b) The Qualifications, Experience, Recruitment and
Promotions etc. during 01-01-2016 till the issue of this Gazette
Notification shall be governed by All India Council for
Technical Education Pay Scales, Service Conditions and
Qualifications for the Teachers and other Academic Staff in
Technical Institutions (Degree) Regulation, 2010 dated 5th
March 2010 and subsequent notifications issued from time to
time.”
(c) According to the learned counsel, the regulations shall apply to
all technical institutions and Universities including deemed to be Universities and
the application of the latest regulation was with effect from the date of gazette
notification, which was on 01.03.2019. In the same breath, the learned counsel
would refer to regulation 2.12, which reads as under:
“2.12 Age of Superannuation
“The age of superannuation of all faculty members
and Principals / Directors of institutions shall be 65 years. An
extension of 5 years (till the attainment of 70 years of age)
may be given to those faculty members who are physically fit,
have written technical books, published papers and has
average 360 feedback of more than 8 out of 10 indicating them
being active during last 3 preceding years of service.”
(d) When the above regulation stipulated age of superannuation as 65
years, retiring the petitioners herein at the age of 62 in the year 2021 is directly
in contravention of the stipulation by the apex body, the fifth respondent herein.
(e) In this regard, the learned counsel would elaborate his submissions by
contending that the regulations of AICTE issued under the provisions of the
Central Act viz., All India Council for Technical Education Act, 1987, the same
would prevail in terms of the scheme of the constitution. The individual
institution or University has no option to prescribe its own age of retirement,
inconsistent with the stipulation as mandated in the AICTE regulations.
(f) The learned counsel with a view to clarify the position adopted by the
third respondent University that the age of superannuation prescribed in the
regulation is optional and the third respondent University has not adopted the
same for application to its teaching staff would submit the following:
(fa)The fifth respondent being the apex body, its regulations are
automatically applicable across the spectrum and there is no option provided to
any individual institution or University to have its own service conditions, outside
the framework of AICTE regulations.
(fb) Likewise, when the regulations are to be automatically made
applicable to all the technical institutions/Universities in the country, the
question of adopting regulations at the convenience of any University or
individual institution does not arise. As a matter of fact, the Union Government
of Puducherry adopted the 7th Central pay scale applicable to its employees as
per AICTE/UGC norms with effect from 01.01.2016. But the arrears were paid
from 01.08.2019 to all its employees.
(fc) The reasons that are set forth by the third respondent University that
by virtue of the fact that the University has its own prescription of age of
superannuation and there is no requirement to follow the regulations of AICTE
are unsustainable, not only with reference to the mandatory nature of AICTE
regulations, which are applicable pan India but with reference to the decisions of
the Hon'ble Supreme Court and High Courts.
(fd) The learned counsel then proceeded to refer to decisions of the
Hon'ble Supreme Court and High Courts in support of his contentions as under:
(a) 1995(4) SCC 104 (State of Tamil Nadu and Anr. vs. Adhiyaman
Educational & Research Institute and Ors.)
(aa) The Hon'ble Supreme Court was considering the applicability of the
provisions of AICTE and the functions of the Council established under the Act
on one side and on the other, the Acts viz., Tamil Nadu Private Regulation Act
and Rules and Madras University Act, regulating the institutions serving higher
education in the State of Tamil Nadu.
(ab) The Hon'ble Supreme Court extensively dealt with various decisions
of its own, earlier rendered on the subject matter, has finally concluded as under
in paragraph 41 of the judgment:
“41.What emerges from the above discussion is as
(i) The expression "coordination" used in Entry 66 of
the Union List of the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution
does not merely mean evaluation. It means harmonisation
with a view to forge a uniform pattern for a concerted action
according to a certain design, scheme or plan of development.
It, therefore, includes action not only for removal of
disparities in standards but also for preventing the occurrence
of such disparities. It would, therefore, also include power to
do all things which are necessary to prevent what would make
"coordination" either impossible or difficult. This power is
absolute and unconditional and in the absence of any valid
compelling reasons, it must be given its full effect according to
its plain and express intention.
(ii) To the extent that the State legislation is in conflict
with the Central legislation though the former is purported to
have been made under Entry 25 of the Concurrent List but in
effect encroaches upon legislation including subordinate
legislation made by the Centre under Entry 25 of the
Concurrent List or to give effect to Entry 66 of the Union List,
it would be void and inoperative.
(iii) If there is a conflict between the two legislations,
unless the State legislation is saved by the provisions of the
main part of clause [2] of Article 254, the State leg- islation
being repugnant to the Central legislation, the same would be
inoperative.
(iv) Whether the State law encroaches upon Entry 66
of the Union List or is repugnant to the law made by the
Centre under Entry 25 of the Concurrent List, will have to be
determined by the examination of the two laws and will
depend upon the facts of each case.”
(ac) In the above matter, the Hon'ble Supreme Court has categorically
held that when there is conflict between two legislations, the Central legislation
will prevail to the extent of repugnancy.
(ii) The learned counsel would rely on two decisions, one of Punjab and
Haryana High Court and another judgment of Karnataka High Court on the same
issue of consideration of the age of retirement, namely, difference between the
age of retirement as prescribed in AICTE regulation and the State laws
prescribing age of retirement.
(iii) The Division Bench of Punjab and Haryana High Court, in Dr.Jogender
Pal Singh and Others vs. Union of India and others, (CWP 20447-2020 dated
01.03.2021), was considering the issue exactly similar situation like the present
one as to whether AICTE regulations would apply to the institutions or Union
Territory of Puducherry Employees Rules is applicable in regard to application of
prescription of the superannuation age. The learned counsel referred to
paragraphs 8, 13 to 16, 18 to 22, 28 to 30. The said paragraphs are extracted
“8. The basic issue, which falls for consideration in
the present writ petition, is "whether the Notification dated
13.01.1992 (Annexure A-3) issued under proviso to Article
309 of the Constitution i.e. the Conditions of Services of
Union Territory of Chandigarh Employees Rules, 1992 (the
1992 Rules) would still hold the field even where it is in
conflict with the provisions of the AICTE Regulations, 2010
and 2019, which have been promulgated under the powers
conferred under sub-section (1) of Section 23 read with
Section 10 (g) (h) (i) of the AICTE Act, 1987 and in the case
of petitioner No. 2, the UGC Regulations, 2010 and the
Council of Architecture Regulations, 2017 framed under the
13. In the case of the Union Territories, the rule-
making power, no doubt, belongs to the President. Therefore,
in the case of Chandigarh, which is a Union Territory, this
power to make Rules under Article 309 is in the President.
This power has been exercised by the President while framing
the 1992 Rules. This power under Article 309 and the rules
framed under proviso thereto will operate and hold the field,
having the force of law, unless and until Parliament chooses
to legislate on the subject. Once the Parliament legislates,
such Act and the Rules/Regulations framed thereunder, would
take over the field resulting in the Rules framed by the
President under proviso to Article 309 seizing to operate
forthwith.
14. Article 246 of the Constitution of India deals with
the subject matter of laws made by the Parliament and by the
Legislatures of States. The Lists are contained in Schedule-
VII of the Constitution. Entry 66 of List-I i.e. the Union List
would be relevant for the present case, which reads as
"Entry 66. Co-ordination and determination of
standards in institutions for higher education or research and
scientific and technical institutions."
Constitution, the Union of India has promulgated and notified
the All India Council for Technical Education Act, 1987
(hereinafter referred to as the AICTE Act). Relevant
provisions of the AICTE Act read as under:-
2. Definitions.-In this Act, unless the context
otherwise requires,-
(f) "Regulations" means regulations made under this Act.
(g) "Technical Education" means programmes of education,
research and training in engineering technology, architecture,
town planning, management, pharmacy and applied arts and
crafts and such other programme or areas as the Central
Government may, in consultation with the Council, by
notification in the Official Gazette, declare;
2(h) "Technical Institution" means an institution, not being a
University, which offers courses or programmes of technical
education, and shall include such other institutions as the
Central Government may, in consultation with the Council, by
notification in the Official Gazette, declare as technical
10. Functions of the Council:
(1) It shall be the duty of the Council to take all such steps
as it may think fit for ensuring coordinated and integrated
development of technical education and maintenance of
standards and for the purposes of performing its functions
under this Act, the Council may-
(i) Lay down norms and standards for courses, curricula,
physical and instructional facilities, staff pattern, staff
qualifications,       quality  instructions,    assessment      and
(k) Grant approval for starting new technical institutions
and For introduction of new courses or programmes in
consultation with the agencies concerned;
(p)Inspect or cause to inspect any technical institution;
(1) the Council may, by notification in the Official
Gazette, make regulations not inconsistent with the provisions
of this Act, and the rules generally to carry out the purposes of
this Act.
16. The above Section 23 gives the power to the
Council to issue regulations. Exercising this power, AICTE
Regulations, 2010 were notified on 22.01.2010 (Annexure A-
10) initially by the Ministry of Human Resource Development,
Department of Higher Education, Government of India. The
age of superannuation, which was provided therein, was 65
years with a provision for re-employment on contract
appointment beyond the age of 65 years up to the age of 70
years.
Subsequently, AICTE Regulations, 2019 were issued
by Ministry of Human Resource Development, Department of
Higher Education, Government of India vide Notification
dated 01.03.2019 (Annexure A-11).
Regulation 2.12 of these AICTE Regulations, 2019,
deals with the age of superannuation, according to which, the
age    of   superannuation    of   all   faculty  members    and
Principals/Directors of institutions was fixed at 65 years with
a provision for extension of 5 years till the attainment of 70
years of age with certain other riders. This makes it clear that
the age of superannuation for the faculty members of the
Technical Institutions shall be 65 years.
18. It cannot be disputed that the regulations issued by
the AICTE, the UGC and the Council of Architecture are
binding upon the colleges and institutions covered under these
Acts, as has been held by the Supreme Court in the case of
Parshavanath Charitable Trust vs. All India Council for
Technical Education, 2013 (2) SCT 163 and in the
Foundation for ORE Fore School of Management vs. AICTE,
2019 (3) SCT 307. Thus, it can clearly be said that the
regulations issued under the Statute, which have come into
force under the Central Act, would be operative qua the
colleges/ institutions which would fall within the said
regulations and the rules framed under the proviso to Article
309 would, therefore, have to give way to the regulations in
case of there being any conflict.
In view of the above, the answer to the above posed
question in para 8 would be that AICTE Regulations
2010/2019 and Architecture Regulations 2017 shall apply in
case of conflict with the 1992 Rules.
19. Now the question would be "As to whether the
colleges, in which the petitioners served/are serving, are
governed by the provisions of the above-referred to Acts and
Regulations or not ?"
20. The definitions as far as the AICTE Act, 1987 is
concerned, as reproduced above, would show that Section 2
(g) defines 'Technical Education', which means programmes
of education, research and training followed by various fields
and trades which includes 'architecture' as well as 'applied
arts and crafts'. Section 2 (h) defines 'Technical Institution',
which means an institution which offers courses or
programmes of technical education but not being a University.
There is no denial to the aspect that the two colleges, where
the petitioners are/were working, are being run by the
Chandigarh Administration and are imparting education in
the field of 'applied arts and crafts' and 'architecture' and,
therefore, would fall within the definition of 'Technical
petitioners No. 1, 3 to 5 and Architecture Regulations, 2017
qua petitioner No. 2 would be applicable to the faculty
members of these colleges. The age of superannuation, as per
these regulations, shall be 65 years with a provision for
extension of 5 years subject to fulfilment of the further
requirements of the regulations as laid down therein.
22. The stand of the respondents primarily is that
these regulations are not applicable which appears to be
without any basis. The respondents have tried to assert that
the colleges, which are being run by the Chandigarh
Administration, do not fall within the ambit of Central
Government Institutions or centrally funded institutions. It
has further been asserted that these colleges are not funded by
the Central Government but are funded by the Chandigarh
However, the aspect that all the funds are provided by
the Central Government could not be disputed by the counsel
for the Chandigarh Administration. Once the funds have been
provided by the Central Government, merely because the same
were being distributed and utilized by the Chandigarh
Administration for running the colleges would not bring it
outside the ambit of the centrally funded institutions and in
any case, that would not be a requirement per se for the
applicability of the AICTE and/or Architecture Regulations.
28. In view of the above, we are of the considered view
that the services of the petitioners are governed by the AICTE
Regulations, 2010/2019, according to which, the age of
superannuation of the petitioners would be 65 years with
provision for extension of 5 years subject to the requirements
of the Regulations. and, therefore, the action of the
respondents in declining the representations/claim of the
petitioners for continuing them in service till the age of 65
years as per the AICTE Regulations/Architecture Regulations
is unsustainable.
29. As held above, the Conditions of Service of Union
Territory of Chandigarh Employees Rules, 1992 issued vide
Notification dated 13.01.1992 (Annexure A-3) would not be
applicable to the petitioners so far as they are inconsistent
with the Architecture Regulations, 2017 qua petitioner No. 2
and AICTE Regulations qua other petitioners as they cease to
operate from the date the above Regulations came into effect
respectively. The action of respondents No. 4 to 7 retiring the
petitioners at the age of 60 years i.e. 58 years with 2 years
extension by applying the Conditions of Service of Union
Territory of Chandigarh Employees Rules, 1992 as notified on
13.01.1992 (Annexure A-3) is illegal and thus set aside.
30. The writ petition stands allowed by setting aside
the order dated 29.09.2020/27.10.2020 (Annexure P-8) passed
by the Central Administrative Tribunal, Chandigarh Bench.
A direction is issued to the respondents to take back
the petitioners who have been forcibly superannuated by them
by giving effect to the 1992 Rules. They shall also be entitled
to the all consequential benefits. The consequential benefits be
released to the said petitioners within a period of two months
from the date of receipt of certified copy of the order.”
(iv) The above extensive discussion of the Division Bench of the High
Court on the subject-matter would unequivocally support the contention that
AICTE regulation is mandatory and no option is available for any institution or
University coming under its purview having different conditions of service
contrary to the AICTE regulations. According to the learned counsel, as against
the said decision of the Division Bench, an appeal was filed before the Hon'ble
Supreme Court and eventually, the same was withdrawn by the State and an
order was also passed to that effect dismissing the appeal in SLP(C) Nos.12454
to 12455 of 2021 on 15.12.2021. The order of the Division Bench has thus
become final.
(v) The learned counsel would then refer to a decision of the Karnataka
High Court rendered in W.P.No.15421/2020 (Dr.G.R.Bharat Sai Kumar vs. State
of Karnataka, decided on 24.05.2021). There again, the issue was determination
of the age of superannuation and whether AICTE regulation enhancing the age
of retirement could be said to be applicable to any aided educational institution.
In the said factual context, a reference could be made to paragraphs 13 to 15,
19 to 21.
“13. The mandatory nature of the Regulations notified
by the AICTE applicable to degree level institutions is
considered by the Apex Court in the case of Parshvanath
Charitable Trust v. All India Council for Technical Education
reported in (2013) 3 SCC 385, which reads as follows:
"25. It is also a settled principle that the regulations
framed by the Central authorities such as AICTE have the
force of law and are binding on all concerned. Once approval
is granted or declined by such expert body, the courts would
normally not substitute their view in this regard. Such expert
views would normally be accepted by the court unless the
powers vested in such expert body are exercised arbitrarily,
capriciously or in a manner impermissible under the
Regulations and the AICTE Act."
(Emphasis supplied) In terms of the afore-extracted
judgment of the Apex Court it becomes unmistakably clear
that AICTE Regulations notified by Government of India
would have binding effect on the institutes to whom the
Regulations apply.
14. The emphasis in the afore-extracted Regulations of
the AICTE is that it regulates service conditions of faculty
members of the Institutes regulated by AICTE. Regulation 1.2
mandates that it applies to all degree level Technical Institutes
and Universities. Regulation 2.12 unequivocally depicts that
age of superannuation of all faculty members, Principals and
Directors of the Institutes which would mean degree level
technical institutes shall be 65 years and discretion is vested
with the Institutes to extend it up to 70 years. The mandatory
nature of the direction is with regard to the age of
superannuation being 65 years and the directory nature of the
Regulations is an extension to 70 years from 65 years.
Therefore, any Institute being regulated in terms of
Regulation 1.2 would be bound by the service conditions
stipulated in the Regulations.
It is not in dispute that norms and standards
prescribed by the AICTE regulate the service conditions of the
faculty of the 4th respondent/Institute.
15. It is also not in dispute and cannot be disputed that
the faculty of the fourth respondent are appointed in terms of
the norms of the AICTE from time to time and are in receipt
of every benefit that is regulated in terms of the Regulations
(supra) with regard to pay, allowances, facilities and all other
service conditions. One such illustration is an advertisement
issued by the Institute calling for applications for various
posts which displays the following:
19. It is not be mistaken that the petitioner is seeking a
writ at the hands of this Court for a direction to the 4th
respondent to implement a Government order. The case of the
petitioner is that he is entitled to continue up to the age of 65
years on the strength of the Regulations of AICTE which bind
the 4th respondent/Institute. It is, therefore, the writ petition
would     become     maintainable      even   against    the   4th
respondent/Institute, more so, in the light of the fact that
Professors in the VTU retire at the age of 62 years which is
also governed by AICTE Act and the Norms and Standards
and the Professors in the 4th respondent/Institute retire at 60
years which is also governed by the same provisions of the
AICTE Act and Norms and Standards, which clearly depict
different ages of retirement despite being governed by the very
same Regulations.
Uniformity in application of statute in every case will
drive away arbitrariness in action and would be in consonance
with Article 14 of the Constitution of India failing which,
every Institute that is governed by a solitary Regulation would
become free to adopt Service Conditions at their whim and
fancy. This cannot be the purport of the mandate of the
AICTE Act or the Regulations in notifying the Service
Conditions applicable to all faculty of Institutes which come
under its purview.
20. Insofar as judgments relied on by the learned
Senior Council appearing for the 4th respondent is concerned,
in the case of Jagdish Prasad Sharma, the issue that fell for
consideration before the Apex Court was whether a
communication of the University Grants Commission for
enhancement of age of superannuation would become binding
on the Institutes. The Apex Court in the very judgment clearly
holds that the Central Government itself took a decision that
discretion of the State Government should not be fettered by
extension of financial initiative insofar as it pertains to
directions issued by the UGC for implementation of
enhancement of age of superannuation of teachers and other
staff from 62 years to 65 years. The relevant portion of the
judgment of the Apex Court reads as follows:-
"65. We are then faced with the situation where a
composite scheme has been framed by the UGC, whereby the
Commission agreed to bear 80% of the expenses incurred by
the State in such scheme was to be accepted, subject to the
condition that the remaining 20% of the expense would be met
by the State and that on and from 1st April, 2010, the State
Government would take over the entire burden and would also
have enhanced the age of superannuation of teachers and
other staff from 62 to 65 years. There being no compulsion to
accept and/or adopt the said scheme, the States are free to
decide as to whether the scheme would be adopted by them or
not. In our view, there can be no automatic application of the
recommendations made by the Commission, without any
conscious decision being taken by the State in this regard, on
account of the financial implications and other consequences
attached to such a decision. The case of those petitioners who
have claimed hat they should be given the benefit of the
scheme dehors the responsibility attached thereto, must,
therefore, fail."
(Emphasis supplied) The Apex Court clearly holds
that there is no compulsion to accept or adopt the UGC
scheme which enhanced the age of superannuation from 62 to
65 years. The Regulations of the AICTE applicable to the case
at hand are mandatory in nature and do not leave any
discretion to the degree level institutions to implement it or
otherwise, as it is couched in such language that following
mandate of the Regulations would be in consonance with the
maintenance of minimum standards             of teaching and
appointment of faculties in all the degree level technical
institutions. Therefore, the judgment in the case of Jagdish
Prasad Sharma, in my considered view, would be inapplicable
to the facts obtaining in the case at hand.
21. Wherefore, I deem it appropriate to follow the
judgments cited by the learned Senior Counsel appearing for
the petitioner quoted (supra) and not the one relied on by the
learned     Senior    Counsel      appearing   for    the   4th
respondent/Institute.”
(vi) The above decision once again reaffirms the mandatory nature of
applicability of AICTE regulations.
(vii) The learned counsel would also refer to a latest Division Bench
decision of this Court reported in 2021 SCC OnLine Mad 2946 (V.Lekha vs.
Chairman, U.G.C. & Ors.). According to the learned counsel, the above decision
dealt with the issue as to whether the Central legislation will prevail in terms of
Entry 66 of List I or Entry 25 (List III) of the Seventh Schedule to the
Constitution enabling the State to enact legislation in the shared legislative field.
The Division Bench after elaborate discussion held as under:
“105. From the above, it could be seen that the power
of the State Legislature is not altogether excluded, but it is
restricted and circumscribed to the Central enactment. The
emphasis highlighted by the Apex Court is the determination
of   uniform     minimum    standards   in    higher  education
nationwide.
106. When the above ruling is to be applied in this
case, the requirement of the minimum qualification of ML
Degree and enrollment as advocate is a clear instance of
varying the minimum standards fixed by the Central body. In
that view of the matter and to that extent, the two Government
Orders,    viz.,   G.O.Ms.No.1349     dated    19.11.1985  and
G.O.Ms.No.264 dated 20.12.2005, are to be necessarily held as
invalid as it originated from colourable legislation.
107. As a matter of fact, the learned counsel for the
BCI has very rightly and importantly cited three Constitution
Bench decisions apart from two other decisions of the Hon'ble
Supreme Court. The decisions cited are, [1] AIR 1953 SC 375
2009 [4] SCC 590 ; and [5] 2020 SCC Online SC 699 [CB].
The relevant paragraphs of the decision have been extracted
supra. From the cumulative reading of the decisions of the
Hon'ble    Supreme     Court    of  India    and  the  relevant
Constitutional Entries in the Seventh Schedule of the
Constitution and the Doctrine of Pith and Substance in terms
of Article 246 of the Constitution of India, this Court has to
come to an inexorable conclusion that the prescription of
additional qualifications, viz., M.L.Degree, and enrollment as
advocate, suffers from lack of legislative competence.
108. The qualifications prescribed by the State
authority may appear to be in addition to minimum standards
laid down by the Central Regulating body, but the
qualifications being ex facie irrational, arbitrary and
unreasonable are in reality in conflict with the minimum
standard fixed by the Central Regulating Body nationally.
Further, irrationality and arbitrariness would also result in
exclusion of the whole lot of candidates from even
consideration or participation in the recruitment process, even
though they are qualified in terms of the Central Regulating
Body. This Court has to necessarily conclude that the
additional qualifications prescribed, run afoul of the
qualifications prescribed by the Central Regulating Authority.
viz., the BCI and the qualifications thus, are repugnant to the
Central Legislation and cannot pass the test of constitutional
scrutiny.”
(viii) Here again, the Division Bench of this Court has ruled that in the
field of higher education, the central enactment will prevail.
(ix) Lastly, the learned counsel would refer to the order of a learned
Single Judge of this Court dated 26.11.2009 in W.P.No.10049/2004 (S.Palanivel
vs. Principal, Pondicherry Engineering College).
(x) The learned counsel would particularly place reliance on paragraphs 6,
7 and 14 to 16.
“6.The first respondent college filed counter statement
stating that the college is run by a Society registered under the
Societies Registration Act and sponsored by Government of
Union Territory Pondicherry and stated that the first
respondent college is governed by an administrative body of
the college, which has framed its own regulations relating to
the conditions of service of the employees viz. both the
members of teaching faculties as well as administrative staff.
Regarding the claim of the petitioner placement to senior scale
and selection grade scale, it is stated that the college is bound
to take only the service of the employee in the first respondent,
and that first respondent was not intimated about the adoption
of UGC guidelines issued by AICTE for counting of past
service in other institutions. It is further stated in para 6 of the
counter affidavit that even if the said communication is
received from AICTE, it is not binding on the college and it
cannot accept any recommendations of AICTE, unless it is
approved by the Governing Body.
7.In para 8 of the counter affidavit it is categorically
stated that UGC itself pointed out that even in para 8.0.0 it is
stated it is the guideline and not a direction which is
mandatory. In para 17 of the counter affidavit, it is stated that
ACTE guidelines are not mandatory in respect of service
conditions of the first respondent institution and AICTE has
no jurisdiction to the service matters of the employees of
technical institution as could be seen in Section 10(1) of the
AICTE Act 1987. With regard to the service matter of the
employees of the college including the teachers the decision of
the Governing Body will be binding on the college and not the
guidelines of the AICTE or UGC.
12.On the other hand Mrs.Mala, learned counsel for
the first respondent reiterating the counter filed by the first
respondent submitted that governing body of the institution
has to pass resolution with regard to adopting guidelines for
its employees.
"AICTE notification on revision of pay scales and
associated terms and conditions of service of Teachers,
Librarians and Physical Education personnel of Degree level
which states in clause 15.1 that the implementation of the
revised scale of pay would be subject to acceptance of all the
conditions mentioned in the scheme as well as other terms and
conditions issued by the AICTE in this behalf. By relying
upon the said terms, he submitted that AICTE itself has
accepted the importance of the decision to be taken by the
institutions. When such is the position only after getting
approval from the general body, the instructions could be
implemented by the first respondent.
14.It is not in dispute that the petitioner had worked as
lecturer in Regional Engineering College Warangal and as a
scientist Grade IV at Structural Engineering Research Centre,
CSIR, Chennai for more than six years. When UGC and
AiCTE regulations unequivocally stated that past services of
the candidates have to be considered for Career Advancement
Scheme to move into cadre of Senior scale, the first
respondent institution is bound to follow the same. As rightly
pointed out by Mr.V.Perumal, learned counsel for the
petitioner as well as Mr.N.Muralikumaran, learned Central
Government Standing counsel, the first respondent institution
cannot insist the guidelines from the second respondent. The
regulations are subordinate legislation and they are to be
treated as statute. When such is the position, the stand of the
second respondent that guidelines are to be approved by a
resolution of first respondent's general body has no leg to
stand and it has to be negatived. If such a stand is to be
approved, it would be ultravires of UGC Act and AICTE and
it will not be in the interest of development and acceleration of
Career Advancement scheme for higher education in this
country. It is seen from petitioner's typed set of papers that
Anna University, Chennai counted past service of one
Mr.R.Bhuvaneswaran for career advancement as early as on
10.8.1999. When that is the position, there cannot be any
prohibition for the first respondent to follow the same.
15.The courts have recognised the importance of All
India Councils for higher education namely medical council
in the medical field and technical council for technical
education. These councils are expert bodies and they are alone
competent to give guidelines in the respective fields. When
such is the position, the stand taken in the counter affidavit
filed by the first respondent that AICTE regulations are not
mandatory in respect of service condition and that the State
has no jurisdiction on service matters are all without any
substance and such contention should not be allowed to be
raised by the institution, which will go against the intention of
the legislature/parliament and it has to be discourage and
condemned.
16. As rightly pointed out by Mr.Perumal, learned
counsel for the petitioner that the first respondent institute
itself has taken into consideration the past services of
Dr.Nagarajan, Mr.S.Gothandaraman and Dr.Paramanandan
for senior scale. Subsequently in 57th governing body of the
Engineering college (Pondicherry) Society held on 16.2.2006
adopted the revised Career Advancement Scheme issued by the
AICTE by the first respondent college. In view of the above
subsequent development also, the petitioner has to succeed in
the writ petition. Even otherwise, by G.O.Ms.No.103 dated
22.9.2009, the government of Pondicherry implemented VI Pay
Commission recommendation and thereby the petitioner is
eligible to be appointed as lecturer. There is no reason
available for the first respondent to deny the said right to the
petitioner, which only go to show that the petitioner alone was
subject to discriminatory treatment for no fault on his part.
Violating Article 14 of the Constitution of India as held by the
Hon'ble Supreme Court, in (2009) 7 SCC 734 and 2004 (12)
SCC 540 there cannot be discrimination between similarly
situated. Therefore the petitioner should be extended the same
benefit given to the aforesaid similarly placed persons.”
(xi) In that case, a stand was taken by the Pondicherry Engineering
College that the UGC and AICTE's regulations have not been approved by the
college and no resolution to that effect was passed by the general body and
therefore, the same would not be applicable. The learned Single Judge repulsed
the said contention stating such stand is ultra vires the UGC and AICTE
regulations which are subordinate legislation and have the force of a statute.
The learned Judge went on to hold any contention that UGC and AICTE
regulations/ guidelines are not mandatory is without substance and the same
has to be discouraged and condemned.
(xii)The learned counsel would therefore sum up that the principal issue is
no longer res integra and as such, it is not open to the third respondent
University to refuse to toe the line of the AICTE stipulations by prescribing its
own age of retirement, contrary to the regulations.
3. On behalf of the respondents 1 to 4, Ms.N.Mala, learned Government
Pleader (Puducherry) appeared and she made her submissions as follows:
(a) Her principal contention opposing the relief as prayed for by the
petitioners herein is that option is available to the University to follow the age of
superannuation stipulated by AICTE or it can prescribe its own age of retirement.
(b) The contention is entirely premised on a particular clause in the
stipulation of AICTE regulation, 2019. She would refer to regulations 2.11
“Financial Assistance from Government of India for implementation of 7th CPC
Scale.” The clauses contained therein are extracted herein.
“2.11 Financial Assistance from Government of India for
implementation of 7th CPC scale.
The Central Government shall provide by way of
financial assistance, 50% of the additional expenditure
(arrears from 01.01.2016 till 31.03.2019) on implementing the
revised scales of pay for faculty and other staff such as
Library,   Physical  Education     and    Training Placement
Personnel in State Government/Government Aided /State
Government     Autonomous       institutions/State University
a) Financial assistance from the Central Government to State
/ UT Governments for revising pay scales of teachers and
other staff such as Library, Physical Education and Training
Placement Personnel under the scheme shall be limited, by
way of reimbursement, to the extent of 50% (fifty percent) of
the additional expenditure involved after payment of arrears to
eligible faculty members in the implementation of the revision,
for the Universities, colleges and other technical education
institutions funded by the State / UT Government. For this,
State / UT Governments shall submit the claim to the Central
Government. All such claims must be submitted to the Central
Government by the state / UT on or before 31.03.2020. No
claim of the State / UT Government shall be condidered for
financial assistance after 31.03.2020.
b) Financial assistance referred to in sub-clause (a) above
shall be provided for the period from 01.01.2016 to 31.03.2019
only.
c) The entire liability on account of revision of pay scales etc.
with effect from 01.04.2019 shall be taken over by the State /
UT Government opting for revision of pay scales.
d) Financial assistance from the Central Government shall be
restricted to revision of pay scales and not for any other
allowances and in respect of only those posts which were in
existence and had been filled up on regular basis as on
e) State / UT Governments, taking into consideration other
local conditions, may also decide at their discretion, to
introduce pay higher than those mentioned in this Scheme,
and shall give effect to the revised scales of pay from
01.01.2016;     however,in     such    cases,   the    details  of
modifications proposed shall be furnished to the Central
Government and Central assistance shall be restricted to the
Pay as approved by the Central Government and not to any
higher pay fixed by the State / UT Government(s).
f) Payment of Central assistance for implementing this
Scheme is also subject to the condition that the entire Scheme
of revision of pay scales together with all the conditions laid
down by the AICTE by way of Regulations and other
guidelines shall be implemented by State / UT Governments
and technical institutions coming under their jurisdiction as a
composite scheme.
g) An undertaking shall be taken from every beneficiary under
this Scheme to the effect that any excess payment made on
account of incorrect fixation of pay or due to any other reason
shall be adjusted against the future payments due or otherwise
to the beneficiary in the same manner as provided in this HRD
Ministry’s O.M. No. F.23-7/2008-IFD dated 23.01.2008, read
with Ministry of Finance (Department of Expenditure) O.M.
No. F.1-1/2CQ8-IC dated 30.08.2008.
h) The revised pay including arrears of salary and applicable
allowances from the date of application as mentioned above
shall be paid to all eligible beneficiaries under this scheme.”
(c) According to the learned Government Pleader, from the cumulative
reading of the above clauses, it could be deduced that an option is available if
only University/institution is complying with the entire AICTE scheme/ regulation.
She would particularly place emphasis on sub-clause (f) as extracted above, in
this regard. According to the learned Government Pleader, the University had
taken a decision not to take any financial assistance from the Central
Government in respect of the arrears of pay to be paid to its employees on
account of revision of pay scales in pursuance of its implementation of the VII
CPC and restricted its payments only from 01.08.2019. In the absence of seeking
central assistance towards payment of arrears of revision of payment to its
employees from 01.01.2016 in terms of clause 2.11 of the AICTE regulations,
there cannot be any insistence of automatic applicability of prescription of age of
superannuation in terms of regulation 2.12. According to her, sub-Clause (f)
clearly stipulates that the scheme of AICTE is to be applicable only when the
entire scheme is adopted by an university or institution.
(d) According to the learned counsel, revision of pay of teachers and
increased age of superannuation would not become effective, as conditions of
service of the State/ Union Territory Government colleges were within the
domain of the State Government/Union Territory Government, till such time as it
has decided to adopted the same. The essence and substance of the stand of
the Government is reflected in three paragraphs as contained in the counter-
affidavit filed on behalf of respondents 1 to 4 herein. The relevant paragraphs
10 to 12 are extracted hereunder:
“10. I respectfully submit to state that on mere
communication of gazette notification by All India Council for
Technical Education, the revision of the pay of teachers and
increase in the age of superannuation would not automatically
become effective and that, in any event, the right to alter the
terms and conditions of service of the State / UT Governments
colleges were within the domain of the State Government/ UT
Governments and till such time as it decided to adopt the
same, the same would have no application to the teachers and
staff of the technical institutions in the State/ UT
11. I respectfully submit to state that purport the
scheme to enhance the pay of the teachers and connected staff
in the State/UT Government technical institutions and also to
increase their age of superannuation from 62 to 65 years. The
scheme provides that if it was accepted by the concerned State/
UT Governments, the Central Government would bear 50% of
the expenses on account of such enhancement in the pay
structure and the remaining 50% would have to be borne by
the State. This would be for the period commencing from 1st
January, 2016, till 31st March, 2019, after which the entire
liability on account of revision of pay-scales would have to be
taken over by the State UT Governments. Furthermore,
financial assistance from the Central Government would be
restricted to revision of pay-scales in respect of only those
posts which were in existence and had been filled up as on 1st
January, 2016. While most of the States / UT Governments
were willing to adopt the scheme, for the purpose of receiving
50% of the salary of the teachers and other staff from the
Central Government which would reduce their liability to 50%
only, they were unwilling to accept the scheme in its composite
form which not only entailed acceptance of the increase in the
retirement age from 62 to 65 years, but also shifted the total
liability in regard to the increase in the pay- scales to the
States/UT Governments, after 1st April, 2019.
12. I respectfully submit that there being no
compulsion to accept and/or adopt the said scheme, the
State/UT Governments are free to decide as whether the
scheme would be adopted by them or not. Further , there can
be no automatic application of the recommendations made by
the Council, without any conscious decision being taken by the
State/UT Governments in this regard on account of the
financial implications and other consequences attached to
such a decision. The case of the Petitioners have claimed that
they should be allowed to continue in service till they attain
the 65 years de hors the responsibility attached thereto, must,
therefore, fail.”
(e) She would lay emphasis on the above averments in the counter-
affidavit and submit that there is no need or necessary to change the service
conditions of the employees of the Union Territory as it would fall within the
domain of the State/Union Territory and in any event, unless the regulations of
AICTE are specifically adopted, it cannot on its own be stated to be applicable.
(f) The learned counsel in her turn referred to a decision of the Hon'ble
Supreme Court in the decision of Jagdish Prasad Sharma vs. State of Bihar and
ors. (Civil Appeal Nos.5527 to 5543 of 2013) dated 17.07.2013.
(g) She particularly placed reliance on paragraphs 58 to 65. According to
the learned counsel, the Hon'ble Supreme Court has held that there is no
compulsion to adopt the scheme of UGC and in such event, there is no question
of mandatory application of AICTE stipulation as well. Paragraphs 58 to 65 are
reproduced hereunder:
“58. However, in the instant case, the said questions
do not arise, inasmuch as, as mentioned hereinabove, the
acceptance of the scheme in its composite form was made
discretionary and, therefore, there was no compulsion on the
State and its authorities to adopt the scheme. The problem lies
in the desire of the State and its Authorities to obtain the
benefit of 80% of the salaries of the teachers and other staff
under the scheme, without increasing the age of retirement
from 62 to 65 years, or the subsequent condition regarding the
taking over of the scheme with its financial implications from
59. As far as the States of Kerala and U.P. are
concerned, they have their own problems which are localised
and stand on a different footing from the other States, none of
whom who appear to have the same problem. Education now
being a List III subject, the State Government is at liberty to
frame its own laws relating to education in the State and is
not, therefore, bound to accept or follow the Regulations
framed by the UGC. It is only natural that if they wish to
adopt the Regulations framed by the Commission under
Section 26 of the UGC Act, 1956, the States will have to abide
by the conditions as laid down by the Commission.
60. That leaves us with the question which is special to
the State of Bihar, i.e., the effect of Section 67(a) introduced
into the Bihar State Universities Act, 1976, by the Bihar State
Universities (Amendment) Act, 2006, and the corresponding
amendments made in the Patna University Act, 1976. Section
67(a) has been extracted herein before in Paragraph 13.
While, on the one hand, it has been mentioned that
notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in any
Act, Rules, Statutes, Regulation or Ordinance, the date of
retirement of a teaching employee of the university or of a
college shall be the date on which he attains the age of 62
years, the confusion is created by the next sentence which
further provides that the date of retirement of a teaching
employee would be the same which would be decided by the
UGC. It has been urged that the said provision clearly
contemplates that in the event of an alteration resulting in an
upward revision of the age of superannuation, the same would
automatically apply to all such teachers and staff, without any
further decision of the State and its authorities in that regard.
In other words, what has been sought to be urged is that when
in regard to Centrally-funded universities, colleges and
educational institutions, the age of superannuation has been
increased to 65 years by the University Grants Commission,
the same has to uniformly apply to all universities and colleges
throughout the country, without any discrimination. The same
did not necessitate any separate decision to be taken by the
State and its authorities regarding the applicability of the
decision taken by the University Grants Commission.
61. The said submission, in our view, is not acceptable
on account of the fact that in the first paragraph of the said
Section it has been categorically stated that the age of
superannuation would be 62 years. The second paragraph of
the said section makes it even more clearer, since it reiterates
that the date of retirement of non-teaching employees, other
than the inferior servants, shall be the date on which he
attains the age of 62 years. The first proviso also indicates that
the university shall, in no case, extend the period of service of
any of the teaching or non- teaching employee after he attains
the age of 62 years. The second proviso, however, states that
even after retirement, teachers may be reappointed in
appropriate cases up to the age of 65 years in the manner laid
down in the Statutes made in this behalf in accordance with
the guidelines of the Commission.
62. As against the above, certain writ petitions have
been filed in the Patna High Court which rejected the
contention of the Petitioners and dismissed the writ petitions
on the ground that the Commission had not taken any
conscious decision with regard to teachers and staff, except
for   those   which    were   Centrally-funded.    Subsequently,
however, since in its 452nd meeting the Commission took a
conscious decision and recommended that the Report of the
Pay Review Committee recommending the enhancement of age
of superannuation from 62 to 65 years be made applicable
throughout the country, fresh writ petitions were filed in the
Patna High Court, including CWJC No.2330 of 2009, filed by
the Appellants herein. The learned Single Judge allowed the
writ petitions upon holding that once the Commission had
recommended that the age of superannuation be accepted as
65 years, the State Governments had no discretion but to
enhance the age of superannuation in line with the
recommendations made by the Commission. The Division
Bench subsequently reversed the finding of the learned Single
Judge, resulting in these Special Leave Petitions (now
63. Learned Standing Counsel for the State of Bihar,
Mr. Gopal Singh, had in his submissions reiterated the views
of the High Court, i.e., that on mere communication, the
revision of the pay of teachers and increase in the age of
superannuation would not automatically become effective and
that, in any event, the right to alter the terms and conditions of
service of the State universities and colleges were within the
domain of the State Government and till such time as it
decided to adopt the same, the same would have no application
to the teachers and staff of the different educational
institutions in the State.
64. We are inclined to agree with such submission
mainly because of the fact that in the amended provisions of
Section 67(a) it has been categorically stated that the age of
superannuation of non-teaching employees would be 62 years
and, in no case, should the period of service of such non-
teaching employees be extended beyond 62 years. A difference
had been made in regard to the teaching faculty whose
services could be extended up to 65 years in the manner laid
down in the University Statutes. There is no ambiguity that the
final decision to enhance the age of superannuation of
teachers within a particular State would be that of the State
itself. The right of the Commission to frame Regulations
having the force of law is admitted. However, the State
Governments are also entitled to legislate with matters
relating to education under Entry 25 of List III. So long as the
State legislation did not encroach upon the jurisdiction of
Parliament, the State legislation would obviously have
primacy over any other law. If there was any legislation
enacted by the Central Government under Entry 25 List III,
both would have to be treated on a par with each other. In the
absence of any such legislation by the Central Government
under Entry 25 List III, the Regulation framed by way of
delegated legislation has to yield to the plenary jurisdiction of
the State Government under Entry 25 of List III.
65. We are then faced with the situation where a
composite scheme has been framed by the UGC, whereby the
Commission agreed to bear 80% of the expenses incurred by
the State if such scheme was to be accepted, subject to the
condition that the remaining 20% of the expense would be met
by the State and that on and from 1st April, 2010, the State
Government would take over the entire burden and would also
have enhanced the age of superannuation of teachers and
other staff from 62 to 65 years. There being no compulsion to
accept and/or adopt the said scheme, the States are free to
decide as to whether the scheme would be adopted by them or
not. In our view, there can be no automatic application of the
recommendations made by the Commission, without any
conscious decision being taken by the State in this regard, on
account of the financial implications and other consequences
attached to such a decision. The case of those Petitioners who
have claimed that they should be given the benefit of the
scheme dehors the responsibility attached thereto, must,
therefore, fail.”
(h) The learned counsel would also rely on a communication of the
University Grants Commission to all Registrars of Central/Deemed Universities,
dated 04.04.2007, enhancing the age of superannuation from 62 to 65 years for
teaching positions. The communication was in pursuance of the decision taken
by the UGC dated 23.03.2007 enhancing age of superannuation as above and
according to the learned counsel, the enhancement was confined only to those
institutions as against the sanctioned posts to central funded higher technical
education. According to her, the same analogy would hold good for the
applicability of the AICTE regulations as well.
(i) Her principal submission is, in terms of clause 2.11 availing of financial
assistance from Government of India for payments towards arrears of revised
payments from 01.01.2016 till 31.03.2019 is a condition precedent for
applicability of clause 2.12 prescribing age of superannuation. In the absence of
the respondent University availing the central financial assistance, as it restricted
the arrears of revised payments only from 01.08.2019, it cannot per se be
argued that age of superannuation prescribed by AICTE regulations ought to be
mandatorily followed. She would therefore submit that the writ petitions are
bereft of merits and are liable to be dismissed.
(j) By way of reply, Mr.Karthik Rajan, learned counsel would submit that
the primary contention of the learned counsel appearing for the respondent
University is fallacious and misconceived. According to the learned counsel, the
clauses as contained under the caption “Financial Assistance from Government
of India for implementation of 7th CPC scale” as contained under Stipulation
2.11 are only in respect of revision of pay scales with effect from 01.01.2006 till
31.03.2019. The Central Finance Assistance was available only for the said
period and thereafter, from 01.04.2019, the liability was to be taken over by the
State Government/ Union Territory. In the instance case, the respondent
University opted for revision of pay scales and given effect to such revision
notionally from 01.01.2016 and restricted the arrears of pay from 01.08.2019.
(k) According to the learned counsel, the argument centered on Clause
2.11 should be read in conjunction with regulation 1.3 which provides for coming
into force of the revised pay scale from 01.01.2016. These clauses are only
related to the revision of pay scales and grant of arrears and have no nexus to
the prescription of the age of superannuation which is mandatory in nature.
(l) As regards the reliance placed by the learned counsel on the decision
of the Hon'ble Supreme Court, the learned counsel for the petitioners would
submit that the reference to the Hon'ble Supreme Court decision is erroneous for
the simple reason that that was a case relating to the applicability of UGC
regulations. UGC regulations itself was held to be discretionary in nature where
stipulation therein was confined only to certain positions centrally funded. As a
matter of fact, the learned counsel would refer to the same decision and submit
that the Hon'ble Supreme Court has factually found therein that UGC stipulation
had not made the scheme compulsory and there was no compulsion to accept or
adopt the said scheme. On finding of fact, the Hon'ble Supreme Court has held
that there was no compulsion to adopt the age of prescription of the age of
superannuation. But on the other hand, the Courts have held that the AICTE
regulations are mandatory and no option is available for any institution or
University from having a different condition of service in contravention of the
regulations. Therefore, the arguments put-forth on behalf of the respondent
University cannot be countenanced both in law and on facts.
4. This Court in the course of the hearing with a view to obtain certain
clarifications has suo motu impleaded AICTE as a party respondent in these
proceedings. On behalf of the AICTE Ms.AL.Gandhimathi appeared. On a
direction from this Court, counter-affidavit has also been filed by AICTE. In the
counter-affidavit, it is admitted that all technical institutions are governed under
the regulations of AICTE dated 01.03.2019 including prescription of age of
superannuation. It is useful to refer to the statements contained in the counter-
affidavit filed on behalf of the fifth respondent AICTE in paragraphs 4 to 6.
“4. Further AICTE publishes Approval Process
Handbook every year which provides the regulations and
procedures which is applicable to all AICTE approved
institutions. Clause 7.16 of Approval Process Handbook 2021-
2022 which provides as follows:
follow Faculty Cadre and Qualifications as
provided in the Appendix 8 of the Approval
Institutions shall be 65 years. An extension of
5 years (till the attainment of 70 years of age)
maybe given to those faculty members who are
physically fit, have written Technical Books,
published     papers   and   has   average   360
5. Further, the Government of Tamil Nadu under
G.O.Ms.No.51 dated 07.05.2020 had increased the age of
superannuation of Government servants from 58 years to 59
years and subsequently Government of Tamil Nadu under
G.O.Ms.No.92 dated 13.09.2021 had increased the age of
superannuation of Government servants from 59 to 60 years
which was made applicable to all teaching and non-teaching
staff working in aided educational institutions.
6. I respectfully submit there are no separate
regulations of AICTE relating to stand alone institutions on
the issue of age of retirement. All institutions are governed
under the regulations dated 01.03.2019 and the approval
process handbook of AICTE, which provides the age of
superannuation of all faculty members, Principals/Directors
of institutions shall be 65 years.”
5. Apart from filing the above counter-affidavit, the learned counsel has
also circulated a decision of the Bombay High Court reported in 2021 SCC
OnLine Bom3649 (Lalit Rajendra Gajanan vs. Vidyavardhani, thorugh
its Secretary). The learned counsel would refer to the decision in order to
bolster her submission that AICTE regulations will prevail over the State
enactment. The Bombay High Court was seized of the issue as to whether the
age of superannuation was to be made applicable in terms of AICTE regulations
or the resolution passed by the higher education Department of the State. There
was a conflict between the State Government's prescription of 58 years of age
and AICTE prescription of 60 or 62 years as the case may be. In consideration of
the issue therein, the Bombay High Court has finally held that the age of
superannuation should be 60 years and not 58 years. It is useful to refer to the
decision and the final reasoning of the High Court as under:
“62. The MEPS Act is a State Legislature. In exercise
of its legislative power under Article 246(3) of the
Constitution, the MEPS Act has been enacted in relation to
the subject mentioned in Entry 25 of List III (Concurrent List)
viz. “Education, including technical education, medical
education and Universities subject to the provisions of entries
63, 64, 65 and 66 of List I, vocational and technical training
of labour.
Parliament in exercise of its legislative power under Article
246(1) and (2) read with Entry 66 of List I bdp 29 wp-3125.20
& ors(j).doc (Union List) and Entry 25 of List III (State List).
64. The Hon’ble Supreme Court in case of State of
Tamil Nadu v. Adhiyaman Education & Research Institute
(supra) has held that the expression ‘coordination’ used in
Entry 66 of the Union List does not merely mean evaluation. It
would include power to do all things which are necessary to
prevent what would make ‘coordination’ either impossible or
difficult.
65. The question that arises for consideration of this
Court is whether there is any inconsistency or conflict between
the MEPS Act and the AICTE Regulation insofar as the age
of superannuation is concerned. Under the provisions of the
MEPS Act, the age of superannuation is 58. On the other
hand, the provisions of AICTE Regulation prescribes the age
of superannuation as 65.
66. This Court in case of Amrutraj Pratapji Vyas and
Ors. (supra) after considering the provisions of MEPS Act
and AICTE Act held that till 1990, all Polytechnics were not
within the ambit of MEPS Act. Thereafter, the AICTE was
responsible to prescribe the pay scales and other service
conditions of the teaching as well as non-teaching staff in
technical institutions like the Polytechnics and degree courses.
Various resolutions were passed by the State Government
adopting the recommendations made by the AICTE regarding
the qualifications and the pay scales. This Court also
considered that under section 4(1) of the MEPS Act, the State
Government is empowered to make rules providing for the
minimum      qualifications    for   recruitment,    duties,  pay,
allowances, post retirement and other benefits and other
conditions of service of employees of private schools. bdp 30
wp-3125.20 & ors(j).doc
67. This Court also held that AICTE being a body
created under the AICTE Act, is required to carry out
statutory functions and it is a model agency so far as the
technical education in India is concerned and is thus
responsible    to   issue    directions/   instructions    to  the
Management whether aided or unaided in view of the
provisions of section 4(3) of the M.E.P.S. Act, read with
section 3(1) of the said M.E.P.S. Act. It is held that the
polytechnic was not only bound to comply with the directions
issued under the provisions of MEPS Act and the MEPS
Rules framed thereunder, but, were also bound to comply with
the directions issued by the AICTE under the provisions of
AICTE Act including the directions issued for payment of pay
scale and other service conditions prescribed in respect of the
staff in a Polytechnic college or schools. The principles laid
down by this Court in case of Amrutraj Pratapji Vyas and Ors.
(supra) squarely applies to the facts of this case. We do not
propose to take any different view in the matter.
68. In our view, since there is conflict between the
provisions of the MEPS Act and the AICTE Regulations in
respect of the age of superannuation, the provisions of the
AICTE Regulations would prevail. The resolutions passed by
the State Government under the provisions of the AICTE
Regulations prescribing the age of superannuation would
apply to the teaching and non-teaching staff appointed by the
polytechnic institutes governed by the provisions of the AICTE
Act and Regulations. In our view, Mr.Anturkar, learned
senior counsel for the petitioners is right in his submission
that the provisions of the MEPS Act and of the AICTE
Regulations cannot be read harmoniously and thus there
being a conflict insofar as the age of superannuation is
concerned, the provisions of the AICTE Regulations or the
resolutions and/or the circulars issued under the provisions of
the AICTE Act or the Regulations would prevail and not the
bdp 31 wp-3125.20 & ors(j).doc age of superannuation
prescribed under the provisions of the MEPS Act read with
72. In our view, though the MEPS Act has received
the assent of the President on 16th March, 1978 and AICTE
Act had received the assent of the President 23rd December,
2010 and in ordinary course, the MEPS Act would bdp 32 wp-
3125.20 & ors(j).doc have prevailed over any other Central
Act, having received the assent of the President, however in
view of the proviso to Article 254(2) of the Constitution of
India, nothing prevents Parliament from enacting at any time
any law with respect to the same matter including a law
adding to, amending, varying or repealing the law so made by
the Legislature of the State.
73. The Hon’ble Supreme Court in case of T. Barai
v/s. Henry AH Hoe and another (supra) has held that the
proviso to Article 254(2) empowers the Union Parliament to
repeal or amend a repugnant State law even though it has
become valid by virtue of the President’s assent. Parliament
may repeal or amend the repugnant State law, either directly,
or by itself enacting a law repugnant to the State law with
respect to the ‘same matter’. It is held that even though the
subsequent law made by Parliament does not expressly repeal
a State law, even then, the State law will become void as soon
as the subsequent law of Parliament creating repugnancy is
made. A State law would be repugnant to the Union law when
there is direct conflict between the two laws. Such repugnancy
may also arise where both laws operate in the same field and
the two cannot possibly stand together.
74. In our view, the MEPS Act has to the extent that it
provides for the age of superannuation has become void as
soon as the AICTE Act creating the repugnancy was enacted.
Such repugnancy arises since both law operates in the same
field and cannot stand together.
85. In our view, the age of superannuation of the
petitioners in each of these petitions would be 60 years and not
58 years. We, accordingly pass the following order:
(a) Writ Petition No. 3125 of 2020 is made absolute in
terms of prayer clauses (a) to (d). Rule is made absolute
accordingly.
(b) Writ Petition No. 3617 of 2020 is made absolute in
terms of prayer clauses (B) and (C). Rule is made absolute
accordingly.
(c) In view of the disposal of the Writ Petition No.
3617 of 2020, Interim Application (St) No.93900 of 2020 does
not survive and is accordingly disposed of.
(d) There shall be no order as to costs.
(e) The parties to act on the authenticated copy of this
judgment.”
6. According to the learned counsel, the above ruling of the Bombay High
Court is answer to the lis in this case and there cannot be any doubt about the
mandatory nature of AICTE regulations and any contrary condition against the
regulation would have to be discountenanced as being legally unsustainable.
7. Heard Mr.Karthik Rajan for the petitioners, Ms.N.Mala for respondents 1
and 4, and Ms.AL.Ganthimathi, for the 5th respondent (AICTE), the newly
impleaded respondent.
8. After adverting to the contentions/submissions of the parties, perusing
the materials and the case laws cited, the nucleus of consideration is pivoted on
one point issue, as to whether the prescription of age of superannuation by
AICTE Regulations, 2019 is to be mandatorily applied to the third respondent
University or is it open to the University to prescribe its own age of
superannuation for its teaching staff?
9. If this Court were to hold that AICTE regulations are mandatory
consideration of the other subaltern contentions that the regulation ought to be
specifically adopted and the scheme as such must also be adopted in its entirety
for its application would become trifle consequence and otiose.
10. In the run-up to the conclusion on the basis of the above framework
of consideration, it is relevant to refer to the position of the third respondent
University before it became a University. In 1984, the Pondicherry Engineering
College was established. It was an autonomous institution fully funded by the
Government of Puducherry. It was a technical institution governed by the AICTE
regulations. However, an Act was passed in 2019 called, “Puducherry
Technological University Act, 2019”, (Act 4 of 2020) dated 31.03.2020, providing
for reconstitution of Puducherry Engineering College as a Technological
University. The Act came into force on 05.09.2020.
11. According to Section 5(4) of the Act of 2020, the service conditions as
enjoyed by them in their employment under the Pondicherry Engineering College
was to be protected. Section 5(4) reads as under:
“5. On and from the commencement of this Act,-
(4) Every person duly employed by the Pondicherry
Engineering College before the commencement of the Act,
shall hold his office or service in the University by the same
tenure, at the same remuneration and upon the same terms
and conditions, and with the same rights and privileges, as to
the pension, leave and gratuity, provident fund and other
matters, as he/she would have held the same, if, this Act had
not been passed, and shall continue to do so unless and until
his/ her employment is terminated by due process of law or
he/she has opted for the University's terms and conditions of
employment as prescribed in the Statutes.”
12. The above saving clause has protected the conditions of service,
rights and privileges etc. from being varied to their detriment, after
transformation of the college into a University under Act 4 of 2020. Therefore,
the petitioners' service conditions continued to be governed by AICTE
regulations, even after their services were continued under the University. In the
light of the said position, is it still open to the University to adopt a stand that
AICTE regulations, particularly with reference to prescription of the age of
superannuation, is not applicable, is to be examined by this Court, as part of its
judicial discourse. Further, de hors the saving clause, viz., Section 5(4) of Act 4
of 2020, if this Court were to ultimately hold that the third respondent is
mandatorily governed by AICTE regulations even otherwise, consideration of the
above issue may become eventually immaterial and nugatory.
13. This Court, in consideration of the kernel of the lis in this case, has to
first refer to the contentions of the learned counsel for respondent University in
order to examine whether the opposition to the claim of the petitioners is strong
and valid enough to refuse relief to them. The preferential reference to the
University's objection first, before considering the claim of the petitioners is
because of the fact that almost cast iron case has been put-forth on behalf of
the petitioners as to the peremptory nature of application of the AICTE
regulations, across the spectrum.
14. The primal contention raised on behalf of the University is with
reference to regulation 2.11, which has been extracted supra. Her focal
contention is on sub-Clause (f) of the regulation, which is here again extracted
for clearer understanding and demystifying the hallowness of the stand of the
“f) Payment of Central assistance for implementing
this Scheme is also subject to the condition that the entire
Scheme of revision of pay scales together with all the
conditions laid down by the AICTE by way of Regulations and
other guidelines shall be implemented by State / UT
Governments and technical institutions coming under their
jurisdiction as a composite scheme.”
15. The learned counsel for the University strongly and entirely premised
her arguments on the above sub-clause, contending that unless the University
has chosen to implement the entire scheme (composite scheme), various
regulations as provided in AICTE regulations, 2019, including regulation 2.12,
prescribing the age of superannuation, would not be applicable, automatically.
According to the learned counsel, the University has taken a decision not to seek
financial assistance from Government of India towards payment of arrears from
01.01.2016 to 31.03.2019 as a consequence of the revision of pay scales (VII Pay
Commission). Therefore, the question of applicability of age prescription by
AICTE regulation in terms of regulation 2.12 did not arise at all.
16. According to her, the teaching staff of the University were not paid
arrears from 01.01.2016 in the first place, nor the University had taken away
financial assistance from the Central Government in that regard. The adoption of
VII Central Pay Commission scale of pay was only notionally effected from
01.01.2016 and the actual arrears came to be paid to the teaching staff only
from 01.08.2019. The substance of the arguments is that not opting out of
availing central assistance in terms of regulation 2.11 as per sub-clause (f), the
University concisely did not adopt the earlier scheme and hence concomitantly,
the University was not bound by the other regulations of AICTE, interpreting
regulation 2.12 prescribing age of superannuation.
17. The above contention of the learned counsel may appear to be having
some force on a precipitative understanding, but when the same is critically and
incisively examined, the counter arguments put-forth on behalf of the petitioners
by the learned counsel, would be a clincher for rejecting the contention of the
University in this regard. As rightly contended by the learned counsel for the
petitioner, the clauses as contained in regulation 2.11 have to be read in the
context of clause 1.3 of the regulation. Clause 1.3 of regulation deals with the
effective date of revised pay scales from 01.01.2016. Both the provisions if
conjointly read, the implementation of the AICTE scheme which is referred to in
sub-clause (f), as extracted above, is to be confined only with reference to
payment of arrears of revised pay scales from 01.01.2016. Sub-clause (f) is
nothing but an off-shoot provision incorporated under the caption, “Financial
Assistance from Government of India for implementation of 7th CPC Scale”
(Regulation 2.11). Such stipulation in the said sub-clause cannot be stretched
beyond the contours of the main regulation 2.11. Therefore, the argument put-
forth on behalf of the University is deeply flawed, legally unacceptable and has
18. The legal position further becomes pellucid and translucently clear if a
reference could be made to regulation 1.2 and 2.12, which are extracted herein.
“1.2 Categories of Institutions to whom the regulations apply
These shall apply to all degree level technical
institutions  and    universities  including  deemed     to  be
universities imparting technical education and such other
courses / programs approved by AICTE and areas as notified
by the council from time to time.
The age of superannuation of all faculty members and
Principals / Directors of institutions shall be 65 years. An
extension of 5 years (till the attainment of 70 years of age)
may be given to those faculty members who are physically fit,
have written technical books, published papers and has
average 360o feedback of more than 8 out of 10 indicating
them being active during last 3 preceding years of service.”
19. The above two regulations in no uncertain terms use peremptory
expressions that the regulations shall apply to all degree level technical
institutions and Universities and the age of superannuation shall apply to all
faculty members/ Principals/Directors etc. In the teeth of the mandatory nature
of expression as found in the above clause, it does not lie in the mouth of the
University to contend that it has an option to adopt the regulation, or it can
choose to ignore it. In fact, the learned Judge of this Court in W.P.No.10049 of
2004 dated 26.11.2009 has held that such intransigent stand by any institution
or University against applicability of AICTE regulation ought to be discouraged
and condemned.
20. The learned counsel for the University in support of her contention
that unless the AICTE regulations are specifically adopted by the University, the
same cannot said to be applicable automatically, has referred to relevant
paragraphs 58 to 65 in the case of Jagdish Prasad Sharma, which have been
extracted supra. In that case, the Hon'ble Supreme Court was dealing with the
fact situation that UGC has introduced a scheme for its implementation by the
Universities coming under the States' control. Primarily, UGC regulations were
applicable to the Centrally funded educational institutions and in the regulations,
an option was provided, in adoption of the scheme of UGC, on fulfillment of
certain conditions by the States. In that context, the Hon'ble Supreme Court has
held that their being no compulsion, to accept or adopt the scheme, the States
are free to decide as to whether the scheme would be adopted by them or not.
The Hon'ble Supreme Court went on to hold that there cannot be an automatic
application of the recommendations made by the Commission, without any
conscious decision being taken by the States in this regard.
21. With regard to the above observation of the Hon'ble Supreme Court
reference could be made to the UGC communication dated 23.03.2007 in respect
of enhancement of age of superannuation from 62 to 65 years for teaching
position. The enhancement was particularly confined to centrally funded higher
technical educational institutions. The UGC regulations therefore provided a lee-
way to the States to either adopt or not to adopt. Such latitude is not provided in
AICTE regulations as held by the Courts, which would be briefly referred to
hereunder.
22. The learned counsel for the petitioner referred to two relevant
judgments one of the Punjab and Haryana High Court and another of Karnataka
High Court. The Courts' observations and rulings have also been extracted supra.
In the case of Dr.Jogender Pal Singh, the High Court of Punjab and Haryana
has clearly held that in case of conflict between the Central Act and the State
laws, AICTE regulations would prevail over the State laws and the High Court
has also held that the age of faculty members shall be 65 years. Such
prescription was also held to be binding upon college/institution covered under
the AICTE regulations. That was a case where the High Court was dealing with
the Union Territories Act vis-a-vis AICTE regulations.
23. In regard to the decision of the Karnataka High Court in
Dr.G.R.Bharat Sai Kumar, the same legal position has been affirmed. The
Karnataka High Court has clearly distinguished between UGC and AICTE
regulations and stated that as far as UGC regulations were concerned, it was not
mandatory, whereas AICTE regulation was mandatory in nature and the same
does not leave any discretion or option for any individual institution or University
governed by the regulation to have different service conditions for its staff in
contravention of the regulations. The above decision of the Karnataka High
Court is answer to the contention of the learned counsel for the University that
analogy drawn by them as between AICTE and UGC regulations is misplaced and
fundamentally erroneous.
24. The learned counsel for AICTE has also pointedly referred to the
decision of the Bombay High Court reported in Lalit Rajendra Gajanan. The
relevant ruling of the Court has also been extracted supra. In that case also, the
Bombay High Court was considering a conflict between the State Legislature
MEPS Act and AICTE regulation, particularly in respect of age of superannuation.
It categorically held that the provisions of AICTE regulation would prevail. This
decision has been cited by none other than AICTE itself, in order to bolster their
unequivocal stand as disclosed in their counter-affidavit, stating that their
regulations are binding on all institutions/ University governed by AICTE.
25. In respect of the larger issue, as to whether in case of conflict
between State laws and the Central enactments, two references have been
drawn by the learned counsel for the petitioner. The earlier reference was made
to a decision of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Adhiyaman
Educational & Research Institute and Ors. . The final ruling of the Court as
contained in paragraph 41 of the judgment has been extracted supra. The Court
has held that to the extent the State legislation is in conflict with the Central
legislation, the same would be void and inoperative. The Court was interpreting
Entry 66 of the Union List vis-a-viz Entry 25 of the Concurrent List of the Seventh
Schedule to the Constitution of India.
26. The second reference is to the Division Bench of this Court wherein
also, the settled legal position in terms of the constitutional scheme has been
reinforced in the case reported in V.Lekha. The relevant observation of the
Division Bench has been extracted supra wherein also it has been held that the
State law will have to give way to the Central enactment to the extent of
repugnancy. To state the obvious is a trite proposition, nevertheless it has to be
reaffirmed and re-enforced with a view to repulse the argument put-forth on
behalf of the University.
27. In the teeth of the mandatory nature of AICTE regulation and also the
decision of the Courts which have clearly and categorically clarified the legal
position as to the mandatory nature of the AICTE regulations, yet the stand
adopted by the third respondent University that unless the regulations are
specifically adopted by the University, the same cannot have automatic
application is nothing but advancing a specious case on behalf of the university.
In the opinion of this Court, the university appears to be blissfully oblivious to
the constitutional scheme and also various case laws which have consistently
held that the AICTE regulations are mandatory in nature. The warped
interpretation of regulation 2.11 by the University to wriggle out of its legal
obligation in regard to the prescription of age of superannuation, is to be
discountenanced as being downrightly vexatious.
28. For all the above stated reasons, this Court is of the considered view
that the age of superannuation as prescribed under regulation 2.12 is binding on
the third respondent University and any other prescription of age of
superannuation repugnant to the AICTE regulation is to be held void and
inoperative and it cannot be enforced in law.
29. The trajectory of the above judicial discourse would only lead to an
inexorable conclusion that these petitioners have made out a peremptory case
30. In the said circumstances, there will be a direction to the third
respondent University to reinstate the petitioners in service forthwith and
continue them in service till they attain the age of 65 years, as prescribed by
AICTE regulations, 2019.
31. The third respondent University is directed to pass appropriate orders
reinstating the petitioners with effect from the respective dates the petitioners
were retired from service, along with consequential benefits, including all pay
and allowances for the period when the petitioners had been kept out of
employment, illegally, within a period of four weeks from the date of receipt of a
copy of this order.
32. In the result, the writ petitions are allowed. There will be no order as
to costs. Consequently, W.M.P.Nos.19128 and 19143 of 2021 are closed.
