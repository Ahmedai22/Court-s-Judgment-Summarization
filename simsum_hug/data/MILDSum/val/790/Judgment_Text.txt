The criminal original petition has been filed to direct the learned
Judicial Magistrate, Bodinayakanur, Theni District to run the sentences
passed in C.C.No.477 of 2018 concurrently along with the sentence passed in
C.C.No.02 of 2019, dated 21.01.2019.
2.The petitioner was involved in two different cases on two different
occasions. One case was registered on the file of the first respondent for the
offences under Sections 457 and 380 of IPC and after completion of
investigation, charge sheet had been filed and the same taken cognizance in
C.C.No.477 of 2018, on file of the learned Judicial Magistrate,
Bodinayakanur. Then, he was also involved in another case, for which, FIR
had been registered for the offences under Section 454 and 380 of IPC on the
file of the second respondent and culminated into C.C.No.2 of 2019. In both
the cases, the petitioner was convicted and sentenced by the judgment, dated
21.01.2019 in C.C.No.2 of 2019, in which, he was sentenced to undergo three
years imprisonment.          Subsequently, the petitioner was also convicted in
C.C.No.477 of 2018, dated 25.01.2019 on the file of the very same learned
Judicial Magistrate and sentenced to undergo three years imprisonment. The
petitioner had already undergone a period of ten days of remand and he has
been in prison from 27.09.2018 till today. However, the learned Judicial
Magistrate,          Bodinayakanur,     while    sentencing   him   for       three     years
imprisonment.
3. In this regard it is relevant to rely upon the judgment of the Division
Bench of this Court reported in                   208-2-LW(Crl)773 in the case of
Selvakumar Vs. The Inspector of Police, Seidhunganallur Police Station
“11.The scope of Section 427(2) of Cr.P.C. is that in
respect of the convict undergoing imprisonment for life,
the sentence of the imprisonment passed on subsequent
conviction shall run concurrently. The reason being that
the sentence for life must be understood to mean as the
sentence      to    serve     remainder     of    life        in
http://www.judis.nic.in prison unless commuted or
remitted by the appropriate authority and the person
having only one life span, the sentence on the subsequent
conviction of imprisonment for a term of imprisonment
for life can only be superimposed the earlier life sentence
and certainly not added to it.
12.A Division Bench of this Court had an occasion
to consider a case of similar nature in K. Arasan and
others Vs. The State of Tamil Nadu, reported in
MANU/TN/1953/2012 : 2012 (6) CTC 510. The relevant
portion of the judgment is extracted hereunder.
“2. The crux of the question involved in this matter
is that whether this Court can invoke the inherent powers
under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure
[hereinafter referred to as “Cr.P.C”] for granting the
relief under Section 427, Cr.P.C, for ordering the
sentence imposed in the former case to run concurrently
along with the sentence of imprisonment awarded in the
latter case. 3. It is seen that two conflicting views
expressed by two learned Single Judges in respect of
invoking the jurisdiction under Section 482, Cr.P.C for
granting the relief of ordering the subsequent sentence to
run concurrently with the previous sentence awarded
against a person in an earlier case which necessitated
the learned referring Single Judge to refer the matter to a
Division Bench to resolve the said conflict between two
decisions. It is seen that a learned Single Judge in A.
Palanisamy @ Kaithan v. Inspector of Police, B1 Police
555 : 2011 (4) MLJ (Crl.) 813, after referring to various
judgments of the Hon'ble Apex Court, has held in
paragraph 27, as here-under. 27. In the instant case on
hand also, the provision of Section 427, Cr.P.C was not
invoked either in the original cases or in the Appeals.
Under      the    above     said    circumstances, Section
427, Cr.P.C cannot be applied in a separate and
independent proceedings by this Court in exercising the
inherent jurisdiction under Section 482, Cr.P.C.
4. Another learned Single Judge in A. Paulraj v.
Maria Chellammal, 2011 (4) MLJ (Crl.) 798, has taken a
contrary view by placing reliance on the decision of the
http://www.judis.nic.in Larger Bench of the Hon'ble Apex
“26. Since the Larger Bench of the Supreme Court
in State of Punjab v. Madhan Lal [supra] had considered
on Application filed, under Section 482, Cr.P.C the
decision rendered in M.S Kudva v. State of Andhra
Pradesh [supra] may not be applicable and invoking
jurisdiction under Section 482, Cr.P.C is indeed available
to the Petitioner.”
5. We have gone through the above two conflicting
decisions rendered by the two learned Single Judges.
13.0. It is pertinent to refer the following decisions
rendered by the other High Courts in respect of the issue
involved in this matter. 13.1. A Division Bench of the
Andhra Pradesh High Court in V. Venkateswarlu v. State
of A.P, 1987 Cri.L.J 1621, has held as here under:
“10. The High Court, while exercising its
Revisional jurisdiction suo motu or in exercise of its
inherent power under Section 482, can direct the
sentences to run concurrently as provided under Section
427, Cr.P.C, even though the convictions and sentences
that have been passed by the Additional Sessions Judges
of different Sessions Divisions have become final.” 13.2.
A Full Bench of Madhya Pradesh High Court
in Shersingh v. State of M.P, 1989 Cri.LJ 632 [1] has
“Inherent powers of the High Court can be invoked
under Section 482 even if the Trial Court or the appellate
or Revisional Court has not exercised its discretion
under Section 427(1) of the Code in directing running of
previous and subsequent sentences concurrently. The
inherent powers of the High Court is not in any way
fettered by the provisions of Section 427(1) and it can be
invoked at any stage even if there is no such order passed
under Section 427(1) by the Trial Court or Appellate or
Revisional http://www.judis.nic.in Court and even though
the conviction has become final.” 13.3. The view taken by
the Division Bench of the Andhra Pradesh High Court
and the Full Bench of the Madhya Pradesh High Court
are in line with the view taken by the Larger Bench of the
Hon'ble Apex Court in State of Punjab v. Madhan Lal,
2009 (5) SCC 238. As a matter of fact, as already pointed
out, the learned Single Judge of this Court in A. Paulraj
v. Maria Chellammal, 2011 (4) MLJ (Crl.) 798, also
referred the decision of the Hon'ble Apex Court in M.R
Kudva v. State of Andhra Pradesh, 2007 (2) SCC 772
(Two-Judge Bench) and preferred to place reliance on the
decision rendered by the Larger Bench consisting of
Three Judges of the Hon'ble Apex Court.
14.0. At this juncture, it is relevant to refer the
following decisions of the Hon'ble Apex Court:
14.1. In Union of India v. K.S Subramanian, AIR
1976 SC 2433, the Hon'ble Apex Court has held as
‘The proper course for a High Court is to try to
find out and follow the opinions expressed by Larger
Benches of the Supreme Court in preference to those
expressed by smaller Benches of the Court. That is the
practice followed by the Supreme Court itself. The
practice has not crystallized into a rule of law declared
by the Supreme Court. If however, the High Court is of
the opinion that the views expressed by Larger Benches
of the Supreme Court are not applicable to the facts of
the case it should say so giving reasons supporting its
point of view.” 14.2 The Hon'ble Apex Court in State of
Uttar Pradesh v. Ram Chandra, AIR 1976 SC 2547, has
“Constitutional position as regards the powers of
Court to go behind the orders of termination to find out
http://www.judis.nic.in in cases where a High Court finds
any conflict between the views expressed by larger and
smaller Benches of this Court, it cannot be disregard or
skirt the views expressed by the Larger Benches.
The proper course for a High Court in such a case
is to try to find out and follow the opinion expressed by
Larger Benches of the Supreme Court in preference to
those expressed by smaller benches of the Court which
practice, hardened as it has into a rule of law, is followed
by the Supreme Court itself.” The above decisions
rendered by the Hon'ble Apex Court make it crystal clear
that the High Court has to follow the opinion expressed
by the Larger Benches of the Hon'ble Apex Court in
preference to those expressed by smaller Benches. 15. As
far as the issue involved in this matter, we are of the
considered view that the learned Single Judge in A.
Paulraj v. Maria Chellammal, 2011 (4) MLJ (Crl.) 798,
has rightly placed reliance on the decision of the Larger
Bench consisting of Three Judges of the Hon'ble Apex
Court in State of Punjab v. Madhan Lal, 2009 (5) SCC
238, which is binding on this Court and taken a correct
view. 16. It is to be stated that invoking the jurisdiction
under Section 482, Cr.P.C in order to grant the relief
under Section 427, Cr.P.C would not amount to altering,
varying or modifying the findings of the Trial Court or
Appellate Court. On the other hand, it is always open to
this Court to exercise power under Section 482, Cr.P.C to
secure the ends of justice. It is needless to say that this
Court has to exercise its judicial discretion for invoking
the power under Section 482, Cr.P.C for granting the
relief under Section 427, Cr.P.C, on the basis of the facts
and circumstances and gravity of the charge levelled
against the Accused in each case. 17. In the result, we are
answering the reference to the effect that the inherent
power of the High Court under Section 482, Cr.P.C, can
very well be extended to issue a direction ordering the
sentence imposed in a latter case on conviction to run
concurrently with the sentence imposed in a former case
as       provided          under Section      427, Cr.P.C.”
http://www.judis.nic.in 6. In the case, on hand, it is seen
that the petitioner was involved in two cases only viz.,
C.C.No.22 of 2017 and C.C.No.23 of 2017. The
petitioner is not an habitual offender and he did not
commit any other offences, similar to those cases.
Further it is also seen that the learned Judicial
Magistrate, Sathiyamangalam sentenced him to undergo
imprisonment for a period of two years for both
sentences viz., offences under Sections 454 and 380 of
IPC to run concurrently. The High Court of
Bombay(Nagpur Bench) held as follows:
13. We are fortified in this view as per the
judgment in case of Abidkhan @ Salman Mukhtar Khan
Pathan vs. State of Maharashtra, reported in
which Justice Shukre authored the Judgment). Three
cases were tried and convicted by one Court.
(Metropolitan Magistrate), whereas in case before us,
two different Magistrate Courts (from two places) tried
and convicted these petitioners. This is the oly
distinguishable factor. Otherwise, the observation made
therein are perfectly applicable to the case before us.
14. We are also fortified in taking this view on the
basis of judgment delivered by Hon'ble Supreme Court.
In case of Benson vs. State of Kerala, reported in
Supreme converted the sentence into concurrent
sentences. There were almost 11 cases.
15. It is true that Bhandara Court and Tumsar may
or may not be aware of cases pending in two different
Courts. But, it is certain that both these Courts are fully
aware of cases dealt with by them. Can we say that these
two courts are unaware about legal provisions contained
in Section 427 of Cr.P.C. These two Courts have not given
them the benefit of concurrent theory of sentences. These
two Courts are fully aware about the provisions of
Probatiion of Offenders Act and they have
http://www.judis.nic.in denied the benefit to the
petitioners.
16. Ultimately, the Judicial Officers dealing with
the case is also having human element on it. So, while
convicting the petitioners, they must be having “repetitive
tendency of these petitioners while committing these
offences” in their mind. They were fully justified in
denying them benefits of concurrent theory. The theory of
deterrence must have weighed with their mind. But what
we feel is that the trial Courts are unaware of these
provisions of law. We say so because there is no
discussion on this issue. Judge may consciously deny
benefit. But, it must be reflected from the judgment. In
case of Abidkhan, there was direction to place the matter
before Registrar General. In order to sensitize the judges
in the State of Maharastra, we feel some more needs to be
done. Hence, we intend to direct the Registrar (Judicial)
to circulate this judgment amongst all Judges in State of
Maharashtra. We hope the Judges of trial Court and the
appellate Court will consider the provisions of Section
427 of Cr.P.C. while dealing with the issue of sentence.
Ultimately, it is the discretion of the concerned Judge
whether to grant him benefit or not. It depends upon facts
of each case. But it should not happened that due to
ignorance of this provisions of law, a rightful convict may
be denied benefit of this provision of law.
4.In view of the above judgments, the scope of Section 427 of Cr.P.C. is
that, in respect of conviction to undergo the sentence of imprisonment passed
on subsequent cases for the offence of same nature shall go concurrently. It is
also clear that this Court can exercise its jurisdiction under Section 482 of
Cr.P.C and issue direction that the sentence imposed by the trial Court to run
concurrently.
5.In the case on hand, the petitioner was convicted and sentenced in
two cases by the same Court in C.C.Nos.477 of 2018 by order dated
25.01.2019 and in C.C.No.2 of 2019, dated 21.09.2019.
6.In view of the above, this Court is of the considered opinion that the
sentences imposed on the petitioner in both the cases shall be run
concurrently. Accordingly, the criminal original petition is allowed.
