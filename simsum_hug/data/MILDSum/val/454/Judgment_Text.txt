The petitioner namely Rajlakshmi foundation has filed the
present petition in the nature of Public Interest Litigation (PIL)
highlighting the inaction of the Child Welfare Committee (in
short 'CWC') in protecting and restoring the basic rights of
children under the provisions of Juvenile Justice (Care and
Protection of Children) Act, 2015 (which shall be referred
hereinafter as JJ Act) especially under section 2(14) of the JJ
Act. According to the petitioner, the CWC is not properly
exercising its power in granting visitation rights to the children
who are in need of care and protection as defined under section
2(14) of the JJ Act with the non-custodial parent thereby
violating the fundamental right of the child under the Article 21
of the Constitution of India.
The petitioner is claiming it to be a non-governmental
organization and working for various social causes for the last
two years. Except for the certificate, nothing has been brought
on record to demonstrate that petitioner's organization is
working for various social causes related to the public interest.
Not a single antecedent has been mentioned in the relevant part
of the writ petition. The petitioner has not disclosed the status
of its member and the nature of their activity. The by-laws of
the foundations are not on record. However, the petitioner is
mainly aggrieved by the judgment passed by a single bench of
this court in writ petition no.6163/2016 (Priya Yadav Vs. the
State of M.P. And others) dated 23.11.2016 whereby it has been
held that CWC does not confer power to give custody of child
taking it from mother and give to father in the manner as done
by the CWC, Indore. A note of caution has been issued that
such power should not be exercised by other CWCs functioning
in the State of M.P. The court has directed to circulate the order
to all the CWCs of the State of M.P. directing them that
visitation rights and custody as guardians should not be invoked
by them assuming the jurisdiction in this regard. The para-14 of
the above-mentioned judgment is reproduced below:-
14. In view of the discussions made hereinabove, it
can safely be concluded that under the provisions of Juvenile
Justice(Care and Protection of Children) Act,2015 and
Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Rules,
2016, the Child Welfare Committee does not confer power to
give custody of a child taking it from mother and give to the
father in the manner as done by the CWC, Indore in the
present case. It is seen that CWC, Indore is passing orders
granting custody of the children and one such order has been
brought to the notice of this court dated 25.5.2015. In the
said case also the proceedings were pending before the
Family Court for custody of the child but CWC usurp the
jurisdiction and during the pendency of those proceedings
directed custody of the child to the mother. Similar is the
position in the present case wherein also as per Annx.P/2, an
application for custody of the child has also been filed before
the Family Court but during pendency of the said
application, respondent No.5 applied to the CWC where on
the order of the visitation right has been passed directing to
bring the child in the office of CWC, Indore on every Friday
between 10.00 am to 5.00 pm to the petitioner. In my
considered opinion the aforesaid exercise of powers by the
CWC, Indore is not in conformity with the Act and the Rules
and also contrary to the powers conferred under the other
law applicable for the time being in force, therefore the order
impugned is set aside.
According to the petitioner, the aforesaid judgment is
contrary to the earlier judgment passed by another court in writ
petition no.2502/2018 dated 19.02.2018 in which it has been
held that section 40 of the JJ Act clearly provides that custody
can be handed over after determining the suitability of a person
to take care of the child and the committee has also been
empowered to give suitable direction in this regard. The
petitioner has also placed reliance on the judgment passed by
the Apex Court in W.P.(Crl.) No.102/2007 Re-Exploitation Of
Union of India and others 2017 (7) SCC 578. According to the
petitioner, the procedure in the family court is lengthy and
complex and it takes more than a year to decide the custody of
the child therefore, the power should be conferred to the CWC
to entertain the disputes between the parties in respect of
custody of the child. The petitioner has placed reliance over
Article 2(2), 5, 7, 1, 8, 9 and 18 of the United Nations
Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC) and sought
the relief that a writ in the nature of mandamus be issued
directing CWC to deal with the matter of child right as per the
After notice respondents nos.1 and 2 have filed the return
submitting that by way of the petition the petitioner is virtually
seeking transfer of power of the family court or court of law to
the CWC but such relief cannot be granted in a writ petition in
the light of the judgment passed by this Court in WP
No.6163/2016       decided   on     23.11.2016.  The    issue   of
guardianship with respect to the Hindus be only be decided
under the provisions of the Hindu Minority and Guardianship
Act,1956 and under the said Act the CWC is not the competent
court to act upon. The order passed in the writ petition
no.6163/2016 has been affirmed in writ appeal no.284/2017
hence, CWC cannot be allowed to supersede the power of court
and the petition is misconceived and is liable to be dismissed.
(N.C.P.C.R.) has also filed the return submitting that the Family
Court Act, 1984 and Guardian and Wards Act 1890 clearly
states the power to grant custody of child by way of order and
decree passed by the family court. Section 40 of the JJ Act
explicitly states that the custody of a child can be handed over
after actual determination of the suitability of a person to take
due and proper care of the child. N.C.P.C.R. is a statutory body
working for the protection and promotion of child rights. It is
further submitted by respondent no.4 that N.C.P.C.R. is only a
review and re-commendatory body which can only review the
provisions prescribed under the law and make relevant
recommendations and suggestions to the government.             The
commission cannot step into the domain of the family court.
In view of the returns filed by the respondents, the
petitioner is also not getting support from N.C.P.C.R. By this
petition the petitioner is virtually seeking that the order passed
by this Court in writ petition no.6163/2016 Priya Yadav(supra)
be not implemented and that amounts to setting aside the said
order whereas the coordinate Division Bench of this court has
already declined to interfere with the order, therefore, this court
cannot again examine the validity of the judgment and set aside
it. This court in the case of Priya Yadav (supra) after
considering all the provisions of law especially JJ Act, Family
Court Act, Hindu Minority and Guardianship Act,1956 has held
that the CWC cannot act as a Family Court in respect of
custody of the child. The power authority and power lie with
the Family Court under the statutes therefore, this petition is
nothing but a misuse of the process of law.
Accordingly, this writ petition is dismissed with a cost of
Rs 10,000.00 which shall be deposited in the High court Bar
