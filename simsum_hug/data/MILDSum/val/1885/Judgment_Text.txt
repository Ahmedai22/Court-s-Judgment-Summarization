For Petitioner(s)        :  Mr. J.S. Bhaleria, through VC
For Respondent(s)        :  Mr. R.D. Bhadu, through VC
1.    This writ petition has been filed by the petitioner being
aggrieved with the action of the respondent No.2 – Sub Divisional
Magistrate, Nohar, District Hanumangarh and respondent No.3 -
Tehsildar Nohar, District Hanumangarh of not accepting her
application for issuance of a caste certificate in her favour
declaring that she is a member of Scheduled Caste.
2.    The case of the petitioner is that originally she was resident
of State of Haryana, where her caste Regar is categorized as SC.
It is contended that petitioner got married to Mr. Sanjay Kumar,
resident of Ward No.10, Tehsil Nohar, District Hanumangarh. The
husband of the petitioner is also a member of SC in the State of
Rajasthan. It is the case of the petitioner that earlier she was
declared as a Regar but now when she applied before the Sub-
Divisional Magistrate, Nohar, District Hanumangarh for issuance of
SC certificate in her favour, her application was not accepted on
the ground that she is not resident of State of Rajasthan and,
therefore, the caste certificate declaring her a member of Sc
cannot be issued.
3.    Learned counsel for the petitioner has submitted that the
action of the respondents of not accepting the application of the
petitioner for issuing a certificate in her favour declaring her a
member of SC is illegal and contrary to the law laid down by this
Court in various judgments.
4.    Learned counsel for the petitioner has placed reliance on the
decisions rendered by Division Bench of this Court at Jaipur Bench
in State of Rajasthan Vs. Smt. Manju Yadav(D.B. Special Appeal
(W) No.1116/2018)decided on 18.09.2018, by Single Judge at
Jodhpur in Jaspal Kaur Vs.State of Rajasthan and Ors. (SB Civil
Writ Petition No.1059/2020) decided on 28.01.2020 and by Single
Judge at Jaipur Bench in Santosh Vs. State of Rajasthan & Ors.(SB
Civil Writ Petition No.4713/2020) decided on 20.07.2020.
5.    Learned counsel appearing for the respondents is not ina
position to dispute the fact that the controversy involved in this
writ petition is squarely covered by the above referred decisions.
6.    Division Bench of this Court in the case of State of Rajasthan
Vs. Smt. Manju Yadav (supra) has held asunder:-
“4.   Females outside the State of Rajasthan on
migrating to Rajasthan, post marriage may not be
entitled   to  the  benefit of   reservation  in  public
employment in the State of Rajasthan on account of
being a member of a SC or ST or OBC in another
5.     But these ladies would certainly be entitled to be
issued a SC or ST or OBC certificate. For the reason,
apart from reservation in public employment these
certificates may be relevant for grant of some benefit.
For example, it may be a housing scheme. A migrant
lady may claim benefit on the strength of the
certificate  if  the   scheme    envisages    domicile   or
residence as the entitlement for a house or a flat with
reservation provided.
6.     Under the circumstances, we find no infirmity in
the directions issued by the learned Single Judge as to
what procedure needs to be followed for grant of an
OBC certificate applied for by a female who has
migrated, post marriage, to the State of Rajasthan.
We    make    it  clear  once   again.   Issue   of   public
employment and benefit of reservation has been
decided by the Supreme Court and thus our present
order would not be misconstrued as enabling anybody
to the benefit of reservation. The present order
concerns only to the issuance of a certificate applied
for.”
7.   This Court reiterated the above referred position of law in
Jaspal Kaur (supra) and Santosh (supra).
8.   So it is clear that the petitioner is not entitled for reservation
in public employment in the State of Rajasthan being the resident
of State of Punjab, however, she can get the other benefits as
being an SC on the strength of the certificate if the scheme
envisages domicile or residence as entitlement.
9.   In view of the above discussion, the writ petition is allowed.
The respondent No.2 Sub Divisional Magistrate, Nohar, District
Hanumangarh is directed to issue only a caste certificate to the
petitioner with clarification that this certificate is not for taking
benefit in public employment in the State of Rajasthan, within a
period of one week from the date of submission of certified copy
of this order.
10.   The stay application also stands disposed of accordingly.
