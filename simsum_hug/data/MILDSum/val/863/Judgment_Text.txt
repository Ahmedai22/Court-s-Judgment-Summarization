The original petition is filed to set aside the order in
I.A.No.3123/2018 in O.S.No.125/2018 (Ext.P3) of the
Court    of  the   2nd    Additional   Subordinate     Judge,
2. The petitioners were the defendants in the above
suit, filed by the respondent, seeking a decree for
realisation of money. The petitioners were set ex-parte.
They had filed I.A.No.3123/2018 to set aside the ex-parte
order. The Court below, by Ext.P2 order, set aside the
order on condition that the petitioners file their written
statement on or before 17.12.2018. Even though, the
petitioners had filed the written statement on the said
date there was a formal defect in the same. Therefore,
the   Court   below    by  the    impugned    Ext.P3    order,
dismissed I.A.No.3123/2018 and confirmed the ex-parte
order. Ext.P3 is erroneous. Hence, the original petition.
3. Heard; Sri.Biju Varghese Abraham, the learned
counsel appearing for the petitioners and Sri.Zakeer
Hussain,    the   learned   counsel  appearing  for    the
4. The Court below had by Ext.P2 order set aside
the ex-parte order on condition that the petitioners file
their written statement on or before 17.12.2018. It is
undisputed that the petitioners had filed their written
statement; but there was some formal defect in the
same. The Court below even after noticing that the
written statement was filed, rejected I.A.No.3123/2018
holding    that    no   written  statement   was    filed.
Consequentially, Ext.P3 order was passed, confirming
the ex-parte order.
5.  On   an    appreciation of  the pleadings    and
materials on record, I find that the course adopted by
the Court below to be hyper technical and unwarranted
especially when the petitioners had filed the written
statement within the prescribed time period permitted
by the Court below. The Court below ought to have
granted the petitioners an opportunity to cure defect in
the written statement, instead of taking the drastic step
of rejecting the application. It is trite, Courts should
make every endevour to dispose of a case on merits
rather than on default.
6. In the above background, I am inclined to
exercise the supervisory powers of this Court under
Article 227 of the Constitution of India and allow the
original petition in the following manner:
(i)     Ext.P3 order is set aside.
(ii)    The petitioners are permitted to cure the
defects in the written statement within two
weeks from the date of receipt of a certified
copy of this judgment, and represent the
written statement before the Court below.
(iii)   The Court below shall proceed with the trial of
the suit and dispose of the same, in accordance
with law, as expeditiously as possible and at
any rate on or before 31.03.2023.
