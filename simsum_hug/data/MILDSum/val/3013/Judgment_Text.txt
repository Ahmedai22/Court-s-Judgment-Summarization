1.          The appellants     have challenged the judgment and
order dated 10.8.2018 passed by the Additional Sessions Judge,
Mangaon, Raigad in Sessions Case No.27/2016. By the impugned
judgment and order, the appellants, who are the original accused
Nos.1 to 4, were convicted for commission of the offence
punishable under Section 395 of the Indian Penal Code and were
sentenced to suffer RI for ten years and to pay fine of Rs.50,000/-

2.          Heard    Shri   Aashish      Satpute,  learned     Advocate
appointed for the appellants and Smt. M.R. Tidke, learned APP for
3.          The prosecution case is that PW-1 Ravindra Lad and
PW-2 Ankit Dasure were the Supervisors of a Poultry Farm. They
had supplied chickens to their customers and had got money. They
were carrying amount of Rs.4 Lakhs. They were traveling on the
highway around midnight on 11.12.2015.          Suddenly they were
intercepted by the accused. One of the accused gave a blow by stick
because of which both of them fell down. The other accused joined
the first accused and they were assaulted with sticks.        The bag
containing more than Rs.4 Lakhs was taken away. The victims then
went to one Vilas Bait and informed the incident. All of them along
with others then went to Kolad Police Station. C.R. No.239/2015
was registered at Roha police station under Section 395 of IPC.
The investigation was carried out. All the appellants-accused were
arrested on 17.12.2015. Apart from the appellants, there was one
more offender who was below 18 years of age.           His trial was
separated. The investigation was carried out. During investigation,
it is the prosecution case that the appellants were identified in the
test identification parade held in the Tahsildar office at Roha on
18.1.2016. It is also the prosecution case that during investigation
some cash amount was recovered at the instance of different
appellants. The wives of the appellants produced some ornaments
which were purchased using the amount involved in this offence.
After this recovery, the investigation was continued. Statements of
witnesses were recorded and at the conclusion of the investigation,
charge-sheet was filed. The case was committed to the court of
Sessions. The appellants were the original accused Nos.1 to 4.
4.           During trial, the prosecution examined twelve witnesses
including two victims, the pancha for recovery, the Tahsildar who
had conducted the test identification parade and the investigating
officers. The defence of the appellants was of total denial. At the
conclusion of the trial, learned Judge believed the evidence of
identification parade and of recovery. He convicted and sentenced
the appellants as mentioned earlier.
5.           The evidence led by the prosecution in brief is as
(i)       PW-1 Ravindra Lad was the first informant.            He has
deposed that he was working as a Supervisor with Modern Poultry
at Chondhi, Taluka-Alibag. The business of that poultry farm was to
supply small chicks to poultries and after growth of those chicks
into chickens they were selling them to the traders and in this
process they used to earn profit.   The cash collected from the
traders used to be deposited in the company situated at Kihim,
Taluka-Alibag. On 10.10.2015, they sold their chickens to Aayan
Traders and Harshad Traders.      They paid Rs.2,65,000/- and
Rs.2,20,000/- respectively.  Thus, the first informant–PW.1 was
having amount of Rs.4,85,000/-.     He was accompanied by his
colleague Anikt Dasure (PW-2).      They were travelling on a
motorcycle bearing No.MH-06-BK-8525.      They were proceedings
towards Chondhi, Taluka-Alibag from Baitwadi. At around 1.00
a.m. on 11.12.2015, they had reached a spot near Dolvahal Electric
Project. The speed of their motorcycle was slightly slow because
they were on a turn. Suddenly one person rushed towards them
with a stick. He assaulted them by stick. PW-1 lost control of his
motorcycle and both of them fell down. In the meantime, four
more persons came on the spot with sticks. All the five persons
assaulted PWs-1 & 2 with sticks. They took away the bag forcibly
which was with PW-2 Ankit. Thus, they were robbed of the cash
amount of Rs.4,85,000/- and Ankit’s mobile handset of TATA
Indicom company.    PWs-1 & 2 went to Baitwadi by walk.            The
motorcycle was lying at the spot. According to PW-1 he had
suffered injury over his right arm and PW-2 had suffered injury
over his legs. They met Vilas Bait at Baitwadi. He was told about
the incident. Then he along with ten other persons accompanied
PWs-1 & 2 to Kolad police station. They lodged FIR. The FIR is
produced on record at Exhibit-21. The FIR was actually registered
at Roha police station at 6.30 a.m. on 11.12.2015. On 18.1.2016,
PWs-1 & 2 were called at the Tahsildar’s office at Roha for
identification of the accused. There were twenty persons in one
room.     According to PW-1, he identified four persons in the
presence of Tahisldar and two panchas. Those four persons were
the accused Nos.1 to 4 before the Court as identified by him in the
Court as well. He was told by the police that they had seized cash
of Rs.3,81,000/- and some gold and silver ornaments from the
accused. He identified the cell-phone of PW-2 produced before the
He was cross-examined on behalf of the accused. In the
cross-examination he was cross-examined as to how the amount
was in their possession. According to him, he had prepared three
copies of delivery challen and on the delivery challen itself the
receipt of amount was mentioned. A copy of the delivery challen
was given to the police, but, it is not produced on record. He
deposed that because of the stick blow, he suffered injury on his
right shoulder and PW-2 suffered injury on his leg because of fall
from motorcycle. After they fell down, the accused assaulted PW-1
on his leg with sticks. He could not explain why his FIR did not
mention that his own bag was taken away by the accused. He also
could not explain as to why the FIR did not mention that they
narrated the incident to Vilas Bait.    They reached Kolad police
station at around 1.45 a.m.. He accepted that the police did not
record his statement immediately.       They went to the spot of
incident at around 2.00 a.m. and they returned to police station in
that night itself. PWs-1 & 2 were referred for medical examination
and Medical Officer treated them. He has further deposed in his
cross-examination that the police had informed him to remain
present for identification parade on 14.1.2016.        PWs-1 & 2
accordingly had gone to Tahisildar’s office on that day. However,
test identification parade was not held on 14.1.2016 and they were
called again on 18.1.2016 when the test identification parade was
held.   He admitted that the Tahsildar’s office and Roha police
station are situated in the same building. He denied the suggestion
that on 14.1.2016 the appellants were brought to the Tahsildar’s
office. He has further deposed that all the four accused were kept in
one row of sixteen dummies. He denied the suggestion that after
arrest of the accused they were shown to him and PW-2 by the
police and even on 14.1.2016 they were shown and, therefore, he
identified the appellants on 18.1.2016. In the FIR, there are no
descriptions of the accused.
(ii)      PW-2 Ankit Dasure was accompanying PW-1 Ravindra
during the incident. He has deposed in exactly the same manner as
is deposed by PW-1. However, the crucial difference is that PW-2
has deposed that there were four persons, they were initially
assaulted by one person and three more joined him. He had not
spoken about five persons.        He has further deposed that on
18.1.2016 the police called both of them for test identification
parade where he identified accused Nos.1 to 4 who were present
before the Court.
In the cross-examination he deposed that the receipts
issued by Aayan Traders and Harshad Traders were also kept in the
bag along with cash and, therefore, the receipts were not available.
The first person who assaulted them was wearing black clothes. He
has given description of four persons approximately to the police.
Those four persons assaulted him by sticks on his back and then
they snatched his bag and ran away. Because of the assault, he
suffered blunt trauma on his back. He could not explain as to why
his police statement did not mention that both of them had gone to
Vilas Bait and had narrated the incident to him and then all of them
had gone to Kolad police station. He deposed that the motorcycle
was lying at the spot and both of them went to Vilas Bait by
running. He has also deposed that both of them were referred to
Medical Officer at Roha at 9.30 a.m. He had taken PW-2’s X-ray.
Initially identification parade was to be held on 14.1.2016. They
had gone to Tahsildar’s office at Roha on that day.             He also
admitted that the Tahsildar’s office and the police station were
situated in the same building. He pleaded ignorance as to whether
all the four accused were brought to Tahsildar’s office on 14.1.2016
from Alibag jail. After that he was asked to remain present on
18.1.2016 when the test identification parade was held. All the
accused were kept in single row of sixteen dummies. Significantly
he was not shown his own mobile phone in the Court.
(iii)     PW-3 Mahesh Mohite was a pancha in whose presence
father of the other accused, who had not faced the trial along with
the appellants, had produced some cash amount. Therefore, his
evidence is not relevant for the present appellants.
(iv)      PW-4 Subhash Dahinakar was a pancha for the spot
panchnama. The spot panchnama is produced on record                      at
Exhibit-32. The motorcycle was lying at the spot and it was seized.
The spot panchnama does not show that there was any street lights
available or there was any other source of light at the spot. The
spot was surrounded by bushes, trees and hilly region.
(v)       PW-5 Rohan Patil was an important witness but he has
turned hostile. He is not a reliable witness. He was a pancha to
three panchnamas wherein the wives of the accused-appellant
Nos.1,3 & 4 had produced their ornaments.          According to the
prosecution case, those ornaments were bought with the cash
amount which was stolen by the appellants.
(vi)      PW-6 Kishor Jain was a jeweller. He has deposed that on
15.12.2015 accused No.1 and his wife had come to his shop and
they had purchased golden tops and ear-chain worth Rs.30,500/-.
He produced the receipt on record at Exhibit-39. On 16.12.2015,
the accused No.4 and his wife purchased jewellery. That receipt is
produced on record at Exhibit-40.
In the cross-examination, he admitted that the receipt
does bear the details of sales-tax and VAT.
(vii)     PW-7 Pinkesh Jain was another jeweller from whose shop
appellant No.1 and his wife had purchased a silver painjan on
15.12.2015.     He also admitted that he had not mentioned the
details of sales tax and VAT on the receipt produced at Exhibit-42 in
that connection.
(viii)    PW-8 Waman Kadam was an important witness. He
initially did not support the prosecution case and, therefore,
learned APP with permission of the Court cross-examined him. He
produced Exhbits-46, 47, 48 & 49 on record. These were the
memorandum statements given by different accused pursuant to
which different cash amounts and articles were recovered at the
instance of those accused.         Accused No.2 led the police and
panchas to a farm-house of his grand-father. He removed a box
buried under a tree. There was cash amount of Rs.53,500/-. In his
memorandum statement, he had not mentioned that particular
place where he had concealed this cash amount. Immediately after
this recovery, the appellant No.3 led to another farm-house.
Another box was buried near the bushes. It was recovered and it
was found to contain Rs.45,000/-. Immediately after that accused
No.4 led the police party to Adivasiwadi and took them to his own
house. The container was buried under-ground near his house. It
was taken out. It was found to contain Rs.1,07,000/-. After that
appellant No.1 led all of them to his sister’s hut and a box which
was kept in a corner was recovered. It was found to contain
Rs.1,43,800/-.      The memorandum statements and recovery
panchnamas showed that the memorandum statements were
recorded from 10.50 a.m. onwards on 19.12.2015. They were
recorded one after the other. Then all of them were kept in the
same jeep and thereafter the cash amount kept in the boxes was
recovered from different places upto around 5.45 p.m.. During all
this period, all the accused, panchas and police were together. The
prosecution chose to examine only one of the panchas Waman
Kadam. He had turned hostile. The other pancha Chandrakant
Sanap was not examined and no explanation was offered as to why
he was not examined. No other witnesses from the farm house or
the hut or the people around that area from where the boxes were
recovered were examined. None of the memorandum statements
mentions the places where the appellants had actually concealed
those boxes.
(ix)      PW-9     Vikram Jain was another jeweler from whom
appellant No.1 and his wife had purchased gold-rings worth
Rs.4,000/- on 15.12.2015.
(x)       PW-11 Rahul Sakpal was a pancha for panchnamas
Exhibits-61, 62 and 63. Under those panchnamas, the wives of
accused Nos.3, 4 & 5 respectively produced golden ornaments
which they had purportedly purchased from various jewellers on
15th & 16th December, 2015. The wives of these appellants had
simply produced those articles in the police station and those were
seized under panchnama in the presence of this witness.
(xi)      PW-12 was the Tahsildar Amit Munde.                The test
identification parade memo was produced on record vide Exhibit-
65 because the prosecution had made application for producing the
test identification parade report under the provisions of Section
291-A of Cr.P.C..    After the report was produced on record the
accused    asked   for   the  Tahsildar’s  cross-examination.       Their
application was allowed and PW-12 Amit Munde was cross-
examined on behalf of the accused. In the cross-examination he
deposed that the dummies were brought by the police. He also
admitted that the police station and the Tahsildar’s office were
situated in the same building. The witnesses were sitting in the
tenancy room whereas the police and the dummies were sitting in
election room. There was a passage in between two rooms. He
denied the suggestion that on 14.1.2016 the accused were brought
for T.I. parade and at that time the witnesses were shown the
accused and, therefore, they could identify the accused during test
identification parade held on 18.1.2016.
(xii)     PW-10 PI Sanjay Dhumal is the investigating officer. He
has deposed about the investigation carried out by him.              Spot
panchnama was conducted.           He then arrested all the accused.
Initially Rs.22,800/- were seized from father of the accused who
had not faced the trial with the appellants. On 19.12.2015, the
cash was recovered at the instance of the appellants as mentioned
earlier. The mobile phone was recovered at the same time when
cash was recovered at the instance of appellant No.1. Apart from
cash some ornaments were recovered at the instance of the
appellant No.1. He then requested the Tahsildar to conduct the test
identification parade. At the conclusion of the investigation he had
filed the charge-sheet. He denied the suggestion that the accused
were taken for test identification parade on 14.1.2016 and the
witnesses too were called on that day.
.            This in short is the prosecution evidence.
6.           Learned counsel for the appellants submitted that
identification of the appellants is not proved by the prosecution.
There was no light at the spot of incident. It was on a highway.
PWs-1 & 2 could not have seen the features of the accused. Their
version is not supported by any medical evidence.             No such
evidence is produced on record to show that they had suffered any
injury. There is no explanation offered as to why the doctor who
had treated PWs-1 & 2 was not examined. Vilas Bait, who is an
important witness as PWs-1 & 2 had gone to him at the first
instance, is not examined and, therefore, adverse inference is
required to be drawn.       The FIR was registered in the morning
whereas the police had visited the place of incident before
registration of the FIR. The test identification parade was not held
as per the requirement of the Criminal Manual.          Only sixteen
dummies were brought whereas the rule requires that for every
person there has to be minimum six dummies and not more than
two accused should be placed in the parade at the same time.
Whereas in the present case all the accused were asked to stand in
one row at the same time for the same parade. The other evidence
of recovery is not reliable. The pancha has turned hostile. The
evidence of the investigating officer could not be relied on in the
background of the fact that he was interested in proving the
prosecution case and his evidence shows that the investigation was
not proper.    Recovery was made from the places which were
accessible to others and the places were not in exclusive control or
possession of the appellants.        In any case, the recovered cash
amount could not be connected with the offence. As far as the
ornaments are concerned, they were of the wives of the appellants
and there is nothing to show that those have any connection with
the offence. The wives’ statements cannot be read in evidence.
They were not examined as witnesses. The evidence of the jewelers
only show that some ornaments were purchased by different
appellants but that by itself does not connect the appellants with
the crime.
7.           Learned APP, on the other hand, submitted that PWs-1
& 2 had ample opportunity to see the appellants and, therefore,
their identification can be safely relied on. She further submitted
that the mobile handset was also recovered at the instance of
accused No.1, which is an incriminating circumstance. Apart from
that the golden ornaments were seized. They were produced by
wives of the appellants. Those were purchased from the money
taken away in the offence by the accused-appellants.                     She
submitted that there is sufficient material in this case.
8.           I have considered these submissions. Though learned
counsel for the appellant tried to canvass argument suggesting
that the incident has not taken place, it is difficult to accept
such argument. No reason is brought on record to show as to why
PWs-1 & 2 would concoct a false story. The motorcycle was lying at
the spot and the police were immediately informed in the night.
Therefore, though there is no medical evidence supporting the
versions of PWs-1 & 2, that does not mean that the incident has not
taken place.
9.          The crucial question in this case is about the identity of
the accused. In that behalf in my opinion, the prosecution has
miserably failed to establish that the appellants were the actual
10.         As discussed hereinabove, the evidence shows that the
incident had taken place at a secluded spot of highway at 1.00
a.m.. There were no lights anywhere around. The motorcycle had
fallen down. The description of the accused was not mentioned in
the FIR. PW-1 has also not clearly answered as to what description
he had given of the accused. The prosecution has failed to prove
that the witnesses had sufficient opportunity to observe the features
of the accused in sufficient light.
11.         Though the prosecution case is that the appellants were
identified in the test identification parade, even that evidence is
doubtful. The witnesses i.e. PWs-1 & 2 have deposed that they
were called at the Tahsildar’s office on 14.1.2016. Inspite of that
PW-10 and PW-12 have not deposed about the date of 14.1.2016.
They have deliberately kept it vague. Therefore, there is a strong
possibility that on that day the prosecution witnesses had an
opportunity to see the accused. The prosecution has to rule out
that possibility, which is not done. All the witnesses have admitted
that the Tahsildar’s office and the police station were situated in the
same premises and, therefore, it was all the more necessary for the
prosecution to have explained that all the precautions were taken
so that the accused were concealed from the witnesses not only on
18.1.2016 but also on 14.1.2016.
12.          PW-12 in the cross-examination has admitted that the
dummies were brought by the police. In this background it was
also necessary for the prosecution to have led the evidence to show
that the witnesses i.e. PW-1 & PW-2 had no opportunity to see the
dummies. In this particular case, it was not sufficient to conceal
the accused but if the witnesses had an opportunity to see the
dummies before the test identification parade; then it was very easy
to identity the accused. This precaution is not shown to have been
taken by the investigating agency. PW-12 has admitted that the
witnesses were sitting in one room and the accused and the
dummies were sitting in the other room and there was a passage in
between. However, no further evidence is led to show that it was
not possible to see the persons in other room while sitting in one
room. Apart from that, as rightly submitted by learned counsel for
the appellants sixteen dummies were asked to take part in one
single identification parade for four accused.    All these factors
cumulatively leads to a reasonable conclusion that identification of
the accused is extremely doubtful and, therefore, benefit in that
behalf must go to the accused.
13.         Other equally important circumstance is of recovery of
ornaments and cash amount. As mentioned earlier, the ornaments
were produced by the wives of the appellants. They were not
examined and, therefore, their statements to the police in presence
of panchas cannot be read in evidence. The jewellers have only
deposed that the ornaments were purchased by different accused
and their wives on 15th & 16th December, 2015.         Significantly
neither PW-6 Kishor Jain nor PW-7 Pinkesh Jain were shown the
articles which were produced by them. Only PW-9 Vikram Jain has
identified one golden-ring. Thus recovery of ornaments falls short
of the required degree of proof.
14.         As far as recovery of cash amount is concerned, PW-8
was the only pancha examined by the prosecution. He had not
supported the prosecution case and, therefore, he was cross-
examined by the prosecution. In the cross-examination, he spoke
about the memorandum statements and the consequent recovery.
Thus, he is not a reliable witness at all.        The other pancha
Chandrakant Sanap is not examined and no explanation is offered
as to why he was not examined.            The investigating officer’s
evidence in respect of these recoveries of cash amount is vague. In
none of the statements, the accused-appellants had mentioned the
place where they had concealed the cash amount. All the accused
were taken together for effecting the recoveries. Their statements
were recorded one after the another. They were taken in the same
jeep to effect recovery. Some of the places were farm-houses and a
hut belonging to other persons and hence were accessible to others.
No other supporting evidence is led to show that only the accused
had access to those private places. Such recoveries could have been
accepted if there was an independent evidence which was reliable.
15.          The pancha PW-8 Waman Kadam has stated that when
he was called to the police station that time the police told them to
proceed towards the place where the incident had taken place.
Accordingly the police took them towards the place in order to find
the articles; those were kept there. This part of his evidence makes
the police investigation doubtful about recovery of the cash
amount.      After this cross-examination, he has given all the
favourable answers to the prosecution in answers to the leading
questions. In the cross-examination on behalf of the accused, he
admitted that when he and other panchas went to police station,
that time the police told them as to which articles were to be seized
and that the police themselves informed them as to which places
were to be visited. This also indicates that the recovery was made
at the instance of the accused but the police already knew the
places from where the recovery was to be effected. There was no
further re-examination on behalf of the prosecution to clarify this.
16.          The evidence of the investigating officer is not
satisfactory. He has tried to cover up lapses in arranging the test
identification parade by the police and, therefore, it is not safe to
rely upon his evidence in respect of recovery of cash amount.
17.          As discussed earlier, the pancha is also not reliable.
Therefore, it is not safe to rely on such type of evidence which is
the only other evidence apart from doubtful identification;
available with the prosecution against the appellants.
18.          In this particular case in view of these infirmities,
benefit of doubt must go to the accused.        There are no other
incriminating circumstances against the appellants.
19.              The appellants are in custody since 17.12.2015.
Considering the above discussion, the appellants deserve to be
acquitted. Hence, the following order :
ii. The impugned judgment and order dated 10.8.2018 passed
by the Additional Sessions Judge, Mangaon, Raigad in
Sessions Case No.27/2016, is set aside.
iii. The appellants are acquitted from the charges faced by them
in Sessions Case No.27/2016 before the Additional Sessions
Judge, Mangaon, Raigad. The appellants shall be released
from jail, if not required in any other case.
iv. Criminal Appeal is disposed of in aforesaid terms. With
disposal of the appeal, all the connected applications are also
disposed of.
