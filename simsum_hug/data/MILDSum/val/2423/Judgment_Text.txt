2. This appeal has been filed by the appellant who is aggrieved by the order dated
13.02.2020, by which a Division Bench of the Madhya Pradesh High Court has set
aside the order of the learned Single Judge dated 27.06.2019 , which had granted the
benefit of regularization to the present appellant.
3. The case of the appellant is that he was engaged in 1980 as a Supervisor, on daily
rated basis, under a project of the State Water Resources Department of Madhya
Pradesh. The appellant sought regularization on the post of Supervisor/Time Keeper.
Admittedly, the minimum qualification for the said post was matriculation with
mathematics; a qualification which the appellant did not possess. These qualifications
were relaxed by a Government Circular dated 31.12.2010 and the appellant sought
his regularization on the post of Supervisor/Time Keeper, as he was qualified for the
post and had been working on daily wage basis for a long period of time. In fact, in
another writ petition (W.P. 13997/2010) filed by the appellant earlier, the High Court
of Madhya Pradesh vide order dated 02.11.2017, had given directions to the State
Government to decide the claim of the writ petitioner in accordance with law. Vide
order dated 18.06.2018 issued by the Office of Chief Engineer, Rani Avanti Bai Lodhi
Sagar Project, the claim of the appellant for regularization was rejected for the reasons
that though the minimum qualifications of matriculation with mathematics will not come
in the way for his regularization, but the fact remains that the appellant was never
appointed against any post. Moreover, his appointment was never made by the
competent authority and there were no posts available at the time for regularization.
The appellant on the other hand, had set his claim for regularization as persons who
were junior to him as daily wagers were regularized in the year 1990 or even before.
The learned Single Judge while allowing the writ petition gave directions for
regularization of the appellant from the date on which his juniors were regularized.
This order was challenged by the State Government before a Division Bench which
allowed the appeal of the State Government. The Division Bench rightly held that the
learned Single Judge has not followed the principle of law as given by this Court in
Secretary, State of Karnataka and Ors. v. Umadevi and Ors. 1 , as initial
appointment must be done by the competent authority and there must be a sanctioned
post on which the daily rated employee must be working. These two conditions were
clearly missing in the case of the present appellant. The Division Bench of the High
Court therefore has to our mind rightly allowed the appeal and set aside the order
4. In view of the law laid down by the Constitution Bench of this Court in Uma Devi
(supra), the appellant had no case for regularization. There is no scope, hence, for
our interference with the order of the Division Bench of the Madhya Pradesh High
Court. Appeal is dismissed.
