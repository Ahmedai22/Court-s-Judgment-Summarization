The petitioners in these petitions are before this Court
seeking a prayer that the order of conviction dated 25.11.2010,
passed in S.C.No.2/2007, by the District and Sessions Judge,
Chikkaballapura,    for  different offences  to  run   concurrently.
Petitioners are convicted - accused Nos.1 and 2.
2. Heard Sri M.R.Nanjunda Gowda, learned counsel for the
petitioners and Smt.K.P.Yashodha, learned High Court Government
Pleader appearing for the respondent in both the cases.
3. Brief facts of the case that leads the petitioners to this
Court in the subject petitions as borne out from the pleadings are
On 03.09.2002, as crime comes to be registered against
accused Nos.1 to 3 for the offences punishable under Sections 302,
201, 120B, r/w. 34 of the IPC.          The concerned Court took
cognizance of the offences in C.C.No.442/2002 and after the case
being committed to the Court of Sessions, the Sessions Judge
registers a case in S.C.No.45/2003. The Sessions Court in terms of
its order dated 09.12.2010, convicts accused Nos.1 and 2, the
petitioners herein and sentenced to undergo life imprisonment and
pay fine of Rs.50,000/- for offence punishable under Section 302 of
the IPC and in default of payment of fine, they shall undergo further
rigorous imprisonment for a period of six months. They were also
convicted and sentenced to undergo rigorous imprisonment for a
period of ten years and payment of Rs.50,000/- each and in default
to pay fine, to undergo further rigorous imprisonment for a period
of six months for the offence punishable under Section 394 of the
IPC.   The petitioners are now knocking at the doors of this Court
contending that they are in prison since 22.09.2002, which is more
than twenty years as of now and are entitled to seek remission or
premature release in terms of the Rules and guidelines.      What is
coming in the way is the absence of a direction by the concerned
Court that the sentences should run concurrently.          Therefore,
notwithstanding the petitioners completing twenty years in prison
are not entitled to seek remission on the ground that the sentence
for offence punishable under Section 394 of the IPC, is in operation.
4. I have given my anxious consideration to the submission
made by the learned counsel for the petitioners and the learned
Additional Government Advocate representing the respondent.
5. The issue in the lis is in the absence of a direction in the
order of sentence, not indicating whether the offences would run
concurrently or separately and whether the relief could be granted
to the petitioners.
6. Before considering the issue qua the facts of the case, I
deem it appropriate to notice the line of law as is laid down by the
constitutional Courts in the following cases:
i. RAMESH CHILWAL @ BAMBAYYA VS. STATE OF
“3. The learned counsel appearing for the appellant has
brought to our notice that the trial Judge has convicted and
sentenced the appellant in the following order:
(i) The accused Ramesh Chilwal alias Bambayya is convicted in
Case Crime No. 580 of 2004, Special Sessions Triable Case No.
28 of 2005 under Section 302 IPC and sentence of the
rigorous imprisonment for life and a fine of Rs 1,00,000
(Rupees one lakh). In default for the payment of fine, he shall
also serve a simple imprisonment for a period of six months.
Out of this rupees one lakh, Rs 50,000 (Rupees fifty thousand)
is awarded as compensation to the family of the deceased.
(ii) The accused Ramesh Chilwal alias Bambayya is convicted
in Case Crime No. 580 of 2004, Special Sessions Triable Case
No. 28 of 2005 under Sections 2/3[3(1)], Gangsters Act and
sentence for the rigorous imprisonment of 10 (ten) years and
a fine of Rs 50,000 (Rupees fifty thousand). In default for the
payment of fine, he shall also serve a simple imprisonment for
a period of four months. Out of this Rs 50,000 (Rupees fifty
thousand), rupees twenty-five thousand is awarded as
compensation to the family of the deceased.
(iii) Accused Ramesh Chilwal alias Bambayya is convicted in
Case Crime No. 737 of 2004, Sessions Triable Case No. 118 of
2005 under Section 27 of the Arms Act and sentence for the
rigorous imprisonment of 7 (seven) years and a fine of Rs
25,000 (Rupees twenty-five thousand). In default for the
payment of fine, he shall also serve a simple imprisonment for
a period of four months. Out of this Rs 25,000, half of the
amount is awarded as compensation to the family of the
By the impugned order [Ramesh Chilwal v. State of
Uttarakhand, Criminal Appeal No. 15 of 2006, order dated
11-11-2011 (Utt)] , the said conviction and sentences were
confirmed by the High Court.
4. Since this Court issued notice only to clarify the sentence
awarded by the trial Judge, there is no need to go into all the
factual details. We are not inclined to modify the sentence.
However, considering the fact that the trial Judge has awarded
life sentence for an offence under Section 302, in view of
Section 31 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973, we make
it clear that all the sentences imposed under IPC, the
Gangsters Act and the Arms Act are to run concurrently.
5. While confirming the conviction, we clarify that all the
sentences are to run concurrently. To this extent, the
judgment of the trial court as affirmed by the High Court is
modified. The appeals are disposed of accordingly.”
“7. So, the short question, which arises for consideration in
this appeal, is whether the courts below were justified in
convicting the appellant.
8. Heard the learned counsel for the parties.
9. The learned counsel for the appellant (accused) while
assailing the legality and correctness of the impugned order
argued only one point.
10. The only submission made by the learned counsel for the
appellant was that the Judicial Magistrate while passing the
order of sentence erred in not mentioning therein as to
whether the two punishments awarded to the appellant under
Section 279 and Section 304-A IPC would run concurrently or
consecutively.
11. The learned counsel pointed out that under Section 31 of
the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (hereinafter referred to
as “the Code”), it is mandatory for the Magistrate to specify as
to whether the sentences awarded to the accused would run
concurrently or consecutively when the accused is convicted
for more than one offence in a trial.
12. The learned counsel urged that since in this case the
appellant was awarded two years' rigorous imprisonment with
a fine amount of Rs 1000 and in default of payment of fine
amount, to further undergo simple imprisonment for one
month under Section 304-A IPC and six months' rigorous
imprisonment with a fine amount of Rs 1000 and in default of
payment of fine amount, to further undergo simple
imprisonment for 15 days under Section 279 IPC, these two
punishments should have been directed to run concurrently as
provided under Section 31(1) of the Code.
13. The learned counsel for the State, however, could not find
fault in the legal position, which governs the issue, and, in our
view, rightly.
14. Having heard the learned counsel for the parties and on
perusal of the record of the case, we are inclined to allow the
appeal and modify the order of the Magistrate dated 12-5-
2017, as indicated under.
15. In our considered opinion, it was necessary for the
Magistrate to have ensured compliance with Section 31 of the
Code when she convicted and sentenced the appellant for two
offences in a trial and inflicted two punishments for each
offence, namely, Section 279 and Section 304-A IPC.
16. In such a situation, it was necessary for the Magistrate to
have specified in the order by taking recourse to Section 31 of
the Code as to whether the punishment of sentence of
imprisonment so awarded by her for each offence would run
concurrently or consecutively.
17. Indeed, it being a legal requirement contemplated under
Section 31 of the Code, the Magistrate erred in not ensuring
its compliance while inflicting the two punishments to the
18. If the Magistrate failed in her duty, the Additional Sessions
Judge and the High Court should have noticed this error
committed by the Magistrate and accordingly should have
corrected it. It was, however, not done and hence interference
is called for to that extent.
19. As mentioned above, the appellant was convicted and
accordingly punished with a sentence to undergo two years'
rigorous imprisonment with a fine amount of Rs 1000 and in
default of payment of fine amount to further undergo one
month's simple imprisonment under Section 304-A and 6
months' rigorous imprisonment with a fine amount of Rs 1000
and in default of payment of fine amount to further undergo
15 days' simple imprisonment under Section 279 IPC.
20. In our view, having regard to the facts and circumstances
of the case and keeping in view the nature of controversy
involved in the case, both the aforementioned sentences
awarded by the Magistrate to the appellant would run
“6. We have heard the learned counsel for the parties at
considerable length. Section 31 CrPC which deals with
sentences in cases of conviction of several offences at one trial
“31. Sentence in cases of conviction of several offences at
one trial.—(1) When a person is convicted at one trial of
two or more offences, the court may, subject to the
provisions of Section 71 of the Penal Code, 1860,
sentence him for such offences, to the several
punishments prescribed therefor which such court is
competent to inflict; such punishments when consisting of
imprisonment to commence the one after the expiration
of the other in such order as the court may direct, unless
the court directs that such punishments shall run
concurrently.
(2) In the case of consecutive sentences, it shall not be
necessary for the court by reason only of the aggregate
punishment for the several offences being in excess of the
punishment which it is competent to inflict on conviction
of a single offence, to send the offender for trial before a
(a) in no case shall such person be sentenced to
imprisonment for longer period than fourteen years;
(b) the aggregate punishment shall not exceed twice the
amount of punishment which the court is competent to
inflict for a single offence.
(3) For the purpose of appeal by a convicted person, the
aggregate of the consecutive sentences passed against
him under this section shall be deemed to be a single
sentence.”
7. A careful reading of the above would show that the
provision is attracted only in cases where two essentials are
satisfied viz. (1) a person is convicted at one trial, and (2) the
trial is for two or more offences. It is only when both these
conditions are satisfied that the court can sentence the
offender to several punishments prescribed for the offences
committed by him provided the court is otherwise competent
to impose such punishments. What is significant is that such
punishments as the court may decide to award for several
offences committed by the convict when comprising
imprisonment shall commence one after the expiration of the
other in such order as the court may direct unless the court in
its discretion orders that such punishment shall run
concurrently. Sub-section (2) of Section 31 on a plain reading
makes it unnecessary for the court to send the offender for
trial before a higher court only because the aggregate
punishment for several offences happens to be in excess of the
punishment which such court is competent to award provided
always that in no case can the person so sentenced be
imprisoned for a period longer than 14 years and the
aggregate punishment does not exceed twice the punishment
which the court is competent to inflict for a single offence.
8. Interpreting Section 31(1), a three-Judge Bench of this
Court in O.M. Cherian case [O.M. Cherian v. State of Kerala,
(2015) 2 SCC 501 : (2015) 2 SCC (Cri) 123] declared that if
two life sentences are imposed on a convict the court must
necessarily direct those sentences to run concurrently. The
Court said: (SCC pp. 509-10, para 13)
“13. Section 31(1) CrPC enjoins a further direction
by the court to specify the order in which one
particular sentence shall commence after the
expiration of the other. Difficulties arise when the
courts impose sentence of imprisonment for life and
also sentences of imprisonment for fixed term. In
such cases, if the court does not direct that the
sentences shall run concurrently, then the
sentences will run consecutively by operation of
Section 31(1) CrPC. There is no question of the
convict    first   undergoing     the  sentence      of
imprisonment for life and thereafter undergoing the
rest of the sentences of imprisonment for fixed
term and any such direction would be unworkable.
Since sentence of imprisonment for life means jail
till the end of normal life of the convict, the
sentence of imprisonment of fixed term has to
necessarily      run    concurrently      with     life
imprisonment. In such case, it will be in order if the
Sessions Judges exercise their discretion in issuing
direction for concurrent running of sentences.
Likewise if two life sentences are imposed on the
convict, necessarily, the court has to direct those
sentences to run concurrently.”
9. To the same effect is the decision of a two-Judge
Bench of this Court in Duryodhan Rout case [Duryodhan
Rout v. State of Orissa, (2015) 2 SCC 783 : (2015) 2 SCC
(Cri) 306] in which this Court took the view that since
life imprisonment means imprisonment of full span of
life there was no question of awarding consecutive
sentences in case of conviction for several offences at
one trial. Relying upon the proviso to sub-section (2) of
Section 31, this Court held that where a person is
convicted for several offences including one for which
life sentences can be awarded the proviso to Section
31(2) shall forbid        running of such sentences
pronouncements that the logic behind life sentences not
running consecutively lies in the fact that imprisonment
for life implies imprisonment till the end of the normal
life of the convict. If that proposition is sound, the logic
underlying the ratio of the decisions of this Court in
O.M. Cherian [O.M. Cherian v. State of Kerala, (2015) 2
SCC 501 : (2015) 2 SCC (Cri) 123] and Duryodhan Rout
[Duryodhan Rout v. State of Orissa, (2015) 2 SCC 783 :
(2015) 2 SCC (Cri) 306] cases would also be equally
sound. What then needs to be examined is whether
imprisonment for life does indeed imply imprisonment
till the end of the normal life of the convict as observed
in O.M. Cherian [O.M. Cherian v. State of Kerala, (2015)
2 SCC 501 : (2015) 2 SCC (Cri) 123] and Duryodhan
Rout [Duryodhan Rout v. State of Orissa, (2015) 2 SCC
783 : (2015) 2 SCC (Cri) 306] cases. That question, in
our considered opinion, is no longer res integra, the
same having been examined and answered in the
affirmative by a long line of decisions handed down by
this Court. We may gainfully refer to some of those
decisions at this stage.
11. In Gopal Vinayak Godse v. State of Maharashtra [Gopal
Vinayak Godse v. State of Maharashtra, (1961) 3 SCR 440 :
AIR 1961 SC 600 : (1961) 1 Cri LJ 736] , a Constitution Bench
of this Court held that a prisoner sentenced to life
imprisonment was bound to serve the remainder of his life in
prison unless the sentence is commuted or remitted by the
appropriate authority. Such a sentence could not be equated
with a fixed term.
12. In Dalbir Singh v. State of Punjab [Dalbir Singh v. State of
Punjab, (1979) 3 SCC 745 : 1979 SCC (Cri) 848] , a three-
Judge Bench of this Court observed: (SCC p. 753, para 14)
“14. … life imprisonment which strictly means
imprisonment for the whole of the man's life, but in
practice amounts to incarceration for a period between 10
and 14 years which may, at the option of the convicting
court, be subject to the condition that the sentence of
imprisonment shall last as long as life lasts where there
are exceptional indications of murderous recidivism and
the community cannot run the risk of the convict being at
large.”
13. Again in State of Punjab v. Joginder Singh [State of Punjab
this Court held that if the sentence is “imprisonment for life”
the convict has to pass the remainder of his life under
imprisonment unless of course he is granted remission by a
competent authority in exercise of the powers vested in it
under Sections 432 and 433 CrPC.
14. In Maru Ram v. Union of India [Maru Ram v. Union of
India, (1981) 1 SCC 107 : 1981 SCC (Cri) 112] also this Court
following Godse case [Gopal Vinayak Godse v. State of
Cri LJ 736] held that imprisonment for life lasts until last
breath of the prisoner and whatever the length of remissions
earned the prisoner could claim release only if the remaining
sentence is remitted by the Government. The Court observed:
(Maru Ram case [Maru Ram v. Union of India, (1981) 1 SCC
107 : 1981 SCC (Cri) 112] , SCC p. 154, para 72)
“72. … (6) We follow Godse case [Gopal Vinayak Godse v.
State of Maharashtra, (1961) 3 SCR 440 : AIR 1961 SC
600 : (1961) 1 Cri LJ 736] to hold that imprisonment for
life lasts until the last breath, and whatever the length of
remission earned the prisoner can claim release only if
the remaining sentence is remitted by the Government.”
15. In Ashok Kumar v. Union of India [Ashok Kumar v. Union
of India, (1991) 3 SCC 498 : 1991 SCC (Cri) 845] , this Court
had yet another occasion to examine the true meaning and
purport of expression “imprisonment for life” and declared that
when read in the light of Section 45 IPC the said expression
would ordinarily mean the full and complete span of life. The
following passage in this regard is apposite: (SCC p. 513, para
“12. … The expression “imprisonment for life” must be
read in the context of Section 45 IPC. Under that
provision the word “life” denotes the life of a human being
unless the contrary appears from the context. We have
seen that the punishments are set out in Section 53,
imprisonment for life being one of them. Read in the light
of Section 45 it would ordinarily mean imprisonment for
the full or complete span of life.” in Laxman Naskar v.
Union of India [Laxman Naskar v. Union of India, (2000)
2 SCC 595 : 2000 SCC (Cri) 509] , wherein this Court
held that life sentence is nothing less than lifelong
imprisonment although by earning remission, the life
convict could pray for pre-mature release before
completing 20 years of imprisonment including remissions
earned.
16. To the same effect is the decision of this Court in the case
of Laxman Naskar vs. Union of India, (2000) 2 SCC 595 where
this Court held that life sentence is nothing less than lifelong
imprisonment although by earning remission, the life convict
could pray for pre-mature release before completing 20 years
of imprisonment including remissions earned.
17. Reference may also be made to the decisions of this Court
in Subash Chander v. Krishan Lal [Subash Chander v. Krishan
v. State of Rajasthan [Shri Bhagwan v. State of Rajasthan,
(2001) 6 SCC 296 : 2001 SCC (Cri) 1095] and Swamy
Shraddananda      (2)    v.  State   of   Karnataka     [Swamy
Shraddananda (2) v. State of Karnataka, (2008) 13 SCC 767 :
(2009) 3 SCC (Cri) 113] , which too reiterate the legal position
settled by the earlier mentioned decisions of this Court. A
recent Constitution Bench decision of this Court in Union of
India v. Sriharan [Union of India v. Sriharan, (2016) 7 SCC 1]
, also had another occasion to review the case law on the
subject. Relying upon the decisions of this Court in Sambha Ji
Krishan Ji [Sambha Ji Krishan Ji v. State of Maharashtra,
of M.P. v. Ratan Singh, (1976) 3 SCC 470 : 1976 SCC (Cri)
428] , Maru Ram [Maru Ram v. Union of India, (1981) 1 SCC
107 : 1981 SCC (Cri) 112] and Ranjit Singh [Ranjit Singh v.
UT of Chandigarh, (1984) 1 SCC 31 : 1984 SCC (Cri) 27]
cases this Court observed:
“It is quite apparent that this Court by stating as above
has affirmed the legal position that the life imprisonment
only means the entirety of the life unless it is curtailed by
remissions validly granted under the Code of Criminal
Procedure by the appropriate Government or under
Articles 72 and 161 of the Constitution by the Executive
Head viz. the President or the Governor of the State,
respectively.”
18. The legal position is, thus, fairly well settled that
imprisonment for life is a sentence for the remainder of
the life of the offender unless of course the remaining
sentence is commuted or remitted by the competent
authority. That being so, the provisions of Section 31
under CrPC must be so interpreted as to be consistent
with the basic tenet that a life sentence requires the
prisoner to spend the rest of his life in prison. Any
direction that requires the offender to undergo
imprisonment for life twice over would be anomalous
and irrational for it will disregard the fact that humans
like all other living beings have but one life to live. So
understood Section 31(1) would permit consecutive
running of sentences only if such sentences do not
happen to be life sentences. That is, in our opinion, the
only way one can avoid an obvious impossibility of a
prisoner serving two consecutive life sentences.
19. A somewhat similar question fell for consideration before a
three-Judge Bench of this Court in Ranjit Singh v. UT of
Chandigarh [Ranjit Singh v. UT of Chandigarh, (1991) 4 SCC
304 : 1991 SCC (Cri) 965] . The prisoner was in that case
convicted for murder and sentenced to undergo life
imprisonment. He was released on parole while undergoing the
life sentence when he committed a second offence of murder
for which also he was convicted and sentenced to undergo
imprisonment for life. In an appeal filed against the second
conviction and sentence, this Court by an order dated 30-9-
1983 [Ranjit Singh v. UT of Chandigarh, (1984) 1 SCC 31 :
1984 SCC (Cri) 27] directed that the imprisonment for life
awarded to him should not run concurrently with his earlier
sentence of life imprisonment. The Court directed that in the
event of remission or commutation of the earlier sentence
awarded to the prisoner, the second imprisonment for life
awarded for the second murder committed by him shall
commence. Aggrieved by the said direction which made the
second life sentence awarded to him consecutive, the prisoner
filed a writ petition under Article 32 of the Constitution
primarily on the ground that this Court's order dated 30-9-
1983 [Ranjit Singh v. UT of Chandigarh, (1984) 1 SCC 31 :
1984 SCC (Cri) 27] was contrary to Section 427(2) CrPC,
according to which any person already undergoing sentence of
imprisonment for life if sentenced to undergo imprisonment for
life, the subsequent sentence so awarded to him shall run
concurrently with such previous sentence.
20. Relying upon Godse [Gopal Vinayak Godse v. State of
Cri LJ 736] and Maru Ram [Maru Ram v. Union of India,
(1981) 1 SCC 107 : 1981 SCC (Cri) 112] cases, this Court held
in Ranjit Singh case [Ranjit Singh v. UT of Chandigarh, (1991)
4 SCC 304 : 1991 SCC (Cri) 965] that imprisonment for life is
a sentence for remainder of the life of the offender. There was,
therefore, no question of a subsequent sentence of
imprisonment for life running consecutively as per the general
rule contained in sub-section (1) of Section 427. This Court
observed: (SCC pp. 310-11, para 8)
“8. … As rightly contended by Shri Garg, and not disputed
by Shri Lalit, the earlier sentence of imprisonment for life
being understood to mean as a sentence to serve the
remainder of life in prison unless commuted or remitted
by the appropriate authority and a person having only
one life span, the sentence on a subsequent conviction of
imprisonment for a term or imprisonment for life can only
be superimposed to the earlier life sentence and certainly
not added to it since extending the life span of the
offender or for that matter anyone is beyond human
might. It is this obvious situation which is stated in sub-
section (2) of Section 427 since the general rule
enunciated in sub-section (1) thereof is that without the
court's direction the subsequent sentence will not run
concurrently but consecutively. The only situation in
which no direction of the court is needed to make the
subsequent sentence run concurrently with the previous
sentence is provided for in sub-section (2) which has
been enacted to avoid any possible controversy based on
sub-section (1) if there be no express direction of the
court to that effect. Sub-section (2) is in the nature of an
exception to the general rule enacted in sub-section (1) of
Section 427 that a sentence on subsequent conviction
commences on expiry of the first sentence unless the
court directs it to run concurrently. The meaning and
purpose of sub-sections (1) and (2) of Section 427 and
the object of enacting sub-section (2) is, therefore,
clear.”
21. Having said that, this Court in Ranjit Singh case [Ranjit
Singh v. UT of Chandigarh, (1991) 4 SCC 304 : 1991 SCC (Cri)
965] declared that once the subsequent imprisonment for life
awarded to the prisoner is superimposed over the earlier life
sentence, the grant of any remission or commutation qua the
earlier sentence of life imprisonment will not ipso facto benefit
the prisoner qua the subsequent sentence of life
imprisonment. Such subsequent sentence would continue and
shall remain unaffected by the remission or commutation of
the earlier sentence. This Court said: (SCC p. 311, para 9)
“9. … In other words, the operation of the superimposed
subsequent sentence of life imprisonment shall not be
wiped out merely because in respect of the corresponding
earlier sentence of life imprisonment any remission or
commutation has been granted by the appropriate
authority. The consequence is that the petitioner would
not get any practical benefit of any remission or
commutation in respect of his earlier sentence because of
the superimposed subsequent life sentence unless the
same corresponding benefit in respect of the subsequent
sentence is also granted to the petitioner. It is in this
manner that the direction is given for the two sentences
of life imprisonment not to run concurrently.”
22.Ranjit Singh case [Ranjit Singh v. UT of Chandigarh, (1991)
4 SCC 304 : 1991 SCC (Cri) 965] was no doubt dealing with a
fact situation different from the one with which we are dealing
in the present case, inasmuch as Ranjit Singh case [Ranjit
Singh v. UT of Chandigarh, (1991) 4 SCC 304 : 1991 SCC (Cri)
965] was covered by Section 427 CrPC as the prisoner in that
case was already undergoing a sentence of life imprisonment
when he committed a second offence of murder that led to his
conviction and award of a second sentence of life
imprisonment. In the cases at hand, the appellants were not
convicts undergoing life sentence at the time of commission of
multiple murders by them. Their cases, therefore, fall more
appropriately under Section 31 of the Code which deals with
conviction of several offences at one trial. Section 31(1) deals
with and empowers the court to award, subject to the
provisions of Section 71 IPC, several punishments prescribed
for such offences and mandates that such punishments when
consisting of imprisonment shall commence one after the
expiration of the other in such order as the court may direct
unless the court directs such punishments shall run
concurrently. The power to award suitable sentences for
several offences committed by the offenders is not and cannot
be disputed. The order in which such sentences shall run can
also be stipulated by the court awarding such sentences. So
also the court is competent in its discretion to direct that
punishment awarded shall run concurrently not consecutively.
The question, however, is whether the provision admits of
more than one life sentences running consecutively. That
question can be answered on a logical basis only if one accepts
the truism that humans have one life and the sentence of life
imprisonment once awarded would require the prisoner to
spend the remainder of his life in jail unless the sentence is
commuted or remitted by the competent authority. That, in
our opinion, happens to be the logic behind Section 427(2)
CrPC mandating that if a prisoner already undergoing life
sentence is sentenced to another imprisonment for life for a
subsequent offence committed by him, the two sentences so
awarded shall run concurrently and not consecutively. Section
427(2) in that way carves out an exception to the general rule
recognised in Section 427(1) that sentences awarded upon
conviction for a subsequent offence shall run consecutively.
23. Parliament, it manifests from the provisions of Section
427(2) CrPC, was fully cognizant of the anomaly that would
arise if a prisoner condemned to undergo life imprisonment is
directed to do so twice over. It has, therefore, carved out an
exception to the general rule to clearly recognise that in the
case of life sentences for two distinct offences separately tried
and held proved the sentences cannot be directed to run
consecutively. The provisions of Section 427(2) CrPC apart, in
Ranjit Singh case [Ranjit Singh v. UT of Chandigarh, (1991) 4
SCC 304 : 1991 SCC (Cri) 965] , this Court has in terms held
that since life sentence implies imprisonment for the
remainder of the life of the convict, consecutive life sentences
cannot be awarded as humans have only one life. That logic,
in our view, must extend to Section 31 CrPC also no matter
Section 31 does not in terms make a provision analogous to
Section 427(2) of the Code. The provision must, in our
opinion, be so interpreted as to prevent any anomaly or
irrationality. So interpreted Section 31(1) CrPC must mean
that sentences awarded by the court for several offences
committed by the prisoner shall run consecutively (unless the
court directs otherwise) except where such sentences include
imprisonment for life which can and must run concurrently. We
are also inclined to hold that if more than one life sentences
are awarded to the prisoner, the same would get
superimposed over each other. This will imply that in case the
prisoner is granted the benefit of any remission or
commutation qua one such sentence, the benefit of such
remission would not ipso facto extend to the other.
24. We may now turn to the conflict noticed in the reference
order between the decisions of this Court in Cherian [O.M.
Cherian v. State of Kerala, (2015) 2 SCC 501 : (2015) 2 SCC
(Cri) 123] and Duryodhan [Duryodhan Rout v. State of Orissa,
(2015) 2 SCC 783 : (2015) 2 SCC (Cri) 306] cases on the one
hand and Kamalanantha [Kamalanantha v. State of T.N.,
(2005) 5 SCC 194 : 2005 SCC (Cri) 1121] and Sanaullah Khan
[Sanaullah Khan v. State of Bihar, (2013) 3 SCC 52 : (2013) 2
SCC (Cri) 34] cases on the other.
25. In O.M. Cherian case [O.M. Cherian v. State of Kerala,
(2015) 2 SCC 501 : (2015) 2 SCC (Cri) 123] the prisoner was
convicted and sentenced to imprisonment for the offences
punishable under Sections 498-A and 306 IPC. The courts
below had in that case awarded to the convicts imprisonment
for two years under Section 498-A IPC and seven years under
Section 306 IPC and directed the same to run consecutively.
Aggrieved by the said direction, the prisoners appealed to this
Court to contend that the sentences awarded to them ought to
run concurrently and not consecutively. The appeal was
referred [O.M. Cherian v. State of Kerala, (2015) 2 SCC 501,
506-507 (para 5)] to a larger Bench of three Judges of this
Court in the light of the decision in Mohd. Akhtar Hussain v.
Collector of Customs [Mohd. Akhtar Hussain v. Collector of
the larger Bench, the prisoners relied upon Mohd. Akhtar
Hussain case [Mohd. Akhtar Hussain v. Collector of Customs,
(1988) 4 SCC 183 : 1988 SCC (Cri) 921] and Manoj v. State of
Haryana [Manoj v. State of Haryana, (2014) 2 SCC 153 :
(2014) 1 SCC (Cri) 763] to contend that since the prisoners
were found guilty of more than two offences committed in the
course of one incident, such sentences ought to run
concurrently. This Court upon a review of the case law on the
subject held that Section 31 CrPC vested the court with the
power to order in its discretion that the sentences awarded
shall run concurrently in case of conviction of two or more
offences. This Court declared that it was difficult to lay down a
straightjacket rule for the exercise of such discretion by the
courts. Whether a sentence should run concurrently or
consecutively would depend upon the nature of the offence
and the facts and circumstances of the case. All that could be
said was that the discretion has to be exercised along judicial
lines and not mechanically. Having said that, the Court
observed that if two life sentences are imposed on a convict
the court has to direct the same to run concurrently. That is
because     sentence    of  imprisonment       for   life   means
imprisonment till the normal life of a convict.
26. As noticed above, Cherian case [O.M. Cherian v.
State of Kerala, (2015) 2 SCC 501 : (2015) 2 SCC (Cri)
123] did not involve awarding of two or more life
sentences to the prisoner. It was a case of two term
sentences being awarded for two different offences
committed in the course of the same transaction and
tried together at one trial. Even so, this Court held that
life sentences cannot be made to run consecutively
plainly because a single life sentence ensures that the
remainder of the life of the prisoner is spent by him in
jail. Such being the case, the question of a second such
sentence being undergone consecutively did not arise.
27. In Duryodhan Rout case [Duryodhan Rout v. State of
Orissa, (2015) 2 SCC 783 : (2015) 2 SCC (Cri) 306] the
prisoner was convicted for the offences punishable
under Sections 302, 376(2)(f) and 201 IPC and
sentenced to death for the offence of murder and
rigorous imprisonment for the offence punishable under
Section 376(2)(f). Imprisonment for a period of one
year was additionally awarded under Section 201 IPC
with a direction that the sentences would run
consecutively. In appeal, the High Court altered [State
LJ 2876] the sentence of death to imprisonment for life
while leaving the remaining sentences untouched. The
petitioner then approached this Court to argue that the
sentences ought to run concurrently and not
consecutively as directed by the courts below. Relying
upon the decision of this Court in Gopal Vinayak case
[Gopal Vinayak Godse v. State of Maharashtra, (1961) 3
SCR 440 : AIR 1961 SC 600 : (1961) 1 Cri LJ 736] and
several other subsequent decisions on the subject this
Court held that the sentence of imprisonment for life
means imprisonment for the remainder of the life of the
prisoner. The Court further held that Section 31 CrPC
would not permit consecutive running of life sentence
and the term sentence since the aggregate punishment
of the petitioner would go beyond the outer limit of 14
years stipulated in the proviso to Section 31(2) CrPC.
The Court observed: (Duryodhan Rout case [Duryodhan
Rout v. State of Orissa, (2015) 2 SCC 783 : (2015) 2 SCC
(Cri) 306] , SCC p. 794, para 29)
“29. Section 31 CrPC relates to sentence in cases of
conviction of several offences at one trial. The proviso to
sub-section (2) of Section 31 lays down the embargo
whether the aggregate punishment of prisoner is for a
period of longer than 14 years. In view of the fact that life
imprisonment means imprisonment for full and complete
span of life, the question of consecutive sentences in case
of conviction for several offences at one trial does not
arise. Therefore, in case a person is sentenced of
conviction of several offences, including one that of life
imprisonment, the proviso to Section 31(2) shall come
into play and no consecutive sentence can be imposed.”
28. While we have no doubt about the correctness of the
proposition that two life sentences cannot be directed to run
consecutively, we do not think that the reason for saying so
lies in the proviso to Section 31(2). Section 31(2) CrPC deals
with situations where the court awarding consecutive
sentences is not competent to award the aggregate of the
punishment for the several offences for which the prisoner is
being sentenced upon conviction. A careful reading of sub-
section (2) would show that the same is concerned only with
situations where the courts awarding the sentence and
directing the same to run consecutively is not competent to
award the aggregate of the punishment upon conviction for a
single offence. The proviso further stipulates that in cases
falling under sub-section (2), the sentence shall in no case go
beyond 14 years and the aggregate punishment shall not
exceed twice the amount of punishment which the court is
competent to award. Now in cases tried by the Sessions Court,
there is no limitation as to the court's power to award any
punishment sanctioned by law including the capital
punishment. Sub-section (2) will, therefore, have no
application to a case tried by the Sessions Court nor would
sub-section (2) step in to forbid a direction for consecutive
running of sentences awardable by the Court of Session.
29. To the extent Duryodhan Rout case [Duryodhan Rout v.
State of Orissa, (2015) 2 SCC 783 : (2015) 2 SCC (Cri) 306]
relies upon proviso to sub-section (2) to support the
conclusion that a direction for consecutive running of
sentences is impermissible, it does not state the law correctly,
even when the conclusion that life imprisonment means for the
full span of one's life and consecutive life sentences cannot be
awarded is otherwise sound and acceptable.
30. In Kamalanantha v. State of T.N. [Kamalanantha v. State
of T.N., (2005) 5 SCC 194 : 2005 SCC (Cri) 1121] , the
prisoners were convicted amongst others for the offences
under Sections 376, 302, 354 IPC and sentenced to undergo
rigorous imprisonment for life for the offences under Sections
376 and 302 IPC and various terms of imprisonment for other
offences with the direction that the sentences awarded shall
run consecutively. One of the issues that was raised in support
of the appeal was that the courts below were not justified in
awarding consecutive life sentences. That contention was
rejected by a two-Judge Bench of this Court in the following
words: (SCC p. 229, para 76)
“76. The contention of Mr Jethmalani that the term
“imprisonment” enjoined in Section 31 CrPC does not
include imprisonment for life is unacceptable. The term
“imprisonment” is not defined under the Code of Criminal
Procedure. Section 31 of the Code falls under Chapter III
of the Code which deals with power of courts. Section 28
of the Code empowers the High Court to pass any
sentence authorised by law. Similarly, the Sessions Judge
and Additional Sessions Judge may pass any sentence
authorised by law, except the sentence of death which
shall be subject to confirmation by the High Court. In our
opinion the term “imprisonment” would include the
sentence of imprisonment for life.”
31. The above view runs contrary to the ratio of this Court's
decision in Cherian case [O.M. Cherian v. State of Kerala,
(2015) 2 SCC 501 : (2015) 2 SCC (Cri) 123] and Duryodhan
Rout case [Duryodhan Rout v. State of Orissa, (2015) 2 SCC
783 : (2015) 2 SCC (Cri) 306] . That apart the view taken in
Kamalanantha case [Kamalanantha v. State of T.N., (2005) 5
SCC 194 : 2005 SCC (Cri) 1121] has not noticed the basic
premise that a life sentence once awarded would imply that a
prisoner shall spend the remainder of his life in prison. Once
that happens there is no question of his undergoing another
life sentence. To the extent the decision in Kamalanantha case
[Kamalanantha v. State of T.N., (2005) 5 SCC 194 : 2005 SCC
(Cri) 1121] takes the view that the Court can for each offence
award suitable punishment which may include multiple
sentences of imprisonment for life for multiple offences
punishable with death, there is and can be no quarrel with the
stated proposition. The Court can and indeed ought to exercise
its powers of awarding the sentence sanctioned by law which
may include a life sentence. But if the decision in
Kamalanantha [Kamalanantha v. State of T.N., (2005) 5 SCC
194 : 2005 SCC (Cri) 1121] purports to hold that sentence of
imprisonment for life can also be directed to run consecutively,
the same does not appear to be sound for the reasons we
have already indicated earlier. We need to remember that
award of multiple sentences of imprisonment for life so that
such sentences are superimposed over one another is entirely
different from directing such sentence to run consecutively.
32.Sanaullah Khan v. State of Bihar [Sanaullah Khan v. State
of Bihar, (2013) 3 SCC 52 : (2013) 2 SCC (Cri) 34] simply
follows the view taken in Kamalanantha case [Kamalanantha
v. State of T.N., (2005) 5 SCC 194 : 2005 SCC (Cri) 1121]
and, therefore, does not add any new dimension to call for any
further deliberation on the subject.
33. We are not unmindful of the fact that this Court has in
several other cases directed sentences of imprisonment for life
to run consecutively having regard to the gruesome and brutal
nature of the offence committed by the prisoner. For instance,
this Court has in Ravindra Trimbak Chouthmal v. State of
Maharashtra [Ravindra Trimbak Chouthmal v. State of
Maharashtra, (1996) 4 SCC 148 : 1996 SCC (Cri) 608] , while
commuting death sentence penalty to one of imprisonment for
life directed that the sentence of seven years' rigorous
imprisonment under Section 207 IPC shall start running after
life imprisonment has run its due course. So also in Ronny v.
State of Maharashtra [Ronny v. State of Maharashtra, (1998)
3 SCC 625 : 1998 SCC (Cri) 859] this Court has while altering
the death sentence to that of imprisonment for life directed
that while the sentence for all other offences shall run
concurrently, the sentence under Section 376(2)(g) IPC shall
run consecutively after running of sentences for other
offences. To the extent these decisions may be understood to
hold that life sentence can also run consecutively do not lay
down the correct law and shall stand overruled.
34. In conclusion our answer to the question is in the
negative. We hold that while multiple sentences for
imprisonment for life can be awarded for multiple murders or
other offences punishable with imprisonment for life, the life
sentences so awarded cannot be directed to run consecutively.
Such sentences would, however, be superimposed over each
other so that any remission or commutation granted by the
competent authority in one does not ipso facto result in
remission of the sentence awarded to the prisoner for the
35. We may, while parting, deal with yet another
dimension of this case argued before us, namely,
whether the court can direct life sentence and term
sentences to run consecutively. That aspect was argued
keeping in view the fact that the appellants have been
sentenced to imprisonment for different terms apart
from being awarded imprisonment for life. The trial
court's direction affirmed by the High Court is that the
said term sentences shall run consecutively. It was
contended on behalf of the appellants that even this
part of the direction is not legally sound, for once the
prisoner is sentenced to undergo imprisonment for life,
the term sentence awarded to him must run
concurrently. We do not, however, think so. The power of
the court to direct the order in which sentences will run is
unquestionable in view of the language employed in Section
31 CrPC. The court can, therefore, legitimately direct that the
prisoner shall first undergo the term sentence before the
commencement of his life sentence. Such a direction shall be
perfectly legitimate and in tune with Section 31 CrPC. The
converse however may not be true for if the court directs the
life sentence to start first it would necessarily imply that the
term sentence would run concurrently. That is because once
the prisoner spends his life in jail, there is no question of his
undergoing any further sentence. Whether or not the direction
of the court below calls for any modification or alteration is a
matter with which we are not concerned. The regular Bench
hearing the appeals would be free to deal with that aspect of
the matter having regard to what we have said in the
foregoing paragraphs.
36. The reference is accordingly answered.”
(Emphasis supplied)
In the light of the judgments rendered by the Apex Court as quoted
(supra), the impugned order requires to be noticed. The impugned
order in S.C.No.02 of 2007 rendered on 25.11.2010 insofar as it
pertains to imposition of sentence reads as follows:
Accused Nos.1 and 2 are convicted and sentenced to
under go Life Imprisonment and shall also pay fine of
Rs.50,000/- each and in default of payment of fine they shall
under go further rigorous imprisonment for a period of six
months in respect of the offence punishable u/s 302 IPC.
Accused Nos.1 to 3 are also convicted and sentenced
to under go rigorous imprisonment for a period of ten years
and shall pay fine of Rs.50,000/- each and in default of
payment of fine they shall under go further rigorous
imprisonment for a period of six months in respect of the
offence punishable u/s 394 of IPC.
On deposit of fine, 50% of it shall be paid to PW3
Shanthamma by way of compensation under section 357 of
Accused are entitled to benefit of set off under section
428 of Cr.P.C.,
So far as property is concerned, MOs 2 to 5, 9 to 13,
25 to 28 being valueless shall be destroyed, rest of the
articles shall be returned to PW1 Ganapathy Shetty and PW3
Shanthamma, after expiry of appeal period if no appeal is
preferred.
Issue conviction warrant and furnish free copy of this
judgment to accused forthwith.”
The order directs that the convicts/accused 1 and 2 are ordered to
undergo life imprisonment for offence punishable under Section 302
of the IPC. Further, for offence punishable under Section 394 of the
IPC, they are required to undergo rigorous imprisonment for 10
years.    There is no indication in the order whether the sentences
would run concurrently or one after the other. Therefore, the issue
with regard to such finding is left unattended by the concerned
Court. The maximum punishment that is imposed initially against
the petitioners is imprisonment for life for offence punishable under
Section 302 of the IPC and later imprisonment for 10 years under
Section 394 of the IPC. On the bedrock of the principles laid down
by the judgment of the Apex Court that if life imprisonment is the
punishment that is imposed, the term sentence will have to run
concurrently and in the light of the issue being covered by the
judgments quoted (supra), I deem it appropriate direct that the
sentence imposed upon the petitioners by the impugned order of
conviction dated 25.11.2010 in S.C.No.02 of 2007 passed by
District   and    Sessions    Judge,   Chikkaballapura    would   run
7. For the aforesaid reasons, the following:
i.    The Criminal Petitions are allowed.
ii.  The sentences imposed upon the petitioners in terms of
the impugned order of conviction dated 25.11.2010,
passed in S.C.No.02/2007, shall run concurrently.
Ordered accordingly.
