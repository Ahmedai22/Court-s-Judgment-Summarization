 "It appears that neither the police nor, Election Commission did anything to save the people on election duty from getting infected by this deadly virus," the High Court had observed while issuing notice to the UP State Election Commission, Lucknow.
 On Friday, SEC's counsel Tarun Agrawal informed the Court that so far, 77 deaths have been reported from 28 districts and sought a week's time to come up with reports from other districts.
 He also sought time to file response regarding the role of State Election Commission in conducting elections, more particularly during the pandemic.
 In its previous order, the High Court had sought CCTV footage of the designated counting areas to see if Covid protocols were followed.
 Today, the State Election Commission produced certain photographs of the counting centres and some of the CCTV clips. It further submitted that reports from majority of the Nodal Officers were still awaited.
 The matter is now kept for hearing on May 11.
