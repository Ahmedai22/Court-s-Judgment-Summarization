Respondent :- State of U.P.
Counsel for Petitioner :- Gaurav Kumar Gaur,Abhinav Gaur,Aditya
Counsel for Respondent :- C.S.C.,Arun Kumar,Ashish Mishra,Dhiraj
1.     We have heard Sri S.V. Raju, learned Additional Solicitor General
of India assisted by Sri Abhishek Sharma, learned Standing Counsel, Sri
Manish Goyal, learned Additional Advocate General assisted by Sri A.K.
Goyal, learned Additional Chief Standing Counsel, both representing the
State of U.P., Sri S.P. Singh, learned Additional Solicitor General of
India assisted by Sri Purnendu Kumar, learned Advocate, Sri Tarun
Agrawal, learned counsel appearing for the State Election Commission,
Sri Amrendra Nath Singh, learned Senior Counsel and President of
Singh and Sri A.P. Paul, learned Advocates. All the learned Advocates
appeared through video conferencing.
2.     Sri Abhishek Prakash, District Magistrate, Lucknow and Sri K.
Balaji, District Magistrate, Meerut, also appeared in person through
video conferencing in compliance of our last order.
3.      The compliance affidavit filed on behalf of the Staste of U.P. as
well as State Election Commission are taken on record.                   The
intervenion application filed by Sri A.P. Paul and Sri Rajat Rajan
Singh, learned Advocates respectively are also taken on record. Office
is directed to allot regular number to both the intervention applications.
4.      Upon going through the affidavit filed today by Sri Manish
Goyal, learned Additional Advocate General, we do find that things
which were actually out of control have been demonstrated to have
now been somehow managed. We have also been informed that number
of active cases in State of U.P. were day by day declining and
procurement/ production and supply management of oxygen had also
of late been managed and was being streamlined.
5.      We have no reason to doubt that the gradual decline in active
Covid cases had been due to restrictions imposed by the State
Government on public movement and public activities in the State of
U.P. and constructive efforts that are put in by the District
Administration in various districts and the Police Administration of all
these districts in ensuring that the restrictions as imposed by the State
Government are honoured by the people. The regular electricity supply
by the Electricity Department in the entire State of U.P. was also a task
undertaken by and large to the satisfaction of the people. Although all
efforts taken till now are quite appreciable but we hasten to add that
this is no time to relax as a lot of action is still needed to be taken more
especially in the field of public health care, facility and overall public
health infrastructure in view of the impending threat of a third waive of
Covid-19 pandemic.
6.      Learned Additional Advocate General has also informed us that
conditions of referral letter of the Chief Medical Officer/ District
Magistrate for Covid patients in the hospital has been done away with.
7.     The District Magistrate, Lucknow who has appeared in person
online informed the Court that he had already submitted report in
respect of two private hospitals, namely, Sun Hospital and Samarth
Hospital. He, however, further explained that he had already conducted
preliminary investigation through SDM (Sadar) Sri Prafulla Kumar and
it had surfaced out during investigation that Sun Hospital was already
having sufficient oxygen cylinders as six jumbo oxygen cylinders were
reported to be available on the day when notice was published by the
hospital and thus according to him, it was quite apparent that the
hospital had with a mala fide intention to create panic amongst the
people, posted the notice notoriously showing scarcity of the oxygen in
the hospital. He has further submitted that as far as the other hospital is
concerned that was a non-Covid hospital and had wholly illegally
admitted the Covid patients and in respect of which the proceedings
had already been drawn against that hospital by issuing show cause
notice. He further added that Sun Hospital had also been issued with
show cause notice and proper actions would be taken after considering
the reply. The District Magistrate, Lucknow further submitted before
the Court that in Lucknow district a Nodal Officer had been appointed
to ensure continuous supply of oxygen as per the need to the hospitals,
be it government or private. He further submitted that total demand of
Liquid Medical Oxygen varied because of varying numbers of Covid
patients and demands were made on day to day basis. He further
submitted that earlier the demand was on an average about 135 matric
tones of oxygen which was more or less supplied to Lucknow district.
He further assured the Court that he would personally get the things
streamlined and monitor the same on a day to day basis and will take
stock of the situation and will also instruct the Nodal Officer to ensure
that there was no gap between the demand and supply of the Liquid
8.     District Magistrate, Lucknow assured the Court that besides the
fact that appropriate action was already underway against the two
private hospitals even in future if he came across any such news
viralled regarding ill-treatment of patients in the hospitals and
artificially created scarcity of the oxygen, he would take immediate
action in the matter. Since the explanation submitted by the District
Magistrate, Lucknow, prima facie, appears to be satisfactory, we
exempt him from personal appearance in future until and unless
required again.
9.      We, however, direct the District Magistrate, Lucknow to submit
a detailed report of the action taken against the two private hospitals if
in his final opinion it is found that mischief has been committed by
them deliberately endangering lives of innocent and creating
unnecessary panic to serve the vested interests.
10.     The District Magistrate, Meerut, who has also appeared in
person online to explain about the alleged deaths for want of oxygen in
Medical College, Meerut in its Trauma Centre, submitted that the
deaths were not caused for want of supply of oxygen but for some
other reasons. He submitted that proper oxygen was already there to
the requirement of the hospital and there was no scarcity of the same.
On a pointed query being made as to what was the exact stock in the
hospital on the fateful day, the District Magistrate, Meerut, could not
give any satisfactory reply. He also could not reply as to what was the
cause of the deaths if it was not for want of oxygen. The District
Magistrate, Meerut, in our considered view, has not conducted enquiry
in the letter and spirit of the mandate contained in our order. He should
have obtained specific information especially when judicial notice had
been taken of the viralled news item and concrete material should have
been placed before us as reply to our query.
11.     We, accordingly, direct that the District Magistrate, Meerut shall
hold a comprehensive investigation into the matter and will submit
report to the Court again by personally appearing online on the next
date fixed.
12.   Sri S.V. Raju, learned Additional Solicitor General of India
submitted that oxygen supply was no more an issue in the State of U.P.
though there was some gap between demand and supply but the gap
was not so significant that any patient would die for want of oxygen.
Besides that, he submitted that oxygen generation/ production has
already started in the State and supply was continuous. He further
submitted that as far as the disposal of the confiscated articles like life
saving drugs Remdesivir injection, oxygen cylinders and oxmeters
were concerned, the concerned Magistrate was himself sufficiently
empowered to pass order immediately under Section 451 and 457 of
Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973. In this regard, he drew our attention
towards the judgment of the Supreme Court in the case of Sunderbhai
Ambalal Desai v. State of Gujarat reported in 2002 (10) SCC 283.
13.   Thus, he argued that all the concerned Magistrates, before whom
the case was going on in relation to the seized case properties like life
saving drugs Remdesivir as well as oxygen cylinders and oximeters
and such other related seized articles could exercise powers vested
under Section 451 Cr.P.C. expeditiously and police was required to
approach learned Magistrates under Section 457 Cr.P.C. for immediate
disposal of such seized articles.
14.   Accordingly, we hereby direct to              all the concerned
Magistrates in the entire State of Uttar Pradesh to immediately
dispose of the case properties like life saving drugs namely
Remdesivir, Oxygen        cylinders and oximeters and such other
related articles within a week of the case being instituted before
them. We also direct the Director General of Police to immediately
issue advisory to all the Senior Superintendents/ Superintendents
of Police in the State to direct the concerned police officers who
have seized or would seize in future such articles from illegal
possessions, to immediately within 24 hours of such seizure,
approach concerned Magistrates for the disposal of such property
and in the event they approach the concerned Magistrate, he shall
dispose of the case properties exercising power under Section 457
Cr.P.C. within three days thereafter in view of the current
pandemic caused by Covid-19.
15.   Now coming to the issue of non-compliance of undertaking
given before the Supreme Court in Special Leave Petition (Civil) Diary
No.(s) 10698 of 2021, we notice that in the affidavit filed on behalf of
the State Election Commission certain photographs of the counting
centres have been annexed and some of the CCTV clips compressed in
a Pen Drive have also been provided along with the affidavit. Sri Tarun
Agrawal, learned counsel appearing for the State Election Commission
submitted that reports from majority of the Nodal Officers were still
awaited regarding compliance of the Covid protocol as per the
undertakings given to the Supreme Court. He has further argued that
regarding deaths of the polling officers and agents during the polling,
77 deaths have come to be reported so far from 28 districts and reports
from other districts were still awaited. He submitted that he would
come with all the reports within next one week. However, at the same
time he submitted that the State Government had decided to give
compensation of Rs.30,00,000/- to the family members of the deceased
polling officers and in that regard he has brought on record the State
Government policy vide Annexure-4 to the affidavit.
16.   On the question of role of the State Election Commission in
conducting the elections more particularly in the face of current
pandemic, learned counsel for the State Election Commission has
sought time till next Tuesday to study the matter and to address the
Court on the said issue.
17.   On the question of availability of vaccine, proposed expenditure
and the steps taken in the face of the fact that threat of third waive of
Covid-19 pandemic looms large and how much vaccines were
available, Sri S.P. Singh, learned Additional Solicitor General of India
informed the Court that the available vaccine in the make of Covaxin
and Covishield were available to the tune of 8.5 crores for the month
of May, 2021. He further submitted that Central Government had the
necessary budget as per the announcement made in the Parliament by
the Finance Minister to the tune Rs.35,000 crores to spend on Covid-19
vaccines. According to him, the Central Government was intending to
procure vaccines from other vaccine producers also and for this
purpose the conditions in the guidelines for the license qua emergency
use of vaccines had also been relaxed. He submitted that 1.5 lacs
Sputnik Covid vaccines had already arrived in India from Russia till
18.    Since Sri S.P. Singh made a statement that now the vaccines
were available in the global market and anybody could purchase it, we
also put a query to Sri Manish Goyal, learned Additional Advocate
General as well as Sri S.V. Raju, learned Additional Solicitor General
of India appearing for State of U.P. as to what was the stand of State of
Uttar Pradesh in the above regard. They made statements that the
Government had already floated global tenders for the said purpose.
19.    We are of the opinion that tender is a long drawn process and if
we run late in vaccinating large number of population in the State, we
may lose the real desired result of vaccination as the virus may achieve
such mutations which may neutralize the vaccine also. Besides that
since large number of people are getting infected every day and the
Scientists are of the view that third waive is almost at the door steps of
India, it is necessary that Government should enter into direct dialogue
with vaccine producers with the help of Indian Diplomats in those
countries. We must remember that in the context of Covid-19 virus
unless every individual is protected, no one is safe.
20.    We, accordingly, direct the State Government to find ways
and means to ensure immediate procurement of vaccines so that all
in Uttar Pradesh may get vaccinated with its complete doses within
3-4 months time and tell us on the next date fixed how it proposes
to expedite purchase of vaccines from global market.
21.    Sri Rajat Rajan Singh, learned Advocate has moved an
intervention application in which it has been pleaded that Government
must come up with specific policy to vaccinate physically challenged
persons. Sri Rajat Rajan Singh, who also appeared through video
conferencing has drawn the attention of the Court to the guidelines
issued by the World Health Organization for disability considerations
in respect of physically challenged persons during        the Covid-19
outbreak and submitted that it is quite unfortunate that till date in the
entire vaccination programme undertaken by the State Government it
was not provided as to what were the guidelines for vaccination
specific to the physically challenged persons.
22.    We find merit in the argument advanced by Sri Rajat Rajan
Singh and direct him to supply a copy of the petition to the learned
Additional     Advocate General as well         as learned Additional
Solicitor General of India so that on the next date fixed both the
Advocates may place before the Court the guidelines prepared for
vaccination programme specific to the physically challenged
23.    Sri Anuj Singh, learned Advocate, who has appeared through
video conferencing has brought to the notice of the Court that the surge
of pandemic was now being seen in rural areas also and the situation
had alarmingly worsened for want of proper medical care. He has also
argued that in those districts where medical health infrastructure was
weak, a large number of deaths were reported but since the
concentration of the Government in the recent past had been towards
the major cities, the smaller districts and cities got unfortunately
ignored and also did not get the attention of media.
24.   We, accordingly, direct the Additional Advocate General to
apprise us on the next date fixed as to how the State Government
was dealing with the surge of pandemic in rural and sub-urban
areas and smaller cities of the State.
25.   Put up this matter again on 11th May, 2021 at 11:00 am.
26.   A copy of this order is directed to be communicated to
Additional Chief Secretory (Home) and Director General of Police,
U.P. as well as the Secretary (Law) State of U.P. within 24 hours.
