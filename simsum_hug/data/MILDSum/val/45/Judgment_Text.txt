This application is filed u/s 439 of the Code of Criminal
Procedure seeking regular bail.
2.      The applicant is the sole accused in Crime No.35/2023
of Kothamangalam Police Station. The offences alleged are
punishable under Sections 354, 354A of Indian Penal Code,
Sections 9(I)(n) read with 10,            6 read with 5(I)(n) of the
Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act.
3.      The prosecution case, in short, is that, on 02.05.2017,
05.05.2017 and 07.05.2017, the applicant sexually assaulted the
victim who was then a minor and thereby committed the offences.
4.      I have heard Sri. Navaneeth N. Nath, the learned
counsel for the applicant and Sri. V.S Sreejith, the learned Public
Prosecutor. Perused the case diary.
5.      The learned counsel for the applicant submitted that
the applicant is innocent and has been falsely implicated in the
present case. The counsel further submitted that no materials are
on record to connect the applicant with the alleged crime; hence,
B.A No. 1883 of 2023
he is entitled to get bail. On the other hand, the learned Public
Prosecutor submitted that the alleged incident occurred as a part
of the intentional criminal acts of the applicant, and he is not
entitled to bail at this stage.
6.      The applicant was remanded to judicial custody on
03.02.2023. The victim is the sister-in-law of the applicant. The
marriage of the applicant with the sister of the victim was
solemnized on 24.03.2016.         According to the victim, while her
sister was hospitalized in connection with the delivery, the
applicant sexually assaulted her at her house on three occasions.
The victim gave a complaint to the police for the first time on
29.12.2022, that is about more than five years after the alleged
incident.       A crime was registered against the applicant on the
complaint of the victim as Crime No. 2139/2022 on 22.12.2022.
The offence alleged in the said crime was under Sections 324 and
354 of Indian Penal Code. Annexure-A3 is the FIS given by the
victim in the said crime. I went through Annexure-A3. There is
absolutely no allegation of rape alleged to have been taken place
in the year 2017. It appears that on the next day, a crime was
registered against the victim on the complaint of the applicant for
B.A No. 1883 of 2023
the offence punishable under Section 326 of Indian Penal Code as
Crime No. 2148/2022.         The copy of the FIR is Annexure-A4.     It
was thereafter, on 29.12.2022, the applicant gave a statement to
the police in Crime No.2139/2022 raising the present allegations.
All these sequence of events give rise to doubt as to the
fabrication of the prosecution case. It is true that, the petitioner
is a habitual offender and he is involved in another ten cases.
However, considering the fact that the prosecution version is
doubtful and the applicant has been in custody for the last more
than 35 days, I am inclined to grant bail to the applicant. Hence,
the applicant is entitled to be released on bail.
In the result, the application is allowed on the following
(i)     The applicant shall be released on bail on executing a
bond for Rs.1,00,000/- (Rupees One lakh only) with two solvent
sureties for the like sum each to the satisfaction of the
(ii)    The  applicant   shall   fully  co-operate  with   the
(iii)   The applicant shall appear before the investigating
B.A No. 1883 of 2023
officer between 10.00 a.m and 11.00 a.m. every Saturday until
further orders. He shall also appear before the investigating officer
as and when required.
(iv)    The applicant shall not commit any offence of a like
nature while on bail.
(v)     The applicant shall not attempt to contact any of the
prosecution witnesses, directly or through any other person, or in
any other way try to tamper with the evidence or influence any
witnesses or other persons related to the investigation.
(vi)    The applicant shall not leave the State of Kerala
without the permission of the trial Court.
(vii) The application, if any, for deletion/modification of the
bail conditions or cancellation of bail on the grounds of violating
the bail conditions shall be filed at the jurisdictional court.
