1.           The prayer in this petition is for quashing of complaint
bearing No. 95/Comp. titled "Deeksha Sharma vs. Nikhil Mahajan &
ors" pending before learned Chief Judicial Magistrate Reasi ( for short
‘Trial Court’) and also the order dated 05.03.2020 ( for short ‘impugned
order’) by virtue of which Trial Court has taken cognizance and has issued
process to the petitioners.
2.            The brief facts of the case are that the petitioner No.1 is the
father, petitioner No. 2 is the mother and petitioner No. 3 is the sister of the
pro-forma respondent no. 2, and the profroma respondent No. 2 is the
husband of the respondent No. 1 whose marriage was solemnized on
04.05.2017. The respondent No. 1 soon after the marriage was having
matrimonial discord with the proforma respondent No. 2, she left her
matrimonial house and went to her parental house, whereas the proforma
respondent No. 2 is stated to have also left the house whose whereabouts of
are not known to the petitioners. A case under Protection of Women
against Domestic Violence Act (for short ‘the Act’) has been filed by the
respondent No. 1 against the proforma respondent No. 2 and in the said
petition the petitioners are respondents. It is stated that petitioner No. 3 is
the daughter of the petitioner No. 1 and is married and living with her
husband at her matrimonial home. It is stated that during the pendency of
the aforesaid complaint the respondent No. 1 in order to humiliate and
harass the petitioners herein filed another complaint under sections 494,
109, 114, 120-B of Indian Penal Code against the petitioners as well as
profroma respondents before the Trial Court and the Trial Court vide
impugned order dated 05.03.2020 took cognizance in the aforesaid
complaint and issued process against the petitioners.
3.           The complaint and impugned order dated 10.11.2021 has been
called in question and is sought to be quashed, in this petition precisely, on
the following grounds:-
(a) That the impugned complaint as well as consequent order
dated 05.03.2020 is an abuse of process of law, therefore,
same are required to be quashed;
(b) That perusal of the complaint, more specifically Para no. 7
of the complaint the complainant /respondent no. t has
stated that the profroma respondent no. 2 has contracted a
second marriage during the subsistence of the earlier
marriage somewhere in the month of May, 2018, meaning
thereby that the factum of the marriage is still unknown to
the respondent no. 1 and merely on the basis of a birth
certificate of a child the respondent no. 1 is alleging the
same, therefore, from the perusal of the complaint the
complainant have stated that the proforma respondent No.
2 has contracted the marriage as per Hindu rites and
customs at Jammu, however, prima facie nothing has been
placed on record by the respondent no. 1, so as to make
out a case for taking cognizance and issuing summons
against the petitioners;
(c) That nothing has been placed on record by the respondent
No. 1 so as to make out a case for taking cognizance and
issuing summons against the petitioners;
(d) That the complaint and the consequent order dated
05.03.2020 is required to be quashed on the ground, that
the Trial Court lacks the jurisdiction for entertaining the
same. It is stated that section 177 of Code of Criminal
Procedure lays down the jurisdiction of the Court to try an
offence in the terms that every offence shall ordinarily be
enquired into and tried by the Court within locals limits of
whose jurisdiction the same was committed;
(e) That the Trial Court below while taking cognizance has
committed an error, inasmuch as the Trial in para no. 3 of
the   impugned     order   has   specifically stated    that
"photographs of marriage and date of birth certificate of
child alleged to have been born" is also annexed with the
complaint, however, it is stated that the complainant/the
respondent no. 1 has annexed the photographs of her
marriage with the proforma respondent no. 2 and the Trial
Court without appreciating this fact has taken cognizance
of the matter and has issued summons to the petitioners.
(f) That the Trial Court has taken cognizance in respect of the
offences punishable under Section 494 read with Sections
109 and 120 IPC against the petitioners, however, the fact
remains that the petitioners cannot be            criminally
prosecuted for the same as the Section 494 particularly
provides that the offence there under is committed by the
either spouse, who remarries during the subsistence of a
legal and a valid marriage, whereas, in the present case
the cognizance against the petitioners has been taken for
commission of the offences under section 494 lPC which is
legally not permissible;
4.            Respondent No. 1 has filed objections, wherein it is stated that
she has filed a criminal complaint against the petitioners and the proforma
respondents alleging therein that she is the legally wedded wife of the
proforma respondent No. 2 whose marriage was solemnized on 4th of May
2017, as per Hindu rites and Ceremonies, out of the said wedlock a male
child was born, despite the said fact, the proforma respondent No. 2 has
solemnized second marriage with the respondent No. 3. It is stated that the
proforma respondent No. 2 has solemnized second marriage with the
respondent No. 3 and out of the said wedlock a male child was born and in
order to substantiate the said fact she has placed on record the birth
certificate of the child issued by South Delhi Municipal Corporation on
20.09.2019. In the objections, it is further stated that in the complaint she
has made specific allegations that the proforma respondents in connivance
with the petitioners herein solemnized second marriage despite the fact that
the first marriage with the answering respondent was subsisting at the time
of solemnizing the second marriage.
5.           Heard learned counsel for the parties and perused the record
on file.
6.           The impugned order dated 05.03.2020 passed by the Trial
Court reads as under:-
The assertions highlighted in the complaint as also
material available on record prima facie indicate that
complainant is wife of accused No. l; that her marriage
with accused No. 1 still subsists; that during subsistence of
this marriage, accused No. 1 contracted second marriage
with accused No. 2 out of which a male child is born
whose date of birth is 04.02.2019 as per certificate issued
by South Delhi Municipal corporation; that accused No. 3
to 9 actively facilitated second marriage inter-se accused
No. I & 2 despite knowing the fact that marriage between
complainant and accused No. 1 still subsists. Prima-facie
there are amply justifiable grounds to proceed against
accused for offences under Sections 494, 109, 114, 120-B
IPC therefore, cognizance of the said offences is taken and
process is directed to be issued against accused requiring
their appearance in this Court on next date of hearing so
that matter can be proceeded further in accordance with
law ordained by Code of Criminal Procedure.”
7.          A perusal of the record tends to show that the complainant-
respondent No. 1 claiming herself to be legally wedded wife of respondent
No. 2 filed a complaint under Sections 494, 109, 114, 120-8 IPC before the
Trial Court against the petitioners. She alleged that right from the
beginning of marriage the proforma respondent No. 2 herein and his family
members started harassing her for bringing dowry, when she conceived
child the proforma respondent No. 2 and his family members made several
attempts to abort her fetus and on her refusal she was thrown out of the
matrimonial house. In the complaint it was alleged that proforma
respondent No. 2 -Nikhil Mahajan with the connivance of petitioners has
contracted second marriage with proforma respondent No. 3- Ananya
Wadhera somewhere in the month of May 2018, during the subsistence of
the first marriage and from the second marriage a male child has born on
04.02.2019 to the proforma respondent Nos. 2 and 3.
8.            Learned counsel for the petitioners submits that complaint and
the consequent impugned order dated 05.03.2020 is required to be quashed
as the trial Court lacks jurisdiction to entertain the same.
9.            On the other hand, learned counsel for the respondent No. 1
submits that respondent No. 1 is permanently residing with her parents at
Reasi, therefore, the Court at Reasi has the jurisdiction to entertain the
present complaint.
10.           It would be appropriate and advantageous herein to refer to
the judgment of this Court rendered in case titled S. Karan Singh Sodhi
and others vs. Jatender Jeet Kour, reported in 2007 (2) JKJ 566, wherein
this Court has held as follows:-
“The question is which marriage constitute the offence
punishable under Section 494, R.P.C. In terms of Section
494, R.P.C. performing/contracting the second marriage
during the subsistence of first valid marriage is the
offence. The Court within whose jurisdiction, the second
marriage is performed is having the jurisdiction to try the
case in terms of Section 177 of Criminal Procedure Code
(in short "the Code"). This provision of law lays down the
general principles as regards the jurisdiction of the
Court. Every offence shall ordinarily be enquired into
and tried by a Court within the local limits of whose
jurisdiction it was committed. Admittedly offence
under Section 494, R.P.C. is the second marriage. As
discussed herein above the second marriage has been
contracted at Baramulla, as alleged. Thus, Baramulla
Court is having the jurisdiction to try the complaint.
11.          The Apex Court in a case titled as Trisuns Chemical Industry
v. Rajesh Agarwal , reported in 1999(4) RCR (Criminal) 223 (SC) held
that any Magistrate can take cognizance whether it has the jurisdiction or
not but enquiry of trial is to be conducted by the Magistrate having
jurisdiction. It is profitable to reproduce para No. 12 of the judgment as
“The jurisdictional aspect becomes relevant only when
the question of enquiry or trial arises. It is therefore a
fallacious thinking that only a Magistrate having
jurisdiction to try the case has the power to take
cognizance of the offence. If he is a Magistrate of the
First Class his power to take cognizance of the offence is
not impaired by territorial restrictions. After taking
cognizance he may have to decide as to which Court has
jurisdiction to enquiry into or try the offence and that
situation would reach only during the post cognizance
stage and not earlier”
12.           In the back drop of aforesaid discussion, this Court finds that
the Chief Judicial Magistrate, Reasi is lacking jurisdiction to try the case,
as such, the impugned order taking cognizance dated 05.03.2020 in
complaint bearing No. 95/Comp. titled "Deeksha Sharma vs. Nikhil
Mahajan & ors" is quashed.
13.         Complainant-respondent No. 2 herein shall be at liberty to
approach appropriate forum for redressal of her grievance.
