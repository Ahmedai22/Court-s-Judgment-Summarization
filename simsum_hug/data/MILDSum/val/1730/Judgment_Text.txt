It is a shame that every other case we consider is
sadly a rape of a minor. A minor child was pounced upon by a
neighbour, when she was alone in her house and forcefully
molested, which is the case of the prosecution.
2.   Kum.     Sai   Pooja,    learned    Counsel   for  the
appellant,    vehemently     argued    in   defence,    claiming  the
improbability     of    the    story    and    stressing    upon  the
inconsistencies. Though in cases of rape, it is trite that a
conviction   can   be    based   on   the   sole   testimony   of the
prosecutrix; corroboration would be necessary if the evidence
is found to be not of sterling quality.          Discrepancies in the
evidence   of   the    victim,    PW1   and   her   mother,   PW9 are
specifically highlighted. The incident is portrayed as a very
violent one, but the injuries detected in medical examination
are not commensurate with the violence alleged. It has been
deposed that the victim was forcefully taken inside the room
of her house and rape was carried out with equally violent
penetration alleged. There were no visible injuries either on
the body or the genitals of the victim. The complaints of
pain noticed by the Doctor can always be pretended. As for
the evidence regarding penetration, an extract from the book
'Forensic   Medicine     for   the   Police';    by   Dr.B.Umadethan,    a
celebrated Doctor of Forensic Medicine, has been placed on
record. It is pointed out that the presence or absence of
hymen   does     not    indicate      the    virginity    of    a   woman.
Emphatically     the   statement    'Virginity     can  be   proved;   but
cannot be disproved' is pointed out. The mere finding that
there  was   a   hymen   tear   would     not  conclusively    prove   the
sexual act of penetration.
3. PW1 and PW9 have stated the time differently;
while PW9 says that the meeting which kept her away from home
was at 5 O'clock, PW1 says it to be at 4.00 p.m and the
incident   as     recorded    in    Ext.P2    certificate     of   medical
examination    is at    4.30. The      house in    which the     crime is
perpetrated     is   situated     in    a   colony   which    is   thickly
populated.     The    scene    of    occurrence     was    not    properly
identified and the description of the scene does not reveal
the  space   available;     which    is   significant   insofar    as  the
violent act of dragging the victim inside the house, throwing
her on a cot and forcefully penetrating her. The scene plan
Ext.P5   and     scene    mahazar      Ext.P6    does    not    show   the
measurements of the rooms.            It also shows only one access
into the house. The evidence of PW1 is that when her mother
came home, the accused ran away, in which event the mother
would have definitely seen the accused, to which end PW9 does
not depose. It is pointed out that while PW9, the mother
admitted   that  there   were   issues   with  the   family  of  the
accused, PW13, the father of the victim, asserted that the
accused  was   his  friend.   The   evidence  of   PW1,  the  victim
clearly shows that she was tutored and leading questions were
put to her in the chief-examination. She is said to have
failed in the 10th standard and also failed twice earlier.         A
14-year-old, who failed twice cannot be in the 10 th standard
and PW1 does not remember when she stopped her studies, a
deliberate falsehood. There is hence suppression of material
facts and PW1 is not a witness of sterling quality.              The
entire  incident   as  spoken    of  by  the  prosecutrix;   in  the
thickly populated area is prima facie unnatural. There is no
valid proof of date of birth since only a certified copy of
the birth certificate was produced and it was not marked
through the custodian of such a document.
4.   The learned Counsel would argue that the defence
was  conducted   shabbily   and   it  clearly  indicates   that  the
accused did not have proper legal aid. Reliance is placed on
Varghese @ Biju v. State of Kerala, 2007 (2) KHC 310 to urge
a  remand.   Ganesan   v.  State    represented   by   Inspector  of
Police, (2020) 10 SCC 573 is placed reliance on to urge this
Court   to   seek    corroboration     to   the   testimony    of  the
prosecutrix, who is not credible. Santosh Prasad @ Santosh
Kumar v. State of Bihar, (2020) 3 SCC 443 is also relied upon
to seek acquittal of the accused. The learned Counsel also
valiantly sought for mitigation in the sentence, even if the
conviction is affirmed; since doubt lingers on all counts.
5.    The   learned   Public   Prosecutor   Smt.Bindu   O.V.
argued for sustaining the impugned judgment. It is pointed
out  that   PW9   has   produced   Ext.P9  certificate    of  date  of
birth, which is the certified copy of a public document. The
evidence of the Headmaster (HM) (PW5) further corroborates
the date of birth and establishes the child victim to be only
14  years   of   age   when  the  alleged    incident   occurred.  The
evidence of PW1 is amply corroborated by that of the Doctor
and  the   certificate     of  examination     produced,   Ext.P2.  It
clearly indicates the history of the incident, which is in
tune with the FIS and the deposition of PW1 before court. The
trial court has seen the demeanour of the witness, assessed
her conduct and found her to be competent. The trial court
was abundantly careful in recording the chief-examination, as
question and answer and none of them are leading questions.
The   prosecutrix     without   any   deviation,    braved   searching
cross-examination      and   stood   her   ground.    The   suggestive
questions put to the victim in cross-examination indirectly
is an admission of the incident having occurred. The accused
had pounced on the victim knowing very well that there would
be no person available in the house. The alleged incident
would not necessarily cause any bodily injury as such. The
absence of bodily injury cannot be the sole ground for an
acquittal and in any event, the victim has complained of body
pain as is evident from the deposition of the Doctor. Johny
C. v. State of Kerala, 2021 (4) KHC 296 is relied on to argue
that the mother, immediately after the incident heard about
the rape and the perpetrator from the victim, which can be
treated as res gestae under Sec.6 of the Evidence Act.
6.   We would first deal with the contention raised
relying upon Varghese @ Biju (supra) regarding no effective
legal aid having been received. A reading of the decision
would indicate that in the cited case, the Legal Aid Counsel
only had four years of experience and on the very next day of
his   engagement,   he   was required   to cross-examine  the
important witnesses. There are no such facts brought before
this Court on which alone there could be prejudice found by
this Court; as has been found in the cited case. The learned
Counsel, would emphasize how the case was conducted, to seek
for a remand. We are however not inclined to so remand a
matter merely for the reason of the defence having not been
conducted    properly.   We   also   notice   that  but   for  the
suggestion put in cross-examination, which tends to be an
indirect admission, there is no inefficiency discernible in
the  defence   set-up.   In  fact,   Ganesan  (supra)   found that
merely because an appeal is disposed of within four days, it
cannot be presumed that there was no fair and sufficient
opportunity given to the accused to defend himself. In the
present case, there is not even a ground urged of prejudice.
7.   PW1, the victim deposed in tandem with the FIS
given by her. We see that the court has recorded the chief-
examination as questions and answers. But however, we do not
find them to be leading questions. The prosecutrix deposed
that on 04.05.2014 at around 5.00 p.m she was alone at her
residence when her father's friend trespassed into her house
and closed the door at the entrance. He removed his dress,
caught hold of her and forcefully removed her churidar-pants.
When she protested and tried to raise an alarm, the accused
covered her mouth with his hand and caught her breasts. He
threatened    to   cut   off   her    breasts   and   removed  her
undergarment. The victim was then forcefully made to lie on
the cot and subjected to penetrative sexual assault. After
the incident, she cried and when her mother came home, the
accused  fled the    scene. The    victim was   also told   by the
accused not to divulge the incident to anybody. However, she
spoke to her mother about the molestation and later on; the
next day, Ext.P1 FIS was registered. She also spoke about
having been examined at the Taluk Head Quarters Hospital,
Vythiri and having surrendered MO1 to MO3 dresses before the
I.O.  She  spoke   of   her   date  of   birth   as  14.03.1999.   She
withstood searching cross-examination and no inconsistency as
such could be brought out. In fact, there was a more graphic
description   of  the   incident,    on   the   suggestions   made  in
cross. She also explained how the accused stifled her cries,
physically    and    by     threats    levelled,     negativing    any
possibility of the nearby residents coming to her rescue.
8. PW2   is    a  neighbour   who   went   along  with  the
mother to the Kudumbasree meeting. She had different versions
about how she came to know of what happened to PW1. We do not
place any reliance on that part of her evidence. PW9, the
mother of the victim, spoke in tandem with what the victim
said. She had been away for the Kudumbasree meeting, which at
least receives corroboration from PW2, who was also present
at  the  meeting.   When     she  returned   and   saw   her  daughter
crying, she enquired the reason with her daughter. Though she
did not immediately say anything, later the victim disclosed
what transpired in the absence of the mother. On the next
day, they went to the Vanitha Helpline at Kalpetta to make
the  complaint.   PW9    also   affirmed   that   the   birth  of  her
daughter was registered and a birth certificate, the original
of which was with her, was produced. The same was marked as
Ext.P9, which indicates the date of birth to be 14.03.1999.
The original after perusal by the Court was given back and a
copy placed in evidence.    PW13 is the father, who was away on
work. He was working at a slightly distant place, in a hotel.
He confirmed that PW1 was alone in the house, since his wife
had gone for the Kudumbasree meeting and his elder daughter
was away at Palakkad. This fact was spoken of by PW1, PW2 and
PW9 also. He was informed over the telephone about the rape
committed on his daughter at around 9.00 clock at night and
the next day morning he came home, after which the complaint
was made.
9.   We do not find any inconsistency in the evidence
of PW1 and PW9 as to the time. PW1, in her cross-examination
had only said that her mother had left for the Kudumbasree
meeting at around 4 o'clock and PW9 spoke of her having gone
for a meeting at around 5 o'clock. We do not think that the
witnesses should be pinned down to the exact time and it is
highly unlikely that every routine would be carried out by an
individual looking at a clock. That the house was empty on
the  evening of    the crucial    day and   that the  offence was
committed   between   4  to  5  p.m   is  fairly  clear  from  the
evidence   of  PW1   and  PW9.   The   learned  Counsel  has  also
stressed the fact that, while PW9 speaks of some issues with
the family of the accused, PW13 spoke of the accused being a
friend. PW1 also deposed that she was acquainted with the
accused since he and her father were friends. The attempt of
the defence obviously was to allege a motive for raising a
false allegation against the accused by the family of the
victim.  It   is  only   natural  that  even  between   friends  or
family, there exist certain issues. But that alone cannot
lead to such a false allegation and we find no credence in
the contention raised on that count by the accused.
10. The   learned   Government  Pleader   has  relied  on
Johny (supra) to urge res gestae under Sec.6. Parbati Devi v.
State, AIR 1952 SC 831 was relied on to raise the ground of
relevance under Sec.8 of the Indian Evidence Act. We would
not go into that, especially since the question put to PW9 in
chief-examination    was   a  leading  question.   PW9   in  chief-
examination, while narrating what transpired, spoke of her
daughter having not first divulged the reason for weeping.
She also said that, it was only later, when she persisted,
the   girl   came    out   with   the   specific   allegation    of
molestation. The prosecution before the trial court put a
question as to whether PW1 had stated about the molestation
when enquiries were made with her, to which an affirmative
answer was given. We would not place any reliance on the same
and in that circumstance, we would not also consider the
contention raised under Sec.6 and 8 of the Evidence Act.
11. PW3 is the Doctor who examined the victim at
7.45 p.m on 05.05.2014, the very next day. The certificate
issued was marked as Ext.P2. The history relating to the
incident is recorded as 'alleged H/O sexual assault by Balan
(Mani  Balan)   on  4.5.2014    at  abound  4.30  p.m …'  at the
victim's residence. The details of position and degree of
violence were also recorded. The victim was pinned down by
the assailant and her panties and pants removed, after which
penetration   with  the   penis  was  attempted.  The victim was
unable to give any resistance since the accused was lying
over her. The victim also stated that she was having pain
while urinating and she had washed her genitals after the
incident. Vaginal swabs, vaginal smears, nail clippings, hair
samples, etc. were taken. On examination, her hymen was found
to be torn at 7 o'clock position, but there were no injuries
on the vagina. According to the Doctor, there was evidence of
vaginal penetration since the hymen is torn at the 7 o'clock
position and the vagina admits one finger loosely and two
fingers tightly. The history of the incident as recorded in
Ext.P2   corroborates    the  FIS   and  the  deposition  of the
prosecutrix. It is argued by the learned Counsel, Ext.P17 FSL
report does not reveal any evidence of sexual intercourse,
which normally leaves remnants for about 72 hours. This by
itself cannot be conclusive to find no penetration. In the
light of the credible and consistent evidence spoken of by
the victim, which is in tune with the FIS and the history
reported to the Doctor, we find no reason to interfere with
the   finding    of   the   trial    court   that   there   was   actual
penetration and rape was committed.
12. The     learned    Counsel   has  placed   before   us  an
authoritative text by a celebrated Forensic Specialist, which
indicates that even the presence or absence of hymen does not
disprove virginity conclusively. We should understand that if
the   hymen   is    present   and    does   not   reveal   any   injury,
virginity stands proved, but not otherwise. In the present
case,   the  virginity     is   not   proved   and   coupled   with  the
evidence of the prosecutrix, with sufficient corroboration
from other witnesses, we are inclined to find the molestation
having occurred as spoken of by the prosecutrix.
13. The     age   of   the   victim   is   proved   by  Ext.P9
certificate of birth issued by the Registrar of Births &
Deaths, though the same was not produced before the I.O. PW9,
the mother produced it from her custody before court when she
was   examined.     The   date    of   birth   as   seen   from   Ext.P9
certificate is 14.03.1999. The Register of Births and Deaths
is  a   public    document    as   provided   under    Sec.74   and  the
certified copy of the public document is one issued under
Sec.76. There is a presumption insofar as the genuineness of
the certified copies so declared to be admissible as evidence
of any particular fact, duly certified, interalia, by a State
Government Officer. We rely on the judgment of a Division
Bench in Rajan v. State of Kerala, 2021 (4) KLT 274. We do
not find any reason to doubt the certified copy nor is it
inadmissible    in    evidence.     Though   no   corroboration   is
necessary, the HM, PW5, produced the extract of the School
register as Ext.P4, which also confirms the date of birth as
spoken of by PW1, PW9 and revealed from Ext.P9. Significantly
the mother of the victim also spoke of her age.
14. The official witnesses, including the I.O, have
spoken   of  their   role   in   the  investigation,   on  which  no
dispute is raised. The scene plan is marked as Ext.P5 and the
scene mahazar as Ext.P6. The residence of PW1 is a small one
and has an asbestos roof. True, the description of the rooms
are not given, but that is not a reason to assume that the
alleged actions could not have been committed in the house.
The  allegation   is   also   that   the  accused  had  entered  the
house, closed the door at the entrance and then molested the
victim. She is also said to have been dragged to the bed
where she was forced to lie down. We do not think there are
any spatial constraints in the house, normally habituated by
four persons, the victim, her parents and her elder sister,
all of whom, except the victim, were away at the time when
the incident occurred.
15. We    find     no   reason   to   interfere    with   the
conviction entered under Sec.376(2)(i) of IPC and Sec.450 of
IPC.  There   is   ample    evidence    to  find   rape   having   been
committed on the victim, who has also been proved to be below
the age of 16 years. As far as the conviction under Sec.5(i)
read with Sec.6, we agree with the learned Counsel for the
appellant   that   there   is   no   aggravated   penetrative    sexual
assault. No separate sentence was awarded under the POCSO Act
by the trial court noticing Sec.42 of the Act because of the
sentence   imposed     under     Sec.376(2)(i)    of    the   IPC.   An
aggravated penetrative sexual assault arises interalia when
it is committed on a child below 12 years. In the present
case,  the   child   is   14   years   and  hence   there   can  be  no
conviction   under   Sec.5(m).     The   charge  seems   to   be  under
Sec.5(i). However, there is no grievous hurt, bodily harm or
injury on the body of the child or to the sexual organs. Be
that  as  it   may,   the   accused    is  found  to   have   committed
penetrative sexual assault under Sec.3, a lesser offence, for
which the punishment varies from 10 years to imprisonment for
life. We do not think that we should impose any sentence
separately,   especially      since   the  Sessions    Court   has  not
imposed it by virtue of Sec.42 and the sentence imposed under
Sec.376(2)(i).   We   hence set  aside  the   conviction under
Sec.5(i) read with Sec.6 of the POCSO Act and confirm the
conviction under Sec.376(2)(i) and Sec.450 of the IPC. The
accused is also found guilty of the offence under Sec.3 read
with Sec.4 of the POCSO Act, 2012. The sentence imposed by
the Court below is affirmed in toto. The appeal hence stands
partly allowed.
