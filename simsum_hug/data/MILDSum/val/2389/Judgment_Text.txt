2.          This appeal challenges the judgment and order dated
29.9.2021 passed by the High Court of Karnataka at Bengaluru,
dismissing Writ Petition No. 53944/2016 (GM-Res) preferred by
the appellant herein. Said writ petition had prayed, inter alia, for
following reliefs: -
(A)  “Issue appropriate writs, orders or directions
Digitally signed by
directing the Respondents to produce mercy files
Reason:                       pertaining to the Petitioner, all the relevant papers

from prison from the date of his arrest.
(C)  Issue appropriate writs, orders or directions and in

- F.No.14/1/2011-Judicial Cell, Annexure N hereto)
pursuant to the rejection of his mercy petition by the
office of the Hon’ble President of India is
unconstitutional and bad in law.
(D) Issue appropriate writs, orders or directions

(F)  Declare that the decision of the office of the Hon’ble
Governor of Karnataka rejecting the mercy petition

and (B) to the Petitioner;
(J)  Issue any such other writs, orders and directions as
this Hon’ble Court deems fit in the facts and
circumstances of the case in the interest of justice
and equity.
3.   The basic facts leading to the filing of said Writ Petition are
(a)    One Jayashri, wife of Maradi Subbaiah was found
raped and murdered in her home on 28.02.1998, which
led to the registration of Crime No. 108/1998 with
Division, Bengaluru City. The appellant was arrested
in connection with said crime on 2.3.1998 and has
been in custody since then. After due investigation, the
appellant was tried in Sessions Case No. 725/1999 on
the file of Sessions Judge, Fast Track Court-VII,
Bengaluru for having committed offences punishable
under Sections 302, 376 and 392 of the Indian Penal
(b)    By its judgment dated 26.10.2006, the trial Court
convicted the appellant for the aforesaid offences and
by order dated 27.10.2006, awarded punishment of
death sentence, subject to confirmation by the High
Court. The appellant was immediately transferred to
Belgaum    Central   Prison   and   according   to   the
appellant, he was kept in solitary confinement.
(c)      Case for confirmation of death sentence was registered
as Criminal Reference No. 3/2006 before the High
Court. The appellant also filed Criminal Appeal No.
2408/2006 challenging his conviction. The matter was
heard by a Bench of two Judges, which confirmed the
order of conviction, but disagreed on the sentence to be
imposed. While Mr. Justice V.G. Sabhahit confirmed
the award of death sentence, Mr. Justice R.B. Naik
commuted the death sentence to life imprisonment.
(d)      The matter was therefore referred to the third Judge
i.e., Mr. Justice S.R. Bannurmath on the issue of
sentence, who affirmed the award of death sentence by
his judgment dated 18.2.2009.
(e)      The matter was carried further by the appellant by
filing Criminal Appeal Nos. 285-286/2011 before this
Court, which were dismissed by this Court vide order
dated 1.2.20112, affirming the appellant’s conviction
and sentence of death imposed upon him.
B.A. Umesh v. High Court of Karnataka, (2011) 3 SCC 85.
(f) According to the procedure governing petitions for
mercy in death sentence cases, a death convict can
prefer a petition for mercy within seven (7) days after
the dismissal of his appeal by this Court or rejection of
application for special leave to appeal. The relevant
instructions in that behalf read as under: -
“I.    A convict under sentence of death shall be
allowed, if he has not already submitted a petition
for mercy, for the preparation and submission of a
petition for mercy, seven days after, and exclusive of,
the date on which the Superintendent of Jail informs
him of the dismissal by the Supreme Court of his
appeal or of his application for special leave to
appeal to the Supreme Court.
Provided that in cases where no appeal to the
Supreme Court, has been preferred or no application
for special leave to appeal to the Supreme Court has
been lodged, the said period of seven days shall be
computed from the date next after the date on which
the period allowed for an appeal to the Supreme
Court or for lodging an application for special leave
to appeal to the Supreme Court expires.
(g) Having been informed about his right to file a mercy
petition as per procedure, the appellant preferred a
petition seeking mercy on 8.2.2011, i.e., within seven
days.     The appellant also preferred Review Petition
against the decision dated 1.2.2011 passed by this
Court. Around the same time, Writ Petition (Crl.) No.
52/2011 was preferred by the appellant in this Court
praying, inter alia, for the relief of open Court hearing
in review petition. In said writ petition, this Court by
order dated 9.3.2011, directed stay of execution of
death sentence. The Review Petition filed by the
appellant was dismissed by circulation by this Court
vide its order dated 7.9.2011.
(h)      Mercy petition preferred by the appellant was rejected
by the Hon’ble President on 12.5.2013. An intimation
in that behalf was sent vide letter dated 15.5.2013 to
the appellant.
(i)      Writ Petition (Crl.) No. 52/2011 preferred by the
appellant was decided alongwith Writ Petition (Crl.) No.
77/2014 (Mohd.        Arif  @ Ashfaq       vs. Registrar
General, Supreme Court of India & Ors.) by a
Constitution Bench of this Court vide judgment dated
2.9.20143. It was held by majority that review petitions
arising out of award of death sentence be heard in open
Court by a Bench of three Judges of this Court.
(j)     Consequently, the Review Petition which was rejected
earlier on 7.9.2011, was listed for re-hearing before a
Bench of three Judges of this Court, which by its order
dated 3.10.20164, dismissed the Review Petition and
affirmed the award of death sentence. The order stated
that on careful comparison of aggravating and
mitigating circumstances and keeping in view the
principles of law laid down by this Court, the Court was
not inclined to allow the Review Petition or modify the
order dated 1.2.2011.
(k)     Within    few   days    thereafter, Writ    Petition No.
53944/2016 was preferred by the appellant seeking
reliefs as extracted hereinabove. The High Court by its
order dated 20.10.2016, stayed execution of death
sentence imposed upon the appellant.          Thereafter,
statements of objections were preferred on behalf of the
Union of India and State of Karnataka, to which
rejoinders were filed. An application under Section 151
of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 was also preferred
to bring on record certain documents regarding
medical condition of the appellant.
4.   By its judgment and order dated 29.9.2021, the High Court
dismissed the aforesaid writ petition. After considering the
submissions advanced on behalf of the parties, the following
conclusions were arrived at by the High Court: -
“(i)  There is no excessive, unexplained, inordinate delay
attributable to the respondents in deciding the mercy
(ii)  There is no violation of the petitioner’s right under
Article 21 of the Constitution of India;
(iii) All the relevant and crucial materials required for
deciding the mercy petition were placed before His
Excellency, the Governor and His Excellency, the
President of India and nothing has been kept out of
(iv) Petitioner cannot be said to have been kept in solitary
confinement.”
5.   In the challenge raised in the instant matter, while issuing
notice, the order dated 31.1.2022 passed by this Court noted the
submissions on behalf of the appellants as under: -
“a)   Even after recording a finding that there was avoidable
delay to the extent of 550 days in disposing of the mercy
petition, the High Court did not grant any relief to the
petitioner.
b)    Going by the letter written by a Medical Officer, which
letter was not controverted, the petitioner was kept in
solitary confinement for about 11 years. Thus, the law
laid down by this Court in Sunil Batra v. Delhi
Administration & Others5 was violated.
c)   The letter written by the Medical Officer was quite clear
that because of the psychological condition, the
petitioner was unable to make any mercy petition. This
fact was also not taken into account in correct
perspective by the High Court.”
By said order, this Court also called for certain documents as
“a.  The State shall place before us the Report(s) of all the
Probation Officer(s) relating to the accused before the
next date of hearing. In case there have been more than
one Report, let all Reports be placed for the
consideration of this Court.
b.   Since the National Institute of Mental Health and Neuro
Sciences (NIMHANS) at Bengaluru, has on the earlier
occasion made psychological assessment of the
petitioner, the Director NIMHANS is directed to
constitute a suitable team for psychological evaluation
of the petitioner and send a Report before the next date
of hearing.
c.   The Jail Authorities, Belgaum Central Prison where the
petitioner is presently lodged shall render complete co-
operation in facilitating access to and due evaluation of
the petitioner in all respects.”
6.       When the matter was taken up on 21.4.2022, after noting the
submission advanced on behalf of the appellant that the appellant
had been kept in solitary confinement right from the decision of
the Sessions Court, directions were issued to the District Judge,
Belgaum to cause an inspection to be undertaken and submit a
report. The text of the order was as under: -
“The basic submissions raised on behalf of the petitioner
were recorded in the order dated 31.01.2022.
While elaborating those submissions, Dr. Yug Mohit
Chaudhry, learned advocate, has stressed the point that the
petitioner was kept in solitary confinement right from the
decision of the Sessions Court awarding him death sentence.
Our attention is invited to various documents including the
Prison Manual in support of the submission that, as the
petitioner was segregated and kept in a separate Cell, that
would amount to solitary confinement, in terms of the law
laid down in Sunil Batra Etc. vs Delhi Administration and
The submission is opposed on behalf of the State
Government and though no specific reply was filed in the
High Court controverting the basic allegations in the writ
petition, Mr. Nikhil Goel, learned AAG for the State, on
instructions, submits that video conferencing can be
arranged so that this Court can have clear knowledge about
the circumstances in which the petitioner has been lodged in
a Cell.
It is true that the Hon’ble Judges constituting the Bench
in Sunil Batra’s5 case had visited the jail premises themselves
in order to have first-hand knowledge about the conditions in
which said petitioner was lodged. We may at this stage rely
upon the local inspection to be conducted by the District
Judge, Belgaum who also holds the charge as the Chairman
of the District Legal Services Committee, Belgaum.
We therefore, direct the District Judge, Belgaum to cause
local inspection done by himself and place a report alongwith
pictures, if any, to enable us have a clear understanding of
the ground situation. The report shall concentrate on location
of the barracks in which the cells of Death Row Convicts are
situated.
It is made clear that the Cells which are close to the gallows
and are used for keeping persons about to be executed, are
different from the Cells for the Death Row Convicts.
The inspection shall cover issues whether the inmates of
the concerned cells are allowed to intermingle with fellow
prisoners, the way the meals are served to them and the
duration for which the inmates are allowed to come out of
their individual cells. These are only illustrative pointers.
What we want to gather is the typical life-style of Death Row
Convicts and how their days are spent.
Let the report be made as early as possible and latest by
The report shall be sent through electronic mode at the
following Email id.: vc2.appearance@sci.nic.in.
Let copy of this order be sent through electronic mode to
the District Judge, Belgaum.
To our specific query as to the manner in which the Mercy
Petition of the petitioner was processed, Ms. Sonia Mathur,
learned Senior Advocate appearing for Union of India has
placed the concerned file for our perusal. The Registry is
directed to make copies of the file and return the same to the
concerned advocate on record by tomorrow.”
7.   Accordingly, report dated 21.4.2022 has been placed on
record by Principal District & Sessions Judge, Belgaum alongwith
picture photograph(s) of the concerned Jail barracks and the cells.
The Report is as under: -
1. “As per the directions, I visited Central Prison, Hindalaga
at 2.15 p.m. without prior notice to the Jail Authorities.
2. The concerned barrack wherein the death convict Sri B A
Umesh is housed is on the North-Eastern side facing East in
the Central Prison Hindalga. There are six cells each
measuring 8x10 feet approximately. Each cell has a toilet in
the corner with an adequate water facility. Each of the
prisoners is given a flat mattress and they are at liberty to
have their own bedding. There is electric light in each of the
cells which can be put on at their wish and they have one
window facing towards the West. The cells are covered with
grill doors and adequate light and air is available. These six
cells are of tiled roof. Encircling the six cells, there is guard
room and another common toilet outside within the
compound. Even in the compound of the barrack, there is a
facility for washing of the clothes etc. It was informed that
prison also has R.O. Water facility which would be provided
in plastic pots.
3. Out of these six cells, five are occupied. In one of the cells,
there are four persons involved in an offence of kidnapping,
robbery, and murder. They are Siddhalingesh, Suraj, Akshay
and Jameer. In another cell, there are two occupants viz.,
Sameer and Shakib, who are involved in offence under
Section 307 of IPC. Another cell is occupied by Balu involved
in a murder case. They are all under trial prisoners.
4. The Remaining two cells are occupied by one person
each i.e, Akash Desai convicted for offence under NDPS
Act for 10 years. Southern most cell is occupied by death
convict Shri. B.A. Umesh. They informed that they are in the
said cells for the last 3 months to 8 years. The other 26 death
convicts are in other barracks including high security
barrack, women barrack and a hospital.
5. The inmates of the cell informed that they are unlocked
from the cells at about 6.00 a.m. They are allowed to wander
in the compound of the barrack. The barrack is guarded by
five guards and it was informed that they are free to wash
their clothes and take bath outside and sit under the trees in
the compound. There is also hospital block in the prison and
if necessary, they will be escorted to the hospital where there
is a Medical Officer available. Hospital also has inpatient
facilities and mini laboratory is also adjoining it. The inmates
also told me that they can talk to fellow prisoners and there
are no restrictions during daytime. The cells will be locked
again at 6.00 p.m. in the evening.
6. It is informed that breakfast is served at about 7.30 in the
morning, lunch will be served at about 11.00 a.m. and supper
would be served at 4.30 p.m. The inmates are free to consume
the supper at any time they find it convenient and they can
eat sitting together. All the inmates including Shri. B.A.
Umesh informed that the quality of food is good and
adequate. It was informed by the jail authorities that a
minimum of five guards are posted in the barrack on a
rotation basis.
7. It was also informed that in one of the cells there is a TV
fixed which may be seen by all the inmates together.
8. It was also informed that prisoners are at liberty to
purchase bakery items which are prepared by the inmates
and sold in the prison itself. It was informed that the
prisoners purchase the bakery items out of the earnings
made by them.
9. Adjoining the said barrack of six cells, on the northern
side, there is a gate leading to the gallows. There is no
separate cell meant for death convict, who would be kept in
the cell before he is taken to the gallows.
10. Thus it is observed that the cells have adequate light, air,
drinking water facilities, a common facility to view TV, and
adequate water for bathing and washing of the clothes. The
cells are enclosed in a separate compound within the prison.
They can move around the cells freely between 6.00 a.m. and
6.00 p.m.
11. The photographs and videos of the cells are attached with
this report for kind perusal.”
8.   On the subsequent date, the submissions advanced on behalf
of the appellant were discussed in the order dated 26.4.2022 as
“The Principal District and Sessions Judge, Belagavi has
placed on record his Report dated 21.04.2022. Copies of the
Report have been furnished to the parties.
Dr. Yug Mohit Chaudhry, learned advocate submits that
since the last date of hearing, the counsel for the petitioner
have had interactions with the petitioner. Dr. Chaudhry
fairly accepts that whatever is stated in the Report
corresponds to the instructions received from the petitioner
and that the Report depicts true state of affairs in the
concerned Barrack and the Cell.
He, however submits that the petitioner was kept in what
is commonly called “Andheri Block” in Belagavi Prison from
2006 to October, 2016 i.e. till stay was granted by the High
Court to the execution of death sentence. It is submitted
that there are 12 Cells in that Block and only one prisoner
is kept in a Cell; the petitioner was not allowed to get out of
his Cell at any time during the entire length of stay except
for 2 Yoga sessions which were conducted and one function
where inmates were allowed to offer prayers to Lord
Ayyappa. In his submission that was the worst period of his
stay inside the prison and the imprisonment in the Cell in
“Andheri Block” can certainly be said to be “Solitary
confinement” as described in Sunil Batra Etc. vs Delhi
Administration and Ors. Etc.5.
Dr. Chaudhry further submits that after October, 2016
till January, 2019 the petitioner was lodged in same
“Andheri Block” but was allowed to come out of the Cell
thrice a day and after January, 2019 he was shifted to the
present Barrack with respect to which the Report has been
made.
We have also had the benefit of interaction with the
concerned Jail Superintendent who is present in Court. He
has accepted that the petitioner was kept in “Andheri
Block” till January, 2019. He has also accepted that only
one inmate is kept in a cell in said “Andheri Block”. It is
however, stated that all the inmates are allowed to come out
of their cells thrice a day for the duration of 2-3 hours each.
It is submitted that they are taken out at about 6.30 A.M.
in the morning and are re-lodged after the breakfast, again
to be taken out for the purposes of lunch and supper and
are finally re-lodged around 5.00 P.M.            In sum and
substance, according to him, the inmates are allowed to
come out of their Cells for about 6 hours everyday.
It is further stated that the petitioner was shifted to the
present Barrack in January, 2019 by his predecessor and
since then the petitioner has been confined in the present
Barrack in circumstances described in the Report.
Thereafter, submissions were advanced by Mr. Nikhil
Goel, learned AAG for the State and Ms. Sonia Mathur,
learned Senior Advocate for Union of India. After conclusion
of their submissions, Dr. Chaudhry made his submissions
in rejoinder.…..”
9.   We heard Dr. Yug Mohit Chaudhry, learned advocate assisted
by Ms. Payoshi Roy, learned advocate for the appellant, Mr. Nikhil
Goel, learned Additional Advocate General for the State and
Ms. Sonia Mathur, learned Senior Advocate for Union of India.
After conclusion of submissions, the matter was reserved for
10. The parties thereafter filed written submissions and, in the
submissions filed on behalf of the appellant, the challenge has
principally been raised on two grounds: (i) delay in deciding mercy
petition and (ii) the Solitary Confinement that the appellant was
subjected to. On the first issue, following chart has been placed on

Govt. and Govt. of India
On the point of Solitary Confinement, it has been submitted:-
“31.    The Petitioner submits that he was kept in single cell
from 2006 to 2016 in a block called the Andheri Block.
During this time, he was kept for most of the day inside
the cell. The only other person he saw was the prison
guard. He was made to eat and use the toilet within his
cell and was not allowed to meet or speak to any other
inmates, to this entire duration he was allowed to
participate in a pooja and a yoga camp only in one
instance. Therefore from 2006-2016 the Petitioner was
kept in strict solitary confinement.
32.     The Petitioner concedes that after 2016 the conditions
of his incarceration were gradually relaxed and at
present, even though he is kept in a single cell, he is
allowed to mingle with other inmates in the yard during
the day.
33.    The Petitioner submits that despite having pleaded the
specific conditions of his solitary confinement till 2016
in his writ petition before the Hon’ble High Court as well
as in his SLP before this Hon’ble Court the Respondent
has not brought on record any material to the contrary.
34.    In its reply dated 9.1.2017 before the Hon'ble High
Court (SLP Pg 316-325) and before this Hon‘ble Court
the Respondent has merely stated that the Petitioner
was allowed visits to the library and canteen and
allowed visitors from time to time and hence his
incarceration did not constitute solitary confinement.
35.    That neither before the High Court nor in its affidavit in
reply before this Hon’ble Court did the Respondent aver
that the Petitioner was allowed to mingle with other
prisoners between 2006-2016. That had the Petitioner
been allowed to mingle with other prisoners, the
Respondents would have mentioned the same in their
affidavit in reply along with the fact of visits to the
library and canteen. Therefore, it is clear that the
Respondent's oral argument made before this Hon'ble
Court is nothing but an afterthought and sans any
evidentiary basis.
36.    Further, the statements made by the superintendent of
Belagum Central Prison before this Hon‘ble Court only
pertains to the conditions of incarceration after 2019,
when the Superintendent assumed his duties in
Belgaum Central Prison. These statements do not
attest to the conditions of incarceration prior to 2019.”
11. In the written submissions filed on behalf of Union of India,
it has been asserted: -
It is submitted that the Petitioner has conceded that there
is no inordinate delay on part of the Respondent No.1 in
deciding the mercy petition. It is a settled position of law that
there can be no specific time limit prescribed for deciding
mercy petitions [See, Para 41-44 of Shatrughan Chauhan
and Anr. v. Union of India and Ors.6] and only undue or
inordinate delay is what is to be looked at [See, Para 16-17,
Para 71-76 of Triveniben v. State of Gujarat7]. The time
taken for collating the information and analyzing the same
is not to be considered as undue. Further, it is also
established that there can be no absolute or unqualified rule
laid down for the purposes of determining delay in mercy
petitions and several factors are required to be taken into
account while considering the question as to whether the
death sentence should be vacated or not [See, Para 19 of
Sher Singh & Ors. v. State of Punjab8]. Every case is
required to be considered on its own facts and
circumstances.

imposition of death sentence on him is
confirmed by the Hon’ble Supreme

Respondent No.2 to Respondent No.1.
18.09.2012,    Respondent No.1 requests certain

health report of the Petitioner, to be sent
by the Respondent No. 2.

dated    18.09.2012       providing     the
12.05.2013     The Mercy Petition was rejected by the
It is submitted that the delay, if any, on part of the
Respondent No. 1 has to be calculated from 26.12.2012
[when the required information was sent to the Central
Govt.] till 12.05.2013 [when the mercy petition was finally
rejected]. This amounts to approximately 5 months, which
cannot be considered as inordinate delay. In any-event, the
Petitioner has himself conceded that the delay in
considering the mercy petition is not on account of the
Without prejudice to the above, it is further submitted that
the Petitioner did not prefer a Writ Petition till 17.10.2016
against the order of rejection of mercy petition by the Hon’ble
President that was done on 12.05.2013. This step of seeking
a judicial review of the rejection of the mercy petition was
only taken after the Review Petition was finally rejected by
the Hon’ble Supreme Court after granting a hearing in Open
Court. The Convict was protected by the stay on execution
granted by this Hon’ble Court in Writ Petition No. 52 of 2011
(B.A. Umesh v. Registrar, Supreme Court of India). The
Petitioner couldn't be placed on the same pedestal as a
convict condemned to death as he still had a judicial avenue
open and no real apprehension of execution.
It is submitted that the aspect of solitary confinement, if
any, of the Petitioner is within the purview of the State
Government/ Respondent No. 2 and therefore, no specific
submissions are being made in this regard on behalf of the
Respondent No.1. In any event, vide order dated 21.04.2022,
the Hon’ble Supreme Court had directed the District Judge,
Belgaum, to conduct a local inspection of the jail,
concentrating on the location of the barracks in which the
cells of the Death Row Convicts are situated, and place a
report before the Hon’ble Court along with pictures, if any.
In terms of the same, a report was placed before the Hon’ble
Court which clearly indicated that the Petitioner was not
placed in solitary confinement.
It is submitted that the relevant documents were duly
considered by the Hon’ble President before rejecting the
Mercy Petition of the Petitioner. The Mercy Petition was
forwarded to Respondent No.1 on 30.08.2012 for
consideration by the Hon’ble President under Article 72 of
the Constitution of India along with the relevant documents.
On 18.09.2012, Respondent No. 1 sought additional
information/documents with regard to the Medical Health
Report, details of previous criminal record and few other
aspects concerning the Petitioner [Letter dated 18.09.2012
at page 17 of the Additional Documents filed by the
Petitioner]. In response to the said letter, the required
documents/information was sent by the Respondent No. 2
vide letter dated 26.12.2012, including medical report of the
Petitioner dated 05.10.2012 [Letter dated 26.12.2012 at
page 19 of the Additional Documents filed by the
12. We now consider the first submission regarding delay in
execution of death sentence due to pendency of Mercy Petition(s).
At this stage, we may refer to the following passage from the three
Judge Bench decision of this Court in Ajay Kumar Pal v. Union
of India & Anr.9 (to which one of us was a party) which noted
some of the decisions rendered by this Court on the point:
“7. The question whether delay in execution of death
sentence can be a sufficient ground or reason for
substituting such sentence by life imprisonment has
engaged the attention of this Court over a period of time.
Some of those salient instances are:
7.1. In T.V. Vatheeswaran v. State of Tamil Nadu10, in
an appeal arising from the Judgment of the High Court
confirming the death sentence, the fact that the appellant
was awarded death sentence by the first court eight years
earlier, was noted by this Court. After referring to few earlier
cases, where such delay during the pendency of the
appellate proceedings was considered, it was observed: (SCC
pp. 78-79, paras 21-21)
"20. . . . In the United States of America where the
right to a speedy trial is a constitutionally guaranteed
right, the denial of a speedy trial has been held to
entitle an accused person to the dismissal of the
indictment or the vacation of the sentence (vide
Strunk v. United States [1973] 37 L.Ed. 56). Analogy
of American Law is not permissible, but interpreting
our Constitution sui generis, as we are bound to do,
we find no impediment in holding that the
dehumanising factor of prolonged delay in the
execution of a sentence of death has the constitutional
implication of depriving a person of his life in an
unjust, unfair and unreasonable way as to offend the
constitutional guarantee that no person shall be
deprived of his life or personal liberty except according
to procedure established by law. The appropriate relief
in such a case is to vacate the sentence of death.
21. . . . Making all reasonable allowance for the time
necessary for appeal and consideration of reprieve, we
think that delay exceeding two years in the execution
of a sentence of death should be considered sufficient
to entitle the person under sentence of death to
invoke Article 21 and demand the quashing of the
sentence of death. We therefore accept the special
leave petition, allow the appeal as also the Writ
Petition and quash the sentence of death. In the place
of the sentence of death, we substitute the sentence of
imprisonment for life."
7.2. Sher Singh and others v. State of Punjab8 was a case
where the death sentence already stood confirmed by
dismissal of appeal and review petition therefrom by this
Court. Relying on the observations in Vatheeswaran10, delay
in execution was projected as a ground in a petition
under Article 32 of the Constitution of India. Though the
Court was broadly in agreement with observations in
Vatheeswaran10 it did not agree with the statement to the
effect: (SCC p. 79, para 21)
"21. . . . that delay exceeding two years in the
execution of sentence of death should be considered
sufficient to entitle the person under sentence to death
to invoke Article 21 and demand the questioning of
the sentence of death."
However, in the context of Mercy Petitions and
exercise of power in connection thereto, it was
observed in para 23 as under: (Sher Singh Case8, SCC
"23. We must take this opportunity to impress upon
the Government of India and the State Governments
that petitions filed under Articles 72 and 161 of the
Constitution or under Sections 432 and 433 of the
Criminal Procedure Code must be disposed of
expeditiously. A self- imposed rule should be followed
by the executive authorities rigorously, that every
such petition shall be disposed of within a period of
three months from the date on which it is received.
Long and interminable delays in the disposal of these
petitions are a serious hurdle in the dispensation of
justice and indeed, such delays tend to shake the
confidence of the people in the very system of justice.
Several instances can be cited, to which the record of
this Court will bear testimony, in which petitions are
pending before the State Governments and the
Government of India for an inexplicably long period.
Undoubtedly, the executive has the power, in
appropriate cases, to act under the aforesaid
provisions but, if we may remind, all exercise of power
is preconditioned by the duty to be fair and quick.
Delay defeats justice."
7.3. The issue was settled by the Constitution Bench
decision in Triveniben v. State of Gujarat7, where it was
concluded "No fixed period of delay could be held to make
the sentence of death inexecutable ...". The scope and ambit
of exercise of jurisdiction in such cases was delineated thus
in para 22: (SCC p. 697)
"22. . . . the only jurisdiction which could be sought
to be exercised by a prisoner for infringement of his
rights can be to challenge the subsequent events after
the final judicial verdict is pronounced and it is
because of this that on the ground of long or
inordinate delay a condemned prisoner could
approach this Court and that is what has consistently
been held by this Court. But it will not be open to this
Court in exercise of jurisdiction under Article 32 to go
behind or to examine the final verdict reached by a
competent court convicting and sentencing the
condemned prisoner and even while considering the
circumstances in order to reach a conclusion as to
whether the inordinate delay coupled with subsequent
circumstances could be held to be sufficient for
coming to a conclusion that execution of the sentence
of death will not be just and proper. The nature of the
offence, circumstances in which the offence was
committed will have to be taken as found by the
competent court while finally passing the verdict. It
may also be open to the court to examine or consider
any circumstances after the final verdict was
pronounced if it is considered relevant. The question
of improvement in the conduct of the prisoner after the
final verdict also cannot be considered for coming to
the conclusion whether the sentence could be altered
on that ground also."
7.4. In Shatrughan Chauhan6 after considering law on the
point as regards delay in execution of the death sentence
and the resultant effect, as also the scope and ambit of
exercise of power, it was observed in paras 38, 41 and 42 as
under: (SCC pp. 38-39)
"44. In view of the above, we hold that undue long
delay in execution of sentence of death will entitle the
condemned prisoner to approach this Court
under Article 32. However, this Court will only
examine the circumstances surrounding the delay
that has occurred and those that have ensued after
sentence was finally confirmed by the judicial process.
This Court cannot reopen the conclusion already
reached but may consider the question of inordinate
delay to decide whether the execution of sentence
should be carried out or should be altered into
imprisonment for life.
47. It is clear that after the completion of the judicial
process, if the convict files a mercy petition to the
Governor/President, it is incumbent on the
authorities to dispose of the same expeditiously.
Though no time limit can be fixed for the Governor and
the President, it is the duty of the executive to expedite
the matter at every stage, viz., calling for the records,
orders and documents filed in the court, preparation
of the note for approval of the Minister concerned, and
the ultimate decision of the constitutional authorities.
This court, in Triveniben7, further held that in doing
so, if it is established that there was prolonged delay
in the execution of death sentence, it is an important
and relevant consideration for determining whether
the sentence should be allowed to be executed or not.
48. Accordingly, if there is undue, unexplained and
inordinate delay in execution due to pendency of
mercy petitions or the executive as well as the
constitutional authorities have failed to take note
of/consider the relevant aspects, this Court is well
within its powers under Article 32 to hear the
grievance of the convict and commute the death
sentence into life imprisonment on this ground alone
however, only after satisfying that the delay was not
caused at the instance of the accused himself. To this
extent, the jurisprudence has developed in the light of
the mandate given in our Constitution as well as
various Universal Declarations and directions issued
by the United Nations."
13. In Ajay Kumar Pal9 the delay in question was three years
and ten months which was found to be inordinate and that said
delay was not to the account of said petitioner but to the account
of the functionaries and authorities in question. Pertinently, the
matter was also considered from the standpoint of solitary
confinement and violations in that behalf.
14. Paras 44 and 48 of the decision of this Court in Shatrughan
Chauhan6 which were quoted in Ajay Kumar Pal9, had laid down
that undue long delay in execution of death sentence would entitle
the condemned prisoner to pray for commuting the death sentence
to that of life imprisonment. The individual cases were thereafter
dealt with in Shatrughan Chauhan6 and paragraph 105 onwards
of said decision show that in cases where there was a delay of 12
years (para 118), 9 ½ years (Para 137), 9 ½ years (Para 147), 7
years and 8 months (Para 161), 5 years and 8 months (Para 175)
and 7 years and 5 months (Para 209), the benefit of commutation
was extended by this Court.
15. If the instant matter is considered in light of these cases and
the settled principles, the alleged period in the instant matter is of
two years and three months i.e., starting from the receipt of the
mercy petition on 3.3.2011 by the Central Government till the
disposal on 15.5.2013. It must be stated that soon after the receipt
of the said mercy petition, the Ministry of Home Affairs,
Government of India forwarded the mercy petition to the Principal
Secretary, Home Department, Karnataka so that the Governor,
Karnataka could consider the mercy petition first.            In the
meantime, on 9.3.2011 in Writ Petition No.52 of 2011 preferred by
the appellant, this Court had granted stay of execution of death
The matter was considered by the State Cabinet on 7.5.2012
which decided to approve the note prepared by the Home
Department recommending rejection of the mercy petition. The
matter was then placed before the Hon’ble Governor who rejected
the mercy petition on 06.06.2012. The copy of the order passed
by the Hon’ble Governor and relevant documents were forwarded
by the State Government to the Central Government on
On 18.09.2012, certain information was sought by the
Central Government from the State Government which was
furnished to the Central Government on 26.12.2012. The matter
was thereafter taken up at the Central Government level.        The
Ministry of Home Affairs prepared an appropriate note for the
Hon’ble President who after considering the entirety of the matter
rejected the mercy petition on 12.05.2013.
16. Thus, the entire period beginning from 03.03.2011 to
15.05.2013 spanning over a period of 2 years and 3 months saw
disposal of mercy petition at two different levels, one, by the
Hon’ble Governor and other by the Hon’ble President.        All the
while, there was an order of stay granted by this Court on
19.3.2011 which was operating all through.
17. First and foremost, the time taken by each of these
authorities and the functionaries assisting them cannot be called
or termed as “inordinate delay” and secondly, it was not as if every
passing day was adding to the agony of appellant. The order of
stay of execution had put the matter in a different perspective. In
the given facts and circumstances of the case, in our view, the first
submission does not merit acceptance.     We are conscious of the
fact that in a recent decision in A.G. Perarivalan vs. State
through Superintendent of Police & Anr.11, a Bench of three
judges of this court commuted the sentence of death to life as the
petition preferred under Article 161 of the Constitution had
remained pending for two and half years with the Hon’ble
Governor, despite the recommendations of the State Cabinet for
remission of the sentence. In that case no decision was taken by
the Hon’ble Governor in spite of the recommendations of the State
Cabinet and as such the benefit of commutation was extended.
The facts which came up for consideration in said decision thus
stand on a completely different footing as against the instant
18. We now move to the second submission pertaining to solitary
confinement of the appellant. Reliance in this behalf has been
placed on the decision of this Court in Sunil Batra vs. Delhi
Administration & Ors.5; and also on the decision of Ajay Kumar
Pal9 in which segregation of the concerned petitioner, from the day
he was awarded death sentence till his mercy petition was
disposed of, was taken to be in violation of the law laid down by
this Court in Sunil Batra5 and the death sentence was commuted
to life on both counts, namely; inordinate delay in considering the
mercy petition and the solitary confinement that the concerned
petitioner was subjected to.
19. In the instant case, the letter written by Medical Officer,
Belgaum Central Prison on 6.11.2011 did say that the appellant
was kept in solitary confinement and said letter has been heavily
relied upon by the appellant in support of the second submission.
According to the letter, the appellant was kept in solitary
confinement since his admission to the prison in October, 2006
and that apart from common illness such as diarrhoea, fever,
running nose and backache, the appellant was found to be
suffering from psychosis with depression.          Pertinently, on
8.11.2011, a letter was sent by the Chief Superintendent, Belagavi
Central Prison to Additional DGP and IG Prisons, Karnataka to the
following effect: -
“….. With respect to the above subject, we submit, that the
death penalty convict no. 307, Umesh B.R. son of Ajjappa
Reddy’s appeal petition was rejected by the Hon’ble Supreme
Court, New Delhi and a letter confirming his death sentence
has been sent to this office as mentioned in the reference. The
said subject matter and processes have been explained in
detail several times to the convict in the presence of all
officers, but as the convict is mentally ill he is not agreeing to
submit any more mercy petitions. So we have not received
any mercy petitions from him. The convict was examined by
the Prison Doctors and have given a medical report which is
attached with this letter for your perusal and for further
This letter also affirms the fact that the appellant was
mentally ill.
20. The act on part of the medical officer in checking the health
and well-being of the appellant was obviously because of the
mandate of Section 29 of the Prisons Act, 1894 which is to the
following effect: -
“29.       Solitary confinement. – No cell shall be used for
solitary confinement unless it is furnished with the means of
enabling the prisoner to communicate at any time with an
officer of the prison, and every prisoner so confined in a cell
for more than twenty-four hours, whether as a punishment or
otherwise, shall be visited at least once a day by the Medical
Officer or Medical Subordinate.”
It must, therefore, be taken to be accepted that from 2006 till
2016, the appellant was kept in solitary confinement in “Andheri
Block” and it was only thereafter, some relaxation in the rigours of
the solitary confinement was effected and as the record shows,
from 2016 onwards the conditions were gradually relaxed.
21. The law on the point, as declared in Sunil Batra5 is very
clear and as was held by this Court in Ajay Kumar Pal9,
segregation of a convict from the day when he was awarded death
sentence till his mercy petition was disposed of, would be in
violation of law laid down by this Court in Sunil Batra5. In the
instant case, the death sentence was awarded to the appellant in
2006 by the trial Court and the mercy petition was finally disposed
of by the Hon’ble President on 12.5.2013, which means that the
incarceration of the appellant in solitary confinement and
segregation from 2006 to 2013 was without the sanction of law
and completely opposed to the principles laid down by this Court
22. In Ajay Kumar Pal9, on the issue of segregation of the
convict in violation of the principles laid down in Sunil Batra5,
this Court observed: -
“9. Furthermore, as submitted in the petition, the petitioner
has all the while been in solitary confinement i.e. since the
day he was awarded death sentence. While dealing with
Section 30(2) of the Prisons Act, 1894, which postulates
segregation of a person “under sentence of death” Krishna
Iyer, J. in Sunil Batra5 observed: (SCC p. 563, para 197-A)
“197-A. (5) The crucial holding under Section 30(2) is
that a person is not ‘under sentence of death’, even if
the sessions court has sentenced him to death subject
to confirmation by the High Court. He is not ‘under
sentence of death’ even if the High Court imposes, by
confirmation or fresh appellate infliction, death
penalty, so long as an appeal to the Supreme Court is
likely to be or has been moved or is pending. Even if
this Court has awarded capital sentence, Section 30
does not cover him so long as his petition for mercy to
the Governor and/or to the President permitted by the
Constitution, Code and Prison Rules, has not been
disposed. Of course, once rejected by the Governor
and the President, and on further application there is
no stay of execution by the authorities, he is ‘under
sentence of death’, even if he goes on making further
mercy petitions. During that interregnum he attracts
the custodial segregation specified in Section 30(2),
subject to the ameliorative meaning assigned to the
provision. To be ‘under sentence of death’ means ‘to
be under a finally executable death sentence’.”
(emphasis in original)
Speaking for the majority in the concurring judgment D.A.
Desai, J. stated thus : (Sunil Batra case5, SCC p. 572, para
“223. The expression ‘prisoner under sentence of
death’ in the context of sub-section (2) of Section 30
can only mean the prisoner whose sentence of death
has become final, conclusive and indefeasible which
cannot be annulled or voided by any judicial or
constitutional procedure. In other words, it must be a
sentence which the authority charged with the duty to
execute and carry out must proceed to carry out
without intervention from any outside authority.”
10. In the light of the enunciation of law by this Court, the
petitioner could never have been “segregated” till his mercy
petition was disposed of. It is only after such disposal that he
could be said to be under a finally executable death sentence.
The law laid down by this Court was not adhered to at all while
confining the petitioner in solitary confinement right since the
order of death sentence by the first court. In our view, this is
complete transgression of the right under Article 21 of the
Constitution causing incalculable harm to the petitioner.
11. The combined effect of the inordinate delay in disposal of
mercy petition and the solitary confinement for such a long
period, in our considered view has caused deprivation of the
most cherished right. A case is definitely made out under
Article 32 of the Constitution of India and this Court deems it
proper to reach out and grant solace to the petitioner for the
ends of justice. We, therefore, commute the sentence and
substitute the sentence of life imprisonment in place of death
sentence awarded to the petitioner. The writ petition thus
stands allowed.”
23. In its jurisdiction under Article 32 of the Constitution of
India, this Court had thus deemed it proper to reach out and grant
solace to the petitioner on both grounds, namely, delay in disposal
of mercy petition and solitary confinement for a long period. The
period of solitary confinement in Ajay Kumar Pal9 in violation of
the law laid down in Sunil Batra5 was from 2007 till 2014, i.e., for
nearly seven years.        In the instant case, the period of solitary
confinement is for about ten years and has two elements: one, from
2006 till the disposal of mercy petition in 2013; and secondly from
the date of such disposal till 2016.            The question then arises:
whether on this ground alone, the appellant is entitled to have the
death sentence commuted?
24. In     Shatrughan        Chauhan6,        solitary    confinement    was
accepted and recognised as one of the grounds on the basis of
which death sentence can be commuted. However, in the batch of
matters under consideration in Shatrughan Chauhan6, no
benefit was granted to any of the convicts on this ground.
Paragraph 88 onwards, the effect of the law laid down by this Court
in Sunil Batra5 and other cases was noticed and it was concluded
“90. It was, therefore, held in Sunil Batra case5, that the
solitary confinement, even if mollified and modified
marginally, is not sanctioned by Section 30 of the Prisons Act
for prisoners “under sentence of death”. The crucial holding
under Section 30(2) is that a person is not “under sentence of
death”, even if the Sessions Court has sentenced him to death
subject to confirmation by the High Court. He is not “under
sentence of death” even if the High Court imposes, by
confirmation or fresh appellate infliction, death penalty, so
long as an appeal to the Supreme Court is likely to be or has
been moved or is pending. Even if this Court has awarded
capital sentence, it was held that Section 30 does not cover
him so long as his petition for mercy to the Governor and/or
to the President permitted by the Constitution, has not been
disposed of. Of course, once rejected by the Governor and the
President, and on further application, there is no stay of
execution by the authorities, the person is under sentence of
death. During that interregnum, he attracts the custodial
segregation specified in Section 30(2), subject to the
ameliorative meaning assigned to the provision. To be “under
sentence of death” means “to be under a finally executable
death sentence”.
91. Even in Triveniben v. State of Gujarat7, this Court
observed that keeping a prisoner in solitary confinement is
contrary to the ruling in Sunil Batra5 and would amount to
inflicting “additional and separate” punishment not
authorised by law. It is completely unfortunate that despite
enduring pronouncement on judicial side, the actual
implementation of the provisions is far from reality. We take
this occasion to urge to the Jail Authorities to comprehend
and implement the actual intent of the verdict in Sunil
Batra v. Delhi Admn.5.”
25. The benefit of commutation was, however, granted in Ajay
Kumar Pal9 on the ground that the solitary confinement was
against the principles laid down in Sunil Batra5 and also on the
ground of delay. Having considered the entirety of matter, in our
view, the impact of solitary confinement were obviously evident in
the instant case, as would be clear from the letter given by the
medical professional on 6.11.2011 and the communication
emanating from the jail on 8.11.2011. The incarceration in solitary
confinement thus did show ill effects on the well-being of the
appellant. In the backdrop of these features of the matter, in our
view, the appellant is entitled to have the death sentence imposed
upon him to be commuted to death sentence to life.
26. At this stage, we may refer to a recent decision by a three-
Judge Bench in Mohd. Mannan alias Abdul Mannan vs. State
of Bihar12, where while accepting the review petition, the sentence
of death was commuted to imprisonment for life. However, it was
observed in paragraphs 87 and 88 as under: -
“87. Even though life imprisonment means imprisonment for
entire life, convicts are often granted reprieve and/or
remission of sentence after imprisonment of not less than 14
years. In this case, considering the heinous, revolting,
abhorrent and despicable nature of the crime committed by
the petitioner, we feel that the petitioner should undergo
imprisonment for life, till his natural death and no remission
of sentence be granted to him.
88. We, therefore, commute the death sentence imposed on
the petitioner to life imprisonment, till his natural death,
without reprieve or remission.”
27. Considering the entirety of facts and circumstances on
record, in our view, ends of justice would be met if while
commuting the death sentence awarded to the appellant, we
impose upon him sentence of life imprisonment with a rider that
he shall undergo minimum sentence of 30 years and if any
application for remission is moved on his behalf, the same shall be
considered on its own merits only after he has undergone actual
sentence of 30 years. If no remission is granted, it goes without
saying that as laid down by this Court in Gopal Vinayak Godse
vs. State of Maharashtra13, the sentence of imprisonment for life
shall mean till the remainder of his life.
28. The appeal is allowed accordingly.
29. Before we part, we must observe that the instruction quoted
in paragraph 3(f) of this Judgment leads to an incongruous
situation. According to it, the mercy petition must be filed within
seven days of the disposal of the appeal or dismissal of special
leave petition.    A convicted accused is entitled to file a review
petition within thirty days.    An anomalous situation, like the
present one, may arise where even before the review is filed, the
mercy petition is required to be filed. The concerned instruction
requires suitable modification so as to enable the convicted
accused to file mercy petition after exhaustion of remedies in Court
of law.
Date : 04-11-2022 This appeal was called on for pronouncement of
Judgment today.
UPON hearing the counsel the Court made the following
Hon’ble the Chief Justice of India pronounced the Reportable
Judgment       of  the  Bench  comprising  Hon’ble the  Chief   Justice of
India, Hon’ble Mr. Justice S. Ravindra Bhat and Hon’ble Mr. Justice
The operative portion of the judgment reads as under:
“1.     Leave granted.
27. Considering the entirety of facts and circumstances on
record, in our view, ends of justice would be met if while
commuting the death sentence awarded to the appellant, we
impose upon him sentence of life imprisonment with a rider
that he shall undergo minimum sentence of 30 years and if
any application for remission is moved on his behalf, the
same shall be considered on its own merits only after he has
undergone actual sentence of 30 years. If no remission is
granted, it goes without saying that as laid down by this
Court in Gopal Vinayak Godse vs. State of Maharashtra1,
the sentence of imprisonment for life shall mean till the
remainder of his life.
28. The appeal is allowed accordingly.
29. Before we part, we must observe that the instruction
quoted in paragraph 3(f) of this Judgment leads to an
incongruous situation. According to it, the mercy petition
must be filed within seven days of the disposal of the appeal
or dismissal of special leave petition. A convicted accused is
entitled to file a review petition within thirty days. An
anomalous situation, like the present one, may arise where
even before the review is filed, the mercy petition is required
to be filed. The concerned instruction requires suitable
modification so as to enable the convicted accused to file
mercy petition after exhaustion of remedies in Court of law.”
Pending applications, if any, also stand disposed of.
