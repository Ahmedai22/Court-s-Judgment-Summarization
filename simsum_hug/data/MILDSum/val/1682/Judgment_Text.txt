1.             As per our previous order dated 25th February 2022, we had directed
MSRDC (Respondent No.8) to deposit a sum of Rs. 10 crores (i.e. Rs. 1 Lakh per
affected family comprising the Petitioner Society) to be available for distribution as
ad-hoc interim compensation. On that day, Shri Radhesyam Mopalwar, Managing
Director, MSRDC who was present before us, undertook to deposit this sum of Rs.
10 crores with the Registrar, Judicial I, of this Court. MSRDC has accordingly
deposited this sum with this Court. The matter was placed today to hear the parties
on disbursement of this amount to the affected fisherfolk families comprising the
2.             Shri. Zaman Ali, learned Advocate for the Petitioner, submitted that
despite over 7 months having passed since our detailed order dated 12 th August 2021
directing compensation to be paid to the Petitioner for the loss of their fishing
livelihood, no compensation whatsoever has been paid. In light of this, the learned
counsel for the Petitioner submits that the entire amount of Rs. 10 crores deposited
in Court should be paid out to the Petitioner Society, as per the suggestion made by
the Learned Amicus at the previous hearing. The Petitioner Society, he submits, will
distribute this money to its individual members and keep detailed accounts of all such
disbursements, which shall be placed before this Court.
3.             Shri. Milind Sathe, learned Senior Advocate for MSRDC (Respondent
No. 8) opposed any disbursement being made to the Petitioner or its members at this
stage on the ground that the impact of the TCB-III project on the livelihood of
fisherfolk has not yet been ascertained. Shri Sathe submitted that there has not been
any determination of whether TCB-III project will have any impact at all on the
livelihood of fisherfolk. He said that this exercise will have to be carried out by a
specialized agency and that until the impact of the TCB-III project on the Petitioner
Society (and its members being the Koli fisherfolk community) is assessed, there can
be no distribution of compensation be it ad hoc or final. Therefore, he submits that
no disbursement should be made till the Central Marine Fisheries Research Institute
(CMFRI), who has been engaged to study the detailed impact of TCB-III on the
livelihood of fisherfolk, submits its report. MSRDC’s apprehension is that that
should the final compensation amount be less than interim compensation of Rs. 1
lakh per family, then MSRDC will be put to hardship in recovering any excess
amounts from the Petitioner’s 900-odd members.
4.             According to Shri. Sharan Jagtiani, Learned Senior Advocate and
Amicus Curiae, MSRDC’s submission that that there has been no determination of
whether TCB-III project will have any impact at all on the livelihood of the Petitioner
fisherfolk is incorrect. Shri. Jagtiani relies on our Order and Judgment dated 12 th
August, 2021, more particularly paragraphs 1, 3, 46 to 49 and 51 to 58, to submit that
there is in fact a finding, at least prima facie, of the TCB-III project’s adverse impact
on the livelihood of fisherfolk who are defined in the above Order and Judgment as
Project Affected Persons because of the ongoing construction of TCB-III. At the time
when the matter was being argued this position was not contested by the
Respondents on this aspect as such.
5.            Further, Shri Jagtiani submitted that MSRDC’s concern about
recovery of excess compensation is based on a highly unlikely scenario that the final
compensation will be less than the interim compensation. He points to the Draft
Compensation Policy dated 29 November 2021 which adopts the approach of the
National Green Tribunal in its order dated 27 February 2015 (in the matter of
Ramdas Janardan Kohli) in respect of quantifying compensation. The NGT found
that there was a loss of the customary right to fishing and awarded ad-hoc
compensation in the following manner. The NGT presumed: (i) loss of livelihood
would be for a period of three years; (ii) a family consists of 4 members who would be
earning Rs. 200 per person per day (i.e Rs. 800 per family per day) which annually
amounts to Rs. 2,92,000/- per family; (iii) due to mere subsistence 1/3 of this
amount was reduced and the final figure of compensation was Rs. 1,94,666/- per
family per year. The total compensation per family for a period of 3 years awarded
was Rs. 5,83,998/-. Given that this Court has already found that TCB-III is likely to
affect the customary rights of fisherfolk vide order dated 12 th August 2021 and that
the state’s draft compensation policy has recommended the NGT approach for
quantifying compensation, the final compensation amount will almost certainly
exceed Rs. 1 lakh per family. If the final policy is based on other formula’s such as that
of the Mumbai Trans Harbour Link then the compensation would be even more.
Therefore, Shri Jagtiani submits that MSRDC’s concern of recovering any excess
compensation amount paid to the Petitioner’s members is not a realistic concern.
6.             Having heard the parties, we are unable to accept the contention of
Shri. Sathe, learned Senior Advocate appearing for MSRDC, that there has not been
any determination of whether TCB-III project will have any impact at all on the
livelihood of fisherfolk. As rightly pointed out by Shri. Jagtiani, Amicus Curiae, we
have in our order dated 12th August 2021 held that the TCB-III project is likely to
have an adverse impact on the customary right of the Petitioner’s members to fish for
a living. In fact, the entire subject matter of Issue No. (ii) in our order dated 12 th
August 2021 was a consideration of this question: whether TCB III is likely to
detrimentally impact customary right of the Petitioner’s members to fish for a living.
We have also determined, in answering Issue No. (i) that the Petitioner has
established that they have a customary right to carry on the activity of fishing in the
Thane Creek. The issues that fell for determination before us in our Order of 12 th
August 2021 were as follows:
(i)      Whether the Petitioner can prove that the Project Affected
Fishermen (as defined in paragraph 1) have a customary right to fish for a
(ii)     Whether TCB III is likely to detrimentally impact the practice of
(iii)    Whether a state-wide policy for all categories of persons whose
customary rights are affected by infrastructure projects is required? If yes, what is
the framework for such a policy that can be recommended to the appropriate
(iv)     If the answer to Issue (i), Issue (ii) and Issue (iii) is yes, what should be
the contours of a policy compensating those affected by TCB III? ”
7.           In paragraph no. 1, we defined Project Affected Fishermen as the
members of the Petitioner Society:
“1.      The Petitioner is a society registered under the Maharashtra
Cooperative Societies Act, 1960. The Petitioner states that it comprises of
members from the traditional fishermen community known as Koli
community, from Koliwadas such as Vashigaon, Juhugaon,
Koparkhairane, Ghansoli, and Diva (“Project Affected Fishermen”). The
Petitioner states that it was formed in 2001, and is actively engaged in raising
welfare concerns on behalf of fishermen from Koliwadas located in and around
8.           In paragraph 3, we described the TCB-III project as:
“TCB III is a proposed six-lane bridge on the Sion-Panvel Highway. It is being
constructed as an addition to the existing Thane Creek Bridge, near Vashi,
Maharashtra. The Thane Creek Bridge is built across Thane Creek,
connecting the city of Mumbai to the main land at Navi Mumbai. It is one of
the four entry points into Mumbai, the other three being the Airoli Bridge,
Mulund Check Naka and Dahisar Check Naka. According to Respondent
No.8, Thane Creek Bridge I (“TCB I”) was constructed in 1973 and Thane
Creek Bridge II (“TCB II”) was built and opened to traffic in 1997…”
9.             After analyzing the various documents placed on record by the
Petitioner, in respect to issue (i), we concluded in paragraph 49 that:
49.      The documents, therefore, establish with sufficient clarity that
the Project Affected Fishermen have a customary right to fish for a
living in Thane creek. Most importantly, the Affidavits in Reply of
Respondent No. 1 also appears to accept this position.
10.            Having found that the Petitioner’s members (Project Affected
Fishermen) have established their customary right to fish for a living in the Thane
creek, we proceeded to consider the question of whether TCB III is likely to
detrimentally impact the practice of such customary rights in issue (ii).
11.            It is pertinent to note that regarding this issue no (ii), none of the
Respondents even contended before us that the TCB-III would not have any impact
at all on the ecology and the customary rights of fisherfolk. The Respondents
“SUBMISSIONS ON ISSUE (ii) – Whether TCB III is likely to detrimentally
affect the practice of customary rights?
19.      Respondent No. 8 has in its Affidavit not denied the possible
impact that TCB III will have during the construction phase and
thereafter, on the mangroves, biodiversity, fish catch etc.
20.      However, Respondent No. 8 submitted that the navigational
channels for fishing activities will not be impacted, as TCB III is only in
the nature of expansion of TCB II. It is planned parallel to the existing
TCB I and TCB II and is sandwiched between TCB II and the railway
bridge next to it. For this reason, Respondent No.8 submits that the
addition of TCB III will have no material effect on the navigational
channels.
21.      Shri Patel for Respondent Nos. 1 and 2 submitted that TCB III
is likely to impact the fisheries and livelihood of the Project Affected
Fishermen, because, during the construction period, movement in the
inter-tidal fishing areas will be curtailed and mangroves, mudflats,
and creeklets in Thane Creek will to some extent be destroyed.”
12.          Our findings were as follows:
51.      We have analyzed the submissions of the various parties. On an
appreciation of the material before us, we are of the view that TCB III
is likely to impact the Project Affected Fishermen’s customary right to
fish for a living, and therefore answer Issue (ii) in the affirmative.
52.      The Court only needs to satisfy itself that there will be some
or a likely impact. If it is so satisfied, which it is, then that is enough
for us to hold that the customary rights to fish for a livelihood are
being impacted. The extent of the impact may be considered in greater
depth by the committee to be constituted, as discussed later in this
judgment.
53.      The livelihood of fishermen is dependent on a healthy
environment and balanced ecology. The Department of Environment,
Forests and Wildlife of the Government of India has recognized this in the
Preamble of the CRZ Notification, 2011 by stating that coastal stretches
need to be protected “… with a view to ensure livelihood security to the
fisher communities…” It requires that any development activity needs to
be done in a “… sustainable manner based on scientific principles taking
into account the dangers of natural hazards in the coastal areas…”
54.      The MCZMA itself, in its 114th Minutes of Meeting dated 2
and 3 November 2016 has stated that TCB III should be constructed
in a manner which does not affect the navigational routes of local
fishermen. This shows that the MCZMA believes, and is aware, that
navigational routes of the Project Affected Fishermen are likely to be
impacted.
55.      Further, Respondent Nos. 1 and 2 in a communication to
various authorities of the State Government recognizes that projects
implemented in the maritime area or along the sea coast would impact
the livelihood of local fishermen in the proximity of the project.
56.      Both of these documents show that even the State
Government authorities are of the view that maritime projects like the
TCB III are likely to impact the livelihood of fishermen communities
in the vicinity of the project.
57.      Further, we agree with the Amicus Curiae’s submission that
destruction of mangroves for TCB III will disturb the ecological
balance in Thane Creek. The vital role that mangroves play in
maintaining ecological balance and sustaining biodiversity is well
documented. The Thane Creek Flamengo Sanctuary Management
Plan and The Preliminary Report on Biodiversity of Thane Creek,
which are discussed above also bear out that the destruction of
mangroves often results, inter alia, in loss of biodiversity, and reduced
fish catch, which in turn would impact livelihood of the Project
Affected Fishermen. The judgment in Bombay Environmental Action
Group v. State of Maharashtra (supra) of this Court, elucidates the
importance of mangroves on the ecology. The judgment states, at
“In the instant case it has been established that
58.            Being satisfied that there is likely to be some impact, we
prefer to leave the exercise of determining the extent of the impact
with more precision to a body that has the wherewithal to make such a
determination.
customary rights are being impacted, we also hold that they are
entitled to be compensated for their loss, subject to what is stated
below.
60.           As of today, no state-wide compensation policy exists which
provides guidance on how to constitute a committee to look into fine print
of a compensation policy. Which brings us to the next issue.”
13.           Our Order and Judgment of 12 th August 2021, therefore, holds that the
TCB-III is likely to affect the Petitioner’s members (defined as the Project Affected
Persons) and that they are entitled to be compensated for such loss. What was left
open for the compensation committee to determine was the precise extent of such
loss and quantum of compensation.
14.           We will now consider the question of disbursement of ad hoc
compensation especially keeping in mind that the Order and Judgment dated 12 th
August 2021 was more than seven months ago and one of the objects of the said
Order was to ensure that persons who are affected receive the benefit of
compensation.
14.1          As stated above, in our order of 12 August 2021 we held that TCB-III is
likely to adversely affect the customary rights of Petitioner’s members and therefore
they are entitled to be compensated. These issues were never contested before us
until this belated stage, more than seven months since our order.
14.2           When the matter came up on 1st December 2021, we were informed
that CMFRI has been engaged to study the detailed impact of TCB-III on the
livelihood of the curtained fisherfolk. We accordingly directed CMFRI to be
represented before us to apprise us of the steps taken by them in this regard.
14.3           On 16th February 2022 we were informed that CMFRI’s entire exercise
would take at least one year to be completed. Despite six months having passed since
our order of 12 August 2021, we were informed that it will take at least a year to
finally decided the issue of compensation. As the fisherfolk and their families cannot
be expected to starve till the authorities decide the quantum of compensation, we
directed CMFRI to submit an interim report on the quantum of interim
compensation required to be paid to these fisherfolk. On that day, the advocates for
MSRDC on instructions made a statement that upon CMFRI recommending the
quantum of interim compensation, MSRDC would disburse the same to eligible
fishermen, which statement was accepted. The responsible officer from CMFRI was
directed to appear before this Court on the next occasion.
14.4           In the Affidavit dated 22nd February 2022 filed before us, CMFRI inter
alia stated that it is not competent to render assistance for determining
compensation. CMFRI can only assist any agency or institute such as the Tata
Institute of Social, which may be entrusted with the responsibility for determining
compensation with technical data.
15.           Thus, seven months later there is still no clarity as to how the final
compensation will be quantified or by whom. We cannot expect these fisherfolk to
wait one more year without any livelihood or compensation. We find merit in the
submissions of Shri Zaman Ali and Shri Jagtiani that in all likelihood the final
compensation will exceed the present interim compensation of Rs. 1 lakh per family.
If, for example, the compensation rate or formula as per the NGT Order is taken into
consideration, the NGT took, on an ad-hoc basis, the loss to be for a period of three
years at Rs. 1,94,666/- per family per year. The total compensation per family
awarded was nearly 6 lakhs. Given that the Compensation Committee in its Draft
Policy (which itself will have to be considered by the State Government cabinet in
terms of our Order dated 16th February 2022) has recommended the NGT approach
and that the project itself will take more than 3 years to complete, it is very likely that
the final compensation amount will exceed Rs. 1 lakh per family. We are also of the
view that if the ad hoc compensation is paid to the Petitioner Society and not to
individual fisherfolk there is more accountability. In the event of the final
compensation being less than this ad hoc amount or if in the final report for payment
of compensation concludes that compensation is not payable to some members of the
Petitioner, then it would be the Petitioner Society’s responsibility through it officer
bearers to ensure that the excess amounts of ad hoc compensation are returned to
16.            In light of this we find it reasonable to order that interim compensation
of Rs. 1 lakh per family should be paid to the Petitioner’s members.
17.            We accordingly direct the Registrar, Judicial I, of this Court to pay the
sum of Rs. 10 crores deposited by MSRDC to the Petitioner within two weeks from
today, who shall distribute it to its members in the sum of Rs. 1 Lakh per family. The
Petitioner shall place on record all details of such monies distributed. We also note
the undertaking of the Petitioner Society through its office bearers to ensure that the
amount of ad hoc compensation that may be determined to be in excess of what is to
be paid by MSRDC will be brought back in to Court if so determined by Court in this
18.            Since this is only a distribution towards ad hoc compensation, we are
also of the view that MSRDC must either with the assistance of CMFRI or any other
agency proceed to determine the final compensation payable to the Project Affected
Persons within three months from today. The ad hoc compensation is not a substitute
for the final compensation.
19.          All concerned to act on a digitally authenticated copy of this order.
