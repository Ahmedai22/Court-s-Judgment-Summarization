registered as Special ACB case No. 4 of 2019 before the
2.2 That, before framing of the charge, the applicant
submitted an application Ex. 9 for discharge him under the
provisions of Section 227 of the Code of Criminal Procedure
since there was no evidence to frame charge against the
applicant. The learned Special Judge was pleased to hear the
application Ex. 9 and after hearing, was pleased to dismiss
such application for discharge by order dated 22.11.2021 and
therefore, applicant has approached this court by way of
present application against the order of rejection of discharge
3.    Heard learned advocates for the applicant.
4.    It was submitted by learned advocate for the applicant
that it clearly shows from the record that there is no prima
facie case to frame charge though learned Special Judge has
not considered all the grounds mentioned in the application for
discharge in its true perspective and has not dealt with the
same. That, the judgments cited by the applicant are clearly
applicable to the facts of the present case, though the learned
Special Judge erred in holding that such judgments are not
applicable. That, there was no telephonic conversation of the
applicant with the complainant on the date of raid and even
the call details record is also given but there is no such
evidence. That, the audio recording of the trap has been done
and transcript has been given to the applicant along with the
charge sheet including audio CD but the transcript which is
given along with the cahrge sheet is incomplete and there are
several mistakes in the script and for some recording, even
transcript is not given, therefore, the petitioner on his own
after taking services of an expert has prepared the true and
correct transcript of the audio CD. That the learned Special
judge has not considered audio conversations of approximately
last 3 minutes, recorded in the voice recorder given in the form
of audio CD at page no. 138 and 140 of the charge sheet
which is deliberately and intentionally not scripted by the
Investigating Officer to hide the facts and factual events, but
conversations are part of charge sheet. So far as sanction is
concerned, the sanction is granted by Under-Secretary,
Industries and Mines Department, Government of Gujarat
dated 28.05.2019,who is not competent to grant the sanction.
So far as the findings given by the learned Special Judge about
the sanction recorded is concerned, the learned Special Judge
ought to have considered and ought to have seen as to whether
the sanction is valid or not. It is settled law that without
sanction, there cannot be any prosecution and if the sanction is
granted, then the validity of the said sanction whether it is
legal or illegal can also be considered by the learned Special
Judge in discharge application but the learned Special Judge
erred in holding that it is a matter of trial and recording of
evidence and cannot be considered at this stage. That, the
applicant has not gone into the validity of application or non-
application of mind while granting the sanction, but has taken
the legal ground that the officer, who has accorded the
sanction, was not competent to grant sanction, and therefore
also, the learned Special Judge ought to have considered the
same. That, when cognizance was taken, the applicant was in
service but under suspension and the applicant retired on
30.06.2020 and the sanction was accorded on 28.05.2019. As
per the case of the applicant, the sanctioning authority is not
competent to remove the applicant from service, and therefore,
the said sanction is not valid and legal and is not as per Section
19 of the Prevention of Corruption Act. That the order of
suspension was also challenged by the applicant before this
court and this court was pleased to issue notice in the matter
and at present the said matter is pending. In support of his
arguments learned advocate for the applicant has placed his
reliance in case of State of Mizoram v. C. Sangnghina reported
in (2019) 13 SCC 335. Ultimately, it was submitted by learned
advocate for the application to allow present application.
5.     Having heard learned advocate for the applicant and
considering the averments made in the application and
conclusion arrived at by the learned trial Court, first of all we
have to consider the the grounds of discharge, which have
been laid down by the Apex Court in 2001 AAR 394 (SC),
Omwati Vs. State (Delhi Administration), holding that the
court may discharge accused on following consideration:-
(i) If upon consideration that there is no sufficient
ground for proceeding against the accused, he shall
discharge the accused for which he is required to record
his reasons for so doing. No reasons are required to be
recorded when the charges are framed against the
accused persons.
(ii) Where it is shown that the evidence which the
prosecution proposes to adduce to prove the guilt of the
accused, even if fully accepted before it is challenged in
cross-examination or rebutted by defence evidence
cannot show that the accused committed the crime, then
and then alone the Court can discharge the accused. The
Court is not required to enter into meticulous
consideration of evidence and material placed before it at
this stage.
6.    It appears from the record that while concluding the
discharge application filed by the applicant, learned trial court
has observed that prima facie, the prosecution does not have
any reason to make false allegations against the accused and in
connection with the application under Section 227 of the Code
of Criminal Procedure, while considering the evidence
produced before the court by the prosecution, it is to be seen
that whether his prima facie involvement is there or not. It is
further observed that while reading the complaint, the fact has
been disclosed that in this case, the applicant/accused no.1 has
sought amount of Rs. 1,50,000/- and prima facie appears that
there was meeting of mind between both the accused persons
and as per say of the accused no.1, the accused no.2 accepted
the amount from the complainant in presence of the panch
no.1 and recovery of bribe amount has been made from the
accused no.2. It is further observed by learned court below that
at this stage, the court should not have to make evaluation of
the evidence and at this stage, it is not to be seen whether the
accused will be held innocence or not but from the produced
record it appears that the strong suspicious case is found then
the court can discharge the accused. But, as per observation of
the court below, prima facie case is found against the accused
no.1/applicant. Thus, while considering the observations made
by the learned lower court, this court deems it not fit to accept
the prayer made by the applicant in the present application.
7.    This Court in the case of State of Bihar Vs. Ramesh Singh,
reported in AIR 1977 SC 2018 observed as under:-
“4. Under section 226 of the Code while opening the case
for the prosecution the Prosecutor has got to describe the
charge against the accused and state by what evidence he
proposes to prove the guilt of the accused. Thereafter comes
at the initial stage the duty of the Court to consider the record
of the case and the documents submitted therewith and to
hear the submissions of the accused and the prosecution in
that behalf. 'The Judge has to pass thereafter an order either
under section 227 or section 228 of the Code. If "the Judge
consider that there is not. sufficient ground for proceeding
against the accused, he shall discharge the accused and
record his reasons for so doing", as enjoined by section 227.
If, on the other hand, "the Judge is of opinion that there, is
ground for presuming. that the accused has committed an
(b)in exclusively triable by the Court, he shall frame in
writing a charge against the accused'-', as provided in section
228. Reading the two provisions together in juxta position, as
they have got to be, it would be clear that at the beginning
and the initial stage of the trial the truth, veracity and effect
of the evidence which the Prosecutor proposes to adduce are
not to be meticulously judged. Nor is any weight to be
attached to the probable defence of the accused. It is not
obligatory for the Judge at that stage of the trial to consider in
any detail and weigh in a sensitive balance whether the facts,
if proved, would be incompatible with the innocence of the
accused or not. The standard of test and judgment which is to
be finally applied before recording a finding regarding the
guilt or otherwise of the accused is not exactly to be applied at
the stage of deciding the matter under section 227 or section
228 of the Code. At that stage the Court is not to 'see whether
there is sufficient ground for conviction of the accused or
whether the trial is sure to end in his conviction. Strong
suspicion against the accused, if the matter remains in the
region of suspicion, cannot take the place of proof of his guilt
at the conclusion of the trial. But at the initial stage if there is
a strong suspicion which leads the Court to think that there is
ground for presuming that the accused has committed an
offence then it is not open to the Court to say that there is no
sufficient ground for proceeding against the accused. The
presumption of the guilt of the accused which is to be drawn
at the, initial stage is not in the sense of the law governing the
trial of criminal cases in France where the accused is
presumed to be guilty unless the contrary is proved. But it is
only for the purpose of deciding prima facie whether the
Court should proceed with the trial or not. if the evidence
which the Prosecutor proposes to adduce to prove the guilt of
the accused even if fully accepted before it is challenged in
cross-examination or rebutted by the defence evidence, if any,
cannot show that the accused committed the offence, then
there will be no sufficient ground for proceeding with the
trial. An exhaustive list of the circumstances to indicate as to
what will lead to one conclusion or the other is neither
possible nor advisable. We may just illustrate the difference of
the law by one more example. If the scales of pan as to the
guilt or innocence of the accused are something like even at
the conclusion of the, trial, then, on the theory of benefit of
doubt the case is to end in his acquittal. But, if, on the other
hand, it is so at the initial stage of making an order under
section 227 or section 228, then in such a situation ordinarily
and generally the order which will have to be made will be
one under section 228 and not under section 227.
8.   This Court in the case of State of Maharashtra Vs. Som
Nath Thapa, reported in AIR 1977 SC 2018 observed as
“24. The aforesaid decisions, weighty as they are, lead us to
conclude that to establish a charge of conspiracy knowledge
about indulgence in either an illegal act or a legal act by
illegal means is necessary. In some cases, intent of unlawful
use being made of the goods or services in question may be
inferred from the knowledge itself. This apart, the
prosecution has not to establish that a particular unlawful
use was intended, so long as the goods or service in question
could not be put to any lawful use. Finally, when the ultimate
offence consists of a chain of actions, it would not be
necessary for the prosecution to establish, to bring home the
charge of conspiracy, that each of the conspirators had the
knowledge of what the collaborator would do, so long as it is
known that the collaborator would put the goods or service
to an unlawful use. When can charge be framed ?
30. In Antulay's case, Bhagwati, CJ., opined, after noting the
difference in the language of the three pairs of section, that
despite the difference there is no scope for doubt that at the
stage at which the Court is required to consider the question
of framing of charge, the test of "prima facie" case has to be
applied. According to Shri Jethmalani, a prima facie case even
be said to have been made out when the evidence, unless
rebutted, would make the accused liable to conviction. In our
view, better and clearer statement of law would be that if
there is ground for presuming that the accused has committed
the offence, a court can justifiably say that a prima facie case
against him exists, and so, frame charge against him for
committing that offence".
31. Let us note the meaning of the word "presume". In Black's
Law Dictionary it has been defined to mean "to believe or
accept upon probable evidence". (Emphasis ours). In Shorter
Oxford English Dictionary it has been mentioned that in law
"presume" means "to take as proved until evidence to the
contrary is forthcoming" , Stroud's Legal Dictionary has
quoted in this context a certain judgement according to
which "A presumption is a probable consequence drawn from
facts (either certain or proved by direct testimony) as to the
truth of a fact alleged." (Emphasis supplied). In Law Lexicon
by P. Ramanath Aiyer the same quotation finds place at page
1007 of 1987 edition.
32. The aforesaid shows that if on the basis of materials on
record, a court could come to the conclusion that commission
of the offence is a probable consequence, a case for framing
of charge exists. To put it differently, if the Court were to
think that the accused might have committed the offence it
can frame the charge, though for conviction the conclusion is
required to be that the accused has committed the offence. It
is apparent that at the stage of framing of charge, probative
value of the materials on record cannot be gone into; the
materials brought on record by the prosecution has to be
accepted as true at that stage.
33. In the written submissions filed on behalf of appellant
Moolchand, it has been urged that TADA having lapsed,
section 1(4) which saves, inter alia, any investigation
instituted before the Act had expired, itself lapsed because of
which it is not open to the prosecution to place reliance on
this sub-section to continue the proceeding after expiry of
57. A perusal of the statement made by aforesaid two
Inspectors shows that they had made two statements at two
points of time. The first of these has been described as "original
statement' by Shri Shirodkar in his written note and the second
as "further statement". In the original statement, these two
Inspectors are said to have told Thapa, on being asked which
would be crucial places for laying trap, that the same were
Purar Phata and Behan Phata, at which places trap was in fact
laid. But then, in the further statement the Inspectors are said
to have opined that watch should be kept at Sai-Morba-
Goregoan junction, because that was the main exit point for
smuggling done at Shrivardhan and Shekhadi. Shri Shirodkar
would not like us to rely on what was stated subsequently by
these Inspectors, as that was under pressure of investigation
undertaken subsequently by the C.B.I. We do not think that the
law permits us to find out at this stage as to which of the two
versions given by two Inspectors is correct. We have said so
because at the stage of framing of charge probative value of
the statement cannot be gone into, which would come to be
decided at the close of the trial. There is no doubt that if the
subsequent statement be correct, Nakabandi was done not at
the proper place, as that left Sai-Morba Road free for the
smugglers to carry the goods upto Bombay.”
9.   This Court in the case of State of Maharashtra Vs. Priya
Sharan Maharan, reported in AIR 1997 SC 2041 observed as
“8. The law on the subject is now well-settled, as pointed
out in Niranjan Singh Punjabi vs. Jitendra Bijjaya (1990) 4
SCC 76, that at Sections 227 and 228 stage the Court is
required to evaluate the material and documents on record
with a view of finding out if the facts emerging therefrom
taken at their face value disclose the existence of all the
ingredients constituting the alleged offence. The Court may,
for this limited purpose, sift the evidence as it cannot be
expected even at that initial stage to accept all that the
prosecution states as gospel truth even if it is opposed to
common sense or the broad probabilities of the case.
Therefore, at the stage of framing of the charge the Court has
to consider the material with a view to find out if there is
ground for presuming that the accused has committed the
offence or that there is not sufficient ground for proceeding
against him and not for the purpose of arriving at the
conclusion that it is not likely to lead to a conviction.
11. The above quoted paragraphs from the judgment
clearly disclose that the High Curt was much influenced by
the submission made on behalf of the defence that Kripalu
Maharaj is a saintly old man, who has renounced the world,
who is engrossed in spiritual activity and who has thousands/
millions of disciples all over India and, therefore, he was not
likely to indulge in the illegal acts alleged against him. It
failed to appreciate that it is not unusual to come across cases
where the so-called spiritual heads exploit you girls and
women who become their disciples and come under their
spell. Moreover, the reasoning of the High Court that it also
does not stand to reason that a saintly man who has
thousand/millions of disciples all over India would commit
sexual intercourse with the praharak of his cult in presence of
his disciples stands vitiated because of the vice of misreading
the statements. The three girls have nowhere stated in their
statements that R-2 had sexual intercourse with them in
presence of other disciples. The High Court gave too much
importance to the conduct of the three victims and the delay
in disclosing those illegal acts to their parent and the police.
What the High Court has failed to appreciate is how a victim
of such an offence will behave would depend upon the
circumstances in which she is placed. It often happens that
such victims do not complain against such illegal acts
immediately because of factors like fear or shame or
uncertainties about the reactions of their parents or husbands
in case of married girls or women and the adverse
consequences which, they apprehend, would follow because
of disclosure of such acts. What the three girls had stated in
their statements was not inherently improbable or unnatural.
They have disclosed the reasons why they could not
immediately complain about those illegal acts for such a long
time. What the High Court has failed to appreciate is that
while making complaint to the police or giving their
statements they were not required to give detailed
explanations. As stated earlier, what the Court has failed to
appreciate is that while making a complaint to the police or
giving their statements they were not required to give detailed
explanations. As stated earlier, what the Court has to consider
at the stage of framing of the charge is whether the version of
the person complaining together with his/her explanation is
prima facie believable or not. It was, therefore, not proper for
the High Court to seek independent corroboration at that
stage and to quash the charge and discharge the accused in
absence thereof. It was also improper to describe the version
of Sulakshana as false because no extensive injuries were
noticed on her person while she was examined by a doctor on
the basis of some observations made in Modi's textbook on
"Medical Jurisprudence and Toxicology". We do not think it
proper to say anything further as, in the view that we are
taking, the accused will have to face a trial and whatever
observations we make now may cause some prejudice to them
at the trial. We would only say that the High Court was
wholly wrong in discarding the material placed before the
Court as false and discharging the accused on the ground.”
10.         Thus, in view of the above decisions and discussions
made hereinabove, the impugned order does not suffer from
any illegality, irregularity or impropriety and present revision
application is liable to be dismissed and accordingly, stands
dismissed at the admission stage without issuing any notice to
the otherside.
