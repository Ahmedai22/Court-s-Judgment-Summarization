         REPRESENTED BY THE SECRETARY TO THE GOVERNMENT OF INDIA,
         MINISTRY OF HOME AFFAIRS, NEW DELHI-110001
          REPRESENTED BY THE CHIEF ELECTION COMMISSION OF INDIA
          REPRESENTED BY THE COMMISSIONER AND SECRETARY TO THE
          REPRESENTED BY THE STATE COORDINATOR ACHYUT PLAZA
Advocate for the Respondent : ASSTT.S.G.I.
      Heard Mr. A. Paul, learned counsel for the petitioner. Also heard Ms. L. Devi, learned
counsel appearing on behalf of Mr. R.K. Dev Choudhury, learned Asstt. SGI for respondent
no.1 & 4 and ; Ms. A. Verma, learned Special Standing Counsel, F.T. appearing for respondent

Ms. U. Das, learned Government Advocate, Assam, appearing for respondent nos.3 & 5.
2.      Considering the nature of the case, we are of the opinion that the present petition can
be disposed of at the motion stage itself without issuing any formal notice to the
respondents.
3.      The present petition has been filed by the petitioner, namely, Md. Maynul @ Moinul
Hoque @ Md. Moinul, son of late Faizuddin, resident of village Jorgarh under P.S.:Tezpur,
Dist.:Sonitpur, Assam on being aggrieved by the impugned ex parate order dated 31.12.2020
passed by the Foreigners Tribunal, Tezpur No.1, Assam, in F.T.(D) Case No.3512/2012,
declaring the petitioner to be a foreigner of post 1971 stream.
4.      Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that earlier in another proceeding i.e. in F.T.
(D) Case No.8312/2012, the Foreigners Tribunal Tezpur 1 st, Sonitpur by order dated
31.08.2017 had held that the petitioner, namely, Md. Moinul @ Moinul Hoque, son of Late
Foizuddin (Abdul Hussain), resident of village Jorgarh under P.S.Tezpur, Dist. Sonitpur, Assam
had been able to discharge his onus to prove that he is not a foreigner but an Indian.
Accordingly, the reference was answered in negative against the State and in favour of the
petitioner/proceedee. However, the Foreigners Tribunal Tezpur No.1, Assam in the subsequent
proceeding i.e. in F.T.(D) Case No.3512/2012 took a view that the proceedee neither
submitted his representation nor adduced his evidence in support of his claim that he is an
Indian Citizen and accordingly, failed to prove that he is an Indian citizen.
5.       The Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that though the petitioner had
appeared before the Tribunal after receiving the notice, the reason for the petitioner’s inability
to appear before the Foreigners Tribunal, Tezpur No.1 on several occasions was because of
ongoing COVID pandemic and as such, it has been submitted that the said ex parte order
dated 31.12.2020 may be set aside by remanding the matter to the Foreigners Tribunal,
more particularly, in the light of the earlier opinion referred by the same Tribunal on
31.08.2017 in F.T.(D) Case No.8312/2012.
6.     According to the learned counsel for the petitioner since there is a similarity in the
names and particulars of the proceedee in both the proceedings, the second proceeding in
respect of F.T.(D) Case No.3512/2012 before the Foreigners Tribunal, Tezpur (1 st), Assam
could not be sustainable in terms of the decision of the Hon’ble Supreme Court passed in
Abdul Kuddus vs Union of India (2019) 6 SCC 604, as the proceeding before the
Foreigners Tribunal, Tezpur (1st), Assam in respect of F.T.(D) Case No.3512/2012 is quasi
judicial and the principle of res judicata will be applicable in this proceeding.
7. It has been clearly mentioned in Abdul Kuddus (supra) that if there had been an order by
the Foreigners Tribunal in favour of a person determining the citizenship, the said decision will
be binding on subsequent proceedings against the same person and there cannot be another
proceeding to re-determine the citizenship of the person, by applying the principle of res
8.       In the present case, since this aspect could not be considered by the Foreigners
Tribunal as it was decided ex parte, we are also of the view that the matter requires to be
decided afresh by the Tribunal keeping in mind the earlier opinion dated 31.08.2017 in the
light of the decision in Abdul Kuddus (supra).
    Only when the Tribunal comes to a finding that the present proceedee is not the same
person who was proceeded and was found to be an Indian in F.T.(D) Case No.8312/2012, the
impugned order will be revived and the order of the Tribunal can be challenged by the
petitioner both on the issue of identity of the petitioner and other grounds raised in this
9.    In view of above, without entering in the merit of the case we remand the matter to the
Foreigners Tribunal, Tezpur (1st), Sonitpur, Assam by setting aside the impugned order
31.12.2020 passed by the Foreigners Tribunal, Tezpur No.1, Assam, in F.T.(D) Case
No.3512/2012 to examine whether the petitioner is the same person who was proceded in
F.T.(D) Case No.8312/2012by the Foreigners Tribunal, Tezpur 1 st, Sonitpur. The Foreigners
Tribunal Tezpur No.1, Sonitpur shall decide first as to whether the petitioner is the same
person who was proceeded in F.T.(D) Case No.8312/2012 or not, for which the petitioner
shall appear before the Foreigners Tribunal on 14.02.2022 to enable the Tribunal to examine
that he is the same person who was proceeded in F.T.(D) Case No.8312/2012 .
10.       Accordingly, this shall be the preliminary issue which is to be decided by the
Foreigners Tribunal 1st Tezpur, in F.T.(D) Case No.3512/2012 as to whether the present
proceedee is the same person who was earlier declared an Indian Citizen in F.T.(D) Case
No.8312/2012 by the Foreigners Tribunal Tezpur (1 st), Sonitpur and if it is found that the
petitioner is the same person who was proceeded in F.T.(D) Case No.8312/2012 by the
Foreigners Tribunal Tezpur (1st), Sonitpur, the present proceeding shall immediately be
concluded in favour of the petitioner on the basis of the order passed in F.T.(D) Case
No.8312/2012 on 31.08.2017 where the petitioner was declared an Indian citizen.
      If, however, the decision is otherwise, the petitioner will be at liberty to challenge this
opinion as well as the other findings by approaching this Court again.
11.    It is made clear that since the nationality of the petitioner is already under cloud, he
will remain on bail on furnishing a bail bond of Rs. 5,000/- (Rupees five thousand) with one
local surety of the like amount to the satisfaction of the Superintendent of Police (Border),
Sonitpur during the pendency of the proceeding before the Tribunal. The concerned
Superintendent of Police (Border) shall also take steps for capturing the fingerprints and
biometrics of the iris of the petitioner. The petitioner also shall not leave the jurisdiction of
Sonitpur district without furnishing the details of the place of destination and necessary
information including contact number to the Superintendent of Police (Border), Sonitpur.
12.    With the above observations and directions, the writ petition stands disposed of.
13.    Copy of this order be furnished to the Superintendent of Police (B), Sonitpur for doing
the needful.
