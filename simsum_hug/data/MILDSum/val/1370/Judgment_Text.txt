1.     Feeling aggrieved with and dissatisfied by the judgment and
order dated 7th September, 2021 passed by the Family Court,
Mumbai dismissing Petition No. A - 2860 of 2017 filed for annulment
of marriage under section 12 (1) (c) of the Hindu Marriage Act,
1955, appellant-wife has filed this appeal.
2.     Shorn of unnecessary details, facts germane for disposal of this
appeal can be summarized as follows. The case has chequered
3.     Appellant and respondent are Hindus. Appellant is qualified as
a Master of Science from Singhania University, Rajasthan. She is
gainfully employed as an officer in Union Bank of India, Mumbai.
Appellant is unaware of respondent's age, educational qualification
and employment details.
4.     In the month of January-February, 2003, when appellant was
aged about 14 to 15 years and prosecuting her studies in 10th
standard, respondent had forcibly made physical contact with her
and took obscene photographs. Respondent threatened her of dire
consequences and also to her family members if she disclosed about
the act of respondent and photographs. Respondent threatened her
that if appellant utters even a single word about the incident to
anyone, he would spoil her reputation by making obscene
photographs viral on social media and on internet. Appellant silently
suffered the ordeal as she belongs to a very orthodox family from the
State of Haryana where custom of Khap Panchayat prevails.
5.     Appellant's father came to be transferred from Bilaspur to
Chhachharauli and, thereafter, appellant was not in contact with
respondent till 2006.
6.     In 2007, when appellant was studying at Yamuna Nagar,
respondent again started harassing her by stalking and reminding her
of obscene photographs, inter alia, threatening her to make it viral
and damage reputation of her family, if she does not submit to his
7.     Being afraid of respondent's notorious nature, appellant was
forced to submit herself to his whims and fancies till the year 2008.
After her graduation, appellant went back to her native place at
Narnaul to pursue higher education.
8.     In 2010, when appellant returned to Yamuna Nagar, respondent
started threatening her to marry and stay with him, else, he would
disfigure her by throwing acid. He again threatened to defame
appellant and her family. It is contended that respondent was so
emboldened that he started physically assaulting, insulting and abusing
appellant in public and, on one such occasion, in the year 2011, when
appellant was working as a teacher at a Coaching Centre, respondent
slapped her in front of her colleagues only because she declined to go
out with him. Acts of respondent to threaten and torment appellant
with dire consequences to her and her family's life, continued unabated.
9.     It is averred that in the month of November, 2011, appellant
joined Punjab National Bank and was working as a Single Window
Operator (Clerk) at it's branch situate in Village Dhanora. She was
staying in PG accommodation in the same village.           Taking undue
advantage of her loneliness, respondent kept pressurizing her to get
married to him.
10.    Appellant has further quoted an incident alleged to have
occurred on 28th December, 2011 when respondent rang up her
office number and asked her to come out of the branch. Upon her
refusal, he threatened to crate a scene inside the branch office and
spoil her reputation. When appellant came out, respondent snatched
her cell phone and forcibly took her in his car. On the way, he gave
her some "prasad" to eat, which appellant later on realized that it
was spiked with some drugs, as after consuming said " prasad",
appellant became powerless and mute spectator to the events that
unfolded thereafter. Appellant remembered that respondent picked
up his friends on the way and later took her to a temple and clicked
some photographs. Later, respondent and his friends made her sign
some blank papers and only after she signed the blank papers,
respondent dropped her at her office on the next day, i.e, on 29th
December, 2011 at about 10'0 clock. Before leaving appellant at her
office, respondent threatened her not to reveal about the incident to
anyone, else, they would cause serious harm to her and her family.
11.    In the month of March, 2012, appellant was selected by Union
Bank of India and was asked to join Goregaon West branch in
Mumbai in April, 2012. Appellant came to Mumbai on 5th April,
2012 and took temporary accommodation at her aunt's house in
Andheri for a month or so. Having gained information of appellant's
appointment in Mumbai, respondent followed her and took up a
residence in the same locality. Respondent approached appellant's
office at Nariman Point and forced her to come out of the office by
insisting upon her to live with him in Mumbai.           He took her to
Gateway of India. Appellant, however, refused all the proposals of
respondent which infuriated him. He again threatened her to make
viral her obscene photographs and also with dire consequences.
12.     Respondent left Mumbai on 15th April, 2012 after threatening
her that if she refuses to accept his proposal to reside in Mumbai with
him, he would kill her parents in Haryana. Due to such threats by
respondent, appellant called upon her parents to Mumbai who were
initially reluctant, however, her parents came to Mumbai on 28th
April, 2012.     Appellant could not gather courage to apprise her
parents about threats and ugly deeds of respondent. Due to their
responsibilities back in Haryana, her parents could not stay in
Mumbai. Appellant had to request her parents to take an
independent house in Mumbai for her stay. Accordingly, a flat was
finalized on lease in Goregaon.        A lease agreement came to be
executed on 2nd May, 2012. Thereafter, her parents left for Haryana
in the first week of May, 2012.
13.     Having learnt about their return to Haryana, respondent came
to Mumbai and again started repeating the same things. Appellant
thereafter created an excuse that since her aunt was not keeping
well, she was required to be with her and, therefore, she would keep
her rented flat locked, as owner of the flat had strictly instructed her
that nobody will reside in the rented flat during her absence.
However, respondent left only after extorting Rs.10,000/- from
appellant. Similarly, he extorted Rs.10,000/- from her on 19th June,
14.     In order to ensure safety of her family at all costs, she was
undergoing the ordeal as she had no way out. Appellant feared that
respondent and his accomplices had the ability to put their threats
into reality.
15.     Appellant thereafter gives details of similar incidents            that
occurred during her stay in Mumbai, especially when her sister
visited her for 20 days from 20th June, 2012 to 10th July, 2012. On
one occasion, respondent had demanded keys of her flat when her
sister left for her native place. Appellant gave him keys, but made up
a story that she was staying with her aunt who was undergoing
chemotherapy, inter alia, informing respondent that if owner of the
house found that he is staying alone in the flat, then she would be
forced to quit the premises. Respondent thereupon abused appellant
and agreed to leave Mumbai only after she paid Rs.5,000/- for his
16.     In the first week of August, 2012, one night, respondent
surfaced drunk at her rented house. However, appellant immediately
booked her tickets for her native on the very next day and informed
respondent      that   she    had   to   reach   Haryana         to     attend
"Rakshabandhan" and family functions. Respondent forced her to buy
tickets for him also and he too accompanied her to Haryana.
17.    Appellant further contends that during September, 2012,
respondent's family started pressurizing appellant to perform
registered marriage and started blackmailing her of social stigma and
disgrace that can befall on her family if respondent starts revealing
the indecent lifestyle of appellant in the society. Appellant tried her
best to convince the family members of respondent, especially his
parents, sister Sudesh, brother Ajay and sister-in-law about her
sufferings at the hands of respondent and of the trauma and tyranny
that respondent heaped upon her for about last 14 years. However,
they did not pay any heed, and, instead, forced her to perform a
registered marriage with respondent.
18.    Sometime in the month of March, 2013, her parents and
relatives came to Mumbai for shopping as her sister's wedding was to
be solemnized. During that period, respondent kept calling and
abusing appellant, for, she had invited her family members to reside
in Mumbai. Appellant had given her debit card to respondent which
was being misused by him. However, appellant did not mind as it was a
negligible price that she was paying for being left alone. In the last
week of March, 2013, respondent again started keeping watch on her
movements and had also physically abused her during the first week of
April, 2013.   Respondent thereafter stayed with her in April, 2013.
During second week of May, 2013, appellant's brothers stayed with her
in Mumbai till 20th June, 2013.
19.    According to appellant, in September, 2013, her parents again
came to Mumbai. They went to Shirdi on a pilgrimage for two days.
Appellant was alone at home as her housemaid had also absented
herself. By taking undue advantage of the said situation, respondent
physically abused her in an unnatural manner. As such, appellant was
in complete mental and physical trauma due to frequent instances of
physical, mental and psychological abuse by respondent. Her parents
had no knowledge of any such atrocities on her. Appellant thereafter
cancelled the debit card in the month of November 2013 which was
being used by respondent. Such cancellation infuriated respondent
who called and asked her to send monies as respondent wanted to
make preparation for their wedding and insisted upon a registered
marriage. Appellant, however, did not pay any heed to his demands.
At one point of time, appellant had lost all her strength to tolerate
respondent and even contemplated to commit suicide rather than
living in such hellish condition created by the respondent, however,
spiritual guidance stopped her from taking any step.
20.      On 3rd December, 2013, respondent came to appellant's office
and snatched her mobile phone as well as her debit card. In order to
avoid fracas in her office, appellant went out of her office where
respondent followed and threatened her to immediately accompany
him to his native place Bilaspur, or else, he would            kill and/or
disfigure her. Appellant called her parents and informed them for the
first time about respondent and his crimes.
21.     Appellant's parents lodged a telephonic complaint from
Haryana on 3rd December, 2013 with Goregaon Police Station. When
respondent came to know about the same, he returned her mobile
and debit card. He, however, threatened appellant not to proceed with
any complaint as he was not afraid of going to jail. However, when he
would be free, he would actually hurt her and her family members.
22.    Appellant contends that Goregaon Police Station was not keen
to register an F.I.R in the matter at that time. In order to counterblast
appellant's complaint with Goregaon Police Station, respondent took
advice from his family and friends and schemed to misuse law in
order to harass and subdue appellant by filing an application for
restitution of conjugal rights in the Court of Civil Judge at Bilaspur
on 17th January, 2014 under section 9 of the Hindu Marriage Act.
Appellant was shocked, as for the first time, she came to know that
respondent claimed to be her alleged husband.
23.    It is further averred that till March, 2014, respondent kept
silent. Realizing appellant had not pursued her complaint, he again
started harassing her in the similar manner. Apart from him, his
lawyer, friends and family members also started threatening her to
accept respondent as her husband. Despite blocking several cell
numbers, respondent and his family continued calling on her cell
phone and office lines from unknown numbers and continued
threatening and torturing her mentally.
24.     On 10th July, 2014, respondent called appellant on landline
number of her Union Bank of India Office and threatened her that if
she does not stay with him, he would destroy her life by throwing
acid on her face so that no one else would ever marry her. He again
threatened to make viral her obscene photographs on social media.
25.    Appellant, therefore, filed a complaint vide her Advocate's
letter dated 11th July, 2014 with Goregaon Police Station. A crime
bearing No.254 of 2014 came to be registered against respondent
under section 376, 366, 354, 506 (2) of the Indian Penal Code and
under section 4 of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences
Act, 2012 on 12th July, 2014.
26.    Appellant had filed her say in the application bearing No.2 of
2014 filed by respondent before Additional Civil Judge at Bilaspur for
restitution of conjugal rights.     Respondent was arrested on 23rd
December, 2014 by Bilaspur Police in the aforesaid crime, however,
he was enlarged on bail in the first week of February, 2015.
Respondent, however, again started threatening appellant to
withdraw her complaint.
27.    According to appellant, she hails from rural background where
womenfolk and their voices are stifled from birth as the slightest
rumour can taint them for rest of their lives. Honour killings, rape
and all kinds of crimes against women are a daily feature and
families advise their daughters and womenfolk to silently face
oppression. F.I.R's are rarely filed in cases of crimes against women,
unless, there is a press coverage or political support where, Khap
Panchayat's rule and their diktat goes unquestioned, and whoever
agitates, are either ex-communicated or liquidated.
28.    Respondent took advantage of such state of affairs and ruined
her life. Only because appellant got transferred to Mumbai during
April, 2012, she was able to fight for justice from December, 2013 till
date. She further contends that respondent took complete advantage
of her shy, timid and introverted nature and kept her terrorized ever
since she was 14 years old and the ordeal that appellant has had
undergone since December, 2011 to December, 2013 has left a lasting
impact upon her mind and soul to such an extent that she would
have either ended her life or would have been liquidated by
29.    Appellant contends that she was never married nor there was
any marriage conducted between her and respondent. Certificate and
other documents relied upon by respondent in Petition No. A -2172
of 2016, originally filed as Application bearing No.2 of 2014 before
Additional Civil Judge at Bilaspur on 17th January, 2014 are
fabricated documents prepared by respondent to serve his criminal
agenda of committing crimes upon appellant as above. Respondent
entered into a criminal conspiracy with his friends in order to fulfill
his criminal desire of criminally enslaving appellant for the rest of
her life. Respondent had fabricated a certificate which he claims to be
an alleged marriage certificate and also an affidavit which had been
obtained by using criminal force/fraud. Even, alleged signatures of
appellant were obtained through fraud, coercion and criminal
pressure. It is contended that appellant came to know about
fabricated and fraudulent documents of her alleged marriage with
respondent for the first time when respondent filed an application
under section 9 of the Hindu Marriage Act, as he kept those documents
and certificates suppressed.
30.    Appellant, therefore, prays for annulment of her alleged
marriage dated 29th December, 2011 stated to have been performed/
took place at Rishi Markandeshwar Dhan Smiti by a decree of
annulment, inter alia, seeking some other reliefs. As such, it is the
contention of appellant that on the basis of such false, forged and
fabricated documents, respondent has ruined her life and she has
been entrapped, tricked and entangled by him in order to continue
enslaving her and to prevent her from settling in her life.
31.     Respondent appeared before the Family Court, however, he
failed to file written statement and, therefore, petition proceeded
against him without written statement.
32.    We heard Mr. Firdause Irani, Counsel appearing for appellant
for a considerable period. At the outset, Mr. Irani would argue that
impugned order is ex facie illegal, contrary to the provisions of law
and is unsupported by the evidence on record. He would argue that
impugned order is based on incorrect appreciation of law and facts,
inasmuch as, the Court below erred in appreciating a fact that
appellant was under huge criminal force and has been suffering for
more than 18 long years of her ordeal wherein          respondent had
wielded money, muscle and political power against her. He would
argue that the learned Judge failed in considering the forged,
fabricated documents and marriage certificate relied upon by
respondent in his petition under section 9 of the Act. Counsel has
invited our attention to a fact that despite service, respondent did
not appear before the Family Court, and, therefore, evidence adduced
by appellant remained uncontroverted. Counsel emphasized on a fact
that appellant had been sexually exploited by respondent ever since
she was 14 years old and continued exploiting her physically,
mentally and economically by sheer use of criminal force and threats.
33.    According to Mr. Irani, learned Judge erred in technically
deducing the calculation of limitation to file annulment proceedings
by wrongly observing that since appellant first came to know about
force in 2014 and then F.I.R came to be filed in 2015 and as such,
suit that came to be filed in the year 2017 was barred by limitation.
Counsel would, therefore, argue that impugned judgment and order
rendered by the learned Judge of the Family Court needs interference
in appeal. Counsel would further submit that matter needs to be
remanded for passing necessary orders, in accordance with law.
34.     A short affidavit in lieu of her examination-in-chief had been
tendered by appellant before the Family Court which is not in full
consonance with what has been averred in the petition, in the sense,
it does not exhibit, in detail particulars, various instances alleged to
have occurred from the year 2003 when appellant alleged to have
been sexually exploited by respondent till 2013. Be that as it may.
35.     Appellant has sought two fold reliefs viz;
(a)    Alleged marriage dated 29th December, 2011
alleged    to   have     been   solemnized      at     Rishi
Markandeshwar Dhan Smiti with respondent be
annulled by a decree of nullity on the ground of fraud,
(b)    Marriage certificate dated 29th December, 2011
issued by Rishi Markandeshwar Dhan Smiti and
alleged affidavits be declared as false and forged
documents; being non est, null and void ab initio.
36.     Indubitably, petition under section 9 of the Act preferred by
respondent on 17th July, 2014 for restitution of conjugal rights in the
Court of Additional Civil Judge, Bilaspur, which ultimately came to
be transferred to Family Court, Mumbai, came to be dismissed
(Petition No. A - 2172 of 2016) for want of prosecution by the Family
Court on 23rd January, 2018.
37.    Before evaluating the evidence on record, one must understand
that a Hindu marriage under the Act must be solemnized in
accordance with the customary rites and ceremonies of at least one
of the parties thereto and must fulfill the conditions prescribed for
the same. A marriage between Hindus must be either a civil marriage
or a sacramental marriage and the requisite of a sacramental
marriage, apart from other conditions, was that it must be
solemnized in accordance with such customary rites and ceremonies
of either party thereto as are essential for such marriage. Of course,
there must be consensus of the parties to the solemnisation of the
marriage. This element of consent was present even in the concept
of a Hindu marriage being entirely a sacrament and a gift because it
was an indispensable part of the ceremony that the gift should be
38.    Section 12 (1) (c) rules that a marriage shall be voidable and
may be annulled by a decree of nullity on the ground that the
consent of the petitioner,    (or of the guardian in marriage) was
obtained by force or fraud. A Hindu marriage under the Act, is not
entirely or necessarily a sacrament ( sanskara) but union of one man
with one woman to the exclusion of others, satisfied by solemnisation
of the customary rites and ceremonies of either party essential for a
marriage, as it directly exists, creates a relation and a status not
imposed or defined by contract but by law.          There must be no
incapacity in the parties to marry one another by reason of prohibited
relationship or sapinda relationship. A "Hindu marriage' does not
refer to Hinduism as a religion but it relates to all persons who are
Hindus in the wide connotation of the expression. Appellant herein,
has come up with a specific contention that not only fraud but force
had been exercised by respondent in obtaining her consent for the
marriage qua the manner and mode in which the alleged marriage is
said to have been solemnized.
39.    Having said that, it would be expedient to scan evidence of
appellant in the form of an affidavit. Appellant and respondent knew
each other since the year 2000. Appellant states in her affidavit that
in the year 2003 when she was 14 or 15 years of age and prosecuting
her studies in 10th standard, respondent had forcibly made physical
contact with her and took obscene photographs. At that time, she
was residing with her parents at Bilaspur.   Respondent was residing
in the neighbourhood. Respondent threatened appellant of dire
consequences and also to her family members if she discloses about
the said act and the photographs to anyone. Respondent had also
threatened to spoil her reputation by making obscene photographs
viral on social media and on internet. Appellant had silently suffered
the ordeal as she belongs to a very orthodox family from the State of
Haryana where custom of Khap Panchayat prevails. Thereafter in the
year 2007, when appellant was studying at Yamunanagar after her
father's transfer from Bilaspur to Chhachharauli, respondent again
started harassing her by stalking and reminding her of obscene
photographs, inter alia, threatening her to make it viral and would
damage reputation of her family, if she does not submit to his
40.     If it is presumed that appellant was molested or sexually
exploited when she was in 10th standard and was 14 to 15 years of
age, by 2007 she must have attained 18 years, however, neither she
had disclosed alleged acts of respondent to her parents, siblings nor
to any of the family members. Apprehension of appellant that she
was afraid of notorious nature of respondent who had forced her to
submit herself to his whims and fancies sounds incredible. For a
moment, apprehension of appellant at that age is presumed to be
justified, looking to her tender age, she could have definitely
confided with her mother about it.
41.     It appears that appellant had succumbed to the alleged torture
and harassment at the hands of respondent from the year 2007 to
2010 at Yamunanagar. Even after her return to Yamunanagar, she
states that respondent started threatening her to marry and stay
with him, else, he would disfigure her by throwing acid. He started
threatening appellant in the similar manner, so much so, that he was
so emboldened that he started physically assaulting, insulting her in
public. On one occasion in the year 2011 when appellant was
working as a teacher in a Coaching Centre, respondent slapped her in
front of her colleagues only because she declined to go out with him.
Even then, quite surprisingly appellant had neither complained either
to her parents or to the Police which sounds incredible.
42.     Respondent had continued exerting criminal pressure upon
appellant to get married with him when she was working as a Clerk
in Punjab National Bank at it's branch situate in village Dhanora and
residing in PG accommodation in the month of November, 2011.
Thereafter, in the month of December, 2011, respondent rang up
appellant's office number and asked her to come out of the branch,
when she refused, he threatened her to create a scene inside the
branch office and spoil her reputation. When appellant came out,
respondent snatched her cell phone and forcibly took her in his car.
On the way, he gave her some "prasad" to eat which, according to
appellant, she later realized that it was spiked with some drugs, as
after consuming the same, she became powerless and mute spectator
to the events that unfolded thereafter. According to appellant,
respondent along with some of his friends took her to a temple and
clicked some photographs. Thereafter, her signatures were obtained
on some blank papers. Thereafter, she was dropped at her office on
the following day, i.e, on 29th December, 2011 at 10'0' clock. Before
leaving appellant at her office, respondent threatened her not to
reveal about the incident to anyone, else, they would cause serious
harm to her and her family.
43.    We are afraid, we cannot believe such evidence of appellant as
it is difficult to accept the same to be a truthful version of the
incident. It is so because as to how she readily accepted "prasad" and
ate it despite having been forcibly taken away by respondent?
Appellant was literally abducted and again brought back to the office
on the following day but neither any of her colleagues or friends
have come forward to depose in her favour nor there appears to be
any report lodged by her with Police. Strangely, appellant remained
silent and passive despite undergoing such a trauma. It is
unfathomable as to why she did not disclose the said incident to her
friends or colleagues who could have definitely taken some effective
steps by approaching the Police or at least to the superior officers.
Such behaviour of appellant is quite strange and cannot be said to be
a natural conduct of a woman who is not only major but qualified as
a Master in Science from Singhania University and serving
independently in a city like Mumbai. No sane man will believe and
accept her statement.
44.   Next, while serving with Union Bank of India in the month of
March, 2012 at Goregaon West Branch in Mumbai, it is stated that
she took a temporary accommodation in her aunt's house at Andheri
for a month.    Having learnt about her appointment in Mumbai,
respondent followed her and took up a residence in the same locality.
He even approached her office at Nariman Point and forced her to
come out of the office by insisting upon her to live with him in
Mumbai. Upon her refusal, he extended similar threats of making
her obscene photographs viral and spoiling her life as well as causing
damage to her life and limb. This time also, appellant silently
suffered without disclosing conduct of respondent to anyone. Could
she not disclose it with her parents when they had been to Mumbai
45.   Appellant further states that whenever she used to be alone,
respondent would abuse her physically in unnatural manner and
would always extort money from her by unlawfully using her debit
card. He had extorted Rs.1,40,000/- during the period from May,
2012 to December, 2012. However, she could gather courage
thereafter and cancelled her debit card. Finally, she informed her
parents regarding the acts, threats and torture by respondent and
thereafter her parents lodged a telephonic report against him with
Goregaon Police Station on 3rd December, 2013. Upon realizing that
a report came to be lodged against him, respondent filed an
application bearing No.2 of 2014 before the Additional Sessions
Judge, Bilaspur on 17th January, 2014 for restitution of conjugal
rights by relying upon a forged marriage certificate and fabricated
documents. It is pertinent to note that there is no whisper in her
petition as regards forged and fabricated documents being relied
upon by respondent in his suit for restitution of conjugal rights or,
that her marriage was solemnized under fraud or force. One does not
know whether in her reply or written statement in the suit of
respondent for restitution of conjugal rights, any such plea was
raised? In her affidavit, she further deposed that respondent, his
friends and family continued threatening her and, therefore, she
lodged a report with Goregaon Police Station on 11th July, 2014 vide
C.R. No.254 of 2014 under section 376 (N), 366, 354 (K), 506 (2) of
the Indian Penal Code and under section 4 of the POCSO Act.
46.    It is crystal clear from the evidence of appellant that except
her bare words, there is absolutely no corroboration from any corner
either in the form of evidence of her parents, brothers, sisters or
employees of Union Bank of India. There is even no evidence as
regards alleged extortion of substantial amount by misusing her debit
card which could have been easily available being electronic
evidence.     Even there is no evidence of medical examination of
appellant who alleged to have been ravished, sexually exploited and
subjected to unnatural intercourse by respondent. Overall evidence
of appellant is improbable, unbelievable and unacceptable. No sane
man would believe and accept her testimony as it is nothing but
ipsedixitism. It is quite apparent from the evidence that it is a case of
inflicted insight, meaning thereby, unsolicited revelation of aspects of
one's character, usually as a result of a deceitful experiment that has
psychological dimensions, and especially where this results in
emotional trauma.
47.    Learned Judge of the Family Court has, therefore, rightly
refused to place reliance upon the sole testimony of appellant which
suffers from several shortcomings and is insufficient to construe that
there was any force or fraud alleged to have been played upon her by
respondent      who     had   forcibly   obtained     her     signature      and
photographs. There are no photographs on record. Certain photostat
copies of affidavits annexed with memo of appeal cannot be
considered in evidence for want of originals.
48.    Now, turning to the legal aspects qua section 12 (1) (c) of the
Act. Section 12 of the Act contemplates that any marriage
solemnized, whether before or after the commencement of this Act,
shall be viodable and may be annulled by a decree of nullity on any
of the following grounds, namely:-
where the consent of the guardian in marriage of
the petitioner was required under Section 5 as it
stood immediately before the commencement of
the Child Marriage Restraint (Amendment) Act,
1978 (2 of 1978), the consent of such guardian
was obtained by force or by fraud as to the nature
of the ceremony or as to any material fact or
sub-section (1), no petition for annulling a
(a)       on the ground specified in clause (c) of
year after the force had ceased to operate or, as
the case may be, the fraud had been discovered;
49.    Learned Counsel for appellant emphasized on the words,
"force" and "fraud" appearing in section 12 (1) (c) of the Act. Said
words must be interpreted in such circumstances or conditions as to
show want of real consent to the marriage. "Fraud" within the
meaning of section 12 (1) (c) is such which procures the appearance
without the reality of consent and thereby becomes an act fitted to
deceive. The word "fraud" employed in this section does not speak of
fraud in any general way, nor does it mean every misrepresentation
or concealment, which may be fraudulent, but fraud as to the nature
of ceremony or as to the material fact or circumstances concerning
respondent. Another meaning which can be attributed to word
"fraud" is "deceit", meaning thereby, where consent to the marriage
has been obtained by deceit or deception, it is liable to be annulled
under section 12 (1) (c) of the Act.
50.    Sub-section (2) of Section 12 of the Act contemplates that
notwithstanding anything contained in sub-section-1, no petition for
annulling the marriage on the ground specified in clause (c) of sub-
section (1) shall be entertained if the petition is presented more than
one year after the force has ceased to operate or, as the case may be,
the fraud had been discovered. Thus, presentation of petition for
annulling the marriage as void under section 12 (1) (c) must be
within one year from the date after the force has ceased to operate
or, the date the fraud had been discovered. Sine qua non for valid
presentation of the petition is, therefore, presentation of petition
within one year from discovery of fraud or the force which                       had
ceased to operate. This provision is imperative and prohibitory in
51.    Law on this point is no more res integra and has been dealt
with in several decisions of this Court as well as other High Courts.
It would be advantageous to refer to a decision of Chattisgarh High
Court in case of Renu Singh Vs. Brijendra Singh1. Relevant passage
from the judgment is extracted below:
"15. Sub-section (2) of Section 12 of the HM Act,
1955 states that notwithstanding anything contained
in sub-section (1), no petition for annulling a
marriage on the ground specified in clause (c) of sub-
section (1) shall be entertained if the petition is
presented more than one year after the force had
ceased to operate or, as the case may be, the fraud
had been discovered. Thus, presentation of petition
for annulling a marriage as void under Section 12 (1)
(c) must be within one year from the date after the
force had ceased to operate or, the date the fraud had
been discovered. Therefore, presentation of petition
within one year from discovery of fraud or the force
had ceased to operate is a sine qua non for valid
presentation of petition for annulment of marriage
under Section 12 (1) (c) of the HM Act, 1955. If the
petition is presented after more than one year from
that date, the bar would operate and suit would be
statutorily barred and as such the provision is
imperative and prohibitory in nature.
16. Even otherwise, the issue raised herein is no
longer res integra and stands concluded by a
judgment rendered by the M.P. High Court. In this
regard, reference may be to a Division Bench
decision of the M.P. High Court in Nandkishore
(supra) in which the M.P. High Court has held that a
petition for annulment of a marriage shall not be
entertained if the conditions laid down in various
sub- clauses of Section (2) of the HM Act, 1955 are
not satisfied, and observed as under in paragraph 11:
"11. Heading of this sub-section (2) would
clauses are not satisfied. It is, therefore,
incumbent on a petitioner to plead and for a
Court to find that the petitioner has strictly
fulfilled the requirements of those sub-clauses.
In order to succeed under clause (d) of
Section 12(1) of the Act, the petitioner must
not only show the existence of pregnancy at
that he was ignorant of that fact at the time of
marriage, that the proceedings were instituted
within a period of one year fixed by the statute
and that he did not have marital intercourse
the instant case, the marriage took place on 2-
5-1975.The petition was filed on 14-6-1976.
The summer vacation that year commenced
presented beyond the period of one year fixed
by the statute. Again, it is in the evidence of
the appellant and his witnesses that he had
respondent has specifically pleaded that after
the marriage she had marital intercourse with
the appellant and with his full consent. She
also deposed so in the witness-box. In spite of
this, the appellant did not amend the petition
to deny any cohabitation with the respondent.
The respondent was put no question in cross-
testimony. It can, therefore, be safely held that
marital intercourse had taken place with the
appellant's consent since discovery of the
Section 12(2)(b) (ii) and (iii) of the Act. His
petition must fail on this count also."
We are in respectful agreement with the view taken by Chattisgarh
52.    Turning back to the facts of the case at hand, as already
discussed hereinabove, on her own saying, appellant had first
discovered force also on 28th December, 2011 when she was
abducted by respondent from her office and took her in his car along
with his friends by offering some 'prasad' spiked with some drugs
which she ate and, thereafter, she was taken to a temple where some
photographs were clicked and her signatures were obtained on some
blank papers. Those papers, as it reflects from her evidence were
later converted into fabricated and forged documents in the form of
marriage certificate and affidavits.
53.     Fraud had been discovered qua nature of ceremony and also
force to accompany with respondent when she was offered some
'prasad' spiked with drugs on 29th December, 2011 when she was
dropped at her office. We have given various instances and analyased
appellant's case earlier from her petition and evidence only to expose
the unbelievable story of appellant. Even for a moment, we do not go
into the truthfulness and veracity of appellant's version as regards it's
correctness, we fail to understand as to why she did not do anything
and remained silent till 2017, i.e, almost for a period of six years.
If overall conduct of appellant vis-a-vis chronology of the events
unfolded on record are juxtaposed, it is quite difficult to construe
that there was any impediment or obstruction for her to approach
the Court within one year after she discovered fraud qua
nature of ceremony and also in respect of material facts and
circumstances in the nature of obtaining forged and fabricated
marriage certificate and affidavits by    respondent. Only inference
which would flow from the attending circumstances is that appellant
had acquiesced in the marriage.
54.     Evidence on record is not sufficient enough to infer that the
alleged marriage of appellant with respondent was an outcome of
practicing fraud or force as contended in the petition. The alleged
fraud or force had indeed ceased to operate, the moment appellant
came to know that she was deceitfully taken to a temple by offering
'prasad' spiked with some drugs and her signatures were obtained on
some blank papers. Having discovered the said fact on 29th
December, 2011, petition could have been presented within one year
thereafter. Nothing prevented her from doing so and, therefore, bar
under sub-section-2 of section 12 of the Act operates in the given
facts and circumstances.
55.    Corollary of the aforesaid discussion is that Hindu Marriage
Petition is hopelessly barred by limitation as rightly held by Family
Court, Bandra.     Appeal is devoid of merits.      No interference is
warranted in the impugned judgment and order. Appeal, therefore,
stands dismissed. No costs.
56.    Consequently, Interim Application stands disposed.
