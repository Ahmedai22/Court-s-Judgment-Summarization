1.        This Appeal under Section 23 of the
for    short)     questions    the    legality     and
correctness    of   order   dated  18th   July,   2014
passed   by  the   Railway   Claims    Tribunal    at
2.       Brief   reference    to   facts    may    be
necessary to assess the precise case of the
.    Damodar   Ganpat    Paygode    died    due    to
accidental   falling   from  the   train    carrying
passengers.     His   mother-   Lakshmibai,    wife-
Indubai and two sons-Kiran Paygode and Santosh
Paygode   (appellants herein), all “dependents”
within the meaning of Section 123(b) of the
Railways Act, 1989 were granted compensation
in the sum of Rs.4,00,000/-under Section 124A
of the Railways Act, 1989 by the Railway Claims
Tribunal,   at  Mumbai,   vide   order   dated   16th
March, 2009.    It appears, compensation in the
sum of Rs.1,54,994/- was awarded        to, Indubai
Damodar Paygode and Rs.1,00,000/- to Lakshmi
Ganpat Paygode.    However, before receiving the
compensation,   Lakshmibai    and   Indubai,    both
passed away on 2nd July, 2009 and 10th July,
2009.     Record   reveals,     compensation    amount,
sent  to   Indubai    and   Lakshmibai   by   post  was
returned “unclaimed”, reporting recipients were
dead.    It is appellant’s case that, due to
inadvertence, they did not lay their claim over
the    unclaimed       compensation.          In    the
circumstances,     the     appellants    moved    Misc.
Application No. 9/2014 purportedly filed under
Order 21 Rule 16 of the Code of Civil Procedure
read  with   Rule   26(1)    of  the  Railway    Claims
Rules” for short). Purport of the application
was that, after the death of Lakshmibai and
Indubai,       unclaimed         compensation         of
Rs.1,54,994/-       and       Rs.1,00,000/-       stood
transferred, to them, by ‘operation of law’,
being   legal    heirs     and   representatives      of
Indubai   and   Lakshmibai.        On  this    premise,
appellants   requested      the  Tribunal   to   direct
Railway Administration, to pay Rs.2,54,994/- to
them.   The learned Member of the Tribunal, vide
order   dated    18th   July,    2014   rejected    the
application on two grounds; namely, (I) that
application purportedly filed under Rule 26(1)
of the R.C.T. Rules was beyond the period of 90
days and (ii) since appellants have received
their share in compensation, they were no more
“dependents”.      Feeling aggrieved by that order,
this Appeal is preferred.
3.      Heard learned Counsel for the parties.
4.     Herein, Tribunal had granted compensation
to the appellants and Lakshmibai (grandmother
of   appellants)      and   Indubai     (mother     of   the
appellants).      Unfortunately,        Lakshmibai       and
Indubai died before receiving their share in
the   compensation.            In   the    circumstances,
appellants sought their impleadment as legal
representatives of Lakshmibai and Indubai and
accordingly moved an application under Rule 26
of the R.C.T. Rules, which reads as under :
“26. Substitution  of  legal representatives.-(1)In
the case of death of a party during the pendency of
the   proceedings    before    Tribunal,   the   legal
representatives  of   the  deceased  party  may  apply
within ninety days of the date of such death for
being brought on record.
(2)   Where  no  application   is  received  from  the
legal representatives within the period specified in
sub-rule (1), the proceedings shall abate:
Provided that for good and sufficient reasons
shown, the Tribunal may allow substitution of the
legal representatives of the deceased.”
That,     since     the    application        moved     by   the
appellants was beyond the period of 90 days,
and although the Tribunal is/was empowered to
condone      the    delay,     upon     showing     sufficient
cause,     delay      was     not    condoned.          Moreso,
Tribunal did not assign reasons, while refusing
to   condone      the   delay.        As   a   result,     Misc.
Application No.9/2014 was rejected.                   Any way,
Misc. Application was moved, for seeking two
(a)to      condone       the     delay       and     after
condoning it;
(b)to direct the Railway Administration to
pay  Rs.3,54,994/-,     the  amount    due   and
payable to Lakshmibai and Indubai to the
appellants,  being   their   heirs   and   legal
representatives.
.        From  the   proceedings,    three    facts
are    discernible,     (i)that     Miscellaneous
Application     was     moved     in     execution
proceedings; (ii)the unclaimed compensation,
then   payable   to  Lakshmibai     and   Indubai,
that, remained unpaid due to their untimely
death,   constitute    the   “estate”;    (iii)the
appellants would    claim estate of Lakshmibai
and   Indubai,   being   their   dependents     and
legal heirs.    Therefore, First question is,
Whether the appellants were entitled to seek
enforcement of compensation order passed in
favour of the deceased dependents ?; Second
question is “Whether the appellants-original
co-applicants and dependents would cease to
be the dependents upon receiving part of the
compensation awarded under Section 124A of
the   Railways    Act   and    third    question    is,
“Whether    the     Tribunal     is    empowered     to
execute    order     granting      compensation      in
respect of unclaimed amount due to deceased
dependents that remained unpaid.
5.        Insofar as, first two questions are
concerned,    it    is   not    in    dispute    that,
appellants are/were “dependents” within the
meaning of Section 123b of the Railways Act.
It   would   be   appropriate      to   notice   that,
language   of    Section   124    and   124A   imposes
liability on Railways to pay compensation.
Section 125(D) of the Railways Act, deals
with   claims    arising   in   respect     of  death,
which resulted from the accident or untoward
incidents.      In such a case, dependents of
deceased    alone    are   entitled      to   make   an
application for claim.          Thus, in the event
of death of passenger, only dependents and
not   mere  legal    heirs/legal     representatives
can   claim    compensation.      In   context    of
facts, somewhat similar question arose for
consideration in the case of Krishnakumar G.
V/s. Union of India before the Kerala High
Court. In that case, although the petitioner
was not the “dependent”, but sole legal heir
of   deceased   injured   passenger,    had  sought
recovery of amount that had fallen due under
Section 124 of the Railways Act and which
remained unpaid.      The Bench, after analysing
the scheme of Chapter-XIII of the Railways
Act, held that, “when the dependent of the
deceased,      is    given    right     to    claim
compensation by filing an application, the
expression “dependent” in the context, must
certainly   be    held  to  refer   to   those   who
represent     the    estate   of    the    deceased
dependent,      where     death    has     occurred
subsequent to vesting of right.        To construe
otherwise,     would    render   the     provision,
6.         In para-23 of the said judgment, the
Division Bench has held :
“23. In this context, we again note that there is no
specific stipulations in chapter-XIII of the Railways
Act as to what is to happen when the dependent of a
victim of an accident expires. The law is silent on
that aspect. Perhaps, more importantly, we must note
that there is no specific provision in Chapter-XIII
which can lead us to the inference that there would
be  abatement   or   extinction   of   the  claims   of   a
dependent on his death. While considering whether the
right to claim compensation under Section 124A read
with  Section  123(b)    and   125(d)  can   lead  to   the
conclusion that only the dependent and not the legal
heirs of the deceased dependent would be entitled to
claim compensation, it is important that we note that
there is no specific statutory stipulation suggesting
abatement or extinction of the claim in the event of
death of a dependent/claimant. The vested rights of a
dependent obviously cannot vanish into thin air or
disappear merely because death of the dependent takes
place. This is all the more so because we do not find
any provisions in Chapter- XIII which can suggest
that a dependent where the context so requires cannot
include the legal heirs of a deceased dependent.
7.         The Bench, thereafter had recourse to
Section 146 of the Code of Civil Procedure and
“27.   We  have    gone   through    all   the   statutory
stipulations in chapter-XIII. We are unable to find
any specific provision or any necessary implication
which can  suggest that      what can   be claimed    by a
dependent cannot be claimed (or his claim cannot be
continued)   by  the   legal   representatives  of   a
dependent. We conclude by holding that the expression
'dependent'  in  Section  125(1)(d)  must  necessarily
include the legal representative of the estate of the
deceased dependent, if such dependent prior to his
death is entitled to make such an application.
8.         I am in agreement with the ratio laid
down by the Division Bench of the Kerala High
Court    in   the    case    of   KrishnaKumar       (supra).
Therefore, it is to be held, the appellants
being     “dependents”        within     the     meaning     of
Section 123(b) of the Railways Act, it would be
absurd to hold that, they ceased to be the
dependents       upon     receiving        share     in     the
compensation         awarded       by      the      Tribunal.
Therefore, I hold, appellants were entitled to
recover the compensation that had fallen due to
Lakshmibai and Indubai, but remained unpaid.
The questions are answered accordingly.
9.   Insofar as, powers of the Railway Claims
Tribunal to execute the decree (third question)
is concerned, the scheme of the R.C.T. Rules,
provides that, once order granting compensation
is passed and signed by the Tribunal, it is
executable by the Tribunal in terms of sub-Rule
(2) of Rule 31 of the R.C.T. Rules, as a Decree
of Civil court and thereupon the provisions of
Civil Procedure Code, shall apply as they apply
in respect of a decree of Civil Court.          Rule
31A of the R.C.T. Rules, provides that an order
of the Tribunal may be executed by the Bench
which passed it, if the respondent is within
the territorial jurisdiction of the said Bench,
or by any other Bench or to Court to which it
is sent, for execution, when the respondent is
having    its   office   within   the   territorial
jurisdiction of such Bench or Court as the case
may be.    Rule 31B, prescribes an application to
be   made  to  the  Tribunal,   for  execution,    in
Form-IX; whereas, Section 22 of Railway Claims
Tribunal    Act,   empowers   Claims   Tribunal    to
execute its orders as a Decree of Civil Court
and for this purpose the Claims Tribunal is
invested with all powers of Civil Courts.          In
this   case,   appellants   are  claiming   that   by
operation     of     law    (Personal        Succession        Law),
they    are   the     'transferees',           of    compensation
payable to deceased, Lakshmibai and Indubai,
awarded by the R.C.T., vide order dated 16th
March, 2000.           Whereas, under Rule 26 of the
RCT Rules, legal representatives may seek their
impleadment in pending proceedings in case of
death     of    a   party      during       the      pendency      of
proceedings         before       the       Tribunal.              The
expression       “pendency         of    proceedings”          would
obviously       include        “execution           proceedings”.
Herein, the appellants were claiming that by
operation     of     law    (personal        succession        law),
they were transferees of the decree and                          thus
have    right     to    receive       compensation          due    to
deceased of Lakshmibai and Indubai, in terms of
Order 21 Rule 16 of the Civil Procedure Code,
which reads as under :
“O.21.R.16.    16.   Application      for     execution   by
transferee of decree.
Where  a  decree   or,  if   a  decree    has   been  passed
jointly  in   favour   of   two   or  more     persons,  the
interest  of   any   decree-holder     in   the   decree  in
transferred by assignment in writing or by operation
of law, the transferee may apply for execution of the
decree to the Court which passed if, and the decree
may be executed in the same manner and subject to the
same conditions as if the application were made by
such                                   decree-holder:
Provided  that, where the decree, or such interest as
aforesaid, has been transferred by assignment, notice
of such application shall be given to the transferor
and the judgment-debtor, and the decree shall not be
executed until the Court has heard their objections
(if any) to its execution:
Provided also that, where a decree for the payment of
money   against  two   or  more   persons   has  been
transferred to one of them, it shall not be executed
against the others.
[Explanation.- Nothing in this rule shall affect the
provisions of section 146, and a transferee of rights
in the property, which is the subject matter of the
suit, may apply for execution of the decree without a
separate assignment of the decree as required by this
rule.
10.        Thus,     upon     collective       reading     of
Section 123(b) of Railways Act with Rule 26 of
RCT rules with provisions of Order 21 Rule 16
of CPC, in my considered opinion, the Tribunal
is invested with powers to execute its order as
a Decree in accordance with the provisions of
the Civil Procedure Code.           In that view of the
matter,    Misc.    Application     No.9/2014    moved
under Rule 26(1) of the R.C.T. Rules, is to be
construed    as   an   application     in    execution
proceedings   made   under   Rule   31(2)   read  with
Section 22 of the R.C.T. Act.
11.    In    this     case,     Misc.     Application
No.9/2014 moved by the appellants was rejected,
having   found,   application     did   not   disclose
“sufficient cause”, to condone the delay.          Law
is, if sufficient cause is not proved, nothing
further    has to be done but, the application
for condoning the delay has to be dismissed on
that ground alone.      Yet, learned Tribunal held
and recorded finding that appellants were not
entitled to recover the amount due to Indubai
and Lakshmibai, reason being, upon receiving
their share in the compensation, they ceased to
be the “dependents”, without first examining
the Scheme of the Act and its powers.          Thereby
Tribunal,   fell   in  error   in   exercise   of  its
12.       In any case, having regard to the facts
of   the   case,  I  am  inclined   to   condone  the
delay.      Accordingly,   the  delay   is  condoned.
However, before concluding the Appeal, it may
be stated that, Miscellaneous Application moved
by    the    appellants,    was   in    capacity    as
“dependents” of deceased passenger and legal
representatives     of   Lakshmibai    and   Indubai.
Nextly,     every    application    moved    by   the
dependents for compensation under Section 124
is for the benefit of every other dependent in
terms of Section 125(2) of the Railways Act.
For the aforesaid reasons, the impugned order
dated 18th July, 2014 declining to condone the
delay      and    consequently      rejecting     the
Miscellaneous Application, is quashed and set
aside    and  Misc.   Application   No.   09/2014   is
restored to file.      As a consequence, Appeal is
partly allowed.     Hence, the following order :
(i) Misc. Application No. 09/2014 in
O.A. No.1222/2006 is restored to the
file of Railway Claims Tribunal at
Tribunal     shall      list          Misc.
consideration on 11th July, 2022 and
decide the same in accordance with
law, being mindful of its powers to
execute   its  order    as   a  decree    of
Civil   Court   and    fact    that   every
application    by    a    defendant      for
compensation   under     Section    124   or
124A of the Railways Act, 1989 is for
the benefit of every other defendant.
(iii)    The   Tribunal       shall     make
endeavour to decide the application
in  accordance    with    law   preferably
on/or    before    30th    August,    2022.
Registry to transmit the records and
proceedings in O.A. No.1222/2006 to
the Railway Claims Tribunal, Mumbai
(iv)   Parties    to   the   appeal   shall
appear    before    the   Railway    Claims
Tribunal on    11th July, 2022.
13.      Appeal is allowed and disposed of in
the aforesaid terms.
