2.    Heard    the    learned    counsel  appearing   for  the
petitioner and the learned High Court Government Pleader
appearing for the respondent.
3.    The factual matrix of the case of the prosecution is
that the petitioner-firm is a proprietorship concern engaged in
the catering business.      The petitioner â€“ firm is also registered
under the provisions of the Karnataka Sales Tax Act, 1957 and
Central Sales Tax Act, 1956.       It is also contended that the firm
is not earning any profit on sale of food in the Canteens such
sale is exempted under V schedule under entry 22 of the old
schedule and entry No.6 of the present V schedule. If the goods
are not liable to be taxed under the Act, such goods are brought
under Section 8 of the K.S.T. Act and such goods are exempt
from payment of tax. The petitioner also maintained the Books
of Accounts, as per the provisions of the KST Rules. However,
the assessing authority has concluded the assessment order for
the Assessment Year 2001-2002 vide order dated 25.02.2004
and the assessing authority comes to the conclusion that the
petitioner is liable to pay Sales Tax at 12% on sale of food
articles and accordingly levied a tax of Rs.35,25,376/-. In view
of the order passed under Section 12(3) of the KST Act, the
respondent has issued the demand notice in Form 6 and
demanded the said amount for the assessment year 2001-2002.
The respondent has granted 21 days time to pay the arrears of
tax.    On account of non-payment, petition was filed under
Section 13(3)(b) of the KST Act to recover the said amount. In
order to recover the said amount, the learned Special JMFC
(Sales Tax) Court vide order dated 26.07.2012, issued an order
through FLW through Commissioner, BBMP to attach and effect
encumbrance of amount mentioned in FLW to and for property
bearing No.14, Khatha 4/8 situated at Beratta Agrahara, Begur
Hobli.   Hence, the present Revision Petition is filed before the
4.    The    main  contention    of the   learned   counsel
appearing for the petitioner before this Court is that the learned
Special JMFC (Sales Tax) Court ought not to have issued the
order of attachment of property through BBMP Commissioner.
The learned counsel for the petitioner brought to the notice of
this Court that Section 421 of Cr.P.C., for Warrant for levy of
fine, particularly, clause (b) of Section 421, wherein, it is
specifically mentioned issue a warrant to the Collector of the
District, authorizing him to realize the amount as arrears of land
revenue from the movable or immovable property or both, of the
defaulter. Here is a case of issuing an order of attachment
through the BBMP Commissioner and he is not an authorized
officer to attach the property.
5.    Per contra, the learned High Court Government
Pleader appearing for the respondent would submit that when
the amount was not paid, the order was passed by the learned
Special JMFC (Sales Tax) Court, Bengaluru. Hence, there are no
grounds to allow the petition.
6.    Having heard the respective counsel and also on
perusal of the material available on record, no dispute with
regard to the fact that the recovery proceedings is initiated
based on the order. When the petition is filed before the learned
Special JMFC (Sales Tax) Court invoking Section 421 of Cr.P.C.,
issued the warrant and the same is as per Section 421(2) of
Cr.P.C., which says only the District Magistrate is empowered to
attach the property not the Commissioner, BBMP.       When such
being the case, the order requires an interference of this Court
since the Commissioner of BBMP., has no any authority to attach
the property as ordered by the Special JMFC (Sales Tax) Court
and the same can be enforced under Section 421(1)(b) of
Cr.P.C, through the collector of the District. Hence, it requires
an interference of this Court.
7.   In view of the discussions made above, I pass the
The petition is allowed. The order passed by the Special
JMFC (Sales Tax), Bengaluru in C.Misc.No.715/2004 dated
26.07.2012, is hereby set aside. The respondent is given liberty
to seek appropriate orders invoking Section 421(1)(b) of the
