Counsel for Applicant :- Siddhartha Mishra,Ali Hasan,Istiyaq
Counsel for Opposite Party :- G.A.
1.    Heard Mr. Daya Shankar Mishra, learned Senior Advocate
assisted by Mr. Abhishek Mishra, learned counsel for the
applicant and learned A.G.A. for the opposite party-State.
2.    The present criminal misc. bail application has been filed
on behalf of applicant- Wali Hasan to release him on bail in
Case No.1392 of 2019, under Sections 8, 20, 29, 60 and 3 of
3.    Learned Senior Counsel on behalf of the applicant
submitted that sub-Inspector lodged a first information report on
17.11.2019 against the applicant and two others with the
allegation that on the basis of information received, first
informant seized a truck on 17.11.2019 at 12:45 hours, which
was alleged to be driven by applicant and carrying 91 packets
of Ganja weighting about 201 K.G. He further submitted that 91
packets of alleged contraband (Ganja) in 8 Bags (Bora) was
alleged to be recovered from inside of truck but only 1 packet
weighting 1 K.G. (Ganja) out of 91 Packets was sent for
chemical examination so utmost 1 K.G. can be said to be Ganja
but remaining 200 K.G. cannot be said to be Ganja or any other
contraband unless there is proper sampling and its chemical
examination. He further submitted that it is not mentioned in the
recovery memo that from each 91 packets, sample of alleged
contraband     (Ganja)     was taken         and     sent    for  chemical
examination, as such, the procedure of sampling adopted by
the police authority is in violation of Standing Order / Instruction
No.1 of 1989 dated 13.6.1989 issued by the Government of
India under Section 52 A of N.D.P.S. Act. He has placed
reliance upon Clause 2.1 to 2.8 of Standing Order / Instruction
No.1 of 1989, which are as follows:
2.1 All drugs shall be classified, carefully, weighed and sampled
on the spot of seizure.
2.2 All the packages/containers shall be numbered and kept in
lots for sampling. Samples from the narcotic drugs and
psychotropic substances seized, shall be drawn on the spot of
recovery, in duplicate, in the presence of search witnesses
(Panchas) and the persons from whose possession the drug is
recovered and a mention to this effect should invariably be
made in the panchnama drawn on the spot.
2.3 The quantity to be drawn in each sample for chemical test
shall not be less than 5 grams in respect of all narcotic drugs
and psychotropic substances save in the cases of opium, ganja
and charas (hashish) were a quantity of 24 grams in each case
is required for chemical test. The same quantities shall be taken
for the duplicate sample also. The seized drugs in the
packages/containers      shall   be   well    mixed   to  make  it
homogeneous and representative before the sample (in
duplicate) is drawn.
2.4 In the case of seizure of a single package/container, one
sample in duplicate shall be drawn. Normally, it is advisable to
draw one sample (in duplicate) from each package/container in
case of seizure of more than one package/container.
2.5 However, when the packages/containers seized together
are of identical size and weight, bearing identical markings and
the contents of each package given identical results on colour
test by the drug identification kit, conclusively indicating that the
packages are identical in all respects the packages/container
may be carefully bunched in lots of 10 package/containers
except in the case of ganja and hashish (charas), where it may
be bunched in lots of, 40 such packages/containers. For each
such lot of packages/containers, one sample (in duplicate) may
be drawn.
2.6 Where after making such lots, in the case of hashish and
ganja, less than 20 packages/containers remain, and in the
case of other drugs, less than 5 packages/containers remain,
no bunching would be necessary and no samples need be
drawn.
2.7 If such remainder is 5 or more in the case of other drugs
and substances and 20 or more in the case of ganja and
hashish, one more sample (in duplicate) may be drawn for such
remainder package/container.
2.8 While drawing one sample (in duplicate) from a particular
lot, it must be ensured that representative sample the in equal
quantity is taken from each package/container of that lot and
mixed together to make a composite whole from which the
samples are drawn for that lot.
4.    He next submitted that there is no evidence on record
regarding taking of samples as provided in standing order /
instructions mentioned above, as such, taking of proper sample
is highly doubtful.
5.    On the point of sampling of contraband, learned counsel
placed reliance upon following judgments and orders:
(i) Phool Chand Ali Vs. Union of India reported in 2020
(ii) Om Prakash Verma Vs. State of U.P. reported in
(iii) Amrik Singh Vs. State of U.P. order dated 9.1.2014
passed in Criminal Appeal No.1106 of 2013
(iv) Gaunter Edwin Kircher Vs. State of Goa reported
6.    Learned counsel for applicant further submitted that
standing instruction and the guidelines issued by the authority
having legal sanction are required to be strictly followed by the
police / arresting authorities as held by the Apex Court in the
case of Noor Aga Vs. State of Punjab (2008) 3 JIC 640 (S.C.),
the paragraph nos.123, 124 and 125 of the judgment are as
123. Guidelines issued should not only be substantially
complied, but also in a case involving penal proceedings,
vis-`-vis a departmental proceeding, rigours of such
guidelines may be insisted upon. Another important factor
which must be borne in mind is as to whether such
directions have been issued in terms of the provisions of
the statute or not. When directions are issued by an
authority having the legal sanction granted therefor, it
becomes obligatory on the part of the subordinate
authorities to comply therewith.
124. Recently, this Court in State of Kerala & Ors. v.
following the earlier decision of this Court in Union of India
v. Azadi Bachao Andolan [(2004) 10 SCC 1] held that
statutory instructions are mandatory in nature.
125. Logical corollary of these discussions is that the
guidelines such as those present in the Standing Order
cannot be blatantly flouted and substantial compliance
therewith must be insisted upon for so that sanctity of
physical evidence in such cases remains intact. Clearly,
there has been no substantial compliance of these
guidelines by the investigating authority which leads to
drawing of an adverse inference against them to the effect
that had such evidence been produced, the same would
have gone against the prosecution.”
7.     Learned counsel further submitted that if power is given
under the Act / statute / Rules to do a certain thing in a
particular way, the thing must be done in that way or not at all.
The other method are forbidden. On this point, learned Counsel
placed reliance upon the case of Taylor Vs. Taylor [(1875) 1
Ch.D 426, 431] , Ramchandra vs. Govind AIR 1975 SC 915
839, Shivcharan Sharma Vs. Union of India and Others 1981
A.L.J. 641 and A.R. Antalay Vs. Ramdas Sriniwas Nayak and
Another 1984 2 SCC 500 wherein Hon’ble Court have held that
failure to comply with the provisions made for doing a particular
act renders the action nonest.
8.     Learned counsel further submitted that vide order dated
31.8.2020, this Court has directed learned A.G.A. to file counter
affidavit, accordingly, counter affidavit has been filed in this
case but there is no categorical averment in the counter
affidavit that sampling was done according to standing order /
instruction. He further submitted that this Court vide order dated
6.9.2021 directed the counsel for applicant to inform the Court
about the status of the trial, accordingly, supplementary affidavit
was filed by applicant on 13.9.2021 annexing the certified copy
of the order sheet in order to demonstrate that trial has not
been concluded and prosecution has not produced any witness
in the Court, therefore, custody of the applicant is against the
provision of Article 21 of the Constitution of India. He further
submitted that trial is still pending.
9.    Learned counsel lastly submitted that applicant has no
other criminal antecedents and is languishing in jail since
10.   On the other hand, learned A.G.A. submitted that search
was made in accordance with law and total 91 packets
weighting 201 K.G. contraband was recovered from which
sample has been taken and sent for chemical examination, in
which, it was found that sample weighting 1 K.G. was Ganja.
He further submitted that investigation was conducted in free
and fair manner, accordingly, charge sheet was submitted
against the applicant under Sections 8, 20, 29, 60, 3 of N.D.P.S.
Act. He further submitted that although it is admitted that
applicant has no criminal history but accused applicant is a man
of criminal nature, as such, is not entitled to be released on bail,
otherwise it will be harmful to the society. On the point of
compliance of Standing Order / instruction no.1 of 1989 and its
averment in any document (F.I.R., recovery memo or in the
counter affidavit before this Court), learned A.G.A. could not
satisfy the Court that compliance of standing order / instruction
was made in respect to sampling of alleged contraband from 91
11.   In reply, learned counsel for the applicant submitted that
the applicant is in custody from more than 2 ½ years and trial is
still pending and there is fair chance of acquittal of the applicant
on the ground mentioned above, so applicant is entitled to be
released on bail. On the point of custody, learned counsel for
the applicant placed reliance upon a case arising out of
N.D.P.S. Act in which point of sampling etc. were involved and
the Apex Court has released the accused on bail in which
accused (Raja Chandrasekharan) remained in custody for over
a period of two years, the reference of the case is as follows:
Bharat Chaudhary Vs. Union of India with Raja
Chandrasekharan       Vs.   the    Intelligence   Officer
reported in 2021 O Supreme (SC) 811.
12.    The Court while considering the provisions of Section 37
of the N.D.P.S. Act finds that State was granted time to reply
and the State has filed counter affidavit, which has been taken
into consideration. So far as other conditions is concerned, it
will be relevant to mention that the Apex Court in the case of
Union of India vs. Shiv Shankar Keshari (2007) 7 SCC 798 as
well as in Union of India Vs. Rattan Malik (2009) 2 SCC 624
has held that court while considering the bail application with
reference to section-37 of the Act is not called upon the record
a finding of not guilty. It is for the limited purpose essentially
confined to the question of releasing the accused on bail that
the Court is called upon to see if there are reasonable grounds
for believing that the accused is not guilty and records its
satisfaction about existence of such grounds. It is further
material to state that the applicant has no criminal history which
is not disputed by the State.
13.    Considering the submissions of both the parties and
keeping in mind the twin conditions of Section 37 of N.D.P.S.
Act and perusing the evidence on the record, it is very much
established that sampling was done contrary to the Standing
Order / Instruction No.1 of 1989 dated 13.6.1989, which are
mandatory in nature, as such chances of applicant conviction is
weak on the basis of sampling of contraband done in the
present matter as well as on the basis of the ratio of the
judgment in the case of Union of India vs. Shiv Shankar Keshri
(supra) larger mandate of Article 21 of the constitution of India
without expressing any opinion on the merit of the case, I am of
the view after applying section 37 of the N.D.P.S. act that the
applicant is entitled to be released on bail.
14.     Let the applicant- Wali Hassan involved in aforesaid case
be released on bail on their furnishing a personal bonds and
two heavy sureties each in the like amount to the satisfaction of
the Court concerned with the following conditions:-
(i) The applicant shall file an undertaking to the effect that he
shall not seek any adjournment on the dates fixed for evidence
when the witnesses are present in court. In case of default of
this condition, it shall be open for the trial court to treat it as
abuse of liberty of bail and pass orders in accordance with law.
(ii) The applicant shall remain present before the trial court on
each date fixed, either personally or through his counsel. In
case of his absence, without sufficient cause, the trial court may
proceed against him under Section 229-A of the Indian Penal
(iii) In case, the applicant misuses the liberty of bail during trial
and in order to secure his presence proclamation under Section
82 Cr.P.C. is issued and the applicant fails to appear before the
court on the date fixed in such proclamation, then, the trial court
shall initiate proceedings against him, in accordance with law,
under Section 174-A of the Indian Penal Code.
(iv) The applicant shall remain present, in person, before the
trial court on the dates fixed for (i) opening of the case, (ii)
framing of charge and (iii) recording of statement under Section
313 Cr.P.C. If in the opinion of the trial court absence of the
applicant is deliberate or without sufficient cause, then it shall
be open for the trial court to treat such default as abuse of
liberty of bail and proceed against him in accordance with law.
