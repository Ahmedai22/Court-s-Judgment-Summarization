Mr. A.H.M. Vakil, Advocate for the Applicants.
Mr. A.R. Kale, APP, for the Respondent – State.
Mr. W.A. Shaikh, Advocate for the Respondent No. 2.
1.               With consent, heard finally at the stage of
2.               By this Application under Section 482 of the
Code of Criminal Procedure, the Applicants have sought
to quash the criminal proceedings bearing R.C.C. No.
50/2021         emanating            from the   first   information            report
bearing C.R. No. 280/2017, dated 07.11.2017 registered
at Phulambri Police Station for the offences punishable
under Sections 498-A, 323, 504, 506 read with 34 of the
3.               The aforesaid crime was registered pursuant to
the first information report lodged by the Respondent
Malani                                                                         Page 1  of 7
No. 2 against her husband and his parents being the
Applicant Nos. 1 to 3 respectively. The marriage of the
Applicant no.1 and the Respondent no. 2 was solemnized
on 31.05.2014. There was rift in the matrimonial ties
between the Respondent No. 2 and the Applicant No.1,
which led to filing of the first information report. In
the FIR, the Respondent No. 2 has alleged that the
Applicants demanded dowry of Rs. 5,00,000/- and that
they subjected her to physical and mental cruelty for
not meeting the unlawful demand. She claims that she
left       her     matrimonial           home   due   to    the     ill-treatment
meted        out      to     her.      Based  on   these     allegations,              the
aforesaid crime came to be registered.
4.               The      crime       was  investigated       and     the      charge-
sheet came to be filed. The charge was framed and the
applicants herein pleaded not guilty and claimed to be
tried.        Upon      considering         the  evidence       adduced         by     the
prosecution,              by      judgement    dated    01.03.2021,            learned
Magistrate            held        the    Applicants     guilty       of      offences
punishable under Sections 498-A, 323 read with Section
34     of     the      Indian        Penal   Code   and    sentenced          them       to
undergo simple imprisonment of 6 month and fine of Rs.
Malani                                                                           Page 2  of 7
2,000/- each, in default to sufffer one month simple
imprisonment for offences punishable under Section 498-
A read with 34 of IPC and to suffer simple imprisonment
of 3 month each and fine of Rs. 500/- each, in default
to suffer fifteen days simple imprisonment for offence
under Section 323 read with 34 IPC. Being aggrieved by
the        said      conviction         and   sentence,      the      Applicants
preferred Criminal Appeal No. 20/2021 before learned
District           and      Sessions      Judge,  Aurangabad,           which         is
pending hearing.
5.               Learned Counsel for the Applicants and learned
Counsel         for     Respondent       No.   2 state     that      during         the
pendency of the Appeal, the parties have settled the
dispute amicably. It is stated that by way of Khula the
Applicant No. 1 and Respondent No. 2 have separated. As
per consent terms, the Respondent No. 2 has been paid
Rs. 3,25,000/- along with Meher amount.
6.               The parties have invoked the jurisdiction of
this Court under Section 482 Cr.P.C post-conviction and
during the pendency of the appeal. It may be mention
that       in    the      case       of Ramawatar Vs. State of Madhya
Pradesh reported in 2021 SCC OnLine SC 966, one of the
Malani                                                                        Page 3  of 7
questions before the Hon’ble Supreme Court was wehther
the jurisdiction of Supreme Court under Article 142 of
the Constitution of India can be invoked for quashing
the       criminal           proceedings       arising    out      of     a      ‘non-
compoundable               offence’.        While   answering           the        said
question, the Hon’ble the Supreme Court has observed
10. So far as the first question is
concerned, it would be ad rem to outrightly
refer to the recent decision of this Court
in the case of Ramgopal & Anr v. The State
of Madhya Pradesh5, wherein, a two Judge
Bench of this Court consisting of two of us
(N.V. Ramana, CJI & Surya Kant, J) was
confronted with an identical question.
Answering in the affirmative, it has been
clarified that the jurisdiction of a Court
under          Section       320    Cr.P.C      cannot          be
construed as a proscription against the
invocation of inherent powers vested in
this Court under Article 142 of the
Constitution nor on the powers of the High
Courts under Section 482 Cr.P.C. It was
further held that the touchstone for
exercising the extra-ordinary powers under
Article 142 or Section 482 Cr.P.C., would
be to do complete justice. Therefore, this
Court or the High Court, as the case may
be, after having given due regard to the
nature of the offence and the fact that the
victim/complainant has willingly entered
into a settlement/compromise, can quash
proceedings in exercise of their respective
constitutional/inherent powers.
11. The Court in Ramgopal (Supra) further
postulated              that     criminal      proceedings
Malani                                                                         Page 4  of 7
involving non-heinous offences or offences
which are predominantly of a private
nature, could be set aside at any stage of
the proceedings, including at the appellate
level. The Court, however, being conscious
of the fact that unscrupulous offenders may
attempt              to     escape     their        criminal
liabilities              by   securing    a      compromise
through brute force, threats, bribes, or
other such unethical and illegal means,
cautioned that in cases where a settlement
is struck post-conviction, the Courts
should, inter-alia, carefully examine the
fashion in which the compromise has been
arrived at, as well as, the conduct of the
accused before and after the incident in
question. While concluding, the Court also
formulated certain guidelines and held:
“19… Nonetheless, we reiterate that
such powers of wide amplitude ought to
be exercised carefully in the context
of        quashing        criminal    proceedings,
bearing in mind: (i) Nature and effect
of the offence on the conscious of the
society;            (ii)   Seriousness       of       the
injury, if any; (iii) Voluntary nature
of compromise between the accused and
the victim; & (iv) Conduct of the
accused persons, prior to and after the
occurrence of the purported offence
and/or other relevant considerations.”
13. We, however, put a further caveat
that the powers under Article 142 or under
Section 482 Cr.P.C., are exercisable in
post-conviction matters only where an
appeal is pending before one or the other
Judicial forum. This is on the premise that
an order of conviction does not attain
finality till the accused has exhausted
his/her legal remedies and the finality is
sub-judice before an appellate court. The
pendency of legal proceedings, be that may
before the final Court, is sine-qua-non to
Malani                                                                         Page 5  of 7
involve the superior court’s plenary powers
to do complete justice. Conversely, where a
settlement has ensued post the attainment
of all legal remedies, the annulment of
proceedings on the basis of a compromise
would be impermissible. Such an embargo is
necessitated to prevent the accused from
gaining an indefinite leverage, for such a
settlement/compromise will always be loaded
with lurking suspicion about its bona fide.
We have already clarified that the purpose
of these extra-ordinary powers is not to
incentivise any hollow-hearted agreements
between the accused and the victim but to
do complete justice by effecting genuine
settlement(s).
7.               From a plain reading of this judgement, it is
clear that powers under Section 482 of Cr.P.C can be
exercised in post conviction matters when an appeal is
pending before one or the other judicial forum. In the
instant case, as noted above, it is stated that the
appeal filed by the Applicants is pending before the
Sessions Court, Aurangabad. Hence, there is no embargo
in    exercising             power    under  Section      482    of     Cr.P.C         to
quash        present         proceedings     at   post    conviction           stage,
particularly considering the fact that the proceedings
are emanating from the matrimonial dispute.
8.               The Respondent          No. 2 is present before the
Court. She confirms that she and the Applicant No. 1
have        separated            by  way  of    Khula.     She     has       further
Malani                                                                         Page 6  of 7
admitted          having          received    Rs.   3,25,000/-         along        with
Meher        from      the       Applicant     No.  1.   She      has     given         no
objection to quash the proceedings. It is stated that
the Applicants have no other criminal antecedents. We
are      satisfied           that     the   settlement     is    voluntary            and
9.               Considering           the   nature    of     accusations             and
particularly that the parties have now decided to put
an end to their strained relationship and move on with
life, we are of the view that this is a fit case to
exercise inherent power of this Court under Section 482
of Cr.P.C. to secure the ends of justice. Under the
circumstances, the Application is allowed in terms of
prayer           clause            ‘B’.    Consequently,         the        criminal
proceedings            bearing        R.C.C.    No.  50/2021       &     the      first
information            report        bearing    C.R.  No.     280/2017,           dated
07.11.2017 registered with Phulambri Police Station for
the offences punishable under Sections 498-A, 323, 504,
506 read with 34 of the Indian Penal Code, are hereby
quashed and set aside qua the present Applicants.
