canceled by the State Government for different reasons and that
time the applicants- teaching staff/non teaching were required
to be declared surplus and as such there being a delay in
undertaking and concluding the exercise for declaring the
teaching staff/non teaching as surplus, the teachers had
discharged their duties, as such under the directions of the
D.E.O, but were not paid with the salary till the D.E.O. passed a
specific order declaring them as surplus. The Tribunal has,
therefore, considered the case of teaching staff /non teaching
(respondents herein) and ordered that the respondents are
entitled to the salaries for the services rendered by them between
February-2005 till 28.10.2005.
2.      It is the case of the State Government that in view of the
fact that the school where the respondents were working as
Teachers was derecognized on account of irregularities and
illegalities, as the school had claimed to be falsely recognized as
a minority institution and in fact, the State Government has
ordered recovery from the school management to the tune of
Rs.22 crore and more.
2.1     It is submitted that this order of the State Government for
recovery of the amount from the school management was
challenged at various stages even till High Court, but such order
was sustained, and therefore, the action of the State Government
for canceling the registration of the school managed by the Trust
was justified. This being so obviously, the Teachers and staffs,
who were working under the Trust which claimed to be the
minority institute, cannot claim the benefit, as their appointment
itself was in question.
2.2. It is submitted that the Tribunal has not taken into
consideration the fact that the application was made for
declaring the respondents, as surplus, which was for the good
reason turned down, and therefore, by a reasoned order, the
D.E.O, at the relevant time, has not accepted the proposal for
declaring the respondents, as surplus Teachers, and therefore,
there is no question of the government taking the responsibility
of the respondent-teachers. Moreover, it is submitted that while
rejecting the proposal from the respondents, it was categorically
held that the financial responsibility of the staff would that be of
the school management. Lastly, it is submitted that it is ironical
that at one hand on account of the irregularities and illegalities
by the school management, the State Government has to recover
the huge amount of 22 crore and more and on the other hand,
the State Government has to pay to the staff of such school.
3.     As against this, learned advocate appearing for the
respondents submitted that the initial order passed by the D.E.O
refusing to declare the respondents as surplus was based only
on the ground that the proposal was required to be moved by the
school management and that the D.E.O, therefore, did not
consider the proposal, which was forwarded by the school
teachers themselves.
3.1    It is submitted that except for this, there was no other
ground for rejecting the proposal for declaring the respondents,
as surplus, and therefore, by applying the proper regulation,
governing the principles of declaring surplus, the Tribunal has
rightly considered the case of the Teachers, as admittedly, by the
action of the government itself, the recognization of the school
management was canceled, and therefore, expecting the school
management to move the proposal for declaring the school
teachers as surplus was a condition impossible to be fulfilled at
least by the staff, and therefore, the proposal moved by the
Teachers themselves was required to be accepted.
3.2    It is submitted that such proposal was thereafter accepted
pursuant to the directions given by this Court in an application
filed by the respondents in Civil Application for Joining Party in
the main matter filed by the management against canceling of
4.     Having        considered the    rival  submissions     of      learned
advocates for the parties and having perused the documents on
record and from the facts on record, it appears that the school
Shala run by a public trust viz. Janta Education Trust
Sanchalit, had faced an action by the State Government, as
according to the State Government, the school management had
falsely claimed to be a minority school and enjoyed the benefits
of Grant-in-Aid available to a minority school.
4.1    It appears that the issue with regards to the fact that
whether the school is minority school or not was carried at
various level and ultimately, the State Government passed an
order to the effect that the school was not entitled to enjoy the
status of minority school and that benefit has been taken by the
school management is required to be paid back to the
government and accordingly, the order was passed, directing the
school management to refund the amount to the tune of Rs.22
crore and more. This order was also a subject matter of
challenge before this Court , ultimately the order of the State
Government had prevailed. During these proceedings against the
school management, as the school was derecognized, the issue of
the salary of the school teachers also would be of relevant
consideration, and therefore, apparently the school teachers
raised this issue before the District Education Officer (D.E.O.) for
declaring them as surplus teachers. Initially, the D.E.O. did not
accept the application of the school teachers and rejected such
application, however, in the pending petition before this Court
being Special Civil Application No.191 of 2005 filed by the school
management against the order of the State Government, the
Teachers filed Civil Application No. 9668 of 2005 and by order
dated 28.10.2005, this Court directed the State Government to
pass appropriate orders in the matter, as regards the staff being
declared as surplus latest by 29.10.2005. The order dated
29.10.2005 came to be passed by the D.E.O., whereby 33
employees        of  the school  were       declared   as    surplus           and
accordingly, they were absorbed in different schools and salaries
were being paid with effect from the date on which they were
declared declared surplus, however, with regard to the period
between the date on which recognizance of the school stood
canceled i.e. 08.12.2004 till the date on which the D.E.O.
declared the respondents-teachers as surplus for that period.
According to the respondents, as they had continued to
discharge their duties in the benefit of the school children for
remaining part of the academic year, they were entitled to the
salaries. The Tribunal by taking into consideration Regulation
10(A) (g) of the Gujarat Secondary Education Regulation, 1974
and the provision therein for the purpose of declaring the school
teacher as surplus arrived at a conclusion that the respondent-
school teachers had rightly raised their claim for declaring them
as surplus and that too within a reasonable time. Thereafter,
considering a reasonable time within which such decision could
have been taken by the D.E.O., but was not taken as such, and
therefore though respondents had discharged their duties, but
still did not receive any salary. Therefore, in the opinion of this
Court, the Tribunal has given justifiable reasons for recognizing
the services rendered by the respondents-teachers during the
period between de-recognizing of the school till absorption of the
respondents and granted 75% of their salaries.
4.2     It   is    reported  that  subsequent        to   the    order        dated
29.10.2005, now, the respondents have been regularly absorbed
in various schools and some of them have also attained the age
of superannuation.
4.3     It is the policy of the State Government, as contained in
several resolutions, the last in line being G.R. dated 06.07.1998
that whenever the employees of private secondary school are
required to be retrenched either due to the closure of classes or
due to the closure of school, if they fulfill the criteria prescribed
in the G.R.s then they              are not required to face actual
termination, but by declaring them surplus Government of
Gujarat extends protection to their services and they are
absorbed in any other aided registered private secondary school.
There are two situations in which an employee can be declared
surplus. The employee may be required to be declared surplus
due to reduction of class or classes. Another situation is that the
employees         are   required  to    be     declared    surplus        due        to
deregistration of the school. In the first situation, the school
continues, but some classes are reduced. For reduction of
classes by continuing the school u/s.10-A of the Gujarat
Secondary Education Regulations, 1974 the school management
is required to send a proposal in writing to the D.E.O. and on
that proposal the D.E.O. passes the order about reduction of
classes so also declaring the affected employees surplus. In the
situation like this where the Gujarat Secondary Education Board
has canceled the registration of the school, the existence of the
school itself does not remain. In such situation, in my view, Reg.
10-A would not come into play. The management is is not
required to send any proposal because the entire school is closed
due to deregistration. The D.E.O. is immediately after the
Boardâ€™s order required to take steps and pass order declaring the
eligible employees surplus. Moreover, it is the settled practice of
the Department that in such cases where the registration of the
school is canceled by the board the process of declaring the
employees surplus is undertaken by the D.E.O. on his own and
no proposal by the management is necessary. In this view of the
matter, the submission of the D.E.O. that there was no proposal
from the management for declaring the employees surplus and
therefore, they were not declared surplus is not tenable. The
submission of the D.E.O. about pendency of the appeal by the
management before the department and in the High Court, in
my view, cannot be considered as a cogent ground for not taking
steps to declare the employees surplus. From the facts noticed
above, it can be seen that from October 2004, the salaries of the
employees        were withheld   and       they have    made         several
representations for releasing their salaries, but despite such
requests the D.E.O. has not taken any steps to release their
salaries or to declare them surplus. If the D.E.O. had passed
timely order declaring them surplus then they would have been
absorbed elsewhere immediately and the question of non-
payment of salaries for such a long time would not have arisen.
Instead of passing the order on 29.10.05, if the D.E.O. had on
his own as per the government guidelines and policy passed the
order within reasonable time after 08.12.04, then this hardship
to the teachers and non-teaching staff could have been averted.
5.       In the opinion of the Court, no ground is made out to
assail a just and proper decision of the tribunal and the decision
of the Gujarat Secondary Education Tribunal, Ahmedabad is not
required to be interfered with. Hence, the present petition
deserves to be dismissed and is hereby dismissed.
