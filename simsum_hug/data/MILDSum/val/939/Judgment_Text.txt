along with interest from the date of receipt
till the date of repayment”.
2.   Sri. H.Shanthi Bhushan, learned Additional
Solicitor General appearing for the petitioners fairly
submits that he would not press the relief No.(i). Hence,
the   same    is   does   not   survive    for   consideration.
Therefore,    the   present   petition    is   taken     up  for
consideration of relief Nos. (ii) and (iii).
3.   It is the case of the petitioners that it owns
buildings in Mangalore City which has been used for
residential quarters for its employees and the said
building   is    situated   within    the      jurisdiction   of
respondent     No.2-Corporation.    That     respondent     No.3
had demanded property tax in respect of the building
used for residential purposes by the petitioner No.3.
That the petitioner No.3 in advertently with bonafide
intention made the payment in an aggregate sum of
Rs.4,42,675/- to the respondent No.2-Corporation in
compliance with the demand notices issued during the
year 1994-95 to 31.03.2008 as per the following
“(a)  A sum of Rs.4,11,317/- vide DD No.280420
dated 28.03.2007,
(b)   A sum of Rs.15,679/- vide DD No.288751
dated 31.10.2007 and
(c)   A sum of Rs.15,679/- vide DD No.172171
dated 02.04.2008”.
4.    It is the further contention of the petitioners
that it was subsequently noticed that demand made by
the respondent No.-2 corporation with regard to payment
of property tax was illegal and contrary to the provisions
of Article 285 (1) of the Constitution of India. Therefore,
a representation dated 25.02.2010 as per Annexure-A
was made to the respondent No.2 seeking exemption of
the building from the payment of property tax and also
sought for refund of the amount already paid by it. Since,
no action was taken, the petitioner No.3 made another
representation     on   25.05.2010 as    per  Annexure-B
reiterating   its   earlier    requisition.       However,    on
04.06.2010,      respondent       No.3    relying     upon   the
provision    of   Section    110(1)(j)     of   the    Karnataka
Municipal Corporation Act, 1976 (hereafter referred to
as the KMC Act) rejected the claim of the petitioner
No.3    and demanded for payment of property tax for
the year 2009-10 as per Annexure-C. In response
thereof, petitioner No.3 after obtaining opinion from
its Law    Department made yet another representation
on 28.09.2010 as per Annexure-D seeking exemption
from    payment     of   property   tax   as   provided    under
Article  285    (1)   of   the   Constitution    of  India.  The
respondent        No.4        without       considering      the
representations given earlier, issued another demand
notice    dated    16.07.2011      demanding        payment   of
arrears of property tax in respect of the building
belonging to the petitioners on the premise of the
provisions of the Section 110(j) of the KMC Act, 1976.
Being aggrieved by the aforesaid demand, petitioners
are before this Court.
5.    This     Court    considering    the   fact    and
situation   of   the   matter    had  directed   the   learned
Additional     Solicitor   General     appearing     for   the
petitioners    and   learned   counsel   appearing    for  the
respondent Nos.2 to 4 to furnish the details with
regard   to   the   date   of  construction   of  building   in
question.     Learned counsel for the respondent No.3
has submitted copy of the building licence concerning
the property in the nature of demand register extract.
It is seen that the building licence has been issued by
the respondent No.2 on 26.04.1991 and building has
been completed and occupancy certificate has been
issued on 10.06.1994. The aforesaid information was
required in view of the Article 285 of the Constitution
of India which provides as under;
"285. Exemption of property of the
Union from state taxation.-          (1)    The
property of the Union shall, save in so far as
Parliament may by law otherwise provide,
be exempt from all taxes imposed by a
State or by any       authority within a State.
(2) Nothing in clause (1) shall , until
Parliament     by law otherwise provides,
prevent any authority      within     a   State
from levying any tax on any property of the
Union to which such property was
immediately before the commencement of
this Constitution liable   or     treated    as
liable, so long as that tax continues to be
levied in that State".
6.    Thus, it is clear from reading of the clause
(1)   of  Article   285    of   the   Constitution    extracted
hereinabove that if a building belonging to Union of
India was in existence prior to coming into effect of
the Constitution and said building unless Parliament
may by law otherwise be exempt from levy of tax by
the State or any other authorities. Clause (2) of the
Article 285 of the Constitution on the other hand
makes it clear that if a building was in existence prior
to   commencement          of   the  Constitution   and   till
Parliament by law otherwise provides the same shall
not levy tax thereon. In the instant case as noted
above,    the     building   in  question  has    come  into
existence      in    the    year    1994    subsequent     to
commencement of Constitution.
7.     Learned ASG also relies upon the judgment
of this Court in the case of Union of India and
others vs. City Municipal Council, Rani Bennur
and another reported in AIR 2000 Karnataka 104,
wherein dealing with identical situation, this Court at
paragraph 7 as held as under;
“7. Provisions of Article 289 exempt the
property of the State and that of Article 285,
provide exemption to property of the Union
are complementary to each other with a view
not to levy the tax by State Legislature on
the property of the Union and also by the
Parliament on the property of the State.
Article 285 refers to the property of the
Union. If the property belongs to the Union,
then, irrespective of its use, no tax could be
levied by the State Legislature or by
Municipal Authorities. The concept of use is
not provided under Article 285. The denial of
exemption under the proviso to Section 94 of
the Act on the ground that the property is
used or intended to be used for residential or
commercial purpose cannot be considered to
be inconsonance with the spirit of Article 285
of the Constitution of India. Any property
belonging to the Union of India irrespective of
its use could not be subjected to tax and
therefore the proviso of Section 94 of the
Karnataka Municipalities Act to that extent is
ultra vires of Article 285 of the Constitution of
8.    Learned counsel for the respondent Nos. 2
to 4 does not dispute the aforesaid legal position. In
that   view   of  the   matter,   petition  deserves    to  be
allowed     quashing     the    demand     notices   as    per
Annexures-C and F. As regards the prayer for refund
of Rs.4,42,675/- is concerned which          was apparently
paid    by   the  petitioners    under   bonafied   intention,
learned counsel for the       respondents submits that the
petitioners though not liable for property tax, are
liable to pay service tax for the amenities provided
and that the amount so paid would be adjusted/set off
against the said claim. Learned ASG has no objection
for   the  same.  The   respondent  –authorities  shall
intimate about the service tax which the petitioners
are liable to pay and the amount already paid by the
petitioners as noted above shall be adjusted against
the said demand.
With the aforesaid observations, the petition is
disposed of.
