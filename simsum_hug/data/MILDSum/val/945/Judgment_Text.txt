1.     This is an application filed on behalf of the petitioner under Section
439 read with Section 482 Cr.P.C. for grant of regular bail to the petitioner
in FIR No.147/2021, under Sections 392/397/411/34 I.P.C. and Sections
25/27 of Arms Act registered at Police Station: Khajuri Khas.
2.     In brief, as per the case of the prosecution, on 14.04.2021at about
10:21AM a PCR call, vide DD No.44A was received regarding robbery at
gunpoint. During investigation, complainant Sudhir Kumar informed that
while he was present in the office at about 10 AM, 3 boys entered into the
office and robbed an amount of Rs.9,98,170/- from Mannapuram Finance
Ltd. with the help of gun and knife and thereafter fled from the spot.
3.     It is submitted by learned APP for the State that during the course of
investigation, three accused were arrested on 14.04.2021 with the help of
CCTV footage, namely Sajid Khan @ Bittu (petitioner), Ajmerul Alam @
Dabbu and Md.Janu.
Further, at the instance of Sajid Khan (petitioner), amount of Rs.5
lakh was recovered along with a toy gun. An amount of Rs.2.5 lakh, a bag, a
paper cutter, a country made pistol along with two live cartridges were
recovered at the instance of Md.Janu. Also, clothes worn by Md.Janu and
Sajid Khan at the time of incident were recovered.                 Amount of
Rs.2,46,210/- along with a country made pistol was further recovered from
the possession of Ajmerul Alam.
4.     Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that accused Ajmerul Alam
@ Dabbu and Md.Janu were granted bail by Ld.ASJ on 25.05.2021 and
19.06.2021 respectively and claims bail on parity.
5.     Learned APP for the State vehemently opposes the bail application on
the ground that role of the petitioner Sajid Khan is distinct from the other
accused persons since the petitioner was the mastermind as he had an
account with Mannapuram Finance Ltd. and had also refused to join the TIP
proceedings. Further, a major portion of the recovery is stated to have been
recovered at the instance of the petitioner. Learned APP further submits that
no grounds for parity are made out since accused Ajmerul Alam @ Dabbu
was released vide order 25.05.2021 in view of COVID-19 pandemic and
being first time offender. It is also pointed out that the application filed on
behalf of the petitioner has been earlier rejected and was lastly dismissed as
withdrawn before this Court vide order dated 12.08.2021.
6.     I have given considered thought to the contentions raised.
It may be observed that co-accused Md.Janu had been released on bail
vide order dated 19.06.2021 on the grounds of parity without considering the
factual details in order dated 25.05.2021 whereby accused Ajmerul Alam
was granted bail. The material irregularities in order dated 25.05.2021
passed by Shri Devender Kumar, Vacation Judge/ASJ-02, NE/KKD/Delhi
are apt to be noticed and the order may be beneficially reproduced :-
Present.       Shri R.K. Satyarthi, Ld. Addl. PP for State with IO.
Mr. Narender Kumar, Ld. Counsel for applicant.
Arguments heard.
This application has been filed by accused
Azmerul Alam for regular bail.
Accused is lying in JC since 14.04.2021 and is not
required for any investigation purpose. Accused is not
covered under HPC guidelines. Accused stated to be
first time offender and is not involved in any other case
as verified by IO. In view of covid situation and factum
of being first time offender, accused Azmerul Alam is
admitted on bail, on furnishing of personal bond of
Rs.25,000/- and one surety of like amount, to the
satisfaction of Ld. Duty MM/Jail Superintendent.
Accused shall not try to influence witnesses and
shall surrender in time after the period of interim bail.
Accused shall not indulge in any other case. Accused
shall not leave Delhi without permission of the court
concerned. Accused shall share his mobile number and
location with SHO so that he may be contacted in any
exigency.
Copy of order be sent to counsel for applicant
through email, if email is provided.‚Äù
7.    On the face of record, it is doubtful whether the Ld. ASJ vide order
dated 25.05.2021 intended to release the accused Ajmerul Alam @ Dabbu
on regular bail or interim bail. Further, vide passing order dated 19.06.2021
while granting bail to co-accused Md. Janu, the factual discrepancy in order
dated 25.05.2021 was not noticed. It was not even considered that the
benefit was extended to co-accused Ajmerul Alam due to covid conditions.
8.     In deciding the case of parity, the role attributed to the accused, their
position in relation to the incident and to the victim is of utmost importance.
I am of the considered opinion that since a day-light robbery had been
committed at Mannapuram Finance Ltd. and a substantial amount had been
recovered at the instance of petitioner, who was the mastermind, it is not a
fit case for grant of bail.
Application is accordingly dismissed.
A copy of this order be forwarded to the learned trial court,
Shri Devender Kumar, ASJ-02, NE, KKD, Delhi and Shri Sunil Chaudhary,
Special Judge (NDPS)/ASJ, NE, Delhi for information and with the caution
to avoid such glaring discrepancies as observed in order dated 25.05.2021
as it has a chain effect in consideration of subsequent bail applications of
co-accused.
