that the point raised in this writ petition is squarely covered by a
Full Bench decision of this Court in Kerala Pattikajathi
Samrakshana Samithi and Another v. State of Kerala and
others [1995 KHC 537]. In that decision, the Full Bench of
this Court observed that the adoption, marriage and conversion
of faith of individual from one caste to another as permitted by
the Law of Adoption or marriage have no relevance for the
purpose of claiming the benefit of reservation under Art.16(4)
W.P.(C). No. 21328 of 2021
of the Constitution of India. The Apex Court also considered
this point in Sunita Singh v. State of Uttar Pradesh [AIR
In the light of the above decision from the Full Bench of
this Court and from the Apex Court, Ext.P6 will not stand.
Therefore, by making the interim order dated 06.10.2021
absolute, this writ petition is allowed. Ext.P6 is quashed. The
4th respondent is directed to issue the caste certificate to the
petitioner showing that the petitioner belongs to Christian Latin
Catholic, as expeditiously as possible, at any rate, within two
