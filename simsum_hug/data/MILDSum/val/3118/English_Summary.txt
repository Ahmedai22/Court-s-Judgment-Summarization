The Rajasthan High Court (Jodhpur Bench) has directed the state police to not investigate allegations leveled against News 18 Journalist Aman Chopra of committing offence punishable under Section 124-A of the Indian Penal Code (sedition)
This relief for Chopra has come in an FIR registered against him for airing a discussion show named as "Desh Jhukne Nahi Denge" and subsequently posting it on his Twitter account, which allegedly resulted in communal disharmony and communal riots on 22.04.2022 at Alwar. Importantly, the Bench of Justice Dinesh Mehta has issued this direction in the light of today's order of the Supreme Court wherein 152-year-old sedition law [under Section 124A of the Indian Penal Code] has been kept in abeyance till the Union Government reconsiders the provision. Chopra's Counsels informed the bench about the Supreme Court's order. For the act of airing and posting his show on Twitter, three FIRs were registered. First FIR was registered with Police Station Bichwada Dungarpur vide FIR No. 147/2022 (the instant matter) on 23.04.2022 and second FIR was registered with Police Station Sadar, Bundi vide FIR No. 200/2022 on 23.04.2022 itself and the third FIR was instituted with Police Station Kotwali, Alwar vide FIR No. 372/2022 on 24.04.2022. He has been booked under Sections 124-A (sedition), 295-A (acts intended to outrage religious feelings), and 153-A (promoting enmity between different groups) of the Indian Penal Code. In the subsequent two FIRs [FIR No. 200/2022 and FIR No. 372/2022], he was granted relief on May 7, as the Court ordered an order granting interim protection from arrest. Now, regarding the very first FIR, for which the instant plea had been filed, the Court observed that investigation, including the petitioner's interrogation, is necessary before reaching any concrete conclusion regarding the commission of offences alleged against the petitioner. The petitioner was, therefore, directed to appear before the Investigating Officer, Police Station Bichhiwada, District Dungarpur on 16.05.2022 at 11.00 a.m. The Investigating Officer has been directed to carry out the investigation/interrogation by 5.00 p.m., whereafter, the Court added, the State would be free to pray for the further opportunity for investigation (if required) on the next date of hearing [May 20, 2022]. Till then, the Court has directed that Chopra shall not be arrested in relation to instant FIR or in relation to any other FIR filed or likely to be filed concerning the program 'Desh Nahi Jhukne Denge' aired at 8.00 p.m. on 22.04.2022.
