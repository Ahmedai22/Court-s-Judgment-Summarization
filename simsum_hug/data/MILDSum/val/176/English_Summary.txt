The Gujarat High Court has granted temporary bail of three days to Rafik Adam Sumra, accused in the infamous heroin smuggling case of 2018, for attending the marriage ceremony of his daughter.
 A Bench comprising Justice Vipul Pancholi and Justice Sandeep Bhatt ordered that Rafik shall be released on temporary bail during the period from July 16 to July 18, 2022, with police escort, on executing personal bond of Rs. 5,000/- before the Jail authority. The cost of police escort shall be borne by him.
Rafik, alongwith one Aziz Abdul Bhagad, was arrested by the Gujarat Anti-Terrorism Squad in August 2018 and about 5 kg heroin worth Rs 14.84 crore was allegedly seized from the duo. It is believed that he is involved in smuggling the contraband into the state from Pakistan through the sea route.
Accordingly, he has been booked for offences punishable under Sections 8(c), 21(c), 24, 25, 27(A) and 29 of the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act (NDPS Act) and Sections 17 and 18 of the Unlawful Activities Act.
The Bench was hearing an appeal under Section 21(1) of the National Investigation Agency Act, 2008 preferred by Rafik, stating that his daughter's Nikaah was fixed for 17th July and his presence is required.
 It may be noted that his daughter had earlier approached the Court at the time of her engagement, challenging a trial court order which denied him temporary bail. Then, the High Court had disposed of her appeal granting liberty to approach it when the date of Nikaah is fixed. In pursuance of same, the instant appeal was filed. The copy of the invitation card was adduced as evidence to seek bail  for 7 days.
 Per contra, the APP opposed the appeal on the ground that serious allegations were levelled against the Appellant in the complaint. While the State verified the genuineness of the invitation card, it contested that the Appellant should be released on temporary bail with police escort at the cost of the Appellant.
 Accordingly, the Court granted temporary bail in the above mentioned terms. Rafik has been directed to surrender before the Jail Authority on completion of temporary bail.
