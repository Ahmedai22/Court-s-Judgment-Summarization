1.       This petition under Section 11 of the Arbitration and
Conciliation Act, 1996 [“the Act”] seeks to invoke jurisdiction of the
Court for appointment of an arbitrator in light of the disputes which
have arisen. The dispute itself relates to elections which were held in
respect of a Multi-State Cooperative Society and would be governed
by Sections 84 and 85 of the Multi-State Cooperative Societies Act,
2.       Section 84 which contemplates reference of disputes between
parties to be resolved by way of arbitration is extracted hereinbelow:-
Settlement of Disputes
(1) Notwithstanding anything contained in any other law for the
time being in force, if any dispute [other than a dispute regarding
disciplinary action taken by a multi-state cooperative society against its
paid employee or an industrial dispute as defined in clause (k) of
section 2 of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 (14 of 1947)] touching
the constitution, management or business of a multi-state cooperative
(a) among members, past members and persons claiming through
members, past members and deceased members, or
(b) between a member, past members and persons claiming
through a member, past member or deceased member and the
multi-state cooperative society, its board or any officer, agent
or employee of the multi-state cooperative society or
liquidator, past or present, or
(c) between the multi-state cooperative society or its board and
any past board, any officer, agent or employee, or any past
officer, past agent or past employee, heirs or legal
representatives of any deceased officer, deceased agent or
deceased employee of the multi-state cooperative society, or
(d) between the multi-state cooperative society and any other
multistate cooperative society, between a multi-state
cooperative society and liquidator of another multi-state
cooperative society or between the liquidator of one multi-
state cooperative society and the liquidator of another multi-
state cooperative society,
such dispute shall be referred to arbitration.
(2) For the purposes of sub-section (1), the following shall be
deemed to be disputes touching the constitution, management or
business of a multi-state cooperative society, namely:-
(a) a claim by the multi-state cooperative society for any debt or
demand due to it from a member or the nominee, heirs or legal
representatives of a deceased member, whether such debt or
demand be admitted or not;
(b) a claim by a surety against the principal debtor where the
cooperative society has recovered from the surety any amount in
respect of any debt or demand due to it from the principal debtor
as a result of the default of the principal debtor, whether such
debt or demand is admitted or not;
(c) any dispute arising in connection with the election of any
officer of a multi-state cooperative society.
(3) If any question arises whether a dispute referred to arbitration
under this section is or is not a dispute touching the constitution,
management or business of a multi-state cooperative society, the
decision thereon of the arbitrator shall be final and shall not be called
in question in any court.
(4) Where a dispute has been referred to arbitration under sub-
section (1), the same shall be settled or decided by the arbitrator to be
appointed by the Central Registrar.
(5) Save as otherwise provided under this Act, the provisions of the
Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (26 of 1996) shall apply to all
arbitration under this Act as if the proceedings for arbitration were
referred for settlement or decision under the provisions of the
Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996”
3.     In terms of Section 84(3), if any, question arises in relation to a
dispute and whether the same is liable to be referred to arbitration, the
provision mandates that the decision of the arbitrator in that respect
shall be final. The power of constitution of the Arbitral Tribunal
arbitration by addressing a notice dated 06 January 2021 to the Central
Registrar. However, the said authority failed to act in terms of the
appointment procedure as contemplated.
4.     Pursuant to notices having been issued on this petition, the
Central Registrar has filed a short affidavit and refers to a notification
dated 24 February 2003 to contend that the petitioner should have
approached the Registrar of Co-operative Societies of the State in
terms of the powers conferred under Section 84 having been
delegated. The notification of 24 February 2003 reads as under:-
(Department of Agriculture and Co-operation)
New Delhi, the 24th February, 2003
S.O.216(E).— In exercise of the powers conferred by Sub-section
(2) of Section 4 of the Multi-State Co-operative Societies Act,
2002 (39 of 2002), the Central Government hereby directs that the
powers exercisable by the Central Registrar under Section 84 of the
Act shall also be exercisable by Registrar of Co-operative Societies
of the States/UTs in respect of the societies located in their
respective jurisdiction, subject to the following guidelines and
conditions, that-
1.   Such powers in relation to a National Co-operative
Society shall not be exercisable by these officers.
2.   The officers shall comply with the directions (other than
court cases) as may be given by the Central Registrar,
appointed under Sub-section (1) of Section 4 of this Act,
from time to time.
3.   Appointment of arbitrators by the State Registrar of co-
operative societies shall be subject to following guide-
(a) In case of disputes relating to organizational and
legal matters, arbitrators should either be a
practicing Advocate or retired member of
Judicial/Civil services or officers at least of the level
of Deputy Registrar and above of co-operative
department retired not more than two years prior to
the date of appointment.
(b) In case of disputes relating to financial and banking
matters including recovery disputes, persons having
financial and accounting background like Chartered
Accountants/ICWAs/retired bank officers (retired
for appointment in addition to the persons listed in
clause 3(a).
4.  The list of approved arbitrators shall be submitted to the
Central Registrar within 15 days of approval. The
updated list of all the approved arbitrators should be sent
to the Central Registrar on quarterly basis.
5.      However, and as would be manifest from a reading of the
contents of that notification, all that the Union Government has
provided is that the powers which are exercisable by the Central
Registrar under Section 84 of the 2002 Act could also be exercised by
the Registrar of Co-operative Societies of the States. Viewed in that
light, it is evident that the Central Registrar did not stand divested of
authority to initiate the appointment process nor does it stand denuded
of jurisdiction to act in terms of Section 84. All that the notification
purports to achieve is to contemporaneously empower the Registrar of
Co-operative Societies of States to refer matters to arbitration. The
Court thus finds itself unable to hold that the initiation of proceedings
for constitution of an Arbitral Tribunal suffered from a manifest
illegality.
6.      Ms. Parvez, learned counsel who has appeared for the
respondent has additionally raised the issue of the claim not being
liable to be referred in light of the provisions contained in Section 85
of the 2002 Act. Section 85 prescribes the limitation in case of
disputes which are to be referred to arbitration. Learned counsel has
specifically referred to clause (1) (c) thereof which provides that when
the dispute is in respect of an election of an officer of a multi-state co-
operative society, the same would have to be raised within one month
from the date of the declaration of the result of the election.
7.      That is an issue which can clearly be decided by the arbitrator
and thus the Court refrains from entering any definitive findings in
8.     Accordingly and for all the aforesaid reasons, the instant
petition is allowed. The aforesaid dispute, raised by the petitioner, is
referred to the Delhi International Arbitration Centre, who would
proceed to appoint a suitable Arbitrator to arbitrate on the
dispute/disputes.
9.     The parties are directed to appear before the learned arbitrator,
as and when notified. This is subject to the learned arbitrator making
the necessary disclosure under Section 12(1) of the Act and not being
ineligible under Section 12(5) of the Act.
10.    The Arbitrator would arbitrate on the dispute in accordance
with the rules and regulations of the Delhi International Arbitration
Centre and the fees of the learned Arbitrator would also be fixed
according to the Schedule of Fees of the Delhi International
11.    In light of the Court having referred the disputes to arbitration,
learned counsel does not press O.M.P.(I) (COMM.) 381/2021, subject
to rights being reserved to approach the Arbitral Tribunal in terms of
Section 17 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996.
