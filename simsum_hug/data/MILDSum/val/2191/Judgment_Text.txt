the National Company Law Tribunal, New Delhi by which an application bearing
CA/725/2019 filed in (IB)-420(ND)/2017 filed by the Appellant (Liquidator)
seeking the following reliefs which are reproduced hereunder :-
“1. To allow the applicant to reduce the claim of the Canara

Fourteen Lakhs Two Hundred Twenty only) along with
relevant interest applied from the date of transaction till
Liquidation commencement date i.e. 13.09.2018.
2. To allow the Applicant to modify the entry in list of
stakeholders in accordance with Regulation 31(3) of the
has been rejected, inter-alia on the ground that the Regulation 31(3) of the IBBI
(Liquidation Process) Regulations, 2016 for short the Regulation is not
applicable, Liquidator is empowered under IBC to accept the claim and the
prayer made by the liquidator is not thus acceptable.
2.    Counsel for the Appellant has submitted that on receiving the additional
information the Liquidator, proceeded in terms of the Regulation 31 of the
Regulations. Regulation 31 of the Regulations is reproduced as under :
31. List of stakeholders.
(1) The liquidator shall prepare a list of stakeholders,
category-wise, on the basis of proofs of claims submitted
and accepted under these Regulations, with-
(a) the amounts of claim admitted, if applicable,

unsecured, if applicable,
(d) the proofs admitted or rejected in part, and the proofs
wholly rejected.
[(2) The liquidator shall file the list of stakeholders with the

Adjudicating Authority, when he comes across additional
information warranting such modification, and shall modify
the entry in the manner directed by the Adjudicating
(4) The liquidator shall modify an entry in the list of

[(d) filed on the electronic platform of the Board for

Provided that this clause shall apply to every liquidation
process ongoing and commencing on or after the date of

3.    It is submitted that he had received a claim from the Canara bank of an
amount of Rs. 55,90,10,316/- which was admitted. However, after receiving
certain information during the process of transaction audit that the total claim
of the Canara Bank is of Rs. 12,14,00,229/- an application was accordingly
moved to the Adjudicating Authority in terms of Regulation 31(3) for the aforesaid
two prayers which have been rejected.
4.     Counsel for the Appellant has submitted that the Tribunal has committed
an error in dismissing the application solely on the ground that the Regulation
31(3) is not applicable. He has submitted that Regulation 31(3) provides that
the Liquidator may apply to the Authority to modify an entry in the list of
stakeholders (in the present case is the Canara Bank) if he comes across
additional information which may warrant modification and shall modify the
entry only on the direction of the Adjudicating Authority. It is further submitted
that there is no other provision either in the Code or in the Regulations. In such
a situation, therefore, Regulation 31(3) is applicable and the order passed by the
Adjudicating Authority is patently illegal.
5.     On the other hand, Counsel appearing on behalf of the Respondent has
referred to Section 39 of the Code to contends that the Liquidator is to verify the
claim submitted under Section 38 as per the time prescribed by the Board and
as per Section 39(2) may also require evidence which he thinks necessary for the
purpose of verifying the whole or relevant part of such claim.           He further
submitted that as per Section 40 of the I & B Code, 2016 the Liquidator may
then after verification of the claim under Section 39 admit or reject it in whole or
in part as the case may be and in case, any party is not satisfied with the decision
of Liquidator about accepting or rejecting the claim may prefer an appeal under
Section 42. Section 38,39,40,41 & 42 are reproduced for a quick reference.
“38. Consolidation of claims. –
(1) The liquidator shall receive or collect the claims of
creditors within a period of thirty days from the date of the
commencement of the liquidation process.
(2) A financial creditor may submit a claim to the liquidator
by providing a record of such claim with an information
utility: Provided that where the information relating to the
claim is not recorded in the information utility, the financial
creditor may submit the claim in the same manner provided
for the submission of claims for the operational creditor
under sub-section (3).
(3) An operational creditor may submit a claim to the
liquidator in such form and in such manner and along with
such supporting documents required to prove the claim as
may be specified by the Board.
(4) A creditor who is partly a financial creditor and partly an
operational creditor shall submit claims to the liquidator to
the extent of his financial debt in the manner as provided in
sub-section (2) and to the extent of his operational debt
under sub-section (3).
(5) A creditor may withdraw or vary his claim under this
section within fourteen days of its submission.
39.Verification of claims.
(1) The liquidator shall verify the claims submitted under
section 38 within such time as specified by the Board.
(2) The liquidator may require any creditor or the corporate
debtor or any other person to produce any other document
Company Appeal (AT) (Ins.) No. 1051 of 2021
or evidence which he thinks necessary for the purpose of
verifying the whole or any part of the claim.
40. Admission or rejection of claims. –
(1) The liquidator may, after verification of claims under
section 39, either admit or reject the claim, in whole or in
part, as the case may be: Provided that where the liquidator
rejects a claim, he shall record in writing the reasons for
such rejection.
(2) The liquidator shall communicate his decision of
admission or rejection of claims to the creditor and corporate
debtor within seven days of such admission or rejection of
claims.
41. Determination of valuation of claims. –
The liquidator shall determine the value of claims admitted
under section 40 in such manner as may be specified by the
42. Appeal against the decision of liquidator. –
A creditor may appeal to the Adjudicating Authority against
the decision of the liquidator [accepting or] rejecting the
claims within fourteen days of the receipt of such decision.”
6.    In rebuttal, Counsel for the Appellant has submitted that in the normal
circumstances the procedure which has been provided in the Code starting from
Section 38 to Section 42 has to be followed but Regulation 31(3) is a special
provision which comes into operation if any information escapes the notice of the
Company Appeal (AT) (Ins.) No. 1051 of 2021
Liquidator or comes to his knowledge after accepting the claim then he can apply
to the Adjudicating Authority for its direction as to what has to be done in such
situation for the purpose of modification of entry in the list of stakeholder.
7.     We have heard Counsel for the parties and after perusal of the record are
of the considered opinion that there is no quarrel with the scheme provided
under Section 38 to 42 of the Code about consolidation of claims, verification,
rejection of claims and the appeal against the decision of the Liquidator but once
the claim is admitted and submitted by the Liquidator to the Adjudicating
Authority, if he receives any information, then he shall have no jurisdiction to
reject or make any modification in the claims which has already been admitted
in terms of Section 40 of the Code and has to approach the Adjudicating
Authority for the purpose of its modification which precisely has been done in
the present case by the Liquidator.
8.     Thus, it is apparent that the Tribunal has committed an error in not
appreciating Regulation 31(3) in its right perspective and rejected the application
solely on the issue that the said provision is not applicable and rather held that
Liquidator is empowered to accept or reject the claims. No other issue has been
raised. In view thereof, we are of the considered opinion that the Impugned
Order is bad in law and therefore, the same is hereby set aside.
9.     The matter is remanded back to the Learned Tribunal to decide the
application filed by the Appellant in the light of the Regulation 31(3) of the
Company Appeal (AT) (Ins.) No. 1051 of 2021
Regulations, 2016. The parties are also directed to appear before the Learned
Tribunal on 6th February, 2023. It is needless to mention that the Tribunal shall
take a decision about the application of the Liquidator in respect of the
modification of the claim, admitted by it initially, by giving a hearing to the other
party i.e. Canara Bank.
