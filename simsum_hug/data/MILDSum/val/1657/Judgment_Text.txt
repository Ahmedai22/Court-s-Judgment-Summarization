1. This criminal appeal under Section 374(2) CrPC arises out of
judgment and order dated 31st August, 1982 passed by the IVth
Additional Sessions Judge, Lucknow in Sessions Trial No.170 of
1981, convicting accused, Ram Khelawan (appellant no. 1) under
Section 302 IPC and accused Budhu and Ram Dutt (appellant no. 2)
under Section 302/34 IPC and sentenced them to undergo life
imprisonment. Accused, Ram Khelwan (appellant no. 1) had been
further convicted under Section 324 IPC and accused, Budhu and
Ram Dutt (appellant No. 2) had been convicted under Section 324/34
IPC and sentenced to undergo two years rigorous imprisonment.
2. Appeal filed by accused, Budhu, being Criminal Appeal No.685 of
1982, who was also convicted and sentenced, as noted above, has
been dismissed by this Court vide judgment and order dated
06.04.2018. While dismissing the said criminal appeal, this Court had
"We find that there are consistent statements of prosecution
witnesses on record which are also corroborated by the injury
reports as well as the opinion of the doctor with regard to
receiving fatal blow by the deceased as well as the injuries
received by Ketar. The case of the prosecution that Buddhoo
had come armed with knife giving challenge that he would not
allow Ram Beti to be married in Village Kharika and then Ram
Khelawan took knife from Buddhoo and gave knife blow at the
left hand of Ketar and thereafter Ram Dutt and Buddhoo
caught hold of Ram Deen by his hands and Ram Khelawan
gave him knife blow near his neck, go to establish that all the
accused have common intention of committing the offence of
murder. Therefore, they are liable to be convicted, having the
common intention of committing the offence, as has been
proved beyond all reasonable doubts by the statements of the
prosecution witnesses."
3. As per prosecution case, Ramdin (deceased) his brother Ketar
(injured), accused, complainant and witnesses belong to 'Mangta
Community'. All these persons were living in their huts, near Banthara
4. Ramdin and Ketar were having sister, Sarjoo, whose husband died
and, she was living in a nearby hut. Her elder daughter, Samrata was
married to Budhu. Marriage of her younger daughter, Rambeti was
arranged and settled by Ramdin and Ketar in village, Kharika. On the
date of incident, Barat was to come as marriage was scheduled. At
around, 8.30 p.m., when music was being played, two petromaxes
were burning and arrangements were being made of food etc., for the
guests etc., accused Budhu, followed by present appellants, came
there having an open knife in his hand. He challenged that he would
not allow Rambeti to get married in village Kharika from where Barat
was coming.
5. It is said that when deceased, Ramdin and his brother, injured,
Ketar tried to caution and make him understand not to make any
disturbance/turbulence in marriage, Ram Khelawan snatched the knife
from Budhu and gave knife blow on left hand of Ketar. Ramdin
intervened to save his brother and apprehend, accused, Ram
Khelawan, Budhu and Ram Dutt caught hood of his hands and Ram
Khelawan gave knife blow on neck of Ramdin, who instantly fell
down. All the accused fled away from the place of occurrence towards
6. FIR of the incident was lodged on same day at Banthara Police
7. Injured Ramdin and Ketar were sent to Sarojini Nagar Primary
Heath Center for medical aid. Since Ramdin's condition was serious,
he was referred to Balrampur Hospital where he died next morning
i.e. on 29.11.1980. After investigating the offence, charge-sheet was
filed. The accused denied charges and demanded for trial.
8. Deceased, Ramdin was initially medically examined at 9.30 p.m.
and Doctor found incised wound 3/4"x1/4" into muscle deep on the
lower part of front of middle of neck with bleeding.
9. Injured, Ketar was medically examined at 12.30 a.m. on
intervening night of 27/28.11.1980, and the Doctor found him to have
suffered incised wound 1"x1/4" into muscle deep on the dorsal surface
of left hand and one abrasion 1/4"x1/8" on the tip of left middle
10. During the course of postmortem examination of deceased,
Ramdin, which was conducted on 29.11.1980, following antemortem
injures were noticed on his body:-
1. Stitched wound 2 cm. long with one stiph on the base of the
neck left side 0.5 cm. Left to the supra esternal notch.
2. Multiple abraded contusion in an area of 5 cm. X 2.5 cm. On
the back of left elbow.
3. Abraded contusion 1.5 cm. X 0.5 cm. on the front of right leg
26 cm. below right knee.
11. As per opinion given by the Doctor, the death was caused as a
result of shock and hemorrhage due to injury no. 1, which was
sufficient in ordinary course of nature to cause death.
12. Prosecution, to prove its case, examined injured, Ketar as PW-1
and Prabhudin as PW-2, Dr. S.H.A. Rizvi, the then Medical Officer,
who was posted at PHC, Sarojini Nagar, who initially examined Ketar
and Ramdin on 27.11.1980, as PW-3, Dr. V.P. Singh, Medical Officer,
posted at Civil Hospital, Lucknow, who conducted postmortem
examination of deceased, Ramdin, as PW-4, Mr. Ram Singh, Head
Constable, who was posted as Head Mohrir at Police Station Banthara
on 27.11.1980 and prepared chick report, Exhibit Ka-1, as PW-5, and
Mr. Sukh Dev Pandey, Sub-Inspector, who conducted inquest, as PW-
6. Mr. Biraj Shyam Mishra, the Investigating Officer who completed
investigation, as PW-7.
13. After the prosecution evidence got concluded, statements of
accused were recorded under Section 313 CrPC.
14. Since one of the appellants, Ram Khelawan was absconding, the
present appeal filed by him and Ram Dutt was disconnected from
Criminal Appeal No.685 of 1982 filed by Budhu.
15. This Court has already discussed the evidence in the judgment and
order dated 06.04.2018 passed in Criminal Appeal No. 685 of 1982
and, therefore, no useful purpose would be served by extracting the
evidence on hereunder. It would be suffice to note that the place of
incident, manner in which the incident was caused, presence of the
accused and role played by them in furtherance of common intention
is fully established by injured witness and independent witness and
the evidence of two doctors, who initially conducted the medical
examination of the injured and postmortem examination of the
deceased respectively.
16. The prosecution story gets corroborated by the medical evidence
as well. There is direct evidence of injured and eye-witness, who have
fully supported the prosecution case.
17. Mr. Rajesh Kumar Dwivedi, learned Amicus, however, has
submitted that the judgment and order dated 06.04.2018 passed in
Criminal Appeal No. 685 of 1982 preferred by co-accused, Budhu
would not be binding on the present accused-appellants. This Court
should examine their case irrespective of finding recorded in the said
judgment and order. It has been further submitted that no motive is
coming forth for committing the offence by the appellants, Ram
Khelawan and Ram Dutt. As per the prosecution case, it was Budhu,
who was aggrieved by settling of marriage of Rambeti, his sister-in-
law, in village Kharika and, he came with knife. It has been further
submitted that it does not appeal to reason that Ram Khelawan would
snatch knife from Budhu and give fatal blow on deceased, Ramdin
and injure Ketar. It has been further submitted that accused, Ram Dutt
has been assigned role of catching hold of the deceased and there is no
reason to believe that the accused, Ram Khelawan, and Ram Dutt
would have common intention of committing murder of Ramdin.
There is nothing on record to suggest that the accused had come
prepared to commit the offence or there was premeditation/prior
meeting of minds of the accused for commission of offence. He has
submitted that it would not be proper to convict appellant, Ram Dutt
with aid of Section 34 IPC for offence under Section 302 IPC as role
assigned to him of catching hold of the hand of the deceased only
single blow was given on deceased, Ramdin and that too by appellant,
Ram Khelawan. Except for role of catching hold of appellant, Ram
Dutt, no other role has been assigned to him. Therefore, it has been
submitted that since there was single injury which was caused to
deceased, Ramdin by accused Ram Khelawan and Ramdin died on
next day, it is a fit case where appellant, Ram Khelawan and Ram
Dutt should be convicted under Section 304 IPC and not under
Section 302 IPC, even if the prosecution story is believed.
18. On the other hand, Mr. Umesh Verma, learned A.G.A., has
submitted that this Court, while analyzing the evidence on record, has
specifically held that the prosecution case was fully proved by
evidence on record. This Court also held that all the three accused had
common intention for committing murder and, therefore, this Court
cannot review the judgment in which specific finding that all the three
accused had common intention for committing murder has been
recorded. This Court is neither sitting in appeal nor in review against
the judgment and order dated 06.04.2018 and, therefore, the findings
recorded in judgment and order dated 06.04.2018 passed in Criminal
Appeal No.685 of 1982 are binding in the present appeal, and a
different view cannot be taken. Mr. Verma has further submitted that
even otherwise, when the prosecution has established the role of
giving knife blow by Ram Khelawan and catching hold by Budhu and
Ram Dutt, it cannot be said that all the three accused did not have
common intention to cause death of Ramdin. It is submitted that
common intention could develop instantly. Ram Khelawan assaulted
Ketar after snatching knife from Budhu and when Ramdin tried to
save him, accused Ram Dutt and Budhu caught hold of Ramdin and
accused, Ram Khelawan gave fatal blow as a result thereof, he died. It
has been further submitted that the Doctor had opined that injury no. 1
suffered by deceased, Ramdin was sufficient in ordinary course of
nature to cause death. It has been further submitted that there is no
ground to interfere with the conviction and sentence of the accused-
appellants by the trial Court and the appeal is liable to be dismissed.
19. We have considered the submissions advanced by the learned
amicus and learned Government Counsel.
20. Section 34 of the IPC creates a deeming fiction by infusing and
importing a criminal act constituting an offence committed by one
into others. It is for the prosecution to prove the common intention to
the satisfaction of the Court.
21. This Court in its judgment and order dated 06.04.2018 passed in
Criminal Appeal No.685 of 1982, after analyzing the evidence in
detail, has held that all the three accused had common intention to
commit murder of the deceased.
22. The Supreme Court in recent judgment (2022) 2 SCC 545
(Jasdeep Singh alias Jassu Vs. State of Punjab) has held that
common intention to commit an offence is a team effort akin to a
game of football involving several positions manned by many. It
would be apt to extract few paragraphs from the said judgment
"22. It is a team effort akin to a game of football involving
several positions manned by many, such as defender, mid-
fielder, striker, and a keeper. A striker may hit the target, while
a keeper may stop an attack. The consequence of the match,
either a win or a loss, is borne by all the players, though they
may have their distinct roles. A goal scored or saved may be the
final act, but the result is what matters. As against the specific
individuals who had impacted more, the result is shared
between the players. The same logic is the foundation of
Section 34 IPC which creates shared liability on those who
shared the common intention to commit the crime.
23. The intendment of Section 34 IPC is to remove the
difficulties in distinguishing the acts of individual members of a
party, acting in furtherance of a common intention. There has
to be a simultaneous conscious mind of the persons
participating in the criminal action of bringing about a
particular result. A common intention qua its existence is a
question of fact and also requires an act “in furtherance of the
said intention”. One need not search for a concrete evidence,
as it is for the court to come to a conclusion on a cumulative
assessment. It is only a rule of evidence and thus does not
create any substantive offence.
24. Normally, in an offence committed physically, the presence
of an accused charged under Section 34 IPC is required,
especially in a case where the act attributed to the accused is
one of instigation/exhortation. However, there are exceptions,
in particular, when an offence consists of diverse acts done at
different times and places. Therefore, it has to be seen on a
case-to-case basis.
25. The word “furtherance” indicates the existence of aid or
assistance in producing an effect in future. Thus, it has to be
construed as an advancement or promotion.
26. There may be cases where all acts, in general, would not
come under the purview of Section 34 IPC, but only those done
in furtherance of the common intention having adequate
connectivity. When we speak of intention it has to be one of
criminality with adequacy of knowledge of any existing fact
necessary for the proposed offence. Such an intention is meant
to assist, encourage, promote and facilitate the commission of a
crime with the requisite knowledge as aforesaid.
27. The existence of common intention is obviously the duty of
the prosecution to prove. However, a court has to analyse and
assess the evidence before implicating a person under Section
34 IPC. A mere common intention per se may not attract
Section 34 IPC, sans an action in furtherance. There may also
be cases where a person despite being an active participant in
forming a common intention to commit a crime, may actually
withdraw from it later. Of course, this is also one of the facts
for the consideration of the court. Further, the fact that all
accused charged with an offence read with Section 34 IPC are
present at the commission of the crime, without dissuading
themselves or others might well be a relevant circumstance,
provided a prior common intention is duly proved. Once again,
this is an aspect which is required to be looked into by the court
on the evidence placed before it. It may not be required on the
part of the defence to specifically raise such a plea in a case
where adequate evidence is available before the court."
23. The essence of Section 34 IPC is consensus of minds of the
persons participating in a criminal action to bring about a particular
result. It does not create any distinct offence but lays down the
principle of constructive criminal liability. The facts of this case
would disclose that all the three accused had participated in
commission of the offence inasmuch as two of them caught hold of
the deceased and one gave fatal blow on neck as a result thereof
deceased, Ramdin died. According to Doctor, who conducted autopsy
on dead-body of the deceased, the injury caused on neck of Ramdin
was sufficient in ordinary course to cause death. There is no hard and
fast rule that in case of single injury, provisions of Section 302 IPC
would not be attracted. It would depend upon facts of each case,
nature of injury, part of body where injury is caused, weapon used in
causing such injury to ascertain intention of causing death. Therefore,
the submission of learned Amicus that since single injury was caused
on neck of the deceased, the accused did not have intention to cause
death does not appeal to us.
24. The Supreme Court in (2020) 9 SCC 524 (Stalin Vs. State
Represented by the Inspector of Police) noted down on this issue,
the observations in AIR 1958 SC 465 (Virsa Singh Vs. State of
Punjab) and held in paragraph 7.2 as under:-
"7.2 From the above stated decisions, it emerges that there is no
hard and fast rule that in a case of single injury Section 302 IPC
would not be attracted. It depends upon the facts and
circumstances of each case. The nature of injury, the part of the
body where it is caused, the weapon used in causing such injury
are the indicators of the fact whether the accused caused the
death of the deceased with an intention of causing death or not.
It cannot be laid down as a rule of universal application that
whenever the death occurs on account of a single blow, Section
302 IPC is ruled out. The fact situation has to be considered in
each case, more particularly, under the circumstances narrated
hereinabove, the events which precede will also have a bearing
on the issue whether the act by which the death was caused was
done with an intention of causing death or knowledge that it is
likely to cause death, but without intention to cause death. It is
the totality of the circumstances which will decide the nature of
offence."
25. Accused, Ram Khelawan had given knife blow on neck of the
deceased which resulted into death of deceased on next day.
Considering the opinion of the Doctor, weapon used in committing
offence and body part where knife blow was given, this Court is of the
view that the accused had intention to cause death while the deceased
was caught hold by two other co-accused. In view thereof, this Court
does not find any ground to take a different view than the view which
has been taken in Criminal Appeal No.685 of 1982. In the result, this
appeal also fails and is hereby dismissed. However, considering the
fact that the incident took place in the year 1980. The appellants are in
their advance age and, therefore, the State Government should
consider their case for remission expeditiously, taking into
consideration their advance age and their conduct in jail etc. in
accordance with law.
26. We appreciate valuable assistance rendered by Mr. Rajesh Kumar
Dwivedi, learned Amicus and Mr. Umesh Verma, learned A.G.A.
during the course of hearing of this appeal.
27. We fix Rs.11,000/- to be paid to learned Amicus as fee, for
assisting the Court.
