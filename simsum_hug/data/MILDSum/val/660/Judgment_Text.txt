Counsel for Applicant :- Suresh Kumar Yadav
Counsel for Opposite Party :- G.A.
Pleadings have already been exchanged between the parties are
on the record.
Heard Shri Suresh Kumar Yadav, the learned counsel for the
applicant, learned A.G.A. for the State and perused the record.
The applicant, Puspha Devi, has moved the present bail
application seeking bail in Case Crime No. 327 of 2018, under
Learned counsel for the applicant submits that accused
applicant has falsely been implicated in the present case. It is
further submitted that the applicant was not named in the F.I.R.
and she was summoned under Section 319 Cr.P.C. on the
premise of statements of witnesses, P.W.7, P.W.9 and P.W.10 in
the trial court who have maliciously taken the name of applicant
with intention to implicate the applicant falsely. The
complainant in her statement before the trial court has not taken
the name of applicant. As per prosecution case, the main role
has been assigned to co-accused Gajraj Singh, who has already
been granted bail by a co-ordinate Bench of this Court vide
order dated 24.04.2019 passed in Bail No.8940 of 2018. One
another co-accused, Jaikaran Singh @ Chhoti, who was not
named in the F.I.R. and was summoned under Section 319
Cr.P.C. has also been granted bail by a coordinate Bench of this
Court vide order dated 26.02.2020 passed in bail No. 10612 of
2020, and the case of applicant is not on the worse footing than
that of the co-accused, Jaikaran Singh @ Chhoti, who has been
enlarged on bail.
Learned counsel for the applicant further submits that
summoning order dated 31.07.2019 is also against the spirit of
various judgments of Hon'ble Supreme Court. He placed
reliance upon a judgment of Constitution Bench of Hon'ble
Apex Court in the case of Hardeep Singh Vs. State of Punjab
& others, (2014) 3 SCC 92, wherein paragraphs-105 and 106 it
has been observed as under:-
"105. Power under Section 319 CrPC is a discretionary and an
extraordinary power. It is to be exercised sparingly and only in
those cases where the circumstances of the case so warrant. It
is not to be exercised because the Magistrate or the Sessions
Judge is of the opinion that some other person may also be
guilty of committing that offence. Only where strong and cogent
evidence occurs against a person from the evidence led before
the court that such power should be exercised and not in a
casual and cavalier manner.
106. Thus, we hold that though only a prima facie case is to be
established from the evidence led before the court, not
necessarily tested on the anvil of cross-examination, it requires
much stronger evidence than mere probability of his complicity.
The test that has to be applied is one which is more than prima
facie case as exercised at the time of framing of charge, but
short of satisfaction to an extent that the evidence, if goes
unrebutted, would lead to conviction. In the absence of such
satisfaction, the court should refrain from exercising power
under Section 319 CrPC. In Section 319 CrPC the purpose of
providing if "it appears from the evidence that any person not
being the accused has committed any offence" is clear from the
words "for which such person could be tried together with the
accused". The words used are not "for which such person could
be convicted". There is, therefore, no scope for the court acting
under Section 319 CrPC to form any opinion as to the guilt of
the accused."
The above Constitution Bench judgment was duly considered
by the Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of Labhuji Amratji
Thakor & others Vs. The State of Gujarat and another,
2018 (0) Supreme (SC) 1147. Paragraph-9 of the aforesaid
judgment reads as under:-
"9. The Constitution Bench has given a caution that power
under Section 319 Cr.P.C. is a discretionary and extraordinary
power, which should be exercised sparingly and only in those
cases where the circumstances of the case so warrant. The
crucial test, which has been laid down as noted above is "the
test that has to be applied is one which is more than prima facie
case as exercised at the time of framing of charge, but short of
satisfaction to an extent that the evidence, if goes unrebutted,
would lead to conviction." The present is a case, where the trial
court had rejected the application filed by the prosecution
under Section 319 Cr.P.C. Further, in the present case, the
complainant in the F.I.R. has not taken the names of the
appellants and after investigation in which the statement of
victim was also recorded, the names of the appellants did not
figure. After carrying investigation, the Charge Sheet was
submitted in which the appellants names were also not
mentioned as accused. In the statement recorded before the
Police, the victim has named only Natuji with whom she
admitted having physical relations and who took her and with
whom she went out of the house in the night and lived with him
on several places. The mother of victim in her statement before
the Court herself has stated that victim girl returned to the
house after one and a half months. In the statement, before the
Court, victim has narrated the entire sequence of events. She
has stated in her statement that accused Natuji used to visit her
Uncle's house Vishnuji, where she met Natuji. She, however,
stated that it was Natuji, who had given her mobile phone. Her
parents came to know about she having been given mobile
phone by Natuji, then they went to the house of Natuji and
Learned counsel for the applicant has further made reliance
upon the judgment of Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of
Brijendra Singh and others vs. State of Rajasthan, (2017) 7
SCC 706, wherein in paragraphs-13 and 15 it has been
"13. In order to answer the question, some of the principles
enunciated in Hardeep Singh?s case may be recapitulated:
Power under Section 319 Cr.P.C. can be exercised by the trial
court at any stage during the trial, i.e., before the conclusion of
trial, to summon any person as an accused and face the trial in
the ongoing case, once the trial court finds that there is some ?
evidence? against such a person on the basis of which evidence
it can be gathered that he appears to be guilty of offence. The ?
evidence? herein means the material that is brought before the
Court during trial. Insofar as the material/evidence collected
by the IO at the stage of inquiry is concerned, it can be utilised
for corroboration and to support the evidence recorded by the
Court to invoke the power under Section 319 Cr.P.C. No doubt,
such evidence that has surfaced in examination-in-chief,
without cross- examination of witnesses, can also be taken into
consideration. However, since it is a discretionary power given
to the Court under Section 319 Cr.P.C. and is also an
extraordinary one, same has to be exercised sparingly and only
in those cases where the circumstances of the case so warrants.
The degree of satisfaction is more than the degree which is
warranted at the time of framing of the charges against others
in respect of whom chargesheet was filed. Only where strong
and cogent evidence occurs against a person from the evidence
led before the Court that such power should be exercised. It is
not to be exercised in a casual or a cavalier manner. The prima
facie opinion which is to be formed requires stronger evidence
than mere probability of his complicity.
15. This record was before the trial court. Notwithstanding the
same, the trial court went by the deposition of complainant and
some other persons in their examination-in-chief, with no other
material to support their so- called verbal/ocular version. Thus,
the ?evidence? recorded during trial was nothing more than the
statements which was already there under Section 161 Cr.P.C.
recorded at the time of investigation of the case. No doubt, the
trial court would be competent to exercise its power even on the
basis of such statements recorded before it in examination-in-
chief. However, in a case like the present where plethora of
evidence was collected by the IO during investigation which
suggested otherwise, the trial court was at least duty bound to
look into the same while forming prima facie opinion and to see
as to whether ?much stronger evidence than mere possibility of
their (i.e. appellants) complicity has come on record. There is
no satisfaction of this nature. Even if we presume that the trial
court was not apprised of the same at the time when it passed
the order (as the appellants were not on the scene at that time),
what is more troubling is that even when this material on
record was specifically brought to the notice of the High Court
in the Revision Petition filed by the appellants, the High Court
too blissfully ignored the said material. Except reproducing the
discussion contained in the order of the trial court and
expressing agreement therewith, nothing more has been done.
Such orders cannot stand judicial scrutiny."
Learned counsel for the applicant has further relied upon the
judgment of Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of Periyasami and
others vs. S. Nallasamy, (2019) 4 SCC 342 wherein in
paragraphs-14 and 15 it has been observed as under:-
"14. In the First Information Report or in the statements
recorded under Section 161 of the Code, the names of the
appellants or any other description have not been given so as to
identify them. The allegations in the FIR are vague and can be
used any time to include any person in the absence of
description in the First Information Report to identify such
person. There is no assertion in respect of the villages to which
the additional accused belong. Therefore, there is no strong or
cogent evidence to make the appellants stand the trial for the
offences under Sections 147, 448, 294(b) and 506 of IPC in
view of the judgment in Hardeep Singh case (supra). The
additional accused cannot be summoned under Section 319 of
the Code in casual and cavalier manner in the absence of
strong and cogent evidence. Under Section 319 of the Code
additional accused can be summoned only if there is more than
prima facie case as is required at the time of framing of charge
but which is less than the satisfaction required at the time of
conclusion of the trial convicting the accused.
15. The High Court has set aside the order passed by the
learned Magistrate only on the basis of the statements of some
of the witnesses examined by the Complainant. Mere disclosing
the names of the appellants cannot be said to be strong and
cogent evidence to make them to stand trial for the offence
under Section 319 of the Code, especially when the
Complainant is a husband and has initiated criminal
proceedings against family of his in-laws and when their names
or other identity were not disclosed at the first opportunity."
Learned counsel for the applicant further submits that
prosecution story as set up is totally false and fabricated, no role
has been assigned to the applicant, no incriminating article has
been recovered from her possession or on her pointing out, the
recover of alleged E-Shram Card of applicant from the place of
occurrence is false and implanted by the police, there is no
strong motive against the applicant and the alleged motive of
dispute of money shown by the complainant is baseless and has
no force because the alleged amount was taken by the deceased
about ten years ago and since then there was no dispute and the
applicant has falsely been implicated in the case, therefore, she
should be released on bail by this Court sympathetically.
Several other submissions regarding legality and illegality of
the allegations made in the F.I.R. have also been placed forth
before the Court. The circumstances which, according to the
counsel, led to the false implication of the accused, have also
been touched upon at length. It has been assured on behalf of
the applicant that she is ready to cooperate with the process of
law and shall faithfully make herself available before the court
whenever required and is also ready to accept all the conditions
which the Court may deem fit to impose upon her. The
applicant undertakes that in case she is released on bail she will
not misuse the liberty of bail and will cooperate in trial. It has
also been pointed out that the applicant is not having any
criminal history, which fact has been stated in para-33 of the
affidavit filed in support of bail application. The applicant is in
jail since 21.04.2022 and that in the wake of heavy pendency of
cases in the courts, there is no likelihood of any early
conclusion of trial.
Learned A.G.A. opposed the prayer for bail, but has not
disputed that applicant was not named in the F.I.R. and her
name was surfaced for the first time in the statements of P.W.7,
P.W.9 and P.W.10.
After perusing the record in the light of the submissions made
at the Bar and after taking an overall view of all the facts and
circumstances of this case, the nature of evidence, the period of
detention already undergone, the unlikelihood of early
conclusion of trial and also the absence of any convincing
material to indicate the possibility of tampering with the
evidence, and considering the fact that the applicant was not
named in the F.I.R.; her name was taken by P.W.7, P.W.9 and
P.W.10 and she was summoned under Section 319 Cr.P.C.,
whereupon learned court below has not applied its judicial mind
and in a cursory manner summoned the applicant to face the
trial; and the main accused, Gajraj Singh has already been
granted bail; another co-accused, Jaikaran Singh @ Chhoti,
who was also not named and was summoned under Section 319
Cr.P.C., has also been granted bail, as well as considering the
larger mandate of the Article 21 of the Constitution of India and
the law laid down by the Hon'ble Apex Court in the cases of
Brijendra Singh (supra), Periyasami and others (supra) and
Dataram Singh vs. State of U.P. and another, reported in
(2018) 3 SCC 22, this Court is of the view that the applicant
may be enlarged on bail.
The prayer for bail is granted. The application is allowed.
Let the applicant, Puspha Devi, involved in Case Crime No.
327 of 2018, under Sections 302, 120-B I.P.C., Police Station
Mohammadpur Khala, District Barabanki, be enlarged on bail

following conditions :-
(1) The applicant will not make any attempt to tamper with the

(4) The applicant shall not indulge in any criminal activity or

initiate proceedings against her, in accordance with law, under
Section 174-A of the Indian Penal Code.
(6) The applicant shall remain present, in person, before the
trial court on the dates fixed for (i) opening of the case, (ii)
framing of charge and (iii) recording of statement under Section
313 Cr.P.C. If in the opinion of the trial court default of this
condition is deliberate or without sufficient cause, then it shall
be open for the trial court to treat such default as abuse of
liberty of her bail and proceed against her in accordance with
(7) The party shall file computer generated copy of such order
downloaded from the official website of High Court Allahabad
or certified copy issued from the Registry of the High Court,
(8) The concerned Court/ Authority/ Official shall verify the
authenticity of such computerized copy of the order from the
official website of High Court Allahabad and shall make a
declaration of such verification in writing.
It may be observed that in the event of any breach of the
aforesaid conditions, the court below shall be at liberty to
proceed for the cancellation of applicant's bail.
It is clarified that the observations, if any, made in this order are
strictly confined to the disposal of the bail application and must
not be construed to have any reflection on the ultimate merit of
the case.
