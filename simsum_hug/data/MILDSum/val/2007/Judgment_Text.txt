advertisement dated 17.01.2020, preparation of a fresh answer
key considering the objections raised by the petitioners for the

documents and credentials of the candidates.
The petitioners have questioned the validity of large number

It would be appropriate to reproduce the disputed questions,
the final answer based on decision of the expert committee and
view of the expert committee: -
Question No.76 of Question Booklet Series-104A:
76. From the given pairs of words you have to select the pair
which is related in the same way as the words of the first pair.
Final Answer based on decision of the expert committee: (A)
(9 of 16)    [CW-3959/2022]
View of the Expert Committee: Initially the answer was (D).
The Expert Committee opined that option (A) is more appropriate
than option (D) because word processor is a computer programme
generally used to write or process words, but as Music Comes
from Guitar, water comes from Tank.
Question No.86 of Question Booklet Series-104A:
86. Input : more fight cats cough sough acts idea.
Which of the following steps would be the last step for this input?
Final Answer based on decision of the expert committee: (C)

various steps, came to the conclusion with regard to correct
answer by indicating as under:
I.    Cough more fight cats sough acts idea
II.   Cough fight sought more cats acts idea
III. Cough fight sough acts more cats idea

Qua both these questions, the petitioners claim that the
answers must be different from what was indicated in the
preliminary answer key, and the final answer key, however, as the
petitioners had not raised any objection qua the preliminary
answer key itself, though the answer now claimed by them is
different from the preliminary answer key itself, despite grant of
the opportunity, in absence of any objection to the preliminary
answer key, the plea raised by the petitioners now cannot be
countenanced, as the objections as raised were not before the
Question No.135 of Question Booklet Series-104C:

(11 of 16)            [CW-3959/2022]
Though the petitioners have also placed on record certain
material in support of their contentions that answer “B” is correct,
however,    as  the   Expert  Committee       has after   taking   into
consideration the material, as noticed herein before, and the
material produced by the petitioners, have come to a particular
conclusion, there is apparently no reason for this Court to
substitute its opinion.
Question No.141 of Question Booklet Series-104C:
141. Jogi caste of Alwar district play which of the following
Final Answer based on decision of the expert committee: (B)
The petitioners have claimed that answer “C” is the correct
answer, however, they did not raise any objection to the
preliminary answer key, which answer has been maintained in the
final answer key by the Expert based on the material i.e. musical
repertoire of Jogi community of the Eastern Rajasthan. In absence
of any objections raised to the preliminary answer key, which
answer has been maintained, the petitioners cannot be heard in
this regard.
Question No.69 of Question Booklet Series-104D:
69. An Excel Workbook is a collection of
(C)   Charts and Worksheets        (D)   None of these
Final Answer based on decision of the expert committee: (B)
(12 of 16)           [CW-3959/2022]
The    Expert    Committee      has     relied on   NCERT     Book
Computerized Accounting System Class 12 th with the indication as
“A file in excel is known as a workbook. A
workbook is a collection of number of worksheets.”
It appears that the Expert Committee has misconstrued the
question itself as the question related to the ‘excel workbook’,
whereas the material indicated, pertains to a file in Excel only. The
material produced by the petitioners published by Vardhman
Mahaveer Open University, Kota indicates answer “C”, which
material apparently has not been considered by the Expert
Committee and, therefore, the same requires a re-look.
Question No.76 of Question Booklet Series-104D:
76. In the following letter series, some of the letters are missing
which are given in that order as one of the alternatives below it.
Choose the correct alternative. a _ bca _ bcab _ ca - bc
Final Answer based on decision of the expert committee: Deleted
Counsel for the petitioners made objections regarding
deletion of the question, however, failed to produce any material
in support of the challenge laid, as such plea raised by the counsel
for the petitioners cannot be countenanced.
Question No.98 of Question Booklet Series-104D:
98. If ‘water’ is called ‘food’, ‘food’ is called ‘tree’, ‘tree’ is called
’sky’, ‘sky’ is called ‘wall’, on which of the following grows a fruit?
(C)   Tree                     D)     None of these
Final Answer based on decision of the expert committee: (B)
No material was produced by the respondents in support of
the above change of the option. Learned counsel for the
respondent Board fairly conceded that the Board will re-consider
the option, as indicated, taking into consideration the objections
raised in the petition in this regard.
From overall consideration of all the questions regarding
which the petitioners have raised objections, except for Question
No.69 of Question Booklet Series-104D and Question No.98 of
Question Booklet Series-104D, regarding which the counsel
appearing for the Board himself conceded that same required
reconsideration, the petitioners have failed to make out any case
for interference.
This Court in Phoosgir & Ors. vs. State of Rajasthan & Ors. :
S.B. Civil Writ Petition No.17265/2021 and other connected
matters decided on 23.03.2022, in a recruitment related to
Agriculture Supervisor, came to the following conclusion: -
“From the above, it is apparent that the expert
committee has thoroughly examined the objections as raised
by the petitioners and have reached to a particular conclusion.
The petitioners have made submissions based on the material
produced by them in support of their claim in relation to each
question and the expert committee has referred to / relied on
material in support of the conclusion arrived at by them. As
out of two materials produced by the petitioners and
considered by the expert committee, which material should be
relied on, essentially is in the domain of the expert committee
and this Court, possibly cannot after the expert committee
has arrived at a particular conclusion, opine otherwise, unless
the decision made thereon is found to be wholly arbitrary and/
or contrary to the material relied on, which in the present
case does not appear to be the case.
The parameters for exercise of the jurisdiction by this
Court, qua the expert committee opinion, have been
repeatedly laid down by the Hon’ble Supreme Court and
Division bench of this Court.
The principle laid down by the Hon’ble Supreme Court,
the latest being in the case of Vikesh Kumar Gupta & Anr. v.
State of Rajasthan & Ors. : (2021) 2 SCC 309 as followed by
the Division Bench in Rajkamal Basitha v. Rajasthan High
Court, Jodhpur & Ors. : D.B.C.W.P. No.11347/2021, decided
on 21.02.2022 (at Jaipur Bench) is well settled. The Division
Bench in the case of Rajkamal Basitha (supra) observed as
"It is well settled through series of judgments of the
Supreme Court that the judicial review of the decision of
the examining body be it in the filed of education or in
the recruitment to the public employment, is extremely
limited. Particularly when the examination is being
conducted by an expert body and disputed questions are
scanned by specially constituted expert committee, the
Courts are extremely slow in interfering with the
decisions of such bodies. Unless it is pointed out that
there is a glaring error or an irrational decision has been
rendered the Court in exercise of its writ jurisdiction
under Articles 226 and 227 of the Constitution of India
would not interfere."
Prior to that in RPSC v. Pankaj Raj : D.B.S.A.W.
No.697/2019, decided on 29.05.2019 (at Jaipur Bench), the
Division Bench while setting aside the judgment of the learned
Single, inter-alia, observed as under :-
"The impugned judgment in this Court's opinion is
clearly erroneous inasmuch as the court has unwittingly
donned the robe of the decision maker: to wit, that of
an expert, in art, in concluding that one of the choices
was defective (question No.11) and that the RPSC's
explanation about a misprint was irrelevant, because the
answer was wrongly given. These conclusions the court
cannot arrive at, as they amount to primary decision
making- a task which cannot be undertaken under
Article 226. The impugned judgment also overlooked the
salutary rule that in the event of doubt, "the benefit
ought to go to the examination authority rather than to
the candidate" (Ran Vijay, supra)."
In another Division Bench judgment in Jagdish Kumar
Choudhary & Ors. v. Rajasthan Public Service Commission :
D.B.S.A.W. No.447/2020, decided on 21.10.2021, a case
where the learned Single Judge had interfered with the
decision of the expert committee, it was observed by the
Division Bench as under:-
"In our view, the learned Single Judge ought not to
have interfered with the final conclusion of the expert
body duly constituted by the Rajasthan Public Service
Commission having expertise in the field. It is not
necessary to refer to large number of decisions of this
Court as well as of Supreme Court which essentially lay
down that the interference by the High Court in matters
of education and other technical fields should be kept to
the minimum. Short reference to the decision of the
(15 of 16)            [CW-3959/2022]
Supreme Court in the case of Richal & Ors. Vs.
SCC 81] would be sufficient."
Very recently, when the learned Single Judge interfered
with the decision made by the expert committee, in relation to
Competitive Examination held by the RPSC, the Division
Bench in RPSC v. Ankit Sharma : D.B.S.A.W. No.429/2022, in
its order dated 23.02.2022, after referring to the judgments in
Ran Vijay Singh v. State of U.P. & Ors. : (2018) 2 SCC 357,
UPPSC v. Rahul Singh : (2018) 7 SCC 254, Vikesh Kumar
Gupta (supra), Bihar Staff Selection Commission & Ors. v.
Arun Kumar & Ors. : (2020) 6 SCC 362, inter-alia, observed
while staying the order of the learned Single Judge, as
"14. We have referred to the consistent trend of the
case law coming from the Supreme Court on the
subject. Broadly the approach in such situation is that
the scope of judicial review against expert’s opinion is
extremely limited. There is a requirement of finality to
the process of public employment. This is not to suggest
that judicial review is completely shutout; it cannot be.
However unless the situation presents a clear cut, black
and white, open and shut choice of the decision of the
expert body being palpably wrong, the Court would not
interfere.
An element of tolerance to the minor error or
calibration is discernible since achieving certainty and
finality is also important.
The finality and perfection are sworn enemies.
15. With this legal clarity if we revert back to the
questions with respect to which the learned Judge
objected to the conclusions of RPSC, none of these
questions would prima facie pass the muster of
extremely high threshold provided by the Supreme
Court in series of judgments noted above. In all cases
the learned Single Judge has gone on at considerable
length to discuss the view point of the petitioners and
material produced by them in support of their
contentions, what the expert committee had taken into
account and why in the opinion of the learned Judge
such conclusions were wrong. At this stage we are not
inclined to go into these questions threadbare since we
do not propose and we cannot decide these appeals
finally. Nevertheless we have strong prima facie belief
that the learned Judge had exceeded the scope of writ
jurisdiction in the present case. No legal or factual
malafides are demonstrated nor procedural illegality
established.
It may be that in some cases there is a grey area.
That by itself would not be sufficient for the writ court to
upturn the decision of the expert’s body."
(16 of 16)            [CW-3959/2022]
The Special Leave Petition filed against the Division Bench
order came to be rejected by the Hon’ble Supreme Court on
The above observations and the principle laid down therein,
apply with all force to the present case as well.
In view of above factual and legal position, wherein except
for Questions No.69 and 98 of Question Booklet Series-104D,
wherein for question No.98 of Booklet Series-104D, counsel for
the Board himself has conceded , none of the objections raised by
the candidates fall within the parameters as laid down by the
Hon’ble Supreme Court and Division Bench of this Court and,
therefore, except for the two questions, no case for interference is
made out.
Consequently, the writ petitions are partly allowed. The
respondent Board is directed to get Questions No.69 and 98 of
Booklet Series-104D and the said questions which are differently
numbered in other Booklet Series, re-examined by the Experts,
other than those, who had already examined the questions on the
earlier occasion and based on their conclusion, amend the final
answer key and give effect to the marks obtained by the
candidates and other consequential changes in the result. The
objections raised in relation to rest of the questions are rejected.
