-          Rangappa      Javoor   on  15.11.2009.     Subsequently,  disputes    arose
between the appellant - Rangappa Javoor and respondent no.2 - Geeta
On or about 17.02.2011, respondent no.2 - Geeta Javoor lodged
a          report,      resultantly    FIR   No.   9/2011   dated  17.02.2011    under
Sections 498A, 427, 504 and 506 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 and
Sections 3 and 4 of the Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961 was registered
at            Police    Station   Gadag    Town,   Gadag,   Karnataka,   against   the
appellant              -   Rangappa    Javoor.    Subsequently,   chargesheet    dated
01.05.2011 was filed before the trial court, wherein charges under
Sections             3   and   4   of   the   Dowry   Prohibition   Act,   1961   were
specifically dropped, and no reference is made to the offence under
Section 323 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860.
The parties, i.e. the appellant - Rangappa Javoor and his
wife/respondent no.2 - Geeta Javoor, thereafter, had interacted and
have entered into a settlement agreement dated 02.04.2012. A decree
of divorce by mutual consent was granted by the Court of Principal
Senior   Civil  Judge,   Gadag  vide   judgment  dated  10.04.2012.  The
parties have also agreed that FIR No. 9/2011 dated 17.02.2011,
registered at Police Station Gadag Town, Gadag, Karnataka and the
proceedings arising therefrom should be quashed.
The appellant - Rangappa Javoor had filed Criminal Petition
no. 101840/2014 before the High Court for quashing of the criminal
proceedings arising out of FIR No. 9/2011 dated 17.02.2011, albeit
by the impugned order, the High Court has rejected the prayer,
notwithstanding the fact that the parties have already settled the
Respondent    no.2  -  Geeta   Javoor,   though  served,  has  not
appeared. She has already got remarried.
It is apparent that the parties have resolved and settled
their disputes. In the facts of the caes, we do not feel that any
useful purpose would be served by continuation of the prosecution.
The appellant - Rangappa Javoor, who is an officer in the Border
Security Force and as per the job requirement, has to serve in
different parts of the country, would be put to harassment. This
court has held that in cases of offences relating to matrimonial
disputes, if the Court is satisfied that the parties have genuinely
settled the disputes amicably, then for the purpose of securing
ends  of   justice,   criminal  proceedings   inter-se  parties  can  be
quashed   by   exercising   the  powers    under  Article   142  of  the
Constitution          of     India1     or    even      under     Section   482      of   Code     of
In    view      of    the    aforesaid        position,      we  allow      the   present
appeal and set aside the impugned order. Consequently, the criminal
proceedings in charge sheet dated 17.02.2011 arising out of FIR No.
9/2011 dated 17.02.2011 under Sections 498A, 427, 504 and 506 of
the Indian Penal Code, 1860, registered at Police Station Gadag
Town, Gadag, Karnataka are quashed.
