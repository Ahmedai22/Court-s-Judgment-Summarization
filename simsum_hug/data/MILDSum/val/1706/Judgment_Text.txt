Case :­ HABEAS CORPUS WRIT PETITION No. ­ 315 of
Counsel for Petitioner :­ Avinash Pandey
Counsel for Respondent :­ G.A.
1.    Heard Sri Avinash Pandey, learned counsel for the
petitioners and Ms. Rachna Tiwari, learned Additional
Government Advocate appearing for the State­respondents.
2.    The undisputed facts as reflected from the pleadings
on record are that the petitioner no.2, wife of the petitioner
no.1, left her matrimonial home sometime in the month of
June, 2019 on account of some serious differences with her
husband (petitioner no.1) and an application for restitution
of conjugal rights was filed by the petitioner no.1 which was
registered as Case No. 772 of 2019 (Mohd. Ahmad vs.
Arshi) and the same is stated to be pending before the court
of the Principal Judge, Family Court, Saharanpur.
3.    Counsel for the petitioners has sought to contend that
subsequent thereto sometime in the month of November,
2020 an information was received by him suggesting that
petitioner no.2 was being detained at her parental home
and in regard to the same certain applications are also
stated to have been moved by him before the respondent
4.     Learned Additional Government Advocate submits
that once it has been admitted that the petitioner no.2
(wife) left her matrimonial home sometime in the month of
June, 2019 on account of serious differences with her
husband (petitioner no.1), it is not a case of illegal
detention and a writ of habeas corpus would not be
entertainable. This would be moreso for the reason that an
application seeking restitution of conjugal rights is stated to
have been filed by the petitioner no.1 and the same is
5.     Learned counsel for the petitioners has not disputed
the factual position with regard to the petitioner no.2
having left her matrimonial home in the month of June,
2019 and also that she has not returned back thereafter.
6.     There is no material on record to suggest that the
petitioner no.2 was forcibly taken away; rather the facts
indicate that the petitioner no.2 left her matrimonial home
on her own accord on account of some serious differences
with her husband (petitioner no.1). The application seeking
restitution of conjugal rights, filed by the petitioner no.1­
husband, contains a clear narration of facts in this regard.
7.     The writ of habeas corpus is a prerogative writ and an
extraordinary remedy. It is writ of right and not a writ of
course and may be granted only on reasonable ground or
probable cause being shown, as held in Mohammad Ikram
Hussain v State of U.P. and others 1 and Kanu Sanyal v
8.     The writ of habeas corpus has been held as a festinum
remedium and accordingly the power would be exercisable
in a clear case. The remedy of writ of habeas corpus at the
instance of a person seeking to obtain possession of
someone whom he claims to be his wife would therefore not
be available as a matter of course. The observations made in
the decision in Mohammad Ikram Hussain (supra) in this
"13. Exigence of the writ at the instance of a husband is
very rare in English Law, and in India the writ of habeas
corpus is probably never used by a husband to regain his
wife and the alternative remedy under S. 100 of the Code
of Criminal Procedure is always used. Then there is the
remedy of civil suit for restitution of conjugal rights.
Husbands take recourse to the latter when the detention
does not amount to an offence and to the former if it does.
In both these remedies all the issues of fact can be tried and
the writ of habeas corpus is probably not demanded in
similar cases if issues of fact have first to be established.
This is because the writ of habeas corpus is festinum
remedium and the power can only be exercised in a clear
case. It is of course singularly inappropriate in cases where
the petitioner is himself charged with a criminal offence in
respect of the very person for whose custody he demands
9.     The exercise of the extraordinary jurisdiction for
issuance of a writ of habeas corpus would be dependent on
the jurisdictional fact where the applicant establishes a
prima facie case that the detention is unlawful. It is only
where the aforementioned jurisdictional fact is established
that the applicant becomes entitled to the writ as of right.
10.    In view of the other remedies available for the purpose
under criminal and civil law, issuance of a writ of habeas
corpus at the behest of a husband to regain his wife may not
be available as a matter of course and the power in this
regard may be exercised only when a clear case is made out.
11.    The aforementioned legal position has been stated in
recent decision of this Court in Soniya and Another vs.
State of U.P. and Others3 and subsequently reiterated in
Manjita Devi and another vs. State of U.P. and Others4.
12.    In the facts of the present case, the petitioner no.2
having left her matrimonial home on her own on account of
a matrimonial discord, the present petition seeking a writ of
habeas corpus at the behest of the petitioner no.1 (husband)
would not be entertainable.
13.    Proceedings for restitution of conjugal rights being
pending between the parties before the Family Court, it is
open to the petitioner no.1 to pursue the said remedy.
14.    Subject to the aforesaid observation the petition
stands dismissed.
