Ltd, who is the 2nd respondent in O.P.(M.V)
No.84/2009 on the file of the Motor Accidents
Claim Tribunal, Kasaragod, is the appellant
herein.     The   respondents      are   the   original
petitioner      as   well     as    the   original    1st
respondent before the Tribunal.
2.   The      Insurance       Company     disputed
liability       and     sought     exoneration      from
liability     raising     contention     that   the   1st
respondent/injured was a gratuitous passenger
in a goods vehicle viz., Goods Autorickshaw
bearing    registration      no.KL-14G-3792.      Though
the   appellant     sought     for   exoneration,    the
Tribunal did not allow the same.
3.   Heard    the   learned     counsel   for   the
4.    It is argued by the learned counsel
for the appellant that the Tribunal negatived
the contention raised by the Insurance Company
to grant full exoneration without rationale
though the 1st respondent/original petitioner
was    travelling     in   the   goods   autorickshaw
involved     in   the  accident   after   sharing   the
seat    of   the   driver   where  driver   alone   was
permitted to travel.        According to the learned
counsel the finding of the Tribunal giving the
1st  respondent/petitioner        the   status   of   a
person accompanying the goods carried therein
is unsustainable. The learned counsel for the
appellant placed decision reported in United
India Insurance Co. Ltd. v. Suresh K.K and
another : 2008 (12) SCC 657; 2008 KHC 4602 in
support of this contention.         In this decision
it was held      that if the claimant had not been
travelling      in  the   vehicle  as  owner   of   the
goods, he shall not be covered by the policy
of the insurance. In any view of the matter in
a  three    wheeler    goods    carriage,    the  driver
could not have allowed anybody else to share
his   seat.     No   other     person    whether   as   a
passenger or as a owner of the vehicle is
supposed    to   share    the   seat   of   the  driver.
Violation of the condition of the contract of
insurance, therefore, is approved.
5.   To be on the facts of this case, in
order to answer the challenge raised by the
learned     counsel      for     the    appellant,     on
23.01.2008     at   about   14:30    hours,   while   the
injured    was     travelling     in   a   Bajaj   Goods
Autorickshaw      bearing   registration      no.KL-14G-
3792 along with construction goods to the work
site by sitting near the driver of the vehicle
and transporting the construction goods, he
met     with     an    accident      when     the   said
Autorickshaw suddenly turned by its driver.
The injured being the original petitioner/1st
respondent      herein    claimed      Rs.1,50,000/-      as
6.   1st   respondent,      the    owner-cum-driver
was set ex-parte by the Tribunal.
7.   The 2nd respondent - insurer/appellant
filed    a    written     statement       disputing      the
negligence       and    denying      liability      raising
specific      contention       that     the     injured/1st
respondent     was    a  gratuitous      passenger     in  a
goods vehicle. But the Tribual disowned the
contention and found liability on the part of
the insurer.
8.   Now,     the   learned      counsel      for   the
appellant canvassed exoneration of liability
fastened on the appellant Insurance Company.
9.   In    order    to   resolve      the   question,
reference      to    Sections     147     of    the    Motor
Vehicles    Act    is   necessary     and    the   same   is
"147.   Requirements   of   policies   and
limits of liability. (1) In order to
comply     the     requirements     of   this

Explanation.     For   the    removal   of
doubts, it is hereby declared that the
death   of   or  bodily   injury   to  any
person or damage to any property of a
third party shall be deemed to have
been caused by or to have arisen out
of, the use of a vehicle in a public
place notwithstanding that the person
who is dead or injured or the property
which is damaged was not in a public
place at the time of the accident, if
the act or omission which led to the
accident occurred in a public place.”
10. After reading Section 147 of the Motor
Vehicles     Act,     it   is    necessary     to   have a
glimpse on judicial pronouncements relevant on
this question, while interpreting Section 147
of   the   Motor    Vehicles       Act.    In    New   India
Assurance Co. Ltd v. Asha Rani :              2003 (1) KLT
165 (SC) the question raised was whether the
insurer is liable to pay compensation to the
dependents of a deceased passenger while the
deceased was travelling in a goods vehicle. In
that case the vehicle met with an accident, on
account    of    which    the    passenger       died.   The
Supreme Court after considering the relevant
“In Satpal's case (AIR 2000 SC 235)
the Court assumed that the provisions
of S.95(1) of Motor Vehicles Act, 1939
are  identical   with   S.147(1)   of   the
Motor Vehicles Act, 1988, as it stood
prior to its amendment. But a careful
scrutiny of the provisions would make
it clear that prior to the amendment
of 1994 it was not necessary for the
insurer to insure against the owner of
the    goods     or     his    authorized
representative    being   carried    in   a
goods   vehicle.     On    an    erroneous
impression   this   Court   came   to   the
conclusion that the insurer would be
liable to pay compensation in respect
of the death or bodily injury caused
to either the owner of the goods or
his   authorized     representative       when
being carried in a goods vehicle the
accident    occurred.      If     the    Motor
Vehicles   Amendment     Act    of   1994   is
examined, particularly S.46 of Act 6
of 1994 by which expression 'injury to
any person' in the original Act stood
substituted by the expression 'injury
to any person including owner of the
goods or his authorized representative
carried in the vehicle' the conclusion
is  irresistible     that    prior    to   the
aforesaid amendment Act of 1994, even
if widest interpretation is given to
the expression 'to any person' it will
not  cover   either    the   owner    of   the
goods or his authorized representative
being   carried   in    the    vehicle.    The
objects   and   reasons     of   Cl.46    also
states that it seeks to amend S.147 to
include   owner   of   the   goods    or   his
authorized   representative       carried   in
the   vehicle    for    the     purposes    of
liability under the insurance policy.
It is no doubt true that sometimes the
Legislature amends the law by way of
amplification and clarification of and
inherent   position   which     is  there   in
the statute, but a plain meaning being
given  to    the   words    used    1   in   the
statute,    as   it   stood    prior    to   its
amendment of 1994, and as it stands
subsequent    to   its   amendment     in   1994
and bearing in mind the objects and
reasons    engrafted       in    the    amended
provisions referred to earlier, it is
difficult for us to construe that the
expression     'including      owner    of   the
goods or his authorized representative
carried   in    the    vehicle'     which    was
added  to    the   pre-existed      expression
'injury    to    any    person'     is   either
clarificatory or amplification of the
pre-existing     statute.      On   the    other
hand it clearly demonstrates that the
Legislature wanted to bring within the
sweep    of     S.147      and     making     it
compulsory for the insurer to insure
even in case of a goods vehicle, the
owner of the goods or his authorized
representative      being     carried     in   a
goods  vehicle     when   that    vehicle    met
with an accident and the owner of the
goods   or    his   representative       either
dies  or    suffers     bodily    injury.    The
judgment    of   this    Court    in   Satpal's
case, therefore must be held to have
not  been    correctly     decided     and   the
impugned judgment of the tribunal as
well   as    that    of    the    High     Court
accordingly  are   set   aside  and  these
appeals are allowed It is held that
the  insurer  will   not   be  liable  for
compensation to the owner of goods or
his authorized representative on being
carried in a goods vehicle when that
meets with an accident and the owner
of goods or his representative dies or
suffers any bodily injury.
The  changes  made   by   substitution  of
S.147 of the Act by S.46 of the Act 54
of   1994    (w.e.f     14.11.1994)    was
considered by the Supreme Court in the
above decision.”
11. The Apex Court in National Insurance
Co. Ltd. v. Ajit Kumar and others : AIR 2003
SC 3093 also considered the ratio in New India
Assurance Co. Ltd. v. Satpal Singh : AIR 2000
SC 235 and found that it has no application
after the amendment of S.147 of the MV Act. In
National    Insurance     Co.    Ltd.     v.  Chinnamma   :
2004 (3) KLT 397, three bench Judges of the
Apex   Court,     considered      the    question     as to
whether the owner of goods travelling in a
trailer attached to the tractor was entitled
to the insurance coverage before the amendment
of S.147 of the MV Act. It was answered that
an insurance for an owner of the goods or his
authorized     representative     travelling     in  a
vehicle    became    compulsory   only   with   effect
from 14.11.1994, i.e., from the date of coming
into force of amending Act 54 of 1994. The
Apex Court considered the question whether a
person who hired a goods carriage would come
within the purview of S.147(1) of the MV Act
although no goods as such were carried in the
vehicle at the time of accident. Though this
Court had taken a view in this case that such
a person also will be covered under S.147(1)
of   the   Act,    that    decision  was   challenged
before the Supreme Court and the Supreme Court
held    as   stated     in   paragraph   4   of   this
12. Again in United India Insurance Co.
Ltd. v. Suresh : 2008 (4) KLT 552 (SC) when
the Apex Court considered the question whether
a person who hired a goods vehicle would come
within the purview of S.147(1) of the Act,
although no goods were being carried at the
time of the accident. In this decision the
Apex Court reiterated the legal position as
laid down in National Insurance Co. Ltd. v.
SCC 1 that the term "any person” envisaged
under   S.147(1)(b)(i)    shall  not  include any
gratuitous passenger, it was held that if the
claimant     had   not  been  travelling   in the
vehicle as owner of the goods, he shall not be
covered by the policy of insurance. To put it
differently, no gratuitous passenger can be
allowed to travel in a goods vehicle and not
even the owner of the vehicle can share the
seat of the driver in a goods autorickshaw.
13. Thus, law in no more res integra on
the point that, if the claimant had not been
travelling     in  the    vehicle   as  owner   of  the
goods, he shall not be covered by the policy
of insurance. Further in a three wheeler goods
carriage, the driver could not have allowed
anybody    else   to    share   his   seat.  No   other
person whether a passenger or as a owner of
the vehicle is supposed to share the seat of
the driver and any such action is violation of
the policy conditions. Here, the case put up
by the appellant/insurer is that, the injured
was accompanying the Goods Autorickshaw along
with construction goods to the work site after
sharing the seat of the driver and met with an
accident    during    this    course.   Ext.B1   policy
would show that the seating capacity of the
vehicle involved in the accident is one person
and nobody is permitted to travel in the said
Goods    Autorickshaw,     other   than   the  driver.
Dealing    with   similar    case   as  discussed   the
Honourable Supreme Court held that no other
person whether as passenger or as owner of the
vehicle is supposed to share the seat of the
driver and the said action is violation of the
condition of the contract of insurance.
14. In      the      three     bench      decision  in
National Insurance Co. Ltd. v. Baljit Kaur :
AIR 2004 SC 1340 also while summarizing the
legal position, the Honourable Supreme Court
“21.   The   upshot    of   the   aforementioned
discussions is that instead and in place of
the insurer the owner of the vehicle shall
be   liable    to   satisfy   the   decree.  The
question, however, would be as to whether
keeping in view the fact that the laws was
not clear so long such a direction would be
fair and equitable. We do not think so. We,
therefore, clarify the legal position which
shall have prospective effect. The Tribunal
as also the High Court had proceeded in
terms of the decisions of this Court in
Satpal Singh ((2000) 1 SCC 237). The said
decision has been overruled only in Asha
therefore,    are   of  the   opinion   that the
interest of justice will be sub-served if
the appellant herein is directed to satisfy
the   awarded  amount   in   favour  of   the
claimant   if  not  already   satisfied   and
recover  the  same from   the  owner  of  the
vehicle. For the purpose of such recovery,
it would not be necessary for the insurer
to file a separate suit but it may initiate
a proceeding before the executing Court as
if the dispute between the insurer and the
owner    was   the    subject    matter    of
determination before the tribunal and the
issue is decided against the owner and in
favour of the insurer. We have issued the
aforementioned directions having regard to
the scope and purport of S.168 of the Motor
Vehicles Act, 1988 in terms whereof it is
not only entitled to determine the amount
of claim as put forth by the claimant for
recovery thereof from the insurer, owner or
driver of the vehicle jointly or severally
but also the dispute between the insurer on
the one hand and the owner or driver of the
vehicle involved in the accident inasmuch
as can be resolved by the tribunal in such
a proceeding.”
To    sum   up,   it     is   held    that   the
contention raised by the appellant urging full
exoneration      is   to   be    allowed     and    contra
decision entered into by the Tribunal stands
set aside.       Resultantly, it is ordered that
the Insurance Company is not liable to pay the
amount and the liability is upon the owner of
the vehicle. Accordingly, the pay and recovery
right ordered against the appellant Insurance
Company    is   set  aside    and the  appellant  is
exonerated     from   liability.  Thus  it  is  held
that 1st respondent, the owner of the vehicle
is liable to pay the award amount granted by
the Tribunal in this case.
In the result, this appeal is allowed
as indicated above.
