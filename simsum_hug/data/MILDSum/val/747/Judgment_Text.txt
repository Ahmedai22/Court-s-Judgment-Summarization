Case :- CRIMINAL MISC. WRIT PETITION No. - 1174 of 2022
Heard Sri R.K. Ojha, learned Senior Advocate for the petitioners and learned
The instant writ petition seeks quashing of the first information report dated
04.11.2021 giving rise to Case Crime No.689 of 2021, under Sections
8/20/25/29 of Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985 P.S.
Shikohabad, District Firozabad, in respect of the petitioners only.
The second prayer made in the writ petition is for quashing the
notice/summon dated 01.01.2022 issued to the petitioners under Sections 67
of N.D.P.S. Act. This notice is in connection with Case Crime No.689 of
2021 which is subject matter of the first prayer.
The consequential and the third relief is that no coercive decision shall be
taken in pursuance of the notice/summon dated 01.01.2022.
It appears that the police on receipt of information apprehended a truck and
upon its search recovered four quintals forty one kilograms of ganja from a
concealed space in the driverâ€™s cabin. Two persons in the truck, were
arrested and the recovery memo was prepared. The date of the afore noted
recovery is 04.11.2021 and thereafter, the F.I.R. was registered.
It appears that subsequently, notices under Section 67 of the N.D.P.S. Act
have been issued to the petitioners on 01.01.2022. It also appears on the
record that subsequent to the receipt of the notice/summon, the petitioners
have sent letters expressing their inability to appear in response to the notice/
summon, along with a prayer that the statements be recorded in District
Hathras. The notice required the petitioners to appear in the Narcotics
Control Bureau Office at Lucknow on 05.01.2022 at 3 pm. The replies
annexed along with the writ petition are dated 03.01.2022.
The contention of Sri Ojha, learned Senior Advocate is that prior to the
issuance of notice, some personnel claiming to be of the Narcotics Control
Bureau had come to the residence of the petitioners and had tried to
apprehend them. This was opposed by the petitioners and their family
members. As a consequence, the personnel of the Narcotics Control Bureau
were aggrieved and, therefore, the notice has been issued to the petitioners.
It is also submitted that the petitioners apprehend that once they appear in
consequence of the notice issued to them, the Investigating Officer after
recording their statements under Section 161 Cr.P.C. in all likelihood, will
arrest them. Of the three petitioners, one is a practising lawyer and the other
two are the father and the brother of the practising lawyer. Since they have
no concern with Case Crime No.689 of 2021, they are entitled to the
protection claimed in the writ petition.
In so far as the first relief claimed in the writ petition is concerned, the
petitioners are not named in the F.I.R. They therefore, cannot be aggrieved
by it, in any manner. For the reason, they cannot challenge the same.
Although confronted with the situation, Sri Ojha submitted that he is not
pressing relief no. 1.
In so far as the challenge to the summon/notice dated 01.01.2022 is
concerned, in our considered opinion challenge to a notice is not tenable
even if the person, who, is required to respond to it is a practising lawyer or
his relative. The investigating agency and the investigating officer have
unfettered power of investigation. It is also not open for the person, who is
to be interrogated or questioned to decide the venue of such interrogation.
Moreover, if as claimed, the petitioners have no nexus with Case Crime No.
689 of 2021. This Court fails to understand as to what prevents them from
appearing before the officer concerned in pursuance of the notice issued to
We are also of the considered opinion that the writ petition has been filed on
mere apprehension. However, since the High Court in exercise of power
under Article 226 of the Constitution of India, has no power to interfere with
the investigation, the relief prayed for in the writ petition for protection is
not liable to be granted and that too on mere apprehension.
Accordingly, we do not find it a fit case for interference.
The writ petition is dismissed.
