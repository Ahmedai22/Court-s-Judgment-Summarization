1.    Heard Sri Satya Prakash Rathor, learned Amicus Curiae for the
appellant and Sri S.B. Maurya, learned counsel for the State and perused the
material on record.
2.    This jail appeal has been filed by the appellant Gabbar Patel @
Dharmendra challenging the impugned judgement and order dated
25.09.2006 passed by Additional District & Sessions Judge, Court No. 14,
Varanasi in Sessions Trial No. 784 of 2004, by which he has been convicted
and sentenced under Section 307 I.P.C. to undergo three years and six
months rigorous imprisonment.
3.    The prosecution case as per the First Information Report lodged on
04.03.2003 at about 01:40 am is that the police informer informed the police
that one person standing at Jalalpur Mod and is about to commit an incident
who is having narcotics and a country made pistol with him, on which, the
S.O. Sunil Kumar Bisnoi along with his accompanying police personnels
proceeded towards the said person. They had torch with them. The said
person all of sudden fired upon them to which they escaped and then they
followed him after which near Jalalpur Mod he showed them his weapon but
they arrested him on 03.03.2003 at about 23:40 hrs after overpowering him.
They recovered a 12 bore country made pistol from his right hand and
immediately upon opening its barrel found an empty cartridge. The said
person was asked about his identity to which he disclosed that his name is
Gabbar Patel @ Dharmenndra Patel and told his fatherâ€™s name and
address. He further told them that he has diazepam tablets with him. He
told them to take his search after which from his left pocket something
wrapped in paper was found, on opening of which small tablets were
recovered which were on counting found to be 300 tablets. The country
made pistol, empty cartridge and the tablets were recovered and a recovery
memo was prepared which was duly signed by him. The said recovery
memo is Exb: Ka-1 to the records.
4.      On the basis of the said recovery memo, a First Information Report
was lodged on 04.03.2003 at 01:40 am as Case Crime No. 29 of 2003
under Section 307 IPC, Case Crime No. 30 of 2003, under Section 3/25
Arms Act and Case Crime No. 31 of 2003, under Section 8/22 of N.D.P.S.
5.     The matter was investigated and a charge sheet no. 34 of 2003 dated
24.03.2003 was filed against the accused-appellant Gabbar Patel @
Dharmendra under Section 307 I.P.C. The same is Ex. Ka- 5 to the records.
6.     Vide order dated 03.05.2005 passed by the Additional Sessions
Judge, Court No. 14, Varanasi charge was framed under Section 307 I.P.C.
against the accused Gabbar Patel @ Dharmendra. He pleaded not guilty
and claimed to be tried.
7.     In the trial, Sup-Inspector Ajay Srivastava was examined as PW-1.
Amongst the prosecution documents, the recovery memo was produced as
Exb: Ka-1, the Chik FIR was Exb: Ka-2, the GD of registration of the FIR
was Exb: Ka-3, site plan was Exb: Ka-4 and the charge sheet was Exb: Ka-
5 to the records.
8.     After recording of the evidence of PW-1, the accused in his
statement recorded under Section 313 Cr.P.C. in reply to question no. 4
stated that he committed a fault. He pleads guilty. Further, to question no.
6 he states that he is in jail since long time and as such leniency be shown.
The trial court thus after his confession under Section 313 Cr.P.C.
concludes the trial as passed the impugned judgment by stating that on the
basis of statement of PW-1 and the recovery memo along with the
confession of the accused-appellant, the prosecution has succeeded its case
beyond reasonable doubt and convicts him as stated above.
9.      PW-1 Ajay Srivastaava was posted as Chowki In-charge Harhua,
Police Station Bada Gaon, District Varanasi. On the day of the incident, he
was standing with the S.O. at Jamalpur Mod and were talking about
miscreants, on which, the police informer came and on his information and
pointing out an effort was made to arrest the accused-appellant after which
he fired upon the police party from his country made pistol but the police
party was saved and no one received injury. He was overpowered and was
apprehended along with 12 bore country made pistol, one live cartridge
and one empty cartridge along with 300 tablets of diazepam. The recovery
memo was prepared on the dictation of S.O. Sunil Kumar. The articles
were sealed and the accused was brought to the Police Station and the First
Information Report was lodged. He proves the handwriting of the Head
Constable who transcribed the First Information Report. The investigation
was given to Sup-Inspector Vipin Kumar Rai who concluded it and filed a
charge sheet. He proves the handwriting of Vipin Kumar Rai also. No
cross examination was done.
10.     The accused then in reply to question no. 4 in his statement recorded
under Section 313 Cr.P.C. was asked as to why a case has been lodged
against him, to which, he states that he is at fault. He admits his guilt. In
reply to the question no.1 with regards to his making a fire on the police
party, he states that it is true. He further with regards to the recovery of the
weapon and the recovery memo, does not say anything. Further, in reply to
the documents and investigation he does not say anything. In the last reply
to a question no. 6 as to whether he wants to say anything, he states that he
is in jail since a long time and leniency be shown to him.
11.    The trial court came to a conclusion that the prosecution has proved
its case beyond reasonable doubts on the basis of the statement of PW-1
Ajay Srivastava, the recovery memo Exb: Ka-1 and acceptance of guilt by
the accused in his statement recorded under Section 313 Cr.P.C. and thus
convicts him as stated above.
12.    Learned Amicus Curiae argued that the view as taken by the trial
court is fully perverse and illegal. The prosecution has to stand on its own
leg and prove its case beyond reasonable doubt. It is argued that admittedly
the present case is a case of no injury. The recovery memo although is on
record and has been exhibited by the prosecution but there is no
corroborative evidence to show the use of the said weapon in the present
case. There is no opinion of any expert or even evidence to the effect that
the said weapon was sent for analysis to show that there was fire made by
the accused-appellant. The corroboration in so far as the use of the said
weapon is concerned, is missing. It is argued that even the prosecution has
not come forward to show that the said weapon was sent to the ballistic
expert for its testing which would go to corroborate its use in the present
case. It is argued that merely by pleading guilty in the statement recorded
under Section 313 Cr.P.C., the accused cannot be held guilty. At the stage
of framing of charge, the accused had pleaded not guilty and claimed to be
tried. It was the duty of the prosecution to stand on its leg to show the
involvement of the appellant. It is argued that the impugned judgment and
order deserves to be set aside and the appellant deserves be acquitted.
13.    Per contra, learned counsel for the State opposed the arguments of
learned Amicus Cruiae and argued that the statement of PW-1 has clinched
the issue. The implication of the appellant is there. He was apprehended at
the spot with the weapon by which he made a fire. The accused has
confessed his guilt in his statement under Section 313 Cr.P.C. The same are
sufficient to reach to a conclusion of his being involved in the matter and
convict him. Hence, the appeal deserves to be dismissed.
14.    After having heard learned counsels for the parties and perusing the
records, the issue involved in the present matter lies in a small compass. It
is as to whether after pleading guilty in the statement recorded under
Section 313 Cr.P.C. and the prosecution proving the recovery memo and
one witness coming and the deposing against the accused who was one of
the team members of the arresting team, is sufficient for conviction or not.
Admittedly, the present case is a case of no injury. It is stated that the
accused made a solitary fire but the same did not hit anyone. He was later
on overpowered and apprehended and stated to be having a 12 bore
country made pistol with one empty cartridge along with one live cartridge
in his possession. The said articles were recovered from him.
15.    The prosecution is silent as to whether the said weapon was sent to
the ballistic expert for examination which would corroborate its use at that
point of time. Mere recovery of a weapon and one empty cartridge would
not be sufficient to prove the use of the said weapon without any
corroborating evidence.
16.    The next question which crops up is as to whether the accused if
pleads guilty in his statement under Section 313 Cr.P.C. is also the
circumstance to rest against him or not. In the present case, as has been
stated above after charges were framed by the concerned court, the accused
had pleaded not guilty and had claimed to be tried.
In his statement recorded under Section 313 Cr.P.C. he has not given
any reply to certain questions and further states of his being guilty and then
in addition states of the court taking a lenient view in the sentence as he is
in jail since long time. Law as it stands undisputed is that the statement
under Section 313 Cr.P.C. is not evidence. It is not a substantive peace of
evidence. It can be used for appreciating evidence led by the prosecution to
accept or reject it. However, it cannot be said to be a substitute for the
prosecution evidence. It is only the version or stand of the accused by way
of explanation to a question put by the prosecution regarding incriminating
material appearing against him which are brought to his notice and he is
given a chance to reply them. The statement is not made on oath. Yet it can
be taken into consideration at the trial against an accused for arriving at his
guilty or otherwise but the prosecution has to at the very first instance
prove its case beyond reasonable doubts against him and then his
explanation or answer to such incriminating circumstance should be
looked into. It cannot be said that mere stating of being guilty in the
statement under Section 313 Cr.P.C. will end the issue and would lead the
route only to the guilt of the accused without prosecution establishing its
case beyond reasonable doubt against him through cogent, reliable and
admissible evidence.
17.    In the present case, there is no other witness examined by the
prosecution. Although, the quality of evidence is needed in a case and not
the quantity. In the present case, only one witness was examined who was
a member of the said police team. He has deposed for each and everything
of the case. The corroboration of the use of the weapon is not present. The
weapon was not sent for expert analysis. The case is a no injury case. It
cannot be said that merely by pleading guilty in the statement under
Section 313 Cr.P.C. the accused can be pinned down and a conviction can
be recorded against him.
18.    Looking to the facts and circumstances of the case and in view of
the above discussion as done, the accused-appellant deserves to be
extended the benefit of doubt and as such the present appeal is allowed.
The appellant is acquitted of the charges levelled against him. The
appellant if is in jail, shall be released forthwith.
19.    Office is directed to transmit the lower court records along with the
copy of this judgment to the trial court forthwith for its compliance and
necessary action.
20.    Sri Satya Prakash Rathor, learned Amicus Curiae who was
appointed Amicus Curiae vide order dated 04.08.2022 passed by this Court
assisted the Court in deciding the appeal.
21.    Office is directed to pay a sum of Rs. 8,000/- for assistance of the
Court to learned Amicus Curiae within two months from today.
