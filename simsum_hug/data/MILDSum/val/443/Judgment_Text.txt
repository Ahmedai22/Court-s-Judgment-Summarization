2.            Both Appeals question legality of Judgment and Order dated
18.08.2015 passed by learned Additional Sessions Judge, Palghar in
Sessions Case No. 31 of 2011, convicting both Appellants under
Section 235(2) of the Code of Criminal Procedure Code, 1973 (for
short “Cr.P.C.”) for offence punishable under Section 302 read with 34
of The Indian Penal Code, 1860 (for short “IPC”) and sentencing both
to suffer imprisonment for life with fine of Rs. 1000/- each, in default,
to suffer rigorous imprisonment for one month.
3.            Shorn of unnecessary details, facts of prosecution case which
emerge from the record are as follows:
3.1.          Sakharam (20 years old) was having a love affair with
Jyotsna, daughter of Appellant No.1 and sister of Appellant No.2.
Appellants’ family were against their relationship and alliance since
they belonged to different castes. One year prior to incident, Appellant
No.1 visited house of PW-1 and informed them that he will not
perform marriage of his daughter Joystna with Sakharam and they
should search for another bride. Some months prior to the incident,
Appellant No.2 assaulted Sakharam and snatched his bicycle near

Cri. Appeal.1032.15 and 1033.15(ii).doc
Umbergaon and threatened that he will murder him if he continued
his alliance with Jyotsna.
3.2.          On 22.01.2011, at about 06:30 p.m. Sakharam Sukhad
Kherva (hereinafter to be referred as “Sakharam”) was returning home
from work on his bicycle                     He was confronted by Appellants on the
road near Karajgaon who came on motorcycle and assaulted him with
a blunt object on his head and he was seriously injured. PW-3 Datta
Soma Thapad informed PW-1 Ganpat Khevra about the incident. PW-1,
along with younger brother Arvind and other villagers proceeded to
Karajgaon and found Sakharam lying in a pool of blood.
3.3.          PW-1 enquired with bystanders about the incident and
learnt that Appellant No.2 and one other person came on motorcycle
and assaulted Sakharam; that Appellant No. 2 caught hold of
Sakharam from behind and the other person accompanying him gave a
blow with hammer on his head leading to bleeding injury; that
Appellants continued giving kicks and abused him and only when
people gathered around them, they ran away on their motocycle.
Sakharam was taken to hospital by PW-1 and others where he was
declared dead on admission.
3.4.          PW-1 lodged First Information Report (for short “FIR”) and
criminal law was set into motion. CR No. I-7/2011 came to be
registered. PW-10 Dilip S. Pawar Investigating Officer(“I.O.”) arrested

Cri. Appeal.1032.15 and 1033.15(ii).doc
Appellants on the same night at about 09:30 p.m.
3.5.          PW-10 conducted inquest panchanama (Exh. 25) of the dead
body of Sakharam. He carried out recovery and seizure panchanama
(Exh. 38) of blood stained clothes of both accused ‘Article Nos. 2, 3, 4
and 5’ which they had worn at the time of incident. Clothes worn by
deceased Sakharam were seized (Exh. 50) and marked as ‘Article Nos.
6, 7 and 8. PW-10 sent the seized articles to the Chemical Analyzer for
forensic analysis. C.A. Reports (Exh.52 and Exh.53) vide covering
letter dated 06.02.2011 (Exh.51) were produced in evidence. PW- 10
conducted Spot panchanama (Exh.29) and the soil and soil mixed with
blood. On 23.01.2011 Appellant no.1 made a voluntary statement to
the IO and showed the place where the blood-stained hammer
(weapon) and motorcycle were concealed by him. PW-10 prepared
seizure memo (Exh.35A) of weapon (hammer) and motorcycle used
by Appellants. After investigation charge-sheet was filed in the Court
Since the offence under Section 302 IPC is exclusively triable
by Court of Sessions, case was committed to the Sessions Court for
trial. Charge (Exh.5) was framed against Appellants and read over and
explained to them in vernacular, to which both pleaded not guilty and
claimed to be tried.
To bring home the guilt of Appellants, prosecution examined
10 witnesses.

4.            PW-9 - Dr. Pralhad C. Padghane, conducted postmortem
examination on the dead body of Sakharam and prepared PM report
(Exh.40) which notified the following injuries:
1.      Deep and wide CLW looking like blunt object stab

4.1.          PW-9 in PM Report stated “the probable cause of death was
hemorrhagic shock due to multiple injuries to head and brain causing
internal, external profused bleeding and assault with hard protruding
object.” In his substantive evidence he has stated that “injuries at Sr.
No.1, 2, and 3 mentioned in col. No.17 and injuries mentioned in
col.no.19 are possible due to assault by a weapon like hammer. Other
injuries mentioned in col. No.17 are possible in scuffle.” In his cross
examination he has specifically stated that, “it is not true that all these
injuries can be caused if a vehicle gives a dash to a person and he falls
on a rough kachcha road having gitties and stones.”
5.            PW-2, Lakhma Ramu Ambolkar is the sole eye witness to the
incident. On 22.01.2011 he was returning from his daily labour job at
around 5:30 p.m. and Sakharam was ahead of him on his bicycle.
When they reached upto the boundary of village Vasa-Karajgaon, he
Corrected/modified Judgment as per speaking to the minutes of the Order dated 03.10.2022      6/17
Cri. Appeal.1032.15 and 1033.15(ii).doc
saw Appellants riding on motorcycle and they stopped and accosted
Sakharam on the road and assaulted him.                                     He has deposed that
Appellant No.2 held Sakharam from behind and Appellant No.1
removed a hammer from the carrier/boot of the motorcycle and
inflicted a blow on his head; further after Sakharam fell to the ground,
he was assaulted by kicks by Appellants; that people gathered at the
spot and therefore Appellants ran away on their motorcycle from the
spot. Prosecution has heavily relied upon the ocular evidence of PW-2.
6.            Mr. P.R. Arjunwadkar, learned Advocate appearing for
Appellants vehemently submitted that, prosecution has failed to prove
its case beyond reasonable doubt and there are material discrepancies
and lacunae in the Judgment passed by the learned Trial Court. He
submitted that there is no material brought on record to prove the
alleged love affair between deceased and daughter of Appellant No. 1
(Joystna) and hence motive is not proved by prosecution; that there is
no incriminating evidence proved against both Appellants to connect
them to the crime in question. He submitted that Appellants had no
enmity with Sakharam and are falsely implicated by prosecution.
Hence he has prayed for setting aside of the impugned Judgment and
7.            PER CONTRA, Mr. S.S. Hulke, learned APP, appearing on
behalf of State has drawn our attention to the deposition of PW- 2, eye

Cri. Appeal.1032.15 and 1033.15(ii).doc
witness, to incident and submitted that he witnessed the assault by
Appellants; that ocular evidence of PW-2 stands corroborated by
medical evidence given by PW-9 pertaining to injuries sustained by
Sakharam. He submitted that PW-1 in his evidence has deposed that
Sakharam was having a love affair with daughter of Appellant No.1
(Jyostna) which was not disliked by Appellants and their family
members; that Appellant No.2, had some months prior to incident
assaulted Sakharam and threatened to kill him if he continued his
alliance with Jyostna and thus the motive was proven. He has
therefore prayed for dismissal of Appeal.
8.            We have heard both the learned advocates appearing for
respective parties and with their able assistance perused the entire
evidence and record of the case.
It is seen that prosecution case is substantially based on
ocular evidence, theory of “motive” and recovery of weapon. In the
present case there is a sole eyewitness to the incident.
9.            It is pertinent to note that PW-2 is the eye witness who has
witnessed the entire incident from a distance of 30 feet, hence he can
be classified as a wholly reliable witness based on his testimony which
is not shattered in cross-examination; that he is also not an interested
witness; his testimony is corroborated by Medical evidence given by
PW-9 and the inquest and recovery panchanama conducted by PW-10.
Corrected/modified Judgment as per speaking to the minutes of the Order dated 03.10.2022      8/17
Cri. Appeal.1032.15 and 1033.15(ii).doc
10.           From perusal of the record of the case it is discernible that
testimony of PW-2 is reliable and therefore needs to be accepted
without any doubt. His testimony narrates the entire incident as
observed by him in close proximity and it stands further corroborated
by recovery evidence (Exh.29 and Exh.35A) and medical evidence
11.           That apart, on minute perusal of the deposition of the PW-1,
it is seen that Appellants had a clear motive to harm Sakharam, as he
continued his love affair with Joystana (daughter of Appellant No.1),
which was not approved by Appellants and their family.                                      Further
Appellant No. 2’s conduct of assaulting Sakharam a few months before
the incident and threatening to kill him if he continued to meet
Joystna proves motive for eliminating Sakharam, is one of the strong
circumstance indicating motive behind the crime.
12.           However in the context of reappreciation of evidence in the
present case, it will be apposite to refer to the provisions of Sections
299 and 300 IPC which define offences of culpable homicide and
murder respectively and read thus:
“299. Culpable homicide.—Whoever causes death by
doing an act with the intention of causing death, or with
the intention of causing such bodily injury as is likely to
cause death, or with the knowledge that he is likely by
such act to cause death, commits the offence of culpable
homicide.
Explanation 1.—A person who causes bodily injury to an-
other who is labouring under a disorder, disease or bodily
Corrected/modified Judgment as per speaking to the minutes of the Order dated 03.10.2022      9/17
Cri. Appeal.1032.15 and 1033.15(ii).doc
infirmity, and thereby accelerates the death of that other,
shall be deemed to have caused his death.
Explanation 2.—Where death is caused by bodily injury,
the person who causes such bodily injury shall be deemed
to have caused the death, although by resorting to proper
remedies and skillful treatment the death might have been
prevented.
Explanation 3.—The causing of the death of a child in the
mother's womb is not homicide. But it may amount to
culpable homicide to cause the death of a living child, if
any part of that child has been brought forth, though the
child may not have breathed or been completely born.
300. Murder.— Except in the cases hereinafter excepted,
culpable homicide is murder, if the act by which the death
is caused is done with the intention of causing death, or—
2ndly.—If it is done with the intention of causing such
bodily injury as the offender knows to be likely to cause
the death of the person to whom the harm is caused, or—
3rdly.—If it is done with the intention of causing bodily
injury to any person and the bodily injury intended to be
inflicted is sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to
4thly.—If the person committing the act knows that it is
so imminently dangerous that it must, in all probability,
cause death, or such bodily injury as is likely to cause
death, and commits such act without any excuse for
incurring the risk of causing death or such injury as
aforesaid.
Exception 1.—When culpable homicide is not murder.—
Culpable homicide is not murder if the offender, whilst
deprived of the power of self-control by grave and sudden
provocation, causes the death of the person who gave the
provocation or causes the death of any other person by
mistake or accident.
The above exception is subject to the following provisos:
—First.—That the provocation is not sought or voluntarily
provoked by the offender as an excuse for killing or doing
harm to any person.
Secondly.—That the provocation is not given by anything
done in obedience to the law, or by a public servant in the
lawful exercise of the powers of such public servant.
Thirdly.—That the provocation is not given by anything
done in the lawful exercise of the right of private defence.
Corrected/modified Judgment as per speaking to the minutes of the Order dated 03.10.2022      10/17
Cri. Appeal.1032.15 and 1033.15(ii).doc
Explanation.—Whether the provocation was grave and
sudden enough to prevent the offence from amounting to
murder is a question of fact.
Exception 2.—Culpable homicide is not murder if the of-
fender in the exercise in good faith of the right of private
defence of person or property, exceeds the power given to
him by law and causes the death of the person against
whom he is exercising such right of defence without pre-
meditation, and without any intention of doing more
harm than is necessary for the purpose of such defence.
Exception 3.—Culpable homicide is not murder if the of-
fender, being a public servant or aiding a public servant
acting for the advancement of public justice, exceeds the
powers given to him by law, and causes death by doing an
act which he, in good faith, believes to be lawful and nec-
essary for the due discharge of his duty as such public ser-
vant and without ill-will towards the person whose death
is caused.
Exception 4.—Culpable homicide is not murder if it is
committed without premeditation in a sudden fight in the
heat of passion upon a sudden quarrel and without the of-
fender's having taken undue advantage or acted in a cruel
or unusual manner.
Explanation.—It is immaterial in such cases which party
offers the provocation or commits the first assault.
Exception 5.—Culpable homicide is not murder when the
person whose death is caused, being above the age of
eighteen years, suffers death or takes the risk of death
with his own consent."
13.             Sections 302 and 304 IPC prescribe the punishment for the
offence of murder and that of culpable homicide not amounting to
murder respectively and read thus:
“302. Punishment for murder.—Whoever commits
murder shall be punished with death or 1[imprisonment
for life], and shall also be liable to fine.”
“304. Punishment for culpable homicide not amounting
to murder.—Whoever commits culpable homicide not
amounting to murder, shall be punished with
1[imprisonment for life], or imprisonment of either
description for a term which may extend to ten years, and
shall also be liable to fine, if the act by which the death is

Cri. Appeal.1032.15 and 1033.15(ii).doc
caused is done with the intention of causing death, or of
causing such bodily injury as is likely to cause death;
or with imprisonment of either description for a
term which may extend to ten years, or with fine, or with
both, if the act is done with the knowledge that it is likely
to cause death, but without any intention to cause death,
or to cause such bodily injury as is likely to cause death.”
[emphasis supplied]”
14.           In the present case Trial Court has convicted and sentenced
Appellants for the offence of murder (as defined in Section 300 IPC)
15.           Exception 4 to Section 300 IPC outlines a situation where
culpable homicide does not amount to murder. There are three
requirements for this exception to apply:
(i)     the act of killing is committed without premeditation;
(ii) the act of killing is committed in a sudden fight in the
heat of passion upon a sudden quarrel; and
(iii) the offender should not have taken undue advantage or
acted in a cruel or unusual manner.
16.           Keeping in mind the aforementioned statutory provisions, on
minute perusal of the evidence and record of the present case, it is
discernible that Appellant No.1's daughter (Jyostna) had a love affair
with Sakharam which was not accepted by his family. It has come on
record that both Jyostna (19 years) and Sakharam (21 years) were of
tender age and belonged to different castes and hence their alliance
Corrected/modified Judgment as per speaking to the minutes of the Order dated 03.10.2022      12/17
Cri. Appeal.1032.15 and 1033.15(ii).doc
was not accepted by Appellants’ family. From the deposition of PW-1,
it is seen that Appellant No.1 had visited Sakharam’s house and
informed his family that he will not give Joystna’s hand to Sakharam
and they should find some other bride for him. It is also important to
note that few months prior tot he incident, Appellant No.2 had also
confronted Sakharam at Umargaon and threatened to kill him if he
continued his lover affair with Jyostna.
17.           From the above mentioned two incidents, it can be evidently
seen that Appellants were against their relationship and did everything
possible to break the same. This clearly shows that Appellants were
enraged with Sakharam as the affair was continuing. In this backdrop,
on 22.01.2011 Appellant Nos. 1 and 2 while traveling on their
motorcycle saw Sakharam on Karajgaon road ahead of them and
accosted him to question him as to why he was still continuing his love
affair with Jyostna and abused him profusely. A physical scuffle broke
out and it is clearly seen from the evidence of PW-2 that Sakharam
hands and body from behind and Appellant No. 1 in the heat of
passion removed the carpenter’s hammer from the carrier/boot of his
motorcycle and gave a singular blow on Sakharam’s forehead and he
fell to the ground. Since bystanders including PW-2 gathered at the
spot, Appellants ran away on their motorcycle. It is pertinent to note
that Appellant No. 1 was a carpenter by profession and it is therefore
Corrected/modified Judgment as per speaking to the minutes of the Order dated 03.10.2022      13/17
Cri. Appeal.1032.15 and 1033.15(ii).doc
not unusual on his part to carry a hammer and other equipment
related to carpentry in the boot of his motorcycle. Therefore, in view
of the provisions of Exception 4 to Section 300, in our opinion, the act
of inflicting a singular blow with the hammer on Sakharam’s forehead
by Appellant No. 1 can be said to have been inflicted in a heat of
passion and on the spur of the moment due to the motive, but
certainly cannot be a premeditated and planned act to murder him.
We say so for the following reasons.
18.           The act of killing Sakharam happened on the road when he
was accosted by Appellants. Certainly this cannot be a premeditated
and planned act. Further because of the relationship between
Sakharam and Jyostna Appellants were enraged with Sakharam for
having continued his alliance with Jyostna and this was the very
reason for confronting Sakharam. The weapon used by Appellant was
the hammer which was not carried in the first instance by Appellant
No. 1 before assaulting Sakharam. It has come in evidence that after
the confrontation with Sakharam, Appellant No. 2 overpowered and
hled him, there were abuses and kick blows given to him and
thereafter Appellant No. 1 reached to his motorcycle took out the
hammer (which is the carpenter’s principal tool) from the boot of his
motorcycle and inflicted its singular blow on Sakharam’s forehead.
After inflicting the singular blow, Appellants did not take any undue
advantage or act in a cruel or unusual manner but were frightened
Corrected/modified Judgment as per speaking to the minutes of the Order dated 03.10.2022      14/17
Cri. Appeal.1032.15 and 1033.15(ii).doc
since bystanders gathered at the spot. Hence they left the spot on
their motorcycle.            Further at the behest and instance of Appellant
No.1, the weapon (hammer) and the motorcycle was recovered and
seized by the IO. Hence it is discernible that it could not have been the
intention of Appellants to kill and murder Sakharam but certainly both
Appellants wanted to teach him a lesson and reprimand him for
continuing with the said alliance. The injury caused to Sakharam by
blow of hammer was however fatal leading to his death.
19.           The discussion and findings alluded to hereinabove, in our
considered opinion pertaining to act of the Appellants does not travel
beyond the offence of culpable homicide not amounting to murder in
the facts and circumstances of the present case. Act of Appellants due
to the motive proved by the prosecution was an act committed in the
heat of passion and on the sudden spur of moment whereby the
singular blow of hammer was inflicted by Appellant No. 1 on
Sakharam’s forehead. The Trial Court has therefore certainly erred in
convicting and sentencing the Appellants for offence punishable under
Section 302 IPC when the Appellants deserve to be given the benefit of
doubt. The act of the Appellants’ falls within the ambit of punishment
for culpable homicide not amounting to murder prescribed under Part-
II of Section 304 IPC.
19.1.         It is seen that in so far as Accused No.2 i.e. Appellant in
Corrected/modified Judgment as per speaking to the minutes of the Order dated 03.10.2022      15/17
Cri. Appeal.1032.15 and 1033.15(ii).doc
Criminal Appeal No.1032 of 2015 is concerned his role is clearly and
admittedly attributed to holding deceased Sakharam’s hands behind
his back and thereby abetting in the crime. It has come in evidence
that Laxman D. Dandekar (Accused No.1) and Sachin Laxman
Dandekar (Accused No.2) were both distinctly unhappy with
Sakharam’s affair with Jyotsna and therefore the present incident as
seen was a result of the said animosity. Appellant No.1 was arrested
on 22.01.2011 and since then is incarcerated.                                In so far as Appellant
No.2 is concerned, he was arrested on 23.01.2011 and was granted
bail during the pendency of his Appeal on 27.12.2016. He has already
undergone the sentence of 5 years, 11 months and 4 days as of today.
However considering the totality of circumstances and taking into
consideration the role of Accused No.2, we are inclined to sentence
Accused No.2 for the period already undergone in jail by him.
20.           In view of the above discussion and findings, we are of the
firm opinion that Appellants acted in a sudden spur of the moment
and heat of passion. By such act they acted in a manner that, they
knew is likely to cause death of Sakharam but without the intention to
kill him.
(i)     The conviction of the Appellants in both Criminal
Appeal under Section 302 IPC is set aside; instead
Corrected/modified Judgment as per speaking to the minutes of the Order dated 03.10.2022      16/17
Cri. Appeal.1032.15 and 1033.15(ii).doc
Appellants are convicted under Section 304 Part-II IPC
and sentenced to suffer rigorous imprisonment for 10
years and to pay a fine of Rs. 25,000/- each, and in
default thereof to suffer further rigorous imprisonment
(ii) Accused No.1 i.e. Appellant in Criminal Appeal
No.1033 of 2015 was arrested on 22.01.2011. Since he
has undergone the sentence awarded hereinabove, he
shall be released from prison forthwith unless required
in any other case/cases.
Criminal Appeal No.1032 of 2015 is concerned he is
sentenced to the period he has already undergone in
jail. Since he is already enlarged on bail, his bail bond
stands cancelled.
22.                  Both Criminal Appeals are partly allowed in the aforesaid
terms.
