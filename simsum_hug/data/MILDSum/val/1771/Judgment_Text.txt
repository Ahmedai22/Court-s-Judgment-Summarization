                                      Case :- APPLICATION U/S 482 No. - 434 of 2023
                                      Applicant :- Chandrapal
                                      Opposite Party :- State Of U.P. And 4 Others
                                      Counsel for Applicant :- Hardev Prajapati
                                      Counsel for Opposite Party :- G.A.
                                      Heard Shri Hardev Prajapati, learned counsel for the applicant
                                      and learned A.G.A. Perused the record.
                                      It is contended by learned counsel for the applicant that
                                      respondent nos.3, 4 and 5 are the accused of Special Session
                                      Trial No.183 of 2015 (State vs. Jay Prakash and others) u/s 436,
                                      395, 397 I.P.C., P.S.-Qadar Chowk, District Budaun. It is further
                                      contended by learned counsel for the applicant that respondent
                                      nos.3, 4 and 5 are the police personnel, who are being accused,
                                      but they are not co-operating with the trial.
                                      It is shocking to see that non bailable warrants were issued
                                      against the respondent nos.3, 4 and 5 for the first time way back
                                      on 20.7.2016 and now we are in January, 2023 but after lapse of
                                      even six years, learned Additional District Judge/Special
                                      Court/D.A.A., Badaun was unable to get the non bailable
                                      warrants executed against police personnel. Indeed it is a
                                      shocking state of affairs. The police personnel are not above the
                                      law and the application of law and legal provisions should be
                                      one and same for all and no special treatment shall be given to
                                      any person depending upon his position, power and place in the
                                      society.
                                      Under these circumstances, learned Additional District
                                      Judge/Special Court/D.A.A., Badaun is required to give written
                                      explanation as to why order dated 20.7.2016 issuing non
                                      bailable warrants has not been complied with till date.
                                      Let this matter be come on the board once again on 01.2.2023
                                      as fresh.
                                      By that time this Court expects that if there is no other legal
                                      impediment, the learned Additional District Judge/Special
                                      Court/D.A.A., Badaun shall execute his own non bailable
                                      warrants against the respondent no.3, 4 and 5 and give a report
                                      to this effect by the next date fixed.
                                      Let this order may be handed over to the learned A.G.A. for
                                      communication and compliance.
