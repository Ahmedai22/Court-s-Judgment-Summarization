Counsel for Appellant :- Brij Bhushan Paul, Manvendra Singh
Counsel for Respondent :- Govt. Advocate
1.    Heard Sri Manvendra Singh, learned counsel for the appellant
and Sri Vikas Goswami, learned Counsel for the State.
2.    This appeal has been preferred against the judgment and order
dated 06.02.2002, passed by the learned Additional District and
Sessions Judge (Fast Track Court No.2), Fatehpur, in Session Trail
No.121 of 1997 (State of UP vs. Javed) under Section 302 IPC,
whereby the appellant was convicted and sentenced for the offence
under Section 302 IPC for life imprisonment with a fine of Rs.5,000/-
and in to further go three years rigorous imprisonment.
3.    Accused Javed has been convicted by the trial court for
commission of offence under Section 302 IPC. During the pendency of
this appeal, he was enlarged on bail as he spent six years in jail.
Recently on his non appearing before the Court, Javed was arrested and
he has been lodged in jail since 23.09.2019 in compliance of the order
dated 13.09.2019. Though during pendency of this appeal, he requested
for recalling that order. After 15.10.2019, the Office never listed this
matter. It is only after Hon'ble the Chief Justice directed to list all bail
matters that this has been listed.
4.    The brief facts of the case given rise to this appeal are that a first
information report was lodged at Police Station Kotwali, District
Fatehpur on 04.11.1996 on the basis of written report submitted by the
informant Mohd. Maksood Khan. The averments of FIR are that on
04.11.1996, a lady relative of the informant came to his house and
made some inquiry with regard to the divorce of Rafat. There was some
altercation with the accused Javed and he was scolded by his father,
mother and relative. During this altercation, Javed uttered bad words
regarding Quran Sharif. Father of the informant told that a person who
does not believe in Quran is called Kafir (person who has no respect
for religion). Javed threatened the father of the informant. The
informant and his father were going to their house at about 02 P.M. and
when they reached in front of the shop of J.K. Tailors, Javed came there
with country-made pistol and fired at the father of the informant who
fell there. Javed ran away intimidating the informant. Informant took
his father to the hospital but he died on the way.
5.     The FIR which culminated into charge-sheet. The charge-sheet
was submitted under Section 302 IPC read with Sections 504 and 506
IPC for the offence alleged to have been committed on 04.11.1996. The
accused on being summoned from the jail, did not accept the charges
and wanted to be tried.
6.     To bring home the charges, following witnesses were examined
by the prosecution:
7.     Apart from oral evidence, following documentary evidence were
produced by prosecution and proved by leading the evidence:
5.      Recovery-memo of earth and EC           Ex. Ka17
6.      Postmortem report                       Ex. Ka2
11.     Site-plan of case u/s 302 IPC           Ex. Ka16
12.     Site-plan of case u/s 25 Arms Act       Ex. Ka13
8.     Accused-appellant was examined under Section 313 Cr.P.C. and
evidence led by prosecution against him, was put to him. Accused
stated that false evidence has been led against him and no witness was
examined by him in defence.
9.     Learned counsel for the appellant submitted that appellant has
been falsely implicated in this case. The motive alleged in the FIR is
false and it is fabricated to strengthen the prosecution case only. He is
innocent. It is vehemently submitted by learned counsel that P.W.1 is
son of the deceased and P.W.2 is wife of the deceased. Both are related
and interested witnesses. No independent witness is produced by the
prosecution. It is next submitted by learned counsel that accused was
not arrested on the spot. With regard to the recovery of country-made
pistol from the possession of the appellant, learned counsel submitted
that the recovery of country-made pistol is planted. No recovery is
made from the possession of the appellant. It is further submitted that
no independent witness of recovery is produced before the trial court.
Learned trial court has not appreciated the evidence on record in right
10.    In alternative, learned counsel for the appellant made prayer that
keeping in view the peculiar circumstance of this case, if prosecution is
believed then also the offence of the appellant does not fall under
Section 302 IPC and it cannot travel beyond the scope of Section 304
(Part-I) of IPC because the fire was opened by the appellant on sudden
and grave provocation on the part of the deceased. There was no pre-
meditation in the        crime and the appellant was provoked by the
deceased by calling him Kafir which was the matter of religion and
only a single fire was made by the appellant.
11.    Per contra, learned AGA submitted that appellant is named in
FIR as single accused. It is next submitted that the FIR is lodged
promptly without delay and there was no reason with the informant to
implicate the accused falsely. Learned AGA further submitted that
appellant is the single accused in this case and no person would
implicate any person falsely while leaving the real assailant scot free.
There is no previous enmity between informant and the appellant,
hence informant had no reason for false implication. Learned AGA
further submitted that weapon used in the crime is recovered on the
pointing out of the appellant. Hence, learned trial court has not
committed any error in convicting the appellant.
12.    It is correct to say that P.W.1 is the son of the deceased and P.W.2
is the wife of the deceased. They are related witnesses but testimony of
related/interested witness cannot be brushed aside only on that ground
but their evidence should be scrutinized very carefully and cautiously
and if after careful scrutiny of the evidence of the interested or related
witness, it is found cogent, credible and trustworthy. Court can safely
act upon it.
13.    Medical evidence is on record in the form of post-mortem report.
Following ante-mortem injuries are shown in the post-mortem report.
(1) Multiple (more than 15) pellet injuries in an area of 17X11 c.m. of
chest above nipple, some cavity deep, some muscle deep and some skin
deep. Blackening and tattooing was present.
(2) Lacerated wound size 4X3 c.m. on the base of right thumb. Pellet
marks on small and ring finger of right hand. Thumb was fractured.
14.   Above ante-mortem injuries shown in the post-mortem report,
corroborate the version of P.W.1 and P.W.2 that the appellant fired on
the chest of the deceased. Hence, there is discrepancy between ocular
and medical evidence.
15.   The finding of fact regarding the presence of witnesses at the
spot of occurrence cannot be faulted with. Death of the deceased was a
homicidal death. Hence, we have no doubt on the findings recorded by
learned trial court holding the appellant guilty. We are of the considered
view that the appellant was rightly convicted by learned trial court but
we differ with the trial court in convicting the appellant under Section
302 IPC. Peculiar facts and circumstance of this case take us to
consider the vexed issue as to whether the offence committed by the
appellant, falls within the purview of Section 302 IPC or Section 304 of
IPC. It would be relevant to refer Section 299 of the IPC which reads as
"299.Culpable Homicide-Whoever causes death by doing an act
with the intention of causing death, or with the intention of
causing such bodily injury as is likely to cause death, or with the
knowledge that he is likely by such act to cause death, commits
the offence of culpable homicide."
16.   The academic distinction between 'murder' and 'culpable
homicide not amounting to murder' has always vexed the Courts. The
confusion is caused, if Courts losing sight of the true scope and
meaning of the terms used by the legislature in these sections, allow
themselves to be drawn into minute abstractions. The safest way of
approach to the interpretation and application of these provisions seems
to be to keep in focus the keywords used in the various clauses of
Sections 299 and 300 IPC. The following comparative table will be
helpful in appreciating the points of distinction between the two
A person commits culpable Subject                to      certain
homicide if the act by which the exceptions,           culpable
death is caused is done.            homicide is murder is the
act by which the death is
(a) with the intention of causing (1) with the intention of
death; or                           causing death; or
(b) with the intention of causing (2) with the intention of
such bodily injury as is likely to causing such bodily injury
cause death; or                     as the offender knows to
(c) with the knowledge that the (4) with the knowledge
act is likely to cause death.       that the act is so
immediately      dangerous
17.   We have no doubt in our mind that the son in his haste and fury
as he was called Kafir (meaning thereby the person who does not
believe in religion) by father, got infuriated and in that haste, fire one
gunshot. The case would fall within Section 304 Part I though the
incident occurred later on provocation was in the first incident which
had taken place as narrated in the FIR. We held the accused guilty for
commission of offence as the local-made firearm was also recovered at
his behest from the place which was only known to him.
18.    In that view of the matter, we concur with the learned counsel for
the appellant to reduce the sentence. The incident had occurred because
of his father calling him a Kafir cannot be said that it was a
premeditated murder. On the contrary, the learned judge has given
benefit of doubt to him as far as Section 25 of the Arms Act is
concerned but held him guilty in Section 302 IPC.
19.    On overall scrutiny of the facts and circumstances of the case
coupled with the opinion of the medical officer and considering the
principle laid down by the Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of Tuka
Ram and others vs. State of Maharashtra [(2011) 4 SCC 250] and in
the case of BN Kavadakar and another vs. State of Karnataka [1994
Supp (1) 304], we are of the considered opinion that the offence would
be punishable under Section 304 (Part-I) IPC.
20.    From the upshot of the aforesaid discussions it appears that the
death caused by the accused persons was not pre-meditated. Hence the
instant case falls under the exceptions (1) and (4) to Section 300 of IPC.
While considering Section 299 IPC, offence committed will fall under
21.    The alternative prayer made by the learned counsel for appellant
is accepted. The accused-appellant is held guilty under Section 304
(Part-I) of IPC. In our view, sentence of seven years rigorous
imprisonment would serve the ends of justice. The appeal is liable to be
allowed in part. Appellant is held guilty for commission of the offence
under Section 304 (Part-I) IPC instead of offence under Section 302
22.    Hence, the conviction and sentence awarded to the appellant for
the offence under Section 302 IPC is converted into the offence under
Section 304 (Part-I) IPC and appellant is sentenced for seven years
rigorous imprisonment and fine of Rs.5,000/-. The appellant shall
undergo further simple imprisonment for three months in case of
default of fine.
23.   Accordingly, the appeal is partly allowed, as modified above.
