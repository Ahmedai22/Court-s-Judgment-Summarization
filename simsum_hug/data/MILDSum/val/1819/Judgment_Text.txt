This case is referred to our Hon’ble High Court
under Section 113 read with Order XLVI Rule 1 of
the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, to consider the
following aspects:
1) To declare sub-sections (2) and (3) of Section 23-
A of the Karnataka          Civil Courts Act, 1964
[inserted vide Karnataka Civil Courts (Second
28/1978 with effect from 1/2/1979)], are ultra
vires the Constitution of India.
2) To consider if the Notification bearing No. GOB
460/78     issued   by   our  Hon’ble  High  Court,
published in the Gazette on 29-03-1979, clothes
the powers of a District Judge under the Indian
Succession Act, 1925, upon Senior Civil Judges or
Civil Judges in the State of Karnataka, in respect
of    issuance    of   Probates   and   Letters  of
Administration, in view of the divergent views
expressed in the decisions of co-ordinate benches
of our Hon’ble High Court.”
2.     Brief    facts     of the case   are,   one
Smt.Boppanda Boji Kalappa executed her Will on
May 3, 1995. First respondent filed an application
in P & SC No.2/1996 on the file of learned Principal
District Judge, Kodagu, Madikeri under Section 276
of the Indian Succession Act, 19951, for grant of
Probate. Upon being contested, probate petition
was converted as O.S. No.1/1997.
3.     On December 11, 2003, the suit was
transferred to the Court of Civil Judge, Senior
Division, Kodagu on the ground of valuation and it
was re-numbered as O.S. No.3/2004.
4.     On February 28, 2006, as per the order
passed by the learned District Judge, the case was
again transferred to the Court of District Judge,
Madikeri and re-numbered as O.S. No.7/2006.
‘Indian Succession Act’ for short
5.     By order dated February 2, 2013, the
suit was again transferred to the Court of Senior
Civil Judge, Madikeri, in view of Notification No.
GOB        460/78         issued    by  this  Court    under
Section 23-A of the Karnataka Civil Courts Act,
19642 and the suit was re-numbered as                   O.S.
was decreed by the learned Senior Civil Judge,
Madikeri holding that the Will was proved in favour
of first respondent. Feeling aggrieved, the first
defendant in the suit filed R.A. No.11/2017 in the
Court of First Additional District Judge, Kodagu,
7.     It    was     contended on   behalf  of  the
appellant before the learned District Judge that the
Court of Senior Civil Judge did not have jurisdiction
‘Civil Courts Act’ for short
to issue the Probate of the Will because, as per
Notification No.GOB 460/78, the Civil Judges and
Senior Civil Judges had jurisdiction to adjudicate
upon the cases relating to issuance of Succession
Certificates.  Therefore,  in   matters   relating  to
issuance of Probate the jurisdiction vested with the
8.    It was contended on behalf of the first
respondent that under Section 23-A of the Civil
Courts Act, the High Court is empowered to invest
all or any powers of the District Judge under the
Indian     Succession     Act.    The     amendment
incorporating Section 23-A in the Civil Courts Act
had received the accent        of  the  President   on
November 22, 1978. By the Notification No. GOB
560/1978, all Civil Judges and Senior Civil Judges
were invested with the powers of the District Judge.
9.     Before     the     learned      District    Judge,
following authorities were cited:
• B.R. Jayanthi Vs. Radhamma and others3
wherein, the challenge to the jurisdiction of
Civil Judge on a transferred Probate Petition
was negatived;
• B.R. Jayanthi Vs. Radhamma and others4
wherein,      this     Court     had     relegated    the
appellants therein to file an appeal before the
learned District Judge in view of Section 23-A
of the Act and the Notification issued by this
Ltd., and others5 wherein, the decision in
ILR 2008 KAR 4612 was followed.
10.    In view of the above, the learned District
Judge       framed       following       questions      for    his
1) Whether sub-sections (2) and (3) of Section 23-A
of the Karnataka Civil Courts Act, 1964 [inserted
vide    Karnataka      Civil   Courts    {Second
RFA No.1324/2012 decided on 13.12.2012.
W.P. No.39334/2015 decided on 23.09.2015
28/1978 with effect from 1/2/1979)], are ultra
vires the Constitution of India?
2) Whether the Notification bearing No. GOB 460/78
issued   by our Hon’ble High Court, published in
the Gazette on    29-03-1979, clothes the powers
of a District Judge under the Indian Succession
Act, 1925, upon Senior Civil Judges or Civil
Judges in the State of Karnataka, in respect of
issuance     of   Probates     and   Letters   of
and answered the first question in the affirmative
and    held     that    the     second     question    requires
consideration in view of divergent views expressed
by this Court.
11.    Shri.     A.V.     Gangadharappa,         learned
Advocate for the appellant submitted that under
Section 276 of the Indian Succession Act, 1925, an
application for Probate has to be filed before the
learned District Judge and it was rightly filed by the
first respondent at the first instance. However, in
view of the Notification dated March 12, 1979, the
suit was transferred to the Court of the learned
Senior Civil Judge, Madikeri and the same has been
decreed. Placing reliance on Mrs. Joyce Enet Ugare
Vs. James I. P. Roche6,            he submitted that the
power to invest jurisdiction in any inferior Courts in
grade to the Court of District Judge is only in
relation to proceedings for issue of Succession
Certificate provided under Part-X of the Indian
Succession Act.         Therefore, the judgment and
decree passed by the learned Senior Civil Judge is a
nullity. Consequently, the appeal filed before the
learned District Judge is not maintainable and this
Court may direct the learned District Judge to
conduct the proceedings denova.
12.    In reply, Smt. Laksha Kalappa for the
respondents submitted that the Notification issued
in the year 1979 is under Section 23-A of the Civil
Courts Act.     By the said Notification, all powers of
the District Judge have been conferred upon the
M.F.A. No.3618/2010 decided on 19.06.2012 (para 8)
Civil Judges. Therefore, the judgment and decree
passed by the Senior Civil Judge is in accordance
with law. Consequently, the appeal is maintainable
before the learned District Judge.
13.     We       have     carefully        considered      the
Reference       order,     the    submissions          of    learned
Advocates on both sides and perused the records.
14.     Section 388 of the Indian Succession Act
reads as follows:
“388.   Investiture  of   inferior  courts   with
jurisdiction of District Court for purposes of this
Act.— (1) The State Government may by notification
in the Official Gazette, invest any court inferior in
grade to a District Judge with power to exercise the
functions of a District Judge under this Part. (2) Any
inferior court so invested shall, within the local limits
of its jurisdiction, have concurrent jurisdiction with
the District Judge in the exercise of all the powers
conferred by this Part upon the District Judge, and
the provisions of this Part relating to the District
Judge shall apply to such an inferior court as if it
were a District Judge: Provided that an appeal from
any such order of an inferior court as is mentioned in
sub-section (1) of section 384 shall lie to the District
Judge, and not to the High Court, and that the
District Judge may, if he thinks fit, by his order on
the appeal, make any such declaration and direction
as that sub-section authorises the High Court to
make by its order on an appeal from an order of a
District Judge. 94 (3) An order of a District Judge on
an appeal from an order of an inferior Court under
the last foregoing sub-section shall, subject to the
provisions as to reference to and revision by the
High Court and as to review of judgment of the Code
of Civil Procedure, 1908 (5 of 1908), as applied by
section 141 of that Code, be final. (4) The District
Judge may withdraw any proceedings under this Part
from an inferior court, and may either himself
dispose of them or transfer them to another such
court established within the local limits of the
jurisdiction of the District Judge and having authority
to dispose of the proceedings. (5) A notification
under sub-section (1) may specify any inferior court
specially or any class of such courts in any local
area. (6) Any Civil Court which for any of the
purposes of any enactment is subordinate to, or
subject to the control of, a District Judge shall, for
the purposes of this section, be deemed to be a
court inferior in grade to a District Judge.”
15.     Section 23-A of the Karnataka                   Civil
Courts Act, 1964 reads as follows:
“23-A. Investiture of subordinate Courts
with jurisdiction of District Court under the
(1) The High Court may, by notification, invest any
Senior Civil Judge or Civil Judge, within such local
limits and subject to such pecuniary and other
limitations as may be specified in such notification,
with all or any of the powers of a District Judge under
the Indian Succession Act, 1925 (Central Act 39 of
(2) Any Senior Civil Judge or Civil Judge invested
with    powers   under    sub-section  (1)   shall have
concurrent jurisdiction with the District Judge in the
exercise of the powers conferred by the said Act
upon the District Judge, and the provisions of the
said Act relating to the District Judge shall apply to
such Senior Civil Judge or Civil Judge, as the case
may be, as if he were the District Judge:
Provided that every order made by the Senior
Civil Judge or the Civil Judge by virtue of the powers
conferred upon him under sub-section (1) shall be
subject to appeal.–
(i) to the District Court, when the amount or value of
the subject matter is less than twenty thousand
(ii) To the High Court, in other cases.
(3) Every order of the District Judge passed on
appeal under the proviso to sub-section (2) shall be
subject to appeal to the High Court under the rules
contained in the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908,
applicable to appeals from appellate decrees.”
16.      Under Section 23-A of the Civil Courts
Act, the investiture of power is regulated by the
High Court. The reference made by the learned
District Judge has stemmed out of the divergent
views noted above.
17.  It is relevant to record that in Circular
No. R(J)5/2020 dated January 20, 2020, it has been
ordered that the Notification No. GOB 460/78 dated
March 12, 1979 has limited scope and invests the
power in Senior Civil Judges only for issuance of
Succession Certificates under Part-X of the Indian
Succession Act and not for Probate.
18.  Thus,    the   conflict  in   the   judicial
pronouncements has been resolved by the Circular
19.  Hence,    both   questions   referred   are
answered in the negative.
20.  Incidentally, it was also argued by Smt.
Laksha Kalappa that the learned District Judge be
directed to proceed further to hear the arguments
of the parties as evidence has been adduced and
the same is on record.
21.  Admittedly,     the   proceedings       were
initiated before the learned District Judge and it was
submitted at the Bar that some evidence has been
recorded in that Court. The evidence        recorded in
the proceedings before learned Senior Civil Judge is
without jurisdiction. Therefore, the same cannot
looked into. In view of the Circular dated January
20,   2020,   fresh   proceedings   will  have    to  be
conducted before the learned District Judge.
22.  In view of the above, the following:
(a)  Questions No. 1 and 2 referred by the
learned    District Judge     are  answered      in  the
(b)  Judgment and decree passed in O.S.
No.33/2013 on the file of the Senior Civil Judge is
set-aside and the said suit shall stand transferred to
the   Court  of  learned  Principal District  Judge,
(c)   The learned Principal District Judge or
the Additional District Judge to whom the file is
made over, shall commence fresh proceedings from
the stage of transfer of file from the Court of
District Judge to the Court of Senior Civil Judge,
Madikeri and complete the same as expeditiously as
