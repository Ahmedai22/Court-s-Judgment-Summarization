on 14.09.2021 took the victim girl to Athithi Comforts, Room
No.101 to have food and subjected her for sexual act as against
her wish, even though her marriage was already engaged with
some other person. After committing the said act, he promised
that he would marry her and not to disclose the same to anyone
and if she disclose the same to family members, he will take
away her life.
4.   Learned counsel appearing for the petitioner would
vehemently contend that the petitioner is working as Assistant
Executive Engineer in KPTCL and false case has been registered
against him since, he is a Government employee and there is a
delay of 1Â½ months in lodging the complaint.       The alleged
incident has taken place on 14.09.2021 and complaint was
lodged on 03.11.2021 and no prima facie case has been made
out against the petitioner and he has been in custody from

her for sexual act is not ruled out and hence, there is a prima

6.    Having heard the respective counsel and also on
perusal of the material available on record particularly, 164
statement of the victim girl, it is seen that, she has stated that
she was subjected to sexual act against her wish and also
caused life threat.  She has also stated that her marriage was
already engaged with other bridegroom and hence, after
committing the sexual Court, he promised that he would marry
and also caused life threat. Apart from that, medical evidence is
also clear that hymen was tear and opinion of the doctor is also
clear that, she was subjected to sexual act and material collected
not rules out subjecting her for sexual act. When such being the
material available on record, the fact that petitioner is a
Government employee is not a ground to enlarge him on bail,
when serious offence of rape is alleged against the petitioner.
Prima facie, the medical evidence as well as the 164 statement
disclose that the fact that victim was subjected to sexual act.
