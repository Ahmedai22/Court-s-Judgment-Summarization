(Judgment of the Court was delivered by S.SOUNTHAR, J.)
Aggrieved by an order dismissing the petition for divorce filed on
the ground of cruelty by appellant/husband the present appeal is filed.
2. The appellant/husband sought for divorce on the ground of cruelty
in H.M.O.P.No.604 of 2014, on the file of the Family Court, Erode. According
to him the marriage with the respondent took place on 10.11.2008. At the
time of marriage he was working as a Lecturer in Vivekanandha Medical
College and the respondent/wife was working as a Teacher in Government
School. They lived together for 2 and 1/2 years in the parental home of the
appellant and out of wedlock a female child Sreedhanya was born. According
to appellant, the respondent/wife developed suspicion about the appellant's
conduct and character and humiliated him by connecting him with his female
colleagues. A false complaint was preferred by respondent/wife against
appellant/husband before Thiruchengodu All Women Police Station, and the
same was marked as Ex.P.2 and thereafter on advise by the police both the
parties set up nucleus family in the first floor of appellant's parental home.
The appellant/husband also averred in his petition that the respondent/wife
with the evil intention of tarnishing the image of the appellant came to his
work place (college) and had spoken ill of him by connecting him with other
female lecturers.       The respondent/wife also said to have given another
complaint before Erode, All Women Police Station on 08.11.2011. On the
advise of the police, the appellant/husband set up a separate new matrimonial
home at Erode, but the respondent/wife made unreasonable demands and got
separated from appellant/husband without any reasonable cause. Hence,
according to appellant/husband they have been living separately from January
2011 onwards. The appellant also submitted that all his attempts for reunion
resulted in failure and hence he was constrained to file the above petition for
divorce on the ground of cruelty.
3. The respondent filed her counter statement wherein she admitted that
the appellant is working as a Professor in Thiruchengodu, Vivekanandha
Medical College and the respondent was working as a Teacher in Government
School. The respondent denied various allegations found in the petition for
divorce. The respondent specifically raised a plea that the petitioner was
having illegal intimacy with other working women and he used to talk with
them through cell phone till mid night. According to the respondent, the
petitions filed by her before police were only for reunion and she wanted to
live with the appellant having welfare of female child in her mind. She also
expressed her willingness to work as dutiful wife of the appellant and also
give respect to the elders of the appellant's family. On these pleadings she
sought for the dismissal of the divorce petition.
4. Before the Family Court, the appellant was examined as P.W.1 and
one Senthilkumar, colleague of the appellant working in the same college was
examined as P.W.2. The respondent was examined as R.W.1. On behalf of the
the appellant, Exs.P1 to P6 were marked and no document was marked on
behalf of the respondent.
5. The Family Court on consideration of the evidence available on
record, came to the conclusion that the appellant failed to prove cruelty
pleaded by him and dismissed the divorce petition and aggrieved by that the
above appeal is filed by the appellant/husband.
6. On the basis of the pleadings oral and documentary evidences, order
passed by the lower Court and contentions of the counsel for both the sides,
the following points are arising for consideration in this appeal.
"(i) Whether the appellant/husband proved his plea of
cruelty as a ground for divorce?
(ii) Whether the findings of the lower Court, on the basis
of the evidence available on record calls for any interference?"
Points No.(i) and (ii)
The learned Senior Counsel for the appellant submitted that the wife
suspected the character of the husband without any basis and lowered the
image of her husband, by visiting his work place and connecting him with
other female colleagues. He also submitted that the respondent/wife preferred
two complaints against appellant in different police stations and harassed
him. According to him these acts of respondent/wife will certainly constitute
mental cruelty within meaning of 13(i) (ia) of Hindu Marriage Act. In order
to substantiate his arguments he took us to the evidence of the P.W.1 and the
independent evidence of P.W.2 who happens to be the colleague of appellant /
husband. He also took us to the admissions of respondent/wife in her
pleadings and also in her evidence as R.W.1.            The learned counsel also
submitted that even according to the admission made by R.W.1, at the time of
the separation, she removed her thali and tossed it towards appellant/husband
as a token of her intention to put a full stop to the marital knot.
7. The learned Senior Counsel for the appellant relied on the following
decisions in support of his contention that the conduct of respondent/wife
would amount to mental cruelty.
"(1) K.Srinivas Rao Versus D.A.Deepa, reported in (2013) 5
(2) K.Srinivas Versus K.Sunita, reported in (2014) 16 Supreme Court
(3) Raj Talreja Versus Kavita Talreja, reported in 2017 (4) CTC 208;

(6) Dr.Anusha Versus Dr.Arjun, reported in 2017 (5) LW 165;
(7) Vallabhi Versus R.Rajasabhai, reported in 2017 (1) MWN (Civil)
8. The learned counsel for the respondent/wife submitted that the
respondent preferred complaint to police, only with a good intention of
seeking reunion and hence same cannot be termed as causing mental cruelty
to the husband. He took us to the evidence of R.W.1 and submitted that if the
evidence of R.W.1 is taken as a whole, her intention to live with her husband
is explicit and hence the appellant has not made out any case for granting
divorce. He also submitted that the appellant has not stated in his evidence
specifically the date in which respondent/wife alleged to have visited his
college and created scene there and hence the evidence of P.W.1 and P.W.2
with regard to the said fact cannot be accepted.
9. The appellant herein sought for divorce on the ground of cruelty. The
expression cruelty was very well explained by the Apex Court in a case law
A.Jayachandra versus Annel kaur, reported in (2005) 2 Supreme Court
Cases 22 . The relevant observations of the Apex Court explaining concept of
cruelty is as follows:
"10. The expression "cruelty" has not been defined in the
Act. Cruelty can be physical or mental. Cruelty which is ground
for dissolution of marriage may be defined as wilful and
unjustifiable conduct of such character as to cause danger to
life, limb or health, bodily or mental, or as to give rise to a
reasonable apprehension of such a danger. The question of
mental cruelty has to be considered in the light of the norms of
marital ties of the particular society to which the parties
belong, their social values, status, environment in which they
live. Cruelty, as noted above, includes mental cruelty, which
falls within the purview of a matrimonial wrong. Cruelty need
not be physical. If from the conduct of the spouse same is
established and/or an inference can be legitimately drawn that
the treatment of the spouse is such that it causes an
apprehension in the mind of the other spouse, about his or her
mental welfare then this conduct amounts to cruelty. In a
delicate human relationship like matrimony, one has to see the
probabilities of the case. The concept,proof beyond the shadow
of doubt, is to be applied to criminal trials and not to civil
matters and certainly not to matters of such delicate personal
relationship as those of husband and wife. Therefore, one has
to see what are the probabilities in a case and legal cruelty has
to be found out, not merely as a matter of fact, but as the effect
on the mind of the complaint spouse because of the acts or
omissions of the other. Cruelty may be physical or corporeal or
may be mental. In physical cruelty, there can be tangible and
direct evidence, but in the case of mental cruelty there may not
at the same time be direct evidence. In cases where there is no
direct evidence, courts are required to probe into the mental
process and mental effect of incidents that are brought out in
evidence. It is in this view that one has to consider the evidence
in matrimonial disputes.
11. The expression "Cruelty" has been used in relation to
human conduct or human behaviour. It is the conduct in
relation to or in respect of matrimonial duties and obligations.
Cruelty is a course or conduct of one, which adversely
affecting the other. The cruelty may by mental or physical,
intentional or unintentional. If it is physical, the court will have
no problem in determining it. It is a question of fact and
degree. If it is mental, the problem presents difficulties. First,
the enquiry must begin as to the nature of cruel treatment,
second the impact of such treatment in the mind of the spouse,
whether it caused reasonable apprehension that it would be
harmful or injurious to live with the other. Ultimately, it is a
matter of inference to be drawn by taking into account the
nature of the conduct and its effect on the complaining spouse.
However, there may be a case where the conduct complained of
itself is bad enough and per se unlawful or illegal. Then the
impact or injurious effect on the other spouse need not be
enquired into or considered. In such cases, the cruelty will be
established if the conduct itself is proved or admitted.(See
Shobha Rani V.Madhukar Reddi.)" (Emphasis supplied)
10. In the light of above observations of the Apex Court it is clear that
cruelty includes mental cruelty and it need not be physical. In some cases even
the very conduct complained of itself is sufficient to infer mental cruelty and
the impact of injury caused by said offending act of the other spouse need not
be enquired into or considered.
11. In the case on hand, in the divorce petition of the husband it was
specifically pleaded that wife suspected his character and she visited his work
place and created scene there by using filthy language and connecting the
appellant with other female teaching staff working with him, in the presence
of students and other colleagues in the college. Though, the respondent made
a general denial of the same in her counter, she made a specific plea in her
pleadings in paragraph 4 and the same is as follows:
"But the petitioner having illegal intimacy with other
working womens and he was speaking till the midnight is every
day night. The petitioner was beaten blue and black while she
made enquiry regarding cell phone conversation till midnight."
12. When the respondent was examined as R.W.1, she admitted that
she had given a complaint against the appellant/husband as he had illegal
relationship with another lady without naming her. She had specifically
admitted that she did not know the specific name of the lady with whom her
husband had illicit relationship. She further admitted that she went to the
college in which the appellant was working. She also admitted that husband
used to talk in cell phone and he had no other bad habits. The Vernacular
extract of the said admissions are as follows.

13. The appellant/husband was examined as P.W.1 and he deposed in
support of his pleadings in his divorce petition. In order to prove his
allegations that the respondent visited the appellant's work place and created
scene there, he examined his co-employee working in Vivekanandha Medical
College as P.W.2. He deposed that respondent came to college during the
second week of June, 2011 at about 04.30. P.M. and scolded the appellant
with filthy language in front of other teaching staffs and students. On going
through the admissions of the respondent in her pleadings and also in her oral
and documentary evidence, which was corroborated by the evidences of P.W.1
and P.W.2, we can safely infer that the respondent/wife visited the college in
which the appellant/husband was working and she created a scene there by
connecting the appellant with other female teaching staff in the presence of
other staff members and students. Certainly this act of the respondent would
amount to mental cruelty within the meaning of Section 13(1)(ia) of Hindu
Marriage Act as explained by the Apex Court in the case law A.Jayachandra
versus Annel kaur cited supra. We can also add that this act of respondent
would certainly cause serious, irreparable injury to the image of the appellant
in the minds of his colleagues and students.
14. The respondent herself admitted in her pleadings, as well as, oral
evidence that she had given a police complaint before All Women Police
Station, connecting the appellant with other women employees of the college
in which he was working without specifically naming anybody. Suspecting the
character of other spouse and making complaint to police would certainly
amount to mental cruelty, when it is not substantiated by any evidence. In the
case on hand, the respondent herself admitted that she did not know the name
of the lady with whom the appellant was allegedly having illegal intimacy. A
careful reading of the oral testimony of the respondent/wife makes it clear that
she assumed illegal intimacy only because appellant used to talk with his
female colleagues over cell phone. From the facts culled out above, there is no
difficulty for us to come to the conclusion, the doubt created in the mind of
respondent is nothing but an assumption without any reasonable basis. It
would be useful to refer to the observation of the Apex Court in a case law
Dr.Anusha Versus Dr.Arjun, reported in 2017 (5) LW 165 relied on by the
learned counsel for the appellant. The relevant observations are as follows:
"35.........The respondent  is  admittedly   holding    a
dignified post and such an incident in from his staff would have
caused untold mental agony and physical discomfort to him.
When the appellant herself admitted that such an incident had
taken place when she visited the office of the respondent, the
contention that none of the staff of the respondent were
examined to prove the incident does not arise. It is needless to
mention that facts which are admitted need not be proved by
the other side ..............................................................................
37.In the present case, admittedly, the appellant went to
the work place of the respondent and caused commotion and
chaos in the midst of the staff working with the respondent.
During the conversation, according to the respondent, the
appellant pulled his spectacles and when it had fallen on the
ground, she stamped it with her legs. Of course, such a
statement was denied by the appellant. However, the fact
remains that the appellant went to the work place of the
respondent on the relevant day and she also apoligised for
what has happened by way of an e-mail to the respondent. This
incident, undoubtedly, would have developed a deep scar in the
mind of the respondent. While that be so, we hold that the
respondent has established that he was subjected to cruelty at
the hands of the appellant."
15. It is appropriate to refer to the observations of the Apex Court in a
case law, K.Srinivas Rao Versus D.A.Deepa, reported in (2013) 5 Supreme
Court Cases 226, and the same is as follows:
"16...........Making  unfounded      indecent    defamatory
allegations against the spouse or his or her relatives in the
pleadings, filing of complaints or issuing notices or news items
which may have adverse impact on the business prospect or the
job of the spouse and filing repeated false complaints and cases
in the Court against the spouse would, in the facts of a case,
amount to causing mental cruelty to the other spouse"
16. The impact of baseless and reckless allegations about the extra
marital affair was explained by the Apex Court in a case law, Narendra
Versus K.Meens, reported in 2016 (6) CTC 440. The relevant observations of
the Apex Court is as follows:
"12........We have carefully gone through the evidence but
we could not find any reliable evidence to show that the
Appellant had an extra-marital affair with someone. Except for
the baseless and reckless allegations, there is not even the
slightest evidence that would suggest that there was something
like an affair of the Appellant with the maid named by the
respondent. We consider leveling of absolutely false allegations
and that too, with regard to an extra-marital life to be quite
serious and that can surely be a cause for mental cruelty."
17. In the light of the decisions referred above, we have no hesitation in
holding that in the present case, the respondent /wife caused mental cruelty to
husband by suspecting his character and making false allegations of extra
marital affair in the presence of his colleagues and students and also before the
police. We are given to understand that the appellant and the respondent are
living separately from 2011 onwards and there is no evidence available on
record to show that respondent has made any attempt for reunion during this
period.
18. Hence in the facts and circumstances of the case and also in view of
our finding that the respondent /wife by her act caused mental cruelty to the
husband, we propose to put a full stop to the marital tie by granting decree
dissolving the marriage between the petitioner and the respondent that took
19. When the respondent/wife was examined as R.W.1, she admitted
that at the time of separation, she removed her thali chain (Sacred chain worn
by wife as a token of having married). Though she proceeded to explain that
she retained thali and only removed the chain, the act of removing thali chain
had its own significance. The learned counsel for the respondent by taking us
to ceremonious for Hindu Marriage referring to Section 7 of Hindu Marriage
Act submitted that tying of thali is not a necessary one and hence removal of
thali by respondent, even assuming it was true, would not have any impact on
the marital tie. But, it is a matter of common knowledge that tying of thali is
an essential ritual in marriage ceremony that takes place in this part of the
world. It is useful to refer, the observations of a coordinate Bench of this
Court in Vallabhi Vs. R.Rajasabahi reported in 2017 (1) MWN (Civil) 128.
The Observations of the Division Bench of this Court is as follows:
"33. From the materials available on record, it is also
seen that the petitioner has removed the "Thali"(Mangalsutra)
and it is also her own admission that she has kept the same in
Banck locker. It is known fact that no Hindu married woman
would remove the "Thali" at any point of time during the
lifetime of her husband. "Thali" around the neck of a wife is a
sacred thing which symbolises the continuance of married life
and it is removed only after the death of Husband. Therefore,
the removal of "Thali" by the petitioner/wife can be said to be
an act which reflected Mental Cruelty of highest order as it
could have caused agony and hurted the sentiments of the
respondent."
20. The removal of thali chain is often treated as an unceremonious
act. We don't say for a moment that removal of thali chain per se sufficient to
put an end to the marital knot, but the said act of respondent is a piece of
evidence in drawing an inference about the intentions of the parties. The act
of respondent in removal of thali chain at the time of separation coupled with
various other evidences available on record, compel us to come to a definite
conclusion that the parties have no intention to reconcile and continue the
marital knot.
21. In the light of the above discussions the Civil Miscellaneous Appeal
is allowed and the fair and decreetal order passed by the Family Court, Erode
in H.M.O.P.No.604 of 2014 is set aside. The decree for divorce is granted in
favour of appellant/husband by dissolving the marriage that took place
between the appellant and the respondent on 10.11.2008. In the facts and
circumstances of the case there is no order as to costs.
