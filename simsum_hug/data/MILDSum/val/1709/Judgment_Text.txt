Present:     Mr. J.S. Toor, Addl. P.P. for U.T., Chandigarh.
The instant appeal has been preferred by the State of U.T.,
Chandigarh against the judgment dated 05.12.2019 passed by the Judge,
Special Court, Chandigarh in case baring FIR No.166 dated 18.07.2016
under Section 20 of the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act,
1985, registered at Police Station Mani Majra, Chandigarh.
In order to adjudicate the present case, the brief facts of the
case of prosecution are referred to hereby below:
(i)      That the case of the prosecution is that on 18.07.2016, Sub
Inspector Inder Singh alongwith other police officials was on
patrolling duty in front of Gate No.2, Shivalik Garden, Mani
Majra. At about 8.40 P.M., one person was coming from the Shanti
Nagar side on foot and on seeing the Police Party he turned back.
On suspicion that the said person might be carrying some stolen
article, they apprehended that person. Thereafter, he tried to throw
one tiffin which was being carried by him in his hand but he was
not allowed. After opening the same, it was found to be containing
Charas. SI Inder Singh requested public persons to join the
investigation, but none agreed to join the same. The said person
disclosed his name as Shankar and was unable to produce any
licence or permit for carrying the said contraband. SI Inder Singh
weighed the said contraband on Electronic Weighing Machine and
the weight came out to be 220 grams. Thereafter, SI Inder Singh
drew two samples of 10 gms each and sealed them in the separate
sealed parcels with the seal of CS at two places and the remnant
was also sealed in the sealed parcel with seal of CS at two places.
SI Inder Singh prepared the seizure memo and also filled the test
memo form. SI Inder Singh prepared ruka and sent it same through
Constable Rakeshwari Kumar to police station for registration of
the F.I.R. He also gave the information for sending the second I.O.
to the spot. After some time, second I.O. SI Rohit Kumar reached
the spot. SI Inder Singh handed over the case property as well as
accused to second I.O. vide memo. Second I.O. prepared the rough
site plan at his instance. Second I.O. arrested the accused vide
memo and conducted his personal search vide memo. On
completion of investigation, challan was put up in the court for
trial.
(ii)  On presentation of challan, copy thereof was supplied to the
accused free of costs.
(iii) A prima facie case under Section 20 of the Narcotic Drugs and
Psychotropic Substances Act (hereinafter referred to as the Act)
was made out against the accused, he was charge sheeted on
02.08.2017. Contents of the charge sheet were read over and
explained to the accused in simple Hindi to which he pleaded not
guilty and claimed trial.
(iv)     The prosecution in order to prove its case has examined as many as
seven witnesses.
The prosecution evidence was duly considered by the Judge,
Special Court, Chandigarh and upon consideration thereof, several
discrepancies in the evidence of the prosecution were noticed and it was
recorded that the prosecution has miserably failed to prove the offence in
question beyond a shadow of reasonable doubt and that the recovery itself
was suffering from suspicious circumstances. Furthermore, no independent
witness was joined to lend credence to the prosecution story. It was also
noticed that the testimonies of the police officials also suffered major
contradictions. The relevant parts of the observations recorded by the Judge,
Special Court, Chandigarh, are reproduced herein below:
“15. Further, if we go through the evidence of members of
patrolling party and the SHO, it is clear that the seal
was not properly used and there are material
discrepancies with regard to use of seal, which makes
the prosecution case highly doubtful. SI Inder Singh
has stated that samples were sealed with the seal of CS
but he has no knowledge whose seal it was through he
used the seal of CS after drawing it from his kit.
Further, he has stated that after use the seal CS was
handed over to HC Jaspal Singh PW2 but he has
denied this fact. Whereas PW5 SI Rohit Kumar who
was second I.O. has stated that after reaching the spot
he did not record the statement of first IO SI Inder
Singh but as per SI Inder Singh he got recorded his
statement from SI Rohit Kumar and further stated that
seal DR was affixed on the parcel of the contraband
and SI Rohit Kumar wrongly recorded that he affixed
seal of DR impression on the contraband whereas as
per I.O. Inder Singh the seal was of CS impression.
This creates a serious doubt because SI Inder Singh has
failed to give any explanation how he had stated in his
statement to SI Rohit Kumar that seal DR was used by
him while sealing the parcel of the sample as well as of
the remnant contraband. PW5 SI Rohit Kumar has
stated that seal CS belongs to SI Inder Singh but SI
Inder Singh had denied it and even he has failed to tell
if the seal CS was not belonging to him then to whom it
belongs to and how it came in his possession. Further,
the recording the statement of SI Inder Singh at the
spot by SI Rohit Kumar becomes highly doubtful
because the statement of SI Inder Singh shows that it
was recorded on 30.03.2015 and not on 18.08.2016.
Though SI Rohit Kumar had stated that he did not
record the statement of SI Inder Singh on 30.03.2016
but again he had failed to give any explanation then
how the date 30.03.2016 surfaced on the statement of
SI Inder Singh. Meaning thereby SI Rohit deposed
against the record, hence not given the true version.
Keeping in view the statement of both the material
witnesses i.e. PW5 and PW6 possibility of tempering of
the case property as well as sample cannot be ruled
out. Failure in the evidence by the witnesses to say
when the statement of first Investigating Officer was
recorded by the second I.O. and whether their seal CS
or DR was used by the first IO and more so it creates
suspicion whether after use the seal was handed over to
whom is a very serious bearing upon authenticity of the
prosecution case. Moreover, case of the prosecution is
that after completing the formalities at the spot accused
alongwith other documents was produced before the
SHO in the police station who after verifying the facts
affixed his seal on each parcel and prepared the sample
seal and handed over the same to PW3 HC Sakattar
Singh MMHC but HC Sakattar Singh has categorically
denied this fact stating that SHO did not hand over him
seal affixed by him. PW3 has also stated that he has no
knowledge to whom the seal CS belongs to. Possibility
of tempering of the case property as well as sample
cannot be ruled out. It is a technical offence and the
safeguards provided in the enactment requires a strict
compliance. Possibility of tempering of the case
property as well as sample cannot be ruled out.
Reliance can be laid in Vainkat Rao Vs. State of
Crl.LJ 2326 and State of HP Vs. Shadi Lal 2016
16. The case of the prosecution further becomes doubtful
because as PW6 SI Inder Singh and PW2 HC Jaspal
Singh, recovery memo of the contraband Ex.P2,
handing over memo of the contraband Ex.P3 and test
memo form Ex.P13 were prepared by the I.O. before
reaching the ruqqa carrier C.Rakeshwari at the spot
after lodging the FIR but perusal of the recovery memo
Ex.P2, test memo form Ex.P13 and the handing over
memo Ex.P3 reveals that FIR No.166 is already
mentioned there. The question arises if these documents
were prepared by the 1st I.O. at the time of
apprehending the accused and before sending C.
Rakeshwari for lodging FIR alongwith the ruqqa in
police station then how the FIR number was known to
Ist I.O. which he had mentioned on these documents.
This fact clearly demolish the very foundation of
prosecution case. Rather the argument of learned
defence counsel find force that prosecution has
concocted a fake story and all these documents were
prepared while sitting in the police station.
17. Further, PW7 Inspector Harminderjit Singh has stated
that he handed over the case property and sample seal
to MMHC on 18.07.2016 and seal to C. Rakeshwari but
C. Rakeshwari was not examined thus link evidence is
missing. PW7 Inspector Harminderjit Singh has stated
that SI Rohit Kumar has recorded his statement on
15.09.2016 but again said on 18.07.2016 but the
statement of Inspector Harminder Singh is of
30.07.2016. He has also no knowledge about the seal
impression of DR. This is material contradiction in the
statement of prosecution witnesses. PW2 HC Jaspal
Singh further deposed that he remained at the spot till
I.O..30PM whereas SI Rohit Kumr with whom HC
Jaspal Singh remained till completing the whole
proceedings at the spot and also associated him till the
police station when the recovered contraband as well
as the accused alongwith documents prepared at the
spot was produced before the police station, stated that
they remained at the spot till 12 O'clock but he also
stated that he reached in the police station at 11PM. It
again creates suspicion over the prosecution story that
if the second I.O. after completing the proceedings at
the spot reached in the police at 11PM then there was
no occasion for the police to remain present at the spot
upto 12 O'Clock.
18. Further, PW6 SI Inder Singh and PW2 HC Jaspal have
categorically stated that no independent witness was
joined in the investigation despite the fact that
occurrence    spot       was a  thoroughfare    and   the
availability of many persons were there on the spot at
time of occurrence. Police should have joined the
independent witness to lend credence to the prosecution
story because the testimony of the police witnesses
suffers from major contradictions. So in this situation
non joining of independent witnesses creates suspicion
over the prosecution story. Though it was stated by the
first I.O. and other police officials associated by him
that they tried to join some independent witness but
they refused to become witness. Their names were not
asked, police did not try to know about their names nor
any action was taken against them. Our Hon'ble High
Court in Amarjit Singh Vs. State of Haryana 2008 (3)
RCR (Criminal) 502 has held that if such person had
shown their unwillingness to join the investigation the
IO should have recorded a note to this effect in the case
diary and in absence of such the explanation given by
the police is not satisfactory. PW SI Inder Singh, SI
Rohit, HC Jaspal Singh were material witnesses but
their testimony is not of credit-worthy, reliable or
convincing hence does not create confidence in the
mind of Court.”
Upon consideration of the reasons mentioned by the Judge,
Special Court, Chandigarh, it is evident that all the crucial aspects have
been duly considered by the trial Court. The findings recorded by the Court
thus cannot be said to be perverse or unsustainable. Learned Addl. P.P. for
the U.T. Chandigarh could not indicate or refer to any evidence to show that
the    findings    recorded   in    the     impugned   judgment  suffer   from
misappreciation of evidence or is in defiance of settled position in law.
In view of the above, there is no ground warranting interference
in the impugned judgment passed by the Judge, Special Court, Chandigarh.
Accordingly, instant appeal stands dismissed.
