The petitioner was appointed B.T. Assistant (Maths) with effect from
09.01.2012 in the 6th respondent school against a vacancy arising out of
retirement of one Mrs.Vijaya Fathima Veronica as secondary grate teacher on
31.05.2011. The said teacher was working in the Upper Primary Sections of
Standards VI to VIII. The said post is a regular sanctioned post with grant-in-aid
from the Government. An application was made by the school to the fourth
respondent to convert the Secondary Grade Assistant post into B.T. Assistant
(Maths), on 01.06.2011. The fourth respondent, vide proceedings dated
16.12.2001, converted the post as per the request in terms of G.O.Ms.No.100,
School Education dated 27.06.2013. The petitioner was appointed as BT
Assistant (Maths) with effect from 09.01.2012.
2. Thereafter, a proposal was sent to the authorities for grant of
approval and approval was also accorded vide proceedings of the fourth
respondent dated 27.04.2012. The petitioner had also received salary and
allowances from the date of her appointment. However, an endorsement was
made that her approval was subject to the condition that the petitioner had to
complete Teachers Eligibility Test (TET) within five years.
3. Subsequently, the school was upgraded as High School and the
petitioner came to be absorbed as BT Assistant (Maths) in the upgraded school,
with effect from 01.10.2016. The absorption was also duly approved by the
fourth respondent. Thereafter, the petitioner also received yearly increments
from 01.01.2013 to 01.01.2016, duly in endorsed by the fifth respondent.
4. The petitioner had taken six months maternity leave from 21.01.2014
to 19.07.2014 for her second child and the leave was granted by the sixth
respondent management. The leave also was duly endorsed by the fifth
respondent. While the matter stood thus, all of a sudden, the third respondent
issued proceedings dated ...07.2017 for recovering of the amount paid by way
of annual increments and maternity leave salary. Being aggrieved by the order
seeking recovery, the petitioner is before this Court.
5. The learned Senior Counsel Father Xavier Arulraj appearing for the
petitioner would submit that the basis of the impugned order seeking recovery
of increments already granted to the petitioner was that the petitioner did not
qualify in Teachers Eligibility Test (TET) and therefore, not entitled to the
annual increments and also maternity leave benefits. According to the learned
Senior Counsel, the prescription of TET qualification in terms of the Right of
Children to        Free and Compulsory Education Act, 2009 was held to be not
applicable to minority institutions by a Constitution Bench of the Supreme
Court. The sixth respondent school being a minority institution and the
petitioner being employed in the said school, the impugned action of recovery
of increments and discontinuance of further grant of two annual increment
cannot therefore be countenanced in law.
6. According to the learned Senior Counsel, after the Constitution Bench
decision reported in Pramti Educational and Cultural Trust and Ors. vs.
Union of India and ors., (2014) 4 MLJ 486 (SC), several decisions have been
rendered by this Court holding that TET qualification cannot be made
applicable to the minority institutions. Similar challenge by the petitioners in
various writ petitions have been allowed by this Court, periodically.
7. The learned Senior counsel in this regard would refer to the recent
decision of this Court rendered in M.Jayaraj vs. Commissioner of School
Education, Chennai and ors. (W.P.No.23710 of 2021, dated 02.12.2021).
He would particularly draw reference to paragraphs 8 to 13. The said
paragraphs are extracted hereunder:
“8. The learned Senior counsel, Father Xavier Arulraj,
appearing for the petitioner, at the outset, would submit that
the issue of grant of annual increment from the date of
appointment of the petitioner is no more res integra as the same
has been covered by various decisions of this Court and
implemented by the educational authorities following the
Division Bench order passed in the aforementioned Writ Appeals.
The learned counsel would refer to the order passed by the
learned judge of this Court in W.P.(MD) No.20203 of 2020 dated
05.02.2020. The learned Judge , after referring to the Division
Bench judgement in 2016(5) CTC 639 has observed as under.
5. After the verdict of the Hon'ble Apex
Court, the Division Bench of this Court in the case
of Secretary to Government, Government of Tamil
Chennai Vs., S.Jeyalakshmi reported in (2016) 5 CTC
639 has held that the provisions of the RTE Act,
insofar as the minority Aided School are concerned,
are inapplicable and therefore, the Teachers
employed in such minority schools need not pass the
TET qualifications for being eligible for service and
monetary benefits. The said order of the Division
Bench has become final.
6. It is also stated by the learned counsel for
the    petitioner     that    the  respondents    have
implemented the requests made by similarly placed
Teachers of the minority institutions in some of the
cases. One such order passed by this Court, which
came to be implemented by the respondents is in
the case of Director of School Education and two
others    Vs.,   John    Wesley   and   others   dated
7.In view of the same, the impugned order
dated 20.08.2018 in O.Mu.No.1091/M1/2018 stands
quashed and consequently, the respondents are
directed to disburse the service and monetary
benefits and medical leave salary to one Lakshmi
within a period of eight weeks from the date of
receipt of a copy of this order.
8.Accordingly,     this  Writ  Petition  stands
allowed. No costs.
9. Another learned Judge of this Court vide order dated
29.04.2021 in W.P.(MD) No.8807 of 2021 following the earlier
orders has held as under.
8. In the present case, the petitioner's
appointment was approved by the first respondent,
vide proceedings, dated 06.08.2012 and passing in
Teachers Eligibility Test is not mandatory for the
Teacher appointed in the minority institution, as
per the judgment in Pramati Educational Cltural
Trust and others vs. Union of India reported in 2014
order, dated 25.03.2021 passed by the second
respondent is quashed. The third respondent is
directed   to   re-submit    the  proposal   to   the
respondents 1 & 2 within a period of two (2) weeks
from the date of receipt of a copy of this order. On
receipt of such proposal, the respondents 1 & 2 are
directed to consider the proposal of the third
respondent, for disbursing the yearly increments
and other monetary benefits to the petitioner with
effect from the date of appointment in the year
2012 and pass orders on merits and in accordance
with law, within a period of four weeks.
10. In the result, the Writ Petition is
allowed.    No    costs.  Consequently,    connected
Miscellaneous Petition is closed.
Further reference has been made to a recent decision of this
Court dated 26.08.2021 in W.P.Nos.17887, 17888 & 17891 of
2021 where yet another learned Judge of this Court following
the ruling of the Supreme Court in Pramati Educational Cultural
Trust and others vs. Union of India reported in 2014(8) SCC 1 has
allowed the writ petition as under.
petitions are allowed. The 3rd respondent is
directed to pass appropriate orders by approving
the   service   of  the  petitioner  together   with
monetary benefits within a period of six weeks from
the date of receipt of a copy of this order. No
costs.   Consequently,    connected    Miscellaneous
10. The learned Senior Counsel would therefore, submit
that the issue is no more open to contest and in all the cases,
the Government has accepted the decision and implemented the
orders by grant of annual increment. Therefore, he would
implore this Court to grant the prayer for issuance of Mandamus.
11.    The   learned   Additional   Government    Pleader
Mr.V.Manoharan, appearing for the respondents on instruction
would submit that the matter is covered as contended by the
learned Senior Counsel and he would have nothing further to add
on behalf of the official respondents.
12. In view of the above factual narrative and also
several orders passed by this Court subsequent to the ruling of
the Division Bench of this Court reported in 2016(7) MLJ 155
(Secretary to Government, Government of Tamilnadu, Education
Department vs. S.Jeyalakshmi), this Court has no hesitation in
allowing the present writ petition as well. It is not in dispute
that the issue is fully covered by the earlier rulings of this Court
as aforementioned and extracted supra          and therefore, this
Court has to necessarily hold that the petitioner herein has
made out a case for grant of relief.
13. In the above circumstances, the Writ Petition is
allowed and the 3rd respondent is directed to implement the
regularisation of service of the petitioner with all service and
monetary benefits from the date of his appointment in terms of
the legal principle laid down by the Hon'ble Division Bench of
this  Court   reported     in 2016(7)   MLJ    155   (Secretary   to
Government, Government of Tamilnadu Education Department
vs. Jeyalakshmi). The 3rd respondent is directed to pass
appropriate orders in this regard within a period of eight weeks
from the date of receipt of a copy of this order. No costs.
Consequently, connected miscellaneous petition is closed.”
8. The learned Senior counsel therefore would submit that the issue is no
more res integra and the impugned order is liable to be interfered with.
9. On behalf of the respondents 1 to 5, Mr.L.S.M.Hasan Fizal, learned
Additional Government Pleader appeared. The learned Additional Government
Pleader would not dispute the settled legal position. He would also not
seriously dispute the submissions made on behalf of the petitioner as to the
validity of the impugned order passed by the authorities.
10. In consideration of the above factual narrative, this Court has to
come to an inevitable consideration that the impugned action of the third
respondent is patently illegal and unconstitutional and cannot be sustained in
law. The above decision of this Court, following the earlier legal precedent on
the subject-matter, would be squarely applicable to the present case as well.
In the said circumstances, this Court has no hesitation to allow the writ
petition filed by the petitioner herein.
11. According to the impugned proceedings dated ..07.2017 in
Na.Ka.No.1964/AA2/2017, the third respondent is hereby set aside and the
official respondents are consequently directed to grant appropriate annual
increments that are otherwise admissible to the petitioner.
12. It is also clarified that if any recovery was effected as a consequence
of the impugned order, the same being held illegal herein. The recovered
amounts shall be refunded to the petitioner forthwith.
13. The competent authorities are directed to pass appropriate orders in
this regard within a period of four weeks from the date of receipt of a copy of
this order.
14. In the result, the writ petition is allowed. There will be no order as
to costs. Consequently, WMP Nos.36233 to 36235 of 2017 are closed.
