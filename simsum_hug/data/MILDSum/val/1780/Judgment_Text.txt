1.    This civil contempt petition has been filed, alleging non-
compliance of the judgment and order dated 28.04.2008 whereby
and whereunder, following directions were issued in favour of the
“Consequently, the writ petition stands allowed.
Respondents are directed to allow the petitioner to
join service as Female Health Worker in pursuance of
order Ann.3 dated 8th July, 2000 within one month
and consequential benefits flowing thereof be paid to
her within three months. No order as to costs”
2.    Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that when the
aforesaid directions were not complied with, the petitioner filed
S.B. Civil Contempt Petition No.618/2008 and during the course of
said contempt petition, the respondents allowed the petitioner to
join services on the post of Woman Health Worker w.e.f.
08.05.2008,     pursuant       to     her       appointment        order     dated
08.07.2000. At that point of time, respondents assured to extend
the consequential benefits to the petitioner as well within a period
of six weeks and therefore, the contempt petition was disposed of
vide order dated 19.08.2011 with liberty to file fresh contempt
petition, if new cause of action arises.
3.    Learned    counsel     for    the      petitioner        submits  that   the
respondents did not adhere to their assurance and remained fail to
grant the consequential benefits to petitioner, therefore against
part of non-compliance of the judgment dated 28.04.2008, this
contempt petition has been filed.
4.     The respondents have filed reply to the contempt petition,
alleging inter alia that consequential benefits pursuant to the
appointment to the petitioner have also been granted vide order
dated 25.10.2011, copy of which has been placed on record as
5.    Learned counsel for the respondents submits that since there
is no specific directions in the judgment dated 28.04.2008 to pay
the back wages and actual monetary benefits to the petitioner, the
petitioner has been given benefit on notional basis from July, 2000
to May, 2008 and an amount of Rs.26,746/- has been found
payable to the petitioner vide order dated 17.08.2011. The
respondents have offered this amount to the petitioner by way of
cheque No.431993 dated 25.10.2011, but the petitioner refused
to accept the same contending that this is a part payment of back
wages, whereas she is entitled for full back wages w.e.f. the date
of   her   initial appointment           i.e.     08.07.2000       onwards.     The
respondents have placed on record the order dated 17.08.2011 as
also the copy of cheque with the letter of refusal by the petitioner
to receive the cheque. Thus, the counsel for the respondents
submits that the judgment dated 28.04.2008 has been complied
with   and   there   is   no    deliberate          defiance    on   the   part   of
respondents. As such the proceedings of contempt petition be
6.    The petitioner has filed rejoinder, alleging inter alia that the
consequential benefits include the payment of actual monetary
benefits of back wages and therefore, though the petitioner has
been allowed to join services in pursuance to the appointment
order dated 08.07.2000 but she is also entitled to get all the back
wages from the date of her appointment. Therefore, according to
the petitioner, the respondents are guilty of non-compliance of the
part of judgment dated 28.04.2008 due to not granting the back
wages and actual monetary benefits by awarding only notional
benefits. To buttress his submissions, learned counsel for the
petitioner has placed reliance upon the judgment of Hon’ble
Supreme Court passed in the case of Commissioner Karnataka
Housing Board Versus C Muddaiah reported in [2007 (7)
SCC 689]        wherein in para No.34 following principle has been
“We are conscious and mindful that even in
absence of statutory provision, normal rule is “no
work no pay”. In appropriate cases, however, a Court
of Law may, nay must, take into account all the facts
in their entirety and pass an appropriate order in
consonance with law. The Court, in a given case, may
hold that the person was willing to work but was
illegally and unlawfully not allowed to do so. The
Court may in the circumstances, direct the Authority
to grant him all benefits considering “as if he had
worked”. It, therefore, cannot be contended as an
absolute proposition of law that no direction of
payment of consequential benefits can be granted by
a Court of Law and if such directions are issued by a
Court, the Authority can ignore them even if they had
been finally confirmed by the Apex Court of the
country (as has been done in the present case). The
bald contention of the appellant-Board, therefore, has
no substance and must be rejected.”
7.    Heard counsel for both the parties.
8.    It is not in dispute that as far as directions to allow the
petitioner to join services as Female Health Worker had already
been complied with and further according to the respondents, the
consequential     benefits     flowing        pursuant          to the   order    of
appointment of petitioner dated 08.07.2000 have also been
accorded vide order dated 25.10.2011.
9.    A perusal of the order dated 25.10.2011 goes to show that
pay increment was given to petitioner for the period w.e.f.
01.07.2000 to 07.05.2008, though notionally and from the date of
joining of petitioner in service, actual monetary benefits have
been calculated as Rs.26,746/- and the same were offered to the
petitioner. According to respondents, the petitioner has not
rendered services during the aforesaid period, as such no actual
monetary benefits/back wages are required to be given therefore,
the   petitioner   is    not    entitled        to     claim    actual  monetary
benefits/back wages for such period during which she has not
rendered services and more so there are no clear directions in the
order dated 28.04.2008 to pay actual monetary benefits/back
wages to the petitioner w.e.f. 08.07.2000 onwards. In the order
dated 28.04.2008, no specific directions were given to pay the
actual monetary benefits. The respondents treated the term
“consequential benefits” to provide the notional benefits by giving
pay increment and seniority treating the appointment of petitioner
10.   It is well settled principle of law that if two interpretations
are possible, and if the action is not contumacious, a contempt
proceeding would not be maintainable. Reference of the judgment
passed by Hon’ble the Supreme Court in case of Ram Kishan
Versus Tarun Bajaj reported in (2014) 16 SCC 204 may be
given to substantiate the principle of law.
11.   The Hon’ble Supreme Court, in the case of Anil Ratan
Sarkar Versus Hirak Ghosh reported in [(2002) 4 SCC 21]
has opined that the powers under the Contempt of Court Act
should be exercised with utmost care and caution and that too
rather sparingly and in the larger interest of the society and for
proper administration of the justice delivery system in the country.
In    para  No.15     of    the      aforesaid         judgment   following
“15. It may also be noticed at this juncture that mere
disobedience of an order may not be sufficient to
amount to a "civil contempt" within the meaning of
Section 2(b) of the Act of 1971 the element of
willingness is an indispensable requirement to bring
home the charge within the meaning of the Act and
lastly, in the event two interpretations are possible
and the action of the alleged contemnor pertains to
one such interpretation—the act or acts cannot be
ascribed to be otherwise contumacious in nature. A
doubt in the matter as regards the wilful nature of the
conduct if raised, question of success in a contempt
petition would not arise.”
12.   The Division Bench of this Court in D.B. Civil Contempt
Petition No.1520/2019 titled as Smt. Lalita Sharma Versus
Dr. R. Venkeshwar & Ors. and other connected contempt
petitions decided on 20.12.2021 has observed that whether the
actual monetary benefits/back wages would be payable to the
petitioner from the date of promotion or from the earlier date is a
matter requires proper adjudication for which the petitioner should
avail appropriate remedy in law and fresh adjudication of disputed
issue is not permissible in the contempt proceeding.
13.   In case of Commissioner, Karnataka Housing Board (supra),
referred by counsel for petitioner, the writ petition was allowed by
the Single Judge of High Court with direction to the Board to re-
assign seniority of the petitioner therein and to grant other
consequential benefits to him. Since consequential benefits were
not extended to the petitioner, he filed contempt petition in
respect thereof but the same was dismissed. Thereafter, the
petitioner   filed a   substantive          petition       seeking payment     of
consequential benefits, arrears of salary claiming that she is
entitled for the same after allowing her writ petition regarding re-
assignment of her seniority and the prayer was made that the
Board may be directed to extend monetary benefits as per the
judgment rendered in her writ petition. In the subsequent fresh
writ petition, the Supreme Court considered the principle of law as
propounded in para No.34 reproduced herein above. Therefore, in
that case a fresh adjudication of the dispute was made for the
substantive and separate proceedings in the writ jurisdiction and
no such directions were issued in the proceedings of contempt.
Thus, the aforesaid principle of law propounded by Hon’ble the
Supreme Court is not applicable to the facts of the present case,
where the court is considering the proceedings in contempt
14.   In the opinion of this Court also, the claim of petitioner for
payment of actual monetary benefits/back wages for the period
during which she has not rendered services, is not liable to be
adjudicated in the contempt proceedings and non-payment of
such monetary benefits by the respondents to the petitioner, may
not be treated as non-compliance of the order dated 28.04.2008,
more particularly when there is no specific directions in explicit
terms to pay the actual monetary benefits/back wages to the
petitioner w.e.f. 08.07.2000 onwards. The respondents, while
considering the consequential benefits to the petitioner pursuant
to directions passed in the order dated 28.04.2008, have passed
an order in speaking terms dated 25.10.2011, giving pay
increment to the petitioner notionally and giving actual monetary
benefits for the period, after allowing joining to the petitioner in
service. The petitioner should have challenged the order dated
25.10.2011 by appropriate and separate proceedings in law, if she
was inclined to claim entitlement for the back wages/actual
monetary benefits for the period during which she did not
rendered services. After passing the order dated 25.10.2011, the
respondents    may   no    longer       be     alleged      defaulter  for   non-
compliance of the order dated 28.04.2008 and in that view of
matter, the respondents may not be held guilty for non-
compliance of the order dated 28.04.2008.
15.   Accordingly, the contempt petition does not survive any
further and is accordingly dismissed. Notices are discharged.
