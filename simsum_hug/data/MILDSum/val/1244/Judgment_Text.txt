1.     MEP Infrastructure Developers Limited (“MEPIDL”) is at
loggerheads with the Municipal Corporation of Delhi (“MCD”;
previously the South Delhi Municipal Corporation). The dispute is
about the recovery by the MCD of a large sum of money that it says
is due from MEPIDL. Writ Petition No. 10304 of 2022 is by
MEP Infrastructure Developers Ltd & Anr v South Delhi Municipal Corporation & Ors
MEPIDL (“the MEPIDL Petition”). Writ Petition No. 8677 of
2022 is by the MCD, (“the MCD Petition”).
2.     In the MEPIDL Petition, the prayers after amendment are

“A. This Hon’ble Court be pleased to direct the

B. This Hon’ble Court be pleased to direct the Respondent

Respondent No. 2 to take appropriate penal action against
the Respondent No. 3 for acting without the authority of
law in issuing and pre-empting the defaulter by way of the
notice dated 04.01.2022.”
4.     The MEPIDL Petition is against several Respondents, 12 in
all, including the MCD, its Commissioners, two banks and then,
importantly for our purposes, the District Magistrate at Chandivali,
Powai, the Tahsildar Executive Magistrate, Kalyan, the Tahsildar
Executive Magistrature at Kurla. Also joined as Respondents by an
amendment are the District Collector Mumbai Suburban and the
District Collector Thane. In the MCD Petition, the Respondents are
MEP Infrastructure Developers Ltd & Anr v South Delhi Municipal Corporation & Ors
apart from the State of Maharashtra, the District Collector at
Thane, one of the banks and MEPIDL.
5.     A compact statement of facts may be taken from the MCD
Petition. The MCD is a statutory body. Its governing statute is the
Amongst its various functions, the MCD collects toll tax from
commercial vehicles entering Delhi from as many as 1024 toll gates
or entry points around Delhi. This is said to be one of the principal
sources of revenue for all municipal corporations of Delhi.
6.     The MCD says that it does not itself have in-house manpower
to collect toll tax at these various collection points. It cannot
monitor the quite considerable daily cash collections. The work is
thus contracted out on a lumpsum basis to various third parties.
This is done under the Delhi Municipal (Toll Tax) Bye-Laws 2007,
which are to be read with Section 113 of the DMC Act.
7.     According to the MCD, MEPIDL, a Mumbai-based
enterprise, made a bid for collection of toll tax from all MCD toll
gates/check posts at the many entry points into Delhi. The parties
executed a contract on 28th September 2017. We note at the
forefront that we are not concerned in these Petitions with the
merits of the disputes arising from that contract. It is enough to note
that the contract required MEPIDL to make a specified weekly
remittance to the MCD. This was expressed also in terms of an
annual remittance and was subject to a periodic enhancement.
Other remittances were also to be made. According to MCD, an
MEP Infrastructure Developers Ltd & Anr v South Delhi Municipal Corporation & Ors
amount of about Rs. 100 crores was to be paid monthly towards toll
tax. The contract in question required MEPIDL to recover other
charges such as environment compensation charges, and these too
had to be remitted to the MCD.
8.      MCD’s case is that MEPIDL failed to make these
remittances. A large amount fell due. The contract itself provided
for a penalty. MCD imposed that penalty. It also served several
demand notices amount by various communications from 3rd
November 2017 till 14th February 2021.
9.      There seemed to be no resolution to these disputes. MCD
terminated the contract by a notice dated 16th March 2020.
10.     The scene now shifts to MEPIDL’s dispute about the
termination and the MCD’s demands. This took place in the Delhi
High Court where MEPIDL filed a Writ Petition challenging the
termination. That was dismissed on 9th April 2021. We are told
there is a Letters Patent Appeal pending against that order. Again,
this is not our concern except to the limited extent to note that the
matter is squarely within the seisin of the Delhi High Court.
11.     On 10th April 2021, according to the MCD, MEPIDL was
indebted to the MCD in an amount of nearly Rs. 4,000/- crores. Mr
Joshi for MCD says that figure has gone up considerably since.
12.     The disputed question is this. MCD has set about recovering
its claim. MEPIDL is not a Delhi-based enterprise. It has no assets
MEP Infrastructure Developers Ltd & Anr v South Delhi Municipal Corporation & Ors
in Delhi. But it has considerable assets, both movable and
immovable, within the jurisdiction of this Court. MCD has also
moved in distraint and issued distress warrants. One of these was
sought to be challenged by MEPIDL before the Delhi High Court.
No stay was granted. MEPIDL says it has withdrawn that challenge
petition to the distress warrant, a statement that MCD disputes.
13.    This brings us now to the frame of the MEPIDL Petition
because what MCD did was to move against MEPIDL’s assets
within the jurisdiction of this Court. It did so by requesting, in the
manner that we will shortly describe, the local authorities to issue
notices of attachment of MEPIDL’s assets within this Court’s
jurisdiction. The request was for attachment of both movable and
immovable properties. The movable properties seem to be bank
accounts with one or the other of the Respondent banks. At least
one of these banks has been unusually friendly to MEPIDL: rather
than acting on the Tehsildar’s notice demanding a freezing of the
accounts, it invited MEPIDL to explain why that action should not
be taken.
14.    The argument by MEPIDL represented by Mr Dhond relates
principally to the two notices at Exhibits “A1” and “A2” to the
MEPIDL Petition. From the prayers that we have set out above, it is
clear that the relief is also sought in respect of the warrants of
distress. Mr Dhond clarifies that only one warrant of distress was
challenged before the Delhi High Court. Mr Joshi says that the
others have never been challenged elsewhere. In any case, Mr
Dhond also says that the challenge to the warrants of distress is to
MEP Infrastructure Developers Ltd & Anr v South Delhi Municipal Corporation & Ors
the extent that they seek to move against properties, both movable
and immovable, within the jurisdiction of this Court. He also states
that the challenge to a solitary warrant of distress filed before the
Delhi High Court has been withdrawn. This is disputed.
15.    We decline to enter into that controversy. For the reasons that
follow, we decline to embark on an adjudication of the warrants of
16.    Exhibits “A1” and “A2” are at pages 56 and 59 of the
MEPIDL Petition. Exhibit “A1” is dated 28th October 2021. This is
a communication from the Tahsildar and the Executive Magistrate
Kalyan to the Manager of the State Bank of India and the Manager
of the Dombivli Nagari Sahakari Bank Ltd to freeze two accounts
noted in that letter. Exhibit “A2” is of 16th November 2021. It notes
that there is a Revenue Recovery Certificate and says that if the
demand is not paid, the amount of the Revenue Recovery Certificate
will be recovered as arrears of land revenue under the Maharashtra
17.    Mr Dhond maintains that the Writ Petition squarely lies
within the jurisdiction of this Court. He invites attention to Article
226 (2) of the Constitution of India. We reproduce Article 226 of
“226. Power of High Courts to issue certain writs.—
(1)     Notwithstanding anything in Article 32 every High
Court shall have powers, throughout the territories in
relation to which it exercise jurisdiction, to issue to any
person or authority, including in appropriate cases, any
MEP Infrastructure Developers Ltd & Anr v South Delhi Municipal Corporation & Ors
Government, within those territories directions, orders or
writs, including writs in the nature of habeas corpus,
mandamus, prohibitions, quo warranto and certiorari, or
any of them, for the enforcement of any of the rights
conferred by Part III and for any other purpose.
(2) The power conferred by clause (1) to issue
directions, orders or writs to any Government, authority
or person may also be exercised by any High Court
exercising jurisdiction in relation to the territories
within which the cause of action, wholly or in part,
arises for the exercise of such power, notwithstanding
that the seat of such Government or authority or the
residence of such person is not within those territories.
(3)      Where any party against whom an interim order,
whether by way of injunction or stay or in any other
manner, is made on, or in any proceedings relating to, a
petition under clause (1), without—
(a)    furnishing to such party copies of such
petition and all documents in support of the plea for
such interim order; and
(b)    giving such party an opportunity of being
makes an application to the High Court for the
vacation of such order and furnishes a copy of such
application to the party in whose favour such order has been
made or the counsel of such party, the High Court shall
dispose of the application within a period of two weeks from
the date on which it is received or from the date on which
the copy of such application is so furnished, whichever is
later, or where the High Court is closed on the last day of
that period, before the expiry of the next day afterwards on
which the High Court is open; and if the application is not
so disposed of, the interim order shall, on the expiry of that
period, or, as the case may be, the expiry of the aid next day,
MEP Infrastructure Developers Ltd & Anr v South Delhi Municipal Corporation & Ors
(4)     The power conferred on a High Court by this article
shall not be in derogation of the power conferred on the
Supreme Court by clause (2) of article 32.”
(Emphasis added)
18.    It is true that the Respondent Tehsildar is within the
jurisdiction of this Court and that the properties in question, both
movable and immovable, are also within the jurisdiction of this
Court. According to Mr Dhond, since the action is brought against
those properties, it can safely be said that the cause of action, or at
least a part of it, arises within the jurisdiction of the Court. It makes
no difference that the demand on which the impugned action is
based originates from outside the jurisdiction of this Court.
19.    Mr Joshi for his part says that this is a misreading of Article
226(2). The entirety of Article 226 confers an equitable and a
discretionary power on the High Court to issue a high prerogative
writ remedy. Sub-article (2) was introduced by the 15th amendment
as Article 226(1-A) and then, by the 42nd Amendment, in its
present form. It allows High Courts to exercise their discretionary
jurisdiction even when the originating authority is beyond that High
Court’s jurisdiction. But this does not mean that in every case, a
High Court must exercise its jurisdiction, i.e., that the equitable
discretion is taken away. Article 226(2) is an expansion of a High
Court’s writ jurisdiction, not a fetter on it. Surely equitable
considerations must be a factor. It is his submission that there is
really no jurisdictional remit of this Court to be exercised under
Article 226(2). The act of the Tahsildar in issuing the impugned
MEP Infrastructure Developers Ltd & Anr v South Delhi Municipal Corporation & Ors
notices are purely ministerial acts, giving effect to a Revenue
Recovery Certificate and to the warrants of distress. Those warrants
were all issued in Delhi under a Delhi statute. No part of the cause
of action relatable to the warrants of distress arises within the
jurisdiction of this Court; and, therefore, there is no call for
interference with the impugned notices.
20.    Mr Joshi is at some pains to submit that we should not enter
into the merits of the case, i.e., the actual dispute as MCD’s claim
and MEPIDL’s liability. We agree it is not for us to decide whether
that debt is or is not due and whether the claim of the MCD is or is
not justified. There is no dispute that there are warrants of distress
and that these have been issued from Delhi.
21.    Jurisdictionally, the warrants of distress and the impugned
notices are distinct. The impugned notices are based on the
warrants of distress. The notices originate in this Court’s
jurisdiction. The warrants of distress do not. The fact that the
warrants of distress resulted in the impugned notices does not, in
and of itself mean that we should exercise our discretion in regard to
those distress warrants.
22.    Mr Dhond would next have it that unless it is shown that the
claim of the MCD is revenue, no revenue authority can purport to
exercise powers for recovery of the amount claimed as “arrears of
land revenue”. It is his case that this is a money claim, pure and
simple. At best it is a tax. It is in no sense, he submits, recoverable as
arrears of land revenue.
MEP Infrastructure Developers Ltd & Anr v South Delhi Municipal Corporation & Ors
23.   To understand the controversy, we must consider certain
provisions of the applicable statute. There is, first, the DMC Act.
There are also the Delhi Municipal Corporation (Toll Tax) Bye-
Laws 2007 (“the Toll Tax Bye-Laws”). The DMC Act has a
separate chapter on taxation, Chapter VIII. Section 113 sets out the
taxes to be imposed by the Corporation under the Act. The list
includes a tax on vehicles under sub-section (1). Under sub-section
2(g) of section 113, tolls are specifically enumerated as one species
of tax. Then sub-section (3) says that the taxes specified in sub-
sections (1) and (2) are to be assessed and collected in accordance
with the provisions of this Act and the Bye-Laws made thereunder.
24.   We turn to Sections 156, 157 and 158 of the DMC Act:
“156. Recovery of tax—
(1)      If the person liable for the payment of the tax
does not, within thirty days from the service of the
notice of demand, pay the amount due, such sum
together with all costs and the penalty provided for in
section 155, may be recovered under a warrant, issued in
the form set forth in the Eighth Schedule, by distress
and sale of the movable property or the attachment and
sale of the immovable property, of the defaulter:
Provided that the Commissioner shall not recover
any sum the liability for which has been remitted on appeal
under the provisions of this Act.
(2)      Every warrant issued under this section shall be
signed by the Commissioner.
(1)      It shall be lawful for any officer or other
employees of the Corporation to whom a warrant issued
MEP Infrastructure Developers Ltd & Anr v South Delhi Municipal Corporation & Ors
under section 156 is addressed to distrain, wherever it
may be found in any place in Delhi, any movable
property or any standing timber, growing crops or grass
belonging to the person therein named as defaulter, subject
to the following conditions, exceptions and exemptions,
(a)     the following property shall not be distrained:
(i)     the necessary wearing apparel and
bedding of the defaulter, his wife and
children and their cooking and eating
(ii)    tools of artisans;
(iv)    when the defaulter is an agriculturist
his implements of husbandry, seed,
necessary to enable the defaulter to
earn his livelihood;
(b)     the distress shall not be excessive, that is to
say, the property distrained shall be as nearly as
possible equal in value to the amount recoverable
under the warrant, and if any property has been
distrained which, in the opinion of the
Commissioner, should not have been distrained, it
shall forthwith be released.
(2)      The person charged with execution of a warrant of
distress shall forthwith make an inventory of the property
which he seizes under such warrant, and shall, at the same
time, give a written notice in the form set forth in the Ninth
Schedule, to the person in possession thereof at the time of
seizure that the said property will be sold as therein
mentioned.
MEP Infrastructure Developers Ltd & Anr v South Delhi Municipal Corporation & Ors
158. Disposal of distrained property and attachment
and sale of immovable property—
(1)      When the property seized is subject to speedy and
natural decay or when the expense of keeping it in custody
is, when added to the amount to the recovered, likely to
exceed its value, the Commissioner shall give notice to the
person in whose possession the property was at the time of
seizure that it will be sold at once, and shall sell it
accordingly by public auction unless the amount mentioned
in the warrant is forthwith paid.
(2)      If the warrant is not in the meantime suspended by
the Commissioner, or discharged, the property seized shall,
after the expiry of the period named in the notice served
under sub-section (2) of section 157, be sold by public
auction by order of the Commissioner.
(3) When a warrant is issued for the attachment and
sale of immovable property, the attachment shall be
made by an order prohibiting the defaulter from
transferring or charging the property in any way, and all
persons from taking any benefit from such transfer or
charge, and declaring that such property would be sold
unless the amount of tax due with all costs of recovery is
paid into the municipal office within fifteen days from
the date of the attachment.
(4) Such order shall be proclaimed at some place on
or adjacent to such property by beat of drum or other
customary mode and a copy of the order shall be affixed
on a conspicuous part of the property and upon a
conspicuous part of the municipal office and also, when
the property is land paying revenue to the Government,
in the office of the collector.
(5)      Any transfer of or charge on the property attached or
any interest therein made without written permission of the
Commissioner shall be void as against all claims of the
MEP Infrastructure Developers Ltd & Anr v South Delhi Municipal Corporation & Ors
Corporation enforceable under the attachment.
(6)     The surplus of the sale-proceeds, if any shall,
immediately after the sale of the property, be credited to the
Municipal Fund, and notice of such credit shall be given at
the same time to the person whose property has been sold
or his legal representative and if the same is claimed by
written application to the Commissioner within one year
from the date of the notice, a refund thereof shall be made
to such person or representative.
(7)     Any surplus not claimed within one year as aforesaid
shall be the property of the Corporation.
(8)     For every distraint and attachment made in
accordance with the foregoing provisions, a fee of such
amount not exceeding two and-a-half per cent. of the
amount of the tax due as shall in each case be fixed by the
Commissioner, shall be charged, and the said fee shall be
included in the costs of recovery.”
25.    Section 156(1) mentions recovery under a warrant issued in a
form set out in the Eighth Schedule by distress and sale of
immovable property or the attachment and sale of the immovable
property of the defaulter. Section 157(1) is a provision on which Mr
Dhond lays much emphasis. This speaks of a distraint. According to
Mr Dhond, therefore, Section 157(1) controls and limits Section
156(1): a distress warrant must be confined to property of the
descriptions set out in that sub-section and which is located in Delhi.
Then Section 158 deals with the disposal of property that is already
distrained and also deals with the attachment and sale of immovable
MEP Infrastructure Developers Ltd & Anr v South Delhi Municipal Corporation & Ors
26.    Mr Dhond’s submission does not commend itself to us.
Section 157 is an empowering provision. It only says that it is lawful
for an MCD employee who is in receipt of a warrant to distrain any
movable property or any standing timber growing crops or grass
subject to certain conditions exceptions and exemptions. It is not
possible we think, to read Section 157 as constraining the ambit,
amplitude and operation of Section 156 which does not contain any
such geographical limitation. Importantly, the Eighth Schedule
referred to in Section 156 also does not provide for any such
geographical restriction or limitation.
27.    Even otherwise, the submission cannot be accepted. For, if
what Mr Dhond says is correct then the result is, inevitably, absurd
and untenable. It means, one, that the MCD can never engage a
contractor from outside Delhi or who has no property in Delhi,
because then the MCD has no means of recovery. Two, that if the
MCD does engage a contractor from outside Delhi, i.e., one who has
no property in Delhi, then the MCD simply cannot proceed against
that property in recovery. Three, that a contractor from outside
Delhi who has no property in Delhi is more or less immunized from
any recovery. Four, the DMC has no viable recourse against such a
contractor. Five, that any attempt to recover against any property
outside Delhi is unlawful.
28.    Therefore, the submission also involves injecting a non-
existing word into Section 157(1): it means reading that section as:
“It shall ONLY be lawful for any officer or other employees
of the Corporation to whom a warrant issued under section
MEP Infrastructure Developers Ltd & Anr v South Delhi Municipal Corporation & Ors
29.     From any perspective, this is not a tenable manner to read the
statute. The phrase “shall be lawful” has two purposes. First, it is
clarificatory: it tells us what is permissible. Second, it introduces
important safeguards for the debtor in Section 157(1)(a)(i) to (iv)
and Section 157(1)(b). The domestic distraint, within Delhi, is
limited to movable property and standing crops, etc., and even this
“subject to the following conditions, exceptions and
exemptions, namely …”
And then follow the various provisions of sub-section (a)(i) to (a)(iv)
30.     Section 157(1) does not, therefore, control or limit Section 156
at all.
31.     The Toll Tax Bye-Laws are framed under the DMC Act. Bye-
Law 2(1)(c) defines Toll Tax to be the tax imposed on commercial
vehicles entering Delhi. Bye-Law 3 says the vehicles that are liable to
pay toll tax and the tax rates. Bye-Law 6 sets out the method of
collection of Toll Tax. Then there are provisions for penalty, closing
transactions at the end of the day and crediting daily proceeds of the
Toll Tax and so on.
32.     Next, we come to Section 455 of the DMC Act:
“455. Mode of recovery of certain dues— In any case
not expressly provided for in this Act or any bye-law
made thereunder any due to the Corporation on account
of any charge, costs, expenses, fees, rates or rent or on
any other account under this Act or any such bye-law
MEP Infrastructure Developers Ltd & Anr v South Delhi Municipal Corporation & Ors
may be recoverable from any person from whom such
sum is due as an arrear of tax under this Act:
Provided that no proceedings for the recovery of any
sum under this section shall be commenced after the expiry
of three years from the date on which such sum becomes
due.”
33.    Clearly, Section 455 must be read with Section 156 and the
Eighth Schedule. Therefore, it follows that an ‘arrear of tax’ can be
recovered in the manner set out in Section 156—
“by distress and sale of the movable property or the
attachment and sale of the immovable property…”
There is no geographical limitation in Section 455 or Section 156.
34.    Our attention is then invited to the provisions of the Revenue
Recovery Act 1890. Section 3(1) says that where there are arrears of
land revenue or a sum returnable as arrears of land revenue and the
amount is held by the defaulter against property in a district other
than that in which the arrears accrued or the sum is payable, the
Collector may send to the other collector of the other district, a
certificate stating the name of the defaulter and other particulars
and the amount that is payable. This, in other words, is the revenue
recovery certificate that led to the impugned notices. Section 3(3)
says that receiving Collector shall (the word is not “may”)), on
receiving the certificate, proceed to recover the amounts stated
therein as if it were an arrears of land revenue which had accrued in
his own District.
MEP Infrastructure Developers Ltd & Anr v South Delhi Municipal Corporation & Ors
35.    What this tells is that if an amount is recoverable as arrears of
land revenue in one district, that recovery may be effected in
another district by the issuance of a revenue recovery certificate. Mr
Dhond argues that the toll tax claimed by the MCD is not an arrear
of land revenue at all. It is, simply, a tax and it is recoverable as an
arrear of tax under the Act. So says Section 455, he submits, and
there is no way in which arrears of tax can be read to be arrears of
land revenue. But this argument divorces Section 455 from Section
156 and the Eighth Schedule entirely; and that, as we have noticed,
is untenable.
36.    Indeed, it is Mr Dhond’s submission that the MCD claim is
not even a tax but it is simply a contractual debt alleged to be
payable under a signed contract. What the MCD has therefore tried
to do, Mr Dhond submits, is to elevate a contractual debt first to the
level of a tax and then to the level of land revenue. Neither of these
subsequent stages, he submits, is permissible in law.
37.     We do not think it is possible to accept this submission. We
do not need to examine the contract or its termination or interpret
the contractual provisions. MEPIDL was collecting and remitting
toll. The question, therefore, is not whether MEPIDL was doing so
under contract but what is it that it was collecting and remitting
because it is this amount that is sought to be recovered. Toll is
undoubtedly a tax. It is so defined. The statute so says. Even the
Bye-laws make this abundantly clear. This completely answers the
first aspect of the matter; and there is no question of limiting the
recovery to a contractual debt. The second limb of the argument,
MEP Infrastructure Developers Ltd & Anr v South Delhi Municipal Corporation & Ors
that it is only a tax and not land revenue and cannot be recovered as
land revenue, to our mind unacceptably isolates Section 455 from
Section 156 and the corresponding Eighth Schedule. Section 455 has
two operative words. First, it speaks of a mode. Then it speaks of
“certain dues”. Section 455 is a sort of residuary provision. It applies
in any case not otherwise provided in the DMC Act or any Bye-law.
The ambit of Section 455 is to cover any charge, cost, expenses,
fees, rates, rent or any other account. Thus, even this goes against
Mr Dhond because any claim would, under Section 455, be “a
certain due” — including what Mr Dhond says is a mere contractual
claim. This too can be recovered as an arrear of tax. That takes us
directly to Section 156. Now that Section makes it abundantly clear
that the tax due can be recovered under an Eighth Schedule warrant
by distress and sale of movable property or the attachment and sale
of immovable property of the defaulter. There is no geographical
restriction in Section 156 limiting the action to assets in Delhi.
38.     This takes us to Mr Dhond’s submission that the Tehsildar
was required to “satisfy himself” before issuing either of the
impugned notices. We have understood this to mean that the
Tehsildar ought to have embarked on some sort of quasi-judicial
enquiry, perhaps even going into the question of statutory
interpretation and reconciling these provisions. We do not believe
this is correct at all. One reason is the Revenue Recovery Act. Once
the Tehsildar or the Collector has received the Revenue Recovery
Certificate, he necessarily had to act on it. Section 3(3) of the
Revenue Recovery Act is unambiguous in that regard. There is no
question of discretion in the hands of the Tehsildar.
MEP Infrastructure Developers Ltd & Anr v South Delhi Municipal Corporation & Ors
39.    Mr Joshi submits that toll is nothing but a form of land
revenue. It is a tax for the use of land, i.e., for the use of a road by a
vehicle. Land revenue is not defined in the Revenue Recovery Act.
We do not think it is necessary to pronounce finally on this aspect of
the matter in light of the view that we have taken that the action of
the officer is correct in accordance with law.
40.    There is a final reason not to accept Mr Dhond’s submission.
Cutting through all this jurisprudential argumentation, one thing
appears to us to be perfectly plain. Now that it has failed to get any
protection from the Delhi High Court, MEPIDL has set about
trying to stymie all recovery proceedings by assailing a ministerial
order and thus reducing even the proceedings in the Delhi High
Court to an idle formality. We are having none of it. At the very
least, the comity of Courts requires us to defer to the Delhi High
Court in this regard. It is not shown to us unequivocally that the
Tehsildar has acted illegally, unlawfully or in any manner that
warrants the exercise of our discretion in issuing a high prerogative
remedy. Merely because it is uncomfortable for MEPIDL is not a
ground to interfere. If this is a purely contractual dispute, as Mr
Dhond himself suggests it is, then MEPIDL’s remedies lie
elsewhere and not in our Writ Court.
41.    Reliance is sought to be placed on the decision of a learned
Single Judge, Badar Durrez Ahmad J as he then was, of the Delhi
High Court in Callipers Naigai Ltd & Ors v Government of NCT of
Delhi & Ors1 on the question of territoriality and jurisdiction. While
MEP Infrastructure Developers Ltd & Anr v South Delhi Municipal Corporation & Ors
we agree with the decision and judgment of the learned Single
Judge, we believe that the present case stands on a slightly different
footing. The point here is not whether this Court has jurisdiction,
especially territorial jurisdiction under Article 226(2) of the
Constitution of India, but whether that jurisdiction is required to be
exercised on the facts and in the circumstances of this case. As we
have noted, almost everything in this case militates against the
exercise of jurisdiction in favour of MEPIDL.
42.    Mr Joshi relies on the recent three-Judge bench decision of
the Supreme Court in Jalkal Vibhag Nagar Nigam & Ors v
Pradeshiya Industrial and Investment Corporation.2This discussed
inter alia the nature of levy under Section 52 of the UP Water
Supply and Sewerage Act, 1975. There was a dispute as to whether
the levy was a tax on land and buildings. The Supreme Court inter
alia observed that there has been a gradual obliteration of the
distinction between a tax and a fee at a conceptual level. It approved
the earlier authorities that there is no generic difference between a
tax and a fee, and held that the practical and constitutional
distinction between the two has eroded. A fee may also be a
compulsory exaction. It may also carry an element of compulsion.
The point that Mr Joshi makes is that it is not the label that one
attaches to it but it is the nature of the levy that is of relevance.
Jalkal Vibhag was distinguished in Kerala State Beverages
Manufacturing & Marketing Corporation Ltd v Assistant Commissioner
of Income Tax.3 The Revenue seems to have argued in Kerala State
Beverages that, following Jalkal Vibhag, there is no distinction at all,
MEP Infrastructure Developers Ltd & Anr v South Delhi Municipal Corporation & Ors
ever, between a fee and a tax. This argument was repelled. The
Supreme Court in Kerala State Beverages held that it is a settled
principle of interpretation that where the same statute uses different
terms and expressions, the legislature is referring to different things.
It also held that Jalkal Vibhag maintains and does not take away the
basic constitutional distinction between a ‘fee’ and a ‘tax’. Mr
Joshi’s point is that the statute defines toll as a tax. Merely because
it is collected under a contract will not change the nature of the levy,
or make it something other than a tax. MEPIDL was, plain and
simple, MCD’s tax collector. The amount in MEPIDL’s hands was
tax — by statute. It remained a tax, and this tax had to be remitted
to the MCD. It could not become ‘consideration’ or ‘damages’ or a
contractual debt of any other kind. This was always tax due to the
MCD. It was due from the drivers/owners of commercial vehicles
entering Delhi, and it was payable to the MCD. MEPIDL was only
‘harvesting’ the tax collections. It was a tax, and remains a tax, says
Mr Joshi; and Section 455 and 156 of the DMC Act show how this
can be recovered — i.e., against movable and immovable property
even outside Delhi. We believe this submission is perfectly correctly
43.     We see no reason, finally, to exercise our discretion at all in
regard to the several distress warrants that had been issued. It is
undoubtedly plain that MEPIDL had in fact challenged one such
distress warrant in Delhi. There may be a controversy about
whether it is withdrawn or not withdrawn but we do not see how
MEPIDL can literally take its chances in one High Court and then
try again in another High Court in this manner. The entire
trajectory of this is to be deprecated. When a principle challenge
MEP Infrastructure Developers Ltd & Anr v South Delhi Municipal Corporation & Ors
against the termination fails and while an appeal is pending, one
distress warrant is challenged in Delhi only to be allegedly later
withdrawn and other distress warrants are now brought before this
44.    These are reasons for us to refuse to exercise our Article 226
discretion which is after all undoubtedly equitable. Granting relief to
MEPIDL would, we believe, be entirely inequitable in the facts and
circumstances of the case.
45.    To put it a little colloquially and to put a lid on it, we made it
clear to Mr Dhond that in any such matter involving a matter of
commerce or even high commerce, it is now our almost invariable
practice to first ask that the amount be deposited. Mr Dhond is clear
that he is unable to do anything of the kind. If that be so, then to his
request that we grant him a writ, we must answer in the same coin,
that we too are unable to do anything of the kind.
46.    The MEPIDL Petition is dismissed.
47.    As to the MCD Petition, the challenge here is to a notice
issued by the Kalyan Janata Sahakari Bank on 4th January 2022 to
MEPIDL asking it to show cause why the account should not be
frozen. The action of the Bank is indefensible. The bank has no
authority in law to invite suggestions and objections from a defaulter
against whom there is a Revenue Recovery Certificate. Once the
Tahsildar has issued a notice to freeze the account, the bank must
MEP Infrastructure Developers Ltd & Anr v South Delhi Municipal Corporation & Ors
comply, and it is then for the defaulter to apply to a Court or an
authority to have that account released from freezing.
48.    Accordingly, in the MCD Petition we issue Rule, make it
returnable forthwith and make Rule absolute in terms of prayer
clauses (a) and (b). Prayer (c) is of course not seriously pressed by
49.    The Petitions are disposed of in these terms. Mr Joshi presses
for costs. We believe that he has quite enough to recover. There will
be no order as to costs.
50.    The Interim Applications are infructuous and are disposed of
51.    Mr Dhond seeks an extension of an earlier protection. To
grant that would be to undermine everything we have just said. The
application is refused.
