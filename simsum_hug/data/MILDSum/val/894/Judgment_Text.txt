1. The petitioner has approached this Court assailing the
correctness of the impugned order under Annexure-1 dated 7th
June, 2022 passed in CRP No.117 of 2019 by the learned Judge,
Family Court, Cuttack on the ground that restoration of the
application under Section 125 Cr.P.C. dismissed for non-
prosecution could not have been entertained since the court
cannot recall or review its order in view of Section 362 Cr.P.C.
2. As claimed by the petitioner, opposite party No.1 wife filed an
application under Section 125 Cr.P.C. in the Family Court
registered as CRP No.89 of 2015, however, since no steps were
taken repeatedly, it was dismissed for default, whereafter,
restoration thereof was applied through CRP No.117 of 2019 in
terms of Section 126 Cr.P.C. followed by a request to condone
the delay in terms of Section 5 of the Limitation Act later to which
the petitioner was summoned and on his appearance, he filed an
objection by claiming that a proceeding under Section 125 Cr.P.C.
cannot be restored to file and the court as is not vested with any
inherent power has become functus officio after passing of the
CRLMC No.1943 of 2022                                    Page 1 of 4
final order, hence, it cannot recall or review the dismissal order in
view of the bar envisaged in Section 362 Cr.P.C. However, the
learned Judge, Family Court, Cuttack entertained the application
for restoration and proceeded to hold that the question of
limitation to be decided at a later stage on receiving evidence
since it is a mixed question of fact and law. It is the said decision
of the Family Court vide order 7th June, 2022 is under challenge
at the behest of the petitioner.
3. Heard Mr. Devashis Panda, learned counsel for the petitioner
and Ms. Anima Ku. Dei, learned counsel for the opposite parties.
4. Mr. Panda, learned counsel for the petitioner cited a decision
in the case of Md. Yusuf T. Attarwala Vrs. Jumana Yusuf
T.Attarwala and Another MANU/WB/0128/1987: I (1988) DMC
442 to contend that the Family Court did not have the power to
restore the proceeding or entertain an application in that regard
since it had become functus officio after the final order of
dismissal. Ms. Dei, learned counsel for the opposite parties
however would submit that an action for maintenance is basically
in the nature of civil proceeding and in case of its dismissal for
default, the same can be restored to file and while contending so,
Ms. Dei refers to a decision in the case of Kehari Singh Vrs. The
State of U.P. and Smt. Rekha Singh (2005) CriLJ 2330.
5. The seminal question is whether the learned Family Court
could have received and entertained the application for
restoration of the proceeding under Section 125 Cr.P.C?
6. Admittedly, opposite party No.1 did not turn up, as a result of
which, the proceeding under Section 125 Cr.P.C. was dismissed
for default, whereafter, restoration was moved by her and it was
received and entertained by the Family Court which has been
challenged on the ground that there is no any provision in the Cr.
CRLMC No.1943 of 2022                                     Page 2 of 4
P.C. to restore the proceeding once dismissed for non-
prosecution. In Md. Yusuf T. Attarwala (supra), the Calcutta High
Court expressed a view that there is no jurisdiction to restore a
proceeding under Section 125 Cr.P.C. when it is dismissed for
default. However, the Allahabad High Court in Kehari Singh
(supra) was of the view that an application under Section 125
Cr.P.C. claiming maintenance cannot be termed as a complaint as
the definition of word ’complaint’ as occurring in Section 2(d)
Cr.P.C. cannot be borrowed. While referring to a decision of
Andhra Pradesh High Court in Abdul Wahed Vrs. Hafeeza Begum
and Others 1987 CriLJ 726, the Allahabad High Court in said
decision concluded that the maintenance proceeding can be
restored to file by recalling or setting aside the order of dismissal
for effective adjudication and its disposal on merit. In Kehari
Singh (supra), other citations in Shabihul Hasan Jafari Vrs. Zarin
Fatma (2000) CriLJ 3051 and Sk. Alauddin@ Alai Khan Vrs.
Khadiza Bibi @ Mst. Khodeja Khattun and Others (1991) CriLJ
2035 with similar view expressed with the conclusion that the
power of recall is implicit with the court dealing with such
applications for maintenance have been quoted with approval.
7. When a proceeding of maintenance is dismissed on account of
default and if it is claimed that the court lacks jurisdiction to
restore it in absence of any provision, how it could have been
dismissed for non-prosecution, again for having no provision in
the Cr.P.C. According to the Court since such is action is
predominantly civil in nature, the power to restore a proceeding
under Section 125 Cr. P.C. is inherent. An application for
maintenance is not a complaint as defined in Section 2(d) Cr.P.C.
so to hold that in the event of its dismissal for default, the bar
contained in Section 362 Cr. P.C. would be attracted. In the
decision of Kehari Singh (supra), it is observed that if there is any
CRLMC No.1943 of 2022                                     Page 3 of 4
lacuna in the statute, then a court is obliged to pass a judicial
order to give effect to the intent and purport of the law and
therefore, a proceeding under Section 125 Cr.P.C. even though
dismissed for non-appearance can still be restored. With due
respect, this Court is in disagreement with the decision of the
Calcutta High Court in Md. Yusuf T. Attarwala (supra). Even
though the proceeding is before the Family Court which is
essentially dealing with the claim of maintenance is having
authority to recall and restore a proceeding under Section 125
Cr.P.C. disposed of and dismissed due to non-appearance of the
applicant. It is reiterated that the power to restore in such
proceedings in absence of provision in Section 126 Cr.P.C. is
implicit as has been held in Kehari Singh (supra) supported by
other decisions with similar view. So, the Court is not persuaded
to accept the contention of Mr. Panda, learned counsel for the
petitioner on the point of maintainability vis-à-vis restoration of
the proceeding. As a corollary, the learned Family Court cannot
be said to have committed any error or illegality in entertaining
the restoration application moved by opposite party No.1 and
rightly received the same and proceeded further.
8. Accordingly, it is ordered.
9. In the result, CRLMC stands dismissed. In the circumstances,
however, there is no order as to cost.
