Seeking to quash the proceedings in C.C.No.62 of 2016 on the file of
the Special Court constituted u/s.43(1) of the Prevention of Money
Laundering Act, 2002 [Principal Sessions Judge], Chennai, the present
petition has been filed.
2. At the outset, it may be necessary to state that in a prosecution under
the Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002 [hereinafter referred to as the
‘PMLA’], there will invariably be two sets of accused viz., one in the
predicate offence and other in the prosecution launched by the Enforcement
Directorate. Therefore, in order to avoid confusion, we are referring to the
rank of the accused as set out in the impugned complaint in C.C.No.62 of
2016 that has been filed by the Enforcement Directorate.
Criminal Original Petition No.19880 of 2022
3. The minimum facts that are required for deciding this quash petition
3.1. One G.Srinivasan [A1] and R.Manoharan [A2] entered into a
criminal conspiracy to cheat M/s.Global Trade Finance Limited [hereinafter
referred to as "GTFL"], a subsidiary of Global Trust Bank, pursuant to which,
R.Manoharan [A2], in collusion with S.Arivarasu [A5], Manager of GTFL,
applied for a loan with fake documents. S.Arivarasu [A5] sanctioned a loan of
Rs.15 crores on 16.05.2008 to a shell company by name M/s.Bhagavthi
Textile Mills [in short "BTM"] purportedly owned by R.Manoharan [A2],
which was actually siphoned off by G.Srinivasan [A1].
3.2. Out of the said sum of Rs.15 crores so siphoned off, G.Srinivasan
[A1] used Rs.1.07 crores to purchase 166 acres of land in Pudukottai Village
in the names of P.Venkatachalapathy [A4], P.Rajendran [A6] and K.Vignesh
[A7] from K.Gunasekaran, R.Sivakumar, Chinnakkannu and G.Selvarani
through various documents. The details of the sale deeds under which the
lands were purchased with the money provided by G.Srinivasan [A1] to the
Criminal Original Petition No.19880 of 2022
buyers viz., P.Venkatachalapathy [A4], P.Rajendran [A6] and K.Vignesh [A7]
have been set out in paragraph No.6.3 of the impugned complaint. The said
P.Venkatachalapathy [A4], P.Rajendran [A6] and K.Vignesh [A7] gave a
Power of Attorney in September 2009 to one R.Ayyappan in respect of the
lands that were purchased by them with the funds provided by G.Srinivasan
[A1]. K.Gunaseelan [A8] had purchased lands measuring 166 acres from
P.Venkatachalapathy [A4], P.Rajendran [A6] and K.Vignesh [A7] through
their power agent R.Ayyappan in February 2010. Thereafter, K.Gunaseelan
[A8] sold those lands to S.Palanichamy [A9], C.Chellamuthu [A10],
K.Kalimuthu         [A11],    V.Kuppusamy      [A12],    R.Natarajan          [A13]      and
V.Nattuthurai [A14], as could be seen from the chart given in paragraph
No.6.6 of the impugned complaint.
3.3. Reverting to the loan of Rs.15 crores that was obtained by BTM,
as stated supra, it was found that G.Srinivasan [A1] and R.Manoharan [A2]
had created fake documents in league with S.Arivarasu [A5], Manager of
GTFL for obtaining loan.
Criminal Original Petition No.19880 of 2022
3.4. While this being so, GTFL was merged with State Bank of India
and during reconciliation of the accounts, it was found that R.Manoharan[A2]
obtained the loan by producing fraudulent documents.
3.5. Therefore, on a complaint given by the State Bank of India, the
CBI registered a case in Crime No.RC-9(E)/2010 on 07.10.2010 and after
completing the investigation, filed a final report in C.C.No.6 of 2011 in the
Special Court for CBI cases, Coimbatore, for the offences u/s.120-B r/w 420,
467 and 471 IPC and Section 13 of the Prevention of Corruption Act against
G.Srinivasan [A1] and others, in which P.Rajendran [A6] herein is not an
accused. Since the CBI case disclosed the commission of a "scheduled
offence" under the PMLA, the Enforcement Directorate registered a case in
ECIR No.06/CEZO/PMLA/2011 and after completing the investigation, filed
a complaint in C.C.No.62 of 2016 in the Special Court for Prevention of
Money Laundering Act cases (Principal Sessions Judge, Chennai) for the
offence u/s.3 r/w 4 of the PMLA against 15 persons including
S.Arivarasu [A5], P.Rajendran [A6] and K.Vignesh [A7].
Criminal Original Petition No.19880 of 2022
3.6. This Court, in Crl.O.P.Nos.2821 and 5638 of 2017, has, by a
detailed order dated 21.03.2022, quashed the PMLA prosecution in
C.C.No.62 of 2016 against K.Gunaseelan [A8], S.Palanichamy[A9],
[A13], V.Nattuthurai [A14] and S.Kuppusamy [A15] on the short ground that
these persons were innocent purchasers, in that, they had purchased the said
property from P.Venkatachalapathy [A4], P.Rajendran [A6] and K.Vignesh
4. While so, P.Rajendran [A6] has filed the present quash petition to
quash the prosecution against him in C.C.No.62 of 2016.
5. Heard Mr.Sharath Chandran, learned counsel for the petitioner and
Mr.N.Ramesh, learned Special Public Prosecutor [ED] for the respondent.
6. The crux of the allegation against P.Rajendran [A6] is that,
G.Srinivasan [A1] and R.Manoharan [A2] had committed the criminal
Criminal Original Petition No.19880 of 2022
activity of cheating GTFL and had obtained a loan of Rs.15 crores from
GTFL, out of which, G.Srinivasan [A1] had purchased a property by a sale
deed dated 09.09.2009 in the name of P.Rajendran [A6], which, P.Rajendran
[A6] had subsequently sold to the accused, against whom, this Court has
quashed the prosecution, as stated above.
7. At this juncture, it may be relevant to extract the following
paragraphs from the impugned complaint:
"6.3. Inasmuch as Shri G.Srinivasan during the inquiry has
acceded that out of above funds he had purchased immovable
property admeasuing about 166 acres in Pudukottai Village from
S/Shri     K.Gunasekaran,     R.Sivakumar,      Chinnakkannu            and
Smt.G.Selvarani,     in    the     names     of     S/Shri        Vignesh,
P.Venkatachalapathy and Shri P.Rajendran, who were all
associated/known to him, for a declared amount of Rs.1.07 Crores,
inquiries were made with the said name lenders. Accordingly, Shri
P.Rajendran in his statement dated 15.02.2012 (Annexure-XIII)
under Section 50(2) & (3) of the PMLA, given before the Assitant
Director (PMLA), Directorate of Enforcement, Chennai, in response
to the enquiry on the details of the 5 acres and 76 cents of land
registered in his name, vide Document No.1559/2009 of SRO,
Chathirapatti had inter-alia stated that his younger brother, Shri
Venkatachalapathy and Shri G.Srinivasan of Udumalpet were close
friends; that Shri G.Srinivasan was looking after the business of the
firm, M/s.Sri Pamba Spinning Mills, which was managed by his
father; that his younger brother, Shri Venkatachalapathy joined with
the above said Shri G.Srinivasan during the year 2005 and was
Criminal Original Petition No.19880 of 2022
looking after the business of the aforesaid M/s.Sri Pamba Spinning
Mills; that later, in the year 2009, he came to understand that his
younger brother, Shri Venkatachalapathy and Shri G.Srinivasan were
in some problem; that his brother, Shri Venkatachalapathy, Shri
G.Srinivasan and one Shri Selvakumar, who was working with his
younger brother, were all arrested by the District Crime Branch,
Coimbatore, during July 2009 and about a month later they were
released on bail; that during September month the same year, Shri
G.Srinivasan told him that for about 5.76 acres land in his name he
had appointed one Shri.R.Sivakumar, who was working under him as
its power holder and if the land was in the name of the said
Sivakumar it would not be safe and hence he (Srinivasan) wished to
write the same in his name; that he agreed for the same and gave his
consent to get the above said 5.76 acres land transferred in his name
as arranged by Shri G.Srinivasan; that the land under Survey No.103,
having Patta No.395, totally constituted 17 acres and 28 cents and in
that 1/3 portion, i.e., 5 acres and 76 cents was transferred in his
name and registered as Document No.1559/2009 of SRO,
Chatthirapatti with a specified consideration of Rs.3,64,000/- as
arranged by Shri G.Srinivasan, but he neither received nor paid any
money; that later, in the last week of September 2009, the said Shri
G.Srinivasan told him to give power for the above said land of 5
acres and 76 cents land held in his name to one Shri.R.Ayyappan;
that Shri G.Srinivasan prepared a Power Document and obtained his
signature on it, which was registered in the SRO, Kaniyur as
Document No.184/2009, that as was arranged by Shri G.Srinivasan,
he gave power to the aforesaid Shri R.Ayyappan, S/o.Ramdas, a
resident of No.57-B, Vinayaka Apartment, Padmavathi Nagar Main
Road, Virugambakkam, Chennai - 92; that even for this he neither
received nor gave any money either from / to the above said Shri
G.Srinivasan or any other person, as the aforesaid land was not his
and belonged only to Shri G.Srinivasan; that further, as requested by
Shri G.Srinivasan he had been to Sub-Registrar's Office and signed
as a witness in another document relating to power given by one Shri
Vignesh to the aforesaid Shri Ayyappan for another land and that he
did not have any connection or dealings with the above said Shri
G.Srinivasan except the above.
Criminal Original Petition No.19880 of 2022
12.8. S/Shri P.Rajendran and K.Vignesh the other associates
of Shri G.Srinivasan connived with him in the scheme fraudulent
transactions and knowingly facilitated the investments of Shri
G.Srinivasan in the immovable properties by consciously lending
their names and acting as his benamis thereby camouflaged the said
funds from its actual source. Thus, S/Shri P.Rajendran and
K.Vignesh had actively facilitated utilization of a part of the
aforesaid proceeds of crime, as defined under Section 2(1)(u) of
PMLA towards investments in the immovable properties aggregating
to Rs.53,16,200/- Shri G.Srinivasan, besides acquiring inherent
pecuniary benefits for themselves.
13.6. It is humbly submitted that Shri P.Rajendran who was charged
of having committed the scheduled offences, furthermore having lent
his name for the purchase of the immovable properties and having
actively connived with Shri G.Srinivasan in camouflaging the
aforesaid immovable properties in which a part of the said proceeds
of crime aggregating to Rs.53,16,200/- had been invested by Shri
G.Srinivasan was actually involved in the process or activity
connected to "proceeds of crime" defined under Section 2(1)(u) of
PMLA and has thereby committed the offence of Money Laundering
as defined under Section 2(p) read with Section 3 of the PMLA,
which is punishable under Section 4 of the PMLA."
8. Mr.Sharath Chandran, learned counsel for the petitioner, submitted
that since P.Rajendran [A6] is not an accused in the CBI case in C.C.No.6 of
2011, his prosecution by the Enforcement Directorate in C.C.No.62 of 2016
is illegal in the light of the recent judgment of the Supreme Court in the case
Criminal Original Petition No.19880 of 2022
of Vijay Madanlal Choudhary and others v. Union of India and others1. In
support of this contention, he placed strong reliance on the following
paragraphs in the said judgment:
"253. Tersely put, it is only such property which is derived or
obtained, directly or indirectly, as a result of criminal activity
relating to a scheduled offence can be regarded as proceeds of crime.
The authorities under the 2002 Act cannot resort to action against
any person for money-laundering on an assumption that the property
recovered by them must be proceeds of crime and that a scheduled
offence has been committed, unless the same is registered with the
jurisdictional police or pending inquiry by way of complaint before
the competent forum. For, the expression “derived or obtained” is
indicative of criminal activity relating to a scheduled offence already
accomplished. Similarly, in the event the person named in the
criminal activity relating to a scheduled offence is finally absolved
by a Court of competent jurisdiction owing to an order of discharge,
acquittal or because of quashing of the criminal case (scheduled
offence) against him/her, there can be no action for money-
laundering against such a person or person claiming through him in
relation to the property linked to the stated scheduled offence. This
interpretation alone can be countenanced on the basis of the
provisions of the 2002 Act, in particular Section 2(1)(u) read with
Section 3. Taking any other view would be rewriting of these
provisions and disregarding the express language of definition clause
“proceeds of crime”, as it obtains as of now."
467 (d) The offence under Section 3 of the 2002 Act is
dependent on illegal gain of property as a result of criminal activity
relating to a scheduled offence. It is concerning the process or
activity connected with such property, which constitutes the offence
of money-laundering. The Authorities under the 2002 Act cannot
prosecute any person on notional basis or on the assumption that a
Criminal Original Petition No.19880 of 2022
scheduled offence has been committed, unless it is so registered with
the jurisdictional police and/or pending enquiry/trial including by
way of criminal complaint before the competent forum. If the person
is finally discharged/acquitted of the scheduled offence or the
criminal case against him is quashed by the Court of competent
jurisdiction, there can be no offence of money-laundering against
him or any one claiming such property being the property linked to
stated scheduled offence through him."
9. Mr.Sharath Chandran, learned counsel, contended that when the
accused in the predicate offence is discharged, acquitted or the proceedings
against him are quashed, the prosecution under the PMLA cannot be
maintained, which means that if a person is not prosecuted in the predicate
offence, his position being far better than the former, cannot be prosecuted
under the PMLA.
10. At the first blush, this argument did appear convincing. However,
the fallacy in the aforesaid submission was highlighted by Mr.N.Ramesh,
learned Special Public Prosecutor [ED], who brought to our notice that
paragraph Nos.253 and 467(d) of the judgment of the Supreme Court in Vijay
Madanlal's case [supra] deal with only the cases of persons named as
Criminal Original Petition No.19880 of 2022
accused in the predicate offence against whom the prosecution in the
predicate offence is quashed or he is discharged/acquitted. This benefit
cannot be extended to a person, who has not been arrayed as an accused in
the predicate offence because the offence under the PMLA is a stand alone
offence and is different and distinct from the predicate offence.
11. Learned Special Public Prosecutor submitted that for generating
"proceeds of crime", a "scheduled offence" must have been committed, after
the commission of the scheduled offence and generation of proceeds of crime,
different persons can join the main accused either as abettors or conspirators
for committing the offence of money laundering by helping him in laundering
the proceeds of crime; such persons may not be involved in the original
criminal activity that had resulted in the generation of "proceeds of crime",
therefore, just because they were not prosecuted for the predicate offence,
their prosecution for money laundering cannot be said to be illegal. There
appears to be much force in the aforesaid submission, especially, in the light
of paragraph 271 of the judgment in Vijay Madanlal's case [supra], which is
Criminal Original Petition No.19880 of 2022
"271. As mentioned earlier, the rudimentary understanding of
‘money-laundering’ is that there are three generally accepted stages
to money-laundering, they are:
(a) Placement : which is to move the funds from direct association of
the crime.
(b) Layering : which is disguising the trail to foil pursuit.
(c) Integration : which is making the money available to the criminal
from what seem to be legitimate sources."
12. That apart, paragraph No.467(d) of the Vijay Madanlal's case
[supra] only speaks about the discharge/ acquittal or quashment of
proceedings of the accused in the predicate offence and the consequences that
will follow for him in the PMLA prosecution. In that context, the Supreme
Court has held that such an accused cannot be prosecuted under the PMLA if
the case against him in the predicate offence has been quashed or he has been
discharged/acquitted. To be noted, a case is only an authority for what it
decides, as observed by Lord Halsbury in Quinn v. Leathem2, as follows:
"... that every judgment must be read as applicable to the
particular facts proved or assumed to be proved, since the generality
of the expressions which may be found there are not intended to be
expositions of the whole law, but are governed and qualified by the
Criminal Original Petition No.19880 of 2022
particular facts of the case in which such expressions are to be
found. The other is that a case is only an authority for what it
actually decides."
13. In Rajendra Singh v. State of U.P. & others3, the Supreme Court
has approvingly cited the above passage.
14. We cannot enlarge the scope of paragraph 467(d) of Vijay
Madanlal's case [supra] and read into it things that have not been said, in the
name of logical reasoning. Law is not always logic.
15. On facts, we find that Rajendran [A6] had voluntarily lent his name
for the purchase of the property under the sale deed dated 09.09.2009 with
the tainted money that was generated by G.Srinivasan [A1] and R.Manoharan
[A2] by committing a scheduled offence. Under Section 24 of the PMLA,
there is a statutory presumption which can be discharged only during trial.
In the result, this Criminal Original Petition is devoid of merits and the
same is accordingly dismissed. The trial Court shall proceed with the trial of
Criminal Original Petition No.19880 of 2022
the case without in any manner influenced by what is stated above as the
above observations are only for the limited purpose of disposing of this quash
petition.
