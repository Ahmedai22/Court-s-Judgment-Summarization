In this special leave petition the petitioner has challenged
an order dated 27.10.2021 passed by the High Court of Judicature at
Allahabad, Lucknow dismissing the criminal revision application by
the petitioner being CRLR No. 259/2021.
The  aforesaid   criminal     revisional    application   was  filed
an   order   passed     by   the   learned  Addl.   Sessions
Judge/Special Judge (POCSO Act), Bahraich, hereinafter referred to
as the Trial Court, dismissing the application of the petitioner
for discharge.
The facts giving rise to these proceedings are obnoxious.        The
prosecutrix is the daughter of the petitioner, only 19 years of
age.    It is alleged that she had been sexually abused.
In the petition, it is stated that the charge sheet was filed
implicating the petitioner of offences under various sections of
the Indian Penal Code (IPC) including Sections 354 and 376 thereof
as also Sections 5 and 6 of the Protection of Children from Sexual
Offences Act, 2012, hereinafter referred to as the “POCSO Act”.
Learned counsel appearing on behalf of the petitioner emphatically
argued that the POCSO Act came into force only on 14.11.2012.           The
incident alleged pertain to the period prior to the enforcement of
the POCSO Act.
The petitioner has not been charged only under the POCSO Act.
Even assuming that the petitioner could not have been charged under
the    POCSO  Act,  the  petitioner    has    been  charged  under  various
provisions of the IPC which were admittedly in force on the date of
the    alleged  offence.    The   learned     counsel  for  the  petitioner
emphatically argued that the FIR does not disclose offence under
Section 376 of the IPC.      The FIR is the initial document.        In her
statement given by the prosecutrix under Section 164 of the Code of
Criminal Procedure (CrPC) after the prosecutrix attained majority,
she categorically made statements which tantamount to offence under
Section 376 of the IPC.
Discrepancies between the FIR and any subsequent statement
under Section 164 of the CrPC may be a defence.             However, the
discrepancies cannot be a ground for discharge without initiation
of trial.
There is no infirmity in the order of the High Court rejecting
the criminal revisonal application.
The special leave petition is, accordingly, dismissed.
It is, however, made absolutely clear that the observations
made above are not to be construed as any finding of this Court
that there has been no offence under the POCSO Act or that the
prosecutrix has not been abused after commencement of the POCSO
Pending applications, if any, stand disposed of accordingly.
