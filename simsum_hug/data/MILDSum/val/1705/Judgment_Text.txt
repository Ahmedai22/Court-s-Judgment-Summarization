O.A. No. 136 of 2003 in the interest of justice;
(C) Such other and further relief or relieves as may be deem
fit, just and proper, in the facts and circumstances of the
2.     It appears that the writ-applicant is a loanee of M/s.Jalan
Forging Ltd., (in liquidation). The writ-applicant extended
financial assistance of Rs.48 lacs to the said company in
liquidation in the year 1992. The company in liquidation has
not paid the dues of the writ-applicant regularly. Consequently
the respondent No.1 preferred O.A. No.136 of 2003 on
26.5.2003. Originally Bank of Baroda had extended financial
assistance to the company in liquidation as stated by the
respondent No.1. The debt has been assigned by the Bank of
Baroda to the respondent No.1. Originally O.A. No.136 of 2003
was preferred by the Bank of Baroda, however subsequently
the respondent No.1 was substituted as the applicant in the
instant application in place of Bank of Baroda.
3.     It is the case of the original applicant before the DRT
that it had sanctioned various working credit facilities in the
year 1992 for an aggregate amount of Rs.340 lacs to the
company in liquidation. It is further averred by the respondent
in the O.A. that the respondents Nos.2 to 4 in their personal
capacity      had     provided a    corporate guarantee       and         have
executed the letters of encashment of debts in favour of the
original applicant. That the company in liquidation failed to
repay the dues. Further the company in liquidation also
approached BIFR and AAIFR for revival of the unit, whereby
the Bank of Baroda – original applicant was operating agency.
However, it was not viable to revive the unit and, therefore, it
was decided by the BIFR/AAIFR that the company should be
wound up. Ultimately the said orders were forwarded to the
High Court of Gujarat and the company in liquidation had
been directed to be wound up by order dated 6.3.2006 in
4.      It is submitted that the application of the original
applicant – respondent No.1 herein had been allowed by the
Presiding Officer, DRT-II, Ahmedabad by impugned order dated
5.    Being aggrieved by the aforesaid order passed by the
Presiding Officer, DRT-II, the writ-applicant herein approached
this Court on the ground that the DRT-II while passing the
impugned order has granted more than what was prayed for
by the original applicant – respondent No.1 herein.
6.      Mr. A. S. Asthavadi, the learned advocate appearing for
the writ-applicant submitted that the property in question has
been sold by the Official Liquidator and the claim of the writ-
applicant as the secured creditor having first charge over the
property is pending with the office of the Official Liquidator.
7.      Mr. Asthavadi, the learned advocate submitted that the
impugned order would cause irreparable loss to the writ-
applicant in view of the fact that the claim of the writ-
applicant is still pending before the Official Liquidator and by
the impugned order dated 27.06.2014 there is direction by the
DRT-II in para-2 which are as under :-
(2) In case of failure to deposit the above amount within the
stipulated period, the same shall be recovered from sale of
property as mentioned in the Schedule annexed with @.A.
The Applicant Company shall have first charge over the
property over which the second charge is created by way
mortgage with Gujarat State Financial Corporation which is
all piece and parcel of freehold land situated at Mouje Village
Kanjari,      bearing  survey    no.    2348,   taluka     Halol        Dist:
8.         Mr. Asthavadi, the learned advocate submitted that
there is no prayer of the applicant Company whereby it is
prayed to the learned Presiding Officer, DRT-II to hold that the
original applicant has first charge over the property of the
Company in liquidation.
9.        Mr. Asthavadi, the learned advocate has relied on the
order in favour of M/s. Ajar Enterprise of an amount of
Rs.4.25 crores and the sale is confirmed by order dated
18.3.2008 in the OLR No.37 of 2008 which is duly produced at
Annexure-E.           Mr.    Asthavadi,      the  learned     advocate            has
restricted his prayer to the aforesaid ground. The other
grounds are not pressed by the writ-applicant.
10.     Mr. R. D. Dave, the learned advocate appears for the
respondent No.8. Mr. Dave, the learned advocate supported the
submissions advanced by         Mr. Asthavadi, the learned advocate
appearing for the writ-applicant.
11.     Service of rule though served to all the respondents,
except respondent No.8 other respondents have not appeared.
12.     Having gone through the order passed by the DRT-II
dated 27.6.2014 in the O.A. No.136 of 2003 it appears that the
DRT-II has granted the relief which was not prayed for by the
original applicant – respondent No.2 herein. It is apposite to
produce the prayers as prayed for by the respondent No.1 in
the O.A. No.136 of 2003 which reads thus :-
“A. The Hon'ble Tribunal may be pleased to grant/issue
recovery Certificate in favour of applicant bank and against
the respondent no. 1 to 4 directing them to pay jointly and
severally a sum of Rs.7,74,34,618.00 being the due amount as
stated in Para 5 along with the further current and running
interest at the rate of 17% p.a. stated hereinabove on the due
amount with quarterly rests on the above due amount from
date of filing of this recovery application till the date of
realization thereof.
B The Hon'ble Tribunal may be pleased to send the Recovery
Certificate granted in terms of Para 6(a) to the Recovery
Officer appointed under the recovery of Debts due to banks
and financial Institution Act, 1993 to recover the decreetal
dues as per decree Recovery Certificate granted by Hon'ble
Tribunal out of the movable and Hypo. of goods/ Stocks and
other movable properties as well as immovable properties
belonging to the respondents including property mortgage
with the applicant bank.
C. The Hon'ble Tribunal may be pleased to direct the
Recovery officer to attach all movable properties such as
Hypothecated stock/goods, plant and machineries etc. as per
inventory report of Court Commissioner and other immovable

particularly described in the schedule hereunder written
dueing the pendency and final hearing and granting the
Recovery Certificate and be further ordered to dispose off the
said properties to recover the due amount towards the claim
as per the Recovery Application.
D.      The Hon'ble Tribunal may be pleased to award the cost
of the present recovery application.
E.      Any other of further relief/reliefs that may be deemed
fit to this Hon'ble Tribunal in the present circumstances of the
case in favour of the applicant and against the respondents.”
13.     The submissions advanced by Mr. Asthavadi, the learned
advocate appearing for the writ-applicant requires consideration
as can be seen from the above prayers there is no such prayer
as prayed for by the respondent No.1 as granted by the DRT-
14.    It appears that DRT-II has erred in granting the prayer
which was not prayed for even by the respondent No.1. The
impugned order is of 2014 and the writ-application is pending
adjudication for more than seven years. At this stage, this
Court is not inclined to relegate the writ-applicant to avail
statutory remedy. The ratio as laid down in the case of
Whirlpool Corporation vs. Registrar of Trade Marks, Mumbai
and Ors., reported in (1998) 8 SCC 1, paragraphs 14 to 22
“(14.) The power to issue prerogative writs under Art. 226 of
the Constitution is plenary in nature and is not limited by any
other provision of the Constitution. This power can be
exercised by the High Court not only for issuing writs in the
nature of Habeas Corpus, Mandamus, Prohibition, Quo Warrant
and Certiorari for the enforcement of any of the Fundamental
Rights contained in Part III of the Constitution but also for
"any other purpose".
(15.) Under Art. 226 of the Constitution, the High Court,
having regard to the facts of the case, has a discretion to
entertain or not to entertain a Writ Petition. But the High
Court has imposed upon itself certain restrictions one of which
is that if an effective and efficacious remedy is available, the
High Court would not normally exercise its jurisdiction. But
the alternative remedy has been consistently held by this Court
not to operate as a bar in at least three contingencies, namely,
where the writ petition has been filed for the enforcement of
any of the Fundamental Rights or where there has been a
violation of the principle of natural justice or where the order
of proceedings are wholly without jurisdiction or the vires of
an Act is challenged. There is a plethora of case-law on this
point put to cut down this circle of forensic Whirlpool, we
would rely on some old decisions of the evolutionary era of
the constitutional law as they still hold the field.
SC 163, laid down that existence of an adequate legal remedy
was a factor to be taken into consideration in the matter of
granting writs. This was followed by another Rashid case,
Commissioner, AIR 1954 SC 207, which reiterated the above
proposition and held that where alternative remedy existed, it
would be a sound exercise of discretion to refuse to interfere
in a petition under Art. 226. This proposition was, however,
qualified by the significant words, "unless there are good
grounds therefor", which indicated that alternative remedy
would not operate as an absolute bar and that writ petition
under Art. 226 could still be entertained in exceptional
(17.) Specific and clear rule was laid down in State of Uttar
Pradesh V/s. Mohd. Nooh, 1958 SCR 595 : AIR 1958 SC 86, as
"But this rule requiring the exhaustion of statutory
remedies before the writ will be granted is a rule of
policy, convenience and discretion rather than a rule of
law and instances are numerous where a writ of
certiorari has been issued in spite of the fact that the
aggrieved party had other adequate legal remedies.
(18.) This proposition was considered by a Constitution Bench
of this Court in A. V. Venkateswaran, Collector of Customs,
and was affirmed and followed in the following words (Para
"The passages in the judgments of this Court we have
extracted would indicate (1) that the two exceptions
which the learned Solicitor General formulated to the
normal rule as to the effect of the existence of an
adequate    alternative    remedy  were    by     no       means
exhaustive and (2) that even beyond them a discretion
vested in the High Court to have entertained the petition
and granted the petitioner relief notwithstanding the
existence of an alternative remedy. We need only add
that the broad lines of the general principles on which
the Court should act having been clearly laid down, their
application to the facts of each particular case must
necessarily be dependent on a variety of individual facts
which must govern the proper exercise of the discretion
of the Court, and that in a matter which is thus pre-
eminently one of discretion, it is not possible or even if
it were, it would not be desirable to lay down inflexible
rules which should be applied with rigidity in every case
which comes up before the Court."
(19.) Another constitution Bench decision in Calcutta Discount
"Though the writ of prohibition or certiorari will not
issue against an executive authority, the High Courts
have power to issue in a fit case an order prohibiting an
executive authority from acting without jurisdiction.
Where such action of an executive authority acting
without jurisdiction subjects or is likely to subject a
person     to  lengthy      proceedings    and      unnecessary
harassment. The High Court will issue appropriate orders
or directions to prevent such consequences. Writ of
certiorari and prohibition can issue against Income Tax
Officer acting without jurisdiction u/s. 34, I.-T. Act."
(20.) Much water has since flown beneath the bridge, but there
has been no corrosive effect on these decisions which, though
old, continue to hold the field with the result that law as to
the jurisdiction of the High Court in entertaining a writ
petition under Art. 226 of the Constitution, in spite of the
alternative statutory remedies, is not affected, specially in a
case where the authority against whom the writ is filed is
shown to have had no jurisdiction or had purported to usurp
jurisdiction without any legal foundation.”
In the facts and circumstances of the present case, this
Court is inclined to exercise its extraordinary jurisdiction under
Article 226 of the Constitution of India, more particularly in
view of the fact that it clearly transpires from the perusal of
the prayers in the O.A. No.136 of 2003 and the order dated
27.6.2014 passed by the DRT-II that the DRT-II has granted
the relief which was not prayed for in the above referred
application by the applicant.
15.        Accordingly this Court is inclined to modify the order
dated 27.06.2014 qua direction No.2 passed by Ld. Presiding
Officer, D.R.T. - II, Ahmedabad in O.A. No. 136 of 2003
whereby the DRT-II has directed thus :-
“2) … … … The Applicant Company shall have first charge
over the property over which the second charge is created by
way mortgage with Gujarat State Financial Corporation …
The said direction in paragraph (2) is directed to be
quashed and set aside. The rest of the order shall remain the
16.      In view of above, the writ-application stands allowed.
Rule is made absolute to the aforesaid extent.
