Mrs G. P. Mulekar, APP for the Respondent-State.
By this Appeal filed under Section 374 of the Code of
Criminal Procedure, 1973, the Appellant seeks to challenge the
apeal-634.2014.doc
Judgment dated 15           September 2011 passed by the learned
Sessions Judge, Pune, in Sessions Case No. 556 of 2010, whereby
the Appellant is convicted for committing an offence punishable
under Section 302 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860.                                  He was
sentenced to undergo imprisonment for life together with payment
of the fine of Rs.500/- and in default of payment of fine, he has
been sentenced to undergo rigorous imprisonment for six months.
2.        Background facts, in a nutshell, are as follows:
i)        Accused/Appellant Uttam Lande was residing at village
Takve Budruk along with his wife Sangita and two sons, namely,
Balaji and Dyneshwar. The accused was addicted to liquor. After
consuming liquor, he used to threaten his wife that he would not
keep her alive.
ii)       On 29.04.2010 at about 6:00 am, accused Uttam consumed
liquor and insisted his wife Sangita not go to work. On refusal, the
accused got infuriated and raked up a quarrel, stating that he would
see how she could go for work. He then poured kerosene on her
and set her on fire. Sangita began shouting; hearing her screams,
the neighbours rushed to her rescue and extinguished the fire. She
suffered burn injuries on her face, chest, abdomen and thighs. She
was immediately taken to Dr Dahiphale’s clinic in the same village.
apeal-634.2014.doc
On his advice, she was shifted to Sassoon Hospital, Pune. As it was
a case of burning, the Police were informed.
visited the hospital and consulted Medical Officer Dr Raghvendra
Chalikwar to record the statement of Sangita. Upon examination of
Sangita, Dr Chalikwar found her in a fit condition to give a
statement. Accordingly, on 29.04.2010 at about 4:30 pm, PHC Mr
Waghule, in the presence of Dr Chalikwar, recorded her statement
wherein she alleged that her husband/accused poured kerosene on
her person and set her ablaze. Her statement was then forwarded
to Vadgaon Maval Police Station for further action. Based on this,
an offence bearing C.R. No. 74 of 2010 under Section 307 of the
Indian Penal Code came to be registered against the accused.
Panchnama of the scene of occurrence came to be drawn.
Incriminating articles found thereat were seized. Seized articles
were sent to the forensic science laboratory for analysis.                              The
witnesses were interrogated, and their statements were recorded.
iv)       On 03.05.2010, the brother of Sangita shifted her to Pawana
Hospital for further medical treatment. However, on 06.05.2010,
Sangita succumbed to the burn injuries and, therefore, the offence
was converted to one under Section 302 of the Indian Penal Code.
apeal-634.2014.doc
v)        Inquest on the dead body of the deceased was held. The
autopsy examination of the deceased was conducted.                                     Police
procured postmortem notes and the report from the forensic
science laboratory. As the investigation revealed the complicity of
the accused in the offence punishable under Section 302 of the
Indian Penal Code, a charge sheet came to be lodged against him.
3.        To prove its case, the prosecution examined as many as seven
witnesses and tendered a number of documents. The evidence of
the prosecution can be conveniently classified into three parts.
Firstly, the dying declaration allegedly made by the deceased, which
was sought to be proved through the testimony of PHC Shashikant
Waghule (PW1) and Dr Raghvendra Chalikwar (PW2). Secondly,
the medical evidence formed by the testimony of Dr Raghvendra
Chalikwar (PW2), Dr Madhav Waghmare (PW4) and Dr Ashwin
Masane (PW5), and the documents came to be proved in their
evidence. Thirdly, circumstantial evidence in the nature of the
Scene of Occurrence Panchnama and Chemical Analyzer’s Report.
After the completion of prosecution evidence, the statement of the
accused was recorded under Section 313 of the Code of Criminal
Procedure, 1973, wherein the entire incriminating evidence was
put to the accused. In reply, the accused pleaded innocence and
apeal-634.2014.doc
false implication at the instance of the deceased’s brother.
According to him, Sangita sustained burn injuries from the bursting
of a kerosene stove while cooking a meal.
4.        The learned Sessions Judge relying on the statement of
Sangita made before PHC Shashikant Waghule and Dr Raghvendra
Chalikwar and which has been treated as the dying declaration of
Sangita (hereinafter referred to as ‘the deceased’) and the testimony
of the witnesses and documents, found that the prosecution case
had been proved beyond doubt and held the accused guilty and
convicted him under Section 302 of the Indian Penal Code.
Evidence of PW1 and PW2 are relied upon to repose the faith in
the dying declaration.
5.        Mr Abhishek Avchat, learned counsel appearing on behalf of
the Appellant, submitted that the learned trial Court committed a
manifest error in returning a finding of guilt sans legal evidence.
According to him, no reliance could be placed on the statement,
which was considered to be the dying declaration of the deceased,
as the declaration was not made to a Magistrate but to a Police
Officer, and no explanation was offered as to why the declaration
could not be made to the Magistrate. The cause of burn injuries is
attributed to the accidental bursting of the stove.
apeal-634.2014.doc
6.        To further raise suspicion on the dying declaration, it is
submitted that the facts and circumstances of the case demonstrate
that the deceased was in no state to make a statement because of
her suffering 72% burn injuries. Also, there was no corroborating
evidence of this alleged dying declaration. In his view, in the
absence of any corroboration of the dying declaration, the
conviction could not be justified.
7.        It has been submitted that the neighbours, who took the
deceased to the hospital and the brother of the deceased, who got
her discharged from Sassoon Hospital and admitted her to a private
hospital, have not been examined, nor have any independent
witnesses, though available, was examined by the prosecution.
8.        It has been submitted that Dr Hariram Dahiphale (PW7) has
stated that the deceased informed him that she suffered burn
injuries due to the bursting of the stove accidentally. There is
inconsistency in the evidence of Dr Dahiphale, narration in the
FIR, and the dying declaration of the deceased.
9.        It has been submitted that though the incident occurred on
29.04.2010 at about 6:00 am, the dying declaration was recorded at
apeal-634.2014.doc
about 4:30 pm, as such, ample time for tutoring was available.
Further, it has been submitted that there are discrepancies in the
medical papers of Sassoon and Pawana Hospitals, as the papers of
Pawana Hospital show accidental burns as against homicidal burns.
10.       According to the learned counsel for the Appellant, the trial
Court did not examine the evidence from a proper perspective. He
complains that the trial Court has misread the prosecution evidence
and was influenced by several assumptions which cannot be
sustained based on the material on record, and this has resulted in a
grave miscarriage of justice. In support of his contentions, the
learned counsel relied on the decision in Uttam v/s. State of
11.       Mrs G. P. Mulekar, learned Additional Prosecutor appearing
for the respondent-State, made various submissions countering the
arguments put forth by the Appellant. She submitted that the
deceased had narrated a detailed incident, which is amply
corroborated by the medical evidence, wherein she had explicitly
named the Appellant as a culprit.
12.       It has been submitted that the evidence of Dr Chalikwar
(PW2) shows that at the time of admission, the deceased had given
apeal-634.2014.doc
a history of homicidal burns. This witness stated that before the
recording of the dying declaration of the deceased, he examined her
and found her to be conscious and oriented to time, place and
person. In his presence, PHC Waghule, as per narration given by
Sangita, recorded her dying declaration.
13.       Learned APP invited our attention to the fact that the Police
Head Constable, who had recorded the dying declaration, was not
the Investigating Officer, nor was he posted at Vadgaon Maval
Police Station. According to her, the conviction in a murder case
based on a truthful dying declaration, even made to the Police
Officer and not to the Magistrate, is sufficient to convict the
accused.        According to her, no fault can be found with the
14.       It is submitted that there is only one dying declaration
recorded on 29.04.2010 at about 4:30 pm. The evidence of PW1
and PW2 corroborates the dying declaration. Panchnama of the
scene of occurrence does not support the theory of the bursting of
the stove.       It is pointed out that after examining Sangita, Dr
Chalikwar (PW2) endorsed the dying declaration to the effect that
she was in sound condition to give the statement. After that, he
apeal-634.2014.doc
claimed to have signed the dying declaration, which came to be
proved in the evidence.
15.       It is a settled position of law that a dying declaration must not
necessarily be made to a Magistrate only.                                       What is essentially
required is that the person who records a dying declaration must be
satisfied that the deceased was in a fit state of mind.
16.       In Jaswant Singh v/s. State (Delhi Administration) 2, it is held
that conviction in the murder case based on a truthful dying
declaration, even made to Police Official and not to the Magistrate,
is sufficient to convict the accused.
17.       In State of Uttar Pradesh v/s. Ramsagar Yadav & Ors. 3, the
Hon’ble Supreme Court, has observed that a dying declaration can
be acted upon without corroboration. There is not even a rule of
prudence which has hardened into a rule of law that a dying
declaration cannot be acted upon unless it is corroborated. The
primary effort of the Court has to be to find out whether the dying
declaration is true, it is only if the circumstances surrounding the
dying declaration are not clear or convincing that the Court may,
for its assurance, look for corroboration to the dying declaration.
apeal-634.2014.doc
18.       In Ramawati Devi v/s. State of Bihar4, it was enunciated that
there is no requirement of law that a dying declaration must
necessarily be made to a Magistrate. What evidentiary value or
weight has to be attached to such a statement must necessarily
depend on the facts and circumstances of each particular case. In a
proper case, it may be permissible to convict a person based on a
dying declaration in light of the facts and circumstances of the case.
19.       In Jagbir Singh v/s. State (NCT of Delhi) 5, after referring to
its previous pronouncements in Paniben v/s. State of Gujarath6,
wherein the principles of a dying declaration were expounded as
“(i) There is neither rule of law nor of prudence that
dying declaration cannot be acted upon without
corroboration. (Munnu Raja & Anr. v/s. State of
(ii) If the Court is satisfied that the dying declaration
is true and voluntary it can base conviction on it,
without corroboration. (State of Uttar Pradesh v/s. Ram
Sagar Yadav8, Ramawati Devi v/s. State of Bihar9)
apeal-634.2014.doc
(iii) This Court has to scrutinize the dying declaration
carefully and must ensure that the declaration is not the
result of tutoring, prompting or imagination. The
deceased had opportunity to observe and identify the
assailants and was in a fit state to make the declaration.
(K. Ramchandra Reddy v/s. Public Prosecutor10)
(iv) Where dying declaration is suspicious it should
not be acted upon without corroborative evidence.
(Rasheed Beg v/s. State of Madhya Pradesh11)
(v) Where the deceased was unconscious and could
never make any dying declaration the evidence with
regard to it is to be rejected. (Kake Singh v/s. State of
(vi) A dying declaration which suffers from infirmity
cannot form the basis of conviction. (Ram Manorath
v/s. State of Uttar Pradesh13)
(vii) Merely because a dying declaration does not
contain the details as to the occurrence, it is not to be
rejected. (State of Maharashtra v/s. Krishnamurti
(viii) Equally, merely because it is a brief statement, it is
not to be discarded. On the contrary, the shortness of
apeal-634.2014.doc
the statement itself guarantees truth. (Surajdeo Ojha
v/s. State of Bihar15)
(ix) Normally the Court in order to satisfy whether
deceased was in a fit mental condition to make the
dying declaration look up to the medical opinion. But
where the eyewitnesses had said that the deceased was
in a fit and conscious state to make this dying
declaration, the medical opinion cannot prevail.
(Nanhau Ram v/s. State of Madhya Pradesh16)
(x) Where the prosecution version defers from the
version as given in the dying declaration, the said
declaration cannot be acted upon. (State of Uttar
Pradesh v/s. Madan Mohan17)”
20.       A survey of these decisions would show that the mere fact
that the dying declaration was recorded by a Police Official cannot
be a ground to discard the same.                                             It is for the defence to
demonstrate that the Police Official has some agenda or motive to
record a false statement or to fabricate the statement of the victim
of the crime. Conviction of a person can be made solely on the
basis of a dying declaration which inspires the confidence of the
Court. If there is nothing suspicious about the declaration, no
corroboration is necessary. The Court must be satisfied that there is
no tutoring or prompting.
apeal-634.2014.doc
21.       On the aforesaid touchstone, reverting to the facts of the
present case, it is pertinent to note that the defence has not
disputed the fact of the death of the deceased because of burn
injuries on 06.05.2010. The crux of the matter is whether the
death was homicidal. Further, whether the deceased was in a fit
condition to make the declaration and whether the declaration was
voluntary and true.
22.       It is not in dispute that Sangita sustained burn injuries at her
residential house on 29.04.2010. The plea sought to be raised on
behalf of the appellant that the deceased suffered burn injuries due
to the accidental bursting of the stove are negativated by the fact
that the scene of occurrence panchnama does not show the
presence of kerosene stove leaves apart in bursting state at the spot
of the incident. Neither accused stepped into the witness box nor
examined any witness to prove the case of the accidental bursting of
the stove.
23.       On the contrary, there is evidence on record, both in the form
of oral testimony and documentary evidence, to show that a nylon
saree, and a petticoat, in burnt condition, and a plastic can
containing kerosene oil and a matchbox were found at the spot of
apeal-634.2014.doc
the incident. These articles were also sent for forensic examination.
It is seen from the report of the chemical analyser that traces of
kerosene oil were found on the burned clothes of the deceased.
Evidence of PW3 Santosh panch witness and PW6, the
Investigating Officer Gorakh Tupe, duly proves the scene of
offence panchnama Exh.19.
24.       The next question is whether the deceased was in a physical
and mental condition to make a dying declaration. In this respect,
the evidence of PHC Mr Shashikant Waghule (PW1) shows that
the deceased was brought to the Sassoon General Hospital, Pune,
on 29.04.2010. On receiving information from PHC Tilekar, he
went to the Sassoon Hospital, met the Medical Officer and
requested him to certify the fitness of Sangita to record her
statement. Accordingly, the Medical Officer examined her and
found her conscious and oriented to time, place and person. He
claimed to have recorded the statement of the deceased as per her
version. He further deposed that the statement was read over to
Sangita and obtained her foot-thumb impression.
25.       According to Mr Waghule (PW1), the deceased had stated
that in the last two months, her husband had started taking
excessive liquor and used to tell her that one day he would not keep
apeal-634.2014.doc
her alive. On 29.04.2010, at about 6:00 pm, her husband directed
her not to go to work, and on refusing, he threatened her that he
would see how she would go to work and that he would not keep
her alive. After that, her husband poured kerosene on her person
and set her on fire with a matchstick. When she started crying and
shouting, neighbours came to her rescue and put off the fire and
admitted her to the hospital.
26.       Mr Waghule (PW1) claimed that he had recorded the
statement of the deceased in the presence of the Medical Officer.
The Medical Officer then put his endorsement certifying that the
deceased was conscious and oriented to time, place and person;
before, during and at the end of the statement.
27.       Dr Raghvendra Chalikwar (PW2), the Medical Officer
attached to the Sassoon General Hospital, seeks to lend support to
the claim of Mr Waghule (PW1). Dr Chalikwar (PW2) informed
the Court that the deceased was admitted to the hospital on
29.04.2010. At the time of her admission, she had given a history
of homicidal burn injuries.                   He stated that the Police Head
Constable recorded the statement of Sangita in his presence as per
the narration given by her. He stated that he made an endorsement
over the dying declaration of Sangita that she was conscious and
apeal-634.2014.doc
oriented to time, place and person before, during and at the end of
the dying declaration (Exh.13). The evidence of PW1 and PW2
would demonstrate that at the time of recording dying declaration
of Sangita, she was in a condition to make the statement.
28.       There is no acceptable material or circumstances to suspect
that the PHC Mr Waghule (PW1), who recorded the dying
declaration or the Medical Officer (PW2), had any animus against
the accused or were in any way interested in fabricating a dying
declaration. In such circumstances, the dying declaration recorded
by the PW1, who was performing his official duties, sufficiently
assures that the deceased was capable of making the dying
29.       On the next count, as to whether the dying declaration was
voluntary and true and free from tutoring or prompting, it is seen
from the record, more particularly the hospital papers, that when
the deceased was admitted to the Sassoon Hospital, the accused was
present with her. This fact automatically rules out the possibility of
tutoring the deceased to implicate the accused falsely in the crime.
Even the evidence of PW2 shows that at the time of recording the
dying declaration of the deceased her relatives were sent out.
apeal-634.2014.doc
30.       It is not in dispute that immediately after the incident, the
deceased was taken to the clinic of Dr Hariram Dahiphale (PW7).
One contradiction is brought on record from the evidence of this
witness.        This contradiction, on its proof by the Investigating
Officer (PW6), is at Exh. 63. This witness had stated to the Police
while recording his statement that the deceased had told him that
she sustained burns while cooking food because of the bursting of
the stove. In this respect, the learned Sessions Judge has rightly
observed that this contradiction cannot be accepted as substantive
evidence, but it can, at the most, impeach the credit of Dr Hariram
(PW7), and no inference can be drawn from the evidence that the
dying declaration of Sangita at Exh. 13 is not truthful.
31.       Similarly, the confusion created by medical case papers at
Exh.23 of Pawana Hospital shows that the deceased sustained
accidental burns. But here, we cannot ignore the evidence of PW5
Dr Ashwin, the Resident Medical Officer of Pawana Hospital, who
categorically states that at the time of admission of the deceased,
she had not given the history. Therefore, it does not amount to her
dying declaration. In this respect, the learned Sessions Judge had
rightly held that the contention of the learned defence counsel that
the first dying declaration was made by the deceased before Dr
Dahiphale (PW7) and her third dying declaration was before the
apeal-634.2014.doc
hospital authorities of Pawana Hospital was devoid of substance as
no such dying declarations were found to be made by the accused.
32.       Lastly, Mr Abhishek Avachat, the learned counsel appearing
for the Appellant, submitted that the alleged incident was not pre-
mediated. The dispute ensued over a trivial matter. There is no
material to suggest that the Appellant had any intention of causing
the death of his wife. His rage had dominated his passive spirit,
and in an impulsive moment, rage had become an act of aggression.
He had no intention to commit an act which would result in the
death of his wife and, therefore, his act would fall under Section
304 Part II of the Indian Penal Code.
33.       Reference in this connection was made to the following cases:
(i)   Jai Prakash v/s. State (Delhi Administration)18
(ii)  Kesar Singh & Anr. v/s. State of Haryana19
(iii) Haridas Bedare v/s. The State of Maharashtra20
(iv) Subhash Kumbar v/s. State of Maharashtra21
34.       Mrs Mulekar, the learned Additional Public Prosecutor
appearing for the Respondent-State, made various submissions
countering the arguments put forward by the Appellant.                                          She
20  Criminal Appeal No. 966 of 2015 decided on 18.10.2022
21  Criminal Appeal No. 744 of 2017 decided on 06.10.2022
apeal-634.2014.doc
submitted that the deceased Sangita had narrated a detailed
incident which is amply corroborated by the medical evidence
wherein she had specifically named the Appellant as a culprit.
35.       We have given anxious consideration to the submissions of
the learned counsel for the parties. Also perused the Judgments
relied upon by the learned counsel for the Appellant.
36.       In order to bring the act of an accused within the purview of
Section 304 Part I or Part II of the Indian Penal Code, it is not
sufficient to prove that the incident took place all of a sudden
without any premeditation, but, it is also to be proved that the
accused did not take undue advantage or did not act cruelly. In the
present case, the act of the accused of pouring the kerosene oil on
the person of the deceased, setting her ablaze and not extinguishing
the fire would speak entirely against him and demonstrates the
intention and knowledge on the part of the Appellant.                                          The
deceased was the wife of the Appellant and was alone in the house.
The Appellant had taken undue advantage of the situation and
acted cruelly.        Even if the incident in question was not
premeditated        and   sudden,                the               manner    of retaliation        is
disproportionate. The learned Sessions Judge in the impugned
judgment has rightly observed that the act of the accused in setting
apeal-634.2014.doc
ablaze the deceased was an intentional act for causing her death,
and it was preceded by threats emanated from him that he would
not let her alive. Thus, by no stretch of the imagination, it can be
said that the offence would not be murder punishable under
Section 302 of the Indian Penal Code.
37.       We have already concluded that the dying declaration of the
deceased recorded by PW1 is truthful and voluntary and that she
was in a sound condition to give a valid statement. The learned
counsel for the Appellant was not in a position to show any
infirmity in this dying declaration, either in the form of procedure
adopted or any circumstance leading that it was not voluntary or
was given under the influence. Significantly, the Appellant has not
come with any version that he tried to rescue his wife from the
burning. Again, his act of setting the deceased ablaze and not
extinguishing the fire would speak entirely against him. Therefore,
in our overall view of the matter, we are not convinced with the
case of the defence that the accused suffered from accidental burn
injuries, and the instant case is not one of homicidal death. The
trial Court has discussed the entire evidence in detail and, in our
opinion, has reached the right conclusion that the prosecution has
been able to establish the case against the accused beyond a
reasonable doubt.
38.       Resultantly, this Appeal fails and is hereby dismissed. The
order of conviction and sentence passed by the learned Sessions
Judge, Pune, in Sessions Case No. 556 of 2010, is hereby
