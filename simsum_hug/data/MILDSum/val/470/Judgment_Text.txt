W.P.(C) No.19714 of 2021
Dated this the 18th day of May, 2022
Petitioner is the Manager of Sankara Menon Memorial
Higher        Secondary       School      (for   short   the     School).
Smt.Sivakumari R., the fourth respondent, was the Principal of
the School.       She was initially suspended on 22.09.2020 which
was extended for six months on 06-10-2020. The order of
suspension was challenged by Smt.Sivakumari R., before this
Court. By judgment dated 30.03.2021 in W.P.(C) No.125859 of
2020, this Court set aside the order of suspension as well as the
order extending the period of suspension and issued the
following directions:
“In the afore circumstances, I have no hesitation to
hold that the petitioner has made out a case
warranting interference by this Court; and resultantly,
I allow this Writ Petition and quash Exts.P18 and P20,
however, leaving full liberty to the Manager and to the
competent Educational Authorities to initiate and
conclude any action against the petitioner, that may
be permissible under the KER, but only as per law and
after following the imperative and mandatory
procedure established under it.”
2. Immediately thereafter, on 07.04.2021, petitioner once
again suspended the fourth respondent.              Alleging that the
Manager's refusal to reinstate her, pursuant to the judgment
dated 30.03.2021, amounted to contempt of court, the fourth
respondent        filed Contempt    Case    (Civil) No.788   of  2021.
However, by judgment dated 10.08.2021, this Court closed the
contempt case, observing that if there was a violation of the
statute, the remedy was to challenge it.
3.    In the meantime, petitioner filed W.P.(C) No.10368 of
2021 seeking a direction to the Director of General Education
(for short 'DGE') to consider the request for extension of the
period of suspension imposed on the fourth respondent on
07-04-2021. The writ petition was disposed of by Ext.P6,
directing a decision to be taken within two weeks.                The
impugned order dated 06.09.2021 was issued by the second
respondent thereafter, directing the fourth respondent to be
reinstated in service.
4.     A counter affidavit has been filed by the fourth
respondent contending that the DGE had declined the request of
the Manager to grant an extension of the order of suspension,
since, to continue the suspension of a teacher beyond 15 days,
sanction has to be obtained and for that purpose petitioner
himself had filed W.P.(C) No.10368 of 2021 and obtained a
direction to the DGE to consider the representation. It was also
pleaded that on the expiry of the initial period of the order of
suspension, the fourth respondent ought to have been re-
inducted in service, as this Court had set aside the order of
suspension. However, without reinducting the fourth respondent,
another suspension order was issued as Ext.R4(a) for which an
extension of period was also sought. A detailed representation
was given as Ext.R4(b). Ext.R4(a) was issued in continuation of
the earlier suspension order, which is legally not sustainable and
hence, fourth respondent is liable to be reinstated. The fourth
respondent also pleaded that as per Rule 67 of Chapter XIVA of
KER, a teacher whose suspension has not been extended is
duty-bound to be reinstated and also that liberty was granted by
Ext.P1 only to proceed with the disciplinary action.        Fourth
respondent is kept under suspension from 23.09.2020 and no
subsistence allowance has been paid after February, 2021 and
further that since the order of suspension was set aside by this
Court, fourth respondent is entitled for salary from 23-09-2020
to 04–07-2021, excluding the 15 days from 07-04-2021. It was
further pleaded that even otherwise, salary is liable to be paid to
the fourth respondent from 22.04.2021.
5. I have heard Sri.Kodoth Sreedharan, the learned counsel
for the petitioner, Sri.P.C.Sasidharan, the learned counsel for the
fourth respondent as well as Sri.George Abraham, learned
counsel for the fifth respondent apart from Smt. Nisha Bose, the
6. Indisputably the order of suspension imposed upon the
fourth respondent was set aside by this Court in W.P.(C)
No.2589 of 2020 and therefore there was no suspension or
extension of suspension from 23-09-2020 till 07-04-2021. On
the basis of the liberty granted by this Court to the petitioner to
initiate and conclude any action against the fourth respondent, a
fresh order of suspension was issued on 07-04-2021.              An
application was also filed before the second respondent seeking
extension of suspension beyond 15 days and by the judgment in
W.P.(C) No.10368 of 2021, this Court directed the second
respondent to pass appropriate orders. Consequent to the said
direction and the objection filed by the fourth respondent, the
second respondent issued Ext.P7 impugned order, directing the
Manager to reinstate the fourth respondent.
7. In the decision in Varghese v. Deputy Director of
Education (2000 (2) KLT 109), this Court held that Rule 67 of
chapter XIVA of the KER will not apply to the Higher Secondary
Schools. However, as per GO(MS) No.235(1)/2009/G.Edn. dated
05-12-2009, it was ordered that the provisions against the
teaching and non-teaching staff of aided schools shall apply
mutatis mutandis to the teaching and non-teaching staff of
Aided Higher Secondary Schools. Subsequently, the proviso to
Rule 67 and Rule 68 of Chapter XIVA of KER was amended by
SRO No.433/2019 dated 30-06-2019 in exercise of the powers
under section 36 of the Act. After the amendment, the proviso
to Rule 67(7) of KER reads as below:
“provided that no teacher shall be placed under
suspension by the manager for a continuous period
exceeding 15 days without the previous sanction of such
other officer authorised by the Government in the case of
teachers of Higher Secondary course and Principal and the
Deputy     Director    (Education)  in   the    case    of
Headmaster/Headmistress/Vice-Principal of Secondary
Schools and Training School and of the Educational Officer
in other cases.”
In view of the above amendment to Rule 67(7) and the
amendment carried out to Rule 68, there can be no quarrel that
the provisions of Rule 67 and 68 as it stands, apply to the
teachers of Higher Secondary Schools also. The decision of the
Full Bench in Varghese's case (supra) cannot have any
application in view of the change in statutory provisions.
8. A reading of the proviso to Rule 67(7) of Chapter XIV A
of KER shows that sanction to extend the period of suspension
can be granted by the officer authorised by the Government.
Though the power of suspension is only with the Manager and
for the first 15 days the said power is absolute, the subsequent
power to extend the period of suspension is a regulated power.
[See the decision in Manager, S.N.V. High School v. State of
Kerala (1982 KLT 229)].       The statutory regulations as far as
Higher Secondary Schools are concerned obligate an officer
authorised by the Government alone to grant previous sanction
to continue the period beyond 15 days. In other words, only the
authorized officer can grant sanction extending the period of
suspension beyond 15 days.
9.    The learned Government Pleader submitted that no
such authorisation has been issued by the Government till date
conferring such a power on the DGE to extend the period of
suspension. Thus, in the absence of any officer having been
authorised to grant sanction to extend the period of 15 days of
suspension, the Government alone can extend the period. The
second respondent cannot grant sanction to extend the period of
suspension. Therefore when this Court directed the second
respondent to pass orders on the application filed by the
petitioner to extend the period of suspension, the second
respondent could not have issued any order extending the
period of suspension. Petitioner’s application to the second
respondent cannot be treated as a valid application to extend
the period of suspension. Therefore in the eye of law, there is no
application filed by the petitioner before the proper authority, to
extend the period of suspension.
10. It is trite law that in the absence of an order extending
the suspension period beyond 15 days, the teacher is entitled for
reinstatement in service. In the instant case, the order of
suspension is not in existence after 23-04-2021. The impugned
order Ext.P7 directing the fourth respondent to be reinstated in
service, therefore, does not call for any interference, even
though the reasons given therein for arriving at the said
conclusion, are different. The circumstances of the instant case
do not manifest a need to exercise the discretionary jurisdiction
under Article 226 of the Constitution of India and hence I find no
merit in this writ petition.
The writ petition fails and is hence dismissed.
