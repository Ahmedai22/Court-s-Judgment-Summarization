This appeal is filed challenging the judgment and award
dated 20.04.2013, passed in M.V.C.No.717/2011, on the file of
Tribunal’ for short) praying to modify the judgment and award.
2.     The factual matrix of the case of the claimant before
the Tribunal is that in an accident he had sustained the injuries
on account of rash and negligent driving of the motor vehicle
insured   with   respondent    No.1  and   the  Tribunal  awarded
compensation of amount of Rs.2,88,000/- with interest at the
rate of 7% per annum.         Being aggrieved by the same, the
claimant is in appeal before this Court.
3.    The   learned   counsel   for   the   appellant   would
vehemently contend that the Tribunal has committed an error in
taking the income of the appellant as Rs.4,000/- per month
instead of Rs.6,501/- per month, as the appellant was drawing
monthly salary of Rs.6,501/- by working in BSS Micro Finance
Pvt. Ltd., Kondajji Road, Davanagere.     The Tribunal committed
an error in awarding lesser compensation under the head future
loss of income. The Tribunal committed an error in not awarding
any amount under the head future medical expenses and
incidental expenses.   The learned counsel would contend that
the Tribunal committed an error in directing respondent Nos.1
and 2 to pay the compensation and the liability of the Insurance
Company is exonerated in coming to the conclusion that the
offending vehicle was not registered and as such, temporary
registration which was issued to the said vehicle was also
expired on the date of the accident.
4.    The learned counsel would contend that the Full
Bench of this Court in the case of NEW INDIA ASSURANCE
CO.    LTD.   v.   YALLAVVA       AND     ANOTHER       passed    in
M.F.A.No.30131/2010 dated 12.05.2020, while answering the
questions referred held that, the Insurer is liable to pay the third
party and recover from the insured even if there is breach of any
condition recognized under Section 149(2), even if it is a
fundamental breach (that is breach of condition which is the
cause for the accident) and the insurer proves the said breach in
view of the mandate under Section 149(1) of the Act. But, no
such order can be passed against the insurer, if, on the facts and
circumstances of a case, a finding is given by the court that the
third party (injured or deceased) had played any fraud or was in
collusion with the insured, individually or collectively, for a
wrongful gain to themselves or cause wrongful loss to the
insurer. The Court can also fasten the absolute liability on the
insurer, if there is any breach of condition which is enumerated
under Section 149(2) of the Act or any other condition of the
policy if the Insurance Company has waived breach of any such
condition or has taken the special responsibility to pay by
collecting extra premium by covering any type of risk depending
upon facts of each case.
5.    The learned counsel referring this judgment would
contend that even if the Court comes to the conclusion that
there is a breach of any condition recognized under Section
149(2) of the MV Act, even if it is a fundamental breach, the
insurer is liable to pay the third party and recover the same from
the insured.
6.     Per  contra,  learned   counsel   for the   Insurance
Company would vehemently contend that Section 39 of the MV
Act is very clear that no person shall drive any motor vehicle and
no owner of a motor vehicle shall cause or permit the vehicle to
be driven in any public place or in any other place unless the
vehicle is registered in accordance with this Chapter and the
certificate of registration of the vehicle has not been suspended
or cancelled and the vehicle carries a registration mark displayed
in the prescribed manner.
7.     The learned counsel for the Insurance Company
referring Section 39 of the MV Act would contend that when such
prohibition is made under the MV Act, the Insurance Company is
not liable to pay the compensation. The learned counsel would
contend the Yellavva case (supra) cannot be applied to the case
on hand and it is an admitted fact that as on the date of the
accident, the temporary registration of the vehicle was expired
and hence the question of shifting the liability does not arise.
The learned counsel submits that the insured has not filed any
appeal challenging the judgment and award of the Tribunal. The
learned counsel contend that the question of directing to pay and
recover does not arise since it is a fundamental breach.
8.    Having heard the respective learned counsel and also
on perusal of the material available on record, the points that
arise for the consideration of this Court are:
(i)   Whether the Tribunal has committed an error
in    not   awarding      just   and   reasonable
compensation as contended in the appeal?
(ii)  Whether the Tribunal has committed an error
in fastening the liability on the insured instead
of insurer as contended in the appeal?
9.    It is the claim of the claimant that he met with an
accident when he was proceeding towards his office and the
driver of the Tata Ace caused the accident and as a result, he
had sustained grievous injuries and he was shifted to C.G.
Hospital,    Davanagere     and     thereafter   to   S.S.  Hospital,
Davanagere and also he took treatment at Kasturba Hospital,
Manipal as an inpatient.    It is also his claim that he was earning
Rs.6,501/- per month by working in BSS Micro Finance Pv.t Ltd.,
but due to the impact of the accident, he became permanently
disabled.    The accident in question was alleged to have been
occurred on account of the negligence on the part of the driver
of the Tata Ace.       The claimant in support of his contention
examined himself as P.W.1 and also examined the doctor as
P.W.2 to substantiate his claim of disability and another witness
as P.W.3 and got marked the documents at Exs.P.1 to 51. On
the other hand, the respondent examined three witnesses as
R.W.1 to R.W.3 and got marked the temporary registration
certificate as Ex.R.1, copy of the policy as Ex.R.2, certified copy
of ‘B’ register extract as Ex.R.3, certified copy of RC extract as
Ex.R.4     and certified copy of F.C. extract as Ex.R.5.        The
Tribunal after considering the material available on record comes
to the conclusion that the temporary registration of the vehicle
was expired and as on the date of the accident, there was no
registration certificate.
10.    Having perused the wound certificate, which is
marked as Ex.P.6, it discloses that he had suffered right
proximal humerus fracture and there was a lacerated wound
over the knee and there was a fracture of C1 and C2. The same
is evident from the treatment summary issued by Kasturba
Hospital, which are marked as Exs.P.8 and 9.               Having
considered Exs.P.8 and 9, it is clear that he had suffered
humerus fracture and fracture of C1 and C2. When such being
the case, it is appropriate to award an amount of Rs.50,000/-
as against Rs.30,000/- under the head pain and suffering.
11.   The Tribunal awarded an amount of Rs.45,000/-
under the head medical expenses, diet, nourishment and
attendant charges. On perusal of the medical bills, which have
been marked as Exs.P.12 to 37, it amounts to Rs.37,765.61/-
towards purchase of drugs and medicines and the same have not
been disputed.    He was hospitalized in Kasturba Hospital from
22.01.2011 to 12.03.2011 and as per Ex.P.8, he was once again
hospitalized in the same hospital from 01.06.2011 to 24.06.2011
and once again he was admitted on 07.07.2012 and the Tribunal
failed to take note of the period of treatment and awarded only
Rs.7,000/- under the head food and nourishment, attendant
charges, conveyance charges and the medical bills amounts to
Rs.37,765/-. In all, granted an amount of Rs.45,000/-. Taking
note of the medical bills produced, it is appropriate to award an
amount of Rs.50,000/- under the head medical expenses and
an amount of Rs.13,000/- under the head conveyance,
attendant charges and other incidental expenses since he was an
inpatient for one month 19 days at the first instance and in the
second instance for a period of 23 days.
12.    The Tribunal awarded an amount of Rs.20,000/-
under the head loss of income during the laid up period and he
had suffered fracture of humerus and fracture of C1 and C2 and
he was in the hospital for more than 2½ months.         It was an
accident of the year 2011 and the notional income would be
Rs.6,500/-    per   month.  Having    considered  the     fractures
sustained, it requires minimum six months for uniting of fracture
and for rest. Hence, taking the income of Rs.6,500/- per month
and laid up period as six months, the loss of income during the
laid up period comes to Rs.39,000/- (Rs.6,500/- x 6).
13.    The Tribunal awarded an amount of Rs.1,72,800/-
under the head loss of future income on account of permanent
physical disability. The doctor assessed the disability of 60% to
particular limb and the Tribunal considering 1/3rd of it, rightly
taken the disability of 20% to the whole body.         Taking the
income of Rs.6,500/- per month, disability of 20% to the whole
body and applying the relevant multiplier of ‘18’ as he was aged
about   22   years,   the   loss  of future   income   comes    to
Rs.2,80,800/- Rs.6,500/- x 12 x 18 x 20%).
14.   The Tribunal awarded an amount of Rs.20,000/-
under the head loss of amenities and enjoyment of life and the
compensation awarded is on the lesser side since he is aged
about 22 years and he has to lead rest of his life with disability
of 20% and hence it is appropriate to enhance the same to
Rs.30,000/- as against Rs.20,000/-.
15.   In all, the claimant is entitled for compensation of
Rs.4,62,800/- as against Rs.2,88,000/-.
16.   Now coming to the aspect of liability is concerned,
the Tribunal while answering issue No.4, comes to the conclusion
that on the date of the accident, the temporary registration was
expired and records also discloses that FC was valid from
18.11.2011 to 20.01.2013 for a period of two years since the
vehicle was a new vehicle. It is the contention of the Insurance
Company that as on the date of the registration of the vehicle as
per  Ex.R.4,  21.01.2011,     it had  no   FC.    The  temporary
registration certificate would be issued only after verifying the
FC. The non-registration of the offending vehicle as on the date
of the accident is an undisputed fact and the vehicle had no
permanent registration and the temporary registration was also
expired.    The main contention of the learned counsel for the
claimant is that even if there is a fundamental breach, if the
injured is a third party, in view of the judgment of this Court in
the case of Yellavva (supra), the Insurance Company is liable to
pay the third party and recover the same from the insured even
if there is breach of any condition recognized under Section
149(2) of the MV Act.      On the other hand, it is the contention
of the Insurance Company that Section 39 of the MV Act
discloses with regard to the necessity of registration of the
17.   This Court would like to rely upon the judgment of
this Court in the case of SRI RAJA LINGAIAH v. SRI MANJU
@ MANJA AND ANOTHER reported in 2014 SCC Online KAR
7099, wherein in paragraph No.4 in a similar circumstance of
expiry of the temporary registration, observed that on the date
of   the   accident,  the  registration  certificate was  expired.
However, the insurance certificate was in force. The Insurance
Company, while issuing certificate of insurance, was aware that
the insured vehicle had registration certificate only for a period
of 30 days. If it was the intention of the Insurance Company to
cover the risk of the vehicle during the currency of registration
certificate, the Insurance Company should have issued the policy
covering the risk of the vehicle till the date of expiry of the
registration certificate. It should have been specifically stated in
the certificate that certificate of insurance policy would be
effective as long as registration certificate is current.       The
Insurance Company having received the premium for one year
cannot contend that it is not liable to pay the compensation,
more particularly when the claim is made by a third party.
18.    The Division Bench of this Court in the case of
ORIENTAL        INSURANCE       COMPANY     LIMITED       v.  SMT.
SAVITHRI HUDGE AND ANOTHER reported in 2014 SCC
Online KAR 12505, while answering point No.1, considered the
material on record and held that, if there is breach of the terms
and condition of policy, issued by the insurer, then, it is very
much open for it to proceed against the owner of the offending
vehicle and it is not justifiable for the insurer to shirk its
responsibility from indemnifying the injured claimant, on the
ground that the vehicle was not duly registered as on the date of
the accident and extracted the provisions of Section 149 of the
MV Act and held that the insurer is liable to indemnify the award
and thereafter recover the same from the owner, if there is
breach or violation of terms and conditions of the policy, in
accordance with law.
19.   The Madras High Court in its judgment in the case of
v. VALLI AND OTHERS reported in 2020 SCC Online Madras
5214, in paragraph No.5 discussed with regard to the contention
of the Insurance Company that the insured vehicle was not
having valid registration on the date of the accident and there
was breach of policy terms and violation of provisions of Motor
Vehicles Act.   Having considered the material on record, held
that on the date of the accident on 06.12.2011, the vehicle had
no valid registration number. It amounts to violation of Motor
Vehicles Act. However, the Insurance Company is bound to pay
the claimants and to recover the same from the owner.
20.   Having considered the principles laid down in the
judgments of this Court and Madras High Court referred supra
and also considering the material facts of the case on hand,
admittedly the claimant is a third party and Tata Ace driver
drove the vehicle in a rash and negligent manner and dashed
against the claimant. This Court in the case of Raja Lingaiah
(supra), held that the Insurance Company having received the
premium for one year cannot contend that it is not liable to pay
the compensation, more particularly when the claim is made by
a third party.  The Division Bench of this Court in the case of
SAVITHRI HUDGE (supra), held that the Insurance Company
has to indemnify the claimant and recover the same from the
insured.   The Madras High Court in the case of VALLI (supra)
held that the Insurance Company is bound to pay the claimants
and to recover the same from the owner.      Hence point (ii) is
answered accordingly that the Insurance Company has to
indemnify the claimant and recover the same from the insured.
21.   In view of the discussions made above, I pass the
(i)   The appeal is allowed in part.
(ii)  The impugned judgment and award of the
Tribunal      20.04.2013,          passed        in
M.V.C.No.717/2011,      is    modified    granting
compensation of Rs.4,62,800/-           as against
Rs.2,88,000/-, with interest at 7% per annum
from the date of petition till deposit.
(iii) The Insurance Company is directed to pay the
compensation amount with interest within six
weeks from today and recover the same from
the insured.
(iv)  The Registry is directed to transmit the records
to the concerned Tribunal, forthwith.
