6/04.05.2022           This petition has been heard through Video Conferencing in
view of the guidelines of the High Court taking into account the situation
arising due to COVID-19 pandemic. None of the parties have complained
about any technical snag of audio-video and with their consent this
matter has been heard.
This petition has been filed for quashing the order dated
23.9.2017 passed in Criminal Revision No.30 of 2017, whereby the
learned Sessions Judge, West Singhbhum at Chaibasa has been pleased
to dismiss the criminal revision preferred by the petitioner on the ground
that the petitioner was not a party to the proceeding in connection with
which the revision application was preferred and also for quashing the
order dated 09.5.2017 passed in Misc. Case No.57 of 2016 instituted in
terms of section 107 of the Cr.P.C whereby learned Sub Divisional
Magistrate, Sadar, Chaibasa has been pleaded to direct the Circle Officer
to effect delivery of possession of the property in question in favour of
the O.P.nos.2 and 3.
Mr. Krishany Ray, the learned counsel appearing on behalf
of the petitioner submits that a proceeding under section 107 Cr.P.C was
instituted on 22.09.2016 against the O.P.no.3 by O.P.no.2. He submits
that that the petitioner is owner of the land in question as he has
purchased the land in question from O.P.no.3 vide sale deed dated
31.08.2015 contained at Annexure-1 to the petition. He submits that
order has been passed under section 107 Cr.P.C by which possession has
been put into to the O.P.No.2. he submits that, that power is not there to
the learned Magistrate to put into possession. By way of referring section
107 Cr.P.C, he submits that the learned court is only required to look into
that if any breach of peace or any disturbance is there, he can order to
execute a bond for one year only and by the impugned order the
possession has been given to the O.P.no.2. He submits that it is not in
the light of section 107 Cr.P.C. He further submits that section 107 Cr.P.C
was considered by the Hon’ble Supreme Court in the case of “Madhu
Limaye v. Sub-Divisional Magistrate”, (1970) 3 SCC 746 and he relied on
paragraph nos.32, 33 and 35 of the said judgment, which are quoted
“32. The gist of Section 107 may now be given. It
enables certain specified classes of Magistrates to
make an order calling upon a person to show cause
why he should not be ordered to execute a bond,
with or without sureties for keeping the peace for
such period not exceeding one year as the
Magistrate thinks fit to fix. The condition of taking
action is that the Magistrate is informed and he is of
opinion that there is sufficient ground for
proceeding that a person is likely to commit a
breach of the peace or disturb the public tranquilly
or to do any wrongful act that may probably
occasion a breach of the peace or disturb the public
tranquillity. The Magistrate can proceed if the
person is within his jurisdiction or the place of the
apprehended breach of the peace or disturbance is
within the local limits of his jurisdiction. The section
empowered to take action, to record his reason for
acting, and then to order the arrest of the person (if
not already in custody or before the court) with a
empowered to deal with the case, together with a
copy of his reasons. The Magistrate before whom
such a person is sent may in his discretion detain
such person in custody pending further action by
33. The section is aimed at persons who cause a
reasonable apprehension of conduct likely to lead to
a breach of the peace or disturbance of the public
tranquillity. This is an instance of preventive justice
which the courts are intended to administer. This
provision like the preceding one is in aid of orderly
society and seeks to nip in the bud conduct
subversive of the peace and public tranquillity. For
this purpose Magistrates are invested with large
judicial discretionary powers for the preservation of
public peace and order. Therefore the justification
for such provisions is claimed by the State to be in
the function of the State which embraces not only
the punishment of offenders but, as far as possible,
the prevention of offences.
35. We have seen the provisions of Section 107.
That section says that action is to be taken ‘in the
manner hereinafter provided’ and this clearly
indicates that it is not open to a Magistrate in such a
case to depart from the procedure to any substantial
extent. This is very salutary because the liberty of
the person is involved and the law is rightly
solicitous, that this liberty should only be curtailed
according to its own procedure and not according to
the whim of the Magistrate concerned. It behoves
us, therefore, to emphasise the safeguards built into
the procedure because from there will arise the
consideration of the reasonableness of the
restrictions in the interest of public order or in the
interest of the general public.”
Looking to section 107 Cr.P.C., it is crystal clear that the
Magistrate can proceed if the person is within his jurisdiction or the place
of the apprehended breach of the peace or disturbance is within the local
limits of his jurisdiction and only to that effect the Magistrate can pass
the order under section 107 Cr.P.C. Under section 107 Cr.P.C., the
Magistrate is not empowered to put possession to any person and it is
done by order dated 09.5.2017 which is not the spirit of section 107
Cr.P.C. The entire order sheet has been annexed with the petition and it
transpires that the case was registered on 22.9.2016 and by the next
order dated 09.05.2017 without calling to file show cause on behalf of
the other parties, the order has been passed which is again without
following the due process of law as without considering the show cause
the said order has been passed. The order is passed without jurisdiction.
If any illegality is going on, the said cannot be allowed to continue
further. In revisional order the learned court has dismissed the petition
on the ground that the petitioner is barred by time and the petitioner is
not party in the proceeding. The sale deed annexed with the petition
suggest that the petitioner has purchased the land in question. It was
incumbent upon the O.P.No.2 to made the petitioner party in the petition
which has not been done by the O.P.no.2 and in absence of the petitioner
the order has been passed that does not mean that the petitioner is not
entitled to challenge the said order if the right is being infringed in such a
Accordingly, impugned orders dated 23.9.2017 passed in
Criminal Revision No.30 of 2017 passed by learned Sessions Judge, West
Singhbhum at Chaibasa and 09.05.2017 passed in Misc. Case No.57 of
2016 passed by learned Sub Divisional Magistrate, Sadar, Chaibasa are
set aside.
Cr.M.P. No.1045 of 2018 is allowed and disposed of.
I.A., if any, also stands disposed of.
