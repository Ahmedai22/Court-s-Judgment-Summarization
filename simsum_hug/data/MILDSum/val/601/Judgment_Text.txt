2.Aggrieved by the same, the present appeal is laid before this
Court. When the appeal came up for hearing, the learned counsel for the
appellants pointed out the facts that in this case, when the matter came up
for arguments on 08.12.2020, the learned counsel representing the
accused was not present and without hearing the arguments on behalf of
the accused and without appointing any Amicus Curiae, the Trial Court
proceeded to hear the learned Public Prosecutor and decided the issue
and found the accused guilty. Therefore, in the absence of any counsel
representing the accused and as there was nobody to represent the
perspectives of the accused, therefore, the conviction is erroneous. In
support of his submissions, the learned counsel relied on the judgments
of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Mohd.Sukur Ali Vs. State
of Assam reported in (2011) 4 SCC 729, K.S.Panduranga Vs. State of
Karnataka reported in (2013) 3 SCC 721 and the latest judgment of the
Hon'ble Supreme Court in Subedar Vs. State of Uttar Pradesh reported
in (2020) 17 SCC 765. He would submit that therefore, in view of the
CRL.A.No.295 of 2021
above judgments, it is the right of the accused to be represented by a
counsel and without the counsel being heard, the decision made by the
trial Court is liable to be set aside.
3.The learned counsel brought to the notice of the Court that there
is yet another factor that on behalf of the appellants/accused, an
application was filed under Section 311 Cr.P.C., to recall some of the
witnesses, who are not cross examined originally.        The Trial Court
allowed the said application with a condition to deposit a sum of
Rs.50,00,000/- and later, the same was dismissed as the condition was
not complied.      The same was challenged by filing a petition under
Section 482 Cr.P.C. before this Court and this Court also confirmed the
same. Even though the appellants/accused had filed an appeal by way of
a Special Leave Petition before the Hon'ble Supreme Court, before the
same could be numbered, the judgment was pronounced and therefore, he
would pray that the matter to be remanded back to the Trial Court with
an opportunity to cross examine the witnesses, who are not already cross
4.It is also brought to the notice of this Court by the learned
CRL.A.No.295 of 2021
counsel for the appellants that pending disposal of the above appeal and
pending disposal of the suspension of sentence petition, this Court
directed the accused to surrender before the Trial Court, pursuant to
which, the appellants/accused had surrendered before the trial Court on
29.11.2021 and are under custody. He would submit that the accused
were on bail when the trial was conducted and therefore, he would urge
that appropriate orders should also be passed for enlarging the
appellants/accused on bail in the event of remanding the matter back to
the trial Court.
5.Per contra, the learned Government Advocate (Crl.Side) would
submit that the Trial Court had in paragraph 31 cited about the repeated
opportunities granted to the appellants/accused from the month of March
2020 onwards and only because the counsel for the appellants was
continuously absent and did not avail the various opportunities of
physical hearing, hearing through video conference, making written
submissions through email etc., the Trial Court was finally forced to
decide the matter on 08.12.2021, by hearing the learned Public
Prosecutor alone. Therefore, the learned Government Advocate would
submit that even as per the Hon'ble Supreme Court's judgment produced
CRL.A.No.295 of 2021
by the learned counsel for the appellants in K.S.Panduranga Vs. State
of Karnataka reported in (2013) 3 SCC 721 cited supra, when it is the
deliberate attempt made by the counsel for the accused, the course
adopted by the trial Court cannot be found fault with.
6.He would submit that in any event the application for recalling
the witnesses has become final and has been confirmed by this Court in
exercise of its powers under Section 482 Cr.P.C. He would further
submit that in this case, it is not that the appellants/accused prayer was
not allowed, but they were permitted to deposit a sum of Rs.50,00,000/-
which cannot be termed as onerous condition given for the offences
under the TNPID Act. The balance amount outstanding is Rs.2crores as
per the final report and as a matter of fact, the Trial Court itself has in its
judgment found that a sum of Rs.1,10,00,000/- (Rupees one crore and ten
lakhs) is further due and the compensation has been awarded. He would
further submit, in view of the deliberate protracting of the proceedings,
appropriate conditions to be imposed, if they were to be released on bail
pending the remand.
7.By way of a reply, the learned counsel submitted that only
CRL.A.No.295 of 2021
because the judgment was pronounced, the appeal against the order
arising of 311 application was not moved. Even taking into account the
amount as determined by the Trial Court, a sum of Rs.50,00,000/- would
be onerous. The learned counsel for the appellants would on instructions
submit that the appellants are ready to deposit a sum of Rs.20,00,000/-
(Rs.10,00,000/- each) for the purpose of bail in the event of this Court
remanding the matter back to the Trial Court.
8.Considered the rival submissions on either side and perused the
material records in this case. Admittedly, it is seen that the Trial Court
did not hear any counsel on behalf of the accused persons. Neither the
counsel on record of the accused were present for final hearing and
argued the case and neither an Amicus Curiae was appointed.              But
however, the Trial Court has recorded the various opportunities given to
the learned counsel for the accused and according to the Trial Court, the
absence of the learned counsel was deliberate in nature. But, however,
the learned counsel appearing for the appellants would submit before this
Court that it was not deliberate, but only because of the pandemic
situation. He would submit that the concept of video conference was
working very well at the High Court level but not in the District Courts
CRL.A.No.295 of 2021
and as the counsel were not accustomed and used to the same. The
period in question was in the peak of pandemic situation, even the
movements were restricted by getting entry passes. Therefore, he would
submit that the absence is not deliberate in nature. In this regard, it is
necessary to advert to the pronouncement of the judgment by the Hon'ble
Supreme Court. Firstly, in the judgment in Mohd.Sukur Ali Vs. State
of Assam the Hon'ble Supreme Court recognized the right of the accused
to be represented by a counsel as part of Articles 21 and 22 and after
referring to the various decisions in this regard, finally, held in paragraph
”We reiterate that in the absence of a counsel, for
whatever reasons, the case should not be decided forthwith
against the accused but in such a situation the Court should
appoint a counsel who is practising on the criminal side as
amicus curiae and decide the case after fixing another date
and hearing him. If on the next date of hearing the counsel,
who ought to have appeared on the previous date but did not
appear, now appears, but cannot show sufficient cause for
his non-appearance on the earlier date, then he will be
precluded from appearing and arguing the case on behalf of
the accused. But, in such a situation, it is open to the
accused to either engage another counsel or the Court may
proceed with the hearing of the case by the counsel
CRL.A.No.295 of 2021
But, however, the above judgment came up for consideration
before the Hon'ble Supreme Court in K.S.Panduranga Vs. State of
Karnataka referred above supra, in which, the Honb'le Supreme Court
held that the dictum laid down in Bani Singh Vs. State of U.P. reported
in (1996) 4 SCC 720 by three Judge Bench will prevail and held that the
dictum in the said case is as follows:
”19. From the aforesaid decision, the principles
that can be culled out are:
19.1.That the High Court cannot dismiss an
appeal    for  non-     prosecution   simpliciter  without
examining the merits;
19.2. That the Court is not bound to adjourn the
matter if both the appellant or his counsel/lawyer are
19.3. That the court may, as a matter of prudence
or indulgence, adjourn the matter but it is not bound to
19.4. That it can dispose of the appeal after
perusing the record and judgment of the trial court;
19.5. That if the accused is in jail and cannot, on
his own, come to court, it would be advisable to adjourn
the case and fix another date to facilitate the
appearance of the accused-appellant if his lawyer is not
CRL.A.No.295 of 2021
present, and if the lawyer is absent and the court deems
it appropriate to appoint a lawyer at the State expense
to assist it, nothing in law would preclude the court from
19.6. That if the case is decided on merits in the
absence of the appellant, the higher court can remedy
the situation”.
9.Therefore, the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the above judgment
held that in view of the same, the judgment of the case Mohd.Sukur Ali
Vs. State of Assam goes contrary to the pronouncement and is in direct
conflict to the judgment laid in Bani Singh Vs. State of U.P. case. It is
useful to extract the paragraph no.26 and the findings in paragraph no.32.
”26.Regard being had to the principles pertaining
to binding precedent, there is no trace of doubt that the
principle laid down in Mohd. Sukur Ali (supra) by the
learned Judges that the court should not decide a
criminal case in the absence of the counsel of the
accused as an accused in a criminal case should not
suffer for the fault of his counsel and the court should, in
such a situation, must appoint another counsel as amicus
curiae to defend the accused and further if the counsel
does not appear deliberately, even then the court should
not decide the appeal on merit is not in accord with the
pronouncement by the larger Bench in Bani Singh
CRL.A.No.295 of 2021
(supra). It, in fact, is in direct conflict with the ratio laid
down in Bani Singh (supra). As far as the observation to
the effect that the court should have appointed amicus
curiae is in a different realm. It is one thing to say that
the court should have appointed an amicus curiae and it
is another thing to say that the court cannot decide a
criminal appeal in the absence of a counsel for the
accused and that too even if he deliberately does not
appear or shows a negligent attitude in putting his
appearance to argue the matter. With great respect, we
are disposed to think, had the decision in Bani Singh
(supra) been brought to the notice of the learned Judges,
the view would have been different.
32.In view of the aforesaid enunciation of law, it
can safely be concluded that the dictum in Mohd.Sukur
Ali (supra) to the effect that the court cannot decide a
criminal appeal in the absence of counsel for the
accused and that too if the counsel does not appear
deliberately or shows negligence in appearing, being
contrary to the ratio laid down by the larger Bench in
Bani Singh (supra), is per incuriam. We may hasten to
clarify that barring the said aspect, we do not intend to
say anything on the said judgment as far as engagement
of amicus curiae or the decision rendered regard being
CRL.A.No.295 of 2021
had to the obtaining factual matrix therein or the role of
the Bar Association or the lawyers. Thus, the contention
of the learned counsel for the appellant that the High
Court should not have decided the appeal on its merits
without the presence of the counsel does not deserve
acceptance. That apart, it is noticeable that after the
judgment was dictated in open court, the counsel
appeared and he was allowed to put forth his
submissions and the same have been dealt with”.
(Emphasis supplied)
The Hon'ble Supreme Court held that the judgment in
Mohd.Sukur Ali Vs. State of Assam is per incuriam but, however,
restricted with only in respect of the findings that the Court cannot
proceed in the matter, in case of the deliberate absence of the counsel
alone. They specifically held that it is another thing to say that an
Amicus curiae should have been appointed thereafter.
10.The Hon'ble Supreme Court of India by a three Judge Bench in
Subedar Vs. State of Uttar Pradesh reported in (2020) 17 SCC 765 has
“5.It is well accepted that right of being
represented through a counsel is part of due process
clause and is referable to the right guaranteed under
CRL.A.No.295 of 2021
6.In case the advocate representing the cause of
the accused, for one reason or the other was not
available, it was open to the Court to appoint an Amicus
Curiae to assist the Court but the cause in any case
ought not to be allowed to go unrepresented”.
11.Therefore, from the combined reading of the aforementioned
judgments, it would be clear that right of the accused to be represented
by a counsel has been held to be an integral part under Article 21 of the
Constitution of India though the Court may not be helpless and
proceeded further when the counsel for the accused is absent, still, it is
seen that there must be an Advocate to represent the cause of the accused
even if the learned counsel for the accused is absent for any reason. In
that view of the matter, I hold that the procedure adopted by the Trial
Court in not even appointing an Amicus Curiae to represent the accused
and hear the said Amicus Curiae before pronouncement of the judgment
is not a correct procedure and therefore, the valuable right of the accused
which is held to be a part of Article 21 of Constitution of India is
violated. In view thereof, I am of the view that the judgment of the Trial
Court has to be set aside and the matter has to be remanded back to the
Trial Court for fresh consideration.
12.As far as the question of recalling the witnesses is concerned,
the same has already attained finality. The Trial Court dismissed the
application for non compliance of condition and the same was also
upheld by this Court. Therefore, there is no question of permitting any
recall application by this Court while remanding the matter back. It is
made clear that only on the dictum of the Hon'ble Supreme Court that the
accused is entitled to be heard through a counsel, this matter is remanded
back and therefore, remanding is only to the stage of arguments by both
side counsel afresh.
13.Now it is seen that the appellants are in prison. Therefore,
when this Court is remanding back the matter to the Trial Court, this
Court is of the view that upon deposit of a sum of Rs.10,00,000/- each by
the appellants, it is a fit case to enlarge them on bail pending fresh
decision of the Trial Court in this case. Therefore, this Criminal Appeal
is allowed on the following terms:
(i) The    judgment of the Special Judge, Special Court under
TNPID Act, Coimbatore, dated 11.12.2020, in C.C.No.07 of 2014,
convicting and sentencing the appellants is set aside;
CRL.A.No.295 of 2021
(ii) C.C.No.07 of 2014 is remanded back to the file of the Special
Judge, Special Court under TNPID Act, Coimbatore to be continued
from the stage of arguments by both side counsel;
(iii) The next date of hearing is fixed on 01.08.2022. It is directed
that the accused to be present in Court for the hearing of the appeal on
the said date and it would be open for the accused to engage a counsel of
their choice and they shall argue the matter on the date fixed by the Trial
Court. If the learned counsel appointed by the accused is not appearing,
the Trial Court may appoint any counsel through the legal aid cell as
Amicus Curiae and hear the said learned counsel and pass appropriate
orders in the manner known to law;
(iv) The appellants 2 and 3 shall be enlarged on bail on condition
of their depositing a sum of Rs.10,00,000/- each to the credit of
(v) The Trial Court shall complete the exercise on or before
(vi) It will be open for the accused if they want to settle the claims
before that period and compound the issue, if they are ready to do so.
14.With the above observations, the criminal appeal is allowed.
CRL.A.No.295 of 2021
Consequently, connected miscellaneous petitions are also closed.
