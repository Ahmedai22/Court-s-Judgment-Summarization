Case :- HABEAS CORPUS WRIT PETITION No. - 402 of 2022
[1]          Heard Sri Manish Dwivedi, learned counsel for the
petitioner as well as Sri Ghanshyam Kumar and Sri Mohd. Afzal,
learned counsels appearing for the State and perused the records of
the case.
[2]          At the outset, learned A.G.A. has raised strong
preliminary objection with regard to the maintainibility of the
present Habeas Corpus petition and floated certain arguments
against this petition, which would be considered in the later part of
the judgment.
[3]          From the petition, Sri Dwivedi, learned counsel for the
petitioner has sought following prayer mentioned hereinbelow viz:-
“a) Issue a writ, order or direction in the nature of Habeas
Corpus direction the respondent no.2 to produce the corpus-
Km. Poonam from the custody of respondent no.4(Manish
Kumar Sharma) before this Hon'ble Court to ensure his safety
b) Issue any other suitable writ, order or direction, as this
Hon'ble Court may deem fit and proper in the facts and
circumstances of the case.
c)     Award cost of this petition in favour of the petitioner.”
In this petition, Ms. Poonam Kushwaha(25 years) is
the daughter of Kailash Chandra Kushwaha who in fact, is the
“petitioner no.2” has arrayed (i) State of U.P. Principal Secretary,
Homes, Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh; (ii) Superintendent of Polilce,
Kumar Sharma aged 29 years s/o Rajesh Sharma, r/o village-
Talahati, police station-Kalinger, District-Banda, as respondents
from whom he has sought aforementioned prayer.
[4]           The bare skelton fact which has given rise to the
present Habeas Corpus petition are formulated hereinbelow :-
(A) Submission advanced by learned counsel for the
petitioner no.2 is that Kailash Chandra Kushwaha, has lodged the
FIR on 24.01.2022 for the alleged act of enticement of his daughter
Poonam Kushwaha on 22.01.2022 from Kalinger. This FIR was got
registered as case crime no.25 of 2022 under section 366 IPC at
(B) On account of certain misconceptions and mis-
information received to the informant, initially the FIR was
registered against one Biru Prajapati, but later on, it was revealed to
the informant that a person Rohit Bhatt@Manish Kumar Sharma,
after hatching the conspiracy with one Afsar, Chand Khan and two
others, has forcibly taken away Km. Poonam Kushwaha(24 years)
from the custody of her father/petitioner no.2. Consequently, an
application was moved on the same day i.e 24.01.2022 itself to the
concerned Investigating Officer giving the correct information
about the real offenders.
(C) During the pendency of the investigation, petitioner
no.2 came to know that Rohit Bhatt@Manish Kumar Sharma
carried her daughter to the Bench of this Hon'ble Court seeking
civil protection, projecting that both of them are major and now are
married couple and thus, their future may be secured by giving
certain civil protection to them, accordingly, a Civil Writ Petition
No.3002 of 2022 was filed by them and on 17.02.2022, co-ordinate
Bench of this Court while relying upon the judgments of Lata
Singh Vs. State of U.P. 2006 Cr.L.J. 3312 and Bhagwan Das Vs.
NCT, New Delhi,(2011) 6 SCC 396 disposed of the aforesaid
petition protecting the interest of the couple with certain
(D) The father of the corpus Mr. Kailash Chandra
Kushwaha also came to know that his daughter Poonam Kushwaha
got married with respondent no.4.
(E) In the present petition, father has levelled all sorts
of severe allegations about the nature and character of respondent
no.4 that after laying love trap, Rohit Bhatt@Manish Kumar
Sharma spoiled the life of many other young girls, were trapped in
his love and thereafter, utilized them for women trafficking and
thrown them into flesh market etc.
(F) Raising all his suspicion, father of the girl moved
an application on 04.04.2022, raising his grievance regarding his
daughter before the Superintendent of Police, Banda but it seems
that no heed was paid on the said letter. In addition to this in
paragraph no.12 of the petition, it is also alleged that informant's
wife Ram Janki(mother of Poonam Kushwaha) has received phone
calls allegedly from Manish Bhatt@Manish Kumar Sharma
demanding Rs.5 lacs for the safety and security of the kidnapee Ms.
Poonam Kushwaha. Perturbed by this, Ram Janki too made an
application to the concerned S.H.O., Kalinger on 09.05.2022 but
that application too gone into deaf ear of concerned S.H.O.
In paragraph no.14 of the petition, on 24.01.2022,
Manish Kumar Sharma and Poonam Kushwaha got married but this
marriage was never accepted by her parent. The marriage
certificate is from Ram Janki Mandir, Prayagraj dated 24.01.2022
certified by one Acharya Vijay Shashtri annexed as Annexure-8 to
the petition.
[5]           The petitioner/father was anxious to know about the
well-being of his daughter and it is the petitioner who also received
unconfirmed information that her daughter may be carried way
outside the country and on this ground, it is prayed that S.P.
Banda(respondent no.2) was directed to produce the corpus of
Poonam Kushwaha from the custody of respondent no.4-Manish
Kumar Sharma to ensure the safety and security of her life so that
justice could be done during the pendency of the present petition.
Interestingly, in the entire writ petition, there is not
even a whisper, that his daughter was in the illegal confinement of
respondent no.4 or she has been kept forcibly against her wish with
respondent no.4.
[6]          After hearing these factual submissions advanced by
learned counsel for the petitioner, learned A.G.A. relying upon the
instructions received from the S.H.O. Kalinger, Banda have pointed
out that pursuant to the FIR as case crime no.25 of 2022 under
section 366 IPC, police station-Kalinger dated 24.01.2022, the
investigation is still going on with full swing. It is the informant
who has initially lodged the FIR againt one Biru Prajapati and later
on, gave an application, have replaced him by inserting Manish
Kumar Sharma. During investigation, it has come to the knowledge
of the Investigating Agency that the aforesaid couple have
solemnized marriage in some temple at Prayagraj and appeared
before the Court for having a civil protection by means of Writ-C
No.3002 of 2022 and vide order dated 17.02.2022, the single
Bench of this Court has protected the interest of the couple with
certain conditions.
[7]          Besides this, petitioner no.1-Poonam Kushwaha on
27.02.2022 has given an application to the S.P. Banda annexing the
certified copy of the aforesaid order levelling specific allegations
against her own father, that petitioner no.2 Kailash Chandra
Kushwaha was planning to get her married with a person double of
her age. Meanwhile, she, on her own, contacted Manish Kumar
Sharma, respondent no.4 and both of them got married on
24.01.2022 at Prayagraj. This marriage was performed by them as
per their own sweet will without any coercion or duress from any
quarter and now, they are leading happy marital life.
However, as per the wild allegations levelled in
paragraph 12, 13, 15, 16 and 17 of the writ petition, that ransom of
Rs.five lacs were demanded on telephone of Ram Janki, mother of
Poonam Kushwaha is concerned, the police is examining all these
allegations in a thorough professional way and yet to file their
report under section 173(2) Cr.P.C.
Learned A.G.A. has accused the petitioner with regard
to the maintainability that by filing the present Habeas Corpus
petition, the father Kailash Chandra Kushwaha wants to exploit its
extra-ordinary power just to exert extra pressure on the police who
are in the midst of the investigation. It is further contended by
learned A.G.A. that this Habeas Corpus petition is nothing but a
device of arm twisting by involving the High Court in this ongoing
investigation thus, it is not only purposive but also misconceived.
[8]           It has been further contended that writ of Habeas
Corpus can only be issued when there is specific assertion in the
writ petition that the corpus is in the illegal captivity or wrongful
confinement of an individual against his/her wish and desire. In the
instant case, when the girl, major girl of 24 years, no doubt,
without any information to her parent, fled away with respondent
no.4 and she has allegedly solemnized marriage and happily
residing with him, it is a million dollar question as to whether she
could be considered in the illegal confinement of respondent no.4 ?
[9]           After hearing the rival parties, the father is asserting
that his daughter is being enticed away by respondent no.4 in the
dead hours of the night of 21/22.01.2022 whereas the other
documents especially Annexure-4 order in the writ petition Smt.
Poonam Kushwaha and ors. Vs. State of U.P., indicates that both of
them got married and leading a happy marital life. This is a precise
question of investigation. However, in this backdrop, the custody of
the victim being disputed, now it is the police who has to
investigate this factual issue that the corpus is residing with
respondent no.4 on her sweet will OR Manish Kumar Sharma
respondent no.4 is keeping her in his illegal captivity, against her
desire. This comes within exclusive domain of police to
sinvestigate into the matter.
After hearing the rival submission, the Court has
formulated following proposition of law for the judicial scrutiny,
Let us examine this instant prelimnary objection raised by
the learned A.G.A.
[10]         So      far   as  this   pertinent   question     regarding
maintainability of the present Habeas Corpus petition is concerned,
it is imperative to examine the meaning and scope of Habeas
Corpus petition from its historical background.
[11]         The Latin phrase habeas corpus means literally that
"you", that is, the person with custody over the prisoner, must
"have the body" of the prisoner produced in court at the place and
time ordered by a judge. The writ of habeas corpus provides
individuals with protection against arbitrary and wrongful
[12]                  The meaning of the term habeas corpus is "you must
have the body". In Halsbury Laws of England, 4th Edition, Vol.11,
p.1452, p.768, it is observed:
"The writ of habeas corpus ad subjiciendum" which is
commonly known as the writ of habeas corpus, is a
prerogative High Court process for securing the liberty of
the subject by affording an effective means of immediate
release from the unlawful or unjustifiable detention
whether in prison or in private custody. It is a prerogative
writ by which the queen has a right to inquire into the
causes for which any of her subjects are deprived of their
liberty. By it the High Court and the judges of that Court,
at the instance of a subject aggrieved, command the
production of that subject, and inquiry into the cause of
his imprisonment. If there is no legal justification for the
detention, the party is ordered to be released. Release on
habeas corpus is not, however, an acquittal, nor may the
writ be used as a means of appeal."
[13]          Habeas corpus ad subjiciendum means "that you have
the body to submit or answer."
May in his Constitutional History of England (1912),
Vol.II, p.130, described writ of habeas corpus as "the first security
of civil liberty". Blackstone called the writ of habeas corpus as
"the great and efficacious writ in all manner of illegal
confinement."
[14]          Julius Stone in Social Dimensions of Law and Justice,
(1966), p.203 described the writ of habeas corpus as a picturesque writ with
an extraordinary scope and flexibility High Court of an application.
[15]          According to Dicey (A.C. Dicey), Introduction to the Study of
Law of the Constitution, Macmillan and Co., Ltd., p.215(1915): "if, in
short, any man, woman or child is, or is asserted on apparently good
grounds to be deprived of liberty, the court will always issue a writ of
habeas corpus to anyone who has the aggrieved person in his custody to
have such person brought before the court and if he is suffering restraint
without lawful cause, set him free."
[16]          In Greene vs. Home Secretary, (1941) 3 All ER 388, it has
"Habeas corpus is a writ in the nature of an order
calling upon the person who has detained another to
produce the later before the court, in order to let the
court know on what ground he has been confined and
to set him free if there is no legal jurisdiction of
imprisonment."
[17]          The prerogative writ of habeas corpus ad subjiciendum
is the most renowned contribution of English common law to the
protection of human member.
In India, the jurisdiction to issue prerogative writs came
with the establishment of the Supreme Court by regulating Act of
1773. The charter of 1774 gave power to each High Court of the
justices of the Supreme Court of Calcutta to issue a writ of habeas
corpus. The three Supreme Courts in Calcutta, Bombay and Madras
by the Act of Parliament in 1861 were abolished and High Courts
were established and the power to issue writs of habeas corpus was
inherited by them. This power to issue writ of habeas corpus was
taken away from 1875 and new power of the High Court arose under
Section 491 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898 to issue
statutory directions in the nature of habeas corpus. By Articles 32
and 226, the Supreme Court and all the High Court got jurisdiction
to issue writ of habeas corpus throughout their respective territorial
jurisdiction when the Constitution came into force.
[18]         Considering the decision of the Constitution Bench,
recently the Apex Court in State Vs. H. Nilofer Nisha, since
reported in (2020) 14 SCC 161 has considered the expanding
scope of the writ of habeas corpus and has held as under :-
"16. A writ of habeas corpus can only be issued when the
detention or confinement of a person is without the
authority of law. Though the literal meaning of the Latin
phrase habeas corpus is "to produce the body", over a
period of time production of the body is more often than
not insisted upon but legally it is to be decided whether the
body is under illegal detention or not. Habeas corpus is
often used as a remedy in cases of preventive detention
because in such cases the validity of the order detaining
the detenu is not subject to challenge in any other court
and it is only writ jurisdiction which is available to the
aggrieved party. The scope of the petition of habeas corpus
has over a period of time been expanded and this writ is
commonly used when a spouse claims that his/her spouse
has been illegally detained by the parents. This writ is
many times used even in cases of custody of children.
Even though, the scope may have expanded, there are
certain limitations to this writ and the most basic of such
limitation is that the Court, before issuing any writ of
habeas corpus must come to the conclusion that the detenu
is under detention without any authority of law.”
[19]           Illegal confinement is the pre-condition to issue a writ
of habeas corpus. Though a writ of right, it is not a writ of course.
It is an extra ordinary remedy and cannot be granted on mere
asking. It cannot be resorted to in a casual and routine manner.
Who is responsible for kidnapping the son of the petitioner and
who is wrongfully confining him are maters of investigation and
definite opinion in this regard is lacking in the present case.
[20]           In a criminal investigation, what action should have
been taken by the police that cannot be a matter of habeas corpus
because there is no application whatsoever that there has been
wrongful confinement by the police.
Kora @ Suraj, (2007) 10 SCC 190 while explaining the nature of writ of
habeas corpus, the Supreme Court held that it is writ of right, it is not
a writ of course. The application must show a prima facie case of his
unlawful detention. Relevant para-7 of the judgment reads as under:
"7.Article 21 of the Constitution having declared that no person
shall be deprived of life and liberty except in accordance with
the procedure established by law, a machinery was definitely
needed to examine the question of illegal detention with utmost
promptitude. The writ of habeas corpus is a device of this
nature. Blackstone called it "the great and efficacious writ in all
manner of illegal confinement". The writ has been described as
a writ of right which is grantable ex debito justitiae. Though a
writ of right, it is not a writ of course. The applicant must show
a prima facie case of his unlawful detention. Once, however, he
shows such a cause and the return is not good and sufficient, he
is entitled to this writ as of right."
[21]           In Kanu Sanyal vs. Distt. Magistrate, (1973) 2 SCC
674 , the Supreme Court held that while dealing with a writ of
habeas corpus, the Supreme Court held that it is essentially a
procedural writ. It deals with the machinery of justice, not the
substantive law. The object of the writ is to secure release of a
person who is illegally restrained of his liberty.
[22]          In Swapan Das vs. the State of West Bengal & Ors.
2013 SCC Online Cal 11681, the High Court Calcutta held as
"A habeas corpus writ is to be issued only when the person
concerning whose liberty the petition has been filed is illegally
detained by a respondent in the petition. On the basis of a
habeas corpus petition the power under art.226 is not to be
exercised for tracing a missing person engaging an
investigating agency empowered to investigate a case under the
Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973. The investigation, if in
progress, is to be overseen by the criminal court. Here the
petitioner is High Court asking this court to direct the police to
track down his missing son. For these reasons, we dismiss the
writ petition."
[23]          Similarly, in Sulochana Bai vs. State of M.P. & Ors,
2008 (2) MPHT 233, the High Court of Madhya Pradesh observed
"12. We have referred to the aforesaid decisions only to
highlight that the writ of habeas corpus can only be issued when
there is assertion of wrongful confinement. In the present case,
what has been asserted in the writ petition is that her father-in-
law has been missing for last four years and a missing report
has been lodged at the Police Station. What action should have
been taken by the Police that cannot be the matter of habeas
corpus because there is no allegation whatsoever that there has
been wrongful confinement by the police or any private person.
In the result, the writ petition is not maintainable and is
accordingly dismissed."
[24]          In Selvaraj vs. the State, Rep. by the Superintendent
of Police, Nagapattinam District, in 2018(3) MLJ (Cri) 712, a
Division Bench of the Madras High Court observed as under:
The constitutional Courts across the country predominantly
held in catena of judgments that establishing a ground of
"illegal detention" and a strong suspicion about any such
"illegal detention" is a condition precedent for moving a
Habeas Corpus petition and the Constitutional Courts shall be
restrained in entertaining such Habeas Corpus petition, where
there is no allegation of "illegal detention" or suspicion about
any such "illegal detention". Man/Women missing cases cannot
be brought under the provision of the Habeas Corpus petition.
Man/Women missing cases are to be registered under the
regular provisions of the Indian Penal Code and the Police
officials concerned are bound to investigate the same in the
manner prescribed under the Code of Criminal Procedure. Such
cases are to be dealt as regular cases by the competent Court of
Law and the extraordinary jurisdiction of the Constitutional
Courts cannot be invoked for the purpose of dealing with such
Man/Women Missing cases.
To hold investigation in a cognizable offence is the statutory
right of the police. It is well settled that at the stage of
investigation the Court has no role to play. However, the
investigating agency is required to take all necessary steps to
conclude the investigation and submit its report to the
Magistrate concerned. If the police fail to perform their
statutory duty in accordance with law, the Court has a
bounden statutory obligation to ensure that the investigation is
conducted in accordance with law.
[25]         In Amar Nath Chaubey Vs. Union of India (SLP
(Cr.) no.6951 of 2018) by order dated 14 th December, 2020, a
three-Judge Bench of the Supreme Court observed as under :-
"8. The police has a statutory duty to investigate into any
crimein accordance with law as provided in the Code of
Criminal Procedure. Investigation is the exclusive privilege
and prerogative of the police which cannot be interfered with.
But if the police does not perform its statutory duty in
accordance with law or is remiss in the performance of its
duty, the court cannot abdicate its duties on the precocious
plea that investigation is the exclusive prerogative of the
police. Once the conscience of the court is satisfied, from the
materials on record, that the police has not investigated
properly or apparently is remiss in the investigation, the court
has a bounden constitutional obligation to ensure that the
investigation is conducted in accordance with law. If the court
gives any directions for that purpose within the contours of the
law, it cannot amount to interference with investigation. A fair
investigation is, but a necessary concomitant of Articles 14
and 21 of the Constitution of India and this Court has the
bounden obligation to ensure adherence by the police."
since reported in (2014) 2 SCC 532, the Supreme Court observed as under
“24. In the criminal justice system the investigation of an offence is the
domain of the police. The power to investigate into the cognizable
offences by the police officer is ordinarily not impinged by any fetters.
However, such power has to be exercised consistent with the statutory
provisions and for legitimate purpose. The courts ordinarily do not
interfere in the matters of investigation by police, particularly, when
the facts and circumstances do not indicate that the investigating
officer is not functioning bona fide. In very exceptional cases, however,
where the court finds that the police officer has exercised his
investigatory powers in breach of the statutory provision putting the
personal liberty and/or the property of the citizen in jeopardy by illegal
and improper use of the power or there is abuse of the investigatory
power and process by the police officer or the investigation by the
police is found to be not bona fide or the investigation is tainted with
animosity, the court may intervene to protect the personal and/or
property rights of the citizens.”
[27]          Now, in this backdrop of settled tenets of law with regard to
Habeas Corpus petition from its very inception, its historical background
and thereafter its gradual evolution by various court of law in India, one of
the basic and essential convenent that, an individual must be detained or
confined without any authority of law. Confinment means, “the state of
being forced to stay in prison or another place which one cannot leave”.
Thus the basic ingredient of illegal confinement or detention is forced stay
and against one's wish or desire. If a person is residing on his own sweet
free will or on his own volition, cannot be fall within realm of illegal
confinement, under these circumstances, Habeas Corpus Petition is simply
a futile exercise.
In the instant case, when both the victim(girl) and respondent
no.4 themselves reached to the Bench of this Court by filing a Writ C
No.3002 of 2022 and entertaining that writ, on 17.02.2022, Bench has
protected their interest that by no stretch of imagination, the girl is said to
be in illegal confinement or detention of respondent no.4. Not only this,
after obtaining the order from this Court, she has submitted the same by
giving a covering letter in her own writing to the concerned police station,
accusing her own father, that she was compelled to marry of a person
double of her age, an elderly person and thus, she on her own, decided to
fled away with the boy(respondent no.4) with whom she has got an early
acquaintance/friendship and a tender relationship and both of them have
decided to marry. Since, both of them were major, they decided to marry
with each other and now they are married couple. It seems that the parent
are against this marriage and that's why after concocting the facts of the
case, wants to involve the High Court to exert pressure upon the police, to
hold a futile exercise.
[28]          From above, this Court is of the strong opinion, that petitioner
no.2 invoking this extra-ordinary powers by way of Habeas Corpus
petition, when he has already lodged an FIR and the police is seized with
the matter. It is expected from the S.S.P. and S.H.O. Concern district and
police station to look into the matter with all their professional skills and
competence at the earliest, else the petitioner may explore other alternative
avenues from their redressal of grievance, but certainly not, the Habeas
Corpus Petition. In the instant Habeas Corpus Petition, there is not even a
whisper that the corpus has been kept forcibly by respondent no.4 against
her wish. In the absence of the basic pleadings in the petition, it lacks
merits and liable to be dismissed on this score alone.
[29]          In my view, filing of the present Habeas Corpus Petition is
nothing but an arm twisting of the local police officials who are already
engaged, after lodging of the FIR. This Court feels that after the girl is fled
away from the guardianship of her parent, it is their personal perception
that their son or daughter has been kept in the illegal captivity of the
offence. But, in majority of the cases, when these couples are brought
before the Court, after the notices, these couples ruthlessly blasts the
perception of their parent, resultantly, the Habeas Corpus Petition would
end into big zero and an exercise in vanity.
[30]          Rightly so, the Court too is of the considered opinion that
where the FIR with regard to alleged act of kidnapping, abduction or
illegal confinement or for ransom has already been filed and police
personnels are pursuing the matter at their end, the lodging of parallel
Habeas Corpus Petition is motivated and purposive one. By filing such
type of petitions, the impatient petitioner wants to involve the Courts to
exert their pressure upon the police to speed up their investigation. The
Habeas Corpus Petitions should not to be used as whip over the police to
officials, just to serve out the petition's vanity over the police.
[31]           Thus, after marshalling of facts and circumstances of the
instant case and the law in this regard, the preliminary objection raised by
learned A.G.A., finds force and accordingly instant Habeas Corpus
Petition is dismissed at the admission stage itself.
[32]           It is made clear that the ratio adopted in the present case shall
not apply in the case of minors because any amount of their consent or
willingness is not a valid consent in the eye of law and therefore, the
police report shall not be precluded in the matter of minors.
