Dated this the 31st day of January, 2022
This    Original  Petition    is   filed  under     Article 227 of
Constitution of India against an order passed by Family Court,
Ernakulam (for short ‘the court below’) on 25.10.2021 in
M.P.No.629/2021 in M.C.No.198/2021.                  The order assailed
“Taken up today. For objection. Heard. Respodent is directed
to pay Rs.6000/- as interim maintenance to the child till
disposal of MC. Wife claim will be decided in the MC”
2.     It is found from the impunged order that it was
passed when M.P.No.629/2021 was posted for objection of the
respondent.      A direction is found issued to the respondent in
the impugned order to pay Rs.6,000/- as interim maintenance
allowance to the child till disposal of the MC but at the
sametime the wife was denied any interim maintenance
allowance without assigning any reasons.
3.     What was the reason for declining to pass an order
granting interim maintenance allowance to the wife was not
revealed from the order extracted above. Therefore, the order
is a non-speaking one. There is no hard and fact rule that all
claims of the parties must be allowed.     But, the party has     a
right to be informed of the reasons for denial of his/her calim or
for prolonging it’s consideration to a future date. Since such a
reason is not stated in the impugned order, it is liable to fail.
In the above circumstances, without issuing notice to the
2nd respondent, this Court is constrained to allow the Original
Petition in part and to pass an order setting aside the impugned
order to the extent it directs adjudication of the wife’s claim for
interim maintenance allowance in the M.C. The direction to pay
Rs.6,000/- as interim maintenance allowance to the child is not
interfered with. The court below shall consider M.P.No.629/2021
with reference to the claim of the wife for interim maintenance
allowance and shall pass appropriate orders (either declining or
allowing the claim) stating sufficient and satisfactory reasons
for doing so.     The consideration of the claim of the wife and
passing of orders shall not go beyond three weeks from this
