(e) To grant costs of this petition to the petitioner and to

2.               The brief facts as stated by the petitioner are stated
2.1.             The petitioner has passed B.Com examination from
G.J. Sheth, Morbi college in general category. The petitioner
had appeared for 3rd B.Com examination conducted in March,
2007 in which out of total 7 subjects, petitioner had failed in
2 subjects, viz., Statistics and Management Accounting. The
petitioner had appeared in re-examination conducted by the
University in March, 2008 for the aforesaid 2 subjects, viz.
Statistics and Management Accounting and had secured result
of ‘pass class’ and secured 45.57%.
2.2.             The petitioner intending to pursue 3 years Bachelor
of Law (L.L.B.) course, had submitted an application dated
03.09.2020 before the respondent University seeking admission.
The petitioner had paid fees for both the semesters and had
appeared for internal examination conducted by the respondent
no.3 – college. The respondent no.3 – college after period of
some months, rejected the application of the petitioner stating
that the petitioner had given 2 try in B.Com and after final
examination of semester of semester refunded the fees paid by
the    petitioner.       The  petitioner      addressed    a    letter       to    the
respondent University on 25.06.2021 intimating them about the
aforesaid         facts.   The    university      replied      to      the        said
communication dated 25.06.2021 of the petitioner, by letter
dated 03.07.2021 stating that since the petitioner has given 2
try in 3rd year B.Com and was declared pass with ‘Exemption’.
Therefore, the percentage cannot be counted and as per the
Rules of Bar Counsel of India, student of Open/General
category are required to secure 45%, O.B.C. category 42% and
S.T. category 40% minimum to secure admission and since the
petitioner belonging to Open/ General category has so called
not secured 45% is ineligible to secure admission. It was
further informed that the admission process is under provision
of Bar Council of India and University.
2.3.             The petitioner wrote a letter to the Chairman /
Secretary, Bar Council of Gujarat intimating them about the
aforesaid facts by letter dated 22.07.2021 and further requested
to do the needful, if found eligible for course of 3 years L.L.B.
The      respondent     No.4   –    Bar      Council      of     Gujarat         by
communication dated 04.08.2021 stated that the petitioner has
secured 45.57% and considering the result of examination of
March, 2007 and March, 2008, and therefore, as per Rule-7 of
Bar Council of India Education Rules, 2008, and therefore, as
per Rule-7, the petitioner is eligible for getting admission in
course of Bachelors of Law course. The petitioner further wrote
a letter to the respondent-University on 07.08.2021 intimating
with regard to the letter dated 04.08.2021 addressed by the
respondent no.4 - Bar Council of Gujarat.
2.4.             The respondent – University by communication
dated 08.10.2021 informed the petitioner and reiterated that
any student who has appeared in examination and has given
two attempts, then in that case, the percentage cannot be
calculated on basis of both the mark-sheets and as per the
Rule of Bar Council of India, a student belonging to Open /
General       category  has  to   have       minimum      45%       to     secure
admission in 3 years L.L.B. course and therefore, the petitioner
is not eligible for getting admission. It was further impounded
that mark-sheet issued under Ordinance-154(d) exemptions.
3.      Heard Mr. Kuldip K. Acharya, learned counsel appearing
for the petitioner.
3.1.             Mr. Acharya, learned counsel submitted that the
respondent nos. 1 and 2 are statutory authority and they are
bound to follow the Rule of law. The exclusion of petitioner
on the basis of two attempts and to be treated as ‘pass class’
though the Bar Council of India is considering the total marks
obtained, irrespective of how many attempts made in passing
of such exams for the purpose of admission in L.L.B. course,
having given ‘pass class’ result is arbitrary and irrational.
3.2.             Mr.   Acharya, learned      counsel      submitted           that
reliance placed by the respondent University on Ordinance-
154(d)      does     not  came  exclusive     of   marks       in     counting
percentage, even otherwise, there is no rational in excluding
the students having passed in 2 nd attempt and counting marks
secured in the examination as of individual subjects.
3.3.             Mr. Acharya, learned counsel submitted that the Bar
Council of India is a statutory authority and the respondent
no.2 is bound to frame its Rules and Act for L.L.B. course in
consonance with the Rules and Regulations and norms of the
Bar Council of India.
3.4.             Mr. Acharya, learned counsel orally submitted that
the admission once granted cannot be retracted in absence of
any suppression.
3.5.             Mr. Acharya, learned counsel placed reliance on the
following authorities:
4.               Heard   Mr.   Shivang        Thacker,    learned          counsel
appearing for the respondent no.2 – university.
4.1.             Mr. Shivang Thacker, learned counsel has relied on
the affidavit-in-reply filed by the respondent-University reads
“4.       I say and submit that the petitioner by filing
the present petition has sought direction from this
Hon’ble Court to hold that petitioner is possessing the
educational qualification as required under Bar
Council of India Legal Education Rules and he is
qualified to pursue the 3 year LLB Course and has
sought the interim reliefs to reconsider the case of
the petitioner.
5.        I say that the present petitioner has
completed B.Com. Course in Saurashtra University in
the year March, 2008 in pass class. I say that the
present petitioner appeared in 3rd year B.Com
examination held in March, 2007 and was declared
failed in two subjects. I say that petitioner appeared
again only in two subjects in which he was declared
fail and claimed exemption in other subjects for
which he was declared passed. I say that petitioner
filed up the examination form only for two subject in
which petitioner declared failed and petitioner
claimed exemption in remaining subjects. I say that
again the petitioner appeared in two papers (Subjects)
in 3rd year B.Com examination held in March 2008. I
say that the petitioner had not cleared 3rd B.Com.
Examination in first trial and subsequently petitioner
appeared in examination held in March, 2008, which
was his second trial and in which petitioner claimed
exemption marks and cleared passed in two remaining
all the subjects in March, 2008 in which petitioner
declared fail in March-2007 exam.
6.        I say that any student who appeared in the
examination first time and not succeed/pass with all
the subjects but appeared again the examination with
obtain exemption marks in any of the subject and
decided not to appear again in the same subject
where he/she has got exemption then his/her final
result of the examination after clearing all the
subjects he result will be in pass class and he/she is
not entitled for any percentage as per the Ordinance
of the university. I say that as per the provisions
contained in Ordinance No.154 of The Saurashtra
University Act, a (student) who has passed the
examination after getting the benefit of exemption
marks in any subject, then after clearing all the
subjects he/she will be considered as passed in
passing class and percentage cannot be counted
because he/she has not cleared the examination in
one attempt and he/she had got the benefit of the
exemption marks and cleared the examination. I say
that in the mark-sheet of the petitioner in result
Column at page 11 of the petition clearly indicate
that pass class.
7.        I say that petitioner has not passed in first
trial in 3rd year B.Com., examination and claimed
benefit of the exemption marks and therefore, as per
the Ordinance No. 154 of Saurashtra University Act,
then the percentage of the petitioner cannot be
counted and only is given pass class. I reproduce
relevant part of the          Ordinance No.154 of The
“Except as herein otherwise provided, in a subject or
subjects in which identical papers (and practical tests)
are prescribed for another examination, shall at his
option, be entitled to exemption at the other
examination from such subject, provided always that
the standard attained at the original examination, is
not lower than that required at the other
examination. Candidates so exempted shall not be
eligible for classed or for University awards. A
candidate who has passed the examination after
obtaining the benefit of condonation shall be deemed
to have passed in individual subjects of the
examination with minimum percentage of the marks
required for passing such subjects”.
I say that passing standard of the 3 rd Year B.Com is
36% percentage. As per the above quoted Ordinance
154, petitioner has passed the 3 rd year Examination
with pass class that is 36 % percentage and not 45.57
% percentage as claimed by the petitioner. In view of
the aforesaid ordinance, it cannot be said that the
petitioner has obtained the qualifying marks for
getting admission in LL.B. as prescribed by the Bar
Council of Gujarat which is 45%. Therefore, petitioner
is not eligible for get admission in the LL.B. Course
because he is not having 45% marks in T.Y.B.Com.
Petitioner passed 3rd year examination in pass class as
stated above and pass class percentage cannot be
considered as 45.57% as claimed by the petitioner. He
is only having passing standard of 36% percentage.
8.        I say that the similar issue came up before
this Hon’ble High Court in the case of Dhamani
Ramesh Holaram in SCA No. 8554 of 2013 whereby
the petitioner who had cleared the 3rd year B.Com
with pass class after multiple attempts and was
denied the admission in the First Year LL.B
considering the provisions of Ordinance 154 of the
Saurashtra University Act. I say that the Hon’ble
Court after considering the provisions of the
Saurashtra University Act has dismissed the petition
filed by the petitioner and has held in view of the
provisions of the Ordinance 154 of the University Act.
Annexed hereto and marked as “Annexure-R1” is the
copy of the Judgment passed in SCA NO. 8554 of
9.        I say that, the in similar set of facts the
issue regarding the admission in LL.M Course where a
student had cleared LL.B examination after attempts
and secured pass class came up for consideration
before the Hon’ble High Court and the Hon’ble High
Court in SCA No. 17933 of 2014 has held such
student is not entitle for admission. I say that the
said Judgement is confirmed by the Hon’ble Division
Bench in LPA No. 51 of 2015. Annexed hereto and
marked as “Annexure-R2” is the copies of the said
4.2.             Relying on the aforesaid submissions, Mr. Thacker,
learned submitted that the petitioner has prayed for a direction
from this Court to hold that the petitioner is possessing the
educational qualification as required under the Bar Council of
India Legal Education Rules, 2008 for admission LLB course
and is qualified to pursue the 3 year LLB course and further
sought relief to reconsider the case of the petitioner may not
be granted in view of the fact that the case of the petitioner
falls under the provisions of Ordinance No. 154 of the
Saurashtra University Act and as the said Ordinance, once a
candidate seeks exemption, the candidate shall not be eligible
for class or for university awards. In the facts of the present
case, the petitioner having availed exemption under the
provision of Ordinance- 154, the petitioner would be held to
be ineligible to pursue the LLB course, having cleared 3 rd year
B.Com with ‘pass class’. The petitioner only having pass class
i.e. 36% and not 45.57%, and therefore, no error could be said
to have been committed by the respondent-University.
4.3.             Mr. Thacker, learned counsel has placed reliance on
the following authorities:
(I) Special Civil Application No. 8554 of 2013 order
dated 04.03.2015.
(II) Special Civil Application No. 17933 of 2014 order
dated 09.01.2015.

appearing for the petitioner, Mr. Shivang A. Thacker, learned
counsel       for    Mr.  A.R.   Thacker,       learned     counsel        for     the
respondent nos.1 and 2 – Saurashtra University, Though served
respondent No.3 has chosen not to appear, respondent no.4 has
unserved, Mr. Saurabh J. Mehta, learned counsel appearing for
the respondent no.5 and Mr. Ayaan Patel, learned Assistant
Government Pleader appearing for the respondent No.6 – State.
6.               It appears that the petitioner completed B.Com from
Saurashtra University in the year March, 2008 as disclosed
from the mark-sheet in ‘pass class’. The petitioner appeared in
3rd year B.Com held in March, 2007 and was declared ‘fail’ in
2 subjects, viz. Statistics and Management Accounting. The
petitioner again appeared only in 2 subjects, in which he was
declare failed and claimed exemption in other subjects, for
which he was declared ‘pass’. The petitioner filled-up the form
only for 2 subjects, in which petitioner was declared failed and
claimed ‘exemption’ in the remaining subjects. The petitioner
appeared in 2 papers /subjects in 3rd year B.Com. Examination
held in March, 2008. The petitioner had not cleared 3 rd year
B.Com. Examination in 1st try and subsequently, appeared in
the examination held in March, 2008 which was his 2 nd
trial/attempt, in which petitioner had claimed ‘exemption’ in
other subjects and cleared remaining 2 subjects in March,
2008, in which petitioner was failed in March, 2007. It
appears that the respondent no.3 – College accepted the form
duly filed by the petitioner on 03.09.2020 and also accepted
the fees paid by the petitioner to appear in the internal
examination conducted by the respondent no.3-college. The
respondent no.3 – college however refunded the fees duly paid
by the petitioner and rejected the admission of the petitioner
by the said communication dated 24.06.2021 (Annexure-C
page-12-13). The said communication reads thus:
Subject : In reference to your letter dtd. 03/06/2021
You have applied on 03/09/2021 for the admission in
Navyug L.L.B. College, in reference to which your name was
kept for enrollment and registration in Saurashtra University.
In which, the admission was given to you in L.L.B. according
to the mark-sheet of B.Com. in which you have secured 45 %.
But according to the admission rules of B.C.I. and University,
the necessary qualification according to the first mark-sheet is
45%, where as yours is 45.57 % which is the sum of two
mark-sheets. Hence, according to the aforementioned rules of
admission, you does not come in the criteria to fulfill the first
primary rule of admission. Hence, your enrollment was kept in
the Defect list in the Registration process. But, as you deos
not posses the eligibility for admission, hence, the University
has kept our name in the Defect list, about which we have
informed you through telephone.
Your admission was kept along with the admission process

Subject:Regarding cancellation of admission
Reference: Your application dated 25/06/2021
Apropos the aforementioned subject, it is to state that as per
your referred application, you had received the degree of B.Com in
yearly system and you had 2 trials in third year of B.Com. You
were declared pass with Exemption, hence percentage can not be
considered in it. As per the rules of the Bar Council of India, 45%
for the Open category, 42% for O.B.C. category and 40% for S.C./
S.T. categories have been fixed. Since you belong to open
category, you must have at least 45%, hence you are not eligible
to get admission in Semester-1 of LL.B.
Moreover, you were given admission by the college in the
year 2020. Thereafter, for enlistment by the University, the portal
of the concerned college is to be opened, the entry of the form is
done by the college and the file is to be submitted at the
University. Moreover, after the decision from University authority
and Bar Council of India, it is to be decided whether to do
enlistment of the college in which you got admission. Hence, after
analysis of the form submitted by the college, your enlistment is
not generated because you were not found eligible for Semester-1
of LL.B. and you are informed late in that regard.
Yours faithfully,
8.               The petitioner had also addressed a communication
to the Bar Council of Gujarat on 22.07.2021. The relevant para
of the said communication dated 22.07.2021 reads thus:
“….I would like to state in detail before you that I have graduated
from Saurashtra University, Rajkot. I failed in one subject in T.Y.
B.Com due to some reasons. I appeared in the examination for the
said subject again and passed it. Therefore, if we calculate the
marks of two marksheets for T.Y. B.Com, it is 45.57%. The copies
of both the said marksheets are attached herewith the application.
Thereafter, when I applied for the L.L.B. course, no affidavit was
demanded from me. Thereafter, when the college received a query
from the university, the college informed me that you will have to
submit an affidavit regarding age. I submitted it immediately. The
copy of the same is attached herewith.
Thereafter also, the college informed me that your admission has
not been confirmed yet. Therefore, when I asked the reason for the
same, I was told that you have not secured 45% marks, and
therefore your admission has been cancelled. Thereafter, I submitted
an application to the college that as per my marksheet, I have
45.57% marks and therefore do the needful. At that time, I was
told that, it has been informed by the university that the marks of
two marksheets cannot be considered as per the norms of the Bar
Council and therefore, you should know in this regard from the
university.
Thereafter, when I tried to know from the university by writing a
letter, they also replied that since you have passed with Exemption,
we cannot consider the total of both the marksheets as per the
rules of the Bar Council. The copies of the said letter and the reply
received from them are attached herewith. I request you to solve
this matter as early as possible.”

(2) Letter No : Exan Cell/866/2021 of this office dated
(3) Your application dated 07/08/2021
(4) Your application dated 14/09/2021
In connection with the aforesaid subject, in regrading with your
application at reference No.1 submitted due to not getting admission in
the three years LL.B course, a reply was given to you vide letter at
reference No.2 that, you have done your B.Com. degree in yearly system,
wherein your have two trials in third year. As you are passed with
Exemption, the same can not be considered in the percentages
calculation. As per the rule of the Bar Council of India, stipulated
percentages for the open category are 45%, for O.B.C. 42% and for S.C./
S.T. category it is 40%. As you are in open category, it is necessary to
have minimum 45%. Therefore, you are not eligible for the admission in
the LL.B. Semester-1. Therefore, you are not entitled to admission.
You enclosed the letter of Bar Council of Gujarat, dated
04/08/2021 with your letter at reference-3, it was stated in the same
that, you have 45.57 % and you can get admission in the LL.B. Course.
In regard with the same, you were informed in person that, if any
student at this University have passed any degree in yearly system and
he/she have two trials, then in such circumstances, percentages for the
same are not considered. Therefore, as per the rule of the Bar Council of
India for the eligibility for the Three Years LL.B., minimum 45% are
required for the open category. As you do not have the same, you are
not entitled to admission.
With regard to the mark sheet issued to you by the University for
the Three Years B.Com., kindly consider the Ordinance-154(d)
Exemptions, attached herewith.
Enclosure : Copy of Ordinance-154(d) Exemptions
““Except as herein otherwise provided, in a subject or subjects in which
identical papers (and practical tests) are prescribed for another
examination, shall at his option, be entitled to exemption at the other
examination from such subject, provided always that the standard
attained at the original examination, is not lower than that required at
the other examination. Candidates so exempted shall not be eligible for
classed or for University awards. A candidate who has passed the
examination after obtaining the benefit of condonation shall be deemed
to have passed in individual subjects of the examination with minimum
percentage of the marks required for passing such subjects”.
11.              In Special Civil Application No. 8554 of 2013, the
aforesaid       issue   was   considered        by this    Court      vide       oral
judgment dated 04.03.2015. The relevant para of the same
“8. Therefore, this Resolution clearly provides for the
situation where a student who has obtained the graduation
degree in more than one trial, then, in that case, the
percentage of marks may be calculated by totaling the
marks obtained in each paper at the time of clearing the
subject. However, Rule 7 of the Bar Council may not have
specifically provided. In any view of the matter, for the
purpose of admission O. 154 of the University would be
relevant which has also been quoted in the affidavit-in-
reply filed on behalf of respondent No.1 University. It has
been clearly contended that if the person has passed the
examination in more than one trial he would have the
benefit of exemptions in few papers but he would be
considered as having passed the examination with
minimum percentage of marks. Ordinance 154 refers to the
exemptions and it clearly mentions that the person would
be entitled to exemption at the other exams from the
other subjects. However, the standard attained at the
original examination is not lower than that required at the
other examination. It clearly provides,
“A candidate who has passed the examination after
obtaining the benefit of condonation shall be deemed to
have passed in individual subjects of the examination with
the minimum percentage of marks required for passing
such subjects.”
9. Therefore, in light of these clear provisions of the
Ordinance which hardly requires any further elaboration,
the case of the petitioner cannot be considered. It is
required to be mentioned that the Hon’ble Apex Court in
a judgment reported in (2013) 11 SCC 802 in the case of
Prayadarshini College of Computer Science & anr. v.
Manish Kumar & ors., has observed,
“15. It has to be kept in mind that every candidate
applying for a particular course in any college is expected
to go through the advertisement thoroughly including the
eligibility criteria prescribed for each course and after
fulfillment of the required conditions, state the correct
particulars in the application form failing which he/she
cannot claim any benefit for his/her own wrong.”
10. The Hon’ble Apex Court in a judgment reported in
(2003) 7 SCC 719 in the case of Regional Officer, CBSE v.
Ku. Sheena Peethambaran & ors. has observed and quoted
from the earlier judgment,
“We cannot by our fiat direct the University to disobey
the statute to which it owes its existence and the
regulations made by the University itself. We cannot
imagine anything more destructive of the rule of law than
a direction by the court to disobey the laws.”
11. Thus, while considering the aspect of eligibility with
minute details it is better to be left to the authority like
the University as an expert body and the court would
decline to interfere, in exercise of its discretionary
jurisdiction under Art. 226. Again, LL.B. is a professional
course and in order to have certain minimum standards if
the body like the University or the Bar Council have fixed
certain minimum standards, the same cannot be relaxed by
such interpretation so that a person who is not otherwise
qualified is permitted to join the course. Thus, when the
Ordinance of the University prescribes the eligibility, it
cannot be overlooked and the present petition cannot be
entertained.”
14.              The following judgments are relied upon by the
(I)              In the case of Sanatan Gauda University v/s.
Berhampur University reported in AIR 1990 SC 1075, the
Hon’ble Supreme Court in para-10 and 14 held thus:
"10. This is apart from the fact that I find that in the
present case the appellant while securing his admission in
the Law College had admittedly submitted his marks-sheet
along with the application for admission. The Law College
had admitted him. He had pursued his studies for two
years. The University had also granted him the admission
card for the Pre-Law and Intermediate Law examinations.
He was permitted to appear in the said examinations. He
was also admitted to the Final year of the course. It is
only at the stage of the declaration of his results of the
Pre-Law and Inter-Law examinations that the University
raised the objection to his so-called ineligibility to be
admitted to the Law course. The University is, therefore,
clearly estopped from refusing to declare the results of the
appellant's examination or from preventing him from
pursuing his final year course.”
“14. Mr. P.N. Misra, the learned counsel for the respond-
ent, contended that the University had informed the
Colleges about the necessary condition for admission to the
Law course which, it appears, was not respected by the
College. When the applications by the candidates for
sitting at the examination were forwarded by the College,
the University asked the Principal to send the marks of the
candidates for the purpose of verification. but the Principal
did not comply. The letters Annexures 'F' and 'G' to the
counter affidavit have been relied upon for the purpose.
The learned counsel pointed out that instead, the Principal
sent a letter Annexure '1' stating that the marks-list would
be sent in a few days for "your kind reference and
verification" which was never sent. The Principal wrongly
assured the University authorities that he had verified the
position and that all the candidates were eligible. In these
circum- stances, the argument is. that the appellant cannot
take advantage of the fact that the University allowed him
to appear at the examination. 1 am afraid, the stand of
the respondent cannot be accepted as correct. From the
letters of the University it is clear that it was not
depending upon the opinion of the Principal and had
decided to verify the situation for itself. In that situation it
cannot punish the student for the negligence of the
Principal or the University authorities. It is important to
appreciate that the appellant cannot be accused of making
any false statement or suppressing any relevant fact before
anybody. He had produced his marks-sheet before the
College authority with his application for admission, and
cannot be accused of any fraud or misrepresentation. The
interpretation of the rule on the basis of which the
University asserts that the appellant was not eligible for
admission is challenged by the appellant and is not
accepted by the College and my learned Brother accepts
the construction suggested by him as correct. In such a
situation even assuming the construction of the rule as
attempted by the University as correct, the Principal
cannot be condemned for recommending the candidature
of the appellant for the examination in question. It was
the bounden duty of the University to have scrutinized the
matter thoroughly before permitting the appellant to
appear at the examination and not having done so it
cannot refuse to publish his results.”
The aforesaid ratio is not applicable in the facts of the
present case, in view of the fact that as referred above, the
admission which was granted by the respondent no.3 college
stood cancelled by communication dated 24.06.2021 and fees
were also refunded to the petitioner and the University had
declined enrollment of the petitioner. In the case referred to
by the petitioner, the student/ candidate had undergone the
study for 2 years and was permitted by the University also to
appear in the University examination.
(II).            In the case of Shri Krishna v/s. The Kurukshetra
University reported in AIR 1976 SC 376, the Hon’ble Supreme
Court in para-7 held thus:
“It appears from the averments made in the counter
affidavit that according to the procedure prevalent in the
College the admission forms are forwarded by the Head of
the Department in December preceding 728 the year when
the Examination is held. In the instant case the admission
form of the appellant must have been forwarded in
December 1971 whereas the examination was to take place
in April/May 1972. It is obvious that during this period of
four to five months it was the duty of the University
authorities to scrutinise the form in order to find out
whether it was in order. Equally it was the duty of the
Head of the Department of Law before submitting the form
to the University to see that the form complied with all
the requirements of law. If neither the Head of the
Department nor the University authorities took care to
scrutinize the admission form, then the question of the
appellant committing a fraud did not arise. It is well
settled that where a person on whom fraud is committed is
in a position to discover the truth by due diligence, fraud
is not proved. It was neither a case of suggestio falsi, or
suppressio veri. The appellant never wrote to the
University authorities that he had attended the prescribed
number of lectures. There was ample time and opportunity
for the University authorities to have found out the defect.
In these circumstances, therefore, if the University
authorities acquiesced in the infirmities which the
admission form contained and allowed the appellant to
appear in Part I Examination in April 1972, then by force
of the University Statute the University had no power to
withdraw the candidature of the appellant. A somewhat
similar situation arose in Premji Bhai Ganesh Bhai
Kshatriya v. Vice-Chancellor, Ravishankar University,
Raipur and others(ii) where a Division Bench of the High
Court of Madhya Pradesh observed as follows:
“From the provisions of ordinance Nos. 19 and 48
it is clear that the scrutiny as to the requisite
attendance of the candidates is required to be made
before the admission cards are issued. Once the
admission cards are issued permitting the candidates
to take their examination, there is no provision in
Ordinance No. 19 or ordinance No. 48 which would
enable the Vice-Chancellor to withdraw the
permission. The discretion having been clearly
exercised in favour of the petitioner by permitting
him to appear at the examination, it was not open
to the Vice-Chancellor to withdraw that permission
subsequently and to withhold his result.”
We find ourselves in complete agreement with the reasons
given by the Madhya Pradesh High Court and the view of
law taken by the learned Judges. In these circumstances,
therefore, once the appellant was allowed to appear at the
Examination in May 1973, the respondent had no
jurisdiction to cancel his candidature for that examination.
This was not a case where on the undertaking given by a
candidate for fulfilment of a specified condition a
provisional admission was given by the University to
appear at the examination which could be withdrawn at
any moment on the non-fulfilment of the aforesaid
condition. If this was the situation then the candidate
himself would have contracted out of the statute which
was for his benefit and the statute (1) A.T.R. 1967 M. P.
194,197. 729 therefore would not have stood in the way of
the University authorities in cancelling the candidature of
the appellant.”
The ratio as laid down does not applicable in the facts of
the present case, in view of the fact that, in the aforesaid
decision, the University authority failed in scrutiny of the form
and it was held that the fraud could not be attributed to the
student.        However,      in   the    present      case,     the     respondent
University declined to enroll the petitioner, and there is no
allegation of fraud against the petitioner.
(III).                 In the case of Gujarat University v/s. Mukat
Navnitlal Kapadia reported in 1993 0 GLHEL-HC-204364, the
Court in para-3 held thus:
“(3).      MR. S.N. Shelat learned counsel for
respondents nos. 1 and 2/ appellant herein would
submit      that     when          Varanaseya       Sanskrit
Vishwavidyalaya is not a recognised institution the M.
Com. degree which the petitioner obtained from that
Vishwavidyalaya could not be of any avail to him for
seeking admission; when the obtaining of a M. Com.
degree from a recognised institution is the
prerequisite for such admission. Here we find a case
where there has been no play of fraud and no
suppression of fact on the part of the petitioner. It is
not as if the Gujarat University and its officials could
not verify the position despite the exercise of due
diligence. There was absolute lack of due diligence on
their part and they did not care to verify the position
and allowed things to rest. There was ample time and
opportunity for them to verify the position. Yet they
did not. In such a case as pointed out by the
Supreme Court in Shri Krishnan vs. The Kurukshetra
University Kurukshetra AIR 1976 SC 376 it would not
be a case of either suggestion false or suppression
veri on the part of the petitioner. He by himself did
not misrepresent any thing. The application of the
petitioner as already noted did go through a scrutiny
by the Admission Cell of the Gujarat University
specifically constituted therefore. Only after such
scrutiny and the grant of eligibility certificate the
petitioner went through the course in respondent no.
4-College. It is claimed that long after the petitioner
going through the course and taking the examination
and coming out successfully passing in first class with
distinction a complaint was received and further there
has been a Notification by the University Grants
Commission in June 1991 saying that Varanaseya
Sanskrit Vishwavidyalaya is not a recognized
institution. If there had been due diligence at the
appropriate level and time this position which is
inequitable indeed to the petitioner would not have
emerged. It is only in this context we are obliged to
take note of the principle of equitable estoppel and
render justice as the facts of the case demand. The
doctrine of equitable is grounded on the principle
that where a person having the means to know the
material facts remains inactive or negligent or
abstains from taking the requisite steps at his
command to ascertain the material facts so as to
repudiate the transaction in time and thereby the
other person is induced to suppose and act that there
is nothing reprehensible in the transaction it would
amount to acquiescence on the part of the former
and the transaction though could be impeached
originally becomes unimpeachable. It is true that
ordinarily one cannot be estopped to assert direct
violation of any statutory provision but equitable
estoppel being eminently a rule of justice is supposed
to prevail over all other rules. As already noted the
petitioner could not be stated to have committed any
fraud and he could not be slated to have suppressed
any thing and whatever infirmity the seeking of
admission by the petitioner to the course suffered
must be deemed to have been acquisced in by the
University and its authorities. Accordingly finding no
warrant for interference in Letters Patent Appeal we
dismiss this Letters Patent Appeal. Letters Patent
It appears that no fraud was attributed to the student
and it was held that the University must be deemed to have
acquiesced to give admission. In the present case, as stated
above the University declined to enroll the petitioner.
The aforesaid judgment relied upon by the petitioner is
not applicable in the facts and circumstances of the present
15.              In Special Civil Application No. 17933 of 2014, the
aforesaid issue was considered vide an order dated 09.01.2015,
relevant para reads thus:
“6. In view of these rival submissions, it is required to be
noted that whether present petition can be entertained and
allowed or not.
7. From perusal of the papers, it is evident that the
petitioner is claiming admission in LL.M., course. The basic
requirement is pointed out by learned Senior Counsel Shri
Shelat referring to the ordinance of the University is that
candidate must have passed at the first attempt with degree
of Bachelor of Law (Third Year LL.B., of                        Gujarat
University). Thus, it is evident that one must
have passed Third Year LL.B., in the first attempt with
second class and marksheet did not reflect that the
petitioner       has     passed      as required. Admittedly, there
was ATKT and therefore, it cannot be said that the
petitioner is eligible, having passed with second class in the
first attempt. The submissions which have been made with
much emphazise by learned Advocate for the petitioner
referring to the subsequent marksheet showing him as
passed with 50%, are            misconceived,      as     it     cannot
be said to be a first attempt. Therefore, it is an
issue with regard to eligibility and criteria and for                that
purpose,       it    is    required      to   be     considered         by
the Respondent like Respondent No.2University.
8. The Hon’ble Apex Court has observed that consideration
of the aspect of the eligibility with minute details, other
examination and          the     material     should      be       better
left      to    the     authority      like University as an expert
body. The Court is not equipped and may not have
necessary and relevant material, therefore normally the
Court would not interfere with such decision of an expert
body.
Further, in a judgment referred to and relied upon by
learned counsel Shri Shelat reported in (2003) 7 SCC 719
in the case of Regional Officer, CBSE Vs. Ku. Sheena
Peethambaran & Ors., it has also been observed and quoted
from the earlier judgment that,
“We cannot by our fiat direct the University to
disobey the statute to which it owes its
existence       and     the regulations        made       by
the     University      itself.     We    cannot imagine
anything more destructive of the rule of law than a
direction by the court to disobey the laws.”
Thus, in the facts of the case also when the ordinance
of the University prescribes eligibility, it cannot be
overlooked and the present petition cannot be entertained,
even if by inadvertence, the fees are accepted by the
college.”
16.             The order passed in Special Civil Application No.
17933 of 2014 came to be confirmed in Letters Patent Appeal
No. 51 of 2015.
17.            In the case of Principal, Patna College, Patna v/s.
Kalyan Srinivias Raman reported in AIR 1966 SC 707, the
Supreme Court observed thus:
“….where the question involved is one of interpreting a
regulation framed by the Academic Council of a University,
the High Court should ordinarily be reluctant to issue a
writ of certiorari where it is plain that the regulation in
question is capable of two constructions, and it would
generally not be expedient for the High Court to reverse a
decision of the educational authorities on the ground that
the construction placed by the said authorities on the
relevant regulation appears to the Hi Court less reasonable
than the alternative construction which it is pleased to
accept. The limits of the High Court's jurisdiction to issue a
writ of certiorari are well-recognised and it is, on the
whole, desirable that the requirements prescribed by
judicial decisions in the exercise of writ jurisdiction in
dealing with such matters should be carefully borne in
mind.”
18.             In the case of Devender Bhaskar & Ors. v/s. State
of Haryana & Ors. reported in JT 2021 (11) SC 444, the
Hon’ble Supreme Court in para-20 to 26 observed as under:
“20. We have already noticed that one of the eligibility
criteria for appointment to the post of Arts and Crafts
teacher as per the advertisement dated 20.07.2006 is a
“two-year Diploma in Art and Craft examination conducted
by the Haryana Industrial Training Department or an
equivalent qualification recognized by the Haryana Education
Department.” It was made clear by the Industrial Training
and Vocational Educational Department, Haryana, that
diploma in Art and Craft Course by the Kurukshetra
University is conducted through distance education and that
this course cannot be equated with two-year diploma in Art
and Craft Course awarded by the Haryana Industrial Training
Department. Recognition of the said Course by the State of
Haryana, as held by the High Court, is entirely different
from its equivalence. When the experts in the Education
Department have held the diploma in Art and Craft by the
Kurukshetra University is not equivalent to the two-year
diploma in Art and Craft awarded by the Haryana Industrial
Training Department, we are of the view that the High
Court was not justified in equalizing them.
21. In Mohammad Shujat Ali & Ors. v. Union of India &
Ors 1, it was held that the question regarding equivalence of
educational qualifications is a technical question based on
proper assessment and evaluation of the relevant academic
standards and practical attainments of such qualifications. It
was further held that where the decision of the Government
is based on the recommendation of an expert body, then the
Court, uninformed of relevant data and unaided by technical
insights necessary for the purpose of determining
equivalence, would not lightly disturb the decision of the
Government unless it 1 (1975) 3 SCC 76 is based on
extraneous or irrelevant considerations or actuated mala fides
or is irrational and perverse or manifestly wrong.
22. In J. Ranga Swamy v. Government of Andhra Pradesh
and Others, 2 this Court held that it is not for the court to
consider the relevance of qualification prescribed for various
posts.
23. In State of Rajasthan & Ors. v. Lata Arun, 3 this Court
held that the prescribed eligibility qualification for admission
to a course or for recruitment to or promotion in service are
matters to be considered by the appropriate authority. It was
“13. From the ratio of the decisions noted above, it is
clear that the prescribed eligibility qualification for
admission to a course or for recruitment to or
promotion in service are matters to be considered by
the appropriate authority. It is not for courts to decide
whether a particular educational qualification should or
should not be accepted as equivalent to the
qualification prescribed by the authority.”
24. In Guru Nanak Dev University v. Sanjay Kumar Katwal
& Anr., 4 this Court has reiterated that equivalence is a
technical academic matter. It cannot be implied or assumed.
Any decision of the academic body of the university relating
to equivalence should be by a specific order or resolution,
duly published. Dealing specifically with whether a distance
education course was equivalent to the degree of MA
(English) of the appellant university therein, the 2 (1990) 1
SCC 288 3 (2002) 6 SCC 252 4 (2009) 1 SCC 610 Court held
that no material had been produced before it to show that
the distance education course had been recognized as such.
25. In Zahoor Ahmad Rather & Ors. v. Sheikh Imtiyaz
Ahmad & Ors. 5, it was held that the State, as an employer,
is entitled to prescribe qualifications as a condition of
eligibility, after taking into consideration the nature of the
job, the aptitude required for efficient discharge of duties,
functionality of various qualifications, course content leading
up to the acquisition of various qualifications, etc. Judicial
review can neither expand the ambit of the prescribed
qualifications nor decide the equivalence of the prescribed
qualifications with any other given qualification. Equivalence
of qualification is a matter for the State, as recruiting
authority, to determine.
26. Having regard to the above, in our view, the High Court
has erred in holding that the diploma/degree in Art and
Craft given by the Kurukshetra University is equivalent to
two-year Diploma in Art and Craft examination conducted by
the Haryana Industrial Training Department or diploma in
Art and Craft conducted by Director, Industrial Training and
19.             The aforesaid judgments as relied upon by the
petitioner are not relevant for deciding the eligibility of the
petitioner for admission in the law course. The petitioner
passed with 2nd attempts / trials and appeared only in the two
subjects i.e.       Statistics and Management Accounting, in which
he declared failed. The Ordinance – 154 framed by the
Saurashtra        University     for    ‘exemption’    comes       into       play.
Admittedly,        the    petitioner     appeared   in   3 rd    year       B.Com
examination held in March, 2007 and was declared ‘fail’ in 2
subjects. The petitioner again appeared for 2 subjects only in
March, 2008, for which he was declared pass and claimed
exemption for other subjects. The petitioner could not clear 3 rd
year B.Com. Examination in the year March, 2008 only in 2 nd
attempt and he could not clear the examination in 1 st attempt.
Having claimed exemption, Ordinance 154 of the Saurashtra
University Act comes into play. This Court in aforesaid
decisions has considered the provisions of Ordinance 154 of the
Saurashtra University Act and considered the Rule-7 of the Bar
Council of India Education Rules, 2008 and held that if the
candidate passed the examination in more than 1 trial/attempt,
he would have the benefit of exemption in few papers but he
would be considered as having passed the examination with
minimum percentage of marks. In the present case, the mark-
sheet duly produced at Annexure-A (pg-10-11) clearly states
that the petitioner has secured ‘pass class’. Further the
eligibility as prescribed by the University cannot be overlooked
and the petitioner cannot be said to have eligible and to have
secured minimum 45% as prescribed by the Bar Council of
Gujarat for securing admission in L.L.B. course. The issue with
regard to the eligibility criteria is required to be considered by
the respondent – University. This Court otherwise cannot sit in
an Appeal to a decision taken by an expert body, and
therefore, this Court is not inclined to interfere under Article-
226 of the Constitution of India.
20.              In view of above, the Rules of Bar Council of India
do not provide for conducting of examination and result
thereof. The Rule only suggests that a candidate must possess
45% marks for securing the admission in law course/ L.L.B.
course. The University Ordinance No. 154 as referred above
prevails over the Rules of the Bar Council of India and when
the petitioner had passed B.Com. Examination with ‘exemption’
i.e. in ‘pass class’ and on 2 nd attempts, he is not eligible for
admission in the L.L.B. course.
21.               In view of above, this Court is not inclined to
exercise its extraordinary jurisdiction under Article-226 of the
Constitution of India, by directing the respondents to consider
the educational qualification of the petitioner as required under
Bar Council of India Legal Education Rules, 2008 for admission
to LLB course when petitioner has passed B.Com. examination
with ‘pass class’.
In view of above, the petition fails and is accordingly
In view of the order passed in the main petition, the
Civil Application do not survive and the same also stands
dismissed, accordingly.
