Through: Mr. Anuj Garg, Advocate for JD-2
1.      This hearing has been done through hybrid mode.
2.      The present application has been filed on behalf of the
Applicant/Decree-Holder-Ms. Himani Walia seeking waiver of payment of
stamp duty in respect of the assets inherited by the various parties from the
estate of Late Sh. S.S. Walia and his sister Dr. Urmila Walia. Further, the
Applicant seeks cancellation of the notice dated 14th February, 2022
received from the Registry of the High Court of Delhi, as also notice dated
3rd March 2022 received from the Office of the Assistant Collector (Kalkaji),
3.      The suit seeking partition and other reliefs, being CS (OS) No.
442/2018, was filed before this Court by the legal heirs of Late Sh. S.S.
Walia who had passed away on 10th December, 2017. The deceased had a
large number of moveable and immovable assets which included the
business of a petrol station, export business, various immovable properties
in prime localities in Delhi and Noida, fixed deposit receipts and bank
accounts, paintings, antiques, artworks, shares in various companies and
vehicles, etc. During the pendency of the suit itself, the three children and
the wife of the deceased with the assistance of their Counsels had arrived at
a settlement. Thereafter, the terms of settlement were incorporated into the
‘Memorandum of Family Settlement and Arrangement’ dated 16th October,
4.      Thus, the settlement which was agreed upon by the parties had merely
been put into writing in the said ‘Memorandum of Family Settlement and
Arrangement’ dated 16th October, 2018. The said family settlement was
approved and a decree in terms thereof was passed by this Court, vide order
dated 16th October, 2018. The relevant portion of the said the family
settlement and order, which clearly reflect that the parties had orally agreed
to partition and the manner thereof, are set out below:
‘Memorandum          of    Family      Settlement         and
Arrangement’ dated 16th October, 2018:
“AND WHEREAS for the sake of records and to serve
as an aid memoir, the parties hereto have decided to
execute these presents to reduce the decisions taken by
them with regard to the inter se distribution and
allocation of the property and assets in writing.”
“3. She has thereafter travelled to India along with her
child and has been staying here since then. The parties,
along with the assistance of their counsels have arrived
at a settlement which is recorded in the ‘Memorandum
of family settlement and agreement dated 16th October,
5.      It appears that in order to prepare the decree sheet, the Registry of this
Court has directed furnishing of valuation reports of the assets for the
purpose of calculating the stamp duty. Thus, the present application has been
filed by the Applicant seeking waiver of payment of stamp duty and
cancellation of the notices.
6.      It is submitted by ld. Counsel for the parties that similar notices have
been received by all the other legal heirs as well. In addition, various
Collector’s offices have already issued notices in respect of the stamp duty
7.      It must be noted here that the legal heirs of the deceased persons
became part owners of the assets belonging to the two deceased individuals
i.e., Mr. S.S. Walia and Dr. Urmila Walia, immediately upon their demise.
The said assets were not transferred to the legal heirs, but have been
inherited by them upon the demise of Mr. S.S. Walia and Dr. Urmila Walia.
The ‘Memorandum of Family Settlement and Arrangement’ dated 16th
October, 2018, is merely a recordal of the oral agreement as to the mode and
manner of partition. Therefore, it is in the nature of a family settlement
which was arrived at between the parties. The partition had been agreed
upon between the parties by way of oral agreement with the intervention of
their counsels. The memorandum of settlement does not itself partition the
properties, but only records the same as an aid of memory.
8.      The issue of registration of family settlements is no longer res integra.
If an understanding has been arrived at between the parties previously, and it
is only written down in a document after the settlement has been arrived at,
the same would not require registration. This is the settled position of law as
is clear from Kale & Ors. v. Deputy Director of Consolidation & Ors. [3
(1976) 3 SCC 119]. Taking into account the decision in Kale (supra), the
Supreme Court in a subsequent judgment in Sita Ram Bhama v. Ramvatar
Bhama [AIR 2018 SC 3057] has settled this position of law by holding as
“10. The only question which needs to be considered in
the present case is as to whether document dated
09.09.1994 could have been accepted by the trial court in
evidence or trial court has rightly held the said document
inadmissible. The Plaintiff claimed the document dated
09.09.1994 as memorandum of family settlement.
Plaintiff's case is that earlier partition took place in the
life time of the father of the parties on 25.10.1992 which
was recorded as memorandum of family settlement on
09.09.1994. There are more than one reasons due to
which we are of the view that the document dated
09.09.1994 was not mere memorandum of family
settlement rather a family settlement itself. Firstly, on
25.10.1992, the father of the parties was himself owner
of both, the residence and shop being self-acquired
properties of Devi Dutt Verma. The High Court has
rightly held that the said document cannot be said to be a
Will, so that father could have made Will in favour of his
two sons, Plaintiff and Defendant. Neither the Plaintiff
nor Defendant had any share in the property on the day
when it is said to have been partitioned by Devi Dutt
Verma. Devi Dutt Verma died on 10.09.1993. After his
death Plaintiff, Defendant and their mother as well as
sisters become the legal heirs under Hindu Succession
Act, 1955 inheriting the property being a class I heir.
The document dated 09.09.1994 divided the entire
property between Plaintiff and Defendant which
document is also claimed to be signed by their mother as
well as the sisters. In any view of the matter, there is
relinquishment of the rights of other heirs of the
properties, hence, courts below are right in their
conclusion that there being relinquishment, the document
dated 09.09.1994 was compulsorily registrable Under
Section 17 of the Registration Act.
11. Pertaining to family settlement, a memorandum of
family settlement and its necessity of registration, the law
has been settled by this Court. It is sufficient to refer to
the judgment of this Court in Kale and Ors. v. Deputy
Director       of      Consolidation         and           Ors.
propositions with regard to family settlement, its
registration were laid down by this Court in paragraphs
10. In other words to put the binding effect and the
essentials of a family settlement in a concretised
form, the matter may be reduced into the form of
(1) The family settlement must be a bona fide one
so as to resolve family disputes and rival claims by
a fair and equitable division or allotment of
properties between the various members of the
(2) The said settlement must be voluntary and
should not be induced by fraud, coercion or undue
(3) The family arrangement may be even oral in
which case no registration is necessary;
(4) It is well settled that registration would be
necessary only if the terms of the family
arrangement are reduced into writing. Here also, a
distinction should be made between a document
containing the terms and recitals of a family
arrangement made under the document and a mere
memorandum prepared after the family
arrangement had already been made either for the
purpose of the record or for information of the
court for making necessary mutation. In such a
case the memorandum itself does not create or
extinguish any rights in immovable properties and
therefore does not fall within the mischief of
Section 17(2) of the Registration Act and is,
therefore, not compulsorily registrable;
(5) The members who may be parties to the family
arrangement must have some antecedent title,
claim or interest even a possible claim in the
property which is acknowledged by the parties to
the settlement. Even if one of the parties to the
settlement has no title but under the arrangement
the other party relinquishes all its claims or titles
in favour of such a person and acknowledges him
to be the sole owner, then the antecedent title must
be assumed and the family arrangement will be
upheld and the courts will find no difficulty in
(6) Even if bona fide disputes, present or possible,
which may not involve legal claims are settled by a
bona fide family arrangement which is fair and
equitable the family arrangement is final and
binding on the parties to the settlement.
11. The principles indicated above have been
clearly enunciated and adroitly adumbrated in a
long course of decisions of this Court as also those
of the Privy Council and other High Courts, which
we shall discuss presently.
12. We are, thus, in full agreement with the view taken by
the trial court as well as the High Court that the
document dated 09.09.1994 was compulsorily
registrable. The document also being not stamped could
not have been accepted in evidence and order of trial
court allowing the application Under Order XII Rule 3
Code of Civil Procedure and the reasons given by the
trial court in allowing the application of the Defendant
holding the document as inadmissible cannot be
faulted.”
9.      The Division Bench of this Court has held in Nitin Jain v. Anuj Jain
& Anr. [ILR (2007) II DELHI 271] that a memorandum recording an oral
family settlement which has already taken place is not an instrument
dividing or agreeing to divide property and is therefore, not required to be
stamped. The relevant observations from the said judgment have been
“6. A Partition Deed is an instrument of partition and
has been defined in Section 2(15) of the Stamp Act. The
said investment is chargeable to duty as per Schedule 1.
Article 45 of the Stamp Act. Stamp duty payable on an
instrument of partition is @ 1% of the value of the
property. A decree of partition passed by a Court is also
an instrument of partition as defined in Section 2(15) of
the Stamp Act, which reads as under:
"2(15). "Instrument of partition" means any
instrument whereby co-owners of any property
divide or agree to divide such property in severalty,
and includes also a final order for effecting a
partition passed by any revenue-authority or any
Civil Court and an award by an arbitrator directing
7. However, Courts have recognised oral partitions in
cases of joint families. An oral partition is not an
instrument of partition as contemplated under Section
2(15) of the Stamp Act. Therefore, as it is not an
instrument. on an oral partition no stamp duty is
payable.
8. The Courts have recognised that it is legally
permissible to arrive at an oral family settlement
dividing/partitioning the properties and thereafter record
a memorandum in writing whereby the existing joint
owners for the sake of prostriety record that the property
has been already partitioned or divided. The
memorandum does not by itself partition the properties
but only records for information what has already been
done by oral partition. The memorandum itself does not
create or extinguish any rights. A record of oral partition
in writing is created. The writing records a pre existing
right and does. not by itself partition the properties for
the first time. As the memorandum only records oral
partition which has already taken place but does not in
praesenti create any right, it cannot be treated as an
instrument creating B partition. [Refer. Tek Bahadur
Bhujil v. Debi Singh Bhujil and others reported in AIR
1966 SC 292), Bakhtawar Singh v. Gurdev Singh
reported in (1996) 9 SCC 370, Kale v. Dy. Director of
Consolidation reported in (1976) 3 SCC 119, Roshan
Singh v. Zile Singh reported in AIR 1988 SC 881 and
Bachan Singh v. Kartar Singh and others reported in
9. In view of the legal position explained above. it
follows that a decree of partition is an instrument of
partition and therefore is required to be stamped under
Schedule I of Article 45 r/w Section 2(15) of the Stamp
Act. However, an oral family settlement dividing or
partitioning the property is not D required to be
stamped. Similarly, a memorandum recording an oral
family settlement which has already taken place is not an
instrument dividing or agreeing to divide property and is
therefore not required to be stamped.”
10.     Thus, it is clear that family settlements are not required to be
compulsorily registered, and stamp duty is not required to be compulsorily
paid in respect of the same, when the settlement has been arrived at initially
as an oral partition and is thereafter put into writing for the purpose of
information. Considering the said position, it is clarified that there is no
requirement of valuation of the suit properties in the present case. The
payment of stamp duty by the legal heirs of Late Sh. S.S. Walia and Dr.
Urmila Walia shall stand waived. Notices issued by the various authorities
shall also stand cancelled and withdrawn, without any further orders.
11.     Decree sheet be drawn by the Registry, within a period of eight
weeks, and compliance be reported. Accordingly, EX.APPL.(OS) 338/2022
is disposed of, in the above terms.
12.     List on 9th May, 2022, the date already fixed.
