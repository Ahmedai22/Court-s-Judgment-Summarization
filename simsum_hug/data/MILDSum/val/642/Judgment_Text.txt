The petitioner, a widow, aged 73 years knocks the doors
of this Court, alleging lack of sympathy or even empathy, on
the part of the respondent/Canara Bank, a State under Article
12 of the Constitution of India (‘the Bank’ for short) in
recovering Rs.6,40,329/- from out of the family pension
account of the petitioner and seeks a direction by issuance of a
writ in the nature of mandamus, directing re-credit of the said

3. Shorn of unnecessary details, the facts in brief, are as
The    petitioner   is  an    account     holder    in   the
respondent/Bank and is a recipient of family pension from its
hands. The husband of the petitioner one R.V.Pawar was
working as a Technical Assistant Executive Engineer at Chief
Engineer, C & B (S) Office, Government of Karnataka and
retired from service on 31.05.2002.       The said Government
servant    was    having    a  regular    pension     account    at
Vishveshwarnagar Branch, Hubli of the erstwhile Syndicate
Bank, which is now merged with the Bank.          Till the end of
February,   2019    R.V.Pawar   was   recipient   of   pension   of
Rs.38,604/- from the Branch.       On centralization of pension
from March 2019, the Centralized Pension Processing Centre
(‘CPPC’ for short) started making payment of pension to the
pension holders. The account of the husband of the petitioner,
which was at Hubli was later transferred to Kasturinagar
WP No. 20321 of 2021
Branch, Bangalore.    Thereafter, the husband of the petitioner
was being paid through Kasturinagar Branch from the CPPC.
4.  From March 2019, the husband of the petitioner
appears to have been paid Rs.96,998/- per month in place of
Rs.38,604/-, which resulted in excess payment of pension of
Rs.13,40,261/- upto 6th February, 2021, the date on which the
husband of the petitioner dies. Therefore, there was an excess
payment into the account of the husband of the petitioner from
March, 2019 to 06-02-2021. The husband of the petitioner dies
on 06.02.2021.      After the death of the husband of the
petitioner, family pension as payable to the petitioner was not
immediately    processed.     The   petitioner represented   for
payment of family pension. What the petitioner would get back
is a communication that excess pension has been paid to the
husband of the petitioner and later an order of refund of
Rs.13,40,261/- came to be passed against the petitioner. The
petitioner again pleaded that she was not aware of the deposits
made into the account of her husband and she being 73 years
old cannot come to the Bank during the pandemic and sought
to seek pension. What comes about is debit of Rs.6,40,000/-
WP No. 20321 of 2021
from family pension account of the petitioner without even any
communication     on   intermittent  intervals. The   petitioner
complains to the Bank that the debits are unauthorized and
then knocks the doors of this Court in the subject petition
seeking re-credit of the alleged unauthorized debits.
5. The learned counsel appearing for the petitioner would
submit that the petitioner was not aware of what the problem
was but did admit that if there is any excess payment that has
come to the account of the husband of the petitioner, she
would clear it but not in one go.    However, the Bank did not
accede to her request and on intermittent intervals had debited
Rs.6,40,000/- from family pension amount and it is not even
paying any family pension to the petitioner.
6. On the other hand, the learned counsel appearing for
the respondent/Bank, Sri T.P.Muthanna, would vehemently
refute the submissions to contend that the petitioner is in
receipt of unjust enrichment as the husband of the petitioner
did very well know the amount that was being paid as pension
and its threefold increase immediately. The increase was on
WP No. 20321 of 2021
account of certain mistake in the CPPC, where excess amount
of pension was deposited into the account of the husband of
the petitioner. Therefore, the petitioner cannot contend that no
amount should be debited from her account as excess pension
was deposited to the account of the husband of the petitioner.
Whether the petitioner being aware of the deposit or not,
cannot be a ground to deny refund of the entire excess amount
as it is public money.
7.  I   have given   my  anxious    consideration to  the
submissions made by the respective learned counsel and
perused the material on record.
8. The afore-narrated facts are not in dispute. The
husband of the petitioner who was an employee of Government
of Karnataka retires on 31-05-2002 and his pension account
was being handled by the Syndicate Bank and later on, its
merger with the respondent/Bank.           The husband of the
petitioner was getting Rs.38,604/- as pension upto February,
2019 and on account of reckless or callous functioning of the
Officers of the Bank in CPPC, the pension of the husband of the
WP No. 20321 of 2021
petitioner goes up from 38,604/- to Rs.96,988/-. This continues
from March 2019 to 06-02-2021 close to two years. The
husband of the petitioner dies on 06.02.2021. Thereafter, the
petitioner who becomes entitled to family pension, seeks such
payment from the hands of the respondent/Bank.          What the
petitioner    would   get  in   return   to  her   request  is a
communication dated 06-08-2021 enclosing intimation dated
14-07-2021, both of which read as follows:
Reg: Excess pension paid to late Ramanath V.Pawar.
With regard to above we have received a copy of the
letter from CPPC issued to you with a copy to us. As we
did not receive any reply from you, on enquiry you
informed CPPC that you have not received any letter so
far they asked us to call you and obtain acknowledgment.
In spite of our repeated request you have not come to
branch to collect the letter copy and in the mean time we
have sent the same to your daughters e-mail id a copy.
Now once again we are sending a hard copy.
WP No. 20321 of 2021
Now we request you to submit the reply regarding the
payment of Excess Pension which you have to repay at
the earliest.
Kindly make the arrangements for refund of excess
payment immediately.

with PPO No. 223614/RPR, drawing pension from
our Kasturinagar Branch, through SB account

of Rs.1340261/- (Thirteen lakhs forty thousand
two hundred and sixty one only) was paid in excess
of the eligibility to your spouse Lt.Mr. R.V.Pawar
from March 2019 to 6th of February 2021 (Till date
of death).
We request you to make arrangements for refund
of excess payment immediately.”
(emphasis added)
The  petitioner  replies  to   the  said  communications   on
07-09-2021. The reply reads as follows:
Subject:    Refund of Excess Pension paid to my late
husband Mr. R.V.Pawar.
With reference to the above subject, I undersigned Mrs.
Vimala Ramnath Pawar acknowledge the receipt of your
recovery letter dated 14-07-2021.
I received the letter on 6-08-2021 and have replied on
9.08.2021 asking for time to reply after getting some
advice and ascertaining facts.
On     8-07-2021      without     any   intimation    or
information my family pension account, my
husband’s account and another joint account was
abruptly put on hold. On each account a sum of
Rs.5,00,000/- (5 lakh rupees) was put on hold and
even now currently my account is put on hold
As a matter of fact, on 3-05-2021 I had written a
letter to Branch Manager Kasturi Nagar and has
requested them to check and intimate me why the
family pension fixed was so meager when
compared to my husband’s pension. I occasionally
followed it up and waited for a reply but was in
utter shock when abruptly all the accounts were
WP No. 20321 of 2021
put on hold immediately without any information.
Instead of getting a reply on status from bank, my
account was put on hold.
I am under great mental distress, and pressure that due
to some banking error excess pension was paid to my
late husband and now the same will be recovered from
me through my family pension which in itself is not
sufficient to maintain myself. The pension being
disbursed every month currently is Rs.13055/- which I
have not even withdrawn a single time. My husband
passed away 7 months ago on 6-02-2021.
The joint account I have with my daughter and my late
husband was also put on hold and an amount of
Rs.200000/- has been debited from bank without our
consent. The ledger balance shows Rs.2,19,420/- but the
available balance is only Rs.19,420/-.
With great grief I would like to submit that I am not able
to clear the balance at once. Also, a large amount has
been deducted as TDS which my husband has not
My late husband was a dementia patient who was on
complete assistance and needed full support for his daily
activities. And moreover, he had written several times for
enhanced pension and other benefits to various
government departments.
I need more time to collate his papers, make enquiries
with government departments and I am also trying to
arrange some funds through relatives if possible, to make
some part payment. However, I request you to un hold
my account and give me access to operate it so that I am
take care of my basic daily/monthly needs.
How can bank suddenly put my account on hold and
immediately demand a recovery. As per your letter
the excess amount was paid over a period of two
WP No. 20321 of 2021
years to my husband. Is it fair to stop my family
pension and deprive me completely by putting my
account on hold.
Please let me know how I should sustain myself,
pay my grocery bills, medical bills and day to-day
expenses. Currently I am dependent on my
relatives who have lent me a few thousand rupees.
I am in such pitiful state. In case of my medical
emergency, I will be stranded and helplessly left
with no treatment.
I did not anticipate that bank can be so inhumane
to me. I am 73 year old women who is already
going through hardships mentally, physically and
emotionally after my husband’s death. How can this
act of Bank be justified.
Kindly release my account and give me access to my
family pension for my survival.”
(emphasis added)
The petitioner narrates that without any intimation, from her
family pension account a sum of Rs.5,00,000/- is put on hold
and she pleads that she is in great mental distress and excess
amount is not deposited due to the fault of the husband of the
petitioner to his account but if recovery is made from her
account in that regard she would face lot of problems to
maintain herself. The family pension was only Rs.13,055/- and
she was not permitted to draw that even once and later also,
without any communication, the Bank has unauthorisedly
WP No. 20321 of 2021
debited Rs.2,00,000/-. In this manner, the Bank has harassed
the petitioner for 7 months after the death of her husband for
certain act that she is not even aware of.
8. For the folly of the officers of the Bank in depositing
excess amount, the 73 years old widow is being made to move
from pillar to post for getting a meager sum of Rs.13,055/- as
family pension and the Bank is also unauthorisedly seeking to
debit Rs.6,40,000/- from the money that is lying in the
account.   The petitioner pleads that it has become difficult to
sustain herself and her grocery bills and medical bills have all
been left unpaid and she is in a pitiful state. This state of affairs
does   not   even   move    the   Bank   and    unauthorized   debit
9. The learned counsel for the respondent/Bank would
contend    that   the   Master    Circular  for   disbursement     of
Government Pension by agency banks permits such recovery in
terms of Clause 13, which reads as follows:
“Recovery of Excess/wrong payment made to a
WP No. 20321 of 2021
13. Details of the uniform procedure evolved for recovery
of excess/wrong payments made to pensioners drawing
pension under the Scheme for payment of pension to
Central/Civil/Defence/Railways      pensioners      through
agency banks, are given below:
(a)  As soon as the excess/wrong payment made to a
pensioner comes to the notice of the paying branch,
the branch should adjust the same against the
amount standing to the credit of the pensioner’s
account to the extent possible including lumpsum
arrears payment.
(b)  If the entire amount of overpayment cannot be
adjusted from the account, the pensioner may be
asked to pay forthwith the balance amount of
overpayment.
(c)  In case the pensioner expresses his inability to pay
the amount, the same may be adjusted from the
future pension payments to be made to the
pensioners. For recovering the overpayment made
to pensioner from his future pension payment in
installments 1/3rd of net (pension + relief) payable
each month may be recovered unless the pensioner
concerned gives consent in writing to pay a higher
installment amount.
(d)  If the overpayment cannot be recovered from
the     pensioner      due   to    his   death     or
discontinuance of pension then action has to
be taken as per the letter of undertaking given
by the pensioner under the scheme.
(e)  The pensioner may also be advised about the
details of over payment/wrong payment and mode
of its recovery.”
He would place reliance upon sub-clause (d) of Clause 13, that
if overpayment cannot be recovered from the pensioner due to
his death or discontinuance of pension, then action has to be
taken as per the letter of undertaking given by the pensioner
under the Scheme. Though recovery of excess amount is
permitted in terms of the Master Circular, which depicts
uniform recovery of wrong payments made to pensioners
drawing pension, that would not mean that the amount that is
paid in excess is to be recovered in one stroke that too, from
the petitioner who is a widow depending on family pension and
is suffering from ailments at the age of 73 years. The Officers
of the Bank who have indulged in such callous or reckless
transfer of excess pension to the account of the husband of the
petitioner should be made/held accountable for such act. It is
for the Bank to take such appropriate action against those
erring officers / officials and fix accountability, in accordance
with law.
10. Pension, is trite, not a bounty or a gratis that is
granted to the pensioner or the spouse of the pensioner as a
family pension, for the Bank to deal with it at its whim and
WP No. 20321 of 2021
fancy. It is to be noticed that the husband of the petitioner is
not an employee of the Bank. He has only his account in the
Bank. Pension is deposited rightly in the CPPC.         The State
Government has not paid any excess pension to the husband of
the petitioner. It is the irresponsibility of the Officers of the
Bank, which has led to such over payment.            Therefore, to
generate a balance in the facts and circumstances becomes
necessary. The amount that is deposited into the account of the
husband of the petitioner is neither the money belonging to the
callous officers nor the money that belonged to the husband of
the petitioner. It is “public money”. Therefore, I deem it
appropriate to permit recovery of the amount in equal monthly
installments of Rs.4,000/- (Rupees four thousand only) from
the hands of the petitioner.
11. For the aforesaid reasons, I pass the following:
(i)   Writ Petition is allowed.
(ii)  A mandamus shall issue to the respondent/Bank to
re-credit   the   amount    that is  recovered   i.e.,
WP No. 20321 of 2021
Rs.6,40,000/- or whatever, from the account of the
petitioner, within two weeks from the date of
receipt of a copy of this order and also pay
appropriate pension without any deductions on this
issue.
(iii)   The Bank is at liberty to recover Rs.4,000/- every
month from the family pension of the petitioner till
the alleged excess amount deposited in the account
of the husband of the petitioner gets cleared.
