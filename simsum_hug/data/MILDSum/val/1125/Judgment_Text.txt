1.   The petitioner is before this Court seeking for the
following reliefs:-
"i)   Call for the records in C.C.No.2541/2017
(PCR No.30/2017) pending on the file of Judicial
(ii)   Quash      the  complaint     dtd.02.02.2017
(Annexure-A) and the entire proceedings in
C.C.No.2541/2017 (PCR No.30/2017) pending on
the file of Judicial Magistrate First Class-II,
Mangaluru (Annexure-B) in so far as it relates to
petitioner herein, in the interest of justice and
equity.
(iii) Grant such other and further reliefs as are
just even including the costs of this petition."
2.   A private complaint in PCR No.30/2017 has been filed by
the first respondent - complainant alleging that the
petitioner has held out himself to be a very Senior
Advocate in Bangalore and having connections with
WP No. 54069 of 2017
Senior    Advocate    of  the   Supreme    Court   and   had
represented that he could put across the complainant to
such Senior Advocates who could represent the matter
and obtain favourable orders. It is on that basis, various
amounts were paid to the petitioner to be paid to the
Advocate appearing before the Supreme Court as also to
enable the petitioner to travel to Supreme Court and
appear in the said matter.
3. It is alleged that on 18.04.2016, when the matter was
taken up for hearing before the Apex Court and at the
end of      the day when the complainant called the
petitioner enquiring about the status of the matter, the
petitioner did not inform him properly and as such, the
complainant suspected the bonafides of the petitioner and
it is on that basis a criminal complaint came to filed in the
aforesaid PCR seeking for action to be taken against the
petitioner.
4. Sri.G.Krishnamurthy, learned Senior counsel appearing
for the petitioner would submit that the petitioner has
WP No. 54069 of 2017
only discharged his duties as an Advocate and has
appeared in the matter along with the counsel before the
Apex Court. The orders that may be passed by the Apex
Court or any other Court is left to the Court.   There is
only an effort which would be made by a counsel to try
and get favourable orders and that is the only promise
that was made, which cannot amount to an offence under
Section 406 and 420 of the IPC in as much as the
petitioner is only discharging his professional functions
and there is no inducement as such made by the
petitioner.
5. Per   contra,  Sri.Thontadharya  R.K.,  learned   counsel
appearing for the respondent No.1 would submit that a
huge amount of Rs.14,60,000/- was made payment for
the conduct of the matter before the Apex Court and on
that day, the matter after hearing was only adjourned
and no favorable orders was passed. Therefore, offence
under Sections 406 and 420 have been committed.
WP No. 54069 of 2017
6. Respondent No.2 has not been appearing in the matter
and on 24.08.2022, this Court had recorded that if none
were to appear for respondent No.2, the matter would be
taken up for consideration. As such, the matter is taken
up for consideration.
7. Heard Sri.G.Krishnamurthy, learned Senior appearing for
the petitioner and Sri.Thontadharya R.K., learned counsel
appearing for respondent No.1 and perused the papers.
8. In the present matter, allegations have been made by a
client against an Advocate alleging that since he did not
obtain favourbale orders as contended by him, offences
under Sections 406 and 420 of IPC have been committed.
A perusal of the complaint would indicate that the
statement    attributed  to   the petitioner is that  the
petitioner would introduce and or refer the matter to an
Advocate in Delhi and also that the petitioner would
appear before the Apex Court in a matter of the
complainant. An advocate can only appear and make his
best efforts in the matter. No advocate can either state
WP No. 54069 of 2017
or hold out that he would obtain favourable orders nor
could a client believe that an Advocate will definitely
obtain favourable orders just because he has made
payment of the fees to the Advocate.
9. Merely because a client were not to succeed in the matter
and favourable orders were not passed in favour of that
particular client, the said client cannot make out a case
that there is a fraud which has been committed by the
Advocate and offence under Sections 406 and 420 of IPC
which has been committed by an Advocate. That would
lead to disastrous consequences. It is for all litigants to
understand that an Advocate can only make best efforts
in the matter and the case would be decided on the basis
of merits. In a Adversarial system like that in our Country
were one party initiates a litigation against the other it is
bound to happen that one will win and other will lose
which is on the basis of the facts of the case and the law
applicable.
10. Whoever the Advocate may be, the outcome depends on
the facts and the law applicable thereto.      Hence, the
payment of fees, the amount of fees is also not relevant
for the outcome of the matter that is a private matter
between the client and the Advocate.
11. In the above background, the allegations now being made
that since the huge amount of money has been paid as
fees to the Advocate, the Advocate had to obtain
favourable orders, it is not sustainable nor it would
amount to an offence under Section 406 and 420 of IPC.
No grounds have been made out in the compliant. The
criminal proceedings being an abuse in the process of the
Court. As such, I pass the following:-
i. The petition is allowed.
ii. The proceedings in C.C.No.2541/2017
arising out of PCR No.30/2017 pending
on the file of Judicial Magistrate First
Class-II, Mangaluru is hereby quashed.
WP No. 54069 of 2017
iii. It is needless to state that the order of
cognizance dated 06.02.2017 is also
quashed.
