1.      The petitioners in the above captioned petitions are employees of
different forces i.e. Central Reserve Police Force („CRPF‟), Sashtra
Seema Bal („SSB‟), Border Security Force („BSF‟) and Central Industrial
Security Force („CISF‟) Indo Tibetan Border Police („ITBP‟) etc., who
have preferred these petitions under Article 226/227 of the Constitution of
India seeking issuance of a writ of certiorari to the respondents for
quashing of orders denying them the benefit of Old Pension Scheme
(„OPS‟) in accordance with CCS (Pension) Rules, 1972 to them vide
different Office Memorandums and Signals issued by the respondents. In
addition, also sought quashing of OM dated 17.02.2020 issued by
respondents to the extent it does not grant benefit of Old Pension Scheme
to the personnel who have been appointed pursuant to notifications/
advertisements dated 01.01.2004.
2.      The primary relief sought by the petitioners in these petitions is for
grant of OPS to the personnel, who have though been appointed after
01.01.2004, but had applied for the posts prior to 01.01.2004. Since the
relief sought in these petitions is similar, therefore, vide order dated
08.08.2022 [in W.P.(C) No. 3424/2022] this Court had directed that
W.P.(C) No. 12712/2021 shall be treated as the lead matter and with the
W.P.(C) 12712/2021 & connected petitions                          Page 16 of 58
consent of learned counsel for the parties, Mr. Ankur Chibber, Advocate
and Harish Vaidyanathan Shankar, learned Standing Counsel, were called
upon to put-forth the case on behalf of the petitioners and respondents
respectively.
3.      Mr. Ankur Chibber, learned counsel appearing on behalf of
petitioners submitted that The Special Selection Board (CPOs-2002) in
June 2002 had issued an advertisement inviting applications from eligible
candidates for filing up the Group „A‟ post of Assistant Commandants in
the Border Security Force, Central Reserve Police Force, Indo-Tibetan
Border Police Force and Special Security Bureau (Now Sashastra Seema
Bal). As per the said advertisement, the last date for applying under the
said examination was 30.06.2002. The written examination was scheduled
for 02.03.2003 and the successful candidates appeared for PET, Interview
and Medical examination between October, 2003 till February, 2004. The
final result was declared in July, 2004. The petitioners were offered
appointment for the post of Assistant Commandant during the period
October, 2004 till 2005. In the interregnum, vide Notification dated
22.12.2003, New Contributory Pension Scheme („NPS‟) was implemented
w.e.f. 01.01.2004, however, the said scheme was not applicable to Armed
Forces, as the Forces shall be governed by the OPS already existing.
4.      Finding that the NPS was less beneficial than the OPS, a few
personnel whose selection process had started prior to 01.01.2004 but had
received appointment letters thereafter, preferred writ petitions before this
Court and the said petitions being Naveen Kumar Jha Vs. UOI & Ors.
W.P.(C) 12712/2021 & connected petitions                          Page 17 of 58
Del 7274, were allowed by this Court. The Special Leave Petition („SLP‟)
preferred by the respondents [SLP (Civil) CC No.13755/2013] against the
decision dated 02.11.2012 was dismissed by the Hon‟ble Supreme Court
vide order dated 12.08.2013 with direction to implement the order dated
02.11.2012 in three months.
5.      Thereafter, Directorate General Border Security Force, Ministry of
Home Affairs, Government of India, vide order dated 13.01.2016 directed
to convert the petitioners and other similarly situated SI/DE selected
through CPOs examination 2002 as members of the OPS.
6.      The similar issue was again raised and decided by this Court in
7879 and Tanaka Ram & Ors. Vs. UOI & Ors. 2019 SCC OnLine Del
6962 where-under in view of the fact that the advertisements were prior to
coming into force NPS, the relief was granted to petitioners. Even the SLP
[SLP (C) Diary No.25228/2019] preferred by the respondents/UOI was
dismissed by the Supreme Court vide order dated 02.09.2019.
7.      The Ministry of Home Affairs („MHS‟) thereafter vide OM dated
13.04.2018 directed all the CAPFs to extend similar benefits of “Old
Pension Scheme to all affected personnel” in terms of decisions of this
Court in W.P.(C) No.3834/2013 and W.P.(C) No. 2810/2016. Vide
another letter dated 16.10.2018, respondent-BSF had notified that the
selections done prior to 01.01.2004 will be governed by OPS. Further,
vide Signal dated 23.10.2018, the respondents had clarified that all
candidates selected through advertisement prior to 22.12.2003, need to be
W.P.(C) 12712/2021 & connected petitions                          Page 18 of 58
treated as members of Old Pension Scheme.
8.      Learned counsel for petitioners submitted that contrary to their own
orders, the respondents vide order dated 11.12.2018 extended the benefit
of OPS to only those personnel whose recruitment process was completed
by 31.12.2003 but joined the force after 01.01.2004. However, the
petitioners before this Court have not been granted the benefit of OPS for
the reason that their recruitment process completed after 01.01.2004 i.e.
when the NPS was in force, which is contrary to the law laid down by this
Court in Gopal Babulal & Ors. Vs. Union of India & Ors 2019 SCC
OnLine Del 11894. Learned counsel submitted that even thereafter, vide
orders dated 06.02.2019 and 19.07.2019, the benefit of OPS has been
extended to certain officials/ personnel, however, have been denied to the
petitioners.
9.      Afterwards, another writ petition being Shyam Kumar Choudhary
& Ors. Vs. UOI & Ors. 2019 SCC OnLine Del 11891 was filed by a few
personnel who had joined the 37th Batch of CRPF and had had been
selected in the examination conducted in 2003; but were issued call letters
in January or February, 2004 and this Court in view of the fact that those
petitioners could not join prior to 01.01.2004 due to fault of the
respondents, granted them benefit of OPS vide order dated 09.04.2019.
Again, the SLP [SLP (C) No.31539/2019] preferred by the respondents
was dismissed by the Supreme Court vide judgment dated 27.09.2019 and
even the Review Petition preferred against the said order was dismissed
by the Supreme Court vide order dated 24.11.2020.
10.     In the meanwhile, respondent-CRPF issued a Memorandum dated
W.P.(C) 12712/2021 & connected petitions                          Page 19 of 58
26.08.2020 whereby it decided to extend the benefit of OPS only to the
petitioners in the case of Shyam Kumar Choudhary (Supra) and 13 other
similarly situated personnel, excluding the personnel such like petitioners.
Vide Signal dated 28.08.2020, a direction was issued to the Directorate to
ensure compliance of order dated 09.04.2019. Thereby, the order dated
09.04.2019 attained finality in all respects and become the settled position
of law.
11.     Further submitted that pursuant to judgment dated 09.04.2019, this
Court in vide decision dated 13.12.2019 in Niraj Kumar Singh and Ors.
Vs. Union of India and Ors. 2019 SCC OnLine Del 11892 and vide
judgment dated 16.12.2019 in W.P.(C) No.11169/2019, titled as Chander
Veer Singh and Ors. Vs. Union of India and Ors. directed the
respondents to grant the benefit of OPS to the petitioners therein. Yet
again, another SLP (being SLP No.9950/2020) preferred by the
respondents was dismissed by the Supreme Court vide order dated
16.04.2021. Thereafter, vide order dated 28.01.2020 in writ petition
bearing No.756/2020, this Court directed the respondents to grant similar
benefit to the petitioners therein and the SLP filed by respondents/Union
of India (Being SLP No.173/2021) stood dismissed by the Supreme Court.
12.     Learned counsel for petitioners submitted that once vide judgment
dated 09.04.2019 in W.P. (C) No.1358/2017 it was held that the personnel
belonging to the 37th Batch, being the juniors of petitioners, will be
entitled to Old Pension Scheme; then it implies to senior batch to which
the petitioners belong. Despite being a settled law on the subject that
where an advertisement has been issued prior to 01.01.2004 but the
W.P.(C) 12712/2021 & connected petitions                          Page 20 of 58
successful candidates have been issued appointment letters subsequent to
the NPS due to administrative delay on the part of respondents, then all
such candidates must be given the benefit of OPS. Thus, the refusal of
respondents to grant similar benefit to persons such like petitioners is
arbitrary and illegal and deserves to be set aside.
13.     Learned counsel for petitioner placed reliance upon decision of
Supreme Court in State of U.P. and Ors. Vs. Arvind Kumar Srivastava
and Ors. 2015 (1) SCC 347 to submit that when a set of employees has
been given relief by the Court, then all other identically placed persons
need to be treated alike by extending the benefit to them.
14.     It was next submitted by learned petitioners‟ counsel that the OM
dated 17.02.2020 issued by the Department of Pension and Pensioner's
Welfare, which mentions that in cases where the final result for
recruitment were declared before 01.01.2004 against the vacancies
occurring on or before 31.12.2003, only those candidates shall be eligible
for OPS under the CCS (Pension) Rules, 1972, is bad in law, as it is the
settled position that in cases where the recruitment process had been
initiated prior to the notification dated 22.12.2003 but appointment letters
have been issued on a subsequent date, they shall be entitled to OPS.
15.     Learned petitioners‟ counsel submitted that writ petitions filed by
the personnel of BSF, being Vipul Pandey and Ors. Vs. Union of India
and Ors. 2020 SCC OnLine Del 1243 and Ithape Pandit Kisanrao and
Ors. Vs. Union of India and Ors. 2020 SCC OnLine Del 1295, were
decided by this Court vide common Judgment dated 06.11.2020, whereby
benefit of OPS have been granted to the petitioners therein and the SLP
W.P.(C) 12712/2021 & connected petitions                          Page 21 of 58
(being SLP (C) No. 11543/2021) preferred by the respondents stood
dismissed on 12.07.2021 and 17.09.2021. The respondents have in
compliance of aforesaid judgment, granted benefit of OPS to the
petitioners therein, who are infact juniors to the petitioners in these
petitions.
16.     The petitioners, aggrieved by the fact that they were not granted
OPS by the respondents, filed various representations praying for
extension of the benefit of coverage under CCS (Pension) Rules, 1972,
however, respondents vide Signal dated 12.10.2021, declared petitioners
ineligible for switching over to pension Scheme under the Rules.
17.     Learned counsel for petitioner submitted that respondents vide
Memo dated 26.08.2020, Signal dated 28.08.2020 and order dated
22.09.2021, have granted benefit of OPS to batch-mates and juniors of
petitioners but the petitioners have been discriminatively treated for
reasons best known to respondents only.
18.     Even thereafter, vide common judgment dated 15.01.2021, this
Court in W.P.(C) No.9252/2020 titled as Shabad Prakash Punia and Ors.
Vs. Union of India and Ors.; W.P.(C) No.5075/2020 titled as Sudesh
Kumar Singh and Ors. Vs. Union of India and W.P.(C) No.7445/2020,
titled as Harbir Singh and Ors. Vs. Union of India and Ors. granted
benefit of OPS to the petitioners therein and again the SLP (being SLP (C)
No. 7373/2021) preferred by the respondents against thereof, stood
dismissed by the Supreme Court vide judgment dated 09.07.2021.
19.     Learned petitioners‟ counsel pointed out that furthermore, this
Court in Jas Winder Singh & Ors. Vs. UOI & Ors. 2021 SCC OnLine
W.P.(C) 12712/2021 & connected petitions                          Page 22 of 58
Del 3194 vide order dated 15.02.2021 directed the respondents to grant
benefit of OPS to petitioners therein on parity to their batch-mates and
the SLP[ being SLP(C) No. 11749/2021] preferred by the respondents
stood dismissed on 31.08.2021.
20.     Learned counsel sturdily submitted that despite various aforesaid
decisions and the fact that the Supreme Court has clarified that CRPF is
an Armed Force of the Union of India and the notification dated
06.08.2004 issued by the Government of India stating that the CRPF is the
Armed Force of the Union, respondents are not covering the petitioners
under the OPS, as has been applied in case of Army, Air force and Navy.
21.     On the other hand, Mr. Harish Vaidyanathan Shankar, learned
Standing Counsel appearing on behalf of respondents, submitted that
petitioners have joined the respective Forces during the years 2004 and
2005 and the Ministry of Finance, Government of India, vide Notification
No.5/7/2003-ECB & PR dated 22.12.2003, published in the Gazette of
India, Extraordinary, Part-I, Section 1, dated 22.12.2003 implemented
NPS for new entrants to Central Government Service, except to Armed
Forces, thereby replacing the OPS. Since the petitioners joined the
services after coming into force the aforesaid Notification, these
petitioners were not entitled to OPS under the CCS(Pension) Rules, 1972
(Old Pension Scheme. Learned Standing Counsel pointed out that the
petitioners in W.P.(C) No. 1358/2017; W.P.(C) No. 3834/2013 and
W.P.(C) No. 2810/2016 had qualified the recruitment process prior to
notification of NPS, however, the petitioners herein had not qualified the
recruitment process prior to Notification dated 22.12.2003. It was
W.P.(C) 12712/2021 & connected petitions                          Page 23 of 58
submitted that only one stage of examination was complete prior to
01.01.2004 and all the other three stages were conducted thereafter. It was
submitted that there were factual errors in judgment dated 09.04.2019
passed in W.P.(C) No. 1358/2017, however, since SLP against the said
order [being SLP(C) Diary No. 31539/2019] was dismissed by the
Supreme Court vide order dated 27.09.2019; the Department of Personnel
and Pensioners‟ Welfare („DOP&PW‟) advised the MHA vide OM dated
26.08.2020 to implement the judgment dated 09.04.2019 only in the case
of petitioners therein. Similarly, the benefit of OPS was extended to the
petitioners in WPC No. 6548/2020 as there were factual errors in the
Judgment dated 06.11.2020 passed by this Court and also since, SLP
against the said Judgment was dismissed by the Supreme Court of India
vide order dated 12.07.2021, the MHA accorded to implement the said
benefit to the petitioners in WP(C) No. 6548/2020 in persona.
22.     Learned       Standing         Counsel      submitted      that the    various
representations / references received by the DOP & PW, vide OM dated
17.02.2020 clarified that in all cases where the recruitment results were
declared before 01.01.2004 against vacancies occurring on or before
31.12.2003, the candidates declared successful for recruitment shall be
eligible for coverage under CCS(Pension) Rules, 1972 and the
Government servants appointed on or after 01.01.2004 will not be eligible
for OPS. Thereafter, the Board of Officers constituted under chairmanship
of IG, NS, CRPF to assess eligibility of officers who were appointed in
CRPF on or after 01.01.2004 by qualifying the competitive examination
advertised prior to 01.01.2004, examined their representations/ references
W.P.(C) 12712/2021 & connected petitions                                   Page 24 of 58
made by them and found them „ineligible‟ for OPS, as their final result
was declared after 01.01.2004.
23.     Next, on the pleas of petitioners that NPS is not applicable to the
members of the CRPF, learned Standing Counsel for the respondents
submitted that in terms of Section 3 of CRPF Act, 1949, CRPF is an
Armed Force of the Union of India and the Notification dated 22.12.2003,
the „ARMED Forces‟ implies to Army, Navy and Air Force and not to the
entire armed forces of the Union.
24.     Lastly, learned Standing Counsel for respondents placed reliance
upon recent decision of a Division Bench of this Court in Satya Dev
Prajapati and Others Vs. Delhi High Court, through its Registrar
General and Anr. 2022 SCC OnLine Del 3911, whereby the petitioners
have been denied benefit of OPS. Also submitted that in Shyam Kumar
Choudhary (Supra) and Ithape Pandit Kisanrao (Supra) the petitioners
have been granted relief in persona and the said decisions are not
applicable to the case of petitioners herein and so, these petitions deserve
to be dismissed.
25.     In rebuttal, learned counsel for petitioners submitted that
respondents have failed to appreciate that the advertisement was issued in
June, 2002; final result was declared in July, 2004 and petitioners were
appointed in November, 2004 – January, 2005, when the OPS was in
vogue and for the fault of respondents for not completing the recruitment
process in a timely manner, the petitioners cannot be made to suffer.
Further submitted that petitioners are entitled to similar benefit as has
been granted to petitioners in W.P.(C) 1358/2017; W.P.(C) 6548/2020 and
W.P.(C) 12712/2021 & connected petitions                          Page 25 of 58
W.P.(C) No. 6989/2020 vide judgments dated 09.04.2019 and 06.11.2020
respectively. Thus, the petitioners sought quashing of Memorandum dated
26.08.2020, Signal dated 28.08.2020 and order dated 22.09.2021 to the
extent respondents have granted benefit of OPS only to the petitioners in
W.P.(C) 1358/2017; W.P.(C) No. 6548/2020 in compliance to the order
dated 09.04.2019 and 06.11.2020 respectively, excluding the similarly
situated personnel like the petitioners. Lastly, learned petitioners‟ counsel
submitted that petitioners deserve benefit of OPS in terms of notification
dated 22.12.2003, MHA letter dated 06.08.2004 and in accordance with
CCS (Pension) Rules, 1972 by treating them members of Armed Forces of
the Union of India.
26.     This Court had heard extensive arguments addressed on behalf of
both the sides. On perusal of material placed before this Court as well as
decisions relied upon by both the sides, we find that the petitioners in
these petitions are personnel belong to different Forces i.e. CRPF, BSF,
CISF, SSB, ITBP (CAPFs) etc. Subsequent upon publishing of
advertisements for filling up different posts in these Forces, the petitioners
herein claim to have applied in the years 2002-03, 2003-04. While the
recruitment/ selection process was in progress, the NPS was introduced
vide Notification dated 22.12.2003, which was to be implemented w.e.f.
01.01.2004. The petitioners, employed in various Forces, claim that
according to the said Notification, the scheme of NPS was not applicable
to the Armed Forces. Meaning thereby, the Armed Forces shall be
governed by the Old Pension Scheme already existing. However, given
that this benefit was not extended to the personnel of the armed forces, a
W.P.(C) 12712/2021 & connected petitions                          Page 26 of 58
quite many of them took the plea that since their recruitment/ selection
process commenced prior to Notification dated 22.12.2003, they shall be
covered under the OPS, though the respondents have treated them as a
member of NPS.
27.     The petitioners claim to have made different representations before
the competent authority of their respective Force, however, their prayer
for grant of benefit of OPS was turned down vide different Office
Memorandums, Signals etc. Hence, aggrieved against the denial of
respondents to grant the petitioners these petitions have been filed. The
relief sought in the present petitions is as under:-

28.    To submit that the personnel appointed pursuant to advertisement
which have been issued prior to 31.12.2003 shall be eligible to get OPS is
no longer res integra, learned counsel for petitioners placed reliance upon
various decisions of this Court. The relevant paras of decisions relied
upon are as under:-
(i)      In Naveen Kumar Jha (Supra), it has been held as under:-
“9. With respect to the Pension Scheme it assumes
importance to note that petitioner's batch mates
were issued letters offering appointment in March
2003 and had petitioner likewise been issued a
letter offering appointment, he too would have
W.P.(C) 12712/2021 & connected petitions                            Page 32 of 58
been a member of the old Pension Scheme. As a
result of petitioner being offered employment in
April 2004, he has perforce been made a member
of the new Pension Scheme.
11.          We highlight in the instant case the
fortuitous circumstance of the petitioners being
made to join as Assistant Commandant on
08.08.2005 is not the result of anything created by
the petitioners but is a result of a supine
indifference and negligence on the part of the
ITBP officials.
18.          On the subject of the petitioner being
entitled to the old Pension Scheme, in similar
circumstances, deciding WP(C) No. 10028/
2009 Amrendra Kumar v. UOI, where the
petitioner therein was also similarly deprived the
opportunity to join with his batch on account of
delay in conducting medical re-examination, the
Court had directed that said writ petitioner would
be entitled to the benefit of the old Pension
Scheme which remained in force till December 31,
19. The petitioner would be entitled to similar
benefit and accordingly the next mandamus issued
is by way of a direction to the respondents to treat
the petitioner as a member of the pension scheme
which remained in vogue till December 31, 2003”
(ii)        In Parmanand Yadav (Supra), this Court observed
and held as under:-
W.P.(C) 12712/2021 & connected petitions                          Page 33 of 58
“9. With respect to the Pension Scheme it assumes
importance to note that petitioner's batchmates
were issued letters offering appointment in March
2003 and had petitioner likewise been issued a
letter offering appointment, he too would have
been a member of the old Pension Scheme. As a
result of petitioner being offered employment in
April 2004, he has perforce been made a member
of the new Pension Scheme.”
(iii)     In Tanaka Ram (Supra), this Court observed and held as
“6.         A new Contributory Pension Scheme was
introduced on 22nd December, 2003 and was to be
implemented with effect from January, 2004. This
was monetarily less beneficial than the Old
Pension Scheme. Those who had been offered
letters of appointment on 17th December, 2003
were covered by the Old Pension Scheme whereas
those candidates like the Petitioners whose letters
of offers of appointment were issued only in
February, 2004 were deprived of the benefit of the
7.          A batch of the Petitioners who were
selected pursuant to a Sub-Inspector (DE),
Examination 2002 and were also deprived of the
benefit of the Old Pension Scheme on account of
the delay on the part of the Respondents in issuing
the appointment orders. They filed WP (C) No.
3834/2013 (Parmanand Yadav v. Union of India)
in this Court. By a judgement dated 12th February,
2015 this Court allowed the said writ petition. The
W.P.(C) 12712/2021 & connected petitions                                Page 34 of 58
Court in doing so followed its earlier order dated
26th May, 2011 in WP (C) No. 5400/2010 (Avinash
Singh v. Union of India) which was followed in the
decision dated 2nd November, 2012 in WP (C) No.
3827/2012 (Naveen Kumar Jha v. Union of India).
14.         The Court finds that in V. Ramana
Murthy, the Division Bench of this Court did not
take note of the order dated 13th January, 2016
issued by the BSF itself accepting the decision in
Parmanand Yadav. By issuing the said order
dated 13th January, 2016, the BSF was accepting
that the delay in issuing the offers of appointment
was for reasons not attributable to Parmanand
Yadav similarly situated but on account of the
Respondents. That factual situation made the
decision in Shailender Kumar v. DHC (supra)
referred to in V. Ramana Murthy (supra)
inapplicable.
17.         In other words, the BSF itself has
accepted that the benefit of the decision in
Parmanand Yadav (supra) and the option to
continue the Old Pension Scheme should be
extended to all those who had been selected in the
exam conducted in 2003 but were only issued call
letters in January or February, 2004.
18.         For the above reasons, the Respondents
are directed to extend the benefit of the Old
Pension Scheme to all the Petitioners in the
present petitions and pass consequential orders
within a period of eight weeks from today.”
(iv)      In Inspector Rajendra Singh (Supra) it has been
W.P.(C) 12712/2021 & connected petitions                          Page 35 of 58
held as under:-
“17. Had the petitioners and others, who opted for
the Border Security Force, known that by opting for
the Border Security Force, they would have been
denied the benefit of the Old Pension Scheme, they
would perhaps have not opted for the Border
18. In our view, basic terms and conditions of
service, such as the right to receive pension upon
superannuation, as applicable at the time of
notification of the posts, cannot later be altered to
the prejudice of the incumbents to the post, after
commencement of the selection process.”
(v)       Thereafter, in Niraj Kumar Singh and Others Vs. Union of
India and Others 2019 SCC OnLine Del 11892, in the light of
decisions in Naveen Kumar Jha (Supra),                     Parmanand Yadav
(Supra), Inspector Rajendra Singh (Supra) relied upon by learned
counsel for petitioners, this Court observed and held as under:-
“5. The short question that arises in this petition
is whether the Petitioners are covered by the OPS
which was replaced by the new Contributory
Pension Scheme, which came into effect from
6. It has been consistently held by this Court in a
series of orders that those who had participated in
the examination of 2003 would be covered by the
OPS, notwithstanding that they had been offered
letters of appointment only after 1st January, 2004.
Among the several orders of this Court is an order
dated 2nd November 2012 in W.P.(C) 3827 of 2012
(Naveen Kumar Jha v. Union of India) where in
W.P.(C) 12712/2021 & connected petitions                                  Page 36 of 58
the context of a delay in the issuance of the letter
of appointment of a Sub-Inspector (SI) of the
Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF), beyond
1st January 2004, on account of the delay in the
authorities having him examined by a Review
Medical Board, it was held that the Petitioner
would be covered by the OPS.
7. By a subsequent order dated 12th February,
2015 in W.P.(C)                  3834/2013 (Parmanand
Yadav v. Union of India) in the context of SIs of
the Border Security Force (BSF) whose letters of
appointment were delayed beyond 1st January
2004, it was held that they too would be covered
by the OPS. The BSF accepted this and other
judgments that followed and its Director General
(DG) issued an order dated 13th January 2016 in
which inter alia it was stated:
“therefore, in respectful compliance of
order dated 12.02.2015, passed by
Hon'ble High Court of Delhi, approval
of Competent Authority i.e. Ministry of
Home Affairs is hereby conveyed to
convert the petitioners and other
similarly situated SI/DE selected
through CPOs Exam-2002 (as per list
enclosed at Appendix A) as members of
the old pension scheme, which was in
vogue till 31/12/2003 and the NPS
corpus which were earlier subscribed
should be transferred to the GPF
accounts of each individual, subject to
the condition that they will not be
entitled for any back wages or seniority
etc.”
8. Subsequently, after a judgment dated
27th March 2017 of this Court in the case
W.P.(C) 12712/2021 & connected petitions                          Page 37 of 58
of Inspectors of the BSF in W.P. (C) 2810 of 2016
(Inspector Rajendra Singh v. Union of India), the
Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) issued an Office
Memorandum (OM) dated 13th April 2018,
accepting the said judgment for implementation
and inter alia directing as under:
“5. Now, Competent authority
desires that all other CAPFs
(except BSF) may also check their
record and if any similar case is
found they may examine & take
appropriate action on the similar
lines by taking reliance of BSF
case, to avoid similar litigation in
future.”
9. Another order dated 16th October 2018 was
issued by the BSF implementing the decisions of
this Court extending the benefit of the OPS in the
case of Head Constable (Radio Operators) who
had been selected prior to 1st January 2004 but
issued appointment letters thereafter.
10. This Court, in the context of certain
Constables of BSF, by a judgment dated
12th February, 2019 in W.P. (C) 6680 of 2017
(Tanaka Ram v. Union of India) allowed the
prayers of those Petitioners and held that they
should be covered by the OPS. The order of this
Court in Tanaka Ram (supra) was affirmed by the
Supreme Court by dismissal of SLP (CC)
Diary No. 25228/2019 (Union of India v. Tanaka
Ram) on 2nd September 2019.
Choudhary v. Union of India), relief similar to the
one sought in the present case was being claimed
by certain Assistant Commandants in the CRPF,
who had successfully cleared the examinations of
W.P.(C) 12712/2021 & connected petitions                          Page 38 of 58
2003. They were, however, offered letters of
appointment after January, 2004. By an order
dated 9th April, 2019, their petition was allowed
by this Court. That order has been affirmed by the
Supreme Court inasmuch as SLP(C) 31539/2019
filed by Union of India has been dismissed by an
order dated 27th November, 2019.
12. In that view of the matter, the Court finds
no reason to treat the present Petitioners who
belong to the SSB, another CAPF, different from
their counterparts in the CRPF and BSF.
13. The Court accordingly allows the present
petition and quashes the order dated 25th January,
2018 passed by the Respondents by which the
Petitioners' representation dated 8th September
2017, requesting that the OPS be extended to
them, was rejected. A direction is issued to the
Respondents to extend the benefit of the OPS to
each of the Petitioners in terms of CCS (Pension)
Rules 1972, by issuing appropriate orders within
a period of 12 weeks from today.”
29.     It is a matter of record that against the aforesaid decisions,
respondents preferred SLP as well as review petitions, which were
dismissed by the Supreme Court. Thereby, it is the settled position of law
that those candidates who had appeared in the selection process prior to
coming into force the NPS on 22.12.2003, but were offered letters of
appointment after 01.01.2004, would be covered by the OPS.
30.     The respondents, on the other hand, have relied upon decision in
Satya Dev Prajapati (Supra). In the said case, though the advertisements
for different posts was issued in the year 2003 but the written
examination, skill test and viva voce could be completed in May, 2004
W.P.(C) 12712/2021 & connected petitions                          Page 39 of 58
and the appointment letters were issued between May, 2004 till August,
2004. So, the petitioners had filed the aforesaid writ petitions seeking
benefit of OPS, which was denied by the department in view of Office
Memorandum dated 17.02.2020, whereby the benefit of OPS was
confined to only those candidates who were recruited against vacancies
arising on or before 31.12.2003 and the selection results were declared on
or before 01.01.2004. The Coordinate Division Bench of this Court while
relying upon OM dated 17.02.2020 refused to grant the benefit of OPS to
the petitioners therein holding that the Central Government had thought it
fit to extend the benefit of the Old Pension Scheme to those employees,
where the selection results (for filing up vacancies that had arisen) were
declared before 01.01.2004.                The Coordinate Bench in Satya Dev
Prajapati (Supra) took note of the decisions in Naveen Kumar Jha
Rajendra Singh (Supra), Niraj Kumar Singh and Others (Supra) and
Avinash Singh (Supra); relied upon by petitioners as well as in these
petitions and observed that:-
“47.        It is clear from the above analysis that the
petitioners rely upon cases that follow the decision
in the case of Naveen Kumar Jha v. Union of India,
which in turn referred to the decision in the case
of Avinash Singh v. Union of India As noted above,
the decision in Naveen Kumar Jha v. Union of
India was based on the principle that there could be
no discrimination between a batch of candidates that
participated in the given recruitment process. On the
principles of parity, the Court did not accept that the
benefits of the Old Pension Scheme would be
available to some of the candidates and not to others
for no reasons attributable to them. It is also
W.P.(C) 12712/2021 & connected petitions                            Page 40 of 58
material to note that all of the cases referred to by
the petitioners were essentially cases pertaining to
recruitment to the paramilitary forces. The
controversy in these cases had arisen largely on
account of a delay in the petitioners joining their
services either because the letters of joining had
been issued later or a delay in the completion of the
procedure for their medical fitness, which had
placed them in a disadvantageous position vis-a-vis
other similarly placed candidates. It was also found
that there was a difference in the dates of issuing
appointment letters to candidates based on the
paramilitary service to which they were appointed.
31.     Since the Coordinate Division Bench itself has noted in Para-47 of
Satya Dev Prajapati (Supra) that the cases referred to were related to
paramilitary forces where there was huge delay caused on completion of
recruitment process and so, the petitioners therein were given appointment
on parity, whereas the petitioners in Satya Dev Prajapati (Supra) were
covered under the Central Government Rules and so were denied benefit
of OPS, the said decision is of no help to the case of respondents being
distinguishable on facts.
32.     To persuade this Court that the petitioners, deployed under different
Forces, were members of Armed Forces and hence, covered under the
OPS, learned petitioners‟ counsel had submitted before this Court that
under Article 246 read with List 1 Entry 2 of the Seventh Schedule of
Constitution of India, the Armed Forces of the Union of India included the
Naval, Military and Air Forces and any other armed forces of the Union.
Further submitted that even the Central Reserve Police Force was raised
as an Armed Force of Union of India and is governed by a special Act
W.P.(C) 12712/2021 & connected petitions                          Page 41 of 58
called CRPF Act, 1968.
33.     The provisions of Section 3(1) of the CRPF Act, 1949 stipulate that
the CRPF is a part of armed forces. It reads as under:-
3. Constitution of the Force.-(l) There shall
continue to be an armed force maintained by
the Central Government and called the
34.     Furthermore, Article 246 read with List 1 Entry 2 of the Seventh
Schedule of Constitution of India envisages Armed Forces of the Union of
India and includes “Naval, Military and Air Forces; any other armed
forces of the Union”.
35.     Also, learned counsel for petitioners had drawn attention of this
Court to Notification dated 22.12.2003 issued by the Ministry of Finance,
Government of India as well as Circular dated 6th August, 2004 issued by
the Ministry of Home Affairs, Government of India.
36.     The Contributory Pension Scheme was introduced vide Notification
dated 22.12.2003, which was to be implemented w.e.f. 01.01.2004. The
Notification dated 22.12.2003 reads as under:-
(Department of Economic Affairs)
New Delhi, the 22nd December, 2003
approved on 23rd August, 2003 the proposal to
implement the budget announcement of 2003-2004
W.P.(C) 12712/2021 & connected petitions                          Page 42 of 58
relating to introducing a new restructured defined
contribution pension system for new entrants to
Central Government service, except to Armed Force,
in the first stage, replacing the existing system of
defined benefit pension system.
(i) The system would be mandatory for all new
recruits to the central Government service from 1st of
January, 2004 (except the armed forces in the first
stage). The monthly contribution would be 10
percent of the salary and DA to be paid by the
employee and matched by the Central Government.
However, there will be no contribution from the
Government in respect of individuals who are not
Government employees. The contributions and
investment returns would be deposited in a non-
withdrawable pension tier-I account. The existing
provisions of defined benefit pension and GPF would
not be available to the new recruits in the central
Government service.
(ii)        In addition to the above pension account,
each individual may also have a voluntary tier-II
withdrawable account at his option. This option is
given as GPF will be withdrawn for new recruits in
Central Government service. Government will make
no contribution into this account. These assets
would be managed through exactly the above
procedures. However, the employee would be free to
withdraw part or all of the „second tier‟ of his money
anytime. This withdrawable account does not
constitute pension investment, and would attract no
special tax treatment.
(iii)       Individuals can normally exist at or after
age 60 years for tier-I of the pension system. At exit
the individual would be mandatorily required to
W.P.(C) 12712/2021 & connected petitions                          Page 43 of 58
invest 40 percent of pension wealth to purchase an
annuity (from an IRDA-regulated life insurance
company). In case of Government employees the
annuity should provide for pension for the lifetime of
the employee and his dependent parents and his
spouse at the time of retirement. The individual
would receive a lump-sum of the remaining pension
wealth, which he would be free to utilize in any
manner. Individuals would have the flexibility to
leave the pension system prior to age 60. However,
in this case, the mandatory annuitisation would be
80% of the pension wealth.
Architecture of the New Pension System
(iv)        It will have a central record keeping and
accounting (CRA) infrastructure, several pension
fund managers (PFMs) to offer three categories of
schemes viz. option A, B and C.
(v)         The participating entities (PFMs and CRA)
would give out easily understood information about
past performances, so that the individual would able
to make informed choices about which scheme to
choose.
2. The effective date for operationalisation of the
new pension system shall be from 1st of January,
37.     A perusal of aforesaid Notification dated 22.12.2003 shows that in
Para (i) thereof it has been categorically mentioned that „the system would
be mandatory for all new recruits to the central Government service from
1st of January 2004 (except the armed forces in the first stage)”. Meaning
thereby that the Scheme was not applicable to Armed Forces and the
W.P.(C) 12712/2021 & connected petitions                          Page 44 of 58
Armed Forces will be governed by the Old Pension Scheme already
existing. Also, the said Notification stipulated that the scheme shall not be
applicable to Armed Forces and they shall be governed by the Old
Pension Scheme already existing.
38.     The Supreme Court in Akhilesh Prasad Vs. Union Territory of
Mizoram, (1981) 2 SCC 150, has held as under:-
“10. The first question which falls for
determination by us is as to whether the
appellant was a member of the “Armed Forces
of the Union” within the meaning of that
expression as occurring in sub-section (2) of
Section 197 of the Criminal Procedure Code.
The expression “Armed Forces” has been
defined in clause (a) of sub-section (3) of
Section 132 CrPC as meaning the military,
naval and air forces, operating as land forces
and as including any other armed forces of the
Union so operating. That definition however, is
limited in its application, by the express
language of that clause itself, to the
interpretation of Sections 129 to 132 of the
Criminal Procedure Code and the argument,
therefore, advanced in support of the impugned
judgment that that definition will not govern the
interpretation of Section 197 cannot be said to
lack plausibility. Nor has it been shown to us
that the expression “Armed Forces of the
Union” as occurring in sub-section (2) of
Section 197 CrPC is governed by a definition
occurring elsewhere (either in the Criminal
Procedure Code or in any other statute). In this
situation it must be given its ordinary meaning
which, it appears to us, would certainly not be
limited to the inclusion of only the military,
naval and air forces of the Union. In this
W.P.(C) 12712/2021 & connected petitions                          Page 45 of 58
connection a reference to the contents of Entry
2 in List I of the Seventh Schedule to the
Constitution of India may be made with
advantage. They are: “Naval, military and air
forces; any other armed forces of the Union”.
The entry clearly envisages armed forces other
than the three well known forces of the State,
namely the naval, military and air forces. All
that remains to be done, therefore, is to find out
answers to the following two questions:
(a) Is the CRPF a force?
(b) If question (a) is answered in the
affirmative, whether CRPF is an armed force?
In our opinion the answer to both the questions
must be given in the affirmative in view of the
provisions of sub-section (1) of Section 3 of the
CRPF Act which unfortunately do not appear
to have been brought to the notice of the
learned Single Judge. That sub-section reads
thus: “There shall continue to be an armed
force maintained by the Central Government
and called the Central Reserve Police Force.”
11. The sub-section itself declares in no
uncertain terms that the CRPF is an armed
force of the Central Government which is the
same thing as saying that it is a part of the
“Armed Forces of the Union”. We may make it
clear, however, that even if the provisions just
above extracted were not available our answer
to the two questions would still be in the
affirmative. The reason given by the learned
Single Judge for holding a contrary opinion,
namely, that the force was “only a reserve
force and not a regular force” by which
expression he appears to mean that it was not a
continually operating force does not command
our concurrence. Just because the CRPF is a
reserve force it does not follow that it is not a
W.P.(C) 12712/2021 & connected petitions                           Page 46 of 58
regularly operating force and no provision of
the Central Reserve Police Force Act has been
pointed out to us such as may lend support to a
contrary view.
12. We hold that the CRPF squarely falls
within the expression “Armed Forces of the
Union” as used in sub-section (2) of Section
167 of the CrPC.”
39.     The decision in Akhilesh Prasad (Supra), clearly shows that CRPF
is a part of armed Forces. Also, the Ministry of Home Affairs,
Government of India, vide Circular dated 6th August, 2004 clarified that
the Central Forces under the administrative control of the Ministry of
Home Affairs have been declared as Armed Forces of the Union. The
Circular dated 6th August, 2004 notified as under:-
The Chief Secretary of all the States/UTs
Subject:-Clarification about Armed Forces of Union
regarding Central Police Force.
There has been query in the past from State
Government regarding clarification about Armed
Force of Union regarding Central Police Force. In this
regard, I am directed to mention the following Central
Force; under the administrative control of the Ministry
of Home Affairs have been declared an Armed Force of
the Union.
Vide Section 4 of the Border Security Force Act,

Vide section 3 of the Central Industrial Security
Force Act, 1968 (Amended by Act 14 of 1983).
3. Central Reserve Police force
Vide Section 3 of the Central Reserve Police Force,
Vide Section 4 of the Indo Tibetan Border Police
Vide Section 4 of the National Security Guard Act,
2. In addition, Assam Reifies and SSB are also two
Central Forces under Ministry of Home Affairs which
perform under guarding and internal security duties
New Acts for governing these forces are under process
and the Bill will be introduced in parliament shortly.
The status of these forces is also equivalent to that of
other Central Force under Ministry of Home Affairs
mentioned above. Hence, they may also be allowed
similar benefits.
40.     Thereafter, the Department of Pension and PW, Government of
India issued another Office Memorandum dated 17.02.2020, relevant
portion thereof reads as under:-
New Delhi, the 17th February, 2020
Subject: Coverage under Central Civil Services
(Pension) Rules, 1972, in place of National Pension

System, of those Central Government employees
whose selection for appointment was finalized
before 01.01.2004 but who joined Government
service on or after 01.01.2004
The undersigned is directed to say that
consequent on introduction of National Pension
System (NPS) vide Ministry of Finance (Department
of Economic Affairs) Notification No.5/7/2003-ECB
& PR dated 22.12.2003, all Government servants
appointed on or after 01.01.2004 to the post in the
Central Government service (except armed forces)
are mandatorily covered under the scheme. The
Central Civil Services (Pension) Rules, 1972 and
other connected rules were also amended vide
Notification dated 30.12.2003 and, after the said
amendment, those rules are not applicable to the
Government servants appointed to Government
service after 31.12.2003.”
41.     A perusal of the afore-noted Notification dated 22.12.2003;
Clarification letter dated 06.08.2004 and Office Memorandum dated
17.12.2020 shows that the BSF, CISF, CRPF, ITBP, NSG, Assam Rifles
and SSB are part of Central Forces under the Ministry of Home Affairs
and Notification dated 22.12.2003 shall not be applicable on personnel of
these Forces.
42.     At this juncture, we wish to indicate upon another Office
Memorandum dated 13.04.2018, issued by the Ministry of Home affairs,
Government of India, which is as under:-
Government of India
W.P.(C) 12712/2021 & connected petitions                          Page 49 of 58
Dated, the 13th April, 2018
Sub:        Regarding implementation of the Court
order passed in WP(C) No.3834/2013 titled
Parmanand Vadav & 125 others v. UOI and other
& W.P.(C) 2810/2016 titled Inspector Rajendra
Singh & 29 others Vs. UOI and other before the
Hon'ble High Court of Delhi.
SSC conducted CPO's (SI) Exam during the year
2002, for which final result was declared in the
month of August, 2003. BSF issued an offer of
appointment during the month of December 2003
directing candidates to report Training Centres in
the month of January, 2004.
2. In the meantime, the Government of India had
introduced the New Pension Scheme vide GOI
Notification dtd. 22.12.2003, which is applicable to
the personnel who have entered into Government
service w.e.f. 01.01.2004 and onwards.
3. Some BSF candidates approached Hon'ble High
Court of Delhi with a prayer that issuing
appointment letter after 01.01.2004 is the
Administrative lapse on the part of CAPFs/BSF,
hence, they may be extended the benefits of Old
Pension Scheme by way of filing WP(C)
No.3834/2013 & WP(C) 2810/2016 before the
Hon'ble High Court of Delhi, which was allowed
vide order dtd. 12.02.2015 &. 27.03.2017
respectively.
4. This Ministry after detailed deliberation & in
Consultation of DoLA & DoP & PW agree to
implement the Judgment i.e. to extend the benefits of
Old Pension Scheme without any back wages
seniority in case of petitioner & other similar placed
W.P.(C) 12712/2021 & connected petitions                          Page 50 of 58
left over candidates.
5. Now, Competent authority desires that all other
CAPFs (except BSF) may also check their record
and if any similar case is found they may examine &
take appropriate action on the similar lines by taking
reliance of BSF case, to avoid similar litigation in
future.”
43.     The extract of afore-noted Office Memorandum shows that the
Ministry of Home Affairs had directed all the CAPFs to extend the benefit
of OPS to the petitioners in W.P.(C) 3834/2013, Paramnand Yadav
(Supra) to the petitioners therein as well as other similarly situated
personnel. However, respondents in their counter affidavit have taken the
stand that pursuant to decision of this Court in W.P.(C) 1358/2017,
Shyam Kumar Chaudhary (Supra) dated 09.04.2019, the DoP& PW
noted that there were factual errors in the said decision and so, decided to
implement the order of the this Court only to the case of petitioners in the
said petitions. Learned counsel for the respondents submitted that the
direction to grant OPS to the petitioners therein was in persona and not in
rem. Whereas, the Supreme Court in State of U.P. and Ors. Vs. Arvind
Kumar Srivastava and Ors. 2015 (1) SCC 347 has held that when a set of
employees has been given relief by the Court, then all other identically
placed persons need to be treated alike by extending the benefit to them.
The plea of respondents that there were factual errors in judgment dated
09.04.2019 passed in W.P.(C) No. 1358/2017, is highly unacceptable to
this Court, in view of the fact that the said order was upheld by the
W.P.(C) 12712/2021 & connected petitions                          Page 51 of 58
44.     It is pertinent to mention here that learned counsel arguing on
behalf of the petitioners had laid much emphasis on the contents of
Notification dated 22.12.2003 and OM dated 17.02.2020, wherein it has
been specifically mentioned that the NPS shall be applicable on the
Central Government employees, „except armed forces‟. Learned counsel
submitted that in all the earlier decisions rendered by the Courts, the
contents of Notification dated 22.12.2003 and OM dated 17.02.2020 have
not been dealt with. Thus, the larger issue that the Notification dated
22.10.2003 is applicable only upon Central Government employees and
not „armed forces‟, has not been dealt at all.
45.     To refute submission of petitioners‟ counsel, learned Standing
Counsel submitted that in all the earlier decisions by this Court as well as
other High Courts, the Notification dated 22.12.2003 and OM dated
17.02.2020 have been referred and eligible personnel have been given
benefit of OPS. Learned Standing Counsel had insisted upon the fact that
in the appointment letters issued to the petitioners, it has been mentioned
that the “appointee shall be governed by the new pension scheme
introduced by the Government of India vide M.F. (CGA) OM No.1(7) (2)
2003 TA-11 dated 7-1-2004 read with OM No.1(7) (2) (2003) TA 67-74
dated 4-2-2004.”
46.     On this aspect we find that the appointment letters have been issued
to the petitioners in the year 2004-2005 after conclusion of the selection
process, which took extra inordinate long time as the advertisement /
notification for appointment was released in the year 2002 & 2003 for
different posts in the Forces. It is not misplaced to mention here that the
W.P.(C) 12712/2021 & connected petitions                          Page 52 of 58
advertisement [in W.P.(C) No. 12712/2021 i.e. the lead matter] inviting
applications       for     recruitment         of     Assistant    Commandant       in
BSF/CRPF/ITBP/SSB noted that “ on joining an organization a candidate
shall be governed by the Act and Rules as applicable to that organization
and as amended from time to time”.
47.     It is the settled position that appointments have to be strictly made
in terms stipulated in the advertisement and any breach would tantamount
to vitiation of the selection process.
48.     In a recent decision in ASI/Pharma Biswa Prakash Jena Vs.
Union of India, (2022) 5 HCC (Del) 319 : 2022 SCC OnLine Del 2544,
wherein one of us (Suresh Kumar Kait, J) being member while dealing
with a case where the petitioners working as Pharmacist in CRPF had
sought parity with Pharmacist in ITBP, which was denied to them by the
Union of India on the ground that they were appointed beyond the period
of advertisement and selection process, had relied upon decisions in
Parmanand Yadav (Supra), Avinash Singh (Supra) and Rajendra Singh
(Supra) and held as under:-
“11. The respondents cannot change the terms and
conditions of service which were applicable at the
time of advertisement to the prejudice of the
petitioners and that too after their recruitment
process is long over. It is trite law that terms and
conditions of service applicable at the time of
notification of the post cannot be altered to the
prejudice of the incumbents to the post after the
selection process is completed, as in the instant case.
W.P.(C) 12712/2021 & connected petitions                                Page 53 of 58
15. In the case on hand before us, admittedly, the
advertisement was issued much prior to the alleged
cut-off date i.e. 29-3-2004 and the recruitment
process of the aforesaid petitioners already stood
concluded on 26-2-2004 prior thereto. Further the
petitioners cannot be penalised for the delay in their
appointment after the alleged cut-off date.
Furthermore, the petitioners will not and in fact
should not lose their seniority because of the
lethargy of the respondents when they cannot be
blamed for it and therefore the respondents cannot
take benefit of their own wrong.
16.         Accordingly, we hold that the denial of the
extension of the benefits by the respondents to the
petitioners is discriminatory and arbitrary and thus
violative of Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution of
49.    Also, a Coordinate Division Bench of this Court in W.P.(C) No.
10028/2009, titled as Amarendra Kumar Vs. Union of India & Ors.,
decided on 02.08.2010 on the similar issue of grant of OPS observed and
held as under:-
“23.        There is an additional ground which
persuades us to hold that the respondents have not
been fair to the petitioner. It is an admitted
position also that the Defined Benefit Pension
System of the respondents came to an end on 31st
24.         The new Defined Contribution Pension
Scheme which came into effect from 1st April,
2004 requires a monthly contribution from the
salary equivalent to 10% of the salary and
W.P.(C) 12712/2021 & connected petitions                           Page 54 of 58
dearness allowance.
25.         The impact of issuance of the
appointment letter with effect from 27th April,
2004 would be that the petitioner would be
deprived of the benefit of the earlier scheme which
came to an end on 31st December 2003. He would
therefore be required to make a monthly
contribution from his salary in accordance with
the new scheme. Compared against the earlier
scheme, this could certainly work tremendous
financial loss to the petitioner.
26.         The justification of the respondents to the
effect that the delay occurred because the matter
was pending for correspondence with higher
authorities is also not supported by the record.
There is no warrant at all for shuttling the
petitioner between the Group Centre and Staff
Selection Committee and back when the medical
facility for undertaking the X-ray was available at
the Group Centre. In addition, it is not as if the
respondents were continuously in correspondence
over a period of four and a half months since the
issuance of the provisional appointment letter.
27.         We may also note that the provisional
letter of appointment dated 24th November, 2003
does state that the appointment is provisional.
However the only consequence thereof is that
upon the completion of the stated formalities,
issuance of the formal appointment letter would
follow. The appointment obviously has to relate
back to the date of his original appointment.
28.         In view of above discussion, it has to be
held that the petitioner is deemed to have been
regularly appointed with effect from 22nd
December, 2003. The petitioner would also be
entitled to the benefit of the Defined Pension
Scheme which was valid till 31st December, 2003.
The respondents are required to ensure that all
W.P.(C) 12712/2021 & connected petitions                           Page 55 of 58
benefits which are admissible to the petitioner
pursuant to the appointment with effect from 22nd
December, 2003 including seniority, etc. are made
available to him.”
50.     The afore-noted decisions in ASI/Pharma Biswa Prakash Jena and
Amarendra Kumar (Supra), make it clear that the terms which governed
at the time of issuance of advertisement for appointment, shall hold the
field for the applicants.
51.     There is no dispute to the position that at the time of publication of
the advertisements, the OPS was in force. Also, when the advertisement
itself states that the selected candidates shall be governed by the Act and
Rules in force and thereafter, the Notification dated 22.12.2003 and OM
dated 17.02.2020 specifically mention that the all the Central Government
employees “except the armed forces”, shall be governed by the NPS,
therefore, we do not find any reason for respondents to issue the
appointment letters to the personnel of armed forces mentioning that “the
appointee shall be governed by the new pension scheme introduced by the
Government of India”. When vide Circular dated 6th August, 2004 issued
by the Ministry of Home Affairs, Government of India has itself declared
that the Central Forces under the administrative control of Ministry of
Home Affairs are armed Forces of Union, the position cannot be disputed
that the Armed Forces shall remain excluded from coverage under
Notification dated 22.12.2003. We find that despite the fact that „armed
forces‟ are exception to Notification dated 22.12.2003, , however, without
application of mind, have mentioned in the appointment letters of the
candidates that the recruits shall be governed by NPS. Apparently, Article
W.P.(C) 12712/2021 & connected petitions                           Page 56 of 58
246 read with List 1 Entry 2 of the VII Schedule of Constitution of India
envisages Armed Forces of the Union of India includes “Naval, Military
and Air Forces; any other armed forces of the Union”, so, the personnel of
CAPFs deserve to get the benefit of OPS, as has been granted vide
Notification dated 22.12.2003.
52.     The Hon‟ble Supreme Court and High Courts in various decisions
have appreciated the role of armed forces in safeguarding our country.
Having great respect for the personnel of forces, the Courts as well as
Government of India, have always ensured that any policy decision should
not be detrimental to their interest. The contents of Notification dated
22.12.2003 as well as OM dated 17.02.2020 clearly demonstrate that
when policy decision to implement NPS was taken, the armed Forces of
the country were kept out of its domain. Accordingly, we are of the
considered opinion that the Notification dated 22.12.2003 as well as OM
dated 17.02.2020 are required to be implemented in their true essence.
53.     In the light of what we have observed above, we find that
Notification dated 22.12.2003 as well as OM dated 17.02.2020 create a
bar upon the respondents to not implement the Notification dated
22.12.2003, whereby New Contributory Pension Scheme („NPS‟) has
been executed w.e.f. 01.01.2004, upon the personnel of the paramilitary
Forces i.e. Central Reserve Police Force („CRPF‟), Sashtra Seema Bal
(„SSB‟), Border Security Force („BSF‟) and Central Industrial Security
Force („CISF‟) Indo Tibetan Border Police („ITBP‟) (CAPFs) etc.
Consequentially, the impugned Office Memorandums, Signals and
Orders, to the extent it deny the benefit of Old Pension Scheme to the

petitioners and similarly situated personnel of the armed forces, are
hereby quashed.
54.     A mandamus by way of direction is accordingly issued to the
respondents to issue an Order to CAPFs mentioned above to implement
the Notification dated 22.12.2003 as well as OM dated 17.02.2020 in
essence noted above. It is made clear that the Notification dated
22.12.2003 as well as OM dated 17.02.2020 granting the benefit of Old
Pension Scheme shall be applicable in rem. Meaning thereby, Old Pension
Scheme shall not only be applicable in the case of petitioners herein but
all the personnel of CAPFs at large. Accordingly, necessary orders be
issued within eight weeks.
55.     With aforesaid directions, these petitions and pending application,
if any, are accordingly disposed of.
