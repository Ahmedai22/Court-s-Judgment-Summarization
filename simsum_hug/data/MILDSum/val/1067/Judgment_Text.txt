1.     The instant contempt petition has been filed for the alleged willful
violation of the orders dated 15.10.2020 and 21.12.2020, passed by this
Court in W.P.(C) No. 7356/2021 & CM No. 33867/2020.
2.     The facts, in brief, leading to the instant contempt petition are as
a)   Aggrieved by the non-consideration of her application for
putting up a boundary wall to secure her property in terms of
Digitally Signed        CONT.CAS(C) 92/2022                                            Page 1 of 10
the revenue land records, the Petitioner herein approached this
Court by filing W.P.(C) No. 7356/2021.
b)  Notice was issued on the writ petition and a Status Report was
filed by the Police. The Status Report has been reproduced in
the order dated 15.10.2020. After considering the Status Report,
this Court on 15.10.2020 passed the following order:
“5. The photographs show that the petitioner’s
property is unprotected and can be walked into
and put to misuse by anybody. It is in nobody’s
interest that the place be open to mischief.
Therefore, in the interest of the parties, it should
be secured in such a manner that all mischief is
obviated. The petitioner is ready and willing to
give an undertaking to the effect that if the
boundary wall is secured, she will remove it in
terms of such order as may be passed by the
Deputy Commissioner Revenue, in her appeal and
applications which are pending for more than half
a decade.
6. In the circumstances, let the Deputy
Commissioner dispose-off her appeal and/or her
application for securing her property in terms of
the above, preferably within a period of 2 months
from today. The parties may be heard through
video conferencing, through counsel.”
c)  As proper police protection had not been granted to the
Petitioner, the Petitioner moved an application, being CM
APPL. 33867/2020, seeking directions. The said application
was considered by this Court on 21.12.2020 wherein this Court,
in terms of the order dated 15.10.2020, directed the Police to
grant protection to the Petitioner at the time of construction of
Digitally Signed        CONT.CAS(C) 92/2022                                         Page 2 of 10
the boundary wall. Relevant portion of the said order reads as
“4.     The      learned    counsel      for    the
applicant/petitioner submits that the boundary
wall has not been constructed as the petitioner
was awaiting due action by the respondents.
5. The Court would note that assurance was given
by the learned ASC for the State that status quo
apropos the petitioner’s possession of the
property would be secured. Since the petitioner is
stated to be in possession of the property by the
learned ASC for the State, let the boundary wall
be constructed to secure the property in terms of
the previous order as soon as possible, with due
intimation to the learned ASC for the State. Albeit,
the same would be without prejudice to the rights
and contentions of the parties, in particular those
of R-6, who states that some possession has been
given to him.
6. The objective of the aforesaid exercise is that
the property be secured from mischief. The
appropriate undertaking as indicated in para 5 of
the aforesaid order, shall be furnished by the
petitioner before the Deputy Commissioner
(Revenue) and a copy thereof shall be filed in this
Court within one month.
7. The learned ASC for the State states that
because of COVID-19 pandemic related
administrative exigencies, the demarcation could
not be carried out. Therefore, he seeks and is
granted 3 more weeks’ time to comply with the
order, with due notice to the parties. An
endeavour shall also be made to dispose-off the
petitioner’s appeal within a period of 5 months

d)      It is stated that the boundary wall was constructed on
24.12.2020, and in terms of the orders dated 15.10.2020 and
21.12.2020, passed by this Court in W.P.(C) No. 7356/2021 &
CM No. 33867/2020, an undertaking was given by the
Petitioner on 23.12.2020 that in case it was found that the
boundary wall had not been constructed in terms of the orders
of this Court or if the Deputy Commissioner, Revenue, so
ordered, the Petitioner would demolish the boundary wall.
e)      It is stated that on 03.01.2022, the Respondent No.1 herein,
with the aid of certain persons, arrived at the premises and
demolished the boundary wall constructed by the Petitioner.
f)      It is stated that the Petitioner lodged an FIR against the
Respondent No.1 at Police Station Burari, being FIR
No.17/2022, dated 04.01.2022 for offences under Sections
448/511 IPC, and also approached this Court by filing the
instant contempt petition.
g)      It is pertinent to note that Charge-sheet in the abovementioned
FIR for offences under Sections 447/448/451/511/34 IPC was
filed on 04.05.2022 before the learned MM, Tis Hazari Courts.
3.   Notice in the instant contempt petition was issued on 27.01.2022
wherein this Court observed as under:
“7. An FIR dated 04.01.2022, has been lodged against
respondent no.1 by the petitioner. It is odd that the
local police have done nothing in the matter, despite a
lapse of 23 days since registration of the FIR. Surely, a
prompt and robust response was expected from the
Digitally Signed        CONT.CAS(C) 92/2022                                            Page 4 of 10
police, especially when the wall had been built up in
terms of the court's orders, with due intimation to the
police and the State.
8. Let the DCP look into the matter and file an affidavit
before the next date. The learned ASC for GNCTD
submits that the needful shall be done.
9. Issue notice to respondent No.1 through ordinary
process, approved courier, Speed Post, WhatsApp, e-
mail, SMS, Signal, and other viable modes of
electronic service, through counsel as well, returnable
on 07.03.2022.”
4.    On 07.03.2022, this Court found that the Petitioner is guilty of
contempt of Court and the apology tendered by the Respondent
No.1/Contemnor was rejected by this Court on the ground that the manner in
which the demolition was done by the Respondent No.1/Contemnor with the
help of a JCB excavator machine, as evidenced in the photographs
reproduced in the said order, portrayed that the demolition was a willful and
deliberate act on the part of the Respondent No.1/Contemnor to flout the
orders of this Court. Relevant portion of the said order reads as under:
“2. At the outset, the learned counsel for the R-1
submits that the wall demolished by the said
respondent was possibly due to misconstruing of the
court's directions, for which an apology is tendered.
When the demolition was being carried out, with the
assistance of a JCB excavator machine, as evidenced
in the photographs, reproduced in the aforesaid order,
the local police was intimated about the same and they
reached the site.
3. The court is informed that an FIR has been
registered. The court is informed that the wall has been
Digitally Signed        CONT.CAS(C) 92/2022                                            Page 5 of 10
rebuilt by the petitioner with due protection being
provided by the local police at the initiative of the SHO
himself. He assures a thorough investigation in the
matter. The court is also assured by the learned
counsel for the State, that the charge-sheet, as may be,
shall be filed shortly.
4. The learned counsel for the petitioner submits that
the expenses for building up the wall are in the amount
of Rs. 10,000/-. Let the said monies be paid by R-1 to
the petitioner.
5. Insofar as the wall was built under the directions of
the court, and the built wall is a part of record of this
court, R-1 could not possibly have demolished it on his
own. It was always open to R-1 to approach the court
for variation in the order and/or to intimate the court,
that he believed that the petitioner had mislead the
court. Instead, R-1 has taken the law in his hands and
has with much fanfare demolished the wall by a JCB
excavator machine and has breached the court's
directions. In the circumstances, R-1 is held guilty of
having committed contempt of court under sections
2(b) and 12 of Contempt of Courts Act, 1971.
6. The oral apology tendered by R-1 lacks remorse and
is accordingly rejected.
7. List for orders on sentencing on 11.05.2022.
8. The local police assures the court of due protection
of the petitioner who is apprehensive of harm from R-
5.     The matter was fixed for orders on sentencing on 11.05.2022. On
11.05.2022, the matter was adjourned to 12.05.2022, and thereafter to today,
i.e. 13.05.2022.

6.    Heard Ms. Vertika Sharma, learned counsel for the Petitioner, Mr.
Debopriyo Moulik, learned counsel for the Respondent No.1/Contemnor,
and Mr. Sameer Vashisht, learned ASC(Civil) GNCTD, and perused the
material on record.
7.    Learned counsel for the Respondent No.1/Contemnor contends that
the property of the Petitioner is adjacent to the property of the Respondent
No.1 and there is a dispute between them regarding demarcation of the
property. He, therefore, submits that demolition was conducted because
Respondent No.1 was under the misconception that the wall had been
constructed on his land. He tenders an unconditional apology and prays that
the Respondent No.1 ought not be punished under the Contempt of Courts
8.    The submissions of the learned counsel for the Respondent
No.1/Contemnor cannot be accepted by this Court.            The order dated
15.10.2020 was passed in the presence of the Respondent No.1/Contemnor
wherein the Petitioner was directed to construct a boundary wall. Order
dated 21.12.2020, granting protection to the Petitioner herein, was also
passed in the presence of the Respondent No.1/Contemnor. The Respondent
No.1/Contemnor cannot now plead ignorance regarding the area where the
boundary wall had been constructed.
9.    The boundary wall was constructed on 23.12.2020. Photographs
evidencing the said construction have been filed along with the instant
contempt petition (Annexure CP-3). Admittedly, the dispute as to whether
the boundary wall has been constructed on the property of the Petitioner or
on the property of the Respondent No.1/Contemnor is pending before the
Deputy Commissioner, Revenue. Demolition of the boundary wall took
Digitally Signed        CONT.CAS(C) 92/2022                                           Page 7 of 10
place on 03.01.2022, i.e. after more than a year of the construction of the
boundary wall. This action, therefore, was not in the heat of the moment
and, therefore, can only be construed as an attempt by the Respondent
No.1/Contemnor to willfully flout the orders passed by this Court.
10.   The manner in which the demolition took place, i.e. by using a JCB
excavator and with the aid of other people, also indicate that the Respondent
No.1/Contemnor harboured the intention to terrorize the Petitioner. This
demonstrates that the Respondent No.1/Contemnor possess scant regard
towards the orders of the Court, and has undermined the dignity of the Court
and outraged the majesty of law.           The action of the Respondent
No.1/Contemnor cannot be said to be an outcome of confusion regarding the
site where the boundary wall has been constructed, especially when the
matter was still under consideration before the Deputy Commissioner,
Revenue. In any event, the Petitioner had given an undertaking that in case it
was found that the boundary wall is not constructed in terms of the orders of
this Court or if the Deputy Commissioner, Revenue, so orders, the Petitioner
would demolish the boundary wall.
11.   The Supreme Court in the case of In Re: Vinay Chandra, (1995) 2
SCC 584, had delineated the purpose of the law of contempt in building
confidence in the judicial process. The relevant paragraph of the said
judgement has been reproduced as follows:
“39. The rule of law is the foundation of a democratic
society. The Judiciary is the guardian of the rule of law.
Hence judiciary is not only the third pillar, but the
central pillar of the democratic State. In a democracy
like ours, where there is a written Constitution which is
above all individuals and institutions and where the
power of judicial review is vested in the superior courts,
Digitally Signed        CONT.CAS(C) 92/2022                                            Page 8 of 10
the judiciary has a special and additional duty to
perform, viz., to oversee that all individuals and
institutions including the executive and the legislature act
within the framework of not only the law but also the
fundamental law of the land. This duty is apart from the
function of adjudicating the disputes between the parties
which is essential to peaceful and orderly development of
the society. If the judiciary is to perform its duties and
functions effectively and remain true to the spirit with
which they are sacredly entrusted to it, the dignity and
authority of the courts have to be respected and protected
at all costs. Otherwise, the very cornerstone of our
constitutional scheme will give way and with it will
disappear the rule of law and the civilized life in the
society. It is for this purpose that the courts are entrusted
with the extraordinary power of punishing those who
indulge in acts whether inside or outside the courts,
which tend to undermine their authority and bring them
in disrepute and disrespect by scandalising them and
obstructing them from discharging their duties without
fear or favour. When the court exercises this power, it
does not do so to vindicate the dignity and honour of the
individual judge who is personally attacked or
scandalised, but to uphold the majesty of the law and of
the administration of justice. The foundation of the
judiciary is the trust and the confidence of the people in
its ability to deliver fearless and impartial justice. When
the foundation itself is shaken by acts which tend to
create disaffection and disrespect for the authority of the
court by creating distrust in its working, the edifice of the
judicial system gets eroded.”
12.   The purpose of contempt jurisdiction is to uphold the majesty and
dignity of the courts of law, since the respect and authority commanded by
the courts of law are the greatest guarantee to an ordinary citizen and the
democratic fabric of society will suffer if respect for the judiciary is
Digitally Signed        CONT.CAS(C) 92/2022                                              Page 9 of 10
undermined. For the acts done by the Respondent No.1/Contemnor, he
deserves no mercy from this Court. A strong message has to be sent to the
society that the orders of the Court cannot be flouted by using strong arm
tactics.
13.    Keeping in view the contumacious conduct of the Respondent
No.1/Contemnor (Shyam Sunder Tyagi), this Court sentences the
Respondent No.1/Contemnor (Shyam Sunder Tyagi), who is present in
Court today, to undergo 45 days of simple imprisonment along with a fine of
14.    The Respondent No.1/Contemnor (Shyam Sunder Tyagi) is directed
to be taken in custody forthwith.
15.    Registry is directed to prepare the necessary warrants forthwith.
16.    With these observations, the petition is disposed, of along with all the
pending application(s), if any.
