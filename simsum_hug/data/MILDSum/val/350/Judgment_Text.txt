This Revision Petition has been filed under Section 397 and
401 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (hereinafter referred to as
`Cr.P.C' for short) and the revision petitioner is the respondent in
M.C.No.252/2016         on    the   files  of  the    Family    Court,
Thiruvananthapuram.        The respondents herein are the original
petitioners in the above M.C.
2.    Heard the learned counsel for the revision petitioner as
well as the learned counsel appearing for the respondents.
3.    The questions emanate in this revision petitioner are:
(i)   Whether an unmarried daughter can claim allowance of
R.P.F.C.No.503 of 2022               3
maintenance under Section 125(1) of Cr.P.C even after attaining
majority? If so, on what contingency?
(ii) Is there any other enabling provision of law for a Hindu
unmarried daughter to claim maintenance dehors the provision
under Section 125 of Cr.P.C?
4.    The 1st respondent herein is the wife of the revision
petitioner and the 2nd respondent is the daughter of the revision
petitioner, aged 17 years during 2016.         The respondents had
approached the Family Court with prayer to grant allowance of
maintenance on the submission that they did not have means of
maintenance. Further, it was contended that the revision petitioner,
who had been conducting “He `N' She Dress Makers”, had been
earning Rs.40,000/- per day and, therefore, he could pay
maintenance to the tune of Rs.50,000/- to the 1st respondent and
Rs.25,000/- to the 2nd respondent.
5.    The revision petitioner filed objection and resisted the
contention. According to him, he had been working in a tailoring
R.P.F.C.No.503 of 2022               4
shop on a daily wage basis and had been getting Rs.500/- as daily
wage.     He had denied the business and also denied the illicit
relationship alleged against him.
6.    The Family Court ventured the matter.            The 1st
respondent examined as PW1 and the revision petitioner got
examined as CPW1. Exts.B1 to B3 were marked on the side of the
revision petitioner.
7.    The Family Court, on the basis of the evidence, granted
Rs.10,000/- and Rs.8,000/- as maintenance to the 1st and 2nd
respondents respectively per month from the date of filing of the
8.    The learned counsel for the revision petitioner zealously
argued that the Family Court failed to consider the income of the
revision petitioner. Admittedly the revision petitioner was getting
Rs.500/- per day while working in the tailoring shop as a manager,
and, therefore, the maintenance granted to the respondents is on
higher side and the same requires interference. It is pointed out
R.P.F.C.No.503 of 2022                    5
further that the 2nd respondent herein was aged 17 years during
2016 and during 2017, she became major. Therefore, she could not
claim maintenance under Section 125 of Cr.P.C. He also pointed
out that in order to sustain claim of maintenance at the instance of
an unmarried daughter, belongs to Hindu community, she should
file a petition under Section 20 of the Hindu Adoptions and
Maintenance Act, 1956, and in a petition filed under Section 125 of
Cr.P.C an unmarried daughter, who attained majority, could not
claim maintenance after attaining majority. In this connection, the
learned counsel for the revision petitioner placed a decision of the
Apex Court reported in [2020 (5) KHC 235 : AIR 2020 SC 4355 :
2020 (6) KLT 341 : 2020 KLJ 814], Abhilasha v. Parkash & Ors.
In the said decision the Apex Court considered the questions and
“The moot question that arose for consideration in this
appeal was whether a daughter, who although had attained
majority and is still unmarried, is entitled to claim maintenance
from her father in proceedings under S.125 CrPC although she
R.P.F.C.No.503 of 2022                     6
is   not     suffering   from    any    physical    or   mental
abnormality/injury?    What are the rights of an unmarried
daughter under Section 20 of the Hindu Adoptions and
9.     While answering the said queries, the Apex Court held
“The right of unmarried daughter under S.20 to claim
maintenance from her father when she is unable to maintain
herself is absolute and the right given to unmarried daughter
under S.20 is right granted under personal law, which can very
well be enforced by her against her father. The judgment of this
Court in Jagdish Jugtawat (supra) laid down that S.20(3) of the
Act,1956 recognised the right of a minor girl to claim
maintenance after she attains majority till her marriage from her
father. Unmarried daughter is clearly entitled for maintenance
from her father till she is married even though she has become
major, which is a statutory right recognised by S.20(3) and can be
enforced by unmarried daughter in accordance with law. The
purpose and object of S.125 Cr.P.C as noted above is to provide
immediate relief to applicant in a summary proceedings, whereas
right under S.20 read with S.3(b) of Act, 1956 contains larger
right, which needs determination by a Civil Court, hence for the
larger claims as enshrined under S.20, the proceedings need to be
initiated under S.20 of the Act and the Legislature never
R.P.F.C.No.503 of 2022                    7
contemplated to burden the Magistrate while exercising
jurisdiction under S.125 Cr.P.C to determine the claims
contemplated by Act, 1956. We, thus, accept the submission of
the learned counsel for the appellant that as a proposition of law,
an unmarried Hindu daughter can claim maintenance from her
father till she is married relying on S.20(3) of the Act, 1956,
provided she pleads and proves that she is unable to maintain
herself, for enforcement of which right her application/suit has to
be under S.20 of Act, 1956.”
“The Act, 1956 was enacted to amend and codify the law
relating to adoptions and maintenance among Hindus. A bare
perusal of S.125(1) Cr.P.C. as well as S.20 of Act, 1956
indicates that whereas S.125 Cr.P.C limits the claim of
maintenance of a child until he or she attains majority. By
virtue of S.125(1) (c), an unmarried daughter even though she
has attained majority is entitled for maintenance, where such
unmarried daughter is by reason of any physical or mental
abnormality or injury is unable to maintain itself.          The
Scheme under S.125(1) Cr.P.C, thus, contemplate that claim of
maintenance by a daughter, who has attained majority is
admissible only when by reason of any physical or mental
abnormality or injury, she is unable to maintain herself.”
11. It is submitted by the learned counsel for the revision
R.P.F.C.No.503 of 2022                8
petitioner further that in this particular case, no evidence let in to
substantiate that the 2nd respondent suffers from any physical or
mental abnormality or injury and she could not maintain herself.
12. Per contra, it is submitted by the learned counsel for the
respondents that an unmarried daughter, who attained majority, also
would get maintenance if she cannot maintain herself.
13. While answering the queries (i) and (ii),        the legal
position emerges is that by virtue of Section 125 (1) of Cr.P.C, an
unmarried daughter, who attained majority, could not claim
maintenance in the ordinary circumstance, viz. merely on the
ground that she does not have means for her sustenance. At the
same time, even though the unmarried daughter, who attained
majority, is entitled for maintenance, where such unmarried
daughter is by reason of any physical or mental abnormality or
injury is unable to maintain herself, for which, pleadings and
evidence in this regard are mandatory.          Otherwise, the legal
proposition is that an unmarried Hindu daughter can claim
R.P.F.C.No.503 of 2022                9
maintenance from her father till she is married resorting to S.20(3)
of Hindu Adoptions and Maintenance Act, 1956, provided, she
pleads and proves that she is unable to maintain herself, for
enforcement of which right her application/suit has to be under
S.20 of Act, 1956. On evaluation of the evidence available in this
matter, no evidence let in to show that the 2nd respondent has any
physical or mental abnormality, or she has any injury so that she
could not maintain herself and, therefore, grant of maintenance to
the 2nd respondent, (who is now aged above 18 years) from the date
of attaining majority, is found to be erroneous and thereby the order
impugned stands set aside to that extent, limiting entitlement of
maintenance by the 2nd respondent till the date she attained
14. Coming to the other challenge, the specific case put up
by the 1st respondent herein before the trial court was that she did
not have any means of maintenance. In fact, the revision petitioner
did not raise any contention asserting that the 1st respondent was
R.P.F.C.No.503 of 2022              10
capable of maintaining herself and no evidence also adduced in this
behalf. The Family Court disbelieved the version of CPW1 to the
effect that he had been working as a labourer and getting Rs.500/-
per day as income. The Family Court observed that during cross
examination CPW1 had stated that he had been working as
Manager of “He `N' She Dress Makers”' and there are 52
employees working in that firm.       Therefore, the Family Court
found contradiction in his versions about his job and accordingly
found that the revision petitioner had sufficient means to pay
Rs.10,000/- to the 1st respondent and Rs.8,000/- to the 2 nd
15. Since the claim of maintenance to the 2 nd respondent
stands limited till her date of attaining majority, the question of
maintenance granted to the 2nd respondent at Rs.8,000/- is found
reasonable and the same is confirmed.         Now the remaining
question is whether grant of Rs.10,000/- as maintenance to the 1 st
respondent needs interference in any manner.
R.P.F.C.No.503 of 2022             11
16. Going by the evidence of PW1, she would say that the
revision petitioner had been getting Rs.40,000/- per day.       But
CPW1 confined his income to Rs.500/- per day after admitting that
he had been working as Manager of “He `N' She Dress Makers”,
where admittedly 52 employees w`1`1ere working. Therefore, the
income stated by CPW1 was found not believable by the Family
Court and this Court also could not believe the same to hold in the
contrary to reduce the maintenance granted to the 1 st respondent by
the Family Court. Therefore, it has to be held that the Family
Court rightly granted Rs.10,000/- as the allowance of monthly
maintenance to the 1st respondent and the same does not require
any interference.
17. In view of the above, the order impugned stands
modified confining Rs.8,000/- (Rupees Eight thousand only) per
month as maintenance to the 2nd respondent till the date of her
attaining majority, while confirming grant of maintenance @
Rs.10,000/- per month to the 1st respondent, as per the impugned
R.P.F.C.No.503 of 2022               12
This Revision Petition stands allowed in part as above.
