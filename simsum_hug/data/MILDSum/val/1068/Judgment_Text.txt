Learned AGP Smt. R.P. Gour waives service for respondent no.1 and
learned advocate Mr. Subhash Chillarge waives service for respondent
nos.2 and 3.         At the joint request of the parties, the matter is heard
finally at the stage of admission.
2.               The petitioner challenges the judgment and order dated
05.11.2019 passed by the Maharashtra Administrative Tribunal,
Bench at Aurangabad in Original Application No.69 of 2018. In his
Original Application, the petitioner had challenged the order dated
24.01.2018 directing recovery of amount of Rs.2,58,711/- from his
retirement benefits. By the impugned judgment, the Tribunal has
dismissed the Original Application.
3.               The petitioner was appointed as Technical Assistant in
the office of respondent no.3 on 16.02.1982, which post was
abolished and the petitioner came to be absorbed on the post of Civil
Engineering Assistant w.e.f. 01.01.1989. He had passed Sub Overseer
examination on 18.05.1985 and by order dated 03.08.2004, he was
promoted on the post of Sub Overseer by granting deemed date of
promotion as on 18.05.1985. On account of completion of 12 years
of service from the date of initial appointment of 16.02.1982, he was
granted financial upgradation under the Time Bound Promotion
scheme w.e.f. 01.10.1994. On completion of 24 years of service, he
was granted benefit of second Time Bound Promotion with effect
from 01.10.2006.            Later, he was promoted to the post of Junior
Engineer, Class-II, Non Gazetted post by order dated 02.07.2007. On
attaining the age of superannuation, he retired from service on
31.08.2017.         Upon submitting his pension papers, the Accountant
General, Mumbai formed an opinion that the petitioner’s services
from the date of initial appointment of 16.02.1982 could not be
counted for Time Bound Promotion and the same were required to be
counted from the date of his absorption as Civil Engineering Assistant
w.e.f. 01.01.1989. Accordingly, refixation of petitioner’s pay was done
and an amount of Rs.2,58,711/- was directed to be recovered.
4.               In his original application, the petitioner did not dispute
the action of the respondents in re-fixing his pay. What was
challenged was only the recovery effected as a consequence of
re-fixation. The Tribunal proceeded to dismiss the original application
on the ground that since the petitioner was functioning on Class-II
post of Junior Engineer, he is not entitled to protection against
recovery by applying ratio of the Judgment of the Apex Court in
State of Punjab & Ors. Vs. Rafiq Masih (white Washer) and Others,
5.               Mr. Sugdare, learned advocate appearing for the
petitioner would submit that even though the petitioner was
promoted on the post of Junior Engineer on 02.07.2007, the recovery
is in respect of the period when he was working on Class-III post. He
would submit that the recovery in respect of such a long period could
not have been effected after retirement of the petitioner. He relied
upon judgment of the Apex Court in The State of Maharashtra and
another Vs. Madhukar Antu Patil and another, Civil Appeal No.1985
of 2022 decided on 21.03.2022.
6.                Per contra, Mr. Chillarge, learned advocate appearing for
respondent nos.2 and 3 opposes the petition and would submit that
the petitioner was erroneously granted the benefit of Time Bound
Promotion scheme. He would submit that in addition to Time Bound
Promotions, the petitioner was also granted regular promotion on the
post of Junior Engineer. He would therefore submit that the
respondents have rightly withdrawn the erroneous benefit of Time
Bound Promotion granted to the petitioner and have accordingly
refixed his pay. He would further submit that recovery is a natural
consequence of refixation of pay and the petitioner cannot be
permitted to retain the amount erroneously granted to him.                        He
would submit that being a Class-II Officer, the petitioner is not
entitled to the benefit of the judgment of the Apex Court in Rafiq
7.               The learned AGP appearing for respondent no.1 has
supported the order passed by the Tribunal and has prayed for
dismissal of the petition.
8.               The law regarding recovery of excess payment is now
well settled by the judgment of the Apex Court in Rafiq Masih
(supra).       After considering the entire jurisprudence regarding the
subject of recovery of excess payment, the Apex Court has
summarised the situations as under:
“12.        It is not possible to postulate all situations of
hardship, which would govern employees on the issue
of recovery, where payments have mistakenly been
made by the employer, in excess of their entitlement.
Be that as it may, based on the decisions referred to
herein above, we may, as a ready reference,
summarise the following few situations, wherein
recoveries by the employers, would be impermissible
(i) Recovery from employees belonging to Class-III
and Class-IV service (or Group 'C' and Group 'D'
service).
(ii) Recovery from retired employees, or employees
who are due to retire within one year, of the order of
recovery.
(iii) Recovery from employees, when the excess
payment has been made for a period in excess of five
years, before the order of recovery is issued.
(iv) Recovery in cases where an employee has
wrongfully been required to discharge duties of a
higher post, and has been paid accordingly, even
though he should have rightfully been required to
work against an inferior post.
(v) In any other case, where the Court arrives at the
conclusion, that recovery if made from the employee,
would be iniquitous or harsh or arbitrary to such an
extent, as would far outweigh the equitable balance of
the employer's right to recover.”
9.               Upon perusal of the principles laid down by the Apex
Court in Rafiq Masih (supra), it is clear that the five situations
summarized by the Court in para - 12 of the Judgment are not
exhaustive. The Apex Court itself has made it clear that it is not
possible to postulate all the situations of hardships, which would
govern employees on the issue of recovery, where payments have
mistakenly been made by the employer in excess of their entitlement.
Thus, it cannot be stated that only in five situations summarized by
the Apex Court, the recovery would be bad. It would always be open
to the Courts to extend the benefit of protection from recovery in an
appropriate case which is not covered by any of the five situations
summarized in Rafiq Masih (supra).
10.              Having considered the exposition of law laid down by
the Apex Court relating to recovery of excess payment in Rafiq Masih
(supra), we now proceed to consider applicability of the situations to
the present case.
11.              We have gone through the affidavit-in-reply filed on
behalf of respondent no.1 before the Tribunal. We find that the exact
reason for re-fixation of pay of the petitioner was not disclosed in the
affidavit-in-reply.         However, following averments were made in
para - 4 thereof.
“4.         I say that as to contents of para No.6 (a), as
submitted herein above, initial appointment of the
applicant was on daily wages and on completion of
five years, he was brought on CRTE. As submitted by
the applicant, his services are to be reckoned from
12.              Thus, from the averments made in para - 4 of the
affidavit-in-reply filed before the Tribunal, it appears that the
petitioner’s initial appointment w.e.f. 16.02.1982 was apparently on
daily wages, that too on work charged establishment. This fact can
be ascertained from para - 2 of the petition, wherein the petitioner
has averred as under:
“02.        The petitioner states that he belongs to Other
Backward Class (O.B.C.). He was appointed as
Technical Assistant in the Office of the Respondent
No.3 on 16-02-1982. He continuously worked on the
work charged establishment till he came to be
absorbed on the post Civil Engineering Assistant w.e.f.
01-01-1989. The petitioner passed Sub Overseer
Examination on dated 18-05-1985, therefore, he was
promoted on the post of Sub Overseer and he was
granted ‘deemed date’ as on 18-05-1985. The
petitioner rendered more than 12 years continuous
service from the date of his appointment on
16-02-1982. He was found eligible for promotion but
for the want of vacancy he was given benefit of Time
Bound Promotion from 01-10-1994 on the post of
Junior Engineer. Thereafter, he completed 24 years
satisfactory service on the post of Technical Assistant,
therefore, his case was considered for grand of 2 nd
benefit       (Second   Time     Bound        Promotion).
Accordingly, benefit was extended to him w.e.f.
13.              Thus, the petitioner came to be absorbed in regular
service only on 01.01.1989 as Civil Engineering Assistant. It appears
that for counting the service for grant of Time Bound Promotion, his
initial service on work charged establishment with effect from
16.02.1982 was counted and he was granted the first Time Bound
Promotion on 01.10.1994. This was clearly erroneous. The error was
continued while granting second Time Bound Promotion on
completion of 24 years of service w.e.f. 01.10.2006. It appears that
the respondents have corrected the dates of effecting Time Bound
Promotions by counting service of the petitioner from 01.01.1989.
Since the corrective action taken by the respondents was valid, the
petitioner chose not to challenge the same in his original application,
in which he made the following prayers:
“B.         By order or directions by this Tribunal the
impugned order dated 24-01-2018 in Office Order
No.13 of 2018 issued by the respondent no.3
regarding recovery of an amount of Rs.2,58,711
(Rupees Two Lacks fifty Eight Thousand Seven
Hundred Eleven) be quashed and set aside.
C.          By order or directions the respondent no.3 be
directed to pay the amount which is sought to be
recovered under office order no.13 of 2018 of
Rs.2,58,711/- to the applicant.”
14.              However, after the Tribunal criticized the petitioner for
not having challenged refixation of pay, the petitioner has sought to
challenge refixation of pay and has sought the relief of restoration of
Time Bound Promotions as on 01.10.1994 and 01.10.2006 in the
present petition. The prayers in the present petition are as under :
“A.         Writ Petition may pleased be allowed.
writ in like nature, impugned order No.13/2018 dated
24/01/2018 issued by the Respondent No.3 in respect

Thousand Eight Hundred Thirty Seven only) be
quashed and set aside.
writ in like nature the impugned letter dated 6 th
September, 2017 issued by the Accountant General,

directed to refix the pay of the petitioner by counting
his service from his initial date of appointment i.e.
16-02-1982, by restoring Time Bound Promotion as on
01-10-1994 and 01-10-2006 respectively.
F.          Pending hearing and final disposal of this W.P.
the Respondent No.3 may be directed to refund the
recovered amount of Rs.2,58,711/- (revised amount of
Rs.2,62,837/-) (in words Rs. Two Lakh Sixty
15.              We are afraid, in exercise of power of Superintendence
over the order passed by the Tribunal, we cannot permit the
petitioner to expand the scope of challenge in the present petition.
We, therefore, proceed to ignore prayer clause ‘E’ made in the present
petition.
16.              In Madhukar Antu Patil (supra) relied upon by
Mr. Sugdare, the fact situation was somewhat similar. In that case,
the respondent therein was initially appointed on 11.05.1982 as
Technical Assistant on work charged basis and came to be absorbed
as Civil Engineering Assistant in the year 1989. He was erroneously
granted Time Bound Promotions by considering the date of his initial
appointment as 1982 and after his retirement, the error was sought
to be corrected. The Apex Court has held in para nos.3.1, 4 and 5 as
“3.1        At the outset, it is required to be noted and it
is not in dispute that respondent no.1 was initially
appointed on 11.05.1982 as a Technical Assistant on
work charge basis. It is also not in dispute that
thereafter he was absorbed in the year 1989 on the
newly created post of Civil Engineering Assistant,
which carried a different pay scale. Therefore, when
the contesting respondent was absorbed in the year
1989 on the newly created post of Civil Engineering
Assistant which carried a different pay scale, he shall
be entitled to the first TBP on completion of twelve
years of service from the date of his absorption in the
post of Civil Engineering Assistant. The services
rendered by the contesting respondent as Technical
Assistant on work charge basis from 11.05.1982 could
not have been considered for the grant of benefit of
first TBP. If the contesting respondent would have
been absorbed on the same post of Technical Assistant
on which he was serving on work charge basis, the
position may have been different. The benefit of TBP
scheme shall be applicable when an employee has
worked for twelve years in the same post and in the
same pay scale.
4.          In the present case, as observed hereinabove,
his initial appointment in the year 1982 was in the
post of Technical Assistant on work charge basis,
which was altogether a different post than the newly
created post of Civil Engineering Assistant in which he
was absorbed in the year 1989, which carried a
different pay scale. Therefore, the department was
right in holding that the contesting respondent was
entitled to the first TBP on completion of twelve years
from the date of his absorption in the year 1989 in the
post of Civil Engineering Assistant. Therefore both, the
High Court as well as the Tribunal have erred in
observing that as the first TBP was granted on the
approval of the Government and the Finance
Department, subsequently the same cannot be
modified and/or withdrawn. Merely because the
benefit of the first TBP was granted after the approval
of the Department cannot be a ground to continue the
same, if ultimately it is found that the contesting
respondent was entitled to the first TBP on completion
of twelve years of service only from the year 1989.
Therefore both, the High Court as well as the Tribunal
have committed a grave error in quashing and setting
aside the revision of pay scale and the revision in
pension, which were on re-fixing the date of grant of
first TBP from the date of his absorption in the year
1989 as Civil Engineering Assistant.
5.          However, at the same time, as the grant of
first TBP considering his initial period of appointment
of 1982 was not due to any misrepresentation by the
contesting respondent and on the contrary, the same
was granted on the approval of the Government and
the Finance Department and since the downward
revision of the pay scale was after the retirement of
the respondent, we are of the opinion that there shall
not be any recovery on re-fixation of the pay scale.
However, the respondent shall be entitled to the
pension on the basis of the re-fixation of the pay scale
on grant of first TBP from the year 1989, i.e., from the
date of his absorption as Civil Engineering Assistant.”
17.              Thus, under similar circumstances, the Apex Court has
granted protection from recovery on re-fixation of pay scale in the
case of Madhukar Antu Patil (supra). Mr. Chillarge has sought to
distinguish the judgment in Madhukar Antu Patil (supra) by
contending that the respondent therein retired on the post of Civil
Engineering Assistant, which is a Class-III post, whereas the petitioner
in the instant petition retired on the post of Junior Engineer, which is
a Class-II Non-gazetted post. The question that therefore arises is,
whether we can extend the protection granted in the case of
Madhukar Antu Patil (supra) by following the judgment of the Apex
Court or whether we restrain ourselves from doing so only because
the petitioner does not fall in situation at serial no.(i) of the
Judgment in Rafiq Masih (supra) i.e. he is not Class-III or Class-IV
employee. This is a reason why we have attempted to summarize
situations expounded by the Apex Court in Rafiq Masih (supra) on
law relating to recovery of excess payment and have arrived at a
conclusion that in an appropriate and rare case, this Court would be
justified in extending the benefit of recovery even to Class-I or
Class-II Officers, if the situation so demands.
18.              The recovery in the instant case has been effected after
retirement of the petitioner. Nothing had prevented the respondents
from correcting the mistake in grant of Time Bound Promotions to
the petitioner during his service career. The refixation appears to
have been done w.e.f. 01.10.1994 as the corrective action involved
withdrawal of benefit of first Time Bound Promotion granted w.e.f.
01.10.1994. Thus, the corrective action is taken after a period of 23
long years and consequently, the recovery also appears to be in
respect of 23 long years. Also, most of the period of recovery was
when the petitioner was occupying Class-III post. Admittedly, there
was no misrepresentation on the post of the petitioner in securing the
excess payment. We have two very strong reasons in the present case
for arriving at a conclusion that the recovery would be arbitrary, viz.
unduly long period of 23 years of recovery and retirement of the
petitioner.      After weighing these two positive factors against the
negative factor of the petitioner retiring on Class-II Officer post, we
find that the former would outweigh the latter. Undeniably, the case
of the petitioner is similar to that of Madhukar Antu Patil (supra).
The only distinguishing factor is the petitioner retired on Class-II post
of Junior Engineer, whereas Madhukar Antu Patil (supra) retired on
Class-III post of Civil Engineering Assistant. We find that the Apex
Court in Madhukar Antu Patil (supra) without considering whether
he belonged to Class-II or Class-III post extended the protection of
recovery of excess payment. The protection is granted in the peculiar
facts and circumstances of the case. Since the two cases are similar,
we have no hesitation in following the judgment and applying the
ratio of the judgment in Madhukar Antu Patil (supra) to the present
case.
19.              We are also not in agreement with the finding recorded
by the Tribunal that the petitioner ought to have challenged the order
of refixation of pay. It was always open to the petitioner to question
only the recovery and not his refixation. In fact, we find that the
petitioner has rightly not challenged refixation of his pay and he was
still entitled to challenge recovery of excess payment after his
retirement.
20.              Before parting, we would clarify that applicability of
judgment of Rafiq Masih (supra) to the present case is on account of
peculiar facts of this case and the same shall not be construed to
mean that Class-I or Class-II Officer would be entitled to protection
from recovery as per Rafiq Masih (supra).
21.              Consequently, we allow the present petition by quashing
and setting aside the impugned judgment and order of the Tribunal.
The order dated 24.01.2018 effecting recovery of Rs.2,58,711/- from
the pensionary benefits of the petitioner is also set aside. The
respondents are directed to refund the recovered amount to the
petitioner along with the interest thereon at the rate of 6% per
annum within a period of four weeks from the date of receipt of this
order.
22.              Writ Petition is accordingly allowed. Rule is made
absolute.
