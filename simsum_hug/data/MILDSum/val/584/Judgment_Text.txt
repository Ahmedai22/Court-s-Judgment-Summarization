This is an appeal filed by the assessee against the order of the Income
Tax Appellate Tribunal dated 31.03.2009 in I.T.A.No.1588/Mds/2007.
2.The appellant is engaged in the business of manufacture and sale of
V & Fan Belts, Oil Seals etc. For the assessment year 2004-2005, they filed
its return on 01.11.2004 admitting a total income of Rs.14,02,65,870/-,
which was subsequently, revised by them on 20.09.2005, admitting the
income at Rs.13,93,08,090/-. Upon scrutiny of the same, the respondent
issued notice under section 143(2) of the Income Tax Act, 1961 (in short,
“the Act”) and thereafter, completed the assessment under section 143(3) on
20.12.2006 determining the total income at Rs.14,67,27,610/- which
excludes long term capital gains. While doing so, the assessing officer
among others, restricted the claim of deduction under section 80HHC by
excluding 90% of the royalty receipts from the profits of the business under
clause (baa) to explanation to section 80HHC(4). Challenging the order of
assessment passed by the assessing officer, the appellant preferred an appeal
before the Commissioner of Income Tax (Appeals)-I, Madurai, who, by
order dated 15.03.2007, partly allowed the appeal filed by the appellant.
Aggrieved over the same, the Revenue went on appeal before the ITAT. By
order dated 31.03.2009, the Tribunal set aside the order of the CIT(A) and
directed the assessing officer to exclude the receipt of royalty from business
profits for the purpose of deduction under section 80HHC of the Act.
Therefore, the appellant is before this court with this tax case appeal.
3.The learned counsel for the appellant contended that the appellant
entered into a MOU with its 100% subsidiary company; the subsidiary
company manufactures the goods as per the specifications given by the
appellant and the appellant has also provided know-how, secret formula
manufacturing process and methods to ensure the same quality of
manufactured goods; for providing these services, the subsidiary company
paid royalty and hence, the royalty receipts are directly related to the goods
exported by the appellant and the same cannot be excluded from the profits
of the business. Without considering the said aspect in a proper perspective,
the assessing officer excluded 90% of the royalty receipts from the profits of
the business. Though the CIT(A) rightly set aside the order of assessment,
the Tribunal erred in directing the assessing officer to exclude the receipt of
royalty from business profits for the purpose of deduction under section
80HHC of the Act. Therefore, the learned counsel sought to allow this
appeal by setting aside the order of the Tribunal.
4.Repudiating the claim so made on the side of the appellant, the
learned senior standing counsel appearing for the respondent submitted that
the appellant/assessee cannot improve their case, when the issue involved
herein is covered by a decision of this Court in Commissioner of Income
Tax v. Shiva Distilleries Ltd., [(2007) 293 ITR 108], wherein, it was
categorically held that “guarantee commission as well as royalty viz., a
payment for using a right, have to be excluded from the business profit for
the purpose of calculation of deduction under section 80HHC of the Act”.
Thus, according to the learned counsel, there cannot be any reason for
deviating such a view, which has already attained finality.
5.Heard both sides and perused the materials available on record.
6.By order dated 20.06.2012, this Tax Case Appeal was admitted on
the following substantial questions of law:
“1. Whether on the facts and in the circumstances of the
case, the Tribunal was right in holding that the royalty income
received for providing know-how, secret formula manufacturing
process and methods in respect of goods manufactured by the
subsidiary and exported by the assessee is not eligible for
deduction under Section 80HHC of the Income Tax Act?
2. Whether on the facts and in the circumstances of the
case, the Tribunal was right in holding that the royalty receipts
should be excluded from the profits of the business for the purpose
of computation of deduction under Section 80HHC of the Income
7.Before the assessing officer, the appellant claimed that the sale of
raw materials, processed waste and scrap, sale of spares, etc. form part of
business activities and hence, it should be included in the total turnover.
Further, the royalty received by them for the services provided to the
subsidiary company, is related to export activity and therefore, the same
cannot be taken into account for 90% exclusion from the business profits,
while computing deduction under section 80HHC. However, the assessing
officer rejected the claim of the appellant, after having held that royalty
income claimed by them is not arising out of any business activity related to
export and it is incidental in nature and hence, 90% of the royalty income
was reduced from the profit of the business for computation of deduction
under section 80HHC.
8.In the appeal filed by the appellant, the CIT(A) allowed the claim of
the appellant, relating to royalty income, after following the earlier order of
the Tribunal dated 31.07.2006 in ITA.No.2669/Mds/04 in respect of the
appellant's own case for the assessment year 2000-01. However, the
Tribunal set aside the same and directed the assessing officer to exclude the
receipt of royalty from business profits for the purpose of deduction under
section 80HHC of the Act, based on the decision of this court in CIT v.
9.In the aforesaid decision in Shiva Distilleries Ltd, this court had
referred to the earlier order in CIT v. Madras Motors Ltd / M.M.Forgings
Ltd [(2002) 257 ITR 60], in which, it was held that “the turnover from the
business of sale of motorcycles, motorcycle spare parts and television sets
could not be included in the total turnover of the assessee for the purpose
of the computation of deduction under section 80HHC of the Act as the
total turnover in section 80HHC is only the turnover relating to export
business of the assessee and not the turnover relating to other business of
the assessee”. In the light of the said order, this court held that the scrap
and waste materials, which would not be relatable to export business of the
assessee, have to be excluded from business profit for the purpose of
calculation of deduction under section 80HHC of the Act.
10.Further, in the same decision in Shiva Distilleries Ltd case, with
regard to includibility of royalty as well as the guarantee commission for the
purpose of calculation of deduction under section 80HHC of the Act, this
court had referred to two decisions (i)CIT v. Bangalore Clothing Co.
[(2003) 260 ITR 371], wherein, it was held by the Bombay High Court that
“the Explanation (baa) to section 80HHC of the Income Tax Act, 1961,
was inserted by the Finance (No.2) Act, 1991, with effect from April 1,
1992 and under that Explanation, “profits of the business”, for the
purposes of section 80HHC does not include receipts which do not have
an element of turnover like rent, commission, interest etc”; and (ii)CIT v.
Sundaram Clayton Ltd [(2006) 281 ITR 425], in which, it was held by this
court that “the charges of miscellaneous income and commission do not
form part of the turnover for the purpose of calculation of deduction
under section 80HHC of the Act”. Following the said two decisions, it was
categorically held that “guarantee commission as well as royalty viz., a
payment for using a right, have to be excluded from the business profit for
the purpose of calculation of deduction under section 80HHC of the Act”.
11.Applying the ratio laid down in the aforesaid decision viz., Shiva
Distilleries Ltd's case, which is squarely applicable to the facts of the
present case, wherein, there is no concrete material produced by the
appellant / assessee to prove that the royalty income received from the
subsidiary company, are related to export business, this court is of the view
that the Tribunal has rightly directed the assessing officer to exclude the
royalty income from the business profits for the purpose of calculation of
deduction under section 80HHC of the Act, which warrants no interference.
12.In such view of the matter, the substantial questions of law raised
herein are answered against the appellant. Accordingly, the tax case appeal
stands dismissed. No costs.
