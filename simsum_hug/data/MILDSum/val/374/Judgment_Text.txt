… For the applicants/petitioners
… For the alleged contemnors/
respondents no.4 and 5
The contempt application arises out of an order
dated 13th September, 2021 passed in WPA 7595 of
2021. The operative portion of the said order is as
“After hearing the parties and considering
the materials on record, I find that justice will
be sub-served if the respondent nos.1, 2 and 3
are directed to decide on the issue as referred to
them by the respondent no.5 by his letter dated
6th August, 2019 within a time-frame by a
reasoned order after considering all aspects of
the matter as reflected in the letter dated 6th
August, 2019 issued by the respondent no.5.
The respondent nos.1, 2 and 3, if necessary,
may    call for  further  documents     from   the
respondent     nos.4,  5   and    6 for  effective
adjudication of the issue.
The entire exercise shall be completed by
the Competent Authority within a period of four
months from the date of communication of this
order upon payment of deficit court fees.     The
respondent nos.1, 2 and 3 immediately upon
the decision, vide a reasoned is taken in the
matter, shall communicate the same to the
respondent no.5 as also to the petitioners.
Parties shall act on a server copy of the
order without being insisting upon production of
a certified copy thereof.”

contempt application was filed on 23rd February,
2022. The contempt application was directed to be
served by an order dated 1st April, 2022 making the
same returnable on 22nd April, 2022.
The matter was adjourned on 22nd April, 2022 as
the alleged contemnors/respondents no.1, 2 and 3
remained unrepresented despite service to afford the
said   alleged   contemnors/respondents      a  further
opportunity to represent before this Court. A direction
was also given on 22nd April, 2022 to serve a fresh
notice to the alleged contemnors/respondents no.1, 2
and 3. The applicants/petitioners have served a notice
dated     22nd    April,   2022       to    the    alleged
contemnors/respondents no.1, 2 and 3 which has
been duly received on 25th April, 2022 and 26th April,
2022. An affidavit of service filed in this regard by the
applicants/petitioners is taken on record. The alleged
contemnors/respondents       no.1,   2   and    3 remain
unrepresented despite service even today. The version
of the alleged contemnors/respondents no.1, 2 and 3
is not available to the Court despite the contempt
petition being adjourned on 22nd April, 2022.
