Heard learned counsel for the parties at length.
Leave granted.
The short question, on which the present appeal
has been preferred, is that the High Court, vide its
impugned   Judgment    dated   25.08.2017,  reduced   the
compensation payable to the appellant(s) – claimants
whose son had suffered fatal injuries and passed away
on account of a motorcycle accident.
The Tribunal, in the first instance, had rejected
the claim that the deceased was earning ₹ 10,000/-
per month and had arrived at the figure of ₹ 3,683/-
per month, on the basis of which, compensation was
directed,    after    holding    that   the   appropriate
multiplier was 18.
Aggrieved, the Insurer approached the High Court,
which   in    its   impugned    Judgment,   reduced   the
Digitally signed by
Reason:                 multiplier   to   9 having   regarding  the  age   of the
surviving mother, who was the deceased’s dependent.
This has been taken exception to by the appellants.
In addition, it has been urged that the High Court
overlooked   the   five-Judge     Bench    decision   of   this
Court in National Insurance Company Ltd. Vs. Pranay
Sethi & Ors. reported in (2017) 16 SCC 680, in terms
of  which,    the   claimants     were    also   entitled    to
enhanced   future    prospects     while     calculating    the
quantum of compensation.
Having   heard    learned  counsel     for   the  parties,
this Court is of the opinion that on the issue of
multiplier,    the   approach    of   the    High   Court   was
incorrect; it cannot be sustained, having regard to
the three-Judge Bench decision of this Court in M/s
Mandala Yadagari Gour & Ors. in (2019) 5 SCC 554,
wherein it was observed as under :-
“16.     In view of the Judgment delivered
today in Civil Appeal No. 6600 of 2015
titled     as    “Royal     Sundaram      Alliance
Goud, opining that it is the age of the
deceased and not such of the dependents
in case of the death of a bachelor which
is to be the basis for the multiplier,
this    appeal    is   also      liable    to   be
dismissed as this is the only plea urged.
Pending     application,      if    any,    stands
disposed of.
17.     In view of the Judgment delivered
today in Civil Appeal No. 6600 of 2015
titled   as   Royal  Sundaram   Alliance   Co.
Ltd.    V.   Mandala   Yadagari    Goud,   the
multiplier in the present case will be
16, and not as per the impugned order,
based on the age of the deceased……….
As a consequence, the impugned order of the High
Court to the extent it reduced the multiplier, is
hereby set aside.        The order of the Tribunal is,
consequently, restored on this score.
On the second aspect, the High Court again fell
into an error in denying enhancement of compensation
on  account   of   future  prospects.     The  Judgment  is
Pranay Sethi (Supra) is clear on this aspect; since
the appellant was working in the informal sector, the
appropriate standard would be 40% of the compensation
determined.    Consequently, it is hereby directed that
the   additional    compensation  on   account   of  future
prospects would be worked at 40% of the basic amount
i.e. ₹ 4,107/- per month.
In view of the forgoing discussion, the impugned
order passed by the High Court is set aside.            The
order of the Tribunal is hereby restored as far as
the multiplier is concerned; it shall be 18.         So far
as the question of additional quantum on account of
future prospects      is concerned, the appellant shall
be entitled to 40% on that score, on the basic amount
of ₹ 4,107/-     per month.    The other directions of
payment of interest etc. are left undisturbed and in
accordance  with   the order   of  the  Tribunal.    The
appeals are allowed in terms thereof.
There shall be no order as to costs.
