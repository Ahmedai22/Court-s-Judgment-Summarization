The Madras High Court on Thursday granted conditional bail to Hindu Munnani office bearer and stunt master Kanal Kannan for his remarks seeking to demolish the statur of Periyar outside Srirangam temple.
 Justice GK Ilanthiraiyan granted him bail on condition that he shall file an affidavit before the Egmore Court guaranteeing that he will not make any such statements in the future. He has also been directed to appear before the police two times for a period of four weeks. 
 The petitioner, who was attending a meeting organised by Hindu Munnani had called for demolition of a statue of Periyar situated outside Sri Rangam Ranganathan temple. He had stated that the words on the statue of an atheist like Periyar would hurt the religious sentiments of people belonging to the Hindu Community.
 He contended that what he said was in fact true and that it was not against any law of the country. He further stated that the words on the statue were in fact violative of Sections 153, 505(1X6), 505 (2) of the IPC. 
 Challenging the manner in which the arrest was made, Mr. Kannan contended that the procedure under S. 41 CrPC was not followed. These factors were however not considered by the courts below while dismissing the bail application.
 The court while granting bail, however, criticised the recent trend of making such remarks. The court stated that it had become a fashion to make such comments.
