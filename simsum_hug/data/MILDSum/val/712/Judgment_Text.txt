A charge sheet is filed alleging that accused No.1 gave
birth to twin babies on 14.9.2018.     Accused No.3, who was
married and issue less through accused No.4, intended to take
the daughter of accused No.1 on adoption. Accused Nos.1 and
2 agreed for giving adoption to accused No.3 on 14.9.2018
when accused No.1 came to the hospital for delivery, the
accused No.1 had asked accused No.3 to come to the hospital.
Accused No.1 delivered twin babies and one of the daughters
had breathing problem and the said daughter was taken by
CRL.P No. 100659 of 2021
accused No.3 by registering the name of the mother as Jareena
Begum and thereafter took the daughter of accused Nos.1 and
2 on adoption by executing a deed on Rs.20/- stamp paper.
The    learned    Magistrate  took   cognizance  of  the   offence
punishable under Section 80 of Juvenile Justice (Care and
Protection of Children) Act, 2015 (for short `Act’) and issued
summons to the petitioners.       Taking exception to the same,
this petition is filed.
2.    The learned counsel for the petitioners submits that
the child which is alleged to have been taken by adoption by
accused No.3 is not an orphan, abandoned or surrendered child
so as to constitute the commission of offence punishable under
Section 80 of the Act. Hence he submits that the charge sheet
filed against the petitioners – accused is without any substance.
3.    On     the other   hand,  the  learned   High   Court
Government Pleader submits that accused No.3 having taken
adoption of the child without following the provisions or
procedure as provided under the Act have committed the
offence punishable under Section 80 of the Act.
CRL.P No. 100659 of 2021
4.     I have considered the submissions of the learned
counsel for the parties.
5.     The allegation is that accused No.3 has taken
adoption of the daughter who was born to accused Nos.1 and 2
without following the provisions or procedure prescribed under
the Act thus constituting the offence punishable under Section
80 of the Act.      A person is stated to have committed an
offence, if he/she takes a child on adoption who is an orphan,
abandoned      or  surrendered      child   without  following  the
provisions or procedures as provided under the Act.          In the
present case, the allegation is that accused No.3 has taken a
child in adoption born to accused Nos.1 and 2 who is not an
abandoned child or orphan or surrendered child as defined
under Sections 2(1), 2(42) and 2(60) of the Act. In the absence
of any declaration that the child is deserted by his biological or
adoptive parents or guardians, the filing of the charge sheet is
also without any substance. Accordingly, I pass the following:
i)     Criminal petition is allowed.
ii)   The impugned proceedings in CC No.1016/2019
pending on the file of the Principal Civil Judge and JMFC Court,
Gangavathi, is hereby quashed.
