Sessions Case No.96/96 acquitting the respondent –
original accused from the offence punishable under sections
489(a), 489(b) and 489(c)of Indian Penal Code.
2.     The case of the prosecution in nutshell is as under:-
On 22/3/1995 owner of Prabhat Saw Mill named
Laxmidas Patel visited the Bank for depositing Rs.25,000/-
in Bank of Baroda Bank, Palanpur. As such he had placed
the notes of denomination of Rs.100 and Rs.50 before the
cashier and when the cashier was counting, some doubt
was created regarding 20 notes of Rs.100 i.e. total
Rs.2000/-. As such, the Manager was informed accordingly
and upon checking the notes, it was found to be counterfeit
and as a result, the notes were seized and complaint was
filed by the Senior Manager of Bank of Baroda, Palanpur in
Initially    investigation    was     carried    out      by       Head
Constable Rajabhai Virabhai. The notes were sent to
Government Press, Devas for checking. Thereafter, the
investigating officer investigated regarding involvement of
the accused and           as the     accused was not found, “A”
Sumary was filed by the then investigating officer, Palanpur
Thereafter, on 9/5/1996 upon Fax massage received
through D.S.P. Office, as an accused of counterfeit notes
was arrested in Bhuj Police Station, on the basis of the
Transfer         Warrant,   present       respondent        accused            was
arrested, investigation was carried out,                 and statements
were recorded and as Certificate from the Government
Press, Devas was received stating the 20 notes being
counterfeit notes, chargesheet was filed against the present
respondent accused.
Upon committal of the case to the Sessions Court,
learned Sessions Judge framed charge at Exh.4 against the
respondent          accused  for    the       aforesaid    offences.           The
respondent accused pleaded not guilty and claimed to be
In order to bring home charge, the prosecution has
examined 7 witnesses and also produced 7 documentary
evidences before the learned trial Court, more particularly
described in para 4 of the impugned judgment and order.
3. On conclusion of evidence on the part of the prosecution,
the trial Court put various incriminating circumstances
appearing in the evidence to the respondent accused so as
to obtain explanation/answer as provided u/s. 313 of the
Code of Criminal Procedure. In the further statement, the
respondent accused denied all incriminating circumstances
appearing against him as false and further stated that he is
innocent and false case has been filed against him.
4. We have heard learned APP Ms. Shah for the appellant –
State      and      have minutely    examined   the     record          and
proceedings provided to us during the course of hearing.
Learned APP has submitted that the prosecution case is
supported by deposition of the investigating officer and
P.S.I. Nathekhan Muradkhan PW No.6 and P.I. Balvant
Mulji PW No.7, who have carried the investigation and
received the information of counterfeit notes in Bhuj and the
counterfeit notes found in this case are from the same serial
numbers as being the Fax message by the D.S.P. Office.
Except this, no other discriminating evidence has been
placed on record.
5.     Per contra, learned advocate Mr. E.E. Saiyed appearing
for respondent – original accused           has submitted that
nothing incriminating is coming out from the evidence of the
prosecution so as to connect the respondent accused with
the crime in question.
6.     Heard the leaned advocates for the respective parties
at length and perused the impugned judgement and order of
acquittal passed by the trial court as well as the entire
record and proceedings.
7.     Before adverting to the facts of the case, it would be
worthwhile to refer to the scope in Acquittal Appeals. It is
well settled by is catena of decisions that an appellate Court
has full Power to review, re-appreciate and consider the
Evidence upon which the order of Acquittal is founded.
However, the Appellate Court must bear in mind that in
case of Acquittal, there is prejudice in favour of the
Accused, firstly, the presumption of innocence is available
to him under the Fundamental Principle of Criminal
Jurisprudence that every person shall be presumed to be
innocent unless he is proved guilty by a competent Court of
Law. Secondly, the Accused having secured his Acquittal,
the presumption of his innocence is further reaffirmed and
strengthened by the trial Court.
8.    We have carefully gone through the entire evidence of
main witness PW No.1 – Laxmidas Patel who is the person
who had come for depositing the amount in the Bank who is
the owner from of Prabhat sow mill. It reveals from the
evidence that 20 counterfeit notes were seized when he was
depositing the amount but he was unknown to the fact as
to how the notes had travelled to him. It is also admitted
that nothing comes out from the evidence of PW No.1 as to
involvement of the present respondent accused. It also
comes out from the evidence of the PW No.1 that the notes
were received by him during the transaction of his business
but it has not come out from his evidence that the present
accused had handed over these notes in          transaction of
some business with him.
9.    So far as recovery of counterfeit notes is concerned,
Panchnama is made out, counterfeit notes are seized, which
cannot be denied but to connect the accused with the
counterfeit notes, no evidence has been adduced by the
prosecution. Mr.Mava Mula is the person who was informed
by the cashier regarding counterfeit notes and the Bank
Manager filed the complaint accordingly. In the evidence of
the Bank Manager, no incriminating case is made out
against the respondent accused to connect him with the
crime in question.
10.     It is also on record that the investigation was handed
over initially to Rajabhai Pirabhai, Head Constable, LCB,
Palanpur who has sent the notes for checking after duly
filling of the form to the Government Press and thereafter he
tried to trace out the accused but nobody was found and
therefore, he filed “A” Summary in the case. Thus, at the
initial stage itself when the investigation was set in motion,
nobody was found to be the culprit behind the counterfeit
notes so the investigation was shut-down by filing “A”
Summary. As such, thereafter, in the year 1996 one Fax
message was received by the office of the DSP, Palanpur
stating that an accused is found in Bhuj for the offence of
counterfeit notes. On the basis of Transfer Warrant, the
present respondent accused was arrested on 22/5/1996
from Bhuj Sub Jail        and brought to Palanpur, as per the
deposition of PSI , Palanpur – Nathekhan PW No.6. From his
cross examination, nothing comes out on record to connect
the present respondent accused with the offence. It is
admitted by the PSI PW No.6 that except Fax message, no
evidence is against the respondent herein – original
11.    As per the evidence of Mr.Ansari, P.I. CID Crime,
Ahmedabad - PW No.7, he was the person who has sent the
Fax massage from his office to all the police stations in the
State, as a case being CR No.84 of 1996 was filed of
counterfeit notes in Bhuj Police Station and statement of
serial numbers of counterfeit notes was also prepared,
which was sent to all the DSPs along with the Fax Message.
It is admitted by the PW No.7 in his cross examination that
statement has not been prepared in his presence and he
has no knowledge regarding investigation of Bhuj Case
being CR No.84 of 1996.
12.    For the sake of arguments, even if the accused is
arrested in case of counterfeit notes in connection with Bhuj
Case being CR No.906 of 1996 and statement has been sent
by Fax, this aspect also does not               point out any
incriminating evidence against the respondent accused for
his involvement in the present case.
13.    The prosecution has not been able to prove the
presence of the present accused in Palanpur. No business
transaction with the PW No.1 has been proved. No material
is found in the present offence from the respondent accuse
which can relate the respondent accused with the present
offence. Merely on the basis of Transfer Warrant, the
accused has been implicate in this case. From the entire
evidence on record, no iota of evidence comes on record to
point out the guilt of the present respondent accused.
Under the circumstances, the learned trial judge has rightly
acquitted the respondent accused for the reasons stated in
the impugned judgement and order.
14.   It may be noted that as per the settled legal position,
when two views are possible, the judgment and order of
acquittal passed by the trial Court should not be interfered
with by the Appellate Court unless for the special reasons. A
beneficial reference of the decision of the Supreme Court in
the case of State of Rajasthan versus Ram Niwas reported
in (2010) 15 SCC 463 be made in this regard. In the said
case, it has been observed as under:-
“6. This Court has held in Kalyan v. State of U.P.,
“8. The settled position of law on the powers to be
exercised by the High Court in an appeal against
an order of acquittal is that though the High Court
has full powers to review the evidence upon which
an order of acquittal is passed, it is equally well
settled that the presumption of innocence of the
accused persons, as envisaged under the criminal
jurisprudence prevalent in our country is further
reinforced by his acquittal by the trial court.
Normally the views of the trial court, as to the
credibility of the witnesses, must be given proper
weight and consideration because the trial court is
supposed to have watched the demeanour and
conduct of the witness and is in a better position to
appreciate their testimony. The High Court should
be slow in disturbing a finding of fact arrived at by
the trial court. In Kali Ram V. State of Himachal
Pradesh, (1973) 2 SCC 808, this Court observed
that the golden thread which runs through the web
of administration of justice in criminal case is that
if two views are possible on the evidence adduced
in the case, one pointing to the guilt of the accused
and the other to his innocence, the view which is
favourable to the accused should be adopted. The
Court further observed:
"27. It is no doubt true that wrongful acquittals are
undesirable and shake the confidence of the
people in the judicial system, much worse,
however, is the wrongful conviction of an innocent
person. The consequences of the conviction of an
innocent person are far more serious and its
reverberations cannot but be felt in a civilised
society. Suppose an innocent person is convicted of
the offence of murder and is hanged, nothing
further can undo the mischief for the wrong
resulting    from   the        unmerited    conviction             is
irretrievable. To take another instance, if an
innocent person is sent to jail and undergoes the
sentence, the scars left by the miscarriage of
justice cannot be erased by any subsequent act of
expiration. Not many persons undergoing the
pangs of wrongful conviction are fortunate like
Dreyfus to have an Emile Zola to champion their
cause and succeed in getting the verdict of guilt
annulled. All this highlights the importance of
ensuring, as far as possible, that there should be
no wrongful conviction of an innocent person.
Some risk of the conviction of the innocent, of
course, is always there in any system of the
administration of criminal justice Such a risk can
be minimised but not ruled out altogether It may in
this connection be apposite to refer to the following
observations of Sir Carleton Alien quoted on page
157 of "The Proof of Guilt" by Glanville Williams,
"I dare say some sentimentalists would assent to
the proposition that it is better that a thousand, or
even a million, guilty persons should escape than
that one innocent person should suffer; but no
responsible and practical person would accept
such a view. For it is obvious that if our ratio is
extended indefinitely, there comes a point when
the whole system of justice has broken down and
society is in a state of chaos."
28. The fact that there has to be clear evidence of
the guilt of the accused and that in the absence of
that it is not possible to record a finding of his guilt
was stressed by this Court in the case of Shivaji
Sahebrao, (1973) 2 SCC 793, as is clear from the
following observations:
"Certainly it is a primary principle that the accused
must be and not merely, may be guilty before a
court, can be convicted and the mental distinction
between 'may be' and 'must be' is long and divides
vague conjectures from sure considerations."
“9. The High Court while dealing with the appeals
against the order of acquittal must keep in mind
the following propositions laid down by this Court,
namely, (i) the slowness of the appellate court to
disturb a finding of fact; (ii) the noninterference
with the order of acquittal where it is indeed only a
case of taking a view different from the one taken
by the High Court."
8.    In    Arulvelu    and     another    versus          State
reported in (2009) 10 Supreme Court Cases 206,
the Supreme Court after discussing the earlier
judgments, observed in para No. 36 as under:
“36. Careful scrutiny of all these judgments lead to
the definite conclusion that the appellate court
should be very slow in setting aside a judgment of
acquittal particularly in a case where two views
are possible. The trial court judgment can not be
set aside because the appellate court's view is
more probable. The appellate court would not be
justified in setting aside the trial court judgment
unless it arrives at a clear finding on marshaling
the entire evidence on record that the judgment of
the trial court is either perverse or wholly
unsustainable in law.”
15.    It is a cardinal principle of criminal jurisprudence that
in an acquittal appeal if other view is possible, then also,
the appellate Court cannot substitute its own view by
reversing the acquittal into conviction, unless the findings of
the trial Court are perverse, contrary to the material on
record,         palpably     wrong,        manifestly     erroneous               or
demonstrably unsustainable. (Ramesh Babulal Doshi V.
State of Gujarat (1996) 9 SCC 225). In the instant case,
the learned APP for the appellant has not been able to point
out to us as to how the findings recorded by the learned
trial Court are perverse, contrary to material on record,
palpably wrong, manifestly erroneous or demonstrably
16. In the case of Ram Kumar v. State of Haryana,
reported in AIR 1995 SC 280, Supreme Court has held as
“The powers of the High Court in an appeal from
order of acquittal to reassess the evidence and
reach its own conclusions under Sections 378 and
379, Cr.P.C. are as extensive as in any appeal
against the order of conviction. But as a rule of
prudence, it is desirable that the High Court
should give proper weight and consideration to the
view of the Trial Court with regard to the credibility
of the witness, the presumption of innocence in
favour of the accused, the right of the accused to
the benefit of any doubt and the slowness of
appellate Court in justifying a finding of fact
arrived at by a Judge who had the advantage of
seeing the witness. It is settled law that if the
main grounds on which the lower Court has based
its order acquitting the accused are reasonable
and plausible, and the same cannot entirely and
effectively be dislodged or demolished, the High
Court should not disturb the order of acquittal."
17. As observed by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case
of Rajesh Singh & Others vs. State of Uttar Pradesh
reported in (2011) 11 SCC 444 and in the case of
Bhaiyamiyan Alias Jardar Khan and Another vs. State of
Madhya Pradesh reported in (2011) 6 SCC 394, while
dealing with the judgment of acquittal, unless reasoning by
the learned trial Court is found to be perverse, the acquittal
cannot be upset. It is further observed that High Court's
interference in such appeal in somewhat circumscribed and
if the view taken by the learned trial Court is possible on the
evidence, the High Court should stay its hands and not
interfere in the matter in the belief that if it had been the
trial Court, it might have taken a different view.
18. Considering the aforesaid facts and circumstances of
the case and law laid down by the Hon'ble Supreme Court
while considering the scope of appeal under Section 378 of
the Code of Criminal Procedure, no case is made out to
interfere         with the impugned        judgment     and       order         of
19. In view of the above and for the reasons stated above,
present Criminal Appeal deserves to be dismissed and is
accordingly dismissed.
