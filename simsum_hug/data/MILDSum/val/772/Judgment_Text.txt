This Criminal Petition, under Section 439 of the Code of
Criminal Procedure, 1973, is filed to enlarge the petitioner on
2.     Heard learned counsel for the petitioner and learned
Additional Public Prosecutor for the respondent-State.
3.     The petitioner is A-1 in Sessions Case No.359 of 2017 on
the file of the learned IV Additional District and Sessions Judge
– cum – Special Judge for Trial of Offences against Women,
Anantapur. This is a case arising out of Crime No.78 of 2013 on
the file of Mahila Police Station, Anantapur, Anantapur District.
4.     A case under Sections 498-A and 307 read with 34 of the
Indian Penal Code, 1860 (for short “I.P.C.”) was registered
against the petitioner in the above crime. He was arrested in
connection with the above crime and subsequently, he was
enlarged on bail.     He was directed to appear before the trial
Court after receipt of summons after filing the charge sheet. It
appears that summons were issued to the petitioner for his
appearance in the trial Court after charge sheet was filed.
However, on the ground that the petitioner did not turn up for
trial, non-bailable warrant was issued against him.        As the
N.B.W. could not be executed as the petitioner was not found at
the address given by him at the time of granting bail,
proclamation was ordered under Section 82 Cr.P.C. Thereafter,
the N.B.W. was executed and the petitioner was arrested on
04.02.2022 and he was produced before the trial Court and
remanded to judicial custody on 05.02.2022.        Since then, he
has been in judicial custody.
5.    Learned counsel for the petitioner would submit that at
the time of arrest, the petitioner was residing in Anantapur and
thereafter, he has shifted his residence to Nellore and he has
been residing in Nellore.     Therefore, the summons that were
issued by the trial Court are not served on him and he has no
knowledge regarding the adjournments or dates given for his
appearance in the said case by the trial Court and as such, he
could not appear before the trial Court.     Therefore, he would
submit that the absence of the petitioner before the trial Court
is not deliberate or willful and it is only on account of the
aforesaid reasons that he could not appear before the trial
Court. Therefore, he prayed for grant of bail.
6.    Learned     Additional   Public  Prosecutor    opposed   the
Criminal Petition. He would submit that the petitioner did not
inform regarding change of address to the police to enable them
to serve summons on him at the place where he is now residing.
He further submits that the trial Court also, while observing
that he failed to inform his change of address to the police, held
that he is not entitled to bail.    Therefore, he would pray for
dismissal of the Criminal Petition.
7.    The fact that the petitioner has shifted his residence from
Anantapur to Nellore is not in dispute.       Similarly, summons
issued by the trial Court were not served on him is also not in
dispute. Therefore, the petitioner has no knowledge regarding
the fact that the charge sheet was filed against him and that
summons were issued to him. Therefore, as rightly contended
by the learned counsel for the petitioner, the absence of the
petitioner is not deliberate or willful. It is only on account of the
aforesaid reason that is explained by the petitioner that he could
not appear before the trial Court.         The petitioner is now a
permanent resident of Nellore District and he undertakes to
appear before the trial Court as and when directed till the trial
of the case is completed and case is disposed of. Therefore, in
the said facts and circumstances of the case, this Court is of the
considered view that the petitioner is entitled to be enlarged on
bail and more particularly, as he has been languishing in jail for
more than one month period i.e., from 05.02.2022.
8.     Resultantly, this Criminal Petition is allowed.           The
petitioner/A-1 is ordered to be enlarged on bail on execution of
self bond for Rs.50,000/- (Rupees fifty thousand only) with two
sureties for a likesum each to the satisfaction of the learned IV
Additional District and Sessions Judge – cum – Special Judge
for Trial of Offences against Women, Anantapur, Anantapur
District. On his release, the petitioner shall appear before the
trial Court and co-operate for completion of trial in the said
