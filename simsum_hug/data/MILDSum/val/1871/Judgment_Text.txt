Mr. Anil C. Singh, Additional Solicitor General a/w Mr. Jitendra B. Mishra
i/by Ms. Pankti Shah for Respondent Nos. 1 to 6.
Mr. Jitendra B. Mishra a/w Mr. Satyaprakash Sharma for Respondent
Ms. Jyoti Chavan, AGP for Respondent No.8.
1.           The Petition has been filed through a Director of a Company,
Aagya OOH Media Solutions Private Limited. We refer to the said Aagya
OOH Media Solutions Private Limited as Petitioner.
2.           Petitioner has been carrying on business of advertising and
providing advertising solutions to various parties. Petitioner submitted a
bid in response to a tender floated by Respondent No.1 through
Respondent No.6. Petitioner’s bid was accepted and a Letter of Acceptance
dated 16th July 2014 was issued to Petitioner by Respondent No.6 on
behalf of Respondent No.1. Clause 2.14 of the General Conditions of
Contract (GCC) provided for payment of service tax. It says “ As & when it
is notified for collection of service tax on commercial publicity contracts
on railways, the contractor should pay the service tax at the applicable
rates on the license fee to the Railway Administration ”. Petitioner was
paying the applicable service tax.
3.            In July, 2017 the service tax regime was replaced by Goods
and Services Tax (GST)-Central GST and State GST.
4.            As was done in the past, Petitioner continued to pay the
amount to Respondent No.6 together with GST component of 18% per
annum on the value of the services. The fact Petitioner made these
payments to Railways, together with the GST of 18% per annum, has been
admitted by Respondent No.6. The last assignment that Petitioner had
with Railways was for the Financial Year 2017-18.
5.            On or about 21st December 2020, Petitioner received a notice
from Deputy Commissioner of State Tax for conducting audit whereby
Petitioner was directed to attend in person or through an authorised
representative along with the books of accounts and records for the
Financial Year 2017-18. Petitioner responded by submitting requisite
documents and by answering all the queries of the audit team to the best
of its knowledge and ability.
6.           During the course of audit, Petitioner realised that the issue is
related to the amount of GST that Petitioner had paid to Railways, viz.,
through Respondent No.6. Petitioner addressed communications dated 3 rd
February 2022 and 23rd February 2022 to the office of Respondent Nos.4
and 5 seeking intervention on getting the issue of GST payment resolved
for the last five years. Petitioner realised that though Petitioner was
paying 18% GST to the Railways, that amount was not being paid by
Railways to the concerned authorities, i.e., 9% to the Central Government
and 9% to the State Government. To cut the matter short, this is where
the problem of Petitioner arose and Petitioner approached this Court for
appropriate relief.
7.           Respondent No.5, through one Manika Jaiswal, has filed
Affidavit-in-Reply, affirmed on 1st August 2022. In the Affidavit-in-Reply,
Respondent No.5 admits that Petitioner had paid the tax amounts to
Railways. The stand taken by Respondent No.5, however, is that as per the
provisions of Section 9 (3) of CGST/SGST Act, 2017 and Section 5(3) of
the IGST Act, 2017 the tax payable by the recipient of the goods or
services or both, as was applicable in the case at hand, shall be paid on
reverse charge basis.
8.           Learned ASG submitted that when it says on reverse charge
basis, the obligation was on Petitioner, who was recipient of services
under the contract, to pay the GST directly to the Central Government and
State Government at the applicable rates. Learned ASG also pointed out
that copy of the tax invoices raised on Petitioner, which has been annexed
to the Affidavit-in-Reply, also provides “Is Tax payable on Reverse Charge
Basis – yes”. Learned ASG pointed out that the CGST amount as well as
the SGST amount has also been mentioned in the invoice. Mr. Damani
stated that this is the first time Petitioner even could sight a copy of the
9.           The fact is Petitioner has paid the SGST and CGST, but has
paid those amounts to Railways instead of paying it directly to the
concerned tax authorities. In the Affidavit-in-Reply of Respondent No.5 it
is stated that the amount mentioned can be refunded to Petitioner or if
Petitioner wishes the amounts can be paid directly to the concerned
authorities in the proportion mentioned in the invoice within such period
as the Court may direct.
10.          We have to note that this is a case where Petitioner has not
attempted to evade any tax. This is a clear case where Petitioner has made
a mistake and instead of paying the Government of India through the
CGST authorities and the State of Maharashtra through the SGST
authorities, the entire amount has been paid to Government of India,
through Indian Railways. In the Affidavit-in-Reply, Respondent No.5
admits that Petitioner has paid the amount wrongly to Railways and due
to huge Railway network, Railway was not in an immediate administrative
position to check and react to such wrongful deposits.
11.          We, therefore, direct Respondent No.5 to ensure that the
amounts which have been wrongly paid by Petitioner to Railways should
be paid to the CGST authorities and SGST authorities within two weeks
from today.
12.           We also hope that in view of the unusual facts and
circumstances of this case, the CGST authorities and SGST authorities
would consider Petitioner’s case sympathetically when it comes to interest
and penalty. Unless they have some other reason, Petitioner should not be
saddled with interest and penalty.
13.           As and when Railway deposits the amount and we have
already observed that it will be done within two weeks from today, the
CGST and SGST authorities will give input tax credit to Petitioner.
14.           Petition disposed. No order as to costs.
15.           After this order was dictated, learned ASG pointed out that
since the GST payments are made electronically and the system will only
accept when the payment is made by party concerned, his instructions are
that it will not be possible to pay the amount directly to the CGST/SGST
authorities. Respondent No.5 is, therefore, directed to pay this amount to
Petitioner within one week. Petitioner shall pay this amount within one
week after receiving the credit in its account. The CGST/SGST authorities
are directed to open the portal for Petitioner. Mr. Mishra and Ms. Chavan
state that they will inform the concerned authorities of CGST/SGST,
respectively, to provide within one week the link/portal details to
Petitioner to make this payment. Statement accepted.
