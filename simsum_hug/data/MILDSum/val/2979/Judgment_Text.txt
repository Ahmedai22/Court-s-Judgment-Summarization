This is the third bail application under Section 439 of the
Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 filed on behalf of the applicant
for grant of bail. His first bail application i.e. M.Cr.C.No.2103/2021
was disposed of on 27/04/2021 and second bail application i.e.
M.Cr.C.    No.50669/2021        was    dismissed    as   withdrawn        on
09/12/2021. The applicant is in custody since 22/06/2018 in
connection with Crime No.451/2017 registered at Police Station –
Rau, District Indore (M.P.) for commission of offence punishable
under Section 363, 366, 376(2)(i), 376(2)(n) and 506-II of the
Indian Penal Code, 1860 read with Section 5(m)/6 and 5(l/6) of the
Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012.
As per prosecution story, the prosecutrix was minor and was
11 years of age at the time of incident. She knows the present
applicant before the incident. The present applicant abducted the
minor prosecutrix and kept her at his sister's village and committed
rape upon her and threatened her to kill if she disclosed anyone
about the incident. The sister of the prosecutrix lodged a missing
person report in respect of the prosecutrix. Accordingly, crime has
been registered against the present applicant.
Learned counsel for the applicant submits that the applicant
is innocent person and he has been falsely implicated in this
offence. He is in custody since 22/06/2018. Investigation is over
and charge sheet has been filed. Nine witnesses including the
prosecutrix have been examined by the prosecution. Medical
evidence is not supporting the prosecution version. Final conclusion
of the trial is likely to take sufficient long time. The applicant is
permanent      resident  of   Indore   district. Under      the    above
circumstances, prayer for grant of bail may be considered on such
terms and conditions, as this Court deems fit and proper.
Per contra, learned counsel for the respondent / State
opposes the bail application and prays for its rejection by
submitting that the prosecutrix was only 11 years of the age at the
time of incident and she categorically stated in her statement against
the present applicant. Hence, he is not entitled to be enlarged on
Counsel for the objector also opposes the bail application and
prays for its rejection.
I have perused the impugned order of the trial Court as well
as the case diary.
Considering all the facts and circumstances of the case,
nature and gravity of offence, arguments advanced by the learned
counsel for the applicant and also taking note of the fact that as per
the scholar register prosecutrix's date of birth is 08/03/2006,
therefore, she was below 12 years at the time of incident.
Prosecutrix has been examined before the trial Court and she has
categorically stated in her statement that present applicant abducted
and committed rape upon her several times.
At the stage of consideration of bail, marshalling of the
prosecution witnesses is not permitted as per the judgment of
Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Satish Jaggi Vs. State of
Chattisgarh & Ors. (Cr.A.No.651/2007) decided on 30/07/2007,
wherein it has been held as under:-
“At the stage of granting of bail, the Court can only go
into the question of prima facie case established for granting
bail. It cannot go into the question of credibility and
reliability of the witnesses put up by the prosecution. The
question of credibility and reliability of prosecution witnesses
can only be tested during the trial.”
As per the law laid down by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in
Satish Jaggi (supra), this Court can only go into the question of the
prima facie case established for granting bail. At the stage of
consideration of bail, this Court cannot go into the question of
credibility and reliability of the witnesses put up by the prosecution.
In the statement recorded before the trial Court, the prosecutrix has
categorically stated against the present applicant about the aforesaid
In view of the evidence available on record, as above,
without commenting upon the merits of the case, at this stage, this
Court is not inclined to enlarged the applicant on bail.
Accordingly, the third bail application filed by applicant
under Section 439 of Cr.P.C. is dismissed.
