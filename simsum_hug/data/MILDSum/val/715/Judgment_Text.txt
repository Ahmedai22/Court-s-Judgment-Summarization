1.     The petitioner has assailed the order dated
03.09.2020 passed by respondent no. 3- Commandant,
Etah, whereby the competent authority has found that
the petitioner is not suitable for appointment on the post
of Constable in the PAC.
2. Sri Arvind Kumar Singh, learned counsel for the
petitioner contends that the respondent No.3 was
misdirected in law by overlooking the fact that the
petitioner was tried for an offence as a juvenile. The
case of the petitioner is covered by the law laid down
by this Court in Rajiv Kumar Vs. State of U.P. and
another, reported at 2019 (4) ADJ 316, Shivam
Maurya Vs. State of U.P. and Others reported at
(2020) 5 ADJ 6 and in Kishan Paswan Vs. Union of
India and others reported at 2020 (11) ADJ 254. The
impugned order is arbitrary, illegal and violative of
fundamental rights of the petitioner guaranteed under
Articles 14, 16 and 21 of the Constitution of India.
3. Per contra, learned Standing Counsel submits that
the pendency of a criminal case and the suppression of
the same in the Attestation Form by the petitioner are
admitted. The offence against the petitioner was not of
a trivial nature, and moreover the petitioner had been
convicted by the learned trial court. He is not suitable
for appointment in a disciplined force like the
Provincial Armed        Constabulary     (PAC)  and   his
candidature was lawfully invalidated. The impugned
order is not liable to be interfered with.
4. Heard learned counsels for the parties.
5. The petitioner applied for appointment on the post
of Constable in the Civil Police and Provincial Armed
Constabulary (PAC) in response to an advertisement
issued by the Uttar Pradesh Police Recruitment and
Promotion Board, Lucknow, on 14.01.2018.
6.    The petitioner was successful in the written
examination and also qualified the physical standard
test. The petitioner was selected for appointment to the
post of Constable in the PAC and his name was shown
at serial no. 1350 of the select list taken out by the
respondent authority.
7. After the selection of the petitioner, an enquiry was
made by the Senior Superintendent of Police, Etah, into
the criminal antecedents of the petitioner and his
suitability for appointment to the post of Constable in
the PAC. The aforesaid enquiries revealed that the
petitioner had faced criminal prosecution consequent to
registration of Case Crime No. 104 of 2011, under
Sections 3/4 of U.P. Public Examinations (Prevention
of Unfair Means) Act, 1998. On account of the
aforesaid criminal case faced by the petitioner, the
petitioner was refused appointment as Constable in the
8. Aggrieved by the aforesaid denial of appointment,
the petitioner instituted a writ petition before this Court,
registered as Writ A No. 4270 of 2020, Anuj Kumar Vs.
State of U.P. and Others. The writ petition was decided
by a judgment rendered on 15.06.2020. The operative
portion of the aforesaid judgment in Anuj Kumar
“In view of the above, as no useful purpose would be served in
keeping the matter pending, with the consent of parties the matter
is being decided at this stage. It is directed that in case petitioner
approaches the respondent no. 3 through a comprehensive
representation alongwith certified copy of this order within fifteen
days from today, the respondent no. 3 shall consider and decide the
same, in accordance with law, keeping in mind the guidelines
issued by Apex Court in case of Avtar Singh (Supra), preferably
within a period of two months from the date of receipt of
representation of petitioner.
Writ petition stands disposed of.”
9. In compliance of the direction issued by this Court,
the case of the petitioner for appointment was
reconsidered by the competent authority in the
impugned order dated 03.09.2020.
10. The facts relevant for the adjudication of the
controversy are established beyond the pale of any
dispute in the impugned order. The facts being
undisputed, the controversy turns on pure questions of
law. No useful purpose will be served by exchange of
pleadings and prolonging the litigation. The matter is
being decided finally with consent of parties.
11. The undisputed facts necessary for adjudication for
this controversy can be prised out from the impugned
order dated 03.09.2020.
12. The impugned order dated 03.09.2020 after
extracting the operative portion of the judgment of this
Court dated 15.06.2020 in Anuj Kumar (Supra), records
that the petitioner has submitted a representation in
support of his candidature. The impugned order
thereafter finds that the perusal of the records reveal
that the petitioner had successfully qualified the written
examination as well as the physical standard test in the
selection proceedings for direct recruitment of PAC
Constable. An enquiry into the criminal antecedents
and character verification was initiated by the local
police at Etah.
13. The letter of the Senior Superintendent of Police,
Etah, dated 27.12.2019, is referenced in the impugned
order. The said letter discloses that Case Crime No. 104
of   2011,    under    Sections   3/4   of   U.P.  Public
Examinations (Prevention of Unfair Means) Act, 1998,
was registered against the petitioner and a chargesheet
was submitted in the learned trial court on 09.04.2011.
The matter was finally decided by the Lok Adalat on
28.08.2011 upon payment of penalty by the petitioner.
The report of the Senior Superintendent of Police, Etah,
contains a recital to the effect that the offence is of a
trivial nature and the current reputation of the petitioner
is good.
14.       The contents of the communication dated
27.12.2019 sent by the Senior Superintendent of Police,
Etah are stated. Thereafter the opinion of the District
Magistrate, Etah, sought in regard to the suitability of
the petitioner for appointment is discussed.
15. The District Magistrate Etah in the letter dated
15.01.2020, opined that in the aforesaid criminal case
the petitioner had confessed to his crime. Use of unfair
means is an offence which comes within the ambit of
“moral turpitude” as described in the Government
Order dated 28.04.1958. The petitioner had already
been punished by the trial court by imposition of
penalty. On the foot of the aforesaid reasoning, the
District Magistrate opined that the petitioner is not
suitable for appointment on the post of Constable in the
PAC. In view of the aforesaid opinion of the District
Magistrate Etah the petitioner was not issued an
appointment letter.
16. The impugned order then proceeds to quote the
opinion of the Joint Director Prosecution, District Etah
on 31.08.2020. The aforesaid opinion cites various
holdings in the case of Avtar Singh v. Union of India
and Others1, as set out in paragraph nos. 38.4.1, 38.4.2,
38.4.3 and 38.8.
17. The opinion records that the petitioner had not
raised a plea of juvenility before the learned trial court
by asserting that he was a juvenile at the time of the
institution of criminal case. Further the petitioner has
deposited the penalty of Rs. 250/- imposed by the
learned trial court and thus admitted to his guilt. The
provision of the Uttar Pradesh Public Examinations
(Prevention of Unfair Means) Act, 1998, provides for
two categories of punishments namely imposition of
penalty and imprisonment.
18. On the foot of the aforesaid reasoning, it is opined
that the petitioner was found guilty by the learned trial
court. After setting out the aforesaid material in the
impugned order, the competent authority agrees with
the same. The competent authority finally holds the
petitioner unsuitable for appointment on the post of
Constable in PAC on account of the penalty of Rs.
250/-, imposed by the learned trial court as a
19. The date of birth of the petitioner is 13.07.1995.
The offence for which the petitioner was prosecuted
occurred on 25.03.2011. On the date of the offence for
which the petitioner was prosecuted, he was 15 years 8
months 12 days old. The petitioner was juvenile within
the meaning of the Juvenile Justice (Care and
Protection of Children) Act, 2015.
20. These undisputed facts raise the following
I. Whether the petitioner can be denied appointment
on the footing of the prosecution and the conviction
of the petitioner by the Lok Adalat by order dated
05.11.2019, in Case Crime No. 104/2011, under
Sections 3/4 of U.P. Public Examinations (Prevention
of Unfair Means) Act, 1998.
II. Whether the respondents authorities erred in law
by requiring the petitioner to disclose details of
criminal prosecution faced by him as a juvenile in the
21.   The       said    questions        were       also     posed      for
determination before this Court in Rajiv Kumar Vs.
State of U.P. and another2.
22. I find that the Rajiv Kumar (supra) is squarely
applicable to the facts of this case. The judgment of
Rajiv Kumar (supra) is of some length. However, some
parts of the judgment can be usefully extracted.
23. The judgment of this Court in Rajiv Kumar (supra)
found that the aforesaid questions which arose for
consideration, involved an interface between various
“17. The controversy is defined by an interplay of different
branches of law and competing rights of individuals and
institutions. The interface of employers' rights, child rights and
employees' rights and a composite view and concerted
implementation of different branches of law, constitutional
rights, Juvenile Justice Acts, child rights regime, service law will
provide the way for the resolution of the controversy.”
24. The creation of children as a separate class in the
Constitution was looked at in light of relevant
“20. The constitution makers understood the special needs of
children and envisaged a distinct place for children in the
Constitution. The children are constituted into a separate class of
citizens under the Constitution. Various provisions devoted to the
child in the text of the Constitution attest the paramount
importance accorded to the welfare of the child in our
Constitutional scheme.”
25. Articles 15 (3), 21(a), 45, 47, 39(e) and 39(f) of the
Constitution of India were specifically invoked.
26. Rajiv Kumar (supra) entrenched the right to
reputation of a child as a fundamental right flowing
from Article 21 of the Constitution of India relying on
the law laid down by this Court in Sumpurnanand Vs.
State of U.P.3. Similarly, the fundamental right to
privacy of the child was also engaged by applying the
holding of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in K.S.
Puttaswamy v. Union of India4 .
27. Various international instruments in regard to
children in conflict with law were considered:
“38. The condition of children in conflict with law engaged the
concerns of the world community. The concerns were put in the
consciousness of the international community by the adoption
of the Beijing Rules in 1985 and the UN Standard Minimum
Rules for Administration of Juvenile Justice.
Administration of Juvenile Justice is a document which reflects
the consensus of international opinion and convergence of
values amongst civilized nations. In fact, the United Nations
Standard Minimum Rules For The Administration of Juvenile
Justice is a statement of universal values. The Juvenile Justice
Acts in India trace their origin to the aforesaid international
standards and other UN Conventions on the subject. As will be
seen the courts have readily incorporated the international
treaties and conventions into the corpus of our case law
28. The Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of
Children) Acts (enacted from time to time) were
examined in the context of various international
“52. The child rights jurisprudence reached the next stage in its
evolution, with the UN Convention on Rights of Child, 1989
and UN Juvenile Protection Rule, 1990. In the comity of
civilized nations, the state of children in conflict with law was
elevated from international consciousness to international
conscience, from conception of philosophy to agenda for
action. India honoured its international obligations and
cemented its international standing by promulgating The
Juvenile Justice Act, 2000 and then The Juvenile Justice Act,
53. The Juvenile Justice Act 1986 , the Juvenile Justice Act
2000 and the Juvenile Justice Act 2015 are in consequence of
and in consonance to the international covenants on child rights
in general and children in conflict with law in particular. The
enactments represent a conceptual shift from a strict retributive
approach to benign rehabilitative justice. The enactments are a
turning away of law from exclusion by penalizing to
assimilation by reintegration. The objects of the legislations
have been constant. The provisions have been amended to cope
with needs of the times and benefit from the fruits of
29. A survey of various provisions of the Juvenile
Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015 was
“Section 2.13 "child in conflict with law" means a child who is
alleged or found to have committed an offence and who has not
completed eighteen years of age on the date of commission of
Section 2.33 "heinous offences" includes the offences for which
the minimum punishment under the Indian Penal Code or any
other law for the time being in force is imprisonment for seven
Section 2.45. "petty offences" includes the offences for which
the maximum punishment under the Indian Penal Code or any
other law for the time being in force is imprisonment up to
Section 15 of the Act which contemplates a preliminary
assessment into heinous offences by the court and the
distinction created between heinous and non heinous offences
under the scheme of the Act was part of the discussion.
59. Of course, it needs to be clarified that the Juvenile Justice
Act, 2015 is prospective in its application. However, the
fundamental principles of Child Rights Jurisprudence or
position of law in regard to children in conflict with law which
are incorporated in the Act infact predate the statute.
60. Sections 74 and 99 of the Juvenile Justice Act, 2015
provide for protecting the identity of a child who has faced
criminal   prosecution   under     the  Juvenile     Justice Act,
2015. Section 24 much likeSections 74 and 99, has been a
consistent theme in the preceding enactments relating to
children in conflict with law. Section 24 removes any
disqualification of a child on the findings of an offence under
the Act. Sections 24, 74 and 99 of the Juvenile Justice Act 2015
are as follows.”
30. Other aspects of the Juvenile Justice (Care and
Protection of Children) Act, 2015, supported the
"24. Removal of disqualification on the findings of an offence.
1.    Notwithstanding anything contained in any other law for
the time being in force, a child who has committed an offence
and has been dealt with under the provisions of this Act shall

the age of sixteen years and is found to be in conflict with law
by the Children's Court under clause (i) of sub-section (1)
of section 19, the provisions of sub-section (1) shall not apply.
2.    (2) The Board shall make an order directing the Police, or
by the Children's court to its own registry that the relevant
records of such conviction shall be destroyed after the expiry of
the period of appeal or, as the case may be, a reasonable period

1.   No report in any newspaper, magazine, news-sheet or
audio-visual media or other forms of communication regarding
any inquiry or investigation or judicial procedure, shall disclose
the name, address or school or any other particular, which may

child in need of care and protection or a child victim or witness
of a crime, involved in such matter, under any other law for the
time being in force, nor shall the picture of any such child be
Provided that for reasons to be recorded in writing, the Board
or Committee, as the case may be, holding the inquiry may
permit such disclosure, if in its opinion such disclosure is in the
best interest of the child.
2.   The Police shall not disclose any record of the child for
the purpose of character certificate or otherwise in cases where
the case has been closed or disposed of.
3.   Any person contravening the provisions of sub-section (1)
shall be punishable with imprisonment for a term which may
extend to six months or fine which may extend to two lakh
rupees or both.
99. Reports to be treated as confidential.
1.   All reports related to the child and considered by the
Committee or the Board shall be treated as confidential:
Provided that the Committee or the Board, as the case may be,
may, if it so thinks fit, communicate the substance thereof to
another Committee or Board or to the child or to the child's
parent or guardian, and may give such Committee or the Board
or the child or parent or guardian, an opportunity of producing
evidence as may be relevant to the matter stated in the report.
2.   Notwithstanding anything contained in this Act, the victim
shall not be denied access to their case record, orders and
61. Rule 14 of the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of
Children) Model Rules, 2016 has relevance to the controversy.
The Rule provides for destruction of records. The intention of
legislature to efface the records of prosecution of a child is
The records of conviction in respect of a child in conflict with
law shall be kept in safe custody till the expiry of the period of
appeal or for a period of seven years, and no longer, and
thereafter be destroyed by the Person-in-charge or Board or
Provided that in case of a heinous offence where the child is
found to be in conflict with law under clause (i) of sub section
(1) of section 19 of the Act, the relevant records of conviction
of such child shall be retained by the Children's Court.
62. The Hon'ble Supreme Court in Jitendra Singh v. State of
U.P. reported at (2013) 11 SCC 193, considered various aspects
of child rights jurisprudence in the context of Juvenile Justice
Act 2000 and also the International Convention on the Rights
of the child and the Beijing Rules. The right to privacy and
confidentiality of a juvenile, the inability of a child to know its
rights, the imperative of rehabilitation and safeguards of law
were issues on which the Hon'ble Supreme Court ruled that:
41. The Rules, particularly Rule 3, provide, inter alia, that in all
decisions taken within the context of administration of justice,
the principle of best interests of a juvenile shall be the primary
consideration. What this means is that "the traditional
objectives of criminal justice, that is retribution and repression,
must give way to rehabilitative and restorative objectives of
juvenile justice". The right to privacy and confidentiality of
a juvenile is required to be protected by all means and
through all the stages of the proceedings, and this is one of
the reasons why the identity of a juvenile in conflict with
law is not disclosed. (emphasis supplied)
Following the requirements of the Convention on the Rights of
the Child, Rule 3 provides that institutionalisation of a child or
a juvenile in conflict with law shall be the last resort after a
reasonable inquiry and that too for the minimum possible
"32.Rehabilitation and social reintegration.--The primary aim
of rehabilitation and social reintegration is to help children in
restoring their dignity and self-worth and mainstream them
through rehabilitation within the family where possible, or
otherwise through alternate care programmes and long-term
institutional care shall be of last resort."
43. It is quite clear from the above that the purpose of the Act is
to rehabilitate a juvenile in conflict with law with a view to
reintegrate him into society. This is by no means an easy task
and it is worth researching how successful the implementation
of the Act has been in its avowed purpose in this respect.
44. As regards procedurally dealing with a juvenile in conflict
with law, the Rules require the State Government concerned to
set up in every district a Special Juvenile Police Unit to handle
the cases of juveniles or children in terms of the provisions of
the Act (Rule 84). This Unit shall consist of a juvenile or child
welfare officer of the rank of Police Inspector having an
aptitude and appropriate training and orientation to handle such
cases. He will be assisted by two paid social workers having
experience of working in the field of child welfare of which
one of them shall be a woman.
45. Rule 75 of the Rules requires that while dealing with a
juvenile or a child, except at the time of arrest, a police officer
shall wear plain clothes and not his uniform.
46. The Act and the Model Rules clearly constitute an
independent code for issues concerning a child or a juvenile,
particularly a juvenile in conflict with law. This code is
intended to safeguard the rights of the child and a juvenile in
conflict with law and to put him in a category separate and
distinct from an adult accused of a crime.
31. It needs to be mentioned that the Juvenile Justice
(Care and Protection of Children) Acts were amended
from time to time. However, fundamental principles of
child rights jurisprudence and constitutional rights of a
child which have remained constant also guided the
decision in Rajiv Kumar (supra).
32. The consideration of the scheme of the enactments
is concluded in the following paragraphs:
“65. The diminished culpability of children rests on the
premise of lack of maturity and an underdeveloped sense of
responsibility in children and that the deficiencies are reversible
which will be reformed with advancing age and neurological
development. The heightened capacity for change in juvenile
delinquents holds the promise of a new sunrise.
67. From the features and the scheme of the Juvenile Justice
Act (as amended from time to time) and law laid down by
various courts, both the legislative intent and the position of
law can be deduced with clarity. Intention of the legislature is
to treat children as a separate class in prosecution of
offences committed by the children.
68. Rigors of the prosecution have been diluted in the
criminal procedure. The legislature and the law has gone
the whole length to protect the identity of children who
have faced prosecution. Non disclosure of the details of the
crime committed by the child is another feature which
reflects a sensitive approach of the legislature to children in
conflict with law. (emphasis supplied)
69. Finally the legislations culminate in the overarching aim of
rehabilitating children who had trouble with the law by
assimilating them in the social mainstream.
70. By removing all disqualifications accruing from the
finding of guilt or a conviction of a juvenile under the Acts,
the final hurdle in the reintegration of a child in the society
has been removed.” (emphasis supplied)
33. The scope of the rights of the State as an employer
to ascertain the criminal antecedents of its perspective
80. The State employer examines the criminal antecedents of its
employees prior to their induction in government service.
81. Criminal antecedents are an accepted criteria to form an
opinion on criminal traits in an individual and his suitability for
employment. A person may be denied entry into government
service or removed from government service if found in
possession of such criminal traits.
85. A false declaration on oath regarding past prosecution in a
criminal case or a conviction in a criminal offence or pendency
of a criminal case could invalidate the appointment and entail
termination of services. Some authorities would have it that
such false affidavit would ipso facto result in the termination of
the services of the employee. The other view took mitigating
circumstances into account. The divergence in judicial views
was finally resolved by a three Judge Bench of the Hon'ble
Supreme Court in the case of Avtar Singh v. Union of India and
Others, reported at (2016) 8 SCC 471.
89. Clearly the right of the State as an employer to know
the criminal antecedents of its employees is unexceptional.
But the rights are not unrestricted in case of children. The
rights of the employer are limited by three constraints. The
rights of an employer have to be reconciled to provisions of
the Constitution and the propositions of Constitutional law.
Thirdly the employer's rights are also circumscribed by the
statutory regimes of child rights.” (emphasis supplied)
34. The interface of the rights of the State as an
employer and a child's fundamental rights was made in
“90. The rights of an employer are hedged, by the
constitutional rights of a child. The interplay of the employer's
rights with the constitutional rights of a child may now be
91. A nuanced approach is required to understand the ambit of
the right to reputation of a child and right to privacy of a child
guaranteed under Article 21 of the Constitution of India.
92. In the wake of the preceding narratives, certain fundamental
precepts can be distilled from the range of statutes and
pronouncements of courts which form the first principles of
child rights jurisprudence. These fundamental principles of
child rights jurisprudence would lend perspective and aid the
understanding of Constitutional rights of children under Article
14 and Article 21 of the Constitution of India.
93. The vulnerability of a child is an attribute of childhood
which is recognized by all legislatures. The incapacity of a
child to know its rights is a given in child rights' jurisprudence.
The inability of a child to assert its rights is a disability which
is understood by all courts. The aim of the legislatures and the
endeavour of the courts is to insulate the child from the cruel
vagaries of life which it cannot comprehend and lacks the
capacity to defend against. Reform of children in conflict with
law, their reintegration in society and creation of a salutary
environment for children to grow and realize their potentialities
is the high purpose to which the legislatures and the courts have
directed their efforts. Children have special needs in life and
require special protection in law. The indispensable feature of
all child rights' legislations is the special protection to children
provided by the legislature in a given field.
As an old writer observed on the incapacity of infants-
"The law protects their persons, preserves their rights and
estates, excuseth their laches and assists them in their
pleadings, the judges are their counsellors, the jury are their
servants and law is their guardian.
94. As we have seen that fate of children in conflict with law
has engaged the attention of the legislature, the courts and the
larger comity of nations and international organizations. The
collective endeavours have been guided by common purpose.
Children in conflict with law need special care. The criminal
justice system has to be sensitized to deal with the class of
children in conflict with law. The child has to be protected from
harsh treatment and should not be exposed to the rough edges
of the criminal justice system. The child has to be shielded
from all aspects and consequences of the criminal justice
system which can cast a lasting trauma or precludes it from
leading a normal life free from blemish and prevents the
reintegration of the child in the society.
95. One most critical feature of child rights regime is the
issue of the taint caused by criminal prosecution and the
disability    accruing     from     criminal   conviction.    The
consequent impediments in the reintegration of the
delinquent child in the society are issues which are
addressed by the legislatures and the courts alike. Some
measures like restricted access to records of trials sealing
and destruction of records of prosecution of juvenile
delinquents are finding acceptability among legislatures
across the world. Courts have been anonymising trials of
children conflict with law to protect their identities.
96. All these issues and first principles thus lie at the heart
of child rights jurisprudence, animate the purpose of child
rights legislation and engage the "life" of a child
under Article 21 of the Constitution of India.
97. Of course, persons between 16-18 years of age prosecuted
for heinous crimes, have been put in a separate class by the
legislature. They may be denied the protective cover of the
child rights regime as per provisions of law.
98. A past prosecution of a child in a criminal case which
remains in public records pertaining to employment
becomes part of public discourse. In public employment,
past prosecution of a child in a criminal case is often made a
criteria for forming an opinion of the child's criminal
antecedents. Such criteria revives the taint of a past
prosecution to blight the prospects of future employment. A
reference to a past prosecution will tarnish the reputation of
a child and become a permanent stigma in his life.
Consideration of a past prosecution of child in a criminal
case for any purpose or in any discourse, will create a
perpetual disability for the child. The practice of making
the past prosecution a criteria for forming an opinion of the
child's criminal     antecedents   or even making it         a
consideration     in  public   employment      will  provoke
consequences which the child rights regime seeks to
prevent. The consideration of a past prosecution of a child
in a criminal case will prevent reintegration of the child in
the mainstream of the society. It will pose an impediment in
the reformation of the child and the growth of the child into
a responsible adult. It will disable the all around
development of the child into a law abiding citizen. It will
preclude realization of the mandate of Article 39 of the
Constitution of India. These circumstances will violate the
child rights regime and the "life" of a child as guaranteed
under Article 21 of the Constitution of India will be devoid
of meaning.
99. The right of privacy of a child would be meaningful if
such prosecution is not made part of public discourse as a
criteria for appointment to public posts or admission to any
institution of learning or for that matter any other
transaction in life.
100. Similarly, the right to privacy in the context of a child
would include his right to deny information relating to his
prosecution as a child under the Juvenile Justice Act and
for offences which do not come in the category of heinous
offences under the said Act.
101. The prerequisite for realizing the Fundamental Rights
of a child vested by Article 21 of the Constitution of India,
is to create all conditions essential for reintegration of the
child in the social mainstream and to open opportunities for
self development and self fulfillment, free from the taint of
the past. The fact of the prosecution has to be purged from
public records to rid the child of the taint.
102. The wide consensus of such values helps us in
determining the rights of a child. The endeavours of the courts
and the legislatures alike is to protect the identity of the child
offender, and to shield the child in conflict with law from
suffering lasting and traumatic consequences of criminal
prosecution. A child who has been prosecuted for criminal
offence is entitled to a fresh chance in life. The child has to
begin life as an adult on a clean state, as if no such criminal
prosecution happened. This is possible when the fact of such
criminal prosecution is purged from public discourse and is
not a consideration for appointment to an office. The denial
of public space and legitimacy to the fact of such criminal
prosecution is the sheet anchor of the right to privacy and
right to reputation of a child. An employer cannot elicit any
information from any candidate or employee regarding the
prosecution of the latter in a criminal case as a minor child
for non heinous offences. An employer is precluded from
seeking a declaration from a candidate or an employee
regarding the prosecution of the latter in a criminal case as
103. These prerequisites create an environment which fosters a
balanced growth of a child and enables it to realize its full
potentialities. These prerequisites accord meaning to the life
of a child as contemplated under Article 21 of the
Constitution of India. This is the essence of the fundamental
right guaranteed to a child by Article 21 of the Constitution
104. The Directive Principles of State Policy enshrined
in Article 39 of the Constitution of India are infact the
mandatory requirements of law to bring the rights of a child
vested by Article 21 of the Constitution of India to fruition.
105. The meaning of life for children contemplated in Article
21 would be fruitful, if conditions of life for children envisaged
under Article 39 are created.”
35. The requirement posed by the State employer to a
candidate to disclose the details of criminal prosecution
faced as a minor / juvenile was also tested on the anvil
“109. Legislative enactments treat children differentially from
adults. Children are constituted in a separate class from adults
in law. The treatment accorded to children in law is
different from that of adults. This differential treatment
underlies the sensitive approach to children in law. The
criminal prosecution of a child is not at par with the
prosecution of an adult for a similar crime. The said
prosecution and the consequences of such prosecutions
cannot be treated alike. Law ensures that the adverse
consequences of prosecution of child are not only mitigated
but are completely obviated.
110. Children in conflict with law are a well defined class.
This class cannot be treated like adults. Children are not
"miniature adults".
111. It has been held by good authority that treating
unequals as equals will militate against the mandate
of Article 14 of the Constitution of India.
112. The criteria of past criminal prosecution for forming
an opinion about considering a criminal antecedents of a
candidate is a valid one. This criteria which is valid for
adults, would be flawed if applied to children. This would
amount to treating unequals as equals. A logical sequitor is
that fact of a past criminal prosecution of a child is not a
relevant consideration for appointment to a public post or
office and is violative of Article 14 of the Constitution of
113. Arbitrariness is another facet of Article 14 of the
Constitution of India. Arbitrary action or criteria is negated
by Article 14. This aspect of Article 14 is also engaged in the
instant controversy. Some facts stated in detail in the preceding
part of judgment are reproduced in substance hereunder:
114. The personality of a child is in constant evolution and
his (sic) character traits are not permanent. The causes
which impel a child to be on the wrong side of law or
commit deviant acts are often traceable to his (sic)
environment. A child has no control over his (sic)
environment and his (sic) deviant behaviour is reversible. A
child's conduct is capable of correction and a child is
reformed over the years. Good authority in law and the
field of child psychology has concluded that the character
traits which impelled a child into a criminal act are
transient and will be reformed with age.
115. In such a situation, the criteria of considering the past
crimes committed by an employee as a child do not form a
reliable, rational and a just basis for making an assessment
of criminal traits and to determine suitability for
employment.       This   criteria    would    be  an   irrelevant
consideration for appointment to a public post. Above all
such     criteria   is   wholly     arbitrary    and   flagrantly
violates Article 14 of the Constitution of India.” (emphasis
36. The line of enquiry then shifted to the restrictions
created on the rights of an employer by various
Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Acts,
which produced the undermentioned limitations:
“(B). Employers' Righs and Juvenile Justice Act, 1986 and
116. The critical feature and the guiding philosophy of child
rights jurisprudence and Juvenile Justice Act, 1986 and also
Juvenile Justice Act, 2015 is to prevent the child from
reoffending and to reintegrate the child in the society, to enable
the child to grow into a reformed and a responsible adult and a
law abiding citizen. The aim can be achieved if the taint of a
past criminal prosecution does not blight the future prospects of
a child. A past aberration as a child cannot define his future life
as an adult. The aim of reintegrating the child in the society
would be defeated in detail if the fact of a past prosecution
stigmatizes the future life of the child. Not only conviction but
the criminal prosecution itself carries a stigma.
117. The future of a child, in conflict with law will be secure
and the reintegration of child will be complete, only if the taint
of a past criminal prosecution is purged from his life. The
legislature, the prosecution agencies, the employers and the
courts have a responsibility in this regard. The legislature has
gone the whole length by providing that disqualification will
result from a conviction of the child under the Juvenile Justice
Act 1986 as well as the Juvenile Justice Act, 2015.
118. Salient features of the Juvenile Justice Act, 1986 protect
the child not only from the rigor of the criminal prosecution but
also from the consequences of conviction under the said Act.
119. As we have seen earlier that the Juvenile Justice Act, 1986
also provides for non disclosure of details of the child who
faced prosecution and restricts access to the records relating to
such prosecution. Destruction of records of prosecution faced
by the child is another provision reflecting a clear intent of the
120. Section 25 of the Juvenile Justice Act, 1986 quoted earlier,
protects the child from the consequences accruing from the
conviction under the Act and mandates that such conviction
under the Act cannot operate as a disqualification against such
121. If the conviction of a child under the Juvenile Justice
Act, 1986 is not a disqualification for appointment, it stands
to reason that prosecution of a child in a criminal case
cannot operate as a disqualification too. The important
logical corollary is that the criminal prosecution faced by an
employee as a child cannot become the criteria for forming
an opinion about criminal antecedents and suitability for
appointment. It is an irrelevant consideration. The material
considered and standards adopted to form an opinion about
the antecedents and suitability of adults for appointment on
public posts cannot be applied to children who had trouble
with the law or to a candidate who faced criminal
prosecution as a child.”
125. The Constitutional rights of a child and statutory
rights of a child guaranteed under the Juvenile Justice Act
1986 cannot be implemented in silos. Every agency of
governance including State employers are under an
obligation to implement the rights of a child guaranteed by
the constitution and protected by the Juvenile Justice Act,
37. The current case falls in the ambit of Juvenile
Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2000, but
the above said reasoning would fully apply here.
38. Finally in Rajiv Kumar (supra) the holdings were
“157…..The insistence of the State employer on a disclosure
of criminal prosecution faced as a child reflected an
impersonal attitude and a rote response to child rights. This
is not an environment which fosters a healthy development
of children and where rights of children flourish.
158. The requirement posed by the respondents to the
petitioner to make a declaration disclosing details of
criminal prosecution faced by the latter, insofar as it
included the criminal prosecution faced by the petitioner as
a minor child of 10 years was in violation of the
fundamental rights of the petitioner guaranteed by Article
14 and 21 of the Constitution of India and in the teeth of
Section 25 of the Juvenile Justice Act, 1986.
159. The details of past prosecution faced by the petitioner
as a child was not a valid criteria nor a lawful consideration
to judge his suitability for appointment. Such criteria was
arbitrary and illegal.
160. The declaration made by the petitioner was not a
relevant consideration in the appointment of the petitioner.
Hence, even the falsity of the declaration made by the
petitioner could not invalidate his appointment.
161. The petitioner in defence of his fundamental rights
vested by Article 14 and 21 of the Constitution of India,
could hold his silence or decline to disclose details of the
prosecution in a criminal trial faced by him as a minor child
of 10 years. Such action or declaration of the petitioner
cannot be faulted with. The services of the petitioner cannot
be terminated on the foot of such action or declaration.”
39. A similar view was taken by a Division Bench of
this Court in Shivam Maurya Vs. State of U.P. and
“14. The said Act is a beneficial legislation. The principles of
such beneficial legislation are to be applied only for the
purpose of interpretation of this statute. The concealment of the
pendency of criminal case against the appellant-petitioner was
of no consequence. As per the requirement of law a conviction
in an offence will not be treated as a disqualification for a
juvenile. The records of the case pertaining to his involvement
in a criminal matter are to be obliterated after a specified period
of time. The intention of the legislature is clear that in so far as
juveniles are concerned their criminal records is not to stand in
their way in their lives. The cancellation of the candidature of
the appellant-petitioner was thus bad. The authority concerned
failed to appreciate the fact that the appellant-petitioner was
entitled to benefit of the provisions of Act of 2000. The
cancellation of the candidature of the petitioner goes contrary
to the object sought to be achieved by the Act of 2000. Section
19 of the Act of 2000 protects a juvenile and any stigma
attached to his conviction is also removed. The Act of 2000
does not envisage incarceration of a juvenile which clearly
shows that the intention and object was not to shut the doors of
a disciplined and decent civilised life. It provides him an
opportunity to mend his life for the future.
15. We thus hold that the authority concerned fell in complete
error in not extending the benefit of Act of 2000 to the
appellant-petitioner particularly when there are specific
provisions provided therein to take care of a juvenile being
implicated, tried and / or convicted in a criminal matter. We
thus extend the benefit provided under Section 19 of the Act of
2000 to the appellant-petitioner.”
40. While construing the provisions of Section 19 of
the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children)
Act, 2000, insofar as they remove any disqualification
attaching to a conviction under the said Act, the
Division Bench of the Calcutta High Court in the case
of Sahadeb Ghosh Vs. State of West Bengal5 held thus:
"Section 19 of the said Act of 2000 clearly says that, notwithstanding
anything contained in any other law, a juvenile, who, has committed an
offence and has been dealt with under the provisions of the said Act of
2000, shall not suffer disqualification, if any, attaching to a conviction of
an offence under such law.
Therefore, if conviction does not become a bar and/or disqualification, it
is unacceptable that pendency of a proceeding against a juvenile can be a
A benefit sought to be given by the legislature under section 19 of the said
Act of 2000 cannot be obliterated. Logical corollary of the said provision
is that even if a juvenile is convicted, such conviction would not act as
disqualification. Even, under sub-section (2) of section 19 of the said Act
of 2000 records of such conviction are to be removed after the period of
expiry of appeal or alter a reasonable period as prescribed under the
We are of the opinion that inactions on the part of the authorities are
against the provisions of the said Act of 2000. It goes contrary to the
object sought to be achieved by the said Act of 2000. Section 19 of the
said Act of 2000 protects a juvenile and any stigma attached to his
conviction is, also, removed. The approach should be to condone minor
indiscretions made by young people than to brand them as criminal for
the rest of his life. The said Act of 2000 does not envisage incarceration of
a juvenile nor wants to shut on him the doors of a decent and disciplined
civilised life. On the contrary, it opens for him such a vista by providing
him an occasion to amend and regulate his delinquency. The Courts are
not to thwart such a course for him by either caprice, bias or any
impractical or unimaginable reason.
We hold that benefits sought to be given to a convicted person under
section 19 of the said Act of 2000 read with the said Rules of 2007 shall
equally apply to a person against whom a case is pending before the
Juvenile Justice Board. Thus, the authorities cannot refuse to give
appointment to the writ petitioner on the sole ground of pendency of a
criminal case before the said Board.
We are unable to accept the contention of Mr. Majumdar that this Court in
exercise of the power of judicial review is unnecessarily interfering with
the managerial functions of the State by extending the benefits of
section 19 of the said Act of 2000 to the writ petitioner. We are simply
extending the benefits provided under section 19 of the said Act of 2000
as provided by the legislatures in their wisdom.
We, therefore, set aside the order of the tribunal and direct the authorities
to complete the police verification of the petitioner irrespective of
pendency of his case before the Juvenile Justice Board and to consider his
case for appointment for the post of constable of police on the basis of
such report, keeping in mind the intention of the legislature as enshrined
41. The said judgements rendered by this Court and
Calcutta High Court in Rajeev Kumar (supra), Shivam
Maurya         (supra) and  Sahadeb      Ghosh     (supra)
respectively were also followed in Kishan Paswan Vs.
Union of India and others6. The holdings of the Courts
are consistent in successive cases in point.
42. From the preceding legal narrative, the following
I. Juveniles and adults form separate classes. Criminal
prosecution of an adult is a lawful basis for
determination of suitability of a candidate for
appointment to public office. However prosecution of
juveniles is in a separate class. Using criminal
prosecution faced by a candidate as a juvenile to form
an opinion about his suitability for appointment, is
arbitrary illegal and violative of Article 14 of the
Constitution of India.
II. The requirement to disclose details of criminal
prosecutions faced as a juvenile is violative of the right
to privacy and the right to reputation of a child
guaranteed under Article 21 of the Constitution of
India. It also denudes the child of the protection assured
by the Juvenile Justice Act, 2000 (as amended from
time to time). Hence the employer cannot ask any
candidate to disclose details of criminal prosecution
faced as a juvenile.
III. The candidate can hold his silence or decline to
give information about the criminal prosecution faced
as a juvenile. Denial of such information by the
candidate will not amount to a false declaration or a
willful suppression of facts.
IV. The conviction by a Juvenile Justice Board under
the Juvenile Justice Act, 2000 of a juvenile is not a
disqualification   for  employment. As        a  sequitor
prosecution faced as a juvenile is not a relevant fact for
forming an opinion about the criminal antecedents and
suitability of the candidate for appointment.       Such
prosecution cannot be made a basis for denial of
appointment. Non disclosure of irrelevant facts is not
“deliberate” or willful concealment of material facts.
Hence non-disclosure of such criminal cases cannot
invalidate the appointment of the said person.
These holdings shall not apply to cases beyond the
ambit of Juvenile Justice Act, 2000 (as amended from
time to time) and also in cases of heinous crimes
committed by persons in the age group of 16 to 18
43. The undisputed facts narrated in the preceding part
of the discussion establish the fact that the petitioner
was a juvenile within the meaning of the Juvenile
Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2000 (as
amended from time to time), on the date of the
commission of the alleged offence. He is entitled to the
protection of th said Act considering the nature of the
offence he was prosecuted for. Merely because the
petitioner did not raise the plea of juvenility before the
learned trial court, does not denude him of the
protection conferred upon him by law. The offence in
issue is not a heinous crime. Further the impugned
order is vitiated by its failure to consider the
unimpeached report of the police authorities that the
petitioner enjoys a good social reputation.
44. The questions posed earlier are answered in terms
of the preceding holdings.
A. Prosecution and imposition of penalty upon the
petitioner by the Lok Adalat in the judgment dated
05.11.2019, rendered in Case Crime No. 104/2011,
under Sections 3/4 of U.P. Public Examinations
(Prevention of Unfair Means) Act, 1998, cannot be the
basis of denial of appointment to the petitioner. The
said proceedings are not relevant criteria for purposes
of appointment of the petitioner. I find that the
respondents authorities have acted in a manner contrary
to law by requiring the petitioner to disclose criminal
prosecution faced by him as a juvenile.
45. The competent authority had misdirected itself in
law by finding the petitioner unsuitable for appointment
and him appointment on the post of Constable in PAC.
46. The impugned order dated 03.09.2020 is arbitrary
and illegal. The order dated 03.09.2020 passed by the
Armed Constabulary (PAC), District Etah, is liable to
be set aside and is set aside.
47. A writ in the nature of mandamus is issued
commanding the respondents to execute the following
i. The appointment of the petitioner shall be
processed in light of the observations made in
this judgment.
ii. The appointment letter shall be issued to him
in accordance with law.
iii. The petitioner shall be given the seniority, he
would have been entitled to but for cancellation
of his candidature by the impugned order.
48. The writ petition is allowed.
