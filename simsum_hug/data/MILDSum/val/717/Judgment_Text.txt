1.      This petition has been filed under Sections 397/401 Cr.P.C.
challenging Order dated 09.11.2021 in case bearing M.T. 1358/2018
wherein the Ld. Judge, Family Courts, North-East, Karkardooma, Delhi,
directed the Petitioner/Husband to pay an interim maintenance of Rs.
20,000/- per month to the Respondent/Wife with effect from the date of
filing the petition, i.e. 17.12.2018.
2.      The facts, in brief, leading up to the filing of the petition are as
a)   It is stated that the parties were married on 10.07.1989 and two
sons were born to them. Matrimonial disputes arose between the
parties in 2013 and it has been alleged that the Respondent/Wife
treated the Petitioner/Husband with cruelty. Thereafter, the
CRL.REV.P. 126/2022                                                        Page 1 of 9
Petitioner/Husband and the Respondent/Wife started residing
separately with the Petitioner living with his elder son and the
Respondent living with the younger son.
b)     In December 2015, the Respondent/Wife allegedly forcibly
entered the property of the Petitioner/Husband and started living
in a portion of the house. In 2018, vide Settlement dated
16.08.2018 (notarized on 21.08.2018), the Petitioner/Husband
agreed to pay the Respondent/Wife a sum of Rs. 5,000/- per
month.
c)     On 17.12.2018, the Respondent/Wife filed a petition under
Section 125 Cr.P.C., along with an application for interim
maintenance, wherein she alleged that she had been treated with
cruelty and that the Petitioner/Husband was earning Rs.
3,00,000/-    per    month.   This    was   contested   by      the
Petitioner/Husband who stated that the Respondent/Wife was
earning Rs. 40,000/- per month and that he himself was an auto
driver.
d)     Vide Mediation Settlement on 13.01.2020, it was agreed that the
Petitioner/Husband would continue giving an amount of Rs.
5,000/- to the Respondent/Wife. However, vide impugned Order
dated 09.11.2021, the Ld. Family Court directed the
Petitioner/Husband to pay a sum of Rs. 20,000/- to the
Respondent/Wife per month as an interim maintenance.
e)     Aggrieved by the same, the Petitioner/Husband has now
approached this Court challenging the same by way of the
instant revision petition.
3.     Mr.     Rajinder   Mathur,    learned    Counsel   appearing   for     the
Petitioner/Husband, submits that a settlement dated 16.08.2018 between the
Petitioner and the Respondent had already been arrived at wherein the
Petitioner had agreed to pay a sum of Rs. 5,000 per month towards the
maintenance of the Respondent. He states that the petition filed by the
Respondent/Wife under Section 125 Cr.P.C. is replete with falsities as she
alleges that the Petitioner/Husband is earning more than Rs. 3 lakhs in her
main petition, but states that he is earning Rs. 50,000/- in her interim
maintenance application.
4.     Mr. Mathur submits that in reality, the Respondent/Wife is a money
lender and is earning about Rs. 40,000/-, and that the Petitioner/Husband is
merely an auto driver earning about Rs. 12,000/- per month and not a
businessman as has been alleged by the Respondent/Wife. He states that the
impugned Order dated 09.11.2021 is erroneous and is liable to set aside on
the ground that it states that no payments have been made till date which is
contrary to the fact that the Petitioner herein has been paying Rs. 5,000/- per
month to the Respondent in compliance of the settlement deed dated
16.08.2018. He further states that the Ld. Family Court also erred in not
considering the Mediation Settlement dated 13.01.2020 wherein the
Respondent/Wife had agreed to accept a payment of Rs. 5,000/- per month.
5.     The learned Counsel appearing for the Petitioner/Husband, therefore,
states that the Ld. Family Court has erred in not taking into account either
the payments that were being made regularly by the Petitioner/Husband to
the Respondent/Wife in compliance of both the settlements between the
parties. He further submits that the impugned Order dated 09.11.2021 should
be set aside on account of the fact that the Petitioner/Husband is an auto

driver earning only Rs. 12,000/- per month and, therefore, cannot pay the
monthly maintenance of Rs. 20,000/- as has been directed vide Order dated
6.     Heard Mr. Rajinder Mathur, learned Counsel appearing for the
Petitioner, and perused the material on record.
7.     Section 125 Cr.P.C. is a provision that has been enacted to ensure that
women and children are provided maintenance by the husband so as to
protect them from a life of potential vagrancy and destitution. The Supreme
Court has consistently upheld that the conceptualisation of Section 125 was
meant to ameliorate the financial suffering of a woman who had left her
matrimonial home; it is a means to secure the woman’s sustenance, along
with that of the children, if any. The statutory provision entails that if the
husband has sufficient means, he is obligated to maintain his wife and
children, and not shirk away from his moral and familial responsibilities.
8.     The Supreme Court examined the underlying purpose as well as the
social context of Section 125 Cr.P.C. in Bhuwan Mohan Singh v. Meena &
Ors., (2015) 6 SCC 353. The relevant paragraph reads as under:
"2. Be it ingeminated that Section 125 of the Code of
Criminal Procedure (for short “the Code”) was
conceived to ameliorate the agony, anguish, financial
suffering of a woman who left her matrimonial home
for the reasons provided in the provision so that some
suitable arrangements can be made by the court and
she can sustain herself and also her children if they are
with her. The concept of sustenance does not
necessarily mean to lead the life of an animal, feel like
an unperson to be thrown away from grace and roam
for her basic maintenance somewhere else. She is
entitled in law to lead a life in the similar manner as
she would have lived in the house of her husband. That
CRL.REV.P. 126/2022                                                   Page 4 of 9
is where the status and strata come into play, and that
is where the obligations of the husband, in case of a
wife, become a prominent one. In a proceeding of this
nature, the husband cannot take subterfuges to deprive
her of the benefit of living with dignity. Regard being
had to the solemn pledge at the time of marriage and
also in consonance with the statutory law that governs
the field, it is the obligation of the husband to see that
the wife does not become a destitute, a beggar. A
situation is not to be maladroitly created whereunder
she is compelled to resign to her fate and think of life
“dust unto dust”. It is totally impermissible. In fact, it
is the sacrosanct duty to render the financial support
even if the husband is required to earn money with
physical labour, if he is able-bodied. There is no
escape route unless there is an order from the court
that the wife is not entitled to get maintenance from the
husband on any legally permissible grounds."
9.     Therefore, while adjudicating upon a matter of maintenance, it is
important for the Courts to bear in mind that the same was enumerated to
further the cause of social justice and that the interpretation of this Section
should be done in a manner to prevent a situation wherein the wife or
children are inadvertently nudged into vagrancy and destitution. It is meant
to provide a speedy remedy for the supply of food, clothing and shelter to
the deserted wife.
10.    Furthermore, the scope of interference in a revision petition under
Sections 397/401 Cr.P.C. read with Section 482 Cr.P.C. is narrow and can
only be done if a situation arises wherein the impugned Order is replete with
legal infirmities and is unconscionable to the rule of law. The Supreme
Court in Amit Kapoor v. Ramesh Chander, (2012) 9 SCC 460, has observed
CRL.REV.P. 126/2022                                                    Page 5 of 9
"12. Section 397 of the Code vests the court with the
power to call for and examine the records of an
inferior court for the purposes of satisfying itself as to
the legality and regularity of any proceedings or order
made in a case. The object of this provision is to set
right a patent defect or an error of jurisdiction or law.
There has to be a well-founded error and it may not be
appropriate for the court to scrutinise the orders,
which upon the face of it bears a token of careful
consideration and appear to be in accordance with
law. If one looks into the various judgments of this
Court, it emerges that the revisional jurisdiction can
be invoked where the decisions under challenge are
grossly erroneous, there is no compliance with the
provisions of law, the finding recorded is based on no
evidence, material evidence is ignored or judicial
discretion is exercised arbitrarily or perversely. These
are not exhaustive classes, but are merely indicative.
Each case would have to be determined on its own
merits.
13. Another well-accepted norm is that the revisional
jurisdiction of the higher court is a very limited one
and cannot be exercised in a routine manner. One of
the inbuilt restrictions is that it should not be against
an interim or interlocutory order. The Court has to
keep in mind that the exercise of revisional
jurisdiction itself should not lead to injustice ex facie.
Where the Court is dealing with the question as to
whether the charge has been framed properly and in
accordance with law in a given case, it may be
reluctant to interfere in exercise of its revisional
jurisdiction unless the case substantially falls within
the categories aforestated. Even framing of charge is a
much advanced stage in the proceedings under the
CRL.REV.P. 126/2022                                                    Page 6 of 9
20. The jurisdiction of the court under Section 397 can
be exercised so as to examine the correctness, legality
or propriety of an order passed by the trial court or the
inferior court, as the case may be. Though the section
does not specifically use the expression “prevent abuse
of process of any court or otherwise to secure the ends
of justice”, the jurisdiction under Section 397 is a very
limited one. The legality, propriety or correctness of an
order passed by a court is the very foundation of
exercise of jurisdiction under Section 397 but
ultimately it also requires justice to be done. The
jurisdiction could be exercised where there is palpable
error, non-compliance with the provisions of law, the
decision is completely erroneous or where the judicial
discretion is exercised arbitrarily. On the other hand,
Section 482 is based upon the maxim quando lex
aliquid alicui concedit, concedere videtur id sine quo
res ipsa esse non potest i.e. when the law gives
anything to anyone, it also gives all those things
without which the thing itself would be unavoidable.
The section confers very wide power on the Court to do
justice and to ensure that the process of the court is not
permitted to be abused."            (emphasis supplied)
11.   Similarly, in Sanjaysinh Ramrao Chavan v. Dattatray Gulabrao
Phalke, (2015) 3 SCC 123, the Supreme Court observed as under:
"14. In the case before us, the learned Magistrate went
through the entire records of the case, not limiting to
the report filed by the police and has passed a
reasoned order holding that it is not a fit case to take
cognizance for the purpose of issuing process to the
appellant. Unless the order passed by the Magistrate is
perverse or the view taken by the court is wholly
unreasonable or there is non-consideration of any
relevant material or there is palpable misreading of
CRL.REV.P. 126/2022                                                    Page 7 of 9
records, the Revisional Court is not justified in setting
aside the order, merely because another view is
possible. The Revisional Court is not meant to act as
an appellate court. The whole purpose of the revisional
jurisdiction is to preserve the power in the court to do
justice in accordance with the principles of criminal
jurisprudence. The revisional power of the court under
Sections 397 to 401 CrPC is not to be equated with
that of an appeal. Unless the finding of the court,
whose decision is sought to be revised, is shown to be
perverse or untenable in law or is grossly erroneous or
glaringly unreasonable or where the decision is based
on no material or where the material facts are wholly
ignored or where the judicial discretion is exercised
arbitrarily or capriciously, the courts may not interfere
with decision in exercise of their revisional
jurisdiction."
12.     It is pertinent to note at this juncture that the maintenance which has
been awarded vide the impugned Order dated 09.11.2021 is in the form of
interim maintenance. Judicial discipline, therefore, circumspects this Court
from interfering in an Order rendered by the Courts below and only justifies
interference if the Order is egregious in nature and suffers from legal
perversity. It is well settled that unless the said Orders are perverse and have
been passed on nil evidence, the High Court must be slow in interfering in
the decisions of the Courts below.
13.     A perusal of the impugned Order dated 09.11.2021 indicates that the
Ld. Family Court has astutely considered the affidavits of income, assets and
liabilities as well as other documents filed by both the parties before arriving
at the decision to direct the Petitioner/Husband to pay a sum of Rs. 20,000/-
per month as interim maintenance. The Ld. Family Court has taken
cognizance of the said settlement deed and noted that no material was placed
CRL.REV.P. 126/2022                                                    Page 8 of 9
on record to substantiate the submission of the Petitioner/Husband that a
regular interim maintenance of Rs. 5,000/- was being paid to the
Respondent/Wife. Furthermore, the Ld. Family Court has also gone through
the Petitioner/Husband’s bank statements and copy of Income Tax Returns
as on 31.03.2020, and has found that the Petitioner/Husband earned Rs.
5,17,395/- in the financial year 2019-2020.
14.    Moreover, it was also found by the Ld. Family Court that in the
assessment year 2020-2021, the Petitioner/Husband had sales of Rs.
85,93,417/- and also had a miscellaneous income of Rs. 48,910/-.
Accordingly, the Ld. Family Court came to the conclusion that the
Petitioner/Husband had a monthly income of Rs. 60,000/- and, therefore, had
the wherewithal to pay maintenance to the Respondent/Wife. In consequence
of the same, it was directed that the Respondent/Wife was entitled to an
interim maintenance of Rs. 20,000/- per month from the date of filing of the
petition, i.e. 17.12.2018.
15.    In view of the above, this Court is of the opinion that the impugned
Order dated 09.11.2021 passed by the Ld. Family Court is well-reasoned and
does not betray any legal infirmity. This Court, therefore, does not find any
reason that would warrant interference in the Order passed by the Ld. Family
16.    Accordingly, the petition is dismissed, along with the pending
application(s), if any.
