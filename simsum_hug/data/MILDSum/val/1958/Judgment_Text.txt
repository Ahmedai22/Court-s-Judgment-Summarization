I.A.No.1/2022 under Section 320(2)(8) read with section 482 of Cr.P.C. seeking
permission to compound the offence.
6.      Learned counsel for the petitioners and learned counsel for respondent No.2
have contended that the petitioners and respondent No.2 are Mohammedans and as
per Mohammedan law, if a girl is aged 15 years and after attaining puberty, they can
perform marriage and accordingly, the marriage was performed. Now the victim has
attained majority and delivered a child, which is two months old. Both the parties have
settled down their issue and therefore, prayed for quashing the criminal proceedings.
In respect of their contentions, a joint affidavit is filed by the petitioners and respondent
No.2 before the Court.
7.      Learned counsel for the petitioners has relied upon the judgment of the Punjab
and Haryana High Court in case of MOHD. SAMIM VS. STATE OF HARYANA AND
OTHERS decided in W.P. No.532/2018 (O&M) on 26.09.2018 and also the judgment
of the High Court of Delhi in case of FIJA AND ANOTHER VS. STATE
GOVERNMENT OF NCT OF DELHI AND OTHERS in W.P. (Criminal) No.763/2022
decided on 17.08.2022 and also the judgment of Coordinate Bench of this Court in
8.      Having heard learned counsel for the parties, perused the records. The records
reveal that petitioner No.1 is said to be the husband of the victim. The victim was aged
about 17 year and 2 months at the time of her pregnancy, now she has attained
majority and delivered a child. The marriage was said to be an arranged marriage
performed by the parents of the victim as well as accused No.1. Accused Nos.2 and
4 are the in laws of the victim and accused No.3 is said to be the mother of the victim.
The marriage was performed at Mysuru and it was performed according to the
Mohammedan tradition and the marriage certificate was also issued by Masjid
authorities. The High Court of Delhi in a similar situation in Fija's case, cited supra,
has quashed the criminal proceedings considering the POCSO Act as well as IPC and
Child Marriage Restraint Act. The Punjab and Haryana High Court in a similar case in
case of Mohd. Samim, cited supra, has also quashed the proceedings. The
Coordinate Bench of this Court in Criminal Petition No.4172/2022 has taken a similar
view and quashed the criminal proceedings. The joint affidavit of both the parties
shows that the parties have settled the issue in dispute.
9.      Considering the facts and circumstances of the case, continuing to allow
criminal proceedings is abuse of process of law and no purpose would be served if
the victim turns hostile during trial and the question of conducting investigation against
the petitioners by the investigation officer is a futile exercise. Therefore, I.A.No.1/2022
filed by the both parties has to be allowed and accordingly, it is allowed. Both the
parties are permitted to settle the dispute and compound the offence.
10.     Consequently, criminal petition is allowed. the criminal proceedings pending on
the file of Additional City Civil and Sessions Judge, Bengaluru in Special C.C.
No.1667/2022 for the offences punishable under sections 376, 376(2)(N) of IPC,
Sections 5(L), 6 and 17 of POCSO Act and Section 9 and 11 of Child Marriage
Restraint Act, against petitioners-accused Nos.1 to 4 is hereby quashed.
