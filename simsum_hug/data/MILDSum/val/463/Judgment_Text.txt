1.       By this writ petition the petitioner father intends to invoke the
Constitutional powers of this Court under Article 226 and 227 of the
Constitution of India to challenge the order passed by learned
Additional Sessions Judge, Ahmednagar, District Ahmednagar, on 25-
04-2019 in Criminal Revision Application No.236 of 2017                         thereby
allowing the said revision filed by the present respondent son and
setting aside the order of grant of maintenance passed by learned
Judicial Magistrate First Class, Shevgaon, District Ahmednagar, in
Criminal Misc.Application No.153 of 2014 by order dated 06-10-2017,
under Section 125 of Cr.P.C. The learned Additional Sessions Judge,
Ahmednagar by the said revision has dismissed the said application
filed by the father against the son for maintenance.
2.      The relationship between the petitioner and the respondent is
not disputed.         It is stated that the petitioner had three daughters
and only one son i.e. present respondent. The wife of the petitioner
is still alive, but she stays separately from the petitioner but with the
respondent. According to the petitioner, he had no source of income
and due to his old age he is unable to do any work.                         He had
therefore filed the said application under Section 125 of Cr.P.C. for
maintenance. The learned Magistrate after taking into consideration
the evidence on record had come to the conclusion that the
petitioner is unable to maintain himself, respondent had refused to
maintain his father and the son is capable of maintaining father.
Under such circumstances, he had granted maintenance @ of
Rs.5000/- per month from the date of the original application i.e.
3.      The present respondent/son challenged the said order in said
Criminal Revision No.236 of 2017 and reversing all the findings of
the learned Magistrate, the learned Additional Sessions Judge had
set aside the order passed by the Magistrate and dismissed the
original application. Hence, this writ petition.
4.      Heard learned Advocate Mr. N. D. Batule for petitioner, learned
Advocate Mr. D. R. Marked holding for learned Advocate Mr. G. P.
Darandale for respondent. Perused the affidavit-in-reply filed by the
respondent, documents filed along with it, then affidavit-in-rejoinder
by the petitioner stating that his present age is 75 years.               Once
again there is surrejoinder by the respondent son stating that the
petitioner had agricultural land admeasuring 57 R and he has sold
the same to one Sunil Chandrabhan Admane on 09-11-2015 for a
consideration of Rs.3 lakh.     However, according to the son, actual
consideration amount was Rs.7,50,000/-, but it has been shown less
in the sale deed.
5.      From the submissions those have been made on behalf of both
the sides what could be gathered is that at present the age of the
petitioner is around 73 to 75 years. It has now come on record and
the learned Advocate for the respondent admits that now there is no
land left with the petitioner.    The question is then, what is the
source of income for the petitioner. Learned Magistrate had already
held that he has no source of income.           No doubt it was then
reversed by the revisional Court taking into consideration the said
sale deed executed on 09-11-2015.          Even if for the sake of
arguments we accept that there was a piece of land for the
petitioner, but whether that is giving him sufficient income to
sustain, is a question, and whether his physical ability is allowing
him to cultivate the land or get it cultivated through anybody so that
he can earn. The son cannot avoid his responsibilities to maintain
the father.        It appears that he is putting a condition that the
petitioner should come and stay along with him like mother.                       The
son cannot impose such condition. Unfortunately now the situation
has arisen for the father that he is unable to maintain himself and
then he is required to depend upon somebody else.                     The son is
trying to say that because of the vices of the father, there is
differences between the mother and the father and they are not
residing together.            So also now the petitioner is demanding the
money just to fulfill his vices.         We cannot go into these disputed
facts forever.         We are required to see as to whether there is a
source of income for the petitioner which could give him sufficient
amount to support and then there is responsibilities of son to
maintain the father, and therefore, the finding which has been
arrived at by the learned revisional Court only on the technical basis
that some amount was received by the petitioner in the past
because of the sell and the so called admission of the petitioner that
by doing labour work he is getting wages @ of Rs.20/- per day. The
said order could not have been totally discarded. At the most, the
revisional Court by applying proper criteria could have reduce that
amount to make it sustainable for both the parties. The income of
the son is also then required to be considered because he is already
support his own family as well as the mother. The approach taken
by the revisional Court appears to be too hyper technical and when
it comes to petitions under Section 125 of Cr.P.C., the Courts cannot
be so hyper technical in their approach. The said provision is made
for the immediate support that too financial in nature of a person so
that he or she can survive.              Therefore, taking into consideration
these aspects, definitely the Constitutional powers of this Court
deserve to be invoked in this case when such too technical approach
is taken and the petitioner is forced to earn now at this age of 73 to
75 years in view of the dismissal of the original application under
Section 125 of Cr.P.C.
