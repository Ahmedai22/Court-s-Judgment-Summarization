Vide this petition, the petitioner seeks to invoke the jurisdiction
of this court under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973, to
quash FIR no.0115, dated 14.02.2021, registered at Police Station Hansi,
District Hansi, wherein it is alleged that offences punishable under Sections
153-A and 153-B of the IPC, as also Section 3 (1)(u) of the Scheduled Castes
and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities), Act, 1989 (hereinafter
referred to as the Act), have been committed. [Subsequently, as submitted
before this court, an offence punishable under Section 3(1)(s) of the Act has
also been added in the FIR.]
The grounds spelt out in the petition for quashing the FIR, can
be essentially summed up as follows:-
(i)             That respondent no.2 (complainant) 'does not have
clean hands' and has misinterpreted the issue to be one as an act
in violation of the provisions of the Act;
(ii)            That respondent no.2 has no locus standi to
register the FIR as the word in question (bhangi) as was used
by the petitioner, was neither directed at him nor at any other
member of the dalit community; and therefore the motive of the
said respondent, in getting the FIR registered, was only to
blackmail the petitioner and to extract money from him;
(iii)           That none of the ingredients of either Sections
153-A and 153-B of the IPC, or of Section 3(1)(u) of the Act,
would be made out, with no specific allegation (in reference to
them), having been levelled against the petitioner, because in
the entire FIR there is no averment of the petitioner promoting
enmity between any different groups on grounds of religion,
race, place of birth, residence etc., or of doing any act
prejudicial to maintenance of harmony, or being prejudicial to
national integration etc.;
(iv)            That the FIR thus deserves to be quashed on the
aforesaid grounds, as also in terms of the ratio of various
judgments of the Supreme Court, cited as follows:-
a. Subhash Kashinath Mahajan vs. State of Maharashtra,
b. Jones vs. State, 2004 Crl.LJ 2755;
c. Inder Mohan Goswami and another vs. State of
Uttranchal and others, (2007) 12 SCC 1;
d. State of Karnataka vs. L.Muni Swami and others, AIR
e. Som Mittal vs. Govt. of Karnataka, (2008) 2 SCC
f. State of Haryana vs. Ch. Bhajan Lal, 1991 (1) RCR
2.             When the petition first came up for hearing, the contentions
initially raised by counsel for the parties on the date, (with notice of motion
issued and with an interim order thereafter passed by this court at that stage),
are also considered appropriate to be reproduced at this initial stage itself, in
this judgement. Thus, the relevant part of the order dated 25.02.2021, is
reproduced as regards the arguments raised on that date by learned senior
counsel appearing for the petitioner, and learned counsel for the complainant
“Mr. Bali, learned senior counsel appearing for the
petitioner, submits that, firstly, the person in reference to whom the
allegedly casteist remarks are stated to have been made (though
denied), does not belong to a Scheduled Caste and hence, they could
not be said to be casteist remarks.
He next submits that the remarks were made in the
context of the person concerned (Yuzvendra Chahal) “having made”
his father dance at a marriage ceremony (as contended), and therefore
the remarks were in the context of somebody being in an inebriated
condition, with him thereafter submitting that bhang is also an
intoxicant and the word ‘bhangi’ had been used by the petitioner in
that context.
He points to paragraph 5 of the petition, in which it is
stated that term used, ‘bhangi’, was not intended to hurt the sentiments
of any community or any person, but was a friendly comment made by
the petitioner to his friends and colleagues who are not part of the
“respected dalit community”.
Mr. Bali next points to the provision in respect of which
the petitioner is stated to have committed an offence, i.e. Section 3 (1)
(u) of the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of
Atrocities) Act, 1989, which reads as follows:-
“3. Punishments for offences of atrocities.—
(1) Whoever, not being a member of a Scheduled Caste
or a Scheduled Tribe,—
(u) by word either written or spoken or by signs or by
visible representation or otherwise promotes or attempts to
promote feelings of enmity, hatred or ill-will against members
of the Scheduled Castes or the Scheduled Tribes;
shall be punishable with imprisonment for a term which
shall not be less than six months but which may extend to five
years and with fine.”
Mr. Bali submits that even the context of the word used
in the “Instagram chat” by the petitioner with his friend, would not
impute any kind of ill-will, enmity or hatred, or any attempt to promote
such feelings, it having been used in the context of one persons’ father
dancing in a marriage ceremony, with that person not belonging to any
scheduled caste.
Mr. Bali also submits that the complainant in the FIR in
question, is a person who has made many complaints against many
celebrities and important people etc. and that he would be filing the
details of such complaints in due course, he having received that
information only today.
Learned senior counsel also refers to paragraph 6 of the
petition, wherein it has been stated that a person called Rajat had
approached the petitioner through the petitioners’ manager, in the
month of June, 2020, to find ‘means to close the issue’, in which
context he points to Annexure P4, which is stated to be a photograph
of the said person, whom learned senior counsel submits, as per the
instructions of the petitioner, is a person known to the complainant.
Notice of motion, with Mr. Surender Singh, learned
AAG, Haryana, accepting notice on behalf of the respondent State at
the asking of the court and with Mr. Arjun Sheoran, Advocate,
appearing for the complainant and also accepting notice on his behalf,
copies of the petition already having been received by both the
counsel.
instructions, the matter is still under investigation
Mr. Sheoran, learned counsel for the complainant,
submits that, firstly, as regards the person referred to as Rajat in
paragraph 6 of the petition, the complainant makes a categorical
statement that he does not know him and so the question of that person
ringing up the petitioner to demand money on behalf of the
complainant, would not arise in the first place.
He next submits that admittedly the word “bhangi”
having been used, it refers to a caste listed in the Scheduled Castes
notified by the Government of Haryana and further, therefore the
phrase used being “ye bhangi log ko koi kaam nahi hain”, it would be
encompassing the whole community, and therefore it cannot be said
that there is no violation of the aforesaid provision of the Act of 1989.
He also relies upon a judgment of the Supreme Court in
Amish Devgan v. Union of India (2021) 1 SCC 1, from which he
refers to paragraph 76, which reads as follows:-
“52. Persons of influence, keeping in view their
reach, impact and authority they yield on general public or the
specific class to which they belong, owe a duty and have to be
more responsible. They are expected to know and perceive the
meaning conveyed by the words spoken or written, including
the possible meaning that is likely to be conveyed. With
experience and knowledge, they are expected to have a higher
level of communication skills. It is reasonable to hold that they
would be careful in using the words that convey their intent.
The reasonable-mans test would always take into consideration
the maker. In other words, the expression reasonable man
would take into account the impact a particular person would
have and accordingly apply the standard, just like we substitute
the reasonable mans test to that of the reasonable professional
when we apply the test of professional negligence. 98 This is
not to say that persons of influence like journalists do not enjoy
the same freedom of speech and expression as other citizens, as
this would be grossly incorrect understanding of what has been
stated above. This is not to dilute satisfaction of the three
elements, albeit to accept importance of who when we examine
harm or impact element and in a given case even intent and/or
content element.”
Learned counsel further submits that the judgment relied
upon in the petition, in the case of Subhash Kashinath Mahajan v.
State of Maharashtra (2018) 6 SCC 454, has been ‘reviewed’ by the
Supreme Court in the judgment in Union of India v. State of
Maharashtra (2020) 4 SCC 761 and consequently is no longer good
law. He refers to paragraphs 52 and 54 of the latter judgment, which
“52. There is no presumption that the members of the Scheduled
Castes and Scheduled Tribes may misuse the provisions of law
as a class and it is not resorted to by the members of the upper
Castes or the members of the elite class. For lodging a false
report, it cannot be said that the caste of a person is the cause. It
is due to the human failing and not due to the caste factor. Caste
is not attributable to such an act. On the other hand, members of
the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes due to backwardness
hardly muster the courage to lodge even a first information
report, much less, a false one. In case it is found to be
false/unsubstantiated, it may be due to the faulty investigation or
for other various reasons including human failings irrespective
of caste factor. There may be certain cases which may be false
that can be a ground for interference by the Court, but the law
cannot be changed due to such misuse. In such a situation, it can
be taken care in proceeding under section 482 of the Cr.PC.
54. As a matter of fact, members of the Scheduled
Castes and Scheduled Tribes have suffered for long, hence, if we
cannot provide them protective discrimination beneficial to
them, we cannot place them at all at a disadvantageous position
that may be causing injury to them by widening inequality and
against the very spirit of our Constitution. It would be against the
basic human dignity to treat all of them as a liar or as a crook
person and cannot look at every complaint by such complainant
with a doubt. Eyewitnesses do not come up to speak in their
favour. They hardly muster the courage to speak against upper
caste, that is why provisions have been made by way of
amendment for the protection of witnesses and rehabilitation of
victims. All humans are equal including in their frailings. To
treat SCs. and STs. as persons who are prone to lodge false
reports under the provisions of the Scheduled Castes and
Scheduled Tribes Act for taking revenge or otherwise as
monetary benefits made available to them in the case of their
being subjected to such offence, would be against fundamental
human equality. It cannot be presumed that a person of such
class would inflict injury upon himself and would lodge a false
report only to secure monetary benefits or to take revenge. If
presumed so, it would mean adding insult to injury, merely by
the fact that person may misuse provisions cannot be a ground to
treat class with doubt. It is due to human failings, not due to the
caste factor. The monetary benefits are provided in the cases of
an acid attack, sexual harassment of SC/ST women, rape,
murder, etc. In such cases, FIR is required to be registered
promptly.”
Thus, the contention raised is that simply because the
complainant is a social activist, he is not precluded from raising an
issue which affects the society at large and with the petitioner being
a celebrity who has crores of followers on the instagram app (as
contended), the chat in question would have been followed by all
such ‘followers’, as also by the followers of his other celebrity
friends with whom he was in conversation.
Last, Mr. Sheoran submits today that the video
clipping and the utterances therein having been admitted by the
petitioner, the present petition does not deserve to be entertained as
it is still to be investigated, and consequently should be dismissed;
and this not being a petition seeking “anticipatory bail” for the
petitioner, no order in that regard should be passed by this court.
In part rebuttal to the aforesaid argument, as regards the
judgment cited by counsel for respondent no.2, Mr. Bali cites a
judgment of the Supreme Court in the case of Hitesh Verma v.
The State of Uttarakhand and another (Criminal Appeal no.3585
of 2020, decided on 05.11.2020), to submit that the judgment of the
Constitution Bench in Union of India v. State of Maharashtra was
duly considered in Hitesh Vermas’ case and it was held that in an
appropriate case, even qua an FIR registered under the provisions
of the Act of 1989, a Constitutional Court would not be precluded
from invoking jurisdiction under the provisions of Section 482 of
the Cr.P.C., to quash such FIR.
However, to that contention, learned counsel for
respondent no.2 submits that the said judgment is not at all relevant
to the present case because it was wholly in a different context as
was the judgment referred to in Hitesh Vermas’ case, i.e. Ishwar
Pratap Singh & Others v. State of Uttar Pradesh and another,
3.          Upon hearing the aforesaid arguments on that date, the
following observations were made by this court, in that very order:-
Having considered the matter at this stage with
investigation still underway, this court would not exercise
jurisdiction to stop investigation, but in view of the fact that at least
prima facie at this stage, the term in question being subject to two
interpretations, i.e. as to whether it was used against any particular
community (or in the context of any community) or was in
reference to a person who was in an inebriated condition, with the
person concerned (Yuzvendra Chahal) admittedly not belonging to
any scheduled caste even as per learned counsel for the
complainant, no coercive action shall be taken against the
petitioner, subject of course to the reply to be filed by the
respondents herein.
It is of course to be observed by this court that the Act
of 1989 is a legislation enacted to safeguard the interests of a
section of society that has been known to be oppressed since ages.
Naturally any violation of the provisions of the said Act have to be
dealt with strictly to try and ensure that a sense of well being is
instilled in such sections of society, towards which every person,
and ‘celebrities’ in particular, should be careful in the usage of any
term which can be misinterpreted; yet, as already said hereinabove,
since the specific contention of the learned senior counsel
appearing for the petitioner is that the term sued (sic) by the
petitioner was wholly in the context of persons in an inebriated
condition, the interim direction hereinabove has been made, subject
to the outcome of the investigation and the reply to be filed
accordingly by a gazetted officer in that regard.
Since learned State submits that he may be given four
weeks time to file a reply as regards the investigation carried out,
adjourned to 26.03.2021.”
4.           Coming then to the contentions raised in the petition, it is stated
by the petitioner at the outset that he is a victim of gross persecution and
harassment at the hands of respondent no.2, who has initiated malicious
prosecution by abusing the process of law.
The petitioner further goes on to state that in April 2020, he and
his colleague, Rohit Sharma, had a live chat, on a social media platform,
namely Instagram, “to inter alia discuss as to how lives have become amidst
the pandemic and the then prevailing lock-down.”
It is next stated in the petition that from June, 2020, onwards,
the video recording was circulated on various social media platform with a
malicious attempt to “malign and harm the reputation of the petition”, with
false allegations levelled against him to the effect that he had violated the
provisions of the Act by disrespecting the “respected dalit community.”
It is next stated that the petitioner while in such conversation
with Rohit Sharma, referred to two other persons (Yuzvendra Chahal and
Kuldeep Yadav), by referring to them as “Bhangi (in a friendly manner)”
with the said two persons being colleagues and friends of the petitioner, with
therefore there being no intent to disrespect them or any community during
the conversation.
5.           Subsequently, on June 05, 2020, the petitioner is also stated to
have released a public statement apologizing for the aforesaid remarks and
clarifying that “he does not disparage anyone on the basis of colour, caste,
creed or gender and that he truly believes in the dignity of life and has
respect for each individual without exception”.
Thus a press release to that effect is stated to have been made by
the petitioner, a copy of that statement having been annexed as Annexure P-1
with the petition, (shown to be a tweet on the social media platform
6.           In August, 2020, the petitioner is stated to have been informed
by the police of Police Station DLF, Phase -V, Sector 43, Gurugram, that a
complaint had been filed against him on the basis of allegations of violations
of the provision of the Act, though a copy of the complaint is not stated to
have been provided to him.
On 17.08.2020, the petitioner is stated to have made a response
to the said complaint, after which, 'as per the petitioners' belief', the police at
Gurugram was satisfied with the response and consequently closed the case.
7.           On 15.02.2021, the petitioner is stated to have found out through
a newspaper article that the FIR presently in question had been registered at
Police Station Hansi, on 14.02.2021.
8.           It is next stated in the petition that a person by the name of Rajat
had approached the manager of the petitioner in June 2020 itself, to find a
means to “close the issue as per his requirements and demands”.
The petitioner however never paid any heed to the aforesaid
It is then contended that respondent no.2 has resorted to
therefore cause harm to the reputation and goodwill of the petitioner for
ulterior motives and by unlawful means, with the said respondent being an
9.           A reply to the petition was initially filed on behalf of the
respondent State by the Deputy Superintendent of Police, Hansi, dated
15.03.2021, in which it is stated that as per the complaint of respondent no.2,
the said respondent belongs to the Scheduled Caste community with the
petitioner belonging to the Jat Sikh community; and he by way of a live chat
on social medial had hurt the sentiments of the bhangi community, which is a
scheduled caste community and therefore he had tried to create hatred
amongst the two communities and to cause disharmony amongst them and
consequently, with the aforesaid complaint made to the Superintendent of
Police, Hansi, as also to the DGP, Haryana, an inquiry was marked to the
The compact disc (CD) in question (in which the video
conversation was recorded), was initially sent to the Cyber Police Station,
Panchkula and then to the Central Forensic Science Laboratory (CFSL),
Chandigarh, to determine its authenticity (on on 13.08.2020); and with the
objections initially raised by that laboratory having been removed, it was
again sent to the CFSL, after which the report of the CFSL, dated
28.09.2020, was to the effect that it was not the original video recording and
hence no opinion could be formed regarding its authenticity.
10.          Thereafter, the opinion of the Deputy District Attorney, Hansi,
was sought, who initially raised an issue of jurisdiction on the ground that
the address of the petitioner is of Manimajra, Chandigarh. Therefore, the
complaint was sent to the Chandigarh Police, which was returned on
10.02.2021, stating that the offence having been committed at Model Town,
Hansi, it would be the Hansi Police as would have jurisdiction to register and
investigate the case; and consequently upon approval of the SP, Hansi, the
FIR in question was registered (on 14.02.2021),
11.          The SP then constituted a Special Investigation Team (SIT) on
15.02.2021, “in terms of Rule 7 of the Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribes
(Prevention of Atrocities), Rules, 1995” (as stated in the SPs' affidavit), with
the said team headed by a DSP.
It has then been stated in the replyof the DSP that the
investigation being at its initial stage, with the offences committed by the
petitioner being cognizable in nature and non-bailable, the petitioner had
committed an offence against the State and he had also not joined
investigation of the case till that date (15.03.2021), and therefore quashing
the FIR at its initial stage would cause grave prejudice to the investigating
12.          The aforesaid being the preliminary submissions made by the
State, the reply on merits essentially reiterates the above.
13.          The matter thereafter having come up for hearing on 26.03.2021
before this court, other than some arguments raised on both sides (not of
much significance at that stage), it had been observed by this court that the
report of the CFSL, Chandigarh, was not understandable, in as much as the
doubt on the authenticity of the compact disc would seem to be misplaced
because the petitioner in any case was not denying having had the live chat
in question, as was recorded in that disc.
Consequently, the SP, Hansi, had been directed to file his own
affidavit, upon which an affidavit dated 23.04.02021 was filed by the SP, in
which essentially what had been already stated by the DSP was reiterated,
after which the contentions raised on behalf of the petitioner (as recorded in
the order of this court dated 23.02.2021), have been referred to, to state that
the petitioner was referring to the term 'bhangi' as a person in an inebriated
condition only to “save his skin from the clutches of law”.
14.          The SP next states in that affidavit that a local survey was
conducted by the investigating agency to find out the actual meaning of the
term 'Bhangi' as used in common parlance by people of reasonable prudence.
As per the SP, from such survey it was found that the said term
was used to denote a scheduled caste of the Balmiki Chura/Chure
communities and that in common parlance it is used as an abuse or in a
derogatory sense, by people belonging to not just the upper caste but even by
people of other backward classes, and that in common parlance it has not
been found that a person who consumes bhang (hemp), is called a bhangi,
with a person who consumes bhang usually referred to as nashedi .
Consequently, the investigating officer had at that stage added
an offence punishable under Section 3(1)(s) of the Act, as one of the offences
It has next been stated by the SP that the petitioner having
joined investigation, he could not produce any document to support that the
word 'bhangi' was used to refer to a person in an 'inebriated state'.
15.          The SP next goes on to state that it is the context of the usage of
the word that is to be seen and not just the word itself and therefore the
phrase 'ye bhangi logon ko koi kam nahi hai', shows that the petitioner had
used the word to encompass a whole community in an insulting and
humiliating way, on a social media platform, which, as per the SP, is a public
place within public view, for the purpose of interpretation of Section 3(1)(s)
of the Act.
16.          Next, the SP has stated in her affidavit dated 23.04.2021, that
the bhangi community has been listed as a scheduled caste community in the
official gazettes issued by the Governments of Punjab, Haryana, Delhi and
Himachal Pradesh etc. and that the petitioner being a resident of Chandigarh,
would be very well aware of the said fact, that the term is always used in an
abusive and a derogatory sense and consequently the interpretation being
given by him is not in the context of a person who consumes bhang .
Hence, it is stated that the term was used in a derogatory sense,
which resulted in humiliation of those belonging to the said caste and
consequently, the petitioner is liable to be prosecuted, with enough evidence
having been gathered during the investigation, that he had committed the
offences in question.
17.          Upon the aforesaid affidavit of the SP having been filed, learned
State counsel had submitted before this court on 28.04.2021, that in terms of
the judgment of the Supreme Court in M/s Neeharika Infrastructure Pvt.
Ltd. vs. State of Maharashtra and others, AIR 2021 SC 1918, the interim
order passed by this court on 25.02.2021, directing that investigation may
continue but no coercive steps be taken against the petitioner, would not be
an order that would be sustainable any longer on the touchstone of the ratio
of the said judgment, which was pronounced on 13.03.2021 by the Supreme
However, upon query by this court he had sought time to take
instructions as to whether petitioners' custodial interrogation was required or
18.          Learned counsel for the petitioner had on the other hand relied
upon a judgment of the Supreme Court in Ajay Mitra vs. State of MP and
others, 2003 (1) RCR (Crl.) 674, submitting that the said judgment was to
the contrary.
On 06.09.2021, learned State counsel had submitted that the
petitioner had given a mobile phone to the DSP, with this court therefore
having directed the DSP to file a short affidavit as to whether the phone
actually contained the video clip containing the allegedly derogatory
19.          Thereafter, on 15.09.02021, with learned senior counsel
appearing for the petitioner having wished to address arguments in detail and
counsel for the State having cited yet another judgment of the Supreme Court
in Salimbhai Hamidbhai Menon vs. Niteshkumar Mangalbhai Patel and
another 2021 SCC Online (SC) 647, this court had directed the SP to file an
affidavit as to whether any coercive steps were required to be taken against
the petitioner for any reasons, with the interim order directing that no
coercive steps be taken against him however continued at that stage.
20.           On 06.10.2021, other than recording some arguments raised by
senior counsel for the petitioner, this court had directed that in terms of the
judgment of the Supreme Court in Niharikas' case, the interim order passed
on 28.02.2021 stood modified to the effect that upon the petitioner joining
investigation with the investigating officer, he would be released on interim
bail upon him furnishing adequate bail and surety bonds till the next date of
hearing at that stage, with it also noticed that as per the affidavit filed by the
SP, dated 30.09.2021, it has been stated that the petitioners' physical
presence was required for effecting his 'formal arrest' in terms of Section 18-
A (b) of the Act.
Consequently, it had been observed by this court that since only
the formal arrest of the petitioner was required, he would be released on bail
upon joining investigation, but that if the SP had anything further to say on
the issue of the “formal arrest”, she would file another affidavit clarifying the
said term.
21.           On 18.11.2021, learned State counsel had stated before this
court that, as per his instructions from the DSP, Hansi, the petitioner having
joined investigation, his custodial interrogation was not required.
22.           Coming then to the reply filed by the complainant in the FIR, i.e.
respondent no.2, Rajat Kalsan, it is stated in the preliminary submissions that
the complaint was filed by him upon him having seen the video clip in
question, with that clip also having been seen by a very large number of
persons on the 'Instagram Live Chat', as the petitioner has about 20 million
followers on the said social media platform.
Thus, it is contended that the word bhangi, as used by the
petitioner, is a pejorative, which is in violation of the provisions of the Act.
In that context he has referred to a judgment of the Supreme
Court in Manju Devi vs. Onkarjit Singh Ahluwalia, (2017) 13 SCC 439,
reproducing paragraph 14 thereof, which reads as follows:-
“14. In the above context, it is now easy to understand the
factual matrix of the case. The use of the word `Harijan' `Dhobi'
etc. is often used by people belonging to the so-called upper
castes as a word of insult, abuse and derision. Calling a person
by these names is nowadays an abusive language and is
offensive. It is basically used nowadays not to denote a caste but
to intentionally insult and humiliate someone. We, as a citizen
of this country, should always keep one thing in our mind and
heart that no people or community should be today insulted or
looked down upon, and nobody's feelings should be hurt.”.
He next quotes from another judgment of the Supreme Court in
Amish Devgan vs. Union of India, (2021) 1 SCC 1, wherein it was
observed that persons of influence, in view of the reach and impact that they
have on the general public, are expected to know and perceive the meaning
conveyed by the words spoken or written by them.
Hence, respondent no.2/complainant has stated that the
petitioner being a famous cricketer, loved by millions, having used the said
word “bhangi”, has insulted whole dalit community.
23.           In the reply on merits, other than repeating the aforesaid
essential contentions, the complainant/respondent no.2 has referred to the
Constitution (Scheduled Caste) Orders (Amendment) Bill, 2016, to contend
that the said word, alongwith other words describing particular castes, was
sought to be replaced as they are used in a derogatory/abusive manner.
The complainant next states that even in (the latter part of) his
statement of apology, the petitioner simply stated as follows:
“I understand that while I was having a conversation
with my friends, I was misunderstood, which was
unwarranted. However, as a responsible Indian I want to
say that if I have unintentionally hurt anybody's sentiments
or feelings, I would like to express regret for the same.”
Hence, it is contended that even from the said statement it is
obvious that the petitioner is not admitting that he had used the word as a
pejorative and thus insulted the whole dalit community.
24.           As regards the allegation of the petitioner that one Rajat
contacted the manager of the petitioner to “close the issue”, the complainant
states that the photograph annexed with the chat of the person allegedly
referred    to    as   Rajat,   is   not      of    any   relation/acquaintance of
complainant/respondent no.2 and therefore the allegation is wholly
misplaced, with the complainant being an Advocate and a social activist who
is fighting against injustices against the dalit community and that it would be
wrong to presume that if any member of the dalit community fights back
against an insult on that community, the only motive for that would be to
gain some monetary benefits.
In that context respondent no.2 refers to the judgment of the
Supreme Court in Union of India vs. State of Maharashtra, 2020 (4) SCC
761, wherein it was observed that there can be no presumption that any
member of the scheduled caste and                scheduled tribe    may misuse the
provisions of law “as a class” (as already reproduced earlier in para 2
25.          Respondent no.2 next refers         to the Constitution (Scheduled
Castes) Order, 1950, to contend that the word bhangi refers to a scheduled
caste notified by various states in the country.
26.          All in all, those are the contentions raised by the respondent in
his reply, with him of course having refuted the applicability of the
judgments cited by learned counsel for the petitioner in his petition, in the
context of the present case.
27.          Coming then to the argument addressed by learned counsel
appearing of the parties.
Learned senior counsel appearing for the petitioner, other than
reiterating what has already been reproduced from the order of this court
dated 25.02.2021, (reference para 2 of this judgment), first referred to
Section 2 (ec) of the Act, which defines the word 'victim' as follows:-
“(ec) “victim” means any individual who falls within the
definition of the “Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes”
under clause (c) of sub-section (1) of Section 2, and who has
suffered or experienced physical, mental, psychological,
emotional or monetary harm or harm to his property as a result
of the commission of any offence under this Act and includes
his relatives, legal guardian and legal heirs.”
His contention therefore is that the complainant neither having
suffered any physical, mental, psychological, emotional or monetary harm
himself, nor being a relative, legal guardian etc. of any victim, the FIR is not
maintainable on that ground alone.
Learned senior counsel further submitted that though the
complainant-respondent no.2 claims to be a social activist in the cause of
members of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes, however a perusal
of the screen-shot of 'Whatsapp' messages and the table of complaints made
by him (Annexures P-4 and P-8 with the petition, respectively), would show
that he is a habitual complainant engaged in filing false and fictitious
complaints against prominent people for publicity and is also an extortionist.
He further contended that in fact the complaint made at
Gurugram on 05.08.2020 (referred to earlier, supra), was through another aid
of his only to harass and extort money from the petitioner, with the police at
Gurugram having filed away that complaint, to the best knowledge of the
Learned senior counsel next referred to an order of this court
(co-ordinate Bench) dated 12.10.2021, passed in CRM-M-42685 of 2021
(Bhagwant Singh Randhawa and another v. State of Punjab), issuing a
direction to all Senior Superintendents of Police, that before registering any
FIR under the Act, a legal opinion should be taken from the District Attorney
as to whether the complainant falls within the definition of “victim” or not,
with in fact that direction having been given in the context of “so-called
social activists”.
28.           Learned senior counsel next reiterated that there is no
jurisdiction with the District Police, Hansi, to register the FIR as the
petitioner was in Mumbai at the time that the words in question were said by
him on social media and the person to whom they were being spoken, i.e.
Rohit Sharma, was also not in Hansi at that time and in fact the person about
whom they were spoken (Yuzvender Chahal) wasalso not in Hansi.
29.           Mr. Bali, learned senior counsel time and again reiterated and
emphasized that the word bhangi was used by the petitioner in the context of
an inebriated person who consumes bhang (hemp) and not in the context of
any caste or community and consequently, the question of any offence
having been committed under the provisions of the Act, does not arise in the
first place and the entire FIR is misconceived.
He further submitted in that context that since the word was
used in the context of Yuzvender Chahal who does not belong to a scheduled
caste, and was making his father dance at a wedding ceremony, it is very
obvious that the word was used in that context only (of an intoxicated
He next referred to the meaning of the word bhangi as is stated
to be used in the Merriam Webster dictionary as also the Collins English
Dictionary, wherein the word (though a Hindi word), has been translated in
various forms including in the context of a person using bhang (hemp),
alongwith its translation in the latter dictionary as a reference to a member of
a caste of persons traditionally assigned the work of sweeping.
Mr. Bali also submitted that a search on the internet, of the said
word, also gives the aforesaid two meanings.
Thus, the contention of learned senior counsel is that looking at
the context in which the word was used, at a marriage ceremony of persons
not belonging to the scheduled castes, it can only have been used in the
context of a person who was in an intoxicated state.
Learned senior counsel for the petitioner next submitted that
further, the aforesaid act of the petitioner, in using the said word/phrase does
not fall within the purview of Sections 153-A and 153-B of the IPC in any
He also submitted that during the course of oral arguments,
learned counsel for respondent no.2 had in fact conceded before this court
that he was not pressing the offence punishable under the aforesaid
provisions of the IPC and with in any case, no mens rea attributable to the
petitioner in the context of those provisions, the FIR is completely
unsustainable even in that context.
Mr. Bali, in that context, relied upon a judgment of the Supreme
Court in Balwant Singh v. State of Punjab (1995) 3 SCC 214, wherein it
“In so far as the offence under Section 153-A of the IPC is
concerned, it provides for punishment for promoting enmity
between different groups on grounds of religion, race, place of
birth, residence, language, caste or community or any other
ground whatsoever or brings about disharmony or feeling of
hatred or ill-will between different religious, racial, language or
regional groups or castes or communities. In our opinion only
where the written or spoken words have the tendency or
intention of creating public disorder or disturbance of law and
order or effect public tranquility, that the law needs to step in to
prevent such an activity. The facts and circumstances of this
case unmistakably show that there was no disturbance or
semblance of disturbance of law and order or of public order or
peace and tranquility in the area from where the appellants were
apprehended while raising slogans on account of the activities of
the appellants. The intention to cause disorder or incite people to
violence is the since qua non of the offence under Section 153 A
IPC and the prosecution has to prove the existence of mens rea
in order to succeed. In this case, the prosecution has not been
able to establish any mens rea on the part of the appellants, as
envisaged by the provisions of Section 153 A IPC, by their
raising casually the three slogans a couple of times. The offence
under Sectio9n 153A IPC is, therefore, not made out.”
Learned senior counsel submitted that the said opinion of the
Supreme Court having been made in the context of a person who was raising
slogans amounting to secessionism, the offence under Section 153-A in any
case cannot apply to the utterance of the petitioner.
In the same context, he also referred to another judgment of the
Supreme Court, in Manzar Sayeed Khan v. State of Maharashtra and
another (2007) 5 SCC 1, wherein it was held as follows:-
“Section 153A of the IPC, as extracted hereinabove, covers a
case where a person by words, either spoken or written, or by
signs or by visible representations or otherwise, promotes or
attempts to promote, disharmony or feelings of enmity, hatred or
ill-will between different religious, racial, language or regional
groups or castes or communities or acts prejudicial to the
maintenance of harmony or is likely to disturb the public
tranquility. The gist of the offence is the intention to promote
feelings of enmity or hatred between different classes of people.
The intention to cause disorder or incite the people to violence
is the sine qua non of the offence under Section 153A of the IPC
and the prosecution has to prove prima facie the existence of
mens rea on the part of the accused. The intention has to be
judged primarily by the language of the book and the
circumstances in which the book was written and published. The
matter complained of within the ambit of Section 153A must be
read as a whole. One cannot rely on strongly worded and
isolated passages for proving the charge nor indeed can one take
a sentence here and a sentence there and connect them by a
meticulous process of inferential reasoning.”
Learned senior counsel submitted that therefore the offence
punishable under Section 153-B of the IPC would also not be made out at all.
30.           Coming then to the offences punishable under the Act, as the
petitioner is alleged to have committed, i.e. under Section 3(1)(u) thereof, as
also clause (s) of the said provision, learned senior counsel submitted that
since the petitioner had not uttered the words with any intention of
promoting feelings of any enmity, hatred or ill-will against any member of
the scheduled castes or scheduled tribes, Section 3(1)(u) would not be
attracted at all; and as regards the contention of respondent no.2 that the act
being a beneficial piece of legislation mens rea is not required for the
applicability of the said offence, as per learned senior counsel, merely
because a legislation is for the welfare of any class of people, or even to
eradicate social evils, mens rea cannot be deemed to have been 'waived off'.
Hence, he submitted that if there is no intention to cause any
kind of hurt to any person by the utterance of any such words, that no offence
at all would be made out.
In that context, he relied upon a judgment of the Supreme Court
in State of Maharashtra v. Mayer Hans George AIR 1965 722, from
which he pointed to the following part of the judgment:-
“To put it differently, there is a presumption that mens rea is an
essential ingredient of a statutory offence; but this may be
rebutted by the express words of a statute creating the offence or
by necessary implication. But the mere fact that the object of a
statute is to promote welfare activities or to eradicate grave
social evils is in itself not decisive of the question whether the
element of guilty mind is excluded from the ingredients of the
offence.”
31.            Learned senior counsel next submitted that with the language
used in Section 3(1)(u) of the Act being almost identical to the language of
Section 153-A of the IPC, inasmuch as both refer to an intention of
promoting or attempting to promote feelings of ill-will etc. on grounds of
religion, caste etc., the ratio of the judgments in Balwant Singh and Manzar
Sayeed Khans' cases (both supra) would apply even to the provisions of the
32.          Mr. Bali next submitted that the words used by the petitioner not
having resulted in any consequential action against any member of the
Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes, with no disturbances in law and
order or peace and tranquility having been reported in that context, the
provisions of the Act would in any case not apply, with the intention not
being to use the phrase in any derogatory manner against any person of a
particular caste or tribe.
33.          Learned senior counsel next referred to an order/judgment of the
Supreme Court in R.S. Bharathi v. State (2021) SCC Online SC 535, to
submit that even a charge sheet filed against a political leader, alleging
therein the commission of an offence punishable under Section 3(1)(u) of the
Act, was quashed on the ground that the said provision was not attracted as
the speech made by the said leader did not promote or attempt to promote
feelings of enmity, hatred or ill-will against members of a Scheduled Caste or
34.           Referring to the judgment of the Supreme Court in Union of
India v. State of Maharashtra (supra), as has been relied upon by respondent
no.2, learned senior counsel for the petitioner submitted that even in the said
judgment itself, it has been held that where certain cases may have been
falsely instituted, even in the context of the Act, such situations can be taken
care of in proceedings under Section 482 of the Cr.P.C. and therefore the
present petition is very much maintainable, contrary to what counsel for
respondent no.2 submitted before this court on the date that notice of motion
itself was issued.
In that regard, he pointed to the following part of the said
“52. There is no presumption that the members of the
Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes may misuse the
provisions of law as a class and it is not resorted to by the
members of the upper Castes or the members of the elite class.
For lodging a false report, it cannot be said that the caste of a
person is the cause. It is due to the human failing and not due to
the caste factor. Caste is not attributable to such an act. On the
other hand, members of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled
Tribes due to backwardness hardly muster the courage to lodge
even a first information report, much less, a false one. In case it
is found to be false/unsubstantiated, it may be due to the faulty
investigation or for other various reasons including human
failings irrespective of caste factor. There may be certain cases
which may be false that can be a ground for interference by the
Court, but the law cannot be changed due to such misuse. In
such a situation, it can be taken care in proceeding under Section
482 of the Cr.P.C.
60.    In case any person apprehends that he may be arrested,
harassed and implicated falsely, he can approach the High Court
for quashing the FIR under Section 482 as observed in State of
Orissa v. Debendra Nath Padhi (2005) 1 SCC 568.”
35.           Next, Mr. Bali submitted that the petitioner being a responsible
citizen, who realises that unfortunately his statement was misunderstood, he
immediately released a public statement apologizing to the entire country and
conveying his true intention.
He further submitted that the petitioner had spent his entire life
for the welfare of the people, with him also having done tremendous
charitable work, including setting up of 800 ICU beds in different parts of
the country over the past few months, including in Haryana, with him also
having sponsored the cancer treatment of 85 underprivileged children in the
past two years, with him also having sponsored cancer screening of more
than 1.5 lakh people over the past 4 years.
Finally, learned senior counsel submitted that the petitioner
having learnt from the unfortunate incident, he undertakes to further the
cause of the “respectable Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes
Community” in any manner that this court may direct and consequently, with
the Supreme Court also having held that in appropriate cases this court would
exercise jurisdiction under Section 482 of the Cr.P.C. to quash any false FIR
registered, the FIR in question deserves to be quashed.
36.           In reply to the aforesaid contentions raised by learned senior
counsel for the petitioner, Mr. Arjun Sheoran, learned counsel appearing for
the complainant-respondent no.2, submitted that as regards the issue of the
complainant not having any locus standi to file the complaint in question, he
being a member of a scheduled caste community, he is himself a victim of the
“atrocity” committed by the petitioner under Section 3(1)(u) of the Act, he
having suffered mental, psychological and emotional harm and with him
therefore being a victim even in terms of Section 2(ec) thereof.
Mr. Sheoran further submitted that any person who has
knowledge about the commission of an offence can file a complaint/an FIR
as an informant, as per well settled law.
37.          As regards the contention on behalf of the petitioner that the
District Police, Hansi, has no jurisdiction to register the FIR, Mr. Sheoran
submitted that the words in question having been used on the social media
platform, Instagram, with the video seen by the said respondent in Hansi and
by millions of people across the country and even abroad, the question of the
Hansi police not having jurisdiction, would not arise.
In that context, he relied upon a judgment of the Supreme Court
in Amish Devgan (supra), wherein it was held as follows:-
“16. We reject the contention of the petitioner that criminal
proceedings arising from the impugned FIRs ought to be
quashed as these FIR were registered in places where no “cause
of action” arose. Section 179 of the Criminal Procedure Code
provides that an offence is triable at the place where an act is
done or its consequence ensues. It provides:
179. Offence triable where act is done or consequence
ensues.- When an act is an offence by reason of anything which
has bene done and of a consequence which has ensued, the
offence may be inquired into or tried by a court within whose
local jurisdiction such thing has been done or such consequence
has ensued.”
37.          As regards the complaint lodged at Gurugram (on 05.08.2020),
learned counsel submitted that respondent no.2 categorically again states that
he does not know the person who had filed that complaint.
38.          As regards the petitioner having used the word bhangi in the
context of an inebriated person, learned counsel for respondent no.2 again
reiterated that the said contention is completely an after-thought, with the
petitioner neither having stated so in his petition, nor even in the apology
that he tendered in June 2020.
Mr. Sheoran therefore submitted that if indeed the word had
been used in that context, that would have been the first thing that the
petitioner would have stated in his apology and consequently the argument
being raised time and again to that effect before this court by learned senior
counsel for the petitioner, is wholly an after-thought and an ingenious
addition to the written submissions made.
In that context, learned counsel further submitted that even as
per the affidavit filed by the SSP, Hansi, the said word is used in the
Northern India, in common parlance, as a derogatory reference to a person
belonging to a Scheduled Caste and is not used in the context of a person
who is intoxicated, with the word used in the latter context being Nasherdi.
In support of that argument, learned counsel for respondent no.2
relied upon a judgment of the Supreme Court in Swaran Singh v. State
(2008) 8 SCC 435, wherein it was observed as follows:-
“22. It may be mentioned that when we interpret Section
3(1)(x) of the Act we have to see the purpose for which the Act
was enacted. It was obviously made to prevent indignities,
humiliation and harassment to the members of SC/ST
community, as is evident from the statement of objects and
reasons of the Act. Hence, while interpreting Section 3(1)(x) of
the Act, we have to take into account the popular meaning of the
word “chamar” which it has acquired by usage, and not the
etymological meaning. If we go by the etymological meaning,
we may frustrate the very object of the Act, and hence that
would not be a correct manner of interpretation.”
39.           As regards whether or not any offence punishable under the
provisions of Sections 153-A and 153-B of the IPC are made out or not, Mr.
Sheoran submitted that the investigation still not being complete, whether or
not there was any mens rea in the context of the said offences, would be a
matter to be determined by the investigating agency, with the SPs' affidavit
being to the effect that a prima facie case is made out against the petitioner.
40.           In the context of the offence punishable under Section 3(1)(u) of
the Act, learned counsel for respondent no.2 submitted that the word bhangi
has been used in a derogatory manner by the petitioner in the conversation in
question and therefore is derogatory to the entire Scheduled Castes
community, thereby bringing his action within the purview of the said
Learned counsel submitted that a perusal of the Statement of
Objects and Reasons of the Amendment Act of 2016, by which Section 3
was amended, shows that the said provision was added to specifically deal
with certain forms of atrocities on Scheduled Castes, as had been occruing in
recent years.
He submitted that wherever the word “intention” is a pre-
requisite as regards the commission of any atrocity/offence under the Act, the
said word (“intention/intentionally”) is specifically mentioned, such as in
clauses (c), (r), (w) (i) of sub-section (1) of Section 3, as also in sub-section
(2) of Section 3.
However, there is no mention of that word (“intention”), or of
the word “knowledge”, in Section 3(1)(u) of the Act and consequently, he
contended that no specific intention is required to be proved as regards the
commission of any offence punishable under the said provision.
41.           Mr. Sheoran next submitted that in fact offences punishable
under Section 3 of the Act are defined as an “atrocity” in Section 2(1)(a)
thereof and in fact there is no requirement of any sanction for invoking the
said provision, unlike a sanction required in the context of an offence
punishable under Section 153-A of the IPC.
He further submitted in that context that in fact there is no need
of any two communities being involved to invoke the provisions of Section
3(1)(u) as the said provision was inserted in the Act to specifically deal with
such atrocities.
42.           Learned counsel for respondent no.2 next referred to an order of
the Supreme Court in Munmun Dutta v. State of Haryana WP(Crl.) no.241
of 2021, to submit that in similar circumstances it was held that the petitioner
therein could not take advantage of the judgment in the case of R.S. Bharathi
(supra), with the Supreme Court therefore having denied the relief of
quashing the FIR to that petitioner.
43.           As regards the apology tendered by the petitioner in June 2020,
learned counsel for respondent no.2 submitted that the said apology came
only as an after-thought about 1½ to 2 months after the words were uttered,
and after the FIR had been already registered.
He next submitted in that context that even in Amish Devgans'
case (supra), the Supreme Court had refused to quash the FIR in question
there, solely on the basis of any apology issued by the accused.
44.           As regards the judgment cited on behalf of the petitioner in
Subhash Kashinath Mahajan v. State of Maharashtra 2018 (6) SCC 454,
Mr. Sheoran reiterated that the said judgment has been reviewed by the
Supreme Court in Union of India v. State of Maharashtra (supra), holding as
“68. The direction has also been issued that the DSP should
conduct a preliminary inquiry to find out whether the allegations
make out a case under the Atrocities Act, and that the
allegations are not frivolous or motivated. In case a cognizable
offence is made out, the FIR has to be outrightly registered, and
no preliminary inquiry has to be made as held in Lalita Kumari
[Lalita Kumar v. Stae of U.P. (2014) 2 SCC 1: (2014) 1 SCC
(Cri) 524] by a Constitution Bench. There is no such provision
in the Code of Criminal Procedure for preliminary inquiry or
under the SC/ST Act, as such direction is impermissible.
Moreover, it is ordered to be conducted by the person of the
rank of DSP.....”
45.          Last, learned counsel for respondent no.2 submitted that as held
in Neeharikas' case (supra), there are specific guidelines laid down for
quashing of an FIR by invoking jurisdiction under Section 482 of the Cr.P.C.
and, as he submits, the present case is not one which would fall within the
ambit of such guidelines to quash the FIR, the petitioner in any case not
having denied uttering the words in question.
Consequently, he submitted that the petition deserves to be
46.          Mr. Neeraj Poswal, learned AAG, Haryana, other than
reiterating what has been stated by learned counsel for respondent no.2,
specifically relied upon the affidavit of the SP, Hansi, as also the first
affidavit of the DSP, to submit that the District Police having found that a
case is made out against the petitioner, prima facie, with the matter still
being under investigation, there would be no ground whatsoever to quash the
FIR, even in terms of the ratio of the judgment in Neeharikas' case.
Learned State counsel also relied upon the following judgments
i)    Jitual Jentilal Kotecha v. State of Gujarat and others
2021 SCC Online SC 1045 and
ii)   Kaushik Chatterjee v. State of Haryana and others
(CRM-M no.13690 of 2019, decided on 29.05.2019 by a
co-ordinate Bench of this court).
47.          Having considered the matter, first of course the preliminary
issue raised by the petitioner as regards the District Police, Hansi, not having
any jurisdiction to register the FIR, needs to be considered.
As noticed, the contention in that regard is that the petitioner
having uttered the words in question during a conversation that he was
holding while he was in Mumbai and the person with whom he was holding
the conversation (Rohit Sharma) also not being present at Hansi at that time,
the complainant, who is a resident of Hansi, could not have registered a
complaint there.
That contention has to be rejected in my opinion, in view of the
fact that admittedly the conversation between the petitioner and Rohit
Sharma, was via a social media application (Instagram), and as per learned
counsel for the complainant-respondent no.2, it could have been viewed
anywhere across the world and consequently, whoever was watching such
live Instagram chat, no matter at what place such person was located at that
time, would have a right to institute a complaint if aggrieved by any part of
such conversation/chat, he/she obviously having heard it at the place where
such person was located.
In that context, the judgment cited by Mr. Sheoran, in Amish
Devgans' case (supra), needs to be referred to.
In that case, there was a TV programme in which certain offensive
words were alleged to have been said by the petitioner before the Supreme Court,
while hosting a TV show and in that context it was held as follows:-
“A.      First Prayer – Whether the FIRs should be quashed?
16. We reject the contention of the petitioner that criminal
proceedings arising from the impugned FIRs ought to be quashed as
these FIRs were registered in places where no “cause of action” arose.
Section 179 of the Criminal Procedure Code provides that an offence
is triable at the place where an act is done or its consequence ensues.
“179. Offence triable where act is done or consequence
ensues.-- When an act is an offence by reason of anything which
has been done and of a consequence which has ensued, the
offence may be inquired into or tried by a court within whose
local jurisdiction such thing has been done or such consequence
has ensued.”
17. The debate-show hosted by the petitioner was broadcast on a
widely viewed television network. The audience, including the
complainants, were located in different parts of India and were
affected by the utterances of the petitioner; thus, the consequence of
the words of the petitioner ensued in different places, including the
places of registration of the impugned FIRs.
18. Further, sub-section (1) of Section 156 of the Criminal
Procedure Code provides that any officer in charge of a police station
may investigate any cognizable case which a court having jurisdiction
over the local limits of such station would have the power to inquire
into or try. Thus, a conjoint reading of Sections 179 and 156(1) of the
Criminal Procedure Code make it clear that the impugned FIRs do not
suffer from this jurisdictional defect.”
Consequently, it is held that the FIR has not been registered by the
District Police, Hansi, without jurisdiction, and that in the circumstances, the local
police has jurisdiction to do so.
It is also to be of course noticed that even if the petitioner did not see
the video clip exactly at the same time as the petitioner was making the statement in
question, but subsequently saw it after it had become 'viral' on social media, in my
opinion the cause of action would still arise at the place where it was viewed, it
having been admitted that the utterance was actually made not by way of a private
conversation between two persons but on a live chat on social media.
48.           As regards the complainant not having any locus standi to file the
complaint, I do not agree with the contentions raised by learned senior counsel for
the petitioner in that regard either because it is not denied anywhere that the
complainant-respondent no.2 belongs to a Scheduled Caste and consequently if,
upon viewing the video clip in question, he felt aggrieved of the word used, as a
member of a Scheduled Caste (whether or not belonging to the caste referred to as
bhangi), he would be a victim in the opinion of this court, even in terms of Section
2(ec) of the Act, as has been referred to by learned senior counsel for the petitioner
and has been reproduced in paragraph 27 hereinabove.
As per the definition in the said clause, a victim means any individual
who belongs to a Scheduled Caste or Scheduled Tribe and who suffers or
experiences physical, mental, psychological, emotional or monetary harm or harm
to his property, as a result of the commission of any offence punishable under the
Thus, if respondent no.2, belonging to a Scheduled Caste, felt
mentally, emotionally or psychologically hurt by the usage of the phrase and word
in question, this court would not hold that he is not a victim who would not have
locus standi to file a complaint in that regard.
Thus, it is held that he would fall within the definition of victim as
defined in the aforesaid provision.
49.           Of course, the contention made on behalf of the petitioner that
respondent no.2 is a habitual complainant and engages in filing false and fictitious
complaints against prominent people for publicity, is not something that this court
would comment on at this stage, with the matter still stated to be under
investigation, but even if it is presumed for the sake of argument that he does file
such complaints only against such celebrities, and possibly may be doing so for
publicity also, that still would not change the fact that being a member of a
Scheduled Caste, he may have been hurt emotionally/psychologically/mentally, on
hearing a word pertaining to a particular caste, used in a derogatory manner.
50.           As regards the contention on behalf of the petitioner that this court
vide its order dated 12.10.2021, passed in Bhagwant Singh Randhawas' case
(supra), directed all Senior Superintendents of Police (in Punjab) that an
opinion should be taken from the District Attorney as to whether a
complainant falls within the definition of a victim, other than the fact that I
may have reservations (with all due respect) on that direction, yet, this court
itself having gone into that issue hereinabove, of whether or not respondent
no.2 can be a victim, and having held that he would fall within that
definition, and further more, even the SP, Hansi and the DSP, in their
affidavits, have stated that the opinion of the District Attorney was taken
(though not specifically with regard to whether the complainant would
actually fall within the said definition or not), that argument is also rejected.
51.           The next contention of learned senior counsel for the petitioner,
on which he very vehemently argued time and again, is to the effect that the
word used by the petitioner was in the context of an inebriated person.
First of course this court has to notice that (as has been pointed
out by learned counsel for respondent no.2), neither in his public apology
made on June 05, 2020 (Annexure P-1 with the petition), did the petitioner
say anything even remotely to that effect, nor in fact has he even stated that
anywhere in the petition, with that contention having been first raised before
this court in oral arguments (though subsequently stated in the rejoinder filed
by the petitioner, to the replies filed by the respondents).
Further, as per the affidavit of the SP, Hansi, the word that is
normally used in this part of the country to refer to a person in an inebriated
state, is Nasherdi, and with the word bhangi is actually used in reference to a
particular community notified to be a Scheduled Caste in all States of
Northern India at least (and also in various other States across the country as
per the reply of respondent no.2).
In that context, the judgment relied upon by learned counsel for
respondent no.2, in Swaran Singhs' case (supra), can also be referred to
wherein their Lordships held that:-
“22.       It may be mentioned that when we interpret Section
3(1)(x) of the Act we have to see the purpose for which the Act
was enacted. It was obviously made to prevent indignities,
humiliation and harassment to the members of SC/ST
community, as is evident from the statement of objects and
reasons of the Act. Hence, while interpreting Section 3(1)(x) of
the Act, we have to take into account the popular meaning of the
word “chamar” which it has acquired by usage, and not the
etymological meaning. If we go by the etymological meaning,
we may frustrate the very object of the Act, and hence that
would not be a correct manner of interpretation.”
Thus, in the opinion of this court what would hold good in the context
of Section 3(1)(x) of the Act, would also hold equally good for any offences
punishable under Sections 3(1)(u) and 3(1)(s).
Yet, this court would obviously not make any final comment in that
regard and would leave it to the investigating agency to come to its own final
conclusion after the investigation is complete. In fact, even this comment may not
have been made by this court, looking at the stage of the investigation, but was
needed to be made, as one of the prime contentions raised on behalf of the
petitioner in this petition seeking quashing of the FIR, is to that effect.
52.            Coming next to the contention that the word that the petitioner uttered
would not amount to the commission of an offence punishable either under Section
153-A, or 153-B of the IPC.
In that context, the said provisions are reproduced hereinbelow:-
“153A. Promoting enmity between different groups on
ground of religion, race, place of birth, residence, language,
etc., and doing acts prejudicial to maintenance of harmony.--
(a) by words, either spoken or written, or by signs or by
visible representations or otherwise, promotes or attempts to
promote, on grounds of religion, race, place of birth,
residence, language, caste or community or any other ground
whatsoever, disharmony or feelings of enmity, hatred or
illwill between different religious, racials, language or
regional groups or castes or communities, or
(b) commits any act which is prejudicial to the maintenance
of harmony between different religious, racial, language or
regional groups or castes or communities, and which
disturbs or is likely to disturb the public tranquillity,[or]
(c) organizes any exercise, movement, drill or other similar
activity intending that the participants in such activity shall
use or be trained to use criminal force or violence or
knowing it to be likely that the participants in such activity
will use or be trained to use criminal force or violence, or
participates in such activity intending to use or be trained to
use criminal force or violence or knowing it to be likely that
the participants in such activity will use or be trained to use
criminal force or violence, against any religious, racial,
language or regional group or caste or community and such
activity for any reason whatsoever causes or is likely to
cause fear or alarm or a feeling of insecurity amongst
members of such religious, racial, language or regional
group or caste or community, shall be punished with
imprisonment which may extend to three years, or with fine,
or with both.
(2) Offence committed in place of worship, etc.--Whoever
commits an offence specified in sub-section (1) in any place of
worship or in any assembly engaged in the performance of
religious worship or religious ceremonies, shall be punished
with imprisonment which may extend to five years and shall
also be liable to fine.
153B. Imputations, assertions prejudicial to national-
integration.
(1)Whoever, by words either spoken or written or by signs or by
visible representations or otherwise,—
(a)makes or publishes any imputation that any class of
persons cannot, by reason of their being members of any
religious, racial, language or regional group or caste or
community, bear true faith and allegiance to the
Constitution of India as by law established or uphold the
sovereignty and integrity of India, or
(b)asserts, counsels, advises, propagates or publishes that
any class of persons shall, by reason of their being
members of any religious, racial, language or regional
group or caste or commnity, be denied or deprived of their
rights as citizens of India, or
(c)makes or publishes any assertion, counsel, plea or
appeal concerning the obligation of any class of persons,
by reason of their being members of any religious, racial,
language or regional group or caste or community, and
such assertion, counsel, plea or appeal causes or is likely
to cause disharmony or feelings of enmity or hatred or ill-
will between such members and other persons, shall be
punished with imprisonment which may extend to three
years, or with fine, or with both.
(2)Whoever commits an offence specified in sub-section (1), in
any place of worship or in any assembly engaged in the
performance of religious worship or religious ceremonies, shall
be punished with imprisonment which may extend to five years
and shall also be liable to fine.”
53.           Looking first at Section 153-A in detail, in my opinion though the act
of the petitioner in using the phrase and word in question would not fall either
under clause (c) of sub-section (1) (and definitely would not fall under sub-section
(2)), yet, whether or not it falls within the ambit of clause (b) of sub-section (1),
would otherwise be something that the investigating agency would have perhaps
needed to look into in detail and then come to its own finding thereupon,but for the
fact that learned counsel has cited a judgment of the Supreme Court in Balwant
Singhs' case (supra).
As regards the observation made hereinabove on the said phrase/word
not falling within the ambit of clause (c), very obviously the petitioner was not
organizing any activity intending that the participants therein would use or be
trained to use criminal force or violence etc. as is postulated in the said provision.
Though at first blush even clause (a) would not be attracted, however
what needs to be noticed is that the word used in the opening two lines of the said
clause is that a person who by even spoken word, “promotes or attempts to promote,
on grounds of ........... caste or community .......”.
Hence, whereas this court will hold even now at this stage that the
petitioner obviously did not attempt to promote or even also did not intend to
promote any disharmony by usage of the phrase looking at the context in which it
was used, but if it results in actually him promoting such disharmony or ill-will, it
may have been a moot point as to whether the offence came within the ambit of the
said provision. Yet, the Supreme Court having held in that case, where an obviously
separatist phrase was used by the accused therein, that it still was not a word which
had the tendency or intention of creating public dis-order or disturbance to law and
order, in the petitioners' case also it must be held by this court, on the touchstone of
the ratio of that judgment, that the said offence would not be made out despite what
is contained even in clause (a) and (b) of sub-section (1) thereof.
54.            Thus, the petitioner having used the particular word (bhangi) in the
context of a friend making his father dance, in my opinion an offence punishable
under Section 153-A of the IPC is not made out, there not being any intention to
promote any disharmony or feeling of enmity etc. between any two or more sections
of society as per the said judgment
That would be so even in terms of the ratio of the judgment in Manzar
Sayeed Khans' case (supra), wherein it was held that:-
“The intention to cause disorder or incite the people to violence is the
sine qua non of the offence under Section 153-A IPC and the
prosecution has to prove prima facie the existence of mens rea on the
part of the accused.” (Reference paragraph 16, SCC edition).
55.           Coming then to whether or not an offence punishable under Section
153-B of the IPC is even prima facie made out against the petitioner or not.
In the opinion of this court, even a bare reading of any of the clauses
in sub-section (1) of Section 153-B would not apply to the phrase or the word used
by the petitioner in any manner, because very obviously it was not his intention to
say either that any particular caste does not bear true faith and allegiance to the
Constitution of India or does not uphold the integrity of India; or that any member
of such particular caste or class should be denied or deprived of his/her right as a
citizen of India and further, neither did he make any assertion, council, plea or
appeal concerning the obligation of any class or caste so as to cause disharmony or
feelings of hatred or enmity or ill-will between any person.
56.           Thus, it is held that as regards the allegation that the petitioner
committed offences punishable under Sections 153-A and 153-B of the IPC, the one
falling under Section 153-B is prima facie also not made out and as regards Section
153-A, on the touchstone of the aforesaid judgments in Balwant Singhs' and
Manzar Sayeed Khans' cases (both supra), again no such offence would be made
57.            Coming then to the all important question of whether the phrase and
the word used by the petitioner would (prima facie) fall within the purview of either
Section 3(1)(s) or Section 3(1)(u) of the Act, or not.
For convenience, the said provisions are being reproduced here:-
“3. Punishments for offences of atrocities.- (1) Whoever, not
being a member of a Scheduled Caste or a Scheduled Tribe,-
(s)    abuses any member of a Scheduled Caste or a Scheduled Tribe by
caste name in any place within public view;
(u)    by words either written or spoken or by signs or by visible
representation or otherwise promotes or attempts to promote feelings of
enmity, hatred or ill-will against members of the Scheduled Castes or the
shall be punishable with imprisonment for a term which shall not
be less than six months but which may extend to five years and with
fine.”
58.            Though on the reasoning given hereinabove pertaining to Sections 153-
A and 153-B of the IPC, at first blush it would seem that no case would be made out
against the petitioner even prima facie under the said provisions also, with Section
3(1)(u) being otherwise very similarly worded as Sections 153-A(1)(a) of the IPC (and
as has been vehemently argued by learned senior counsel for the petitioner), however,
what this court obviously needs to consider is that the Act of 1989 is a special Act
enacted for the welfare of the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes with the
statement of the objects and reasons thereof reading as follows in its initial part itself:-
“Despite various measures to improve the socio-economic conditions of
the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes, they remain vulnerable.
They are denied number of civil rights. They are subjected to various
offences, indignities, humiliations and harassment. They have, in several
brutal incidents, been deprived of their life and property. Serious crimes
are committed against them for various historical, social and economic
reasons.”
After the Act was enacted in the year 1989, it has been extensively
amended in the year 2016, with such amendment including the definition of victim
as contained in clause (ec) of Section 2(1), as also by substituting the Section 3 and
bringing within its ambit a far larger number of acts/actions, to be classified as
Further, there would also be some substance in what Mr. Sheoran has
submitted in the context of the word “intention” have been used in clauses (c),(r),
(w)(i) of sub-section (1) of Section 3 of the Act, but the word (“intention”) not
having been used in clause (u) thereof.
However, that is something that the investigating agency would finally
determine with no further comment made on merits by this court.
59.            Though otherwise I would completely agree with learned senior
counsel for the petitioner that the petitioner did not intentionally mean to cause any
dis-respect or harm or even humiliation to any class of people, especially with him
not having uttered the word either in reference to a member of a Scheduled Caste
(the father of his friend not being a member of any Scheduled Caste), nor did he
address it specifically to any person who belongs to the Scheduled Caste, with the
person with whom he was having a chat (Rohit Sharma) also not being a member of
a Scheduled Caste; yet, as regards the contention raised by learned counsel for
respondent no.2, to the effect that the word has been used as a pejorative, i.e. has
been used derisively, or is used in the context of a person not being held in good
esteem, prima facie at least I would agree with him, especially with the
Superintendent of Police also having stated in her affidavit (dated 23.04.2021) that
the said word (bhangi) is used in the Northern India normally in the context of a
particular class/caste, in a derogatory sense.
In that context, it also needs to be stated here that in common parlance
many words are used in a derogatory sense even though the actual meaning of the
word would actually be a reference to either a relationship or would be in reference
to a particular caste/class of a person.
One such example would be the word used in Hindi/Punjabi for a
brother-in-law (Saala). If used in the correct context, the said word actually means
nothing more than a brother-in-law, but it is too often used as a pejorative in
common parlance, and thus is used as a derogatory/abusive word. However, no
offence is usually made out by the use of that word because it does not pertain to
any specific caste or community of people and is actually a term common to all
castes in most parts of Northern India.
Hence, the usage of that word is usually not taken to be a criminal
60.            However, when a word denoting a caste or class of people who belong
to a Scheduled Caste/Scheduled Tribe is used in a derogatory sense, I would agree
with learned counsel for respondent no.2 at least prima facie (for the purpose of this
petition), that it has become common parlance to use it as a pejorative word, thereby
bringing indignity to that entire class of people, if it is used to its describe a person
not behaving in a 'good manner', in the eyes of the person using the word.
The petitioner having used the word (bhangi) to state that his friend
did not do something good by making his father dance in a ceremony, seemingly at
least, at this stage, the word was not used in any good sense but, as said, in a
pejorative manner.
In that context, it is to be noticed that (as has also been pointed out by
Mr. Sheoran, learned counsel for the complainant-respondent no.2), the dictionary
meaning of the “pejorative” is a word expressing contempt or dis-approval.
61.            Hence, in the opinion of this court, unless the investigating agency
finally comes to a different conclusion, it cannot be said at least as regards lodging
the FIR, that a person belonging to a Scheduled Caste would not be hurt by the use
of the word as such pejorative, when the word traditionally otherwise pertains
to a class of persons/caste of a person, i.e. a notified Scheduled Caste in almost all
of Northern India, as also in many other States in the country (as per the copies of
the notifications annexed with the reply of respondent no.2).
Thus, even though this court has already observed hereinabove, that
the petitioner very obviously did not actually intend to insult anyone, yet, he having
used a word pertaining to a specific Scheduled Caste, in a derogatory sense, in my
opinion even the ratio of the judgment cited by Mr. Sheoran would hold, at least
prima facie for the purpose of this petition (seeking that the FIR be quashed), to the
effect that: “The use of word Harijan, Dhobi, etc. is often used by people belonging
to the so-called upper castes as a word of insult, abuse and derision; and as citizens
of the country, we should always bear in “mind and heart that no person or
community should be insulted or looked down upon and that nobodys' feelings
should be hurt.” (Reference paragraph 16 of Manju Devis' case (supra).
Of course, in Mayer Hans Georges' case (supra), as has been relied
upon by learned senior counsel for the petitioner, it was held that mens rea is an
essential ingredient of a statutory offence and simply because the object of a statute
is to promote welfare activities or to eradicate grave social evils, the question of
whether or not there is an element of a guilty mind, would still need to be
However, first of course the Act in question was obviously not in
existence in 1965 and though the ratio of that judgment would otherwise apply to
any offences punishable under the Act also in view of what has been held therein
(as reproduced in paragraph 30 hereinabove), yet, the Act having also been
extensively amended in 2016, with the aims and objectives thereof stating that the a
members of a scheduled castes and scheduled tribes are subjected to various
indignities, humiliations and harassment, and in Manju Devis' case (supra) it having
been held that words denoting such castes are being used as word of insult, abuse
and derision, in my opinion at least for the purpose of this petition seeking quashing of
the FIR in question, the absence of mens rea would not entitle the petitioner to
quashing of the FIR, the effect of the usage of the word (bhangi) obviously not being in
a good light by any chance but as a pejorative.
As already observed by this court in the first order passed, issuing notice
of motion in this case, all persons, specifically celebrities, need to be very careful in the
language that they use, especially when they are using it on social media etc.
In that context, the judgment in Amish Devgans' case (supra) can also be
cited (reference paragraph 76 thereof, SCC edition).
It also needs to be observed by this court that in particular circumstances
of the cases, the Supreme Court has jurisdiction under Article 142 of the Constitution
to come to a particular conclusion to do complete justice between the parties. However,
very obviously, a high court exercising jurisdiction under Section 482 of the Cr.P.C.
does not have that power by any yardstick.
Therefore, in view of the discussion hereinabove, specifically keeping in
view the aims and objectives of the Act, in my opinion if the effect of the word used is
causing emotional hurt, humiliation etc. to any members of scheduled castes and
scheduled tribes, a particular caste name having been used in a derogatory manner,
even if the intention of the petitioner was obviously not to actually so hurt any person,
yet it would not entitle this court to quash the FIR on that ground, even though learned
Senior counsel for the petitioner submitted that the petitioner is willing to do charitable
work for the welfare of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes.
62.            It is to be again observed by this court that the Act of 1989, as amended
up to date, is intended to serve the purpose of betterment of the lives of persons
belonging to the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes and consequently, in the
opinion of this court, usage of word -names denoting particular Scheduled Castes or
communities as derogatory words, would amount to insulting any such
person belonging to that caste and hence, whether any offence under the provision
of that Act is made out or not, would need to be properly investigated by the
investigating agency concerned.
Consequently, as regards whether any offence punishable under the
provisions of the Act has been committed or not, would be investigated by the
investigating agency; and it is not a case where the FIR can be quashed qua the
allegation pertaining to those offences.
63.             In a nutshell, though this court has held that no offence punishable
under Section 153-B of the IPC would be even prima facie made out against the
petitioner and as regards any offence punishable under Section 153-A of the Code,
it would not be made out on the touchstone of the ratio of the judgments of the
Supreme Court in Balwant Singh and Manzar Sayeed Khans' cases (both
supra); and despite the wordings used in Section 3(1)(u) of the Act being to a
large extent pari materia with Section 153-A(1)(a), yet, in my opinion,
whereas mens rea would be a pre-requisite for invoking the provisions of
Section 153-A (even as per the aforesaid judgments), however that would not
necessarily be so as regards any offence punishable under the Act,
specifically Section 3(1)(u) thereof, the objective of the Act being also to
ensure that members of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes are not
subjected to any indignities and humiliation.
Therefore even if the intention of the user of the word may not
be so but the result thereof is to cause 'indignities/humiliation to any member
of a scheduled caste, by reference to any name of a caste as a derogatory
word or a pejorative, the intention of the user of such word may become
insignificant, looking at the aims and objective of the Act; further seeing
what has been held by the Supreme Court in Manju Devis' case (supra), that
the use of such words like Harijan, Dhobhi etc. as words of insult, abuse and
derision, can amount to being offences under the Act. (Reference paragraphs
16 and 17 of that judgment, SCC edition).
64.           As a result of the aforesaid discussion, this petition is partly allowed
to the extent that qua the offences punishable under Sections 153-A and 153-B of
the IPC, the said offences are not found to be offences committed by the petitioner
even prima facie for the reasons given hereinabove in paragraphs 53 to 56
(especially on the touchstone of the judgment in Balwant Singhs' case (supra), as
regards Section 153-A); but as regards the commission of any offence punishable
under the provisions of the Act of 1989, the petition is dismissed, with the
investigating agency to continue with its investigation wholly impartially and
independently, to come to its own conclusion as to whether any such offence has
been committed by the petitioner or not.
