Heard the learned counsel appearing for the parties.
The minor girl succumbed to the injuries in an
accident that occurred on 19.04.2015.
2.     The Tribunal by its judgment and award dated
16.08.2016 has awarded a compensation of Rs.3,50,000/-
with interest at 9% from the date of petition till the date of
realization.    Being dissatisfied with the quantum of
compensation awarded by the Tribunal, the claimants
being parents of the deceased minor girl has filed this
appeal for enhancement of compensation.
3.     Learned counsel for the appellants/claimants
placed reliance on the judgment of the Hon’ble Apex Court
in the case of Kishan Gopal and Another vs. Lala and
others (AIR 2013 SCW 5037) wherein the Hon’ble Apex
Court has awarded compensation of Rs.4,50,000/- and
another Rs.50,000/- under conventional heads.
4.    It is his further submission that in the case on
hand, the deceased was aged 2 years at the time of
accident. In the case of this nature, it is difficult to assess
the loss in pecuniary term and that the Motor Vehicles Act
is also silent in providing any basis to award just
compensation.       Under these circumstances, it is his
submission that what has been held by the Hon’ble Apex
Court has to be followed in the facts and circumstances of
the case.
5.    Learned counsel for the respondent No.2 –
Insurance Company submits that the deceased was aged
about 2 years and she is not an earning member of the
family and the appellants are not dependants.          It is her
further   submission     that  whatever   the    compensation
awarded by the Tribunal is just and proper.
6.    I have heard the learned counsel appearing for the
parties and gone through the judgment relied upon by the
learned counsel for the appellants. It is difficult to assess the
compensation in case of a death of minor.        The age of the
deceased is not in dispute. The compensation as well as the
future prospects cannot be decided on the basis of gender.
7.    An accident leading to the death of a child causes
great shock and agony to the parents and family of the
deceased.    The greatest agony for a parent is to lose their
child during their lifetime. Children are valued for their love,
affection, companionship and their role in the family unit.
8.    Modern jurisdictions world-over have recognized
that the value of a child's consortium far exceeds the
economic value of the compensation awarded in the case of
the death of a child. Most jurisdictions permit parents to be
awarded compensation under loss of consortium on the death
of a child. The amount awarded to the parents is the
compensation     for   loss  of   love,  affection,    care  and
companionship of the deceased child.
9.   The Co-ordinate Bench of this Court in the case of
Sagar since deceased by his LRs. Vs. Suresh and two
others reported in 2014 KAR MAC 506 (KAR) relying on the
judgment of the Hon’ble Apex Court in Kishan Gopal’s case
has awarded compensation of Rs.4,50,000/- towards ‘loss of
dependency’ in case of death of a boy who was aged 6 years.
10.  Under the circumstances, I am inclined to rely on
the judgment of the Hon’ble Apex Court in Kishna Gopal’s
case stated supra and award compensation of Rs.4,50,000/-
towards ‘loss of dependency’ and Rs.50,000/- towards loss of
love and affection, funeral expenses and transportation of a
dead    body   and    the  total   compensation   comes     to
In the result, the appeal is allowed in part and the
judgment and award dated 16.08.2016 passed by the XIII
Addl. Small Cause Judge and Member, MACT, Bengaluru
in MVC No.2980/2015 is hereby modified by awarding
additional compensation of Rs.1,50,000/- with interest at 6%
p.a. from the date of petition till realization of the award
