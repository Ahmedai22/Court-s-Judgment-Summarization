2.    The present appeals are directed against the final order dated 12.10.2018
passed by the High Court of Delhi, (hereinafter referred to as “High Court”) in
Review Petition No. 391 of 2018 and against the impugned final judgment
dated 11.09.2018 passed by the High Court of New Delhi.
3. Briefly, the facts relevant for the purpose of this appeal are as follows:
I. The Appellant, who is a scrap dealer, was travelling in a bus bearing
No. UP-25T-9664 towards his residence in Delhi from his native place
at Noor Pur, Gajrola.
II. The driver of the bus, who is the Respondent No.1 herein was driving
in a rash and negligent manner. At around 12:30 am, near the Jindal
Pipe Factory in Ghaziabad, the Respondent no.1 driver hit a standing
tempo which was parked on the left side of the road.
III. As a result of this accident, the Appellant and the other passengers in
the bus received grave injuries all over their bodies. The Appellant
was aged 37 years at the time of the accident and was earning
Rs.10,000/- per month. As per the Disability Certificate, the Appellant
suffered permanent disability of 70%, his right lower limb amongst
other injuries.
4.      The Appellant after the accident filed a claim petition before the
claiming a compensation of Rs.20,00,000/- (Twenty Lakhs).
5.      The Ld. Motor Accident Claim Tribunal (hereinafter referred to as
‘MACT’) after examining the evidence and issues at hand, held that the
Respondent No.1 was the driver of the vehicle, and it was his rash and
negligent driving that caused the accident. The Ld. MACT awarded a
compensation of Rs.15,76,465/- to the Appellant along with 7.5% interest
per annum, the breakup of the same is as follows:
Cost Of Artificial limb and its Maintenance      Rs. 5,70,000/-
Loss due to Disability and Disfigurement         Rs. 1,00,000/-
6.    The Appellant then filed MAC App. No. 444/2013 before the High
Court of Delhi on grounds that the Ld. MACT did not calculate the loss
of earning capacity, future prospects and wrong computation of the
Appellant’s disability.
7.     The High Court of Delhi vide judgment dated 11.09.2018 modified
the award passed by the Ld. MACT and disposed of the Appeal by
enhancing the compensation to Rs.16,70,932/- with 9% interest per
annum. The relevant part of the judgment reads as follows:-
“…Upon hearing and on perusal of impugned Award and the
evidence on record, I find that on the aspect of discrepancy in
timing of the accident, there is no cross- examination of Injured
and so, Insurer cannot be absolved from paying the
compensation awarded. It is not the case of Conductor (R2W1)
that the Injured was not travelling in the bus in question.
Therefore, the Tribunal has rightly relied upon the evidence of
Injured (PW-4) to hold that the negligence was of the bus driver
in causing of the accident in question. The Tribunal has
assessed the functional disability of Injured to be 30%. The
permanent disability is 70% in relation to right lower limb. It is
a case of amputation of right leg below the knee and so, the
functional disability is assessed at 35%. On the quantum
aspect, I find that though there is "loss of future earning", but
the "earning capacity" of the Injured has been certainly
compromised. Income of the deceased has been assessed by the
Tribunal on the basis of ITRS, which were filed after this
accident, but there is no basis to conclude that the income of
Injured was less than the one reflected in the ITRS for the year
2008-09. On this aspect also, there is no cross-examination of
Injured. Therefore, in the facts of instant case, the Tribunal has
rightly assessed the "loss of earning capacity" while taking the
income of the Injured as reflected in the ITRs. The Tribunal has
erred in applying the multiplier of 16. The applicable multiplier
is of 15. As regards the age of Injured, there is no cross-
examination of the Injured on this aspect. Therefore, the age of
the Injured is taken to be 37 years, which would attract the
multiplier of 15. ITRS relied upon by Injured reveals that his
income had increased despite the disability caused and so, it
cannot be said that there is "loss of future earning.…”
8.      Subsequently, the Appellant filed a Review Petition No. 391 of
2018 before the High Court of New Delhi seeking for enhancement of
compensation to Rs.20,00,000/-, and the same was dismissed vide
judgment dated 12.10.2018 whilst upholding the judgment passed in the
appeal. Being aggrieved by the same, the Appellant herein has filed the
present Civil Appeal.
9.      The Ld. Counsel for the Appellant contended that : -
I. The High Court wrongly assessed the appellant’s loss of income due to
the disability to be only 35%, when the medical board has assessed the
petitioner’s permanent disability to be 70%. The appellant as a result of
the injuries cannot drive his vehicle and cannot lift heavy weights.
II. Since the Appellant’s income was assessed on the basis of documentary
evidence, the Appellant ought to have been awarded future prospects to
the extent of 50%.
III. The compensation granted for the repair, purchase and maintenance of
the Artificial leg is inadequate. It was submitted that the cost of the
artificial limb is Rs.2,60,000/-, and the life of the limb is 5-6 years. The
limb further requires repair after every 6 months, and the cost of repair
is between Rs.15,000/- to Rs.20,000/-. The Appellant is aged only 37
years and will require the limb for the rest of his life, which would mean
that the current compensation of Rs.5,20,000/- is inadequate.
IV. The compensation awarded to the Appellant under the head “Pain and
Agony” and “loss due to disability and disfigurement” being
Rs.1,00,000/- each is inadequate. The counsel relied on Anant son of
Sidheshwar Dukre Vs. Pratap son of Zhamnnappa Lamzane & Anr.1.
10.     Per contra, The Ld. Counsel for the respondents contended that:
I. The High Court has rightly taken functional disability as 35% towards
amputation of lower limb. The High Court has already increased the
future loss of Income from Rs.6,09,345/- to Rs.6,66,480/- and further
increased the amount towards conveyance from Rs.10,000/- to
II. The High Court has rightly not granted future prospects as the Income
Tax Returns of the Appellant has increased despite disability caused
from Rs. 1,26,947/- from 01.04.2007 to 31.03.2008 to Rs.1,67,147/-
from 01.04.2008 to 31.03.2009.
1 Civil Appeal No. 8420 of 2018 (Dated : August 21, 2022)
III. The Appellant is a scrap dealer and works out of his shop. He does not
require a lot of movement to carry out his work and therefore his
disability does not affect his earning capacity.
IV. The Appellant had already filed a review petition in the High Court and
the same was dismissed rightfully.
11.     We have heard the counsels appearing on behalf of the Appellant
and the Respondents in great detail.
12.     The High Court has rightly held that the accident in question did
take place, the Appellant did suffer damages due to the negligence of
Respondent No.1 driver and that the Insurer cannot be absolved from
paying the compensation Awarded. The only question that remains for us
to decide is on the aspect of the quantum of damages awarded.
13.     The Appellant has suffered an amputation of the lower right limb, a
fracture in the medial wall of the bilateral orbit, crush injury right leg,
fracture tibia right leg, exposed vessels and other injuries. As per the
disability certificate, the Appellant has suffered 70% disability, however
the High Court has held that the Appellant has only suffered 35% loss in
future earnings due to the disability.
14.     To assess the quantum of compensation to be awarded, this Court
has to assess whether the permanent disability caused has any adverse
effect on the earning capacity of the Appellant, as held by this Court in
the case of Sandeep Khanuja Vs. Atul Dande and Anr. 2. The relevant
paragraph of the judgment is quoted hereunder :-
“The crucial factor which has to be taken into consideration
thus is to assess whether the permanent disability has any
adverse effect on the earning capacity of the injured. We feel
that the conclusion of the MACT on the application of
aforesaid test is erroneous. A very myopic view is taken by
the MACT in taking the view that 70% permanent disability
suffered by the appellant would not impact the earning
capacity of the appellant. The MACT thought that since the
appellant is a chartered accountant he is supposed to do
sitting work and therefore his working capacity
is not impaired….. A person who is engaged and cannot
freely move to attend to his duties may not be able to match
the earning in comparison with the one who is healthy and
bodily able. Movements of the appellant have been restricted
to a large extent and that too at a young age.”
15.    This Court has also laid out in the case of Raj Kumar Vs Ajay Kumar
and Anr.3 that where the claimant suffers a permanent disability as a result of
injuries, the assessment of compensation for loss of future earnings would
depend upon the impact and effect of the Permanent Disability on his earning
capacity. This Court observed as under :-
“Where the claimant suffers a permanent disability as a
result of injuries, the assessment of compensation under the
head of loss of future earnings, would depend upon the effect
and impact of such permanent disability on his earning
capacity. The Tribunal should not mechanically apply the
percentage of permanent disability as the percentage of
economic loss or loss of earning capacity. In most of the
cases, the percentage of economic loss, that is, percentage of
loss of earning capacity, arising from a permanent disability
will be different from the percentage of permanent disability.
Some Tribunals wrongly assume that in all cases, a
particular extent (percentage) of permanent disability would
result in a corresponding loss of earning capacity, and
consequently, if the evidence produced show 45% as the
permanent disability, will hold that there is 45% loss of
future earning capacity. In most of the cases, equating the
extent (percentage) of loss of earning capacity to the extent
(percentage) of permanent disability will result in award of
either too low or too high a compensation. What requires to
be assessed by the Tribunal is the effect of the permanently
disability on the earning capacity of the injured; and after
assessing the loss of earning capacity in terms of a
percentage of the income, it has to be quantified in terms of
money, to arrive at the future loss of earnings (by applying
the standard multiplier method used to determine loss of
dependency). We may however note that in some cases, on
appreciation of evidence and assessment, the Tribunal may
find that percentage of loss of earning capacity as a result of
the permanent disability, is approximately the same as the
percentage of permanent disability in which case, of course,
the Tribunal will adopt the said percentage for determination
of compensation.”
16.    The Appellant herein has suffered permanent disability of 70% and
has an amputated right lower limb amongst other injuries. The High
Court has wrongly taken the view that the Appellant has only suffered
35% functional disability. The Appellant is not a salaried person but is
self-employed who manages his business. For the Appellant to be able to
augment his income, he is most definitely required to move around. The
Appellant can also not drive on his own, which hinders his mobility
further. This proves that the functional disability of the Appellant will
severely impact his earning capacity, and the 35% functional disability
calculated by the High Court is incorrect in the facts and circumstances of
the case and in our view the loss of future earning capacity must be
calculated at 60%.
17.    The High Court has not applied the quantum for future prospect in
the compensation granted. In its reasoning, the High Court has stated that
the Income tax returns relied upon by the Appellant show that despite the
injury the Appellant’s income had subsequently increased and hence it
cannot be said that there is a loss of future earnings.
18.     It is a well settled position of law that in cases of permanent
disablement caused by a motor accident, the claimant is entitled to not
just future loss of income, but also future prospects. It has been reiterated
by this Court in multiple instances that “just compensation” must be
interpreted in such a manner as to place the claimant in the same position
as he was before the accident took place.
19.    The accident that caused the injury took place on 12.06.2009. The
acknowledgement of both the Income Tax Returns produced by the
Appellant show that Tax Returns were till 31.03.2008 and 31.03.2009.
Both the Income Tax Returns produced as proof of income were from
before the accident took place, and hence the High Court’s finding that
the income of the Appellant has increased after the disability is incorrect.
20.    It is also to be noted that even if the income of the Appellant had
increased after the accident, it would not be enough grounds to disable
the Appellant from claiming compensation for future prospect as the rise
in income may be attributed to multiple other factors.
21.    In light of National Insurance Company Limited v. Pranay Sethi
& Others4, the applicable 40% addition of future prospects will be given
as compensation to the Appellant herein.
22.    The High Court has awarded a compensation of Rs.5,20,000/- for
the prosthetic limb and Rs.50,000/- towards repair and maintenance of the
same. The Appellant submits that the cost of the prosthetic limb itself is
Rs. 2,60,000/- and the life of the prosthetic limb is only 5-6 years. The
prosthetic limb also requires repair and maintenance after every 6 months
to 1 year, and each repair costs between Rs.15,000 to Rs.20,000/-. This
would mean that the prosthetic limb would last the Appellant for only 15
years under the current compensation. The Appellant at the time of the
accident was aged 37 years and has a full life ahead. It has been clearly
stated by this Court in the case of Anant Son of Sidheshwar Dukre
(Supra) that the purpose of fair compensation is to restore the injured to
the position he was in prior to the accident as best as possible. The
relevant paragraph of the judgment is being extracted herein:
“In cases of motor accidents leading to injuries and
disablements, it is a well settled principle that a person
must not only be compensated for his physical injury, but
also for the non-pecuniary losses which he has suffered due
to the injury. The Claimant is entitled to be compensated for
his inability to lead a full life and enjoy those things and
amenities which he would have enjoyed, but for the
injuries.”
“The purpose of compensation under the Motor Vehicles Act
is to fully and adequately restore the aggrieved to the
position prior to the accident.”
23.    As per the current compensation given for the prosthetic limb and
its maintenance, it would last the Appellant for only 15 years, even if we
were to assume that the limb would not need to be replaced after a few
years. The Appellant was only 37 years at the time of the accident, and it
would be reasonable to assume that he would live till he is 70 years old if
not more. We are of the opinion that the Appellant must be compensated
so that he is able to purchase three prosthetic limbs in his lifetime and is
able to maintain the same at least till he has reached 70 years of age. For
the Prosthetic limbs alone, the Appellant is to be awarded compensation
of Rs. 7,80,000 and for maintenance of the same he is to be awarded an
additional Rs. 5,00,000/-.
24.    The High Court has upheld the compensation awarded by the Ld.
Tribunal for non-pecuniary damages, which comes to Rs. 3,00,000/- in
total. Considering the nature of the permanent disability caused by the
accident and the effect it will have on the Appellant’s life, this Court is of
the opinion that the compensation provided by the High Court for non-
pecuniary heads is inadequate.
25.    In R.D. Hattangadi v. Pest Control (India) (P) Ltd. 5 dealing with
the different heads of compensation in injury cases this Court held that:
“Broadly speaking while fixing the amount of compensation
payable to a victim of an accident, the damages have to be
assessed separately as pecuniary damages and special
damages. Pecuniary damages are those which the victim has
actually incurred and which are capable of being calculated
in terms of money; whereas non-pecuniary damages are
those which are incapable of being assessed by arithmetical
calculations. In order to appreciate two concepts pecuniary
damages may include expenses incurred by the claimant: (i)
medical attendance; (ii) loss of earning of profit up to the
date of trial; (iii) other material loss. So far as non-
pecuniary damages are concerned, they may include: (i)
damages for mental and physical shock, pain and suffering,
already suffered or likely to be suffered in the future; (ii)
damages to compensate for the loss of amenities of life
which may include a variety of matters i.e. on account of
injury the claimant may not be able to walk, run or sit; (iii)
damages for loss of expectation of life i.e. on account of
injury the normal longevity of the person concerned is
shortened; (iv) inconvenience, hardship, discomfort,
disappointment, frustration and mental stress in life.”
26.    In light of the above decision of this Court and the facts and
circumstances of the case at hand, the compensation to be awarded is as
I. Compensation for pain and suffering – Rs. 2,00,000/-
II. Compensation for Loss of Amenities of Life – Rs. 2,00,000/-
III. Compensation for disability and disfigurement – Rs. 2,00,000/-
27.    We are of the opinion that while awarding compensation in cases
of permanent disability caused to claimants, the courts must look at the
case in totality, and must consider the socio-economic background of the
claimants. The Appellant herein comes from an economically weaker
section of the society.
28.    It is almost universally seen that persons from marginalized
backgrounds often face an additional layer of discrimination due to bodily
disabilities. This is because persons from marginalized sections of the
society already face severe discrimination due to a lack of social capital,
and a new disability more often than not compounds to such
discrimination. In such circumstances, to preserve the essence of justice,
it becomes the duty of the Court to at the very least restore the claimant
as best as possible to the position he was in before the occurrence of the
disability, and to do so must award compensation in a liberal manner.
29.    While no material compensation can completely negate the trauma
and suffering that the injured and his family faces, the law only knows the
language of monetary compensation in such cases. It then becomes to
duty of the court to translate the provisions of monetary compensation
into a fabrication that helps the injured and his family in coping with their
30.     On the basis of the abovementioned facts and analysis, this Court is
of the opinion that the just compensation to be awarded to the
claimant/appellant under different heads ought to be as under :-
Cost Of Artificial limb and its Maintenance       Rs. 12,80,000/-
Loss Of Earning Capacity due to Functional Rs. 11,34,000/-
Loss due to Disability and Disfigurement          Rs. 2,00,000/-
31.   In view of the aforesaid facts and circumstances, the impugned
judgment is liable to be modified as above and the claimant/appellant is
held entitled to be awarded compensation to the tune of Rs. 38,70,120/-
along with 9% interest per annum from the date of making the
application.
32.   Accordingly, the appeals stand allowed.
