Dated this the 1st day of August, 2022
The appellant/wife filed Mat.Appeal No.181 of 2013 against
the dismissal of O.P No.944 of 2005 on the file of Family Court,
Thiruvananthapuram, and she along with her three children filed
R.P (F.C) No.41 of 2019, challenging the order in M.C No.248 of
2010 dated 10.05.2017.           In both cases, the respondent is her
2. Brief facts necessary for the appeal could be stated as
The appellant and the respondent are husband and wife.
Their marriage was solemnised on 11.03.1990 as per Muslim
rites and custom. Three children were born in their lawful
wedlock. At the time of marriage, the appellant was given 50
sovereigns of gold ornaments and 42 cents of land from her
family, apart from a gold chain weighing 2 sovereigns and a gold
ring weighing 1 sovereign given to the respondent/ husband. By
selling away her 50 sovereigns of gold ornaments, the husband
purchased plaint ‘A’ schedule property having 25 cents in his
name though it was agreed to be purchased in her name. Only
later she could realise that the document was registered in the
name of the respondent. The respondent constructed a house in
plaint ‘A’ schedule property expending his own money. But the
movables in that house were gifted to the appellant from her
family. The respondent ill-treated the appellant demanding more
dowry. Her brothers purchased six cents of land in her name,
but the respondent compelled her to sell away that property for
constructing shop rooms in ‘A’ schedule property. She sold away
that property for Rs.2,40,000/- and that amount was utilised for
constructing five shop rooms in ‘A’ schedule property.     In April
2005, the appellant and her children were ousted from the house
in the ‘A’ schedule property, and thereafter he contracted a
second     marriage.     The     appellant and her children   were
abandoned by the respondent and he failed even to pay their
maintenance. So, she filed O.P No.944 of 2005, for declaring her
title over ‘A’ schedule property and to get back ‘B’ schedule
movables kept in the house in ‘A’ schedule. She along with her
three children filed M.C No.185 of 2005 for maintenance from
the respondent.
3. The respondent/husband filed counter affidavit denying
the claim of the appellant/wife. According to him, the appellant
was leading a wayward life and she misused and misappropriated
the amounts he had given to her, while he was working abroad.
No property was purchased by selling away her gold ornaments,
and no property was purchased in her name by her brothers.
The house as well as the shop rooms in ‘A’ schedule were
constructed by the respondent using his own hard earned
money. Regarding her maintenance claim also, the respondent
disowned his liability as he was even doubting the paternity of
the children.
4. After formulating necessary issues by the Family Court,
the parties went on trial. Both the O.P and M.C were tried
together. PW1 was examined and Exts.A1 to A15 were marked
from the side of the appellant/wife, and RW1 was examined and
Ext.B1 was marked from the side of the respondent/husband.
5. On an anxious consideration of the rival contentions put
forward     from     either    side,    the   Family   Court  dismissed
O.P No.944 of 2005 and allowed M.C No.185 of 2005, awarding
monthly     maintenance       allowance     @   Rs.2,000/-,  Rs.1,850/-,
Rs.2,150/- and Rs.1,600/- respectively to petitioners 1 to 4.
6.     Against the order in M.C No.185 of 2005, the
respondent/husband          preferred    R.P   (F.C)  No.257   of  2009
challenging the quantum of maintenance awarded, as he had lost
his job and suffered a stroke as well. This Court, as per
judgment dated 18.03.2010, revised and fixed the monthly
maintenance allowance @ Rs.2,000/- to the wife and Rs.1,500/-
each to the children from 29.10.2005, giving liberty to the
parties to move for variance, when circumstances exist under
Section 127 of Cr.P.C.
7.    Later, the respondent/husband filed C.M.P No.229 of
2010 under Section 127 of Cr.P.C to modify the maintenance
order, as he had no assets or source of income, after his return
from Gulf. That C.M.P was converted into M.C No.248 of 2010.
PWs 1 to 3 were examined and Exts.A1 to A14 were marked from
the side of the husband and CPWs 1 and 2 were examined and
Exts.B1 to B6 were marked from the side of the wife .
8. The learned Family Court Judge, on analysing the facts
and evidence, found that the husband is suffering from renal
problem and he needs kidney transplantation and moreover a
portion of his body was paralysed as he had suffered a stroke.
Finding that the husband had no means to pay the maintenance,
the order passed in M.C No.185 of 2005 was altered and it was
ordered that the wife and children were not entitled to recover
maintenance from the respondent/husband from the date of
petition. Challenging that order dated 10.05.2017, the wife and
children preferred R.P (FC) No.41 of 2019.
9. Let us have a scrutiny of the facts and evidence, to find
out whether any interference is warranted in the judgment and
order impugned.
10.     Admittedly, the appellant and the respondent are
husband and wife. Ext.A3 document shows that, even prior to
the marriage, the appellant/wife was having 43 cents of land,
settled in her favour by her sister.      The respondent is not
disputing that fact, and that property is not a subject matter
here.   Though the appellant contended that, in connection with
the marriage, she was given 50 sovereigns of gold ornaments as
her patrimony, no evidence is forthcoming to support that
contention. There is no evidence to show that, a gold chain
weighing 2 sovereigns and a gold ring weighing 1 sovereign were
given to the respondent in connection with the marriage.
11. Though the pleadings of the appellant are to the effect
that, her 50 sovereigns of gold ornaments were utilised for
purchasing 'A' schedule property, there is no pleading to the
effect that, those ornaments were ever entrusted with the
respondent. But, when examined before court as PW1, she put
forward a new case that her entire 50 sovereigns of gold
ornaments were put in the locker of the sister of the respondent
and without informing her, those ornaments were sold away and
the sale proceeds were utilised to purchase 'A' schedule property.
At the same time, she has got a contention that, the respondent
had agreed to purchase 'A' schedule property in her name. But,
only later she came to know that the said property was
purchased in the name of the respondent himself.
12. The appellant is admitting that, at the time of marriage
and even thereafter, the respondent was employed in Gulf
countries drawing monthly income of Rs.1 lakh.       The appellant
had no job or income of her own.        In the absence of evidence
either to show that, the appellant was having 50 sovereigns of
gold ornaments at the time of marriage, or to prove entrustment
of that gold with the respondent or his sister, we could not
presume that 'A' schedule property was purchased in the name
of the respondent, by selling away the gold ornaments of the
13.    The    appellant      contended    that,   the   respondent
compelled her to bring money from her family for constructing a
house in 'A' schedule property. Her case is that, when there was
pressure to bring money from home, her brothers purchased six
cents of land in her name. If she was compelled to bring money,
there was no probability for her brothers to purchase a landed
property in her name.         According to her, that six cents of land
was    subsequently      sold    away    for a   sale   consideration  of
Rs.2,40,000/- and with that amount, five shop rooms were
constructed in 'A' schedule property.              But, no evidence is
forthcoming      to   substantiate     that  fact.    According   to  the
respondent,      he    himself     purchased   'A'  schedule    property,
constructed a house therein, and later constructed shop rooms
also in that property, for which no gold or money of the appellant
was utilised.
14. During cross examination, PW1 admitted that, the sale
proceeds of her property was never entrusted with the husband,
and it was deposited in her own bank account. Admittedly, she
sold away her 43 cents to her brother, and the sale proceeds
were deposited in her account, and that amount also was never
given to the respondent. Subsequently, she returned that money
to her brother and got the property reconveyed in her name.
There is nothing to show that 'A' schedule property was
purchased and the house and shop rooms were constructed with
the funds of the appellant. So, the Family Court rightly found
that she was not entitled for a declaration as prayed for, with
respect to 'A' schedule property.
15. Now coming to the 'B' schedule movables, according to
the appellant, 38 items in 'B' schedule belonged to her and it was
gifted to her from her family. But, during cross examination, she
admitted that, the gas connection which she had claimed is in
the name of her husband. The motorcycle claimed by her was
brought by the husband from Gulf. According to her, item Nos.1
to 28 were given from her family in connection with the
housewarming function. But, there is no evidence to show that
'B' schedule movables were either purchased or gifted to the
appellant from her family. Admittedly, she had no job or income
at the time of marriage or even after that.       The Family Court
rightly rejected her claim for recovery of 'B' schedule movables
also.  Hence her Mat.Appeal No.181 of 2013 is liable to be
16. Coming to R.P (F.C) No.41 of 2019, the Family Court,
by the impugned order dated 10.05.2017, altered the order in
M.C No.185 of 2005, finding that the appellant and her children
are not entitled to recover maintenance from the respondent
from the date of the petition. It is not specified from the date of
which petition the order was altered.
17.    Originally in M.C No.185 of 2005, maintenance was
awarded to the wife and children finding that they have no
means for their sustenance, and the respondent/husband who
was having sufficient means was not maintaining them willfully.
Though the husband approached this Court by filing R.P(FC)
No.257 of 2009 against the maintenance awarded in M.C No.185
of 2005, with similar allegations of stroke and no means, the
order was not cancelled, but it was only revised fixing the
maintenance @ Rs.2,000/- to the wife and Rs.1,500/- each to
the children. That judgment was dated 18.03.2010. Again the
respondent approached the Family Court for modification of the
maintenance allowance under Section 127 of Cr.P.C availing the
liberty granted by the High Court to move for variance.
18.     The Family Court found that the respondent was
suffering from kidney problem and a portion of his body was
paralysed due to stroke. He was found to be a man of no means,
incapable of doing any job also. There was no contra evidence
from the part of the wife to show that he was having any income
or assets in his name. Further she had no case that, he was
physically fit to do any job to earn income therefrom. So, the
finding of the Family Court that the order passed in M.C No.185
of 2005 requires alteration, is well founded. But, in fact, the
maintenance allowance prevailing then was the one modified and
fixed by this Court in R.P (F.C) No.257 of 2009. Since the parties
were given liberty by this Court to move for variance, the Family
Court was empowered to alter or modify that order, on being
satisfied that circumstances exist under Section 127 of Cr.P.C.
19. Now the question to be answered is what shall be the
crucial date on which an order of cancellation of maintenance
allowance to take effect?         Is it the date of the application for
cancellation or the date of the order. To put it otherwise whether
the order of cancellation of maintenance operates prospectively
or retrospectively?
20.   In the case on hand, the Family Court cancelled the
maintenance order from the date of application, which means the
cancellation was ordered retrospectively.
Section 125(2) of Cr.P.C reads thus:
“Any such allowance for the maintenance or interim
maintenance      and   expenses   for  proceeding  shall  be
payable from the date of the order, or, if so ordered, from
the date of the application for maintenance or interim
maintenance and expenses of proceeding, as the case
may be”.
So, maintenance allowance ordered under Section 125 Cr.P.C
shall be payable either from the date of order, or if so ordered it
can be from the date of application.
21.   Section 127(1) of Cr.P.C empowers the Magistrate to
alter the monthly maintenance awarded under Section 125
Cr.P.C,   on   proof    of   a   change   in   the  circumstances    and
Section 127(2)Cr.P.C gives the power to the Magistrate to cancel
or vary the order.      The legislature under Section 125(2) Cr.P.C
has given power to the Magistrate to date back the order to the
date of application, but such a power is not there under
Section 127(2) of Cr.P.C. So, the order of cancellation shall be
effective only from the date of order, and it cannot date back to
the date of application.         Till the order is altered, modified or
cancelled, the earlier orders will remain effective. So the order
of cancellation of maintenance always operates prospectively and
not retrospectively.
22.    In Balraj Singh vs. Balkar Singh (1983 (2) Crimes
506), the Punjab & Haryana High Court held that, Section 127(2)
of the Code of Criminal Procedure           enjoins that where after an
order for maintenance passed in favour of the wife under Section
125(2) of the Code, the husband obtains a decree necessitating
the cancellation of the order, the court shall cancel or vary the
order.    The legislature under Section 125(2) Cr.P.C has given
power to the Magistrate to date back the order of the application,
but does not give any such power under Section 127(2) of the
Code. We cannot read a power into the Code which is not there.
The order of cancellation of maintenance always operates
prospectively      and    not    retrospectively.   This  position  was
reiterated by the Rajasthan High Court in Harikishan vs.
Smt.Shantidevi (1989 Crl.LJ 439) as well.
23.     So, the impugned order altering/cancelling the
maintenance order in M.C No.185 of 2005 from the date of the
petition, is not valid or proper in the eye of law. The cancellation
order will take effect only from the date of cancellation i.e. from
10.05.2017. The R.P (F.C) is allowed to that extent.
In the result, Mat.Appeal is dismissed and R.P (F.C) is
allowed    in   part,    setting    aside  the order  cancelling the
maintenance awarded in M.C No.185 of 2005 from the date of
petition. It is further clarified that, the revision petitioners are
entitled to recover the arrears of maintenance as ordered in
M.C No.185 of 2005 and as modified in R.P (FC) No.257 of 2009
till 10.05.2017, and the cancellation order will take effect only
from the date of order i.e. 10.05.2017. No order as to costs.
