2.     Background involving the case is on 10.6.2001 during morning
hour deceased, a poor man while cutting bamboo Kanis and its branches
in order to repair his thatched house, he came in contact with the live
electric line, which was in hanging position at lower level. Coming in
contact, the deceased died instantly. F.I.R. being lodged, a case was
registered, vide U.D.Case No.8 of 2001 corresponding to U.D.G.R. Case
No.134 of 2001, vide Annexure-1. Police took up investigation. After
completion of inquest process, the dead body was sent to the District
Hospital, Jajpur for post-mortem. Final report was prepared indicating
cause of death due to asphyxia caused by coming in contact with live
electric wire otherwise suffered on account of electric shock. Document
to this extent was filed, vide Annexure-2 & 3. On the premises that the
deceased was strong and stout and middle aged man and was earning
about Rs.4000/- per month from his agricultural land and Bhaga Chasi
and seasonal business and through breeding domestic animals like cows
and goats also involving sale of milk. His family members, such wife and
son approached several times to the Department for appropriate
compensation and finding no respite compelled to file the present Writ
Petition ultimately in 2010.
3.     The Writ Petition was entertained in 2011, undisputedly, disclosing
pendency of a representation with the Electric Department involved
herein, vide Annexure-4 series. In spite of notice, there is no counter as of
now. However, on the basis of pleading and documents herein, the claim
of the Petitioners being objected by Mr.Mohanty, learned counsel for the
Establishment in charge presently on the premises that there has been no
establishment of allegation that the deceased has died coming in contact
of live electric wire belonging to the Department.
4.     Keeping in view the claim and counter claim, this Court taking into
account the F.I.R. finds, the F.I.R. has a clear allegation of death coming
in contact with the live electric wire hanging at a lower level. The inquest
report as well as post-mortem report reveals the reason of coming in
contact with the electric wire and death out of electric shock. This Court
finds, a representation was also filed by the Claimants requesting for
grant of appropriate compensation appended to as Annexure-4 series
since 12.7.2001. There is no filing of counter. There is no denial of any of
the averments by the Petitioners herein including submission of
representation even. Further for there is involvement of an F.I.R., it is not
possible that for the disclosures through F.I.R., the Department did not
choose at least to investigate such death. Besides, both the inquest report
and the post-mortem report also confirm the death of the deceased
coming in contact with the live wire of the Department undisputedly. The
representation claiming compensation was filed in 2001. It is not
expected that the Department shut down its eyes even after filing of Writ
Petition forget if to take steps for minimal enquiry on a representation
being filed at least to have a fact finding report. The Writ Petition was
even filed in 2010. There is no response to the pleading herein even
assuming there may be requirement of adjudication of the issue of
likelihood of the Electricity Department for loss of time of 20 years in the
meantime, it may remain futile in asking the Petitioners to go to the Civil
Court at this stage.
5.     At this stage, this Court finds, in similar situation, this Court in
disposal of OJC No.15558/97 by judgment dated 14.11.2014 has come to
allow the Writ Application of this nature. Case of the Petitioners also gets
support of another decision of this Court in Bhagaban Rout & anr. vrs.
Executive Engineer, CESCO, Salipur reported in 2023(I) OLR 188,
which is decided based on number of judgments of the Hon’ble apex
Court. In the process, this Court was pleased to grant compensation, as
6.     Keeping in view the position settled with the above judgment being
the support of judgments of the Hon’ble apex Court, this Court finds, the
Petitioners at great suffering end are entitled to compensation.
In the process, taking into consideration the age of the deceased,
the position of both the Claimants, Petitioner No.1 losing her husband at
the age of 37 years and keeping in view the age of her son being 15 years
at the time of death of the deceased though there is no proof of income of
the deceased except a bald statement that the deceased was earning
Rs.4000/- at the relevant point of time, this Court directs, at least a sum of
Rs.2,00,000/- (rupees two lakh) be paid to the Claimants to mitigate the
loss on account of suffering for all these years on account of the death of
the deceased, the sole Earner. The amount, as directed, be released by the
Company taking over NESCO, i.e., Tata Power Northern Odisha
Distribution Ltd., as undertaken, within a period of one and half months
from the date of communication of this judgment, failing which the
Petitioners will be entitled to interest @ 7% per annum from the date of
death of the deceased.
