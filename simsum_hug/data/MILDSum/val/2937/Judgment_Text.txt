This writ petition has been filed challenging the award dated
23.11.2020 which has been passed by the Presiding Officer, Central
1, Sector – H, Aliganj, Lucknow. Further the writ petition has also
challenged the notice/order dated 04.02.1998 which was issued by
District – Sonbhadra. The writ petition was finally heard after the
parties exchanged their affidavits.
Briefly stated the facts of the case are that the petitioner was
employed by the Indian Railway Construction International Ltd.
(hereinafter referred to as the ‘Company’) initially as a peon on
casual basis for a period of six months by the order of the Project
Manager Vindhyay Nagar, District – Sithi (M.P.) on 19.4.1984.
This was an employment under the grade “D” category. After the
completion of six months of continuous service, the petitioner was
re-employed on monthly basis with a consolidated wage of Rs.
196/- plus dearness allowance by an order dated 09.05.1985 and,
thereafter, he was attached with Anpara Project, District –
Mirzapur, U.P. His attachment there necessitated a training and on
the completion of it, he was employed on the scale of pay which
was in the grade pay of Rs. 196-237/-. This was done by an order
dated 29.05.1998 issued by the Regional Manager IRCON -
Anpara. In this arrangement, the petitioner continued for a period
of four years and was thereafter by an order dated 28.4.1989
brought in the regular scale. Thereafter the petitioner was
transferred from Vindhya Nagar Project to Rihand Nagar Project,
District - Sonbhadra U.P. by an order dated 23.12.1993. However,
on 04.02.1998 a notice was served upon the petitioner that with
effect from 06.02.1998 his services were dispensed with it.
Aggrieved by the termination/notice dated 04.02.1998, the
petitioner alongwith 74 other workmen filed a writ petition being
Writ Petition No. 6522 of 1998. However, the writ petition was
disposed of on 23.01.2002 whereby it was ordered that other than
the petitioners no. 31 & 61 the other petitioners who were 73 in
number were to be given Rs. 3 lacs as compensation. The petitioner
alongwith the petitioner no. 61 was given an option to file a writ
petition afresh. The petitioner instead of filing a writ petition raised
an industrial dispute and prayed for his reinstatement with back
wages. The conciliation proceedings failed and the matter was
referred by the Government of India to the Central Government
Tribunal- cum – Labour Court, Lucknow (hereinafter referred to as
the ‘Labour Court’) and this reference came to be numbered as
Reference No. 23 of 2009. When the award was passed by the
Labour Court on 23.11.2020, the instant writ petition was filed.
Before proceeding to enumerate arguments advanced by the
counsel for the petitioner, certain other facts also require a brief
Certain workmen who were employed with the company had
filed writ petitions which were numbered as 18561/1993,
32500/1993, 32651/1993, 34786/1993 and 44416/1993. When the
petitioners in these writ petitions had been found to be surplus and
their services were dispensed with then the above mentioned writ
petitions were filed. These writ petitions were connected to each
other and were decided by a common judgement on 7.12.1993 in
which the order impugned by which the petitioners therein had
been found to be surplus were set aside and the petitioners were
directed to be absorbed in other projects. The order dated 7.12.1993
was challenged in an Intra-court Special Appeal and the Special
Appellate Court had on 24.2.1998 allowed the special appeal and
set aside the order passed by the learned single judge dated
7.12.1993. Aggrieved thereof five civil appeals were filed before
the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court wherein on certain grounds
set aside the order of the Division Bench dated 4.12.1998 and also
set aside the order of the learned Single Judge dated 7.12.1993. The
Supreme Court while remanding the matter framed certain
questions for consideration and they were as follows:-
(i) Whether Anpara Rihand Nagar Project is subjected to a
factual closure as mentioned in the impugned notices of
March, 1998 or whether the project is not still completed;
(ii) In the light of the answer to the aforesaid question a
further question would arise whether impugned notices of
March, 1998 were in fact and in law closure notices as per
Section 25O read with Section 25FFF of the Act or whether
they still remain retrenchment notices and hence would be
(iii) Even if it is held that the Anpara Rihand Nagar project is
in fact closed down whether the 25 appellants were
employed in the project or they were employees of the
respondent – company entitling them to the absorbed in any
other project of the company and consequently whether the
impugned notices have not effected any snapping of
employer-employee relationship between the appellants of
the one hand and the Respondent-company on the other;
(iv) Even apart from the aforesaid questions whether the
impugned notices are violative of the guarantee of Articles
14, 16 and 21 of the Constitution of India on the ground that
the termination of services of the 25 appellants was arbitrary
and discriminatory, respondent company being a ‘State’
within the meaning of Article 12 of the Constitution of India.
Thereafter, upon remand, the five writ petitions being Writ
and 44416/1993 were heard by a Division Bench. When on
17.5.2009 there was a conflict of opinion between the two judges
of the Division Bench, again the matter went to the Supreme Court
and, thereafter, the Supreme Court remanded the matter back and
directed that the matter be disposed of on merit by a Full Bench of
the High Court. Before the Full Bench, those very four issues
which had been asked by the Supreme Court to be decided on
24.3.1998, were placed for consideration. All the issues were
thereafter decided in favour of the respondent-company and against
the petitioners. The Full Bench case was reported in 2004(5)AWC
3955All (Lal Mohammad vs. Indian Railway Construction Co.
Ltd. And others.). The petitioners in the Full Bench Case filed an
Appeal before the Supreme Court which was numbered as Civil
Appeal No. 6195-6198 of 2004 and Civil Appeal No. 5685 of 2006.
The decision of the Appeal before the Supreme Court reported in
AIR 2007 SC 2230 (Lal Mohammad and Ors. vs. Indian
Railway Construction Co. Ltd. and Ors.) specifically decided
that when a workman is employed for a particular project then the
services of that employee came to an end as soon as the project was
over and he could not be given a permanent status. It also held that
shortfall of period of notice or compensation, after completion of
the project ,would not render the termination bad on that count.
The Supreme Court found that the judgement of the Full
Bench of the Allahabad High Court was correct. It also found that
the petitioners were not entitled to be regularized in the services of
the Company as they were not employees of the company. It,
however, held that the petitioners were entitled for compensation
and thereafter the appeals were dismissed.
The petitioner in this writ petition has claimed that his case
was different from the case of Lal Mohammod (supra).
Learned counsel for the petitioner has submitted that the
petitioner was given a status of regular employee because he had
been given a scale of the regular employee with effect from
19.4.1984. He submits that on 19.5.1986 and 28.4.1989, the
petitioner was further granted certain status which were different
from the status which were granted to the petitioners in the case of
Lal Mohammad (supra). Learned counsel further reiterated the
provisions of 25H of the Industrial Disputes Act 1947 and stated
that the petitioner had a right to be reappointed if the work was
there. Learned counsel for the petitioner also submitted that
IRCON Services Rules provided for promotion, implementation,
regularization of casual employee.
Still further learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that
the manner in which the respondents company had conducted itself
clearly showed that it was resorting to unfair labour practices
which was prohibited by Section 25T and Section 25 U of the
Learned counsel relied upon 2000 AIR SCW 3865 (Mineral
Exploration Corporation Employees’ Union vs. Mineral
Exploration Corporation Ltd. & another) and submitted that
employees who were engaged continuously for a number of years
cannot be treated as temporary or casual employees. He, therefore,
submitted that the petitioners were entitled for regularization.
Learned counsel for the petitioner also submitted that his
case was absolutely different from the case of Meghu Seikh. He
submits that comparison of the case of Meghu Seikh with the case
of the petitioner was not called for.
Learned counsel for the respondent nos. 2, 3 and 4, however,
relying upon the judgements of Lal Mohammod(supra) which was
passed in the Full Bench decision of the High Court and was
confirmed by the Supreme Court has made her submission and has
submitted that the case of the petitioner was at similar footing with
the case of Meghu Seikh. She submitted that the very fact that the
petitioner had got regular scale did not mean that the petitioner had
been regularized. She still further submitted that the petitioner was
an employee of the Project and not of the Company. Still further
learned counsel for the respondents, Ms. Taniya Pandey submitted
that in pursuance of the law laid down in Secretary, State of
Karnataka vs. Uma Devi, reported in 2006 (4) SCC 1
regularization could be done only if there was a statutory rule
framed in that regard.
Having heard the learned counsel for the parties and after
having perused the written arguments which the parties have filed
(which are now made part of the record) and also upon going
through the award and the various pleadings which have been
exchanged by the parties, this Court finds that no interference is
warranted in the award. The Supreme Court in the case reported in
AIR 2007 SC 2230 (Lal Mohammad and Ors. vs. Indian
Railway Construction Co. Ltd. and Ors.) has categorically laid
down that when a workman is employed for a particular project,
the services of that employee came to an end when the project was
over and, therefore, could not be given a permanent status. It has
also held that the workman could not be considered as employee of
the company under which various other projects ran. This Court
also finds that there was similarity in the case of the petitioner and
the case of Meghu Seikh.
Under such circumstances, no interference is warranted in
the writ petition and the writ petition is, accordingly, dismissed.
