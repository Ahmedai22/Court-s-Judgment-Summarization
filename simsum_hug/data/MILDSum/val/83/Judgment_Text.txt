1.     This appeal has been preferred by the claimants-appellants
against the judgment and award dated 24.08.2021 passed by learned
(hereinafter referred to as ‘Tribunal’) in M.A.C.P. No. 116 of 2018
(Roop Lal and Another Vs. Suresh Kumar Yadav and others), whereby
the learned Tribunal awarded a sum of Rs.1,80,000/- as compensation
to the claimants with interest at the rate of 7.5% per annum.
2.     The claimants-appellants have preferred this appeal for
enhancement of quantum.
3.     The brief facts of the case are that a claim petition was filed
before the learned Tribunal by the claimants-appellants with the
averments that on 18.03.2018 claimant-appellant no.1, Roop Lal was
walking with his son on Kakvan Road within the jurisdiction of police
station Bilhaur Districct Kanpur Nagar. At that time, a truck bearing
no. U.P.93 BT 4990 who was being driven very rashly and negligently
by its driver, hit the son of the appellant no.1 from behind due to
which he fell on the road and front wheel of the truck ran over him.
Appellant no.1’s son sustained fatal injuries and died on the spot. The
deceased was a child of aged about 7 years.
4.     The respondents filed their respective written statements.
after considering the evidence on record, awarded
Rs.1,80,000/- to the appellants-claimants who are deceased’s father
and mother respectively.
5.     Aggrieved mainly with the compensation awarded, the
appellants preferred this appeal.
6.     Heard Mr. Mohd. Naushad Siddiqui, learned counsel for the
appellants, Mr. Vipul Kumar, learned counsel for the respondent no.3
and Mr. Shreesh Srivastava, learned counsel for the respondent nos.1
& 2. Perused the record.
7.     The accident is not in dispute. The issue of negligence has been
decided in favour of the appellants herein. The Insurance Company
has not challenged the liability imposed on it by the Tribunal. The
only issued to be decided is the quantum of compensation.
8.     This is a claimants appeal, claiming enhancement of award for
the death of a child who was 07 years of age at the time of his death.
Learned counsel for the appellants has submitted that deceased was a
brilliant student and he had very bright future. This aspect is not
considered by the Tribunal. It is also submitted by learned counsel for
the appellants that the notional income of the deceased is taken
Rs.15,000/- per annum by the Tribunal. It is next submitted that
learned Tribunal has held that the contribution of the deceased
towards his family was only assumed as 1/2 of his income and in this
way the Tribunal has awarded only 1/2 of his income as
compensation, which is not just and proper.
9.     Per contra, learned counsel for the Insurance Company has
submitted that the compensation awarded by the Tribunal is just and
proper and the judgment and award passed by Tribunal also does not
suffer from any such infirmity or illegality which may call for any
this court.
10.    The learned counsel for the appellants has contended that the
award is bad and relied on decision of this Court and Apex Court in
Kishan Gopal and another v. Lala and others, 2013 (101) ALR 281
(SC) = 2013 (131) AIC 219 = 2014 (1) AICC 208 (SC) and Manju
Devi's case, 2005 (1) TAC 609 = 2005 AICC 208 (SC) relied by this
Court in its recent decision of this Court in United India Insurance
Company Limited. Vs. Mumtaz Ahmad and Another, 2017 (2) AICC
"6. Sri Ram Singh has heavily relied on the decision in the case of
Kishan Gopal and another v. Lala and others, 2013 (101) ALR
281 (SC) = 2013 (131) AIC 219 = 2014 (1) AICC 208 (SC) and
Manju Devi's case, 2005 (1) TAC 609 = 2005 AICC 208 (SC). It
goes without saying the notional figure fixed by the Apex Court
since Manju Devi's judgment has been consistently Rs.2,25,000 for
children below the age of 15 years. I think that is just and proper
and hence, the amount requires to be enhanced from Rs.1,57,000
to Rs.2,25,000 with 6% be recovered from the owner. The appeal is
partly allowed. The cross-objection is also partly allowed."
11.    The judgment of Kisan Gopal (Supra) cannot be made
applicable to the facts of this case as in this case the apex court did not
deduct any amount towards personal expenses.
12.    Recently, the Hon’ble Apex Court has decided the controversy
ans settled the law regarding the death of a child in Kurvan Ansari @
Kurvan Ali and another Vs. Shyam Kishore Murmu and another,
2021 (4) TAC 673 (Supreme Court). In this case, the Hon’ble Apex
Court has stated that in spite of repeated directions, Scheduled-II of
Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 is not yet amended. Therefore, fixing
notional income of Rs.15,000/- per annum for non earning members is
not just and reasonable. It is further stated by the Apex Court that in
view of the judgments in the cases of Puttamma and others Vs. K.L.
Narayana Reddy and another, 2014 (1) TAC 926 and Kishan Gopal
and another v. Lala and others, 2013 (4) TAC 5. It is a fit case to
increase the notional income by taking into account the inflation,
devaluation of the rupees and cost of living.
13.      With the aforesaid observations, the Hon’ble Apex Court took
the notional income of the deceased at Rs.25,000/- per annum, hence
we are of the considered view that notional income of the deceased
must be assumed Rs.25,000/- per annum as he was non-earning
member. Accordingly, when the notional income is multiplied with
applicable multiplier ‘15’ as prescribed in Scheduled-II for the claims
under Section 163-A of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988, it comes to
Rs.3,75,000/- towards loss of dependency. The appellant nos.1 & 2
are also entitled to a sum of Rs.40,000/- each towards filial
consortium and Rs.15,000/- funeral expense. Hence, the appellant
nos.1 and 2 are entitled to the following amount towards
(i) Loss of Dependency : 25,000/- X 15 = Rs.3,75,000/-
(ii) Filial consortium : 40,000/- X 2 = Rs.80,000/-
14.      We hold that in view of the latest decision of the Apex Court in
National Insurance Co. Ltd. Vs. Mannat Johal and Others, 2019 (2)
T.A.C. 705 (S.C.), the appellant nos.1 and 2 shall be entitled to the
rate of interest as 7.5% per annum from the date of filing the claim
15.      In view of the above, the appeal is partly allowed. Judgment
and award passed by the Tribunal shall stand modified to the aforesaid
extent. The respondent-Insurance   Company shall deposit the amount
within a period of 08 weeks from today with interest at the rate of
7.5% from the date of filing of the claim petition till the amount is
deposited. The amount already deposited be deducted from the
amount to be deposited.
