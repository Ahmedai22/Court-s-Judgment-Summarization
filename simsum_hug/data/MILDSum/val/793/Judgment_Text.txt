17. Learned counsel for the applicant has stated that the
applicant has been falsely implicated in the matter. The money
recovered from his possession is his genuine and hard earned
money. Learned counsel for the applicant has further placed

private practice.

K.G.M.U., Lucknow. In case, the applicant is released on

19. Per contra, Sri Dharmendra Pratap Singh, Advocate holding
brief of Sri Anurag Kumar Singh, learned counsel for the C.B.I.
has vehemently opposed the anticipatory bail application on the
ground that the accused has not appeared in court on summons.

warrants have been issued against the applicant. The sanction
for prosecution has already been received and the charge-sheet
has been filed in court.
20. Learned counsel for the CBI has further stated that the
applicant is a radio therapist and in the said field of radio
therapy, no private practice is ever seen. The said field is a
specialized field and is undertaken in large Institutions and the
set up required for practicing in radio therapy goes to the tune
of multi crores.
21. Learned counsel for the applicant has failed to accord any
tenable explanation for the recovered amount. He has further
argued that the applicant is not authorized to take private
practice as he is employed in a Government institution.
22. The Apex Court in para 92.3 and 92.4 of Sushila Aggarwal
and Others vs. State (NCT of Delhi) and Another reported in
"92.3. .....................While considering an application (for grant of anticipatory bail) the
court has to consider the nature of the offence, the role of the person, the likelihood of his
influencing the course of investigation, or tampering with evidence (including
intimidating witnesses), likelihood of fleeing justice (such as leaving the country), etc.
The courts would be justified - and ought to impose conditions spelt out in Section
437(3), Cr. PC [by virtue of Section 438(2)]. The need to impose other restrictive
conditions, would have to be judged on a case-by-case basis, and depending upon the
materials produced by the State or the investigating agency. Such special or other
restrictive conditions may be imposed if the case or cases warrant, but should not be
imposed in a routine manner, in all cases. Likewise, conditions which limit the grant of
anticipatory bail may be granted, if they are required in the facts of any case or cases;
however, such limiting conditions may not be invariably imposed.
92.4. Courts ought to be generally guided by considerations such as the nature and
gravity of the offences, the role attributed to the applicant, and the facts of the case, while
considering whether to grant anticipatory bail, or refuse it. Whether to grant or not is a
matter of discretion; equally whether and if so, what kind of special conditions are to be
imposed (or not imposed) are dependent on facts of the case, and subject to the discretion
23. In the case of P.S. Kirupanandhan Vs State, Cri. A. No.
381 of 2017 and Cri MP No. 8256 of 2017, the Hon'ble Madras
High Court has rejected the submissions made by the
accused/applicant and decided that in DA cases, the explanation
offered by the accused must be supported with valid
documentary evidences. Hence, the explanation/argument of the
accused/other person cited in defence is not tenable/valid and
lawful. The arguments tendered on behalf of the applicant are
not based on concrete facts but are vague and general. The case
is not fit for the anticipatory bail.
24. The medical practitioner administer an oath at the time of
convocation as provided by Indian Medical Association which
is an extension of Hippocratic oath taken the world over. The
oath is not merely a formality. It has to be observed and
followed in letter and spirit. It is on these lines that the apex
medical education regulator, National Medical Commission has
suggested that the Hippocratic oath be replaced by 'CHARAK
SHAPATH' during the convocation ceremony for graduates in
medical services. The medical and legal fields are more a
service than a profession especially the stream of oncology
which deals with life and death.
25. Corruption is a termite in every system. Once it enters the
system, it goes on increasing. Today, it is rampant and has
become a routine. Corruption is root cause of all the problems,
such as poverty, unemployment, illiteracy, pollution, external
threats, underdevelopment, inequality, social unrest. The
menace has to be put to account. The offence is against the
society. The Court has to balance the fundamental rights of the
accused to the legitimate concerns of the society at large vis-a-
vis the investigating agency.
26. The task of the Court is manifold. Firstly, it has to ensure
that there is no unwarranted misuse or abuse of process to
encroach upon life and liberty of the applicant as enshrined
under Article 21 of the Constitution. Secondly, it has to seen
that the Rule of law is followed and the administration of
justice is not hampered, the guilty is brought to book.
27. In view of the above, the present anticipatory bail
application is dismissed.
