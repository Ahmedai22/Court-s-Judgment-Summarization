The present application has been filed for review of the order
dated 27.04.2022 on the ground that there is an error apparent on the record
as real facts were not put forth before this Court.
It is apt to notice that the present application for review has
been filed by a counsel who was neither the filing counsel nor the arguing
counsel. A perusal of the order dated 27.04.2022 would reveal that the
counsel appearing on behalf of the petitioner had not pressed the revision
petition on merits and had also made a statement that he would withdraw the
appeal pending before the Appellate Authority against the eviction order
dated 02.12.2021 and further that he is willing to pay the entire arrears of
rent and future rent/compensation for use and occupation of the premises in
case he is granted a period of 09 months for vacating the same since he is
running his shop in the said premises since 1973.
RA-CR-38-2022 and
Mr. Rahul Rampal, Advocate, who was present in Court,
accepted notice on behalf of the respondents. On instructions from the
respondents, he stated that the respondents have no objection in giving 09
monthsâ€™ time to the petitioner to vacate the premises provided that the entire
arrears be cleared within a period of 15 days and the future
rent/compensation for use and occupation was paid by the 10th of every
month. In view of the statements made by the learned counsels, the petition
was disposed off.
Learned counsel for the applicant has firstly contended that he
has obtained a no objection from the earlier counsel who had appeared
before this Court on 27.04.2022. It is next contended by the learned counsel
that the error apparent on the face of the record is that certain facts were not
brought to the notice of this Court and in view thereof the order dated
27.04.2022 be reviewed and the matter be considered on merits.
In the present case, the present review application has been filed
by the counsel who was neither the filing counsel nor the arguing counsel
nor was he present at the time of passing of the order dated 27.04.2022. A
bare perusal of the order dated 27.04.2022 reveals that the revision petition
was not pressed on merits by the counsel for the petitioner and was disposed
off on mutually agreeable terms. Learned counsel for the applicant has
contended that he has taken no objection from the earlier counsel. However,
the same would not suffice inasmuch as the petition was disposed off on the
RA-CR-38-2022 and
statements made by the counsel and none other than the counsel who had
made a statement on 27.04.2022 would be in a position to say what had
transpired on the said date.
Further, the Supreme Court of India has repeatedly deprecated
the conduct of the parties of changing their counsels and filing review
petitions. Support qua the same can be drawn from the judgment of the
Supreme Court passed in Om Parkash Vs. Suresh Kumar [2020(13) SCC
188] and T.N.Electricity Board & Anr. Vs. N. Raju Reddiar & Anr.
Learned counsel for the applicant has not been able to point out
any error apparent on the face of the record. The applicant by filing the
present application is wanting to resile from the statement made by the
earlier counsel and to re-argue the matter on merits, which cannot be
permitted in law. The parties are bound by the statements made by their
counsel in Court. It is not the case of the applicant that the counsel was not
authorized to made the statement. Infact the only ground of review is that
there is an error apparent on the record as the real facts were not put before
In view of the above, I do not find any merit in the present
application which is dismissed with exemplary costs of Rs.20,000/- to be
deposited with the Chandigarh Legal Aid Society.
