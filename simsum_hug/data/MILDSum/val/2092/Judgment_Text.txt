This petition is filed against the order dated 11.06.2021 of
State Human Rights Commission, Chennai in SHRC Case No.852/2019.
The complainant G.Ramesh before the State Human Rights
Commission, Chennai, is the sixth respondent in the present writ petition.
The said Ramesh is running a manufacturing unit of silver craft in the
name and style of "G.P.Silver Craft" for the past twenty years at Chennai.
He had business transaction with one Krishnamurthy doing the same
business in the name and style of "Rajammal Silver" and also with one
Sumithi Challani running a business in the name and style of
"C.R.Jewellers" on N.S.C.Bose Road, Chennai.
2.1. It is alleged that the said Krishnamurthy owed the
complainant the amount for silver weighing 111.816 kg and when the
same was demanded the said Krishnamurthy reportedly stated that he
had supplied the same to Sumithi Challani who in turn was to pay for
silver weighing 51.816 kg. It also appears that all the three had a number
of transactions which included transfer of land and also other movable
properties.
2.2. According to the complainant, he had to approach the
police on 11.10.2017 and 07.11.2017 against the said Sumithi Challani
for the outstanding amount but of no avail. On 18.09.2018, the
complainant had alleged that he was taken to the office of the Assistant
Commissioner of Police i.e the petitioner where a "Katta Panchayath" was
conducted and on 21.09.2018, when the complainant was again made to
appear in the office of the Assistant Commissioner, an undertaking letter
was forcibly taken from him. Thereafter, on 06.10.2018 the original
document and RC book of his Mercedes Benz Car was taken by the
petitioner and subsequently, the complainant realised that the petitioner
in collusion with Sumithi Challani and others had deceived him.
Therefore, he was constrained to file a complaint in SHRC 852/2019
before the State Human Rights Commission, Chennai, against the
petitioner.
2.3 The State Human Rights Commission, Chennai, held that
the petitioner as a senior police official had violated the Human Rights of
the complainant and therefore the complainant was entitled to receive a
compensation of Rs.25,000/- from the petitioner and also recommended
for departmental action against the petitioner.
2.4. Aggrieved over this order of the State Human Rights
Commission, Chennai, the present petition is filed to quash the same by
issuance of Writ of Certiorari.
3.Heard Mr.D.Selvam, learned counsel appearing for the
petitioner, Mr.S.Wilson, learned counsel appearing for the first
respondent, Ms.R.L.Karthika, learned Government Advocate appearing
for the respondents 2 to 5 and Mr.G.Murugeshkumar, learned counsel
appearing for the sixth respondent.
4. Mr.D.Selvam, learned counsel for the petitioner putforth his
submissions in which he argued that the petitioner was one of the few
meritorious officers in the State Police Force having won police medals,
cash award and medal from the Central Government for his
commendable service. It was also contended that the petitioner had never
indulged in any katta panchayath as claimed by the complainant and that
he had summoned the complainant for enquiry only on the basis of a
complaint dated 17.09.2018 against Ramesh by the said Sumithi Challani
addressed to the Joint Commissioner of Police, North Zone. In the said
complaint, he had alleged that the complainant Ramesh had threatened to
kill him if he fails to settle the amount due to the latter. It was further
contended that the petitioner being a senior police officer was aware that
civil matters have to be adjudicated legally only in the Court of law and
that he was in no manner involved to settle the money dispute between
the parties. All the allegations made against the petitioner were
unfounded and baseless and therefore, the order of the State Human
Rights Commission, Chennai, is liable to be quashed.
5.Per contra Mr.S.Wilson, learned counsel for the first
respondent contended that it was a humiliating experience in which the
petitioner acted in an unprofessional manner abusing his powers and
helping the said Sumithi Challani by procuring the original papers and
RC book of the 6th respondent's Mercedes Benz Car. According to the
counsel, this was a clear case of Human Rights Violation and therefore
State Human Rights Commission was right in ordering a compensation of
Rs.25,000/- to be paid to the 6th respondent/complainant and also to
initiate departmental action against the petitioner.
6. Mr.G.Murugeshkumar, learned counsel appearing for the 6th
respondent contended that though the 6th respondent lodged a complaint
with the police against Sumithi Challani, the police did not take action
against him and on the other hand, he was taken to the office of the
Assistant Commissioner of Police (the petitioner herein), where a "katta
panchayath" was conducted and on 21.09.2018, the 6th respondent was
once again summoned to the petitioner's office and an undertaking letter
was forcibly taken by the petitioner. According to the learned counsel for
the 6th respondent, on 06.10.2018, the original documents and RC book
of his Mercedes Benz car was taken by the petitioner and thereafter only
he realised that the petitioner in collusion with the Sumithi Challani and
others had deceived him. He relied on the decision of the Hon'ble Apex
Court in Lalita Kumari vs. Govt. of U.P. & others reported in (2014) 2
SCC 1 and contended that the registration of FIR is mandatory under
Section 154 Cr.P.C., if the information discloses commission of a
cognizable offence and no preliminary inquiry is permissible in such a
situation. He further contended that the police without registering any
FIR had arbitrarily conducted a "katta Panchayath" and forcibly taken
the RC book and other records of Mercedes Benz car belonging to the 6th
respondent and thus the petitioner had violated his human rights.
7 .The subject of Human Rights Violation is such a sensitive
one wherein careful scrutiny and analysis have to be done before holding
that there has been an instance of Human Rights Violation. Human
Rights Violation includes arbitrary deprivation of life; torture, cruel or
degrading treatment or punishment; slavery and forced labour; arbitrary
arrest or detention; arbitrary interference with privacy; war propaganda;
discrimination ; and advocacy of racial or religious hatred. Keeping in
mind these aspects, if we go into the contents of the complaint dated
23.01.2019 by Mr.Ramesh addressed to the State Human Rights
Commission it can be easily deciphered that there had been four to five
players in a series of transactions involving transactions in cash and in
kind. It is true that the complainant Ramesh had supplied silver lamps
(Kutthu Vilakku) to C.R.Jewellers owned by Sumithi Challani through
one Krishnamurthy and at one point of time since payment got stuck had
stopped supplying them. In such circumstances, the complainant Ramesh
had also faced pending payment issue with Krishnamurthy who also used
to buy silver lamps from him. It was then the complainant came to know
that out of the 111.816 kg silver products procured by the said
Krishnamurthy, 51.816 kg was supplied to C.R.Jewellers by the said
Krishnamurthy and therefore in lieu of the payment of the remaining 60
kg of silver articles he had offered 55 cents of land in Kolathur in his
name through a power of attorney and got it registered. According to the
complainant, subsequently, he along with the said Krishnamurthy went to
the residence of Sumithi Challani demanding the payment for the
remaining 51.816 kg silver when the said Sumithi Challani had promised
to settle the dues within three months. Out of this dues 20 kg of silver
were recovered in two instalments from Sumithi Challani with the help of
one Jayantilal who was the President of Madras Jewellers Association.
However, 31.816 kg silver was still outstanding for payment. Having
failed to recover the remaining silver the complainant filed a police
complaint in G1-Vepery Police Station on 11.10.2017. Again on
07.11.2017 another complaint was given in the Commissioner's office by
the complainant. What followed thereafter was the sequence of
transactions in which Sumithi Challani's father offered his Mercedes Benz
Car for Rs.22 Lakhs to square off the dues for the silver procured by
Sumithi Challani and the complainant paid Rs.8,50,000/- as the balance
amount after adjusting the dues from Sumithi Challani. The original RC
book and other related papers were also given to the complainant who
immediately transferred the car in his name. Later, he transferred the
same in the name of one M.G.Balaji, his friend, who availed a loan from
HDFC Bank, Nelson Manickam Road Branch for Rs.16,00,000/-
hypothecating the car. It is also mentioned in the complaint that in
January 2018, Sumithi Challani along with the said Krishnamurthy had
approached him stating that the Benz Car had much emotional value to
him since his grandfather had expired while he was in the car and
therefore, was ready to offer 6000 sq.ft. of land in 5 acres layout
developed by his father in Pazhayanur, Kancheepuram District awaiting
DTCP approval and in lieu of the same wanted the Benz Car to be
transferred back to his name. The complainant Ramesh who visited the
layout was impressed and willing to re-transfer the car subject to 6000
sq.ft. of land transferred to him following which an agreement dated
23.01.2018 was executed. On 10.03.2018, when the sale deed execution
for the land was enquired about by the complainant, Anandmal, the
father of Sumithi Challani cited lack of funds for the delay in DTCP
approval and also offered 9600 sq.ft of land in lieu of which he obtained
85 kg of silver bar from the complainant. An agreement for 9600 sq.ft
was also signed on 12.03.2018.
8.Subsequently, Krishnamurthy and        another Sunil also
promised the complainant that they would share the profit in silver
business and took 26 kg and 45 kg of silver bars from the complainant
for which the said Krishnamurthy executed a loan document for
Rs.28,40,000/-. He also offered a Power of Attorney for 27 cents of land
in Mathur Village, Thiruvallur District, on 24.04.2018 and got it
registered. Further, the father of Sumithi Challani, Anandmal, on
16.05.2018 took Rs.6.5 lakhs cash from the complainant through his
manager Sarangapani for the DTCP approval in lieu of which an
unregistered deed was executed. In such circumstances, on 18.09.2018
five unidentified persons claiming to be police had taken the complainant
to the Assistant Commissioner's office stating that there was a complaint
from Sumithi Challani against him for having threatened him (Sumithi
Challani) with dire consequences. It was further alleged in the complaint
that the petitioner in order to help Sumithi Challani and Krishnamurthy
took an undertaking in writing that he would wait till 21.09.2018 by
which time the amounts due to him would be settled by Sumithi Challani
and Krishnamurthy. On 06.10.2018, the RC book and related papers of
the Benz Car and other documents was also taken by the petitioner under
the promise that the dispute would be settled amicably.
9. The State Human Rights Commission, Chennai, relied on a
portion of the report of the Deputy Commissioner of Police, Flower
Bazaar District, Chennai who was deputed by the Joint Commissioner of
Police to go into the truth of the various allegations in the written
complaint made by the complainant G.Ramesh. The State Human Rights
Commission, Chennai, relied on the 'warning letter' purportedly issued to
the petitioner for indulging in the compromise between the parties along
with their advocates in his office. This warning letter (copy of which was
not attached) made the State State Humam Rights Commission, Tamil
Nadu, conclude that there was violation of human rights by the petitioner.
This was so because money dispute was a civil matter and the petitioner
had allegedly got himself into it for resolving the issue. The same report
also contains portions which reflect the character of the complainant. It
also makes reference to the fact that the complainant suffered from
mental ailment. These are relevant because for deciding 'human rights
violation' there need to be conclusive proof. There is a very thin line
between human rights violation and regular police enquiry. It can be
observed that the complainant had the habit of landing himself into
financial problems on his own volition by lending money and has been
approaching police since 2017 on several occasions. The series of
transactions reproduced from his complaint would go to prove the hasty
and irrational decisions by the complainant. He also had the habit of
approaching different police stations with different advocates and also
insisting on registering FIRs. In fact on one earlier occasion CSR
383/2018 was made in Yaanaikavuni Police Station based on his
complaint. The relevant extract of the report of the Deputy Commissioner

10. It is clear from the contents of the report that the
complainant was not a victim of human rights violation. He was neither
detained illegally nor subjected to any mental harassment or torture. He,
even otherwise, had the habit of going to police stations with such
complaints. It is also evident from the contents of his own complaint that
his debtors never disputed the amount due or refused to repay the loans.
It can also be easily inferred as to who would have threatened whom and
whether the complaint dated 17.09.2018 by Sumithi Challani against
Ramesh was true. Public visit police stations even for trivial issues of civil
nature and at times truce is arrived at the stations. Therefore, without any
allegations of harassment or threat by the police, such conclusions
regarding human rights violations as concluded by the State Human
Rights Commission, Chennai, would put the entire police force on
defence mode. The petitioner is not accused of any coercive method. The
complainant's grievances have been resolved ultimately. He was only the
creditor and the amounts due to him were settled. In such circumstances,
the decision in Lalita Kumari vs. Govt. of U.P. and Ors (cited supra),
may not apply to the facts of the present case.
11.This does not mean that there are no instances of human
rights violation in police stations. There are instances. But every instance
of a casual police enquiry cannot be termed as human rights violation.
The awareness amongst public is also lacking. They do not differentiate
between civil and criminal matters. More sensitisation of the police force
in such matter is required. Police force play a vital role in maintaining law
and order. Though they need to exercise caution while handling such
cases, they cannot be accused of human rights violation at the drop of a
hat. It may turn out to be a demoralising factor to the entire police force.
Therefore, the present case is not one which can be classified as a human
rights violation.
12. In the result, the Writ Petition is allowed and consequently
the        orders   dated    11.06.2021,    of     the  State    Human       Rights
Commission,Chennai, in SHRC Case No.852/2019, is quashed as prayed
for. No costs. Consequently, connected miscellaneous petition is closed.
