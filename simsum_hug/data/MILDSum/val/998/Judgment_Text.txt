whereby the victim 'x' was directed to be kept in Rajkiya Bal
Grih    (Balika),    Swaroop        Nagar,    Kanpur,  the   second
revisionist, who is the mother of the victim has approached
this Court by filing this criminal revision for setting aside the
aforesaid order and also for handing over the custody of 'X'
to her.
The facts that formed the bedrock of this revision are
that on 27.11.2021, second revisionist, who is the mother of
'X' lodged the FIR under Sections 363 and 366 IPC in
respect of missing of her daughter. During investigation,
victim was recovered on 16.1.2022 from Patiyali Railway
Station, Kasganj and she was produced before the Child
Welfare Committee, Kasganj where her statement was
recorded on 22.1.2022 in which she has expressed her
desire to go with her mother and also refused for her
medical examination, but the Child Welfare Committee,
Kasganj vide impugned order dated 24.1.2022 instead of
giving the custody of the victim ‘X’ to her mother, has sent
her to Rajkiya Bal Grih (Balika), Swaroop Nagar, Kanpur.
Second revisionist has filed an application before the
Child Welfare Committee, Kasganj stating therein that she is
the mother of the victim. The victim is minor aged 15 years
and she is unable to understand her pros and cons and that
she may be given in her custody. During her counselling by
the Child Welfare Committee, Kasganj, the victim has
expressed her desire to go with her mother.
However, the Child welfare Committee, Kasganj vide
order dated 24.1.2022 has directed the victim to be kept in
Rajkiya Bal Grih (Balika), Swaroop Nagar, Kanpur on the
ground that the mother of the victim is living in Delhi to

uncle and in the circumstances proper care of the victim
can be taken in her house.

presence of revisionist ‘X’, the victim before this Court.
Pursuant to the order of this Court second revisionist
is present before this Court.
Victim 'X' has also been produced before this Court by
Head Constable 75 Vikas Yadav P.N.N 062910040 and Lady
Constable 20, Sapna Kumari P.N.N. No. 212911109 of police
station Patiyali, Kasganj. Personal affidavit of Shri B.B.G.T
Murthy, presently posted as Superintendent of Police,
Kasganj has been filed, which is taken on record.
On query by this Court, the victim has expressed her
desire to go with her mother. Mother of the victim is also
willing to keep the victim with her.
The only question for consideration before this Court
is whether a victim can be kept in a protective home
against her wishes.
This issue has time and again been considered and
settled by this Court in catena of judgements.
In Kalyani Chowdhary Vs. State of U.P., 1978
Cr.L.J. 1003, a Division Bench of this Court has held that no
person can be kept in the protective home unless she is
required to be kept there either in pursuance of the
Suppression of Immoral Traffic and Women and Girls Act,
or under some other law permitting her detention in such a
home. It is admitted that the case does not fall under this
Act, no other law has been referred to. In such cases, the
question of minority is irrelevant as even a minor cannot be
detained against her will or at the will of her father in a
In Pushpa Devi alias Rajwanti Vs. State of U.P.
(1995)1 JIC 189, this Court has held that in any event, the
question of age is not very material in the petition of the
nature of Habeas Corpus as even a minor has a right to
keep her person and even the parents cannot compel the
detention of a minor against her will unless there is some
other reason for it.
Protection Home, Meerut and another, 1998 Cr.L.J.
654, a Division Bench of this Court after considering series
of judgement held that it is well settled view of this Court
that even a minor cannot be detained in Government
Protective Home against her wishes.
In Seema Devi alias Simran Kaur Vs. State of
Himachal Pradesh, 1998 (2) Crimes 168, the Himachal
Pradesh has held as under:
“There is no provision of law, which permits a
Court to give such a direction even in a case of
minors when it is against their will. Even if the
petitioner is only a minor aged about 15 years, her
wishes should be ascertained before placing her in
the custody of any person or institution. In this case,
she had categorically stated before the additional
chief judicial magistrate that she would not live with
her parents and she wanted to live with her husband
the 1st accused in the case. The additional chief
judicial magistrate should have given credence to her
wish and only directed her custody to be with the 1st
accused and not with the Nari Niketan.”
A Division Bench of this Court after considering the
provisions of the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of
Children) Act, 2015 as well as the law laid down by various
Court has referred the following question to Hon’ble the
Chief Justice for being decided by the Larger Bench of this
"(1) xxxxxxxxxxxxxx
(3) Under the Scheme of the Juvenile Justice (Care
and Protection of Children) Act, 2015, the welfare
and safety of child in need of care and protection is
the legal responsibility of the Board/Child Welfare
Committee and as such, the proposition that even a
minor     cannot    be   sent   to   Women     Protection
Home against his/her wishes, is legally valid or it
requires a modified approach in consonance with the
object of the Act ?"
The Larger Bench of this Court in the case of Km.
Rachna and another Vs. State of U.P., AIR 2021 All 109
(FB) after considering plethora of judgements of this Court
as well as other High Court, has answered the question in
the following words:
“Under the J.J. Act, the welfare and safety
of child in need of care and protection is the
legal responsibility of the Board/Child Welfare
Committee and the Magistrate/ Committee
must give credence to her wishes. As per
Section 37 of the J.J. Act the Committee, on
being satisfied through the inquiry that the
child before the Committee is a child in need of
care and protection, may, on consideration of
Social Investigation Report submitted by Child
Welfare Officer and taking into account the
child's wishes in case the child is sufficiently
mature to take a view, pass one or more of the
orders mentioned in Section 37 (1) (a) to (h).
In view of the verbose discussion as well as
considering the statements made by the victim and her
mother, this Court feels it appropriate in the interest of
justice to hand over the custody of the victim to her mother.
Accordingly, impugned order dated 24.1.2022 passed
by the Child Welfare Committee, Kasganj is hereby set
aside. The revision is allowed.
The victim is given in the custody of her mother
(second revisionist) with the condition that whenever
personal appearance of the victim is required before the
court concerned in case No. 307 of 2021, under Section
363, 366 IPC, police station Patiyali, district Kasganj, she
shall produce her in court.
