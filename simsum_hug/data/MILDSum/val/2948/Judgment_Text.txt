 For Petitioner(s)        :  Mr. Ankit Choudhary through VC
                      JUSTICE DINESH MEHTA
1.    By way of the present writ petition, the petitioners have
sought police protection.
2.    Upon perusal of the pleadings, this Court does not find any
serious threat perception to the petitioners and, therefore, there is
no   requirement    of   passing   any    order  for  providing   police
protection to them in light of judgment of Hon’ble the Supreme
Court in the case of Lata Singh Vs. State of U.P. & Anr. (AIR
2006 SC 2522), wherein it has been held that the Courts are not
meant to provide protection to such youths, who have simply fled
to marry according to their own wishes.
3.    There is no material or reason for this Court to conclude that
the petitioners’ life and liberty are at peril. There is not even an
iota of evidence to evince that private respondents (relatives of
the petitioner No.1) are likely to cause physical or mental assault
to the petitioners.
4.    If the petitioners have decided to marry, they must muster
the audacity and possess tenacity to face and to persuade the
society and their family to accept the step they have taken.
5.    In a deserving case, the Court can provide security to the
couple, but cannot lend them the support they have sought. They
have to learn to support each other and face the society.
6.    If any person misbehaves or manhandles them, the Courts
and police authorities are there to come to their rescue, but they
cannot claim security as a matter of course or right.
7.    The petition is, therefore, rejected.
8.    The stay application also stands disposed of accordingly.
9.    Needless to observe that petitioners have already moved a
representation before the Superintendent of Police, Sriganganagar.
In case the Superintendent of Police finds a real threat perception,
he will do the needful in accordance with law.
