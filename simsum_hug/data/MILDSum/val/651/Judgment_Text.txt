The present writ petition is filed in the form of Habeas Corpus
by the father of respondent No.4 seeking direction to the
respondents     for  production   of   respondent    No.4-Amaya.G.Jain
before this Court and hand-over her custody to the petitioner in the
interest of justice.
2.    It is the case of the petitioner that the petitioner and
the third respondent's marriage was solemnized on 30.06.2009 and
respondent No.4-baby girl was born out of the wedlock. The said
child was born premature and was under treatment in various
Hospitals. It is further stated that respondent No.3 had taken away
the baby girl from the petitioner's custody on 05.10.2021 and since
then the petitioner is not allowed to talk with the baby girl and
respondent No.3 is not even showing her, despite the petitioner’s
repeated request. It is further stated that respondent No.3 used to
frequently run away from her matrimonial home saying that she
was forcibly married to the petitioner and was filing false and
frivolous cases against the petitioner and his family members.
Therefore, the petitioner had left with no other option other than to
file divorce petition before the family court in M.C.No.5149/2016.
During the pendency of the trial, the petitioner and his family
members were eagerly trying to settle the issues with respondent
No.3 and as a result of the same, the divorce petition came to be
withdrawn and from there onwards, the petitioner and respondent
No.3    started  living  together   in Bengaluru.     But   once  again,
respondent No.3 has left her matrimonial home along with her
minor child, who is under treatment, putting child’s life in danger.
Thus, it is stated that the petitioner is filing Restitution Conjugal
Rights Petition under Section 9 of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955
against respondent No.3 before the family court. Therefore, the
petitioner has filed the present writ petition for the relief sought for.
3.    Respondent No.3 being natural mother of respondent
No.4-minor child filed objections to the present writ petition and
specifically contended that the present writ petition in the form of
Habeas Corpus filed against her is not maintainable and the same is
liable to be dismissed. It is further contended that the matrimonial
case in M.C.No.5149/2016 filed seeking divorce came to be
withdrawn by the petitioner. Thereafter at the intervention of senior
members of both families, the petitioner and respondent No.3
were re-united and had led matrimonial life. They were blessed with
a female child i.e., respondent No.4. Respondent No.3 submits that
the said minor child is with her and the minor child is hale and
healthy. She is growing very well and getting regular treatment in
Kathouli, which is one hour journey to reach Delhi. It is further
contended that as per Annexure-R1, the medical prescription, the
child is in safe custody of respondent No.3-natural mother of the
minor child.    This aspect of the matter is also well within the
knowledge of the petitioner and his family members and despite the
same, the petitioner willfully filed the present writ petition only to
harass respondent No.3. Therefore, sought for dismissal of the writ
4.    We have heard Sri. Anish Jose Antony, learned counsel
for the petitioner through virtual mode and Sri. Thejesh.P, learned
High Court Government Pleader for Respondent Nos.1 and 2,
Sri. Fayaz Sab, learned counsel for respondent Nos.3 and 4 through
physical mode.
5.   Sri.  Anish  Jose   Antony,   learned  counsel    for the
petitioner reiterating the grounds urged in the present petition
contended that respondent No.3-wife of the petitioner has taken
away the baby girl from the custody of petitioner illegally and she is
not allowing him to talk with his daughter and not even showing her
to him despite repeated request. Thereby, the writ petition in the
form of Habeas Corpus is maintainable in view of the dictum of the
Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Tejaswini Gaud and Others
Vs. Shekhar Jagdish Prasad Tewari and Others reported in
(2019) 7 SCC 42. It is further contended that the father being a
natural guardian of a minor child has a preferential right to claim
custody of his son in view of the dictum of the Hon’ble Rajasthan
High Court in the case of Goverdhan Lal v. Gajendra Kumar,
6.   Learned counsel would further contend that in view of
the provisions of the Juvenile Justice (Care & Protection) Act, 2015,
the best interest of the child is of paramount consideration and
should involve fulfillment of his/her basic rights and needs–socially,
physically and emotionally for overall development of the child.
Further, learned counsel for the petitioner-husband contended that
merely the statement made by the 3rd respondent-wife on oath that
the 4th respondent-child is in her safe custody since she is a natural
mother of Respondent No.4, cannot be believed and the petitioner
is not aware as to whether the child is alive or dead. Therefore, he
sought to allow the present writ petition.
7.    Per  contra,    Sri.  Fayaz  Sab,   learned  counsel    for
respondent Nos.3 and 4 reiterating the contentions urged in the
statement of objections, contended that there is no dispute
between the petitioner and respondent No.3 that they are husband
and wife and out of their wedlock, respondent No.4 was born. He
further   contended    that  though    the   husband/petitioner   filed
M.C.No.5149/2016       seeking   divorce   from    respondent   No.3,
subsequently the said petition came to be dismissed as withdrawn.
The minor child is residing with her natural mother-respondent No.3
and the present writ petition in the form of Habeas Corpus is not
maintainable. Learned counsel further contended that the petitioner
is misusing the provisions of Article 226 of the Constitution of India
by filing the present writ petition in the form of Habeas Corpus. If
at all the petitioner is really willing the custody of his daughter, he
could have approached the family court seeking custody of the
minor child under the provisions of the Guardians and Wards Act,
1890    or  under    the   provisions    of  the  Hindu   Minority  and
Guardianship Act, 1956. Instead of doing so, the petitioner is
misusing    the    provisions    of   Habeas     Corpus   and   thereby
unnecessarily troubling the minor child and respondent No.3. The
minor child is hale and healthy and she is in safe custody of
respondent No.3, who is her natural mother. The petitioner knowing
fully well all these aspects, filed the present writ petition only to
harass his wife and minor child.       Therefore, he sought to dismiss
the writ petition.
8.    The learned HCGP appearing for respondent Nos.1 and
2, contended that in view of the relationship of the parties, the child
is with her mother-respondent No.3, writ petition in the form of
Habeas Corpus is not maintainable and sought to dismiss the writ
9.     In view of the above rival contentions urged by the
parties, the only point that would arise for our consideration is:
"Whether the petitioner can maintain the writ
petition in the form of Habeas Corpus seeking
direction  to Respondent Nos.1       and   2  for
production of Respondent No.4-minor child
from the Respondent No.3 his wife, before this
10.    We have given our anxious consideration to the
arguments advanced by the learned counsel for the parties and
objections filed by respondent Nos.3 and 4. Perused the material
on record carefully.
11.    It is undisputed fact that the petitioner and respondent
No.3 are husband and wife and their marriage was solemnized on
30.06.2009. It is also not in dispute that respondent No.4 was born
from their wedlock as per Annexure-B on 23.11.2019. As per the
pleadings of the writ petition at para-8, the minor child-respondent
No.4 is with respondent No.3 who is none other than her natural
mother. It is also not in dispute that the petition filed by the
petitioner    seeking    divorce    from    respondent     No.3    in
M.C.No.5419/2016 before the family court came to be dismissed as
withdrawn. It is specifically contended by the respondent No.3 in
the objections that the petitioner and respondent No.3 were
re-united and thereafter respondent No.4 was born to them.
Respondent No.4 is hale and healthy and taking regular treatment
and is in safe custody of respondent No.3, who is her natural
mother.    The petitioner knowing fully well the said fact, has filed
the present writ petition. Though learned counsel for the petitioner
relied upon the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case
of Tejaswini Gaud and Others Vs. Shekhar Jagdish Prasad
Tewari and Others reported in (2019) 7 SCC 42, it was the case,
where the question of maintainability of a habeas corpus petition
under Article 226 of the Constitution of India for custody of a minor
was examined and it was held that the petition would be
maintainable where detention by parents or others is found to be
illegal and without any authority of law and the extraordinary
remedy of a prerogative writ of Habeas Corpus can be availed in
exceptional cases where ordinary remedy provided by the law is
either unavailable or ineffective. Admittedly in the present case, it
is not in dispute that respondent No.4 is residing with respondent
No.3 and it is not the case of the petitioner that respondent No.3
illegally detained respondent No.4 without any authority of law. It is
the fact that the petitioner and respondent No.3 both are husband
and wife and their child is in safe custody of respondent No.3. If
any grievance against respondent No.3 with regard to the custody
rights as alleged in the present writ petition, in all fairness, the
petitioner could have filed petition seeking custody of the child
before the family court. Thereby, he is misusing the provisions of
Article 226 of the Constitution of India, by filing the writ petition in
the form of Habeas Corpus.
12.   The judgment of the Hon’ble Supreme Court in the case
of Tejaswini Gaud (supra) relied upon by the learned counsel for
the petitioner, it was a case where the detention of a minor by a
person who is not entitled to his legal custody is treated as
equivalent to illegal detention for the purpose of granting writ,
directing custody of the minor child. Admittedly, the petitioner has
not produced any material documents to show that respondent
No.3 has detained respondent No.4 illegally in violation of any court
order, nor he has filed any petition seeking custody of respondent
No.4 for custody rights. In the absence of any material documents
produced, the present writ petition filed in the form of Habeas
Corpus is nothing but abusing the process of law and also with a
malafied intention to harass respondent No.3 and her daughter-
Respondent No.4, which is impermissible. Therefore, judgment in
the case of Tejaswini Gaud (supra) has no application to the facts
and circumstances of the present case.
13.   One more judgment relied upon by the learned counsel
for the petitioner is Goverdhan Lal’s case (supra), where it is
observed that the father being a natural guardian of a minor child
has a preferential right to claim custody of his son. If that is so, the
petitioner could approach the appropriate court for custody of his
child. There is no dispute with regard to the law laid down, but the
fact remains that the petitioner should have approached proper
Court without misusing the process of the Court by filing the writ
petition in the form of Habeas Corpus, which is nothing, but abusing
the process of the law and daring ride on the court, which is
14.   Learned counsel for the petitioner relied upon the
judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Nithya
Anand Raghavan -vs- State (NCT of Delhi) and another
reported in (2017) 8 SCC 454.        It was a case wherein the High
Court inter alia directed the mother to produce her daughter Nethra
and to comply with the order dated 8.1.2016 passed by the High
Court of Justice, Family Division, Principal Registry, United Kingdom
(UK), within three weeks from the date of the impugned order
therein or in the alternative to hand over the custody of the
daughter to the father within three weeks from the date of the
order. The said order was violated by the mother. In those
circumstances, the Hon'ble Supreme Court,        set aside the orders
passed by the High Court. Admittedly in the present case, there is
no such direction to the mother by any of the Courts, either foreign
Court or any Court in India directing her to hand over the child to
the petitioner, who is the father. In the absence of any orders
passed by any of the Courts, the custody of the minor daughter
with the mother, cannot be held to be unlawful. If the petitioner is
really aggrieved, he has to invoke the provisions of Guardians and
Wards Act, for the proper relief. In the present case, the petitioner
is misusing the powers of this Court by filing the present writ
petition under Article 226 of the Constitution of India seeking writ
of habeas corpus. Therefore, the judgment relied upon by the
learned counsel for the petitioner has no application to the facts
and circumstances of the present case.
15.   The judgment in the case of Nithya Anand Raghavan
stated supra has also been considered by the Hon'ble Supreme
Court in the latest judgment in the case of Yashita Sahu -vs-
State of Rajasthan (AIR 2020 SC 577), wherein the Hon'ble
Supreme Court held that the parent who is denied custody of the
child is entitled to sufficient visitation rights for social, physical and
psychological contact of child with any of the parent.
16.   It is well settled law that presenting a petition for
Habeas Corpus is for the person for whose release the petition is
filed, must be in "detention". He must be under detention by the
authorities or by any private individual. It is the “detention” legal
or illegal which gives the cause of action for maintaining the writ of
Habeas Corpus.      If the averments in the writ petition read as a
whole do not disclose the detention, in other words, there is no
allegation of illegal detention, the writ petition is liable to be
rejected in limine. The principles of Order VII Rule 11 of CPC
equally apply to a writ of Habeas Corpus. However, in the case of
minor girls, or young women who are kidnapped by persons in the
business of trafficking in women for the purpose of forcing them to
prostitution, may be the parents would not be in a position to
specifically give the details of the persons who have detained them
or they may not be knowing the reason for missing of their wards.
In such cases, on that ground the relief cannot be denied. It would
be an exception to the aforesaid rule. The material on record clearly
depicts that in the course of investigation, it is found that
respondent No.4 is in lawful custody of her mother, natural
17.   In view of the above, the act of the petitioner is nothing
but an attempt to overreach the Court and is nothing, but an
attempt to mislead the police. It is our experience that this type of
frivolous writ petitions in the recent days is on the rise. Because it
is a Habeas Corpus writ petition and the personal liberty of a citizen
is involved, this Court being the Constitutional Court has to reach
out to the rescue of those innocent people. We are giving top
priority to those cases. We are putting pressure on the Police to
investigate and secure and release these persons. But we find from
our experience that in most of the cases, there is no cause much
less sufficient cause for the parties to approach this Court. Litigants
and members of the Bar appear to have not understood the
importance and seriousness of this extraordinary writ of Habeas
Corpus. It is high time that we have to send a clear message that
the Courts will not encourage such litigants and tolerate such abuse
of the judicial process.
18.   In the present case, admittedly the petitioner and
respondent No.3 are husband and wife and the writ petition filed by
the petitioner seeking divorce from his wife came to be dismissed
as withdrawn.     It is also not in dispute that out of their wedlock,
baby girl was born and the said minor child is naturally with the
custody of respondent No.3-Mother. As stated in the objections filed
by respondent Nos.3 and 4, knowing fully well that the minor child
is in safe custody of her mother, the petitioner filed the present writ
petition in the form of Habeas Corpus for the relief sought for
unnecessarily     wasting    public    precious    judicial   time    and
unnecessarily misusing police force, which is meant to protect the
people. Thereby, the petitioner instead of approaching proper and
appropriate court for custody of his minor child, has misused the
State machinery as well as approached this Court knowing fully well
that his daughter is safe, hale and healthy with his wife.           It is
nothing but the abuse of the judicial process.              Thereby, the
petitioner is not entitled for the relief sought in the petition and the
writ petition in form of Habeas Corpus is liable to be dismissed with
19.   Sri   Anish  Jose   Antony,    learned   counsel    for   the
petitioner-husband contended that merely the statement made by
the 3rd respondent - wife on oath that the 4th respondent - child is
in her safe custody since she is a natural mother of Respondent
No.4, cannot be believed and the petitioner is not aware as to
whether the child is alive or dead. The said contention cannot be
accepted because the petitioner has not filed any rejoinder to the
present writ petition. Moreover, the very writ petition filed for writ
of Habeas Corpus, is not maintainable as already stated by us.
20.    Our view is fortified for the dictum of the Hon’ble
Supreme Court in the case of KISHORE SAMRITE vs. STATE OF
UTTAR         PRADESH         AND        OTHERS        reported    in
MANU/SC/0892/2012 : (2013)2 SCC 398, Para-32, 32.1 to
“32. The cases of abuse of process of court and such
allied matters have been arising before the courts
consistently. This Court has had many occasions where
it dealt with the cases of this kind and it has clearly
stated the principles that would govern the obligations
of a litigant while approaching the court for redressal of
any grievance and the consequences of abuse of
process of court. We may recapitulate and state some
of the principles. It is difficult to state such principles
exhaustively    and   with  such    accuracy   that  would
uniformly apply to a variety of cases. These are:
32.1. Courts have, over the centuries, frowned upon
litigants who, with intent to deceive and mislead the
courts, initiated proceedings without full disclosure of
facts and came to the courts with “unclean hands”.
Courts have held that such litigants are neither entitled
to be heard on the merits of the case nor are entitled to
any relief.
32.2. The people, who approach the court for relief on
an ex parte statement, are under a contract with the
court that they would state the whole case fully and
fairly to the court and where then litigant has broken
such faith, the discretion of the court cannot be
exercised in favour of such a litigant.
32.3. The obligation to approach the court with clean
hands is an absolute obligation and has repeatedly been
reiterated by this Court.
32.4. Quests for personal gains have become so intense
that those involved in litigation do not hesitate to take
shelter of falsehood and misrepresent and suppress
facts in the court proceedings. Materialism, opportunism
and malicious intent have overshadowed the old ethos
of Irrigative values for small gains.
32.5. A litigant who attempts to pollute the stream of
justice or who touches the pure fountain of justice with
tainted hands is not entitled to any relief, interim or
32.6. The court must ensure that its process is not
abused and in order to prevent abuse of process of
court,   it would      be   justified even in insisting on
furnishing of security and in cases of serious abuse, the
court would be duty-bound to impose heavy costs.
32.7. Whether a public interest is involved, the court
must examine the petition carefully to ensure that there
is genuine public interest involved. The stream of
justice should not be allowed to be polluted by
unscrupulous litigants.
32.8. The court, especially the Supreme Court, has to
maintain the strictest vigilance over the abuse of
process of court and ordinarily meddlesome bystanders
should not be granted “visa”. May societal pollutants
create new problems of unredressed grievances and the
court should endure to take cases where the justice of
the list well justifies it.
21.    The Hon’ble Supreme Court in the case of P.S.R.
Sadhanantham             v.        Arunachalam,      reported   in
MANU/SC/0083/1980 : (1980) 3 SCC 141 at Para-15 and 16
“15. The crucial significance of access jurisprudence
has been best expressed by Cappelletti:
“The right of effective access to justice has
emerged with the new social rights.        Indeed, it is of
paramount importance amount these new rights since,
clearly, the enjoyment of traditional as well as new
social rights presupposes mechanisms for their effective
protection. Such protection, moreover, is best assured
to be a workable remedy within the framework of the
judicial system. Effective access to justice can thus be
seen as the most basic requirement the most basic
“human-right”    –   of  a  system    which    purports  to
guarantee legal rights.”
busybodies blackmailing adversaries through frivolous
invocation of Article 136 is chimerical. Access to justice
to every bonafide seeker is a democratic dimension of
remedial jurisprudence even as public interest litigation,
class action, pro bono proceedings, are. We cannot
dwell in the home of processual obsolescence when our
Constitution highlights social justice as a goal. We hold
that there is no merit in the contentions of the writ
petitioner and dismiss the petition.”
22.   It is well settled law that with the passage of time, it
has been realized that people used to feel proud to tell the truth in
the courts, irrespective of the consequences, but that practice no
longer proves true, in all cases. The court does not sit simply as an
umpire in a contest between two parties and declare at the end of
the combat as to who has won and who has lost, but it has a legal
duty of its own, independent of parties, to take active role in the
proceedings and reach at the truth, which is the foundation of
administration of justice. Therefore, the truth should become the
ideal to inspire the courts to pursue. This can be achieved by
statutorily mandating the courts to become active seekers of truth.
To enable the courts to ward off unjustified interference in their
working,    those   who    indulge   in immoral   acts  like perjury,
prevarication and motivated falsehood, must be appropriately dealt
with.   The parties must state forthwith sufficient factual details to
the extent that it reduces the ability to put forward false and
exaggerated claims and a litigant must approach the court with
clean hands. It is the bounden duty of the court to ensure that
dishonesty and any attempt to surpass the legal process must be
effectively curbed and the court must ensure that there is no
wrongful, unauthorized or unjust gain to anyone as a result of
abuse of process of court. One way to curb this tendency is to
impose realistic or punitive costs.
23.   For the reasons stated above, we answer the above
point in negative holding that the petitioner-father of the minor
child has not made out any ground to allow the writ petition and
has abused the judicial process. Thereby, writ petition is liable to be
dismissed imposing cost of Rs.50,000/- (Rupees Fifty thousand
only) on the petitioner payable to the Police Welfare Fund, within
one month from the date of receipt of the order.
24.   In view of the above, we pass the following:
(i)      The writ petition is dismissed as devoid of any
merits.
(ii)     The petitioner shall pay the cost of Rs.50,000/-
(Rupees Fifty thousand only) to the Police Welfare
Fund, within one month from the date of receipt of
copy of this order.
(iii) The Registrar Judicial is directed to send the copy of
this order to the Jurisdictional Deputy Commissioner
to recover the said amount from the petitioner as
arrears of land revenue, in case, petitioner fail to
deposit the same within the time stipulated.
