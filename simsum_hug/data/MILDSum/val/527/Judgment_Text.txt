Mr. Mohit Goel and Mr. Deepankar
with Mr. Vineet Rohilla and Mr.Rohit
1.     The present application has been filed on behalf of the defendants
under Order XXV Rule 1(1) of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (CPC)
seeking a direction to the plaintiff to deposit a security of Rs 8,00,00,000/-
with this Court.
2.     Notice in this application was issued on 27th September, 2019. Reply
has been filed on behalf of the plaintiff.
3.     Senior counsel for the defendants submits that in terms of the proviso
to Order XXV Rule 1(1) of the CPC, in all cases, where the plaintiff is
residing outside India and does not possess any immovable property in
India, it is mandatory for the Court to direct the plaintiff to deposit security
for payment of costs incurred or likely to be incurred by the defendant for
contesting the suit. Reliance has been placed on behalf of the defendants on
the judgments in Kiran Shoes Manufacture v. Welcome Shoes Pvt. Ltd.,
2017 SCC Online Del 6590, S.A. Brothers & Co. and Anr. v. Bartholomow
& Sons Ltd.& Ors¸ 2000 (56) DRJ 68 and Gotham Entertainment Group
LLC and Ors v. Diamond Comics Pvt. Ltd., (2010) 42 PTC 136.
4.     Per contra, the counsel appearing on behalf of the plaintiff submits
that in the proviso to Order XXV Rule 1(1) of the CPC, the word ‘shall’ has
to be read as ‘may’ and therefore, it is not mandatory for the plaintiff to
deposit security for costs with the Court in all cases where the plaintiff
resides outside India and does not own any immovable property in India.
5.     Counsel for the plaintiff has placed reliance on the judgment dated 5th
March, 2018 passed in CS(COMM) 774/2016, titled Millennium &
Copthorne International Limited v. Aryans Plaza Services Pvt. Ltd. &
Ors., wherein it has been held that the proviso to Order XXV Rule 1(1) of
the CPC shall only apply in relation to the suits, the subject matter of which
is an immovable property. In the alternative, the counsel for the plaintiff
submits that the proviso to Order XXV Rule 1(1) of the CPC has to be
interpreted in the light of sub-rule (2) of Order XXV Rule 1 of the CPC and
therefore, the deposit of security for costs is not mandatory.
6.     I have heard the counsels for the parties.
7.     Since the submissions of the counsels for both the parties revolve
upon the interpretation of Order XXV Rule 1 of the CPC, it may be relevant
to set out Order XXV Rule 1 of the CPC:
“1. When security for costs may be required from plaintiff - (1) At
any stage of a suit, the Court may, either of its own motion or on the
application of any defendant, order the plaintiff, for reasons to be
recorded, to give within the time fixed by it security for the payment of
all costs incurred and likely to be incurred by any defendant:
Provided that such an order shall be made in all cases in which it
appears to the Court that a sole plaintiff is, or (when there are more
plaintiffs than one) that all the plaintiffs are, residing out of India
and that such plaintiff does not possess or that no one of such
plaintiffs possesses any sufficient immovable property within India
other than the property in suit.
2. Whoever leaves India under such circumstances as to afford
reasonable probability that he will not be forthcoming whenever he
may be called upon to pay costs shall be deemed to be residing out of
India within the meaning of the proviso to sub-rule (1).”
8.     There is no dispute that in terms of the main provision of Rule 1(1) of
Order XXV of the CPC, the Court has a discretion for directing the plaintiff
to deposit security for costs in view of the use of the word ‘may’. However,
the proviso to Order XXV Rule 1(1) has been the subject matter of various
judgments passed by the Coordinate Benches of this Court.
9.     In S.A. Brothers (supra), another Coordinate Bench of this Court held
that the proviso to Order XXV Rule 1(1) of the CPC is mandatory in terms.
The relevant observations of the court in S.A. Brothers (supra) are set out
“A perusal of its provisions suggests that it was mandatory in terms.
This is apparent from the use of expression "shall be made in all
cases" occurring therein. The provision prescribes only two
requirements for passing such an order, viz.,(i) where plaintiff resided
outside India and (ii) where it was not possessed of any sufficient
immovable property within India. From this it becomes clear that Trial
Court had no option but to pass an order asking for security of costs
from plaintiff where it found that he was residing outside India and
was not possessing sufficient immovable property within India. It
could not divert to examination of any other issue, including prima
facie evaluation of rival claims/counter claims for passing such an
order.”
10.    In Alberto-Culver USA Inc. v. Nexus Health & Home Care (P) Ltd.¸
ILR (2010) 1 Delhi 680, a Coordinate Bench of this Court observed that it is
not mandatory under Order XXV Rule 1 of the CPC to direct the plaintiff to
deposit security for costs in every case. The Court has to exercise discretion
as per the facts and circumstances of each case. The relevant observations of
the Court are set out below:
28. From the provisions of Order XXV it appears that at any stage of
the suit, the court after assigning reason may direct any security to be
deposited for payment of costs, if incurred or likely to be incurred by
the defendant and pass such order if the plaintiff does not reside and
possess any immovable property within India other than the property
in the suit.
29. It is clear from the said provision that it is not a mandatory
provision that in every case of such a nature, the court must direct
the plaintiff to furnish security for costs. The mandate of this
provision is that if the court is satisfied that there is no resource to
recover the cost incurred and Likely to be incurred by defendant in
the facts and circumstances of a particular case, it can pass the
orders to the plaintiff for furnishing security. The court has to
exercise its discretion as per the merit and circumstances of each
case.
11.    In Gotham Entertainment Group (supra), another Coordinate Bench
of this Court relying upon the judgment of the Calcutta High Court in
Revlon Inc. & Ors. v. Kemco Chemicals & Ors., AIR 1987 Cal 285,
observed that under Order XXV Rule 1(1) of the CPC, the Court has the
power to exercise discretion only in respect of quantum of the amount to be
deposited by the plaintiff as security for the costs to be incurred by the
12.    In Kiran Shoes (supra), another Coordinate Bench of this Court
observed that the proviso to Order XXV Rule 1(1) of the CPC is mandatory.
The Court while referring to the judgment passed by another Coordinate
Bench of this Court in Alberto-Culver (supra) also observed that the said
judgment does not address the language of the proviso to Order XXV Rule
1(1) of the CPC and also does not take into consideration the earlier decision
of the Coordinate Bench of this Court in S.A. Brothers & Co. (supra). The
relevant observations of the court are set out below:
“11. The plaintiff is a foreign entity and it is admitted that plaintiff
does not have any immovable assets in this country. Although it is
stated that the plaintiff has a large turnover in India, it is not disputed
that the plaintiff does not have a bank account in India. In these
circumstances, the apprehension of the defendants that it would be
difficult for the defendants to recover the costs, if any, that may be
awarded in its favour is merited.
12. The question whether the proviso to Order XXV Rule 1 of the CPC
is mandatory or not must be considered in the context of the express
language and the object of the said proviso. The rationale of the said
proviso is clearly to ensure that the defendant is not put to any
inordinate inconvenience of enforcing the award of costs in another
jurisdiction. The use of the word shall also indicates that the proviso
is mandatory.”
13.    In Millennium & Copthorne (supra), yet another Coordinate Bench
of this Court while referring to the judgments in Gotham Entertain Group
(supra), S.A. Brothers (supra), Kiran Shoes (supra) and Alberto-Culver
USA (supra), came to the conclusion that the proviso to Order XXV Rule
1(1) of the CPC would apply only in cases where the subject matter of the
suit is an immovable property and the same would not apply in a suit where
the subject matter is an ‘intellectual property’. The relevant observations of
the Court in Millennium & Copthorne (supra) are set out below:
“41. While in the judgments cited by the counsel for the plaintiff,
it has been held that where on a reading of the plaint, it does not
appear that the suit of the plaintiff is false and frivolous, the Court
is not bound to pass an order under Order XXV Rule 1 of the
CPC, in the judgments cited by the counsel for the defendants, it
has been held that a perusal of proviso to Order XXV Rule 1(1) of
the CPC suggests that it is mandatory in terms and where the
conditions, of the plaintiff residing outside India and not
possessing any sufficient immovable property within India, are
satisfied, the Court has no option but to pass an order asking for
security of costs from the plaintiff and the Court cannot divert to
examination of any other issue including prima facie evaluation of
rival claims/counter-claims for passing such an order. It was
however held that the mandatory language of the proviso to Order
XXV Rule 1(1) of the CPC does not take away the discretion of the
Court with respect to the quantum of the amount. In Kiran Shoes
Manufacturers supra, it was also held that Alberto-Culver USA
Inc. supra does not address the language of the proviso to Order
XXV Rule 1 of the CPC and also did not notice the earlier
decision of the Coordinate Bench in S.A. Brothers & Cos. supra.
43. A literal reading of Order XXV Rule 1 and its proviso does
initially indicate that while the sub-Rule, by use of the word „may‟,
vests a discretion in the Court whether to order the plaintiff to
give security for payment of costs or not, the proviso thereto, by
use of the word „shall‟, does not leave the Court with any
discretion where the conditions in which the proviso applies are
attracted. However, what none of the judgments aforesaid
appear to notice, is that while sub-Rule (1) refers to ‘a suit’,
whatsoever may be the claim therein, the proviso thereto refers
to ‘all cases in which the plaintiff is residing out of India and
does not possess any sufficient immovable property within India
other than the property in suit’. Such language of the proviso
conveys no other meaning than, that the same applies to cases
subject matter whereof is immovable property. Though the word
‘property’ in the expression ‘property in suit’ is not qualified by
the word ‘immovable’ but the word ‘immovable’ is found to have
been used just prior thereto and the only interpretation can be
that the expression ‘property in suit’ also refers to immovable
property in suit. Thus, the proviso applies only to cases subject
matter whereof is immovable property and not to cases subject
matter whereof is not immovable property. Admittedly, the
subject matter of the present suit is trade marks which though
generally are referred to as „intellectual property‟ but are
certainly not immovable property. The fact that the trade marks in
the present case are used in the context of immovable property
also does not make the present suit as concerning any immovable
property.
44. Seen in this light, the proviso to sub-Rule (1) of Rule 1 of
Order XXV would have no application to the present case and
the suit would be governed by sub-Rule (1) which it is not in
dispute, is discretionary.”
14.   From the discussion above, there appears to be a clear inconsistency
in the views expressed by different Coordinate Benches of this Court. On
one hand, in Kiran Shoes (supra) and S.A. Brothers (supra), it has been
observed that the proviso to Order XXV Rule 1(1) of the CPC is mandatory
in nature. On the other hand, it has been observed in Millennium &
Copthrone (supra) and Alberto Culver USA (supra) that the provisions of
Order XXV Rule 1(1) of the CPC are not mandatory in nature and the Court
has a discretion.
15.    Counsels for both the sides agree that in view of divergent opinions
expressed by different Benches of this Court and as a matter of judicial
propriety, the present matter may be referred to a larger Bench of this Court,
so that an authoritative judgment may be passed by the Court on the
interpretation of Order XXV Rule 1(1) of the CPC.
16.    Accordingly, the following questions are referred to a larger Bench of
(i)    Whether it is mandatory for the court to direct the plaintiff residing
outside India and not possessing any sufficient immovable property
within India, to furnish a security in terms of Order XXV Rule 1(1) of
the CPC for payment of costs incurred or likely to be incurred by the
defendant or whether the Court can exercise discretion in this regard?
(ii)   Whether the proviso to Order XXV Rule 1(1) of the CPC is only
applicable in respect of the suits relating to immovable property?
17.    Let the matter be placed before Hon’ble the Chief Justice for
constitution of a Larger Bench/Division Bench for consideration of the
interpretation of Order XXV Rule 1(1) of the CPC.
