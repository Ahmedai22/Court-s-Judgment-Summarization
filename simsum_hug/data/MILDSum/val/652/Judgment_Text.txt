Counsel for Revisionist :- Abhinav Gaur,Sr. Advocate,Vibhu Rai
Counsel for Opposite Party :- Rahul Mishra
1.    Heard Shri Anoop Trivedi, learned Senior Counsel, assisted by
Shri Shri Suraj Kumar Tripathi and Shri Abhinav Gaur, learned
counsels for the revisionist and Shri Rahul Mishra, learned
counsel for opposite party.
2.    Revision has been filed for setting aside the judgement & order
dated 27.04.2022 passed by the Civil Judge (Senior Division),
Allahabad in Misc. Case No. 3 of 2004 rejecting the
application/objection (paper no. 4-C) filed by the revisionist
under section 47 of CPC as not maintainable.
3.    Learned Senior Counsel submits that on 05.07.1983, an
agreement was entered in between the revisionist and opposite
party as its ancillary unit for manufacturing of fabricated items
and accessories, etc. for a period of seven years with an
arbitration clause that single Arbitrator to be nominated by the
Chief Executive Officer of the revisionist – Company, whose
award will be final and binding between the parties. He further
urged that condition of supply of contract as mentioned in the
impugned order is not correct, as such, it does not exist. The
opposite party, vide letter dated 05.05.1991, raised a dispute with
the revisionist expressing its desire for invocation of arbitral
proceedings.    Opposite party appointed one Shri Kashi Nath
Tripathi as Arbitrator on its behalf and requested the revisionist to
appoint its Arbitrator within 30 days. He further urged that vide
letter dated 18.11.1991, the revisionist intimated the opposite
party that as per clause IX(a) of the agreement, Arbitrator is to be
appointed by the Chief Executive of the revisionist – Company
and accordingly, Shri C.V. Subba Rao, General Manager of the
revisionist – Company was appointed as an Arbitrator. It was
further urged that the arbitration clause provides only
appointment of sole Arbitrator and as such, the proposal to
appoint Shri Kashi Nath Tripathi as Arbitrator was illegal and
against the arbitration clause. Vide letter dated 28.11.1991, the
revisionist again raised objection with regard to appointment of
Shri Kashi Nath Tripathi as Arbitrator.        On 01.11.1991, the
opposite party filed its claim before its own Arbitrator, Shri Kashi
4. He further urged that vide award dated 01.01.1992, the entire
claim of the opposite party was allowed without any service of
notice or opportunity of hearing to the revisionist.       Pursuant
thereto, on 04.02.1992, the opposite party made a reference
before the Civil Judge (Senior Division), Allahabad for making
the arbitral award dated 01.01.1992 as a rule of the Court, which
was registered as Suit No. 57 of 1992. He further submits that on
28.04.2003, without any notice to the revisionist, the award was
made rule of the Court. When the revisionist came to know about
the filing of Execution Case No. 6 of 2003 by the opposite party,
the revisionist filed objection dated 24.04.2004 under section 47
of the CPC, same was registered as Misc. Case No. 3 of 2004,
which has been rejected vide impugned order dated 27.04.2022.
He urged that the revision may be allowed.
5. In support of his submissions, learned Senior Counsel has relied
i) Dharma Prathishthanam Vs. Madhok Construction
ii) Sitaram Reddy Vs. Chinna Ram Reddy & others [AIR
iii) Union of India Vs. Jagat Ram Trehan & Others [1996
vi) M.P. Housing Board & others Vs. Sohanlal Chourasia
& others [ILR (2008) MP 48] (Madhya Pradesh High
v) Jaichandlal Ashok Kumar & Company Pvt. Ltd. Vs.
6. Per contra, learned counsel for the opposite party vehemently
opposed the submissions made on behalf of the revisionist.
Learned counsel for the opposite party urged that the supply
contract dated 10.04.1986 (copy of which has been filed as paper
no. 36/A-1 before the court below) has not been filed
intentionally by the revisionist. The said supply contract contains
an arbitration clause, which provides for appointment of
Arbitrator.    The Arbitrator was appointed as per the clause
stipulated in the said supply contract. Learned counsel for the
opposite party further urged that the revisionist has failed to
appoint Arbitrator on its part within a period of 30 days invoking
the provisions of section 9(b) of the Arbitration Act, 1940. The
opposite party filed its claim petition before the Arbitrator on
19.11.1991.     He further urged that the revisionist was put to
notice from the very beginning, but it chose not to participate in
the arbitration proceedings.
7. Learned counsel for the opposite party further urged that it is
wrong to state that the Arbitrator so appointed by the opposite
party has no jurisdiction. The Arbitrator, vide its order dated
15.12.1991, has rightly rejected the claim of the revisionist
relying on the supply contract dated 10.04.1986 recording the
satisfaction that despite notice, the revision chose not to appear.
He further urged that in spite of various notices having been
served upon the revisionist for fixing the dates, for reasons best
known, the revisionist had not participated in the proceedings.
Therefore, it cannot be said that the order was passed without any
opportunity of hearing to the revisionist.
8.  Learned counsel for the opposite party further urged that the
impugned order records a finding that there were documentary
evidence of notice being issued and the same has been received
by the revisionist – Company, which was neither challenged nor a
word has been whispered about the same and only bald
allegations have been made for non-service of notice. Learned
counsel for the opposite party further submits that the court
below has rightly rejected the application of the revisionist filed
under section 47 of CPC as not maintainable. Learned counsel
for the opposite party further urged that the Arbitration Act, 1940
is a complete Code in itself and the award passed by the
Arbitrator has been made a rule of the Court on 28.04.2003.
Thereafter, execution case was rightly filed, which is pending for
more than 19 years.      He further submits that Apex Court in
Special Leave to Appeal No. 4654 of 2022, vide order dated
01.04.2005, had directed the court below to decide the pending
execution case within the time framed. The learned counsel for
the opposite party has relied upon the following judgements:-
i) Paramjeet Singh Patheja Vs. ICDS Limited [2007 AIR
ii) Larsen & Toubro Limited Vs. Maharaji Educational
9.  After hearing the learned counsel for the parties, the Court has
perused the records.
10. The application under section 47 of CPC has been filed raising
objection with regard to appointment of the Arbitrator by the
opposite party. The consequential proceedings was also objected
on the ground that the Arbitrator so appointed by the opposite
party neither had any jurisdiction, nor any notice nor opportunity
was provided to the revisionist before passing an award/order.
The record shows that while passing the award, a clear-cut
finding was recorded that the notices were served upon the
revisionist, but the revisionist chose not to appear on various
dates fixed. The said findings are quoted below:-
“AND WHEREAS, on receipt of the claim, notice was
issued to the opposite party fixing 15.12.1991 for hearing of
the matter but the opposite party did not appear before me
on the date fixed. Rather a letter was received from the
opposite party challenging my jurisdiction which point was
decided by me on 15.12.1991 and the order was
communicated to the opposite party fixing 25.12.1991 for
AND WHEREAS, the opposite party did not appear before
me on 25.12.1991 also inspite of due service of notice;
AND WHEREAS on that date the claimant filed the
affidavit of Sri Harindra Singh Chopra in evidence and it
was ordered that a copy of the affidavit along with a copy
of the order-sheet be served on the opposite party fixing
AND WHEREAS, on 29.12.1991 also, the opposite party
did not appear before me inspite of due service of notice,
arguments of claimant's counsel were heard and 1.1.1992
was fixed for AWARD and notice of this date was also
AND WHEREAS, full opportunity was afforded to the
opposite party to represent its case but the opposite party
failed to appear before me till today;”
11. Further, before making the award a rule of the Court, notices were
again issued to the revisionist, but in spite of service neither any
objection was filed, nor anybody appeared on behalf of the
revisionist to make its say. The relevant part of the decree is
12. Further, the impugned order also records the service of notice
upon the revisionist, which has not specifically been denied in the
revision. The observation of the court below is quoted below:-
13. During the course of arguments, learned Senior Counsel for the
revisionist urged that after filing of the execution case, the
opposite party had tried it best to delay the proceedings. He
further urged that huge pre-payments of amount of various Banks
were outstanding against the opposite party. The Banks filed
various cases for recovery of its dues from the opposite party. In
the event the decree got executed on time, the opposite party
could not get any money as awarded by the Arbitrator. On this
count, the opposite party thought it best and very cleverly
succeeded to delay the execution proceedings.
14. Confronted with the said submission, learned counsel for the
opposite party submitted that this argument is off the record.
Learned counsel further urged that the action of the revisionist is
not fair as in spite of service of notice, at every stage, the
revisionist neither appeared before the Arbitrator, nor in the
proceedings for making the award a rule of the Court.                The
revisionist succeeded in delaying the proceedings and to further
delay the proceedings, filed objection in the execution
proceedings under section 47 of CPC.
15. The record further shows that the execution proceedings are
pending for the last 19 years.
16. Recently, the Apex Court in M/s Chopra Fabridcators &
Limited & Another (SLP (C) No. 4654 of 2022), vide order dated
“This is a very sorry state of affairs that even the execution
proceedings to execute the Award passed under the
Arbitration Act are pending for more than 20 years. If the
Award, under the Arbitration Act, is not executed at the
earliest, it will frustrate Commercial Courts Act. …....
Insofar as the present case is concerned, considering the fact
that the Award which is sought to be executed is of the year
1992 and the execution proceedings are pending since 2003,
we direct the executing court to finally decide and dispose
of the execution petition within a period of four weeks from
the date of receipt of the present order. ”
17. It has been informed at Bar that now, the Apex Court is
monitoring all pending arbitration matters/execution proceedings,
not only the State of Uttar Pradesh, but all over the country.
18. An argument was advance on behalf of the revisionist that
objection can be raised under section 47 of CPC at any stage in
the execution proceedings and therefore, the application under
section 47 of CPC has wrongly been rejected.
19. Learned Senior Counsel has relied upon the judgement in
Dharma Prathishthanam (supra).            The said judgement was
rednered in the background that a belated objection was filed with
regard to the appointment of the Arbitrator, which was not
considered. On this background, the Apex Court held that the
award passed by the Arbitrator as in nullity. But in the case in
hand, the revisionist was put to notice, but failed to appoint its
Arbitrator within a period of 30 days. Thereafter, in spite of
various dates having been fixed and service of notice upon it, the
revisionist chose not to appear.       It is not the case that the
objection raised by the revisionist was not considered or decided.
The action of the revisionist clearly reflects delaying tactics.
Therefore, the judgement in Dharma Prathishthanam (supra) is
of no help to the revisionist.
20. The learned Senior Counsel has relied upon various judgements
rendered by the Apex Court, Andhra Pradesh High Court, Delhi
High Court, Madhya Pradesh High Court and Calcutta High
Court with a view to persuade the Court that the application
under section 47 of CPC is maintainable. On the other hand, the
jurisdiction of the High Court, i.e., this Court, in Larsen &
Tourbro Limited (supra), relied upon the judgement in Pramjeet
Singh Patheja (supra), held that application under section 47 of CPC
is not maintainable, which squarely covers the issue in hand.
21. Following the judgement in Pramjeet Singh Patheja (supra), this
Court in Larsen & Tourbro Limited (supra) has observed as
16. The matter can be viewed from another angle. Section 47
CPC provides for questions to be determined by the Court
executing the decree. The said section reads as under:
"47. Questions to be determined by the Court executing
decree.- (1) All questions arising between the parties to
the suit in which the decree was passed, or their
representatives, and relating to the execution, discharge
or satisfaction of the decree, shall be determined by the
Court executing the decree and not by a separate suit.
(2)Omitted by the Code of Civil Procedure (Amendment
(3)Where a question arises as to whether any person is or
is not the representative of a party, such question shall,
for the purposes of this section, be determined by the
Explanation I.- For the purposes of this section, a
plaintiff whose suit has been dismissed and a defendant
against whom a suit has been dismissed are parties to the
suit.
Explanation II.- (a) for the purposes of this section, a
purchaser of property at a sale in execution of a decree
shall be deemed to be a party to the suit in which the
(b) all questions relating to the delivery of possession of
such property to such purchaser or his representative
shall be deemed to be questions relating to the execution,
discharge or satisfaction of the decree within the meaning
It is, thus, clear that in order to invoke section 47 CPC, there
must be a decree. Section 2 (2) CPC defines the decree. For a
decision or determination to be a decree, it must necessarily fall
within the fore-corners of the language used in the
definition. Section 2 (2) CPC defines decree to mean "formal
expression of an adjudication which, so far as regards the Court
expressing it, conclusively determines the rights of the parties
with regard to all or any of the matters in controversy in the suit
and may be either preliminary or final. It shall be deemed to
include the rejection of a plaint and the determination of any
question within Section 144, but shall not include - (a) any
adjudication from which an appeal lies as an appeal from an
order, or (b) any order of dismissal for default."
Explanation. A decree is preliminary when further proceedings
have to be taken before the suit can be completely disposed of.
It is final when such adjudication completely disposes of the
suit. It may be partly preliminary and partly final.
17. The use of words ''adjudication' and ''suit' used by
Legislature clearly goes to show that it is only a court which can
pass a decree in a suit commenced by plaint adjudicating the
dispute between the parties by means of a judgment pronounced
by the Court. The Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of Paramjeet
Singh Patheja Vs. ICDS Ltd., AIR 2007 SC - 168 after
considering the definition of decree as contained in CPC in
paragraph 29 has held that "it is obvious that an arbitrator is not
a Court, an arbitration is not an adjudication and, therefore, an
award is not a decree". Again in paragraph 31, it has been held
that words ''decision', and ''Civil Court' unambiguously rule out
an award by arbitrators to be a decree. In the said case, the
Hon'ble Apex Court while considering the question as to
whether an insolvency notice under Section 9 of the Presidency
Town Insolvency Act, 1909 can be issued on the basis of an
arbitration award, held that such notice cannot be issued for the
reason the arbitration award is neither a decree nor an order for
payment within the meaning of Section 9(2) of the Insolvency
Act and it is not rendered in a suit. Thus, the award not being
covered under the definition of a decree, objection with respect
to its validity can only be raised as provided under Section 34 of
the Act and not by taking resort to section 47 C. P. C.
22.   The Arbitration Act, 1940 is self-contained, complete code and
section 17 thereof is in pari-materia with section 36 of the
Arbitration & Conciliation Act, 1996.              Section 20 thereof,
provides for challenging the appointment of an Arbitrator. The
revisionist never challenged appointment of the Arbitrator under
section 20 thereof. Sections 30/33 and 37 of the Arbitration Act,
1940, read with Article 119 of the Limitation Act, give provision
for an application to be filed within 30 days of notice of award;
however, no such application within the said period was filed by
the revisionist.
23.   The arbitration award by way of friction is executed as decree,
but it is not a decree as defined under section 2(2) of CPC and
therefore, the objection under section 47 of CPC, which was filed
only in execution of decree (as defined under section 2(2) CPC),
is not maintainable in the proceedings seeking execution of
award.
24.   Upon evaluation of the submissions urged by the learned counsel
for the parties, the material on record as well as the law laid down
by various Courts, this Court does not find any good ground to
interfere with the impugned order.
25.   The revision fails and it is, accordingly, dismissed.
