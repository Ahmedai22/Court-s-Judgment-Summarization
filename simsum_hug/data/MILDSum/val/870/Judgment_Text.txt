Counsel for Opposite Party :- G.A.
Heard learned counsel for the applicant, learned A.G.A. for the
State and perused the record.
This Application U/s 482 Cr.P.C. has been filed with a prayer to
quash the entire criminal proceeding of Special S.T. No. 187 of
2020 U/s 323, 504 and 506 I.P.C. and Section 3(1)(D), Dha
SC/ST Act, P.S. Naini, District Prayagraj pending before
learned Special Judge SC/ST Act, Allahabad (Prayagraj) arising
out of Case Crime No. 0223 of 2020 U/s 323, 504, 506 I.P.C.
Prayagraj alongwith charge-sheet dated 09.07.2020 submitted
by the police against the applicant for the offence as well as
cognizance order dated 2.12.2020 passed by learned Special
In Girish Kumar Suneja v. CBI, (2017) 14 SCC 809, three
Judge Bench of Hon'ble Apex Court has made following
"21. The concept of an intermediate order was further elucidated in
Madhu Limaye v. State of Maharashtra by contradistinguishing a final
order and an interlocutory order. This decision lays down the principle
that an intermediate order is one which is interlocutory in nature but when
reversed, it has the effect of terminating the proceedings and thereby
resulting in a final order. Two such intermediate orders immediately come
to mind—an order taking cognizance of an offence and summoning an
accused and an order for framing charges. Prima facie these orders are
interlocutory in nature, but when an order taking cognizance and
summoning an accused is reversed, it has the effect of terminating the
proceedings against that person resulting in a final order in his or her
favour. Similarly, an order for framing of charges if reversed has the effect
of discharging the accused person and resulting in a final order in his or
her favour. Therefore, an intermediate order is one which if passed in a
certain way, the proceedings would terminate but if passed in another
way, the proceedings would continue.
22. The view expressed in Amar Nath and Madhu Limaye was followed in
K.K. Patel v. State of Gujarat wherein a revision petition was filed
challenging the taking of cognizance and issuance of a process. It was
It is now well-nigh settled that in deciding whether an order challenged is
interlocutory or not as for Section 397(2) of the Code, the sole test is not
whether such order was passed during the interim stage (vide Amar Nath
v. State of Haryana, Madhu Limaye v. State of Maharashtra, V.C. Shukla v.
State through CBI and Rajendra Kumar Sitaram Pande v. Uttam. The
feasible test is whether by upholding the objections raised by a party, it
would result in culminating the proceedings, if so any order passed on
such objections would not be merely interlocutory in nature as envisaged
in Section 397(2) of the Code. In the present case, if the objection raised
by the appellants were upheld by the Court the entire prosecution
proceedings would have been terminated. Hence, as per the said standard,
23. We may note that in different cases, different expressions are used for
the same category of orders—sometimes it is called an intermediate order,
sometimes a quasi-final order and sometimes it is called an order that is a
matter of moment. Our preference is for the expression "intermediate
order" since that brings out the nature of the order more explicitly."
From the perusal of the prayer made by applicant, it is clear that
applicant has prayed to quash the cognizance order dated
2.12.2020 passed by learned Special Judge SC/ST Act,
Allahabad (Prayagraj) which reads as follows:
In Re: Provision of Section 14a of SC/ST (Prevention of
Atrocities) Amendment Act, 2015, full Bench of this Court has
"B. Whether in view of the provisions contained in Section 14-A of the
Amending Act, a petition under the provisions of Article 226/227 of the
Constitution of India or a revision under Section 397 of the Code of
Criminal Procedure or a petition under Section 482 Cr.P.C., is
maintainable. OR in other words, whether by virtue of Section 14-A of the
Amending Act, the powers of the High Court under Articles 226/227 of the
Constitution or its revisional powers or the powers under Section 482
We therefore answer Question (B) by holding that while the constitutional
and inherent powers of this Court are not "ousted" by Section 14A, they
cannot be invoked in cases and situations where an appeal would lie
under Section 14A. Insofar as the powers of the Court with respect to the
revisional jurisdiction is concerned, we find that the provisions of Section
397 Cr.P.C. stand impliedly excluded by virtue of the special provisions
made in Section 14A. This, we hold also in light of our finding that the
word "order" as occurring in sub-section(1) of Section 14A would also
Perusal of the record reveals that applicant has also prayed to
quash cognizance order dated 2.12.2020 passed by Special
Judge SC/ST Act, Allahabad (Prayagraj) by which learned
Special Judge SC/ST Act has summoned the applicant to face
the trial U/s 323, 504 and 506 I.P.C. and Section 3(1)(D), Dha
SC/ST Act to face the trial.
In Girish Kumar Suneja v. CBI (Supra), Honble Apex Court in
para 21 has specifically stated referring the judgement of
Madhu Limaye Vs. State of Maharashtra (1997) 4 SCC 551
that taking cognizance of an offence and summoning the
accused is intermediate order, thus impugned cognizance order
dated 2.12.2020 is an intermediate order.
Now it is to be seen whether Application U/s 482 Cr.P.C. lies
against the impugned cognizance order dated 2.12.2020 or
appeal will lie under Section 14A(1) of the S.C./S.T. Act.
Relevant portion of Section 14A(1) of the S.C./S.T. Act. are
"14A. Appeals.- (1) Notwithstanding anything contained in the
Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (2 of 1974), an appeal shall
lie, from any judgment, sentence or order, not being an
interlocutory order, of a Special Court or an Exclusive Special
Court, to the High Court both on facts and on law."From the
perusal of provisions of Section 14A(1) of the Scheduled Castes
and the Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities Act), 1989, it
is clear that an Appeal shall lie from any judgement,
cognizance order, order not being interlocutory order of Special
Court, or an exclusive Special Court to the High Court, both on
Full Bench of this Court in Re: Provision of Section 14a of
SC/ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Amendment Act, 2015 while
answering question B has specifically stated- "we hold also in
light of our finding that the word "order" as occurring in sub-
section(1) of Section 14A would also include intermediate
Thus if any intermediate order is passed by Special Court or an
exclusive Special Court in case relating to an offence in the
S.C./S.T. Act, that will come in the category of order as
provided under Section 14A(1) of SC/ST Act against which
only an appeal shall lie before the High Court, both on facts and
on law.
In view of the above discussion, I am of the considered opinion
that Application U/s 482 Cr.P.C. cannot be filed against
cognizance order dated 2.12.2020 passed by learned Special
This Application U/s 482 Cr.P.C. is disposed of with the
observation that revisionist is permitted to file fresh petition
before the appropriate forum.
