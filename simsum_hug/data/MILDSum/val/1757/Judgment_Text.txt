The present petition has been filed by the petitioners herein
who are aggrieved by the order dated 21.3.2014 passed by the Court
of the learned 10 Additional Sessions Judge, Jabalpur in Criminal
Revision No.249/2013, by which the revision filed by the respondent
herein was illegally allowed and set aside the order dated 8.4.2013 of the
learned JMFC Jabalpur passed in MJC No.4/2011.
2.     The case of the petitioners is that the petitioner no.1 is the husband
and the petitioner no.2 is the father-in-law of the respondent.           The
respondent filed a case under the Domestic Violence Act against the
petitioners. In the said case, she moved an application asking the learned
Trial Court to call for the record of a “missing person’s case” being case
no.20/2010, which was registered at Police Station Belbag, Jabalpur
relating to the alleged elopement of the petitioner no.1 with another
lady. In that case the father of the lady had filed the aforementioned
missing person’s report, in which the petitioner and the lady alleged to
have appeared before the Police and handed over certain documents.
Admittedly, the details relating to the said documents are not given in the
application. The learned Trial Court vide order dated 8.4.2013 dismissed
the application filed by the respondent on the ground that the same is
vague as it is not specific of the nature and type of documents required
from the police in “missing person’s case” no.20/2010. Thereafter, the
respondent preferred a criminal revision in which the impugned order
was passed and said order set aside the order passed by the learned Trial
Court and in consequence thereof the file of the missing person’s case
no.20/2010 reached the Trial Court for the purpose of confronting the
petitioners during their testimony.
3.     Learned counsel for the petitioners submits that the impugned
order is bad in law as the same falls foul of the judgment of the Supreme
Court passed in 2009(5) SCC 153 Sethuraman Vs. Rajamanickam. The
facts in that case related to an application that was moved under section
91 Cr.P.c. and another under section 311 Cr.P.C. where the applications
after being rejected, criminal revisions were filed before the High Court,
in which the impugned orders were passed allowing the revision petition.
In paragraph 5, the Supreme Court has held that orders passed disposing
of application under section 91 Cr.P.C. and under section 311 Cr.P.C.
were orders of a interlocutory nature against which a, revision under
section 397 was not maintainable at all in view of section 397 (2) Cr.P.C.
He has also relief upon the judgment of the Supreme Court passed in
Apparels Ltd and others,          where the Supreme Court referring to
previous judgments notable amongst them being Madhu Limaye Vs.
State of Maharashta (1977) 4 SCC 551 and Amarnath Vs. State of
Haryana, (1977) 4 SCC 137, wherein the Supreme Court had embarked
upon a enquiry to lay down the distinction between an interim order,
interlocutory order and orders of an intermediate nature. In paragraph
11, however, the Supreme Court held that an objection regarding
maintainability of the revision petition should have been raised before the
Court which invoked such a revisional jurisdiction and that as the same
was not done, the Supreme Court left the question undecided.
4.     The learned counsel for the respondent on the other hand has
submitted that the application under section 91 did not survive after the
impugned order was passed by the learned Trial Court on 8.4.2013 and
the same was finally concluded and therefore, the same cannot cannot be
said to be an interlocutory order as it had finally disposed of the
application under section 91 Cr.P.C. moved by the respondent. He has
also submitted that the petitioners did not raise the jurisdictional point
before the learned Court of revision and, therefore, the learned Court of
revision also did not embark into an enquiry upon its power to exercise
the revisional jurisdiction under section 397 Cr.P.C. Lastly, he has
submitted that the petitioner has failed to show what hardship or
inconvenience or disadvantage or prejudice was caused to him.
5.     Heard the learned counsels for the parties and perused the petition
and the documents filed therewith.
6.     The contention of the learned counsel for the petitioners that they
have raised this issue of lack of jurisdiction before the learned Court of
revision, does not finds support from the impugned order.. There is no
reference by the Court of Sessions that such an argument with regard to
lack of jurisdiction was made before it and neither has it dealt with it.
Even in the petition there is no specific averment to the effect that the
point of jurisdictional error in filing the revision petition was ever raised
before the learned Court of revision. Learned counsel for the petitioners
has, however, referred to paragraph H,I and J on the grounds in order to
substantiate his argument that these points were raised before the learned
Court below. However, having gone through the said grounds it only
appears that the petitioners have referred to three judgments of the
Supreme Court, not before the Court of revision but before this Court in
order to show the error committed by the Court of revision.
7.     The order passed by the Supreme Court in (2009) 5 SCC 153
(Sethuraman      Vs.  Rajamanickam)         is  precise,  unequivocal    and
unambiguous. It has clearly arrived at the finding that orders passed on
the application under section 91 Cr.P.C. and section 311 Cr.P.C. are
interlocutory in nature barring the jurisdiction of a criminal revision.
Reasons have not been assigned in the said judgment as to why it
considers the said orders passed in such applications, as interlocutory.
However, the finding is unambiguous, unequivocal . Under the
circumstances, judicial discipline demands that this Court feels bound by
the said finding.
8.    This Court also finds it essential to examine the effect of paragraph
11 in the judgment of the Supreme Court in Bhaskar Industries(supra)
case where the Supreme Court observed that the objection regarding the
maintainability of the revision petition should have been raised before
the Court, which invoked such a revisional jurisdiction. However, it left
the question undecided. A point relating to law can be raised at any
stage. Whether or not the Court has jurisdiction to entertain a revision
against an interlocutory order, is a question of law. Though the same was
not taken before the Court of revision that it lacked the jurisdiction to
entertain the revision on account of the bar of section 397(2) Cr.P.C, it
cannot be said that the learned Court of revision ought not to have known
the law relating to the bar on entertaining the criminal revision on
account of 397(2).
9.     The contention of the learned counsel for the respondent that the
application under section 91 Cr.P.C stood finally disposed in view of the
order passed by the learned Trial Court and, therefore was not hit under
section 397 (2) is untenable. If the said argument is accepted, the concept
of a interlocutory order barring revision under section 397(2) would be
rendered otiose.     Courts dispose of applications by passing orders.
Merely because the applications stood disposed of finally cannot make
the said order a final order or an order, which is not interlocutory in
nature. The test for an interlocutory order has already been laid down
very succinctly and clearly in the judgments passed by the Supreme
Court in Amarnath Vs. State of Haryana (1977) 4 SCC 137                 and
Madhu Limaye Vs. State of Maharashta (1977) 4 SCC 551, where the
Supreme Court has held that orders which result in the termination of a
proceeding before the Court concerned, will certainly not constitute an
interlocutory order.   In Amarnath’s case, the Supreme Court further
clarified that an order disposing of an application by which a valuable
right of either of the parties is affected, would be an intermediate order
and not as interlocutory order, though the said order does not result in
the disposal of the the case itself..
10.    In this particular case, the respondent could have resorted to
another procedure available to it under the law if it felt aggrieved by the
order passed by the learned Trial Court. It cannot be said and neither has
it been demonstrated by the learned counsel for the respondent how the
dismissal of the said application grossly prejudiced the respondent in the
conduct of her case. It is not the case of the respondent that it is unable
to prove the factum of marriage of the petitioner no.1 to someone else by
any other means other than the documents in the missing persons case
no.20/2010.
11.    Under the circumstances, the petition succeeds and the impugned
order dated 21.3.2014 passed by the learned 10th Additional Sessions
Judge Jabalpur in Criminal Revision No.249/2013 is quashed and set
aside. However, the respondent is given the liberty of resorting to such
remedies available to her under the law.
12.    With the above, the petition is finally disposed of.
