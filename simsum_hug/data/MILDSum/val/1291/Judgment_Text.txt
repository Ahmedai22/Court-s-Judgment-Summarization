2. The application under Section 33(2)(b) of the Industrial
Disputes Act, 1947 (hereinafter referred to as the “ ID Act”) seeking
approval of the dismissal order dated 15.03.2018 of the workman,
was rejected on 22.05.2020, which rejection order is under
challenge in the main Writ Petition.       The present Miscellaneous
Petition is one seeking for the last drawn wages under Section 17B
of the ID Act.
3. While the petitioner-Management would submit that on
15.07.2020, the Management had ordered for reinstatement and
directed the workman to report for duty at their Puducherry factory,
the workman had failed to report and therefore, is not entitled for
the 17B wages, the learned counsel for the respondent would
submit that the last place of employment of the workman was at
Hosur, the Management had passed the order of reinstatement by
directing him to report at Puducherry, which cannot be termed as
“an order of reinstatement at all”. According to the learned counsel,
the Management is required to reinstate the workman in the original
place of employment only and the present order cannot be termed
as an “order of reinstatement” and therefore, the workman would
be entitled for 17B wages.
4. In P.D.Sharma Vs. State Bank of India reported in
AIR 1968 SC 985, the Hon'ble Supreme Court had held that when
the application under Section 33(2)(b) is rejected, then the action
taken by the employer becomes ab-initio-void and the employee will
continue in service and his conditions of service will also continue
without any break as if the order in question had not been made at
5. In the case of Lakshmi Mills, Ltd., Coimbatore Vs.
Labour Court, Coimbatore and another reported in 1997 (3)
L.L.N. 354, a Hon'ble Division Bench of this Court had held that the
term “reinstatement” would mean reinstatement to the original
place of employment.      The observation of the Hon'ble Division
Bench in this regard reads as follows:-
“12.But it remains to be seen that the
transfer would affect the employee in the matter of
getting the emoluments and reinstatement means
reinstatement to the original position. When there
is an award directing the management to reinstate
him, it is not possible for the management to say
that they will transfer him from the place where he
was originally working to a new place.”
Adhyapak Mahavidyalaya (D.ED.) and Others reported in 2013
(10) SCC 324, the Hon'ble Supreme Court had held as follows:-
“22.The   very   idea  of   restoring    an
employee to the position which he held before
dismissal or removal or termination of service
implies that the employee will be put in the same
position in which he would have been but for the
illegal action taken by the employer.”
7. The ratios held in the aforesaid decisions clearly
indicates that when the Management chooses to reinstate any of
their workmen, such a reinstatement can only be at the place of the
concerned workman's original employment, as held by the Hon'ble
Supreme Court in Deepali Gundu Surwase and P.D.Sharma's cases
(Supra).     Likewise, it will not be open to the Management to
reinstate a workman by transferring him to another place from his
original place of employment, which ratio had been held by the
Hon'ble Division Bench in Lakshmi Mills' case (supra).       When the
dismissal order itself becomes ab-initio-void in view of the rejection
of the Approval Petition, reinstating the workman by transferring
him to some other place, other than his original place of
employment, is an illegal action and totally contrary to the ratio laid
down in the aforesaid decision.
8. In this background, the present decision of the
Management to reinstate the workman by transferring him from
Hosur to Puducherry through the Transfer Order dated 15.07.2020,
cannot be deemed to be a “reinstatement order at all”. Hence, the
question of the workman not reporting for duty at the transferred
place does not arise. While that being so, the workman would be
entitled for receiving the last drawn wages under Section 17B of the
Act.   The workman has also filed an affidavit before this Court
stating that he has not been gainfully employed from the date of
rejection of the Approval Petition.
9. In the light of the above observations, there shall be a
direction to the Management to pay the workman namely, Mr.Patil
Veershetty, his last drawn wages under Section 17B of the ID Act,
commencing from 04.08.2020 (i.e.,) from the date of filing of this
Writ Petition and continue to pay the same till the final decision of
this Court in this Writ Petition.
Registry is directed to post the main Writ Petition on
