2.                This appeal challenges the order dated 20.01.2020 passed by
the               National  Consumer   Disputes   Redressal   Commission,   New  Delhi
(“National Commission” for short) in Revision Petition No.2308 of
3.                The appellant manufactures “Honda City Cars” and one such car
was purchased by respondents no.1 to 3 herein in the year 1999.
The car continued to be under their ownership and possession till
26.09.2010               when  the   car   suffered  damage   in  an   accident  which
occurred at Dabri Bus Stand, New Delhi.                    The car was taken to the
authorized service centre (respondent no.5 herein) for repairs.
The car was insured and, as such, the surveyor of the insurance
company               found  the   estimated   cost  of   repairs  at   the  level  of
Alleging deficiency on part of the appellant herein as well as
the dealer and the service centre, respondents no.1 to 3 filed
complaint                no.DF.VII/261/2011/25     before   the   Consumer    Disputes
Redressal Forum – VII, Government of NCT of Delhi (“District Forum”
for short).
5.   The matter was considered by the District Forum and insofar as
the  liability  of   the  present   appellant  is concerned,  it  was
“So far as OP-II is concerned, we find no material on
record to fasten any liability for the conduct of the
O.P.-I and O.P.-III with whom O.P.-II have allegedly only
principal to principal relationship.”
Finally, directions were issued as against the dealer and the
authorized service centre to the following effect:
“As a result of our above discussion, we direct O.P.-I and
O.P.-III jointly and severally to:
1.   Deliver the duly repaired car of the Complainants
immediately after the Complainants pay the balance
of the initially agreed amount of Rs.1,50,000/- i.e.
2.   Pay Rs.50,000/- as compensation for mental agony and
3.   And also pay Rs.10,000/- as cost of litigation.
*    Order be complied within 30 days after receipt of
the order.
*    Copy of order be supplied to the parties free of
cost.
*    File, thereafter, be consigned to Record Room.”
6.   Respondents no.1 to 3 being aggrieved preferred First Appeal
No.154  of  2013   before   the  State   Consumer Disputes  Redressal
Commission, Delhi (“State Commission” for short).     A cross appeal
being First Appeal No.202 of 2013 was also preferred by the dealer
and the authorized service centre.
7.   The  State   Commission,   by  its   judgment and  order  dated
16.03.2017, affirmed the view taken by the District Forum insofar
as the liability of the appellant was concerned as under:
“15. So far as the case of OP No.2 is concerned, it is a
manufacturing company and the complainants were not
pointed out or shown any manufacturing defect to OP No.1 &
3 at the time of delivery of the damaged vehicle for
repair.   We are in complete agreement of the finding of
the District Forum in this regard that no liability can be
fixed on OP No.2.”
As regards the liability of the dealer and the authorized
service centre, the State Commission observed as under:
“16. The District Forum has very rightly decided that OP
No.1 & 3 are guilty of indulging in unfair trade practice
for enhancing the charges of repair from Rs.1,50,000/- to
Rs.2,40,000/-.    The District Forum has rightly directed
the complainant to pay Rs.1,00,000/- to the OPs 1 & 3 who
will thereafter deliver the vehicle in good condition. As
far as grant of compensation of Rs.50,000/- for mental
agony and harassment is concerned, the same has been
awarded by the Ld. District Forum after considering the
document on record by the Ld. District Forum. The same is
not on lower side as is contended by complainant. Further
grant of compensation is discretion of Ld. District Forum.
The same has been exercised by the Ld. District Forum
after considering all the relevant material on record.
We find no reason to interfere with the same. Similarly,
the cost of litigation of Rs.10,000/- to the complainants
also cannot be said to be on lower side.         We are in
complete agreement with the finding of the District Forum
and there is no illegality or irregularity in the impugned
order dated 02.01.2013 of the District forum.”
8.   The dealer and the authorized service centre did not carry the
matter further.     However, respondents no.1 to 3 filed Revision
No.2308 of 2017 before the National Commission.
9.   The National Commission found that for some reason or the
other, the car was not repaired and every time whenever approach
was made, the estimated cost of “repairs” was at an escalated rate.
However, considering the facts and circumstances on record, the
relief was moulded by the National Commission as under:
“13. We, therefore, in the interest of justice, request
the Respondents No.1 & 2 to provide a brand new Honda City
car to the Petitioners on payment of a nominal sum of
Rs.2,50,000/-.        This would be towards the goodwill
gesture. Balance amount towards the cost of the car may
be recovered from Respondent No.3.”
10.  Being aggrieved by the liability fastened on the appellant to
provide  brand   new   Honda    car   on   payment   of   a   nominal    sum  of
Rs.2,50,000/- by respondents no.1 to 3, the appellant is in appeal
before this Court.
11.  We  have   heard   Mr.   Jagdev    Singh,   learned    Advocate   for   the
appellant  and   Mr.   K.P.    Berry,   respondent-in-person       for   and  on
behalf of respondents no.1 to 3.
12.  As  the   facts    on   record    show   that   the   car   was   used   by
respondents   no.1   to   3   for   more   than   10  years,    whereafter    it
suffered an accident.       There is not an iota of material that the
accident occurred as a result of any manufacturing defect.                    If
there be any deficiency in service by the dealer or the authorized
centre in rendering assistance for repairs of the vehicle, the
manufacturer of the vehicle cannot be held liable. The law on the
point is very clear by the decision of this Court in TATA Motors
Ltd. v. Antonio Paulo Vaz & Another, 2021 SCC Online SC 125.
13.  The  District    Forum     was,   therefore,     justified     in  passing
directions  and   making    OP   Nos.1   and  3  i.e.   the   dealer   and   the
authorized centre, liable for the deficiency on their part. The
District Forum at the same time had relieved the appellant of any
liability.   These   findings     were   rightly    affirmed    by   the   State
Commission and the National Commission ought not to have passed
direction  putting  the  burden   on  the   appellant  and  asking  the
appellant to provide a brand new vehicle as a “goodwill gesture”.
14.  We,  therefore,  allow  this   appeal,   set-aside  the  direction
issued by the National Commission in paragraph 13 of its order, but
restore the order passed by the District Forum as affirmed by the
The appeal is allowed to the aforesaid extent, with no order as
to costs.
