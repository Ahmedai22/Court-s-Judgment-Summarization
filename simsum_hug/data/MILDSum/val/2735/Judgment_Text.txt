1.      Feeling aggrieved and dissatisfied with the impugned judgment and order dated
23.02.2018 passed by the High Court of Madhya Pradesh, Principal Seat at Jabalpur in
Writ Petition No. 3190/2018, by which the High Court has dismissed the said writ petition
by holding that the original writ petitioners are not entitled to seek a writ of quo warranto,
the original writ petitioner No.1 has preferred the present appeal.
2.      Before the High Court, the original writ petitioners prayed for the following reliefs:
A.      It is, therefore, prayed that this Hon’ble Court may kindly be pleased to call the entire
record of the appointments of the Quota under limited competitive examination since 2007
and pursue it and quash the impugned order dated 19.01.2018 (Annex. P-11) and

C.      It is therefore, prayed that this Hon’ble Court may kindly be pleased to direct to the

E.      Any other relief as deemed fit and proper in the circumstances of this case, along

3.     Before the High Court, it was the case on behalf of the original writ petitioners that
despite the directions issued by this Court in the case of All India Judges’ Association
and Others v. Union of India and Others, reported in (2010) 15 SCC 170, directing all
the High Courts to fill up the posts in the higher judiciary by reserving 10% seats to be
filled up by limited departmental competitive examination, the High Court of Madhya
Pradesh has exceeded the quota and has filled up the posts in the higher judiciary beyond
10% quota. It is/was the case on behalf of the original writ petitioners that despite the
specific direction issued by this Court directing all the High Courts to see that the existing
Service Rules be amended positively with effect from 1.1.2011, the High Court of Madhya
Pradesh did not amend the rules providing 10% seats to be filled up by limited
departmental competitive examination.
4.     By the impugned judgment and order and despite the fact that the aforesaid reliefs
were prayed by the original writ petitioners, the High Court has considered that the original
writ petitioners have prayed for a writ of quo warranto. The aforesaid reliefs cannot be said
to be the reliefs of a writ of quo warranto. However, instead of remanding the matter to the
High Court, we ourselves have considered the matter and the issues on merits.
5.     Learned counsel appearing on behalf of the High Court has submitted that initially
in the year 2005, the High Court did amend the Recruitment Rules, however, the same
came to be set aside by the High Court and the matter reached to this Court and thereafter
after conclusion of the proceedings before this Court in the year 2018, the High Court
amended the Recruitment Rules in line with the directions issued by this Court in the case
5.1 Learned counsel appearing on behalf of the High Court has also further submitted that
in absence of the selected/appointed candidates, no relief can be granted by quashing
and setting aside the appointments made in excess of the quota beyond 10%.
6.     Heard learned counsel for the respective parties at length.
This Court in the case of All India Judges’ Association (supra) specifically
directed that from the date of the said judgment, there shall be 25% of seats for direct
recruitment from the Bar, 65% of seats are to be filled up by regular promotion of Civil
Judge (Senior Division) and 10% seats are to be filled up by limited departmental
competitive examination. This Court also further directed that if the candidates are not
available for 10% seats, or are not able to qualify in the examination then vacant posts
are to be filled up by regular promotion in accordance with the Service Rules applicable.
This Court also further directed that all the High Courts to take steps to see that existing
Service Rules be amended positively with effect from 1.1.2011. This Court also further
directed that if the Rules are not suitably amended, the said order shall prevail and further
recruitment from 1.1.2011 shall be continued accordingly as directed.
7.     Therefore, as per the directions issued by this Court in the aforesaid decision, on
and from 1.1.2011, only 10% seats are to be filled up by limited departmental competitive
examination. Any appointment beyond 10% seats filled up by limited departmental
competitive examination therefore shall have to be considered appointment excess in
8.     In the present case, in the year 2017, there were 740 sanctioned posts. Therefore,
74 seats were to be filled up by limited departmental competitive examination against
which 78 posts were filled up by limited departmental examination. Thereafter, further 11
posts were advertised, out of which 5 posts were filled up. The result would be that the
posts were filled up by limited departmental competitive examination beyond 10% seats
quota for limited departmental competitive examination. As observed hereinabove and as
directed by this Court, 10% seats were required to be filled up by limited departmental
competitive examination w.e.f. 1.1.2011 and any recruitment made from 1.1.2011
onwards. Therefore, the High Court has to undertake the exercise from 1.1.2011 adjusting
the posts and if any appointments are found to have been made beyond 10% seats in a
particular recruitment, the same shall have to be adjusted in future recruitment.
9.      So far as challenge to the appointments made in excess of the quota under limited
departmental competitive examination since 2007 and the appointments made in the year
2017/2018, no relief can be granted to the original writ petitioners in absence of those
selected/appointed candidates.
At this stage, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the High Court has strongly
opposed the locus of original writ petitioners by submitted that original writ petitioner No.1
– appellant herein was a suspended judicial officer who subsequently came to be
compulsorily retired. However, without further opining on the locus of the original writ
petitioners, we have considered the matter on merits in light of the decision of this Court
in the case of All India Judges’ Association (supra).
10.     In view of the above and for the reasons stated above, the present appeal stands
disposed of by directing as under:
The High Court of Madhya Pradesh is hereby directed to act as per the directions
issued by this Court in the case of All India Judges’ Association (supra), more
particularly directions contained in paragraphs 8 & 9 of the said decision and is directed
to see that 10% seats are filled up by limited departmental competitive examination on
and from 1.1.2011 and if it is found that in any recruitment subsequent to 1.1.2011, the
10% quota is breached, all such posts shall be adjusted in the future recruitments.
11.     The instant Civil Appeal stands disposed of in the aforesaid terms.
No costs.
