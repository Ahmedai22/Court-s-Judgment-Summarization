judgment.
formality.
This common order will dispose of W.P. Nos.22127/2021 &
2.      The facts are taken from W.P. No.22127/2021. The admitted facts
between the parties are that the petitioner – a borrower, obtained a loan and
intended to repay it in terms of One Time Settlement (OTS). During the
correspondence made for this purpose between the petitioner and the Bank,
the Bank issued the letter dated 09.03.2021 (Annexure A/1) to the
petitioner. In this letter, the amount of OTS was quantified as
Rs.36,50,000/- by mentioning that it is "as per settlement formula given in
the    scheme".   The    petitioner,    in    furtherance thereof,    deposited
Rs.35,00,000/- with the Bank.
3.     The petitioner is aggrieved by communications dated 25.08.2021
(Annexure P/4) and 22.09.2021 (Annexure P/13). By communication dated
25.08.2021, the Asset Recovery Branch of the Bank informed the petitioner
that the proposal of petitioner was put up before the competent authority
which has sanctioned the compromise proposal of the petitioner on certain
terms. The first term was that petitioner will be required to deposit
Rs.50.50 lakhs as full and final settlement of the dues. Aggrieved, the
petitioner preferred representation dated 13.09.2021 (Annexure P/5)
followed by communication through e-mail. The respondents, in turn, sent
another letter dated 13.09.2021 and informed the petitioner that on
25.08.2021, the petitioner was informed about acceptance of the proposal.
The Bank has neither received the petitioner's express acceptance nor
denial of the petitioner. Thus, it was presumed that the petitioner has
accepted the proposal and in turn, the petitioner was directed to deposit the
remaining amount as per OTS sanction. This was followed by another letter
of similar effect dated 17.09.2021 (Annexure P/7).
4.     Shri Wajid Hyder, learned counsel for the petitioner submits that the
petitioner sent a legal notice dated 29-01-2021 and apprised the Bank that
Bank is not justified in asking the amount over and above Rs.36,50,000/-
mentioned in communication dated 09-03-2021 (Annexure A/1). The
petitioner also sent an e-mail regarding the aforesaid stand of the petitioner.
Lastly, the respondent sent the impugned letter dated 22-09-2021 and
informed the petitioner again that OTS has been sanctioned by the
competent authority for Rs.50.50 lakhs only. The petitioner was directed to
follow up with Zonal Office, Jabalpur/ARB Jabalpur for further
clarification. It is argued that when Bank did not accede to petitioner's
request, petitioner promptly filed this petition on 05-10-2021. This petition
is filed immediately after receiving the communication dated 22-09-2021.
5.      Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that a careful reading of
the letter dated 09-03-2021 shows that the petitioner was required to pay
minimum 10% of the OTS amount within stipulated time. The petitioner
deposited Rs.35,00,000/- out of Rs.36,50,000/- within the stipulated time.
The only option left with the Bank was to proceed further after the stage of
issuance of ‘intimation letter’ and if the petitioner was eligible, issue a
‘sanction letter’. The respondents have miserably failed to accept the same
and on the contrary, decided to enhance the compromise amount to
Rs.50.50 lakhs unilaterally. This runs contrary to the OTS scheme. The
OTS scheme is binding, submits Shri Wajid Hyder, on the basis of Sardar
Associates and Ors. Vs Punjab and Sind Bank and Ors [2009 (8) SCC
257]. It is submitted that since OTS scheme is binding, the Bank could not
have enhanced the amount nor by any stretch of imagination can treat that
the offer which was duly accepted as elapsed.
6.      A Division Bench judgment of this Court reported in AIR 2007
MP114 (Laxmi Grih Udyog and Another vs State of Madhya Pradesh
and Another) is relied upon to bolster the submission that once an amount
for OTS is quantified in pursuance to an offer given by the Bank and the
said amount is deposited, the Bank cannot take a different stand, enhance
the amount or treat the document Annexure P/1 as only an ‘intimation
letter’. In fact, it should be treated to be accepted and respondents are
bound by the principles of ‘estoppel’ flowing from Section 115 of Indian
7.      No doubt, Shri Wajid Hyder submits that the receipt of the letter
Annexure P/5 (at page-26) mentions the name of sender as Rukmani Devi
Public School, fact remains that apart from the said letter, the e-mails for
the same purpose were sent by the petitioner not accepting the
enhancement of amount to Rs.50.50 lakhs. There is no denial about those
e-mails sent by the petitioner. The said school is also run by the petitioner
and therefore, the concerned clerk/peon has erroneously mentioned the
name of the school in lieu of name of the petitioner, which will not make
any difference. In nutshell, Shri Wajid Hyder submits that petitioner has
fulfilled the requirement of letter dated 09-03-2021. The petitioner cannot
be said to be 'ineligible'. The formula prescribed in the scheme is fulfilled
and the amount quantified in the letter dated 09-03-2021 is in consonance
with clause-4 of the scheme. The ‘ledger amount’ as per affidavit of Shri
Aditya Prakash, General Manager of the Bank is Rs. 0.50 Crores. The
petitioner was required to pay 40% of that amount whereas Rs.50.50 lakhs
quantified by them is almost equal to the complete ‘ledger amount’. Thus,
said quantification of Rs.50.50 lakhs runs contrary to the OTS scheme.
8.      Shri Abhijit C.Thakur, learned counsel for the respondent/Bank has
taken a diametrically opposite stand by contending that :-
(a) No assurance was given that OTS of Rs.36.50 lacs will be
accepted.
(b) It was clarified that OTS will be processed subject to
eligibility of the scheme.
(c) It was specifically mentioned in the said intimation letter that
the said letter is only an intimation letter and the said letter
should not be construed as sanction letter.
(d) It was also clarified that on receipt of written application
with requisite down payment, the proposal will be processed and
approval amount by competent sanctioning authority in eligible
cases will be conveyed by sanction letter.
(e) By mentioning the words “eligible cases”, it was made clear
that inspite of moving application for OTS, it will be sanctioned
in eligible cases and not in all cases.”
9.     To elaborate, learned counsel for the respondent/Bank submits that
letter dated 09.3.2021 is only a letter of 'intimation' and not letter of
'sanction'. The      petitioner  is   misconstruing   the  same,    which   is
10.    Neither the letter dated 09.3.2021 nor the OTS scheme has any
binding effect. The petitioner has not deposited the entire amount of
Rs.36,50,000/-, indeed deposited only Rs.35,00,000/- on 19.3.2021, which
was realized by the Bank on 16.9.2021. Thus, the conditions mentioned in
the letter dated 09.3.2021 are not satisfied.
11.    Shri Thakur has taken pains to contend that the letter allegedly
written by the petitioner and filed alongwith the petition were never served
on the Bank. He indirectly doubted the genuineness of the said document
by placing reliance on the receipt wherein the name of the sender is
mentioned as 'Rukmani Devi Public School, Bhopal' and not the name of
the petitioner.
12.    The next limb of argument of Shri Thakur is based on the letter of
the bank dated 25.8.2021, wherein it was clearly mentioned that
compromise proposal of petitioner is accepted for Rs.50.50 lacs.
Thereafter, by letter dated 13.9.2021, it was made clear that it is presumed
that petitioner has accepted the proposal. A reference is made to clause-7
of the OTS Scheme, wherein it is mentioned that OTS is valid for two
months from the date of sanction. If borrower fails to comply for
repayment within two months, the OTS will automatically expire after two
months of sanction or 31.3.2022 whichever is earlier. Thus, by operation of
this provision itself, the OTS came to an end automatically after two
months from 25th of August 2021.
13.    Furthermore, it is submitted that the Apex Court in Bijnour Urban
Cooperative Bank Vs. Minal Agrawal (Civil Appeal No.7411/21) opined
that the OTS scheme does not have any binding force. In the impugned
judgment therein, the High Court has materially erred and exceeded its
jurisdiction in issuing writ of mandamus against the Bank. The Division
Bench Judgment of Allahabad High Court reported in AIR 2004, All. 164,
(Mahalaxmi Floor Mills Pvt. Ltd. Vs. State of U.P.) was relied upon to
contend that OTS scheme is not binding and the borrower has no right
whatsoever to get a writ of mandamus from this Court.
14.    The parties confined their arguments to the extent indicated above.
15.    We have heard the parties at length and perused the record.
16.    It is apposite to quote the document dated 09.3.2021, (Annexure A-1)
in toto, which is foundation for the case set up by the petitioner :-
Scheme for One Time Settlement – Maha Samadhan
CIF No.40129973884_ Branch Asset Recovery branch,
1. Bank of Maharashtra has come out with a scheme for One
Time Settlement (OTS) of Non-Performing assets as on 31st
March 2020 in some eligible categories. In this connection, we
would like to advise you to contact the Bank for eligibility
under MAHA SAMADHAN YOJANA 2020-21 scheme :
(ii) Amount of OTS Rs.36,50,000/- (As per Settlement formula
given in the scheme) plus processing Fees @ 0.05% with
applicable GST.
(iii) Application for OTS will be processed subject to eligibility
under the Scheme and on deposit of minimum *down Payment
mentioned at S.No.4 below.
(iv) The balance amount be paid within two months of
conveying sanction or any date specified in the sanction
whichever is earlier, failing which the OTS will automatically
expire, which please note.
2. (Wherever and as applicable) Since your case is pending
before DRT/Lok Adalat/Other Court any settlement will be
subject to consent decree/necessary orders from the respective
Court, and this letter is without prejudice to the right and
contention of the Bank in the said proceedings.
Since you have been issued notice under the Securitization and
Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security
Interest Act, 2002, this notice is without any prejudice to our
rights to take/continue actions under the act unless your dues are
settled under the present MAHA SAMADHAN YOJANA
2020-21 scheme as stated above, or otherwise.
3. Please advise your willingness immediately to settle the dues.
*Your request for settlement will be processed only after
ensuring the eligibility under the scheme and receipt of upfront
amount/No lien amount.
4. Minimum 10% of the OTS Amount as upfront amount to be
credited to the loan account or minimum 25% of OTS amount to
kept in "No Lien Account".
5. Please note that this is only intimation letter and should not be
construed as sanction letter. On receipt of your written
application under the scheme along with requisite *down
payment, the proposal will be processed and the sanction
letter will be conveyed, in eligible cases after due approval by
competent sanctioning authority.
17.    A plain reading of this letter makes following things clear :-
(a)    It is issued in furtherance of scheme         for one time
settlement, (Maha Samadhan Yojna 2020-2021).
(b)    The    bank    quantified   the   amount     of   OTS    as
(c)    The said quantification is based on settlement formula
given in the scheme.
(d)    The application of OTS will be processed 'subject to
eligibility'.
(e)    The petitioner, if willing, was       required to deposit
minimum of 10% of the OTS amount as 'upfront amount' in the
bank, which shall be kept in the 'no lien account'.
(f)    The letter is termed as 'intimation letter' and can not be
construed as 'sanction letter'.
(g)    On receipt of written application with requisite 'down
payment', the proposal will be processed and sanction letter will
be conveyed in eligible cases.
18.     It is clear like noon day that the amount was quantified by the Bank
as per settlement formula given in the scheme. The respondents in their
pleadings nowhere stated that the amount so quantified i.e. Rs.36,50,000/-
was erroneously quantified or runs contrary to the settlement formula given
in the scheme. The respondents could not point out the basis on the
strength of which a magic figure of Rs.50.50 lakhs was determined by them
in letter dated 25.8.2021.
19.    The letter dated 25.8.2021 shows that compromise proposal of
petitioner was accepted for Rs.50.50 lakhs. We are unable to countenance
this action of the Bank. If the petitioner gave proposal pursuant to Bank’s
quantification    for   Rs.36,50,000/-,       Bank  cannot     unilaterally treat
acceptance for Rs.50.50 lakhs. Putting it differently, the petitioner never
gave his consent for the said magic figure of Rs.50.50 lakhs.
20.    Irrationality, illegality and procedural impropriety are three
important parameters on which an administrative decision can be put to
test. Lord Diplock, L.J. in Council of Civil Service Unions Vs. Minister
for the Civil Service applied the said text as under :-
(i) 'Illegality' which means that the "decision-maker
must understand correctly the law that regulates his
decision-making power and must give effect to it".
It means that the decision-maker must keep
within the scope of his legal power. Illegality means
that the decision-maker has made an error of law; it
represents infidelity of an official action to a statutory
purpose. Such grounds as excess of jurisdiction, patent
error of law, etc. fall under the head of "illegality".
(ii) 'Irrationality' denotes unreasonableness in the
sence of Wednesbury unreasonableness.
(iii) Procedural Impropriety – The expression
includes failure to observe procedural rules including
the rules of natural justice or fairness wherever these
are applicable.
This principle was followed by the Apex Court in (1994) 6 SCC 651
Tata Cellular vs. Union of India.
21.    If impugned action is tested on the anvil of said principles, it will be
22.    The Bank quantified the amount as per the formula given in the
scheme as Rs.36,50,000/-. No justifiable reason, formula or enabling clause
is shown to us for enhancing the amount from Rs.36,50,000/- to Rs.50.50
lakhs in the order dated 25.8.2021.
23.    The amount so quantified unilaterally i.e. Rs.50.50 lakhs also runs
contrary to the OTS scheme (Annexure R/1). A conjoint reading of clause-4
(which deals with “Settlement amount as per the proposed scheme”), 40%
of ledger balance is the criteria for determining the OTS amount. At the
cost of repetition, in the letter dated 09.3.2021, the Bank stated that amount
of Rs.36,50,000/- was determined as per the settlement formula of the
scheme. Thus, any enhanced amount by the Bank cannot be said to be in
consonance with the OTS scheme.
24.    Law has reached its finest moments’, stated Douglas, J. in United
States v. Wunderlich [96 L Ed 113 : 342 US 98 (1951)] , ‘when it has
freed man from the unlimited discretion of some ruler…. Where discretion
is absolute, man has always suffered.’ It is in this sense that the rule of law
may be said to be the sworn enemy of caprice. Discretion, as Lord
Mansfield stated it in classic terms in Wilkes [R. v. Wilkes, (1770) 4 Burr
2527 : 98 ER 327 : (1558-1774) All ER Rep 570], (ER p. 334): Burr at p.
2539 ‘means sound discretion guided by law. It must be governed by rule,
not by humour: it must not be arbitrary, vague, and fanciful.
25.    This view was quoted with profit by Supreme Court in the case of
Natural Resources Allocation, In Re, Special Reference No. 1 of 2012
26.    Thus, we are unable to hold that Bank had any unfettered discretion
under the scheme or otherwise to enhance the amount from Rs.36,50,000/-
Illegality and procedural impropriety :
27.    The enhanced amount determined in the communication dated
25.8.2021 is an outcome of unilateral exercise at the end of the Bank. The
petitioner was not a party to this decision. Thus, by no stretch of
imagination, this document can be construed to be an acceptance of a
compromise proposal on the part of the petitioner. For this reason also, the
letter dated 25.8.2021 and subsequent letters issued in furtherance thereof
cannot sustain judicial scrutiny. We are unable to pursuade ourselves with
the line of reasoning given in the letter dated 13.9.2021 where Bank
presumed that proposal has been accepted. There cannot be any one-sided
presumption of acceptance in a matter of this nature where no acceptance
was ever given by the petitioner directly or indirectly regarding Rs.50.50
28.    A microscopic reading of the letter dated 09.3.2021 shows that
intimation letter needs to be processed subject to 'eligibility' of the
petitioner and further subject to down payment by the petitioner of 10% of
the amount so quantified. Indisputably, the petitioner deposited 95.89%
amount i.e Rs.35,00,000/- out of Rs.36,50,000/-. Thereafter, in our
considered opinion, the Bank was only required to examine whether
petitioners fall within the 'eligibility' clause and whether he has deposited
the 10% of the said amount. It cannot be said that the petitioner was not
falling within the “Eligibility Clause”. We say so for the simple reason that
if petitioner would have been ineligible, there was no occasion for the
respondents to even consider the claim of the petitioner for enhancement of
amount from Rs.36,50,000/- to Rs.50.50 lakhs. The petitioner was very
much eligible and in the teeth of 'eligibility clause' of OTS also, we are
unable to hold that petitioner was not eligible.
29.     The impugned action of the Bank can be tested on the doctrine of
legitimate expectation. The concept of legitimate expectation is of
European origin. It is one of the fundamental Principles of European
Community Law. (See: Durbeck v Hauptzollant Frankfurt an Main
Flughafen, (1981) ECR 1095, at 1120; Mulder v. Minister Van
Landbouw en Visserji, (1988) ECR 2321; Spagl v. Hauptzollant
Rosenteim (1990) ECR 453. For some more cases on legitimate
expectation from European Law, see, Sedley, J.’s opinion in R. v. Maff,
ex p. Hamble Fisheries, (1995) 2 All ER 714).
The statement of Lord DIPLOCK in CCSU* is regarded as envisaging
legitimate expectation extending to an expectation of a benefit. This may
(i)     what a person has been permitted by the concerned authority to enjoy
and which he can legitimately expect to be permitted to continue to enjoy
until “there has been communicated to him some rational grounds for
withdrawing it on which he has been given an opportunity to comment”;
(ii)    he has received assurance from the concerned authority that the
benefit will not be withdrawn without giving him first an opportunity of
advancing reasons for contending that it should not be withdrawn.
(iii)   It may also extend to a benefit in the future which has not yet been
enjoyed but has been promised.
30.     Lord FRASER1 also observed as follows:
“ But even where a person claiming some benefit or
privilege has no legal right to it, as a matter of private
law, he may have a legitimate expectation of receiving
the benefit or privilege, and, if so, the courts will
protect his expectation by judicial review as a matter of
public law… Legitimate or reasonable expectation may
arise from an express promise given on behalf of a
public authority or from the existence of a regular
practice which the claimant can reasonably expect to
continue.”
31.     Characterizing the doctrine of legitimate expectation as a valuable
and developing doctrine, BINGHAM, L.J., stated in the case of R. v.
Inland Revenue Commissioners, ex. p. MFK Underwriting Agents Ltd.,
“If a public authority so conducts itself as to create a
legitimate expectation that a certain course will be
followed it would often be unfair if the authority were
permitted to follow a different course to the detriment
of one who entertained the expectation, particularly if
he acted on it… The doctrine of legitimate
expectation is rooted in fairness.”
32.     SEDLEY, J., ruled that even though policy change may take place
from time to time, the policy maker should seek to accommodate legitimate
expectations.
“Thus it is an obligation to exercise powers fairly
which permits expectations to be counterpoised to
policy change, not necessarily in order to thwart it but.
. . in order to seek a proper exception to the policy
See : Page No.1656 of Principles of Administrative Law by M.P. Jain & S.N. Jain
British Oxyen Co Ltd v. Minister of Technology, (1970) 3 WLR 488
“While policy is for the policy maker alone, the
fairness of his or her decision not to accommodate
reasonable expectations which the policy will thwart
remains the court’s concern….”
While the court accepts ministerial freedom to formulate and to
reformulate policy, ‘it is equally the court’s duty to protect the interest of
those individuals whose expectation of different treatment has a legitimacy
which in fairness out-tops the policy choice which tends to frustrate it’.
“Legitimate expectation is now in effect a term of art,
reserved for expectations which are not only
reasonable but which will be sustained by the court in
the face of changes of policy; secondly, that whether
this point has been reached is determined by the
court, whether on ground of rationality, of legality or
of fairness, of all of which the court, not the decision-
34.     The Supreme Court of India in the case of National Buildings
Construction Corporation v. S. Raghunathan, AIR 1998 SC 2779 has
“The doctrine of ‘Legitimate Expectation’ has its
genesis in the field of administrative law. The
Government and its departments, in administering the
affairs of the country are expected to honour their
statements of policy or intention and treat the citizens
with full personal consideration without any iota of
abuse of discretion. The policy statement cannot be
disregarded unfairly or applied selectively. Unfairness
in the form of unreasonableness is akin to violation of
natural justice. It was in his context that the doctrine
of ‘Legitimate Expectation’ was evolved which has
today become a source of substantive as well as
procedural rights. But claims based on ‘Legitimate
Expectation’ have been held to require reliance on
representations and resulting detriment to the
claimant in the same way as claims based on
promissory estoppel.”
R v. Ministry of Agriculture Fisheries and Food ex p Hamble (offshore) Fisheries Ltd., (1995) 2 All ER at 732
35.     The Apex Court opined that the doctrine of legitimate expectation is
a 'latest recruit' to a long list of concepts fashioned by the courts for review
of administrative actions. No doubt, the doctrine has an important place in
the review. Under the said doctrine, a person may have reasonable or
legitimate expectation of being treated in a certain way by an
administrative authority even though he has no right in law to receive the
benefit. In such a situation, if a decision is taken by an administrative
authority adversely affecting his interests, he may have justifiable
grievance in the light of the fact of continuous receipt of the benefit,
legitimate expectation to receive the benefit or privilege which he has
enjoyed all throughout. Such expectation may arise either from the express
promise or from consistent practice which the applicant may reasonably
expect to continue (See: Confederation of Ex-Serviceman Associations v.
Union of India, (2006) 8 SCC 399, 416).
36.     If the present case is examined on the anvil of principles laid down in
aforesaid cases, it will be crystal clear that the petitioner was clearly given
to understand that the OTS amount determined is based on a valid OTS
scheme and in order to get the benefit of said scheme, petitioner was
required to fulfill certain formalities. It was further made clear in the
communication dated 4.1.2021 (Annexure P/1) that if petitioner is willing
to pay the said amount (10% of which was required to be paid forthwith)
the only formality on the part of the Bank will be to examine the
petitioner’s eligibility. As discussed above, the petitioner cannot be treated
as ineligible. Thus, doctrine of legitimate expectation can be pressed into
service in a case of this nature where a Public Sector Bank, a ‘State’ within
the meaning of Article 12 of the Constitution has given the petitioner to
understand that if he accepts the offer and acts in a particular manner, he
will get desired result.
37.    The stand unilaterally taken by the Bank in the subsequent
communication dated 25.8.2021 runs contrary to the OTS scheme and
doctrine of legitimate expectation.
The decision dated 25.8.2021 (Annexure P/4) whereby Bank
enhanced OTS amount unilaterally has an adverse impact on the petitioner
which is arbitrary and contrary to Principles of Natural Justice. Fairness is
an integral part of good administration. The Bank has not acted in a just,
proper and reasonable manner.
38.    The Apex Court in the case of Sardar Associations (supra) has held
"While making a deviation, the Board of Directors of a
public sector bank could not have taken recourse to a
policy decision which is per se discriminatory. The
respondent Bank is ‘State’ within the meaning of
Article 12 of the Constitution of India apart from the
fact that it is bound to follow the guidelines issued by
Reserve Bank of India. If, therefore, the broad policy
decision contend in the guidelines were required to be
followed, the power of the Board of Directors to make
deviation in terms of Clause 4 thereof would only be in
relation to some minor matters which does not touch
the broad aspects of the policy decision and in
particular the one governing the non-discriminatory
treatment. In a case of this nature, we are satisfied that
the respondent Bank is guilty of violation of the
equality clause contend in the Reserve Bank of India
Guidelines as also Article 14 of the Constitution of
39.    So far judgment of the Supreme Court in The Bijnor Urban
Cooperative Bank vs. Meenal Agrawal (Civil Appeal No.7411 of 2021)
is concerned, it is clear that main question before the Apex Court was that
whether a writ of mandamus can be issued directing the Bank to positively
consider the grant of benefit under the OTS scheme and that too dehors the
eligibility criteria mentioned under the OTS scheme. As noticed above, the
petitioner's claim was not dehors the eligibility criteria mentioned in the
OTS scheme. Indeed, letter dated 09.03.2021 shows that amount was
quantified as per the settlement formula given in the scheme. In the said
judgment, the interference was made because the borrower therein did not
deposit the requisite amount and there was no procedural impropriety in the
decision making process. The Bank provided even personal hearing to the
borrower. A securitization proceeding was pending against the borrower.
Thus, in a different factual backdrop, the said judgment was delivered
which cannot be pressed into service in the instant case.
40.    It is well settled that there is no precedent of facts. Only legal
prepositions are binding (See - Ram Prasad Sarma v. Mani Kumar Subba,
(2003) 1 SCC 289 ; Rekha Mukherjee v. Ashis Kumar Das, (2005) 3 SCC
427 and Jayant Verma v. Union of India, (2018) 4 SCC 743 ). It is
equally trite that a singular different fact may change the precedential value
of a judgment. The ratio decidendi of judgments cited by Shri Thakur does
not cover the case in hand.
41.    The judgment of Allahabad High Court in the case of M/s
Mahalaxmi Floor Mills v. State of U.P. [2005(1) Banker's Journal 87],
is also of no assistance to the respondents because we have examined the
impunged orders and action of the Bank on the touchstone of legitimate
expectation, irrationality, illegality and procedural impropriety.
42.    As noticed above, we are unable to give stamp of approval to the
impugned orders and action of the Bank. Since petitioners promptly filed
instant petitions within two months from the date of issuance of order dated
22.9.2021, we are unable to hold that because of clause-7 of OTS scheme,
offer stood expired automatically. The petitioner not only promptly
challenged the said order, it is noteworthy that petitioner never acceeded to
the unilateral decision dated 25.08.2021. Even otherwise when letter dated
25.8.2021 is held to be illegal by us, clause-7 of policy cannot take away
the fruits of OTS benefits.
43.    In view of foregoing analysis, the impugned letters dated 25.8.2021
(Annexure P/4) and 22.9.2021 (Annexure P/13) are set aside. Since
petitioner is eligible and he accepted the offer of quantified amount and
deposited 95.89% of Rs.36,50,000/- within the stipulated time, the
respondent/Bank is bound to accept the same and issue the 'sanction letter'.
The same course will be followed by the Bank in the connected matter,
where as per learned counsel for the parties, the legal questions are same
and only amounts involved are different.
44.    Thus, impugned orders in both the cases are set aside. The OTS
