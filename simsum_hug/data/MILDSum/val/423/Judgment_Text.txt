These Petitions coming on for hearing,upon perusing the Memorandum of
Grounds of Criminal Petition and upon hearing the arguments of Sri            B  MOHAN
,Advocate for the Petitioner in all Criminal Petitions and the Public Prosecutor on
behalf of the Respondent No.'1 in all Criminal Petitions and of Sri V.V.L.N.Sarma
Advocate for the Respondent No. 2 in all Criminal Petitions
The Court made the following: ORDER
CRIMINAL PETITION Nos.5O58. 5O69, 5O76 and
Since facts of the case and the issue involved in all these
Criminal Petitions are similar/ all these Criminal Petitions are taken
up together and are being disposed of by this common order.
2.    Criminal Petition No.5069, 5076, 5081 and 5068          of 202I,
under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (for
short, 'Cr.P.C.') are filed by the petitioner/A.2 seeking to quash the
proceedings against her     in C.C.No.134 of 2019 on the file of VII
Special Metropolitan Magistrate, Ranga Reddy District, at
Hastinapur and C.C.Nos.274,275 and 276 of 2019 on the file of XiI
Special Metropolitan Magistrate, Ranga Reddy District, at
Hastinapur, respectively.
3.    Heard Sri B.Mohan, learned counsel for the petitioner/A.2,
learned Assistant Public Prosecutor for the respondent No.1/State,
Sri V.V.L.N. Sarma, learned counsel for the respondent           No.2/
complainant, in all the Criminal Petitions and perused the record.
4,    The learned counsel for the petitioner/A.2 would contend that
the petltioner, who is arrayed as A.2 in the subject C.Cs, is not    a
signatory to the subject cheques and she is falsely implicated in the
sub{ect C.Cs. No ingredients constituting the offence under Section
13S of Negotiable Instruments Act, 1BB1 (for short "N.I.Act") are
made out against the petitioner/A.2 and therefore, continuation of
proceedings against      the petitioner/A.2 is nothing but abuse of
process of law. In support of his contentions'
upon the decisions reported      in Alka Khandu Avhad vs' Amar
Syamprasad Mishra and otherst and Mrs'
M/s. Sheth Developers Pvt' Ltd' and anothel and ultimately
prayed to allow the Criminal Petitions as
5.       On the other hand, the learned counsel for
complainant conceded that the petitioner/A.2
the subject cheques but contended that the
of the money transactions and handing over of the
It  is submitted that the petitioner/A.2 is maintaining
with her husband i.e, A.1 and the subject cheques relate
joint account only. The petitioner/A'2 has knowledge of the subject
transactions and most of the amounts were paid to her
only. In view of these circumstances, the Courts below rightly
cognizance of the offence under Section 138 of N'I'Act against
petitioner/A.2 along with  A'1. It  is further submitted that the trial
in the subject C.Cs has already commenced and hence' there
irregularity in proceeding against the petitioner/A'2 for the offence
under section 138 of N.I.Act and ultimately prayed to dismiss
Clriminal Petir:ion s.
6. The learned Assistant Public Prosecutor supported the
arguments advanced by the learned counsel for respondent No'2/
complainantandultimatelyprayedtodismisstheCriminalPetitions.
7. In view of the above submissions made by both sides, the
point for determination in these Criminal petitions
"Whether the               proceedings against                     the
petitioner/A.2 in C.C.No.I34 of 2O19 on the
District, at Hastinapur and C.C.Nos.274/ 275 and 276
of 2O79 on the file of XII Special Metropolitan
Magistrate, Ranga Reddy District, at Hastinapurt are
8.        POINT: As seen from the material placed on record,
petitioner is arrayed as A.2 in the subject
the file of VII Special tvletropolitan Magistrate, Ranga                     Reddy
District, at Hastinapur and c.c,Nos.274,27s and
the file of XU Special Metropolitan Magistrate, Ranga Reddy
District, at Hastinapur. The Courts below took cognizance
said cases for the offence under Sections 138 of N.I.Act
and his wife i.e, petitioner/A.2. The main contention of the
counsel for the petitioner/A.2 is that the proceedings against
petitioner/A.2       in the subject C.C.s are         Iiable to be quashed,
inasmuch as she           is merely a joint account holder and not a
signatory to the subject cheques.
9.        Here,  it is apt and appropriate to extract Secilon 138 of
"Secfron 138 - Dishonour of cheque for insufficiency,
Where any cheque drawn by a person on an account
maintained by him with a banker for payment of any amount
of money to another person from out o'f that account for the
discharge,. in whole or in part, of any debt or other tiability, is
returned by the bank unpaid, either because of the amount
of money standing to the credit of that account is insufficient
to ioioi, the chique or that it exceeds the amount arranged
ti ae paia from ihat account by an agreement.made              with
tn"t iant , such     person     shalt  be  deemed        to  have
committetd an offence and shall, without preiudice to any
other provisions of this Act, be punished with imprisonment
fi, u i"r* which may be extended to two years,         or with fine
which may extend to twice the amount         of  the  cheque, or
with both': Provided that nothing contained in this section
(a)   the cheque  has been presented to the bank within a
of six months from the date on which it is drawn or
within the period of its validity, whichever is earlier;
(b) the payee or the hotder in due course of the cheque, as
ih" ,ut" may be, makes a demand for the payment of the
said amount of money by giving a notice in writing, to the
drawer of the cheque, within thirty days of the receipt of
information by him from the bank regarding the return of the
(c) the drawer of such cheque fails to make the payment of
tne said amount of money to the payee or, as the case may
be, to the holder in due course of the cheque, within fifteen
days of the receipt of the said notice'
As per the mandate given under Section 138 of N.I Act, where any
cheque drawn by a person on an account maintained by him with                 a
banker for payment of any amount of money to another person
from out of that account for the discharge, in whole or in part, of
any debt or other liability, is returned by the bank unpaid, either
because    of the amount of money standing to the credit of that
account is insufficient to honour the cheque or that            it exceeds the
amount arranged to be paid from that account by an agreement
made with that bank, such person shall be deemed                      to have
committed an oFfence.
tO. ln Atka Khandu Avhad's case (supra), cited by the learned
counsel for the petitioner/A.2, the Hon'ble Apex Court observed as
"Para 7.: On a fair reading of Section 138 of the NI Act,
before a person can be prosecuted, the foilowing
conditions are required to be satisfied:
i) that the cheque is drawn by a person and on an
account maintained by him with a banker;
ii) for the payment of any amount of rnoney to another
person from out of that account for the discharge, in
whole or in part, of any debt or other liability; and
iii) the said cheque is returned by the bank unpaid,
either because of the amount of money standing to the
credit of that account is insufficient to honour the
cheque or that it exceeds the amount arranged to be
paid from that account.
Therefore, a person who is the signatory to the cheque
and the cheque is drawn by that person on an account
maintained by him and the cheque has been issued for
the discharge, in whole or in part, of any debt or other
liability and the said cheque has been returned by the
bank unpaid, such person can be said to have committed
an offence. Section 138 of the NI Act does not speak
about the joint liability. Even in case of a joint liability, in
case of individual person, a person other than a person
who has drawn the cheque on an account maintained by
him, cannot be prosecuted for the offence Under Section
138 of the NI Act. A person might have been jointly
liable to pay the debt, but if such a person who might
have been liable to pay the debt jointly, cannot be
prosecuted unless the bank account is jointly maintained
and that he was a signatory to the cheque.
11. In Mrs, Aparna A. Shah's case (2 supra),                cited by the
learned counsel for petitioner/A.2, the Hon'ble Apex Court took the
view that under Section 138 of the N.I. Act, it is only the drawer of
the cheque who can be proceeded. In the said case, the husband
had drawn the cheque on the account, which was being jointly
maintained by him and his wife, The Hon'ble Supreme Court held
that in case oF issuance of a cheque from joint account, a joint
account holder cannot be prosecuted unless the cheque has been
signed by each and every person who has a joint account holder.
Hon'ble Supreme Court observed as      follows:                   ,,
"PArc-E: We also hold that under Section 138 of the
N-i. Act, in case of issuance of cheque from ioint
accounts, a joint account holder cannot be prosecuted
unless tie iheque has been signed by each and every
person who is a joint account hotder' The said principle
an exception to Section 141 of the N'L Act which
would have no application in the case on hand' The
proceedings filed under Section 138 cannot be used as
arm twisting tactics to recover the amount alleqedly
due from the appellant' It cannot be said that the
complainant has no remedY against the appellant but
certainly not under Section 138' The culpability
attached to dishonour of a cheque can, in no case
"except in case of Section 141 of the N'L Act" be
extended to those on whose behalf the cheque is
issued. This Court reiterates that it is only the drawer of
the cheque who can be made an accused in any
proceeding under Section 138 of the Act. Even the High
Court has specificatly recorded the stand of the
appellant that she was not the signatory of the cheque
but rejected the contention that the amount was not
due and payabte by her solely on the ground that the
trial is in progress. It is to be noted that only after
issuance of process, a person can approach the High
Court seeking quashing of the same on various grounds
available to him. Accordingly, the High Court was
clearty wrong in hotding that the prayer of the appellant
cannot even be considered. Further, the High Court
itself has directed the Magistrate to carry out the
process of ad mission/den ial of documents. In such
circumstances, it cannot be concluded that the trial is in
L2. In the instant case, it is evident from the entire material
placed on record, particularly, the complaints filed by the
respondent No.2/complainant under Section 138             of N.I. Act r/w
Sec.200 Cr.P.C, the petitioner/A.2 is merely a jolnt account holder
and she is not the signatory to the subject cheques. On the other
hand,      it is culled out from the record that though the account
relating      to the disputed cheques is a joint account, only one
signature, which appears to be of A.1, are seen on those disputed
cheques. Penal provisions should be construed strictly, but not in       a
routine/casual manner. The words used in Section 138 of N.I.Act
person, except the contingencies
learned counsel for the petitioner/A,2
but not a signatory to the subject
until he/she is a signatory to the
cheque. Further, the commencement
C.Cs cannot be    a ground to continue the proceedings
below erred in taking cognizance
the petitioner/A.2, particularly, when
disputed cheques, So the contentions
respondents      do  not  merit consideration. In view of           these
circumstances, when no ingredients
are made out against the petitioner/A.2,
proceedings against the petitioner/A.2
is abuse ot process of law.
Therefore,     the  proceedings   in the subject C.Cs against the
be quashed.
13. In the result,      Criminat petition Nos.5069, 5076, 5081
5068     of 202I,   are allowed and the proceedings against
petitioner/A.2 in C.C.No.134      of  2OI9 on the file    of VII   Special
C.C.Nos.274, 275 and 276         of 2019 on the fite of XII       Special
hereby quashed.
