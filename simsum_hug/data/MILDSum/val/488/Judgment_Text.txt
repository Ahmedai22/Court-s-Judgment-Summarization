impugned order passed in Cr.M.P.No.1721 of 2021 in Spl.C.C.No.9 of 2020
on the file of the learned Special Court for POCSO Cases, Tirunelveli and
set aside the same and allow the set aside petition.
2. The learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that the petitioner
is the accused in Spl.C.C.No.9 of 2020 on the file of the learned Special
Court for POCSO Cases, Tirunelveli. He was charged for the offences under
Sections 366 (A) of IPC and Section 5(1), r/w 6 of POCSO Act. In this case,
so far 12 witnesses have been examined. P.W.2 is the victim girl and P.W.3
is the mother of the victim girl. Even though P.W.2 and P.W.3 were
examined in chief and cross-examined on 07.10.2021, in the cross
examination, some important defence with regard to the contradictions that
have been mentioned in the chief examination of P.W.2 and P.W.3 could
not be raised. Hence, the petitioner filed an application to recall P.W.2 and
P.W.3 under Section 311 Cr.P.C in Cr.M.P.No.1721 of 2021. By the
impugned order, dated 13.04.2022, the learned Judge, permitted to recall
P.W.3, mother of the victim girl for further cross-examination on payment
of cost and with regard to the victim P.W.2, dismissed the said petition. This
petition is partly allowed, on payment of cost of Rs.3,000/- on or before
29.04.2021 and permitted to recall for further cross-examination on
payment of batta and process to P.W.3 and with regard to P.W.2, the said
petition is dismissed. Aggrieved by this order, this petition has been filed.
3. The learned Government Advocate (Criminal Side) appearing for
the respondent submitted that so far, the trial Court examined P.W.1 to
P.W.12 and posted the matter on 01.07.2022 for further proceedings.
Already P.W.3 was permitted to recall, for further cross-examination and
P.W.2 being a victim girl, in order to avoid harassment to victim girl, the
petition was dismissed by the trial Court and there is no reason to interfere
with the order passed by the trial Court.
4. I have considered the rival submissions and on perusal of the
records, it is seen that the petitioner is an accused in Spl.C.C.No.9 of 2020
on the file of the Special Court for POCSO Cases, Tirunelveli. The
respondent police prosecuted the petitioner for having sexually harassed the
victim girl and the accused committed the offence punishable under
Sections 366(A) I.P.C, and Section 5(1) r/w 6 of POCSO Act. At the time of
occurrence, the victim girl was studying in the College, B.A. II year and the
occurrence took place in the year 2018 and at that time, the victim girl was
aged about 17 years.
5. On perusal of the impugned order passed by the learned trial Judge,
in view of the Section 33 (5) of POCSO Act, to avoid repeatedly harassing
the victim, the trial Court dismissed the petition with regard to P.W.2 and
with regard to P.W.3, the petition was allowed with cost of Rs.3,000/- to be
paid on or before 29.04.2021.
6. The learned counsel for the petitioner in support of the argument
relied upon the judgment of the Karnataka High Court in Crl.O.P.No.4449
of 2022, dated 06.06.2022 and submitted that once the victim crosses
18 years of age, the rigor of Section 33 (5) of the Act get diluted and in
order to give a fair chance to the petitioner/accused, the victim may be
recalled.
7. I have considered the submission made by the learned counsel for
the petitioner in this aspect. Admittedly, the victim was aged about 17 years
at the time of occurrence in the year 2018. Now, she becomes major and
also this incident happened due to the love affair between the petitioner/
accused and the victim girl. The father of the victim gave a complaint
against the accused. The statement was given by the victim under Section
161 Cr.P.C before the respondent police. He wants to expose the
contradictions in the statement of the victim before the trial Court. An
opportunity must be given to an accused to place his defence. Further
illustration Section 33 (5) of the Act is only to ensure that the child should
not be repeatedly called for the Court for examining as it would affect the
mind of the child. Now, the victim is not a child, and becomes major.
Therefore, by invoking Section 33 (5) of Act, to recall a victim for the
purpose of cross examination by the accused and in order to give a last
chance to the accused to place his defence to make prosecution of criminal
proceedings against him, P.W.2 may be recalled and the petitioner may be
permitted to cross-examine.
8. Therefore, the impugned order passed by the trial Court dismissing
the petition filed by the petitioner to recall P.W.2 for cross examination is
set aside and this petition is allowed. The trial Court is hereby directed to
recall P.W.2 for further cross examination and the petitioner is hereby
directed to cross-examine the P.W.2 and P.W.3 on the same day. It is further
directed to pay cost of the witnesses.
9. In the result, this Criminal Original Petition is allowed as above.
Consequently the connected Miscellaneous Petition is closed.
