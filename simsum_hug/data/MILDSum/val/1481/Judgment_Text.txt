438 CR.P.C. No. - 4645 of 2022
Counsel for Applicant :- Ramesh Chandra Yadav,Ramashray
Counsel for Opposite Party :- G.A.
1.     Heard Sri Ramesh Chandra Yadav, learned counsel for the
applicant and the learned Additional Government Advocate for the
2.     By means of present anticipatory bail application, the applicant
has shown his apprehension of arrest in Case Crime No. 240 of
2021 u/s 147, 323,354,504, 506, 376 I.P.C., P.S, Shadiyabad, District
Ghazipur. Learned counsel has submitted that the applicant
3.     The attention has been drawn towards the impugned F.I.R.
wherein the present applicant is not named and no allegation of any
kind whatsoever has been leveled against him. Learned counsel for
the applicant has submitted that having ulterior motive and
extraneous design in her mind the informant has deliberately and
intentionally not named the present applicant in the F.I.R. as she has
stated herself as wife of the present applicant. At the time of lodging
of F.I.R. she has given impression that she is wife of the present
4.     The present applicant is an Army personnel serving in Indian
Army, presently posted at Line of Control, China Border. He has got
married with one Priya Yadav as certificate of marriage to that effect
has been enclosed with the application as Annexure no. 4.
5.     The learned counsel has further submitted that the present
applicant is not married to the informant / complainant. Since the
informant / complainant is not married wife of the applicant,
therefore, she could have not entered into the house of the present
applicant in his absence showing herself as his wife when his family
members were fully aware that he is married to Priya Yadav.
6.    However, while recording her statement u/s 164 Cr.P.C., as per
para 10 of the anticipatory bail rejection order passed by the learned
court below, the complainant / informant has stated that she was
having affair with present applicant since long and they got married
in one temple.
7.    Sri Yadav has submitted that no credible evidence has been
provided to the investigating officer by the informant / complainant
and the investigation is still going on.
8.    The present applicant is posted at Line of Control, China
Border and he could not know about any investigation being
pending. As a matter of fact no summon to cooperate with the
investigation is served upon the applicant nor any bailable or non-
bailable warrant has been served upon the present applicant to
cooperate with the investigation.
9.    This Court in re: Vinod Kumar Singh @ Vinod Singh vs.
State of U.P. in Case No. 5195 of 2021 vide order dated 10.12.2021
was pleased to set aside the proclamation issued u/s 82 Cr.P.C. for
the reason that before seeking proclamation u/s 82 Cr.P.C. the
investigating officer has not taken prior steps and has not filed such
application before the learned court below on affidavit. Therefore, in
the aforesaid case the direction was issued to Director General of
Police, U.P. to issue appropriate circular fixing guidelines to the effect
that the investigating officer shall file affidavit before the court
concerned apprising that he has taken all necessary steps seeking
cooperation of the accused but the accused is not cooperating with
the investigation.
10.   In the present case no such affidavit has been filed by the
Investigating Officer and no material was shown to the court-below to
convince that before issuing proclamation all prior necessary
measures have been adopted by the Investigating officer concerned.
11.    The Apex Court in re: Inder Mohan Goswami & another vs.
State of Uttaranchal & others reported in (2007) 12 SCC 1 has
held that coercive process i.e. N.B.W. should not be issued lightly
and it is incumbent upon the Court to verify such fact as to whether
all prior necessory steps have been taken by the investigating officer
or not. Therefore, as per Sri Yadav unless the prior necessary steps,
so prescribed under the Cr.P.C., have not been taken by the
investigating officer, the proclamation u/s 82 and 83 Cr.P.C. should
not have been issued. The relevant paras of Inder Mohan Goswami
(supra) are being reproduced herein below :
51. The issuance of non-bailable warrants involves
interference with personal liberty. Arrest and imprisonment
means deprivation of the most precious right of an individual.
Therefore, the courts have to be extremely careful before
issuing non-bailable warrants.
52. Just as liberty is precious for an individual so is the interest
of the society in maintaining law and order. Both are extremely
important for the survival of a civilized society. Sometimes in
the larger interest of the Public and the State it becomes
absolutely imperative to curtail freedom of an individual for a
certain period, only then the non-bailable warrants should be
issued.
54. As far as possible, if the court is of the opinion that a
summon will suffice in getting the appearance of the accused
in the court, the summon or the bailable warrants should be
preferred. The warrants either bailable or non-bailable should
never be issued without proper scrutiny of facts and complete
application of mind, due to the extremely serious
consequences and ramifications which ensue on issuance of
warrants. The court must very carefully examine whether the
Criminal Complaint or FIR has not been filed with an oblique
motive.‚Äù
12.    Therefore, as per Sri Yadav the proclamation, so issued
against the present applicant is nonest in the eyes of law in view of
the decision of Apex Court in re: Inder Mohan Goswami (supra).
13.    Sri Yadav has further submitted that the present applicant has
filed anticipatory bail application before the learned court-below prior
to issuance of proclamation issued u/s 82 and 83 Cr.P.C. inasmuch
as his anticipatory bail application was filed in the month of April,
2022 and has been rejected on 30.4.2022. The proclamation u/s 82
Cr.P.C. has been issued by the court-below on 9.5.2022. Therefore,
Sri Yadav has submitted that the bar so imposed by Apex Court to
the effect that if the proclamation u/s 82 and 83 Cr.P.C. is issued, no
anticipatory bail application can be entertained would not be
attracted in the instant case inasmuch as when the present applicant
has filed his anticipatory bail application before the court below, there
was no proclamation u/s 82 Cr.P.C. Admittedly, such proclamation is
issued after rejection of his anticipatory bail application by the
learned court below.
14.    The law is trite on the point that, if any person has filed any
anticipatory bail application before the learned court below seeking
anticipatory bail showing his reasonable apprehension of arrest in a
case where the allegations of the prosecution prima facie do not
corroborate with the material available on record and his / her
anticipatory bail application is rejected, he / she has got a right to
approach the High Court for such anticipatory bail and if in the
interregnum period any proclamation u/s 82 & 83 Cr.P.C. is issued, it
may be considered as a circumventive exercise being taken by the
Investigating Officer. No one can be restrained from taking legal
recourse strictly in accordance with law and such legal right may not
be prevented even if any process is adopted by any authority which
is not permissible under the law.
15.    As per Sri Yadav since the present applicant is an Army
personnel and presently posted at Line of Control, China Border, so
the investigating officer / police concerned should have not harassed
him and his family members in an issue wherein the allegations do
not prima facie corroborate with the material available on record.
Therefore, the liberty of the present applicant may be protected in
view of dictum of Apex Court in re: Sushila Aggarwal Vs. State
(NCT of Delhi)-2020 SCC online SC 98.
16.   Per contra, learned AGA has opposed the prayer of
anticipatory bail but could not dispute the factual and legal
submissions of Sri Yadav, learned counsel for the applicant. Learned
AGA has submitted that the investigation is going on.
17.   Heard learned counsel for the parties and perused the material
on record.
18.   The Hon'ble Apex Court in re: State of Madhya Pradesh vs.
Pradeep Sharma reported in (2014) 2 SCC 171 has held that a
person against whom a proclamation has been issued u/s 82/83
Cr.P.C. would not be entitled for the benefit of anticipatory bail.
19.   Considering the aforesaid judgment i.e.: Pradeep Sharma
(supra) the Apex Court in re: Prem Shanker Prasad vs. State of
Bihar (Criminal Appeal No. 1209 of 2021) vide judgment and order
dated October 21,2021 has observed that if anyone is declared as
an absconder / proclaimed offender in terms of section 82 of the
Code (Cr.P.C.), he is not entitled to get the relief of anticipatory bail.
20.   In view of the aforesaid decision of Apex Court in re: Pradeep
Sharma (supra) and Prem Shankar Prasad (supra) if any accused
person is declared absconder by the competent court, he would not
be entitled to get anticipatory bail.
21.   In the present case the record reveals that when the applicant
has filed the anticipatory bail application before the learned court
below there was no proclamation u/s 82 Cr.P.C. Such proclamation
has been issued after the rejection of anticipatory bail application of
the present applicant by the learned court below, therefore, the bar
to   entertain   anticipatory   bail     application after   issuance     of
proclamation u/s 82 Cr.P.C. would not be attracted in the present
22.   The anticipatory bail application can be filed u/s 438 Cr.P.C.
either before the High Court or before the court of sessions.
However, normally a person should approach the Court of sessions
and if the anticipatory bail application is rejected, the High Court can
be approached under same section i.e. section 438 Cr.P.C.
Therefore, for filing anticipatory bail application both the aforesaid
courts have got concurrent powers.
23.    In the present case it appears that when the anticipatory bail
application of the present applicant was rejected on 30.4.2022, an
application for seeking proclamation order was filed by the
Investigating Officer and such order has been issued on 9.5.2022.
Further, the proclamation order dated 9.5.2022 does not disclose
that the investigating officer has filed an affidavit before the learned
court concerned to convince that all prior steps which are required
under the law have been taken; as to whether the summons, bailable
warrant and non-bailable warrant have been served upon the
applicant or not; as to whether before issuing the non-bailable
warrant against the present applicant the learned court below has
convinced itself about the service of summons and bailable warrants.
24.    In the present case the informant / complainant has not leveled
any allegation against the present applicant in the F.I.R. As a matter
of fact, the present applicant is not named in the F.I.R.. It is beyond
any comprehension that if the informant / complainant was having
any grievance, more so genuine grievance against the present
applicant, any sort of allegation would have been leveled in the
F.I.R., therefore, the allegations are subject to the investigation which
is under progress and it is legitimately expected that such
investigation    shall  be   conducted     and    concluded    strictly in
accordance with law.
25.    The Apex Court has restrained the proclaimed offender to seek
anticipatory bail. The person who is not following the process of law
and deliberately avoiding the investigation despite all necessary
steps have been taken by the investigating officer to apprise him to
cooperate with the process of investigation, e.g. summons have
been served but to no avail, thereafter bailable warrants have been
served but again he / she is not cooperating with the investigation for
no plausible and cogent reasons, lastly non-bailable warrant has /
have been served but there is no heed thereon, then the
investigation officer has got no option except to seek proclamation
u/s 82 / 83 Cr.P.C. It is also relevant to note here that the court
concerned must ensure before taking any coercive steps that all the
aforesaid proceed, i.e. summons, bailable warrants and non-bailable
warrants have been duly served upon the person and he / she is
deliberately avoiding the same. Issuing summons, bailable warrant
and non-bailable warrants would not suffice but what is most
important is its service upon the person because unless and until
such process is served no further coercive step should be taken in
view of the dictum of Apex Court in re: Inder Mohan Goswami
(supra) inasmuch as these coercive steps are directly related with
the liberty of the person which is protected under Article 21 of the
Constitution of India.
26.   Therefore, if the aforesaid process is avoided by the person,
any appropriate application for seeking proclamation can be filed by
the investigating officer supporting with an affidavit to apprise the
court concerned as to how despite the summon, bailable warrant
and non-bailable warrant having been served upon the person he /
she is deliberately avoiding to cooperate with the investigation and
the court after having proper satisfaction on the averments of such
application may issue proclamation. Only under these circumstances
that person may be declared as proclaimed offender and his / her
anticipatory bail application should not be heard. In other words,
before filing anticipatory bail that person should be proclaimed
offender and his / her anticipatory bail application will loose the right
of hearing on merits.
27.   In the present case when the applicant filed his anticipatory bail
application, he was not a proclaimed offender. His right to file such
application before this court was consequential as he could have
approached the High Court u/s 438 Cr.P.C. after rejection of his
application by the sessions court which was also filed u/s 438 Cr.P.C.
Therefore, when the present applicant filed his application u/s 438
Cr.P.C. he was not a proclaimed offender so the bar imposed by the
Apex Court entertaining anticipatory bail of the proclaimed offender
would not attract in the present case.
28.    Therefore, in view of what has been considered above and
also in view of dictum of Apex Court in re: Sushila Aggarwal
(supra), I find it appropriate that the liberty of the present applicant
be protected till filing of the police report, u/s 173(2) Cr.P.C. and if
any charge-sheet is filed, the liberty of the present applicant shall be
protected till conclusion of trial.
29.    Having heard learned counsel for the parties and having
perused the material available on record, the present anticipatory
bail application is allowed.
30.    Therefore, it is directed that in the event of arrest, applicant-
Manish Yadav shall be released on anticipatory bail in the aforesaid
case crime number on his furnishing a personal bond of Rs. 50,000/-
with two sureties each in the like amount to the satisfaction of the
arresting authority/ court concerned with the following conditions:-
1. that the applicant shall make himself available for interrogation by a
police officer as and when required;
2. that the applicant shall not, directly or indirectly make any inducement,
threat or promise to any person acquainted with the facts of the case so
as to dissuade him from disclosing such facts to the court or to any police
officer or tamper with the evidence;
3. that the applicant shall not leave India without the previous permission
4. that in default of any of the conditions mentioned above, the
investigating officer shall be at liberty to file appropriate application for
cancellation of anticipatory bail granted to the applicant;
5. that in case charge-sheet is submitted the applicant shall not tamper
with the evidence during the trial;
6. that the applicant shall not pressurize/ intimidate the prosecution
7. that the applicant shall appear before the trial court on each date fixed
unless personal presence is exempted;
8. that in case of breach of any of the above conditions the court below
shall have the liberty to cancel the bail.
