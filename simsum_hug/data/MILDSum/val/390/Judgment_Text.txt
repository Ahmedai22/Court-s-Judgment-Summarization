(The judgment is pronounced in terms of Chapter VII Sub-rule (2) of
Rule (1) of the Allahabad High Court Rules, 1952 by Hon'ble Ramesh
1.         This   criminal    appeal   has    been    preferred   by    the   sole
appellant/convict Mohammad Aslam against the judgment and order dated
30.01.2004 passed by Additional District and Sessions Judge, Fast Track
Court No.5, District Hardoi in Sessions Trial No.241 of 2002, Crime No.318
of 2001 under Section 302 of the Indian Penal Code, 1861 (in short IPC),
Police Station Mallawan District Hardoi, whereby the appellant has been held
guilty under Section 302 of I.P.C. and sentenced with life imprisonment
coupled with a fine of Rs.10,000/- and in default of payment of fine further
imprisonment of two years.
2.         The facts in short necessary for disposal of this appeal are as under:-
(i)        A First Information Report (in short F.I.R.) was registered on
22.12.2001 at Case Crime No. 318 of 2001, under Section 302 of I.P.C. at
Police Station Mallawan, District Hardoi in pursuance of the order passed by
the learned Chief Judicial Magistrate, Hardoi on the application moved by the
complainant Abdul Sattar under Section 156(3) Cr.P.C.. It was stated in the
application/F.I.R. that Khairunnisa sister of the complainant was married to
Mohammad Salis resident of village Purvayan, Police Station Mallawan,
District Hardoi. Mohammad Aslam is the real brother of his brother-in-law
Mohammad Salis. There was dispute regarding money between his brother-
in-law and Salis Mohammad Aslam, because Mohammad Salis lended a sum
of Rs.25,000/- to Mohammad Aslam during the season of potato crop.
Mohammad Aslam was not returning the money alleging loss. Whenever he
(complainant) used to ask about his own Rs.10,000/- from Mohammad Salis,
then Mohammad Salis used to reply that whenever Mohammad Aslam would
return the money he would pay him (complainant). Mohammad Salis told the
complainant that whenever he asked about the money, Mohammad Aslam
made excuses and threatened to kill.
(ii)       On 13.01.2001 in the noon Mohd. Aslam brought Buffalo meat and
gave to Khairunnisa the sister of the complainant to cook. After handing over
the meat he went out of the house on pretext of some urgent work. After
eating that meat Mohammad Salis brother-in-law of complainant, sister
Khairunnisa, nephew Ajmeri and niece Gulshan died. Ajmeri and Gulshan
died on way to Mallawan, whereas Mohd. Salis and Khairunnisa died in
Hardoi. He (complainant) met his sister and brother-in-law in Mallawan
because at that time he was in Mallalawan. It was told by his sister and
brother-in-law that Mohammad Aslam mixed poison in the meat for the
reason he did not want to return the money. Before this incident Mohammad
Aslam left his wife in her paternal home. He informed about the incident at
police station Mallawan but no action was taken. He further informed many
higher officers, but no action was taken. Therefore he moved an application
under section 156 (3) of Cr.P.C and requested to lodge the FIR.
(iii)       It is evident from the record that on 13.01.2001 the police of Police
Station Mallawan District Hardoi prepared inquest reports of all the four
deceased persons on the information received from District Hospital Hardoi.
The name of the persons who gave information is Krishna Kumar the ward
boy of District Hospital Hardoi. This fact has been mentioned in the inquest
report of all the four persons. After preparing the inquest reports police
prepared the necessary documents and sent the dead bodies for postmortem
examination. The police also reached at the spot and seized some part of the
meat found inside the house of the deceased persons and prepared the
recovery memo of the same.
(iv)        After registration of the FIR, further investigation started and the
Investigating Officer prepared the site plan of the place of incident and
recorded the statements of the witnesses and submitted the chargesheet against
the accused appellant under section 302 of I.P.C. for killing the
aforementioned four deceased persons. The concerned Magistrate after taking
cognizance on the chargesheet committed the case to the Court of Sessions for
trial, who in turn transferred the case for trial to the Additional Sessions Judge
for trial. The Additional Sessions Judge framed charge under section 302 of
The accused person denied the crime and claimed to be tried. The
prosecution in order to prove its case examined the following witnesses:-
(a) P.W. 1 Abdul Sattar, the complainant.
(c) P.W. 3 Doctor C.P. Rawat, who conducted the postmortem examination.

(vi)      After close of prosecution evidence, the statement of the accused
Mohammad Aslam was recorded under section 313 of the Code of Criminal
Procedure 1973 (in short Cr.P.C.). The accused denied all the allegations
leveled against him and stated that Abdul Sattar, the complainant came to him
to demand the money and threatened that if money will not be given he will
lodge the FIR. He lodged the FIR for the reason that he did not pay the money
demanded. In defence one witness DW-1 Mohammad Anis was examined.
Thereafter the learned trial court after hearing the arguments of both the sides
and analyzing the evidences available on record reached at the conclusion that
prosecution has proved all the circumstances which leads to the conclusion
that accused Aslam committed the crime. It has also concluded that all the
circumstances cumulatively prove that accused has committed the crime and
finally concluded that prosecution has established the prosecution story
beyond all reasonable doubts by the evidence adduced especially the medical
evidence and expert evidence. The learned trial court held the accused guilty
under section 302 of I.P.C. and sentenced him with imprisonment for life
coupled with a fine of Rs.10,000/- and in default of payment of fine further
imprisonment of two years.
(vii)     Being aggrieved of this conviction and sentence this appeal has been
preferred by the convict/appellant.
(viii)    The appellant/convict had challenged the impugned judgment and
order mainly on the ground that the occurrence took place on 13.09.2001, but
the FIR was lodged on 20.12.2001 at about 14:10 hours, on the application of
Abdul Sattar, who is the real brother of Khairunnisa. None of the close
relatives of deceased Mohammad Salis or a person living nearby had lodged
the FIR. Abdul Sattar, the complainant has cooked up a story that Mohammad
Salis has given Rs.25,000/- to the appellant for potato business in which he
has also given Rs.10,000/- who is brother in law of Mohammad Salis and the
same was demanded by him but the appellant has not given the same. Among
the prosecution witnesses Sirajuddin and Nafis Ahmed had turned hostile and
only Abdul Sattar has stated about the incident and that too in contradictory
manner which is not reliable. The finding of the learned trial court is against
the law and facts both and the impugned judgment and order of the trial court
is based on surmises and conjectures.
(3)         Heard Mr R.B.S. Rathour, Advocate Amicus Curiae for the
convict/appellant and Mr. Umesh Chandra Verma, learned Additional
Government Advocate (in short A.G.A.) for the State.
(4)         Learned counsel for the convict/appellant argued that this case is
based on circumstantial evidence, as there is no eye-witness of the incident.
There was no chance to state about the incident by Khairunnisa and
Mohammad Salis to Abdul Sattar, as Abdul Sattar reached when all the four
persons were dead. P.W.-4 Raees Ahmad and PW-5 Sirajuddin have turned
hostile. PW-1 Abdul Sattar, the complainant has given a contradictory
statement and is not trustworthy. He further argued that prosecution has failed
to prove the chain of circumstantial evidence beyond reasonable doubt. In fact
there is no evidence against the convict appellant therefore the impugned
judgment and order should be set-aside and the convict/appellant be released.
He relied upon following case laws:-
(1) Sharad Birdhichand Sarda Vs. State of of Maharashtra AIR 1984
(2.) Ramgopal Vs. State of Maharashtra, AIR 1972 (SC) 656.
(5)        Contrary to it learned A.G.A. opposed the submissions made by
learned Amicus Curiae and submitted that the strong motive was there to
commit the crime and the poison was found in the meat tested in the Forensic
Science Lab and also in the Viscera preserved of the diseased persons. Hence
the appeal deserves dismissal and should be dismissed.
(6)         Considered the arguments of both the sides, perused the evidence
available on record and also the impugned judgment and order, and gone
through the case law cited by the learned Amicus Curiae.
(7)        This case is based on circumstantial evidence, as there is not eye-
witness of the crime. The principle governing the appreciation of evidence
based on circumstantial evidence have been summarized by the Hon'ble Apex
Court in Sharad Birdhichand Sarda Vs. State of of Maharashtra (supra)
cited by the learned Amicus Curiae and have been reiterated in catena of cases
by the Hon'ble Apex Court. Recently the Hon'ble Apex Court in this regard in
the case of Shivaji Chintappa Patil Vs. State of Maharashtra reported in
(2021) 5 SCC 626, has laid down as under ( para 12 ):-
"12. The law with regard to conviction on the basis of circumstantial evidence
has been very well crystalised in the judgment of this Court in Sharad
Birdhichand Sarda v. State of Maharashtra :-(SCC p.185, paras 153-54)
"153. A close analysis of this decision would show that the following
conditions must be fulfilled before a case against an accused can be said to be
(1) the circumstances from which the conclusion of guilt is to be drawn should
be fully established.
It may be noted here that this Court indicated that the circumstances
concerned "must or should" and not "may be" established. There is not only a
grammatical but a legal distinction between "may be proved" and "must be or
should be proved" as was held by this Court in Shivaji Sahabrao Bobade v.
State of Maharashtra where the observations were made: [SCC p. 807 : para
"19. .....Certainly, it is a primary principle that the accused must be and not
merely may be guilty before a court can convict and the mental distance
between "may be" and "must be" is long and divides vague conjectures from
sure conclusions."
(2) the facts so established should be consistent only with the hypothesis of the
guilt of the accused, that is to say, they should not be explainable on any other
hypothesis except that the accused is guilty,
(3) the circumstances should be of a conclusive nature and tendency,
4) they should exclude every possible hypothesis except the one to be proved,
(5) there must be a chain of evidence so complete as not to leave any
reasonable ground for the conclusion consistent with the innocence of the
accused and must show that in all human probability the act must have been
done by the accused.
154. These five golden principles, if we may say so, constitute the panchsheel
of the proof of a case based on circumstantial evidence."
(8)        In short in order to prove the crime based on circumstantial evidence
all the circumstances must indicate that the author of the crime is the accused
and the accused alone and there is no possibility of being committed the crime
by anybody else. The chain of the circumstances should be complete and no
shadow of reasonable doubt must be there. In the present matter admittedly
there is no eye witness of the crime as nobody has come to say that he saw the
accused committing the crime. The FIR of the crime was lodged in pursuance
of an order passed on an application moved under Section 156(3) of Cr.P.C.
by the brother of deceased Khairunnisa. It is also undisputed that the death of
all the four deceased persons resulted due to poison Thayodon (Organochloro)
insecticide poison as found in the viscera preserved of Salis and (Fairoom)
Khairunnisa. The viscera reports of Salis as Exhibit Ka-36 and Exhibit Ka-37
are on record.
In order to prove the murder by poisoning the prosecution had to
establish the following three essentials:-
(c) The accused had opportunity to administer poison to the deceased.
(9) In the case in hand, it is undisputed that all the four deceased persons died
of poison as has been reported by the Forensic Science Laboratory in viscera
examination reports, hence first ingredient is proved. Now comes the second
ingredient, whether Mohd. Aslam the appellant/convict had poison in his
possession. In this regard there is no reliable evidence on record. The P.W.1
has only stated that when he met Mohd. Aslam in the bus he was carrying
meat and a bottle of medicine. When he asked Mohd. Aslam about bottle he
answered that it was a Cough Syrup. No other evidence is there to show that
Mohd. Aslam had poison in his possession. There is no evidence on record
that bottle which Mohd. Aslam carried on the pretext of cough syrup was
containing poison. Even there is no evidence to prove that Mohd. Aslam
handed over the meat pieces to Khairunnisa the deceased and mixed that
cough syrup in that meat. Hence, the second ingredient is not proved by the
prosecution. Now comes the third ingredients, whether Mohd. Aslam had
opportunity to administer poison to the deceased person. There is allegation in
the FIR lodged by Abdul Sattar brother of the deceased lady Khairunnisa and
brother-in-law of deceased Mohd. Salis and maternal uncle of two deceased
children, that Mohd. Aslam brought meat and gave the same to Khairunnisa to
cook that and when the meat was being cooked he mixed some poison in that
meat and after consuming that meat all the four persons died. Admittedly the
complainant Abdul Sattar was not present at the time of alleged bringing of
meat and mixing the poison or handing over the meat to the deceased lady.
None other witness could be produced who saw the accused, handing over the
meat to the deceased lady or mixing the poison or atleast saying that he saw
the poison in the possession of the convict-Aslam.
(10)        Prosecution has emphasized on the statement of Abdul Sattar
(P.W.1 Complainant), wherein he has stated that his deceased sister and
brother-in-law told him before death, while Adbul Sattar was taking them to
Hospital in Hardoi that Mohd. Aslam brought meat and gave it to her deceased
sister to cook up alongwith spices. While meat was being cooked, Mohd.
Aslam poured some poison in the pot and that was witnessed by his deceased
sister. Upon scrutiny of evidence of Abdul Sattar        it is surfaced that he
received information about the serious condition of his sister, brother-in-law
and their two children. On this he went to Mallawan, but the doctors at
Mallawan asked to take them to Hospital at Hardoi. When he was carrying
them to Hardoi, on the way his sister told him that Mohd. Aslam gave meat
alongwith spices to cook and poured some poison in the meat while meat was
being cooked. In this regard this witness has given the contradictory statement.
At one place he said that his sister and brother-in-law had already died when
he reached, at another place he stated that they were alive. Further he said that
his brother-in-law was dead but sister was alive. Further more Defence
Witness (D.W.1) Mohd. Anis has said that Abdul Sattar was not with him
when he carried the deceased persons to Hardoi. Thus the testimony of P.W. 1
Abadul Sattar is not trustworthy. There is nothing on record to establish that
the convict Mohd. Aslam brought meat alongwith spices and handed over to
Khairunnisa for cooking and mixed some poison when the meat was being
(11)       Thus the prosecution has failed to prove the circumstances leading
towards the conclusion that the appellant/convict killed all the four deceased
persons by administering poison in meat. There is no reliable evidence to
establish that Mohd. Aslam brought meat and spices and handed over to the
deceased lady to cook. There is no reliable evidence that Mohd. Aslam had
poison in his possession and there is no trustworthy and cogent evidence to
prove that Mohd. Aslam mixed some poison in the meat while the meat was
being cooked.
(12)       The evidence on record is not of such a quality that we can
unhesitatingly hold that the death of deceased persons were result of
administration of poison by the convict/appellant. In other words the
prosecution has failed to prove that Mohd. Aslam brought meat alongwith
spices and handed over to Khairunnisa to cook and mixed the poison in the
meat at the time of cooking.
(13)       It is painful for this Court to note that four persons of the family
were done to death by poisoning but the real culprit of the crime could not be
brought to book. So far as the appellant-accused Mohd. Aslam is concerned
the prosecution has failed to conclusively establish by cogent evidence that it
was the accused/appellant who committed the murder of four deceased.
(14)       Hence the impugned judgment and order deserves to be set-aside
and is set-aside.
(15)       The appeal is allowed. The appellant is in jail. He shall be released
forthwith, if not required in any other case.
(16)            Appellant Mohd. Aslam is directed to file personal bond and two
sureties each in the like amount to the satisfaction of the court concerned in
compliance with Section 437-A of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973.
(17)            Before we part with the case, we must candidly express our
unreserved and uninhibited appreciation for the assistance rendered by Mr.
R.B.S.Rathaur, Amicus Curiae for the convict-appellant, therefore, we deem it
appropriate to direct for payment to Mr.R.B.S.Rathaur, learned Amicus Curiae
for his valuable assistance as per Rules of the Court.
(18)            Office is directed to pay remuneration to Mr.R.B.S.Rathaur, learned
Amicus Curiae as per Rules of the Court within a month.
(19)            Let a copy of this order alongwith original record be transmitted to
the trial court concerned forthwith for necessary information and follow
action.
