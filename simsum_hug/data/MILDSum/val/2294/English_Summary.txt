Noting that there is no uniform format of bail orders across the High Courts, the Supreme Court has directed the High Courts to ensure that basic essentials are recorded in them.
In many instances, the orders do not mention the proceedings pending before the trial court there or the nature of offences in the case. In this backdrop, a bench comprising Justices S Ravindra Bhat and Dipankar Datta ordered :

"This Court is of the opinion that in bail/anticipatory bail matters, High Courts should endeavour to ensure that all basic essentials (i.e. FIR No., Date, the concerned police station and the offences allegedly committed etc.) are duly recorded or reflected in the format of the order".
 This order shall be circulated to all the High Courts through their Registrars, the bench further directed.
