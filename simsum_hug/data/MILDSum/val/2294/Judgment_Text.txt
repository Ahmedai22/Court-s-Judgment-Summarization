The petitioner was denied anticipatory bail. A First Information Report was lodged
alleging that he had committed offences under Sections 366, 376A 342 and other offences
under the Indian Penal Code. After investigation, a final report was filed which absolved
him of involvement in any crime. The competent court directed registration of an FIR and

After considering the submission of parties, this Court is of the opinion that having
regard to the peculiar circumstances of this case, the petitioner deserves to be enlarged
on anticipatory bail, subject to such terms and conditions as the trial court may impose.
We notice that in this case, there is no mention of the offences the petitioner is charged
Before parting with this case, this Court notices that the format of orders by various
High Courts in bail proceedings differs significantly. In many instances, the orders do not
contain any description of the proceedings pending before the trial court there; at times,
no advertence to the nature of the offence alleged in the FIR etc. This Court is of the
opinion that in bail/anticipatory bail matters, High Courts should endeavour to ensure that
all basic essentials (i.e. FIR No., Date, the concerned police station and the offences
allegedly committed etc.) are duly recorded or reflected in the format of the order. This
order shall be circulated to all the High Courts through their Registrars.
The special leave petition is disposed of.
