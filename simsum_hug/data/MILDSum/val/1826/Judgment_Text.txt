The matter is listed for consideration on charge today. I have heard
arguments advanced at bar by both the sides and perused the entire material on
2.     (i)    The facts of the case in brief required for the present are that FIR in
the matter was registered on 04.03.2020 on a written complaint dated 01.03.2020,
made by Brijpal, S/o Shri Binda Prasad, wherein he stated that his rented shop by
the name of “Kapil Rickshaw Battery”, bearing No.A­5 (adjacent to Priyanka
Copy House), situated in Chaman Park, in front of DRP Public School, main
Brijpuri Road, Delhi­110094 was looted by the riotous mob on 25.02.2020 at
(ii)   Thereafter, during the course of investigation, on 05.04.2020, IO
clubbed two more complaints (both dated 24.02.2020), made by Shri Diwan
Singh, S/o Shri Dashrath Singh regarding breaking opening the shutters and loot
at his two shops, i.e shop No.4 (Shivam Cycle Store) and shop No.5 (Shivam
General Store), situated at main Brijpuri Road, Chaman Park by the riotous mob
3.            The learned defence counsel(s) have made a strong pitch by
submitting that there is no incriminating material available on record against the
accused persons and as such they are entitled for discharge in the matter on
(i)   It is argued that the accused persons have been falsely implicated in
the matter by the investigating agency, being resident(s) of the same
area/locality. Their false implication is further evident from the fact that
there is an “unexplained delay” of about eight (08) days in registration of
FIR, as the alleged incident took place on 25.02.2020; whereas, the case
FIR in the matter was registered on 04.03.2020.
(ii)   Both the complainants have neither specifically named any of the
accused persons in their respective written complaints nor any specific role
has been assigned to them in the matter. Even complainant Brij Pal has
not named the accused persons in his two supplementary statements dated
04.03.2020 and 09.04.2020 respectively. As a sequel thereto, it is
contended that at the instance of investigating agency, complainant Diwan
Singh had later on falsely implicated accused persons namely Mohd.
Shahnawaz @ Shanu, Ashraf Ali, Rashid @ Raja and Mohd. Faisal vide
his supplementary statement recorded under Section 161 Cr.P.C in the
matter on 09.04.2020, which is neither here nor there. No recovery of any
sort has been effected from any of the accused persons.
(iii)  It is further argued that accused persons were initially arrested in
case FIR No.39/2020, PS Gokalpuri (Dilbar Negi murder case) and
thereafter merely on the basis of disclosure statement(s) made by them in
the said case, their arrest has been formally effected in the instant matter.
(iv)   It is contended that the police has wrongly clubbed two incidents of
different dates in the matter, in as much as the alleged incident as per
complaint(s) made by complainant Diwan Singh occurred on 24.02.2020;
whereas, as per complaint of Brijpal his shop was looted by the riotous
mob on 25.02.2020. The FIR in the matter should have been registered on
the complaint(s) dated 24.02.2020 of Diwan Singh and not on the
complaint dated 01.03.2020, made by complainant Brij Pal.
(v)    It is next contended that even the four public witnesses namely
Pawan Singh, Sharad Singh, Vipin and Mahesh, all of whom had made call
at number 100 on the date of incident(s) have not specifically named any
of the accused persons vide their respective statement(s) recorded under
Section 161 Cr.P.C on 09.07.2020.
(vi)   It is next contended that Constable Sanjay, Constable Vipin and HC
Hari Babu are “planted witnesses” because if they had witnessed the
incident, then why they didn’t report the matter to the Police Station on
24.02.2020 itself and waited till the recording of their alleged statements
under Section 161 Cr.P.C on 08.04.2020 by the IO. No cogent/plausible
explanation for the delay in recording the statements of said police
witnesses has come from the side of prosecution.
(vii) Lastly, it is very strenuously argued that there is no electronic
evidence available against the accused persons in the form of CCTV
footage/video­clip to nail their presence at the spot/SOC at the relevant
time .
4.            Per contra, the learned Special PP for the State has very vehemently
argued that on 24.02.2020 some unscrupulous elements had hatched a large scale
conspiracy and carried out riots in the area of North­East District of Delhi. The
communal riots continued for two days unabated, resulting in large number of
deaths of innocent persons and loss of property worth crores of rupees. It is
submitted that initially all the accused persons were arrested in case FIR
No.39/2020, PS Gokalpuri and thereafter their formal arrest was effected in the
instant matter.
5.            The evidence available against the accused persons has been
(a) Role of accused         They have been found to be “active members of the
persons                     riotous mob” on the date and time of incident that
took active participation in rioting, vandalizing and
arson in the area/locality in question on the date(s)
and time of incident.
(b) Ocular evidence         (i) Complainant Diwan Singh vide his supplementary
statement dated 09.04.2020 had categorically named/
identified four accused persons namely Mohd.
Shahnawaz @ Shanu, Ashraf Ali, Rashid @ Raja and
Mohd.Faisal in the matter.
categorically named/identified by PW Shyam Sunder
vide his statement recorded under Section 161 Cr.P.C
on 10.04.2020.
(iii) Furthermore, the presence of accused persons at
the spot/SOC on the date(s) and time of incident(s)
(No.1840/NE), Constable Sanjay (No.1988/NE) and
Constable Vipin (No.1997/NE), vide their statements
recorded under Section 161 Cr.P.C in the matter on
87.04.2020. The said police witnesses were lying
posted as “Beat Officers” in the area/locality in
question at the relevant time.
(c) Technical Evidence       The CDR location qua the mobile phones of accused
persons have been found near the spot/SOC at the
relevant time.
(d)    Involvement      in   Besides the case in hand, all the accused persons are
other cases                  involved in several other cases of rioting in the area,
including case FIR No.39/2020, PS Gokalpuri
(Dilbar Negi murder case).
6.     (i)    As regards the contention of the learned counsel(s) that there is a
delay in recording of FIR in the matter, it is argued that the riots at or around the
scene of crime were “very fierce” from 23.02.2020 till 26.02.2020. Several
persons were injured; public and private property(ies) worth crores of rupees
were vandalized, arsoned and torched. There was curfew like atmosphere at or
around the area. The police officials of PS Gokalpuri remained busy in law and
order duty and as such, delay in recording of FIRs took place.
(ii)   As regards the complainants not specifically naming the accused
persons in their respective written complaints, it is submitted that same is not of
much significance as complainant Diwan Singh has categorically named four
accused persons vide his supplementary statement dated 09.04.2020. Even PW
Shyam Sunder has categorically identified the accused persons vide his statement
dated 10.04.2020 and the same finds corroboration from the statements of police
witnesses recorded in the matter, who were lying posted as ‘Beat Officers” in the
area/locality in question at the relevant time. As a sequel thereto, it is contended
that the peculiarity of North­East Delhi communal riots is such that the
“atmosphere of terror” remained for weeks together, people were highly scared
and it may be possible that due to highly surcharged and tense atmosphere,
complainant(s) might have got scared and could not name the accused persons in
their initial written complaints. At the same time, it is also contended that this is
not the appropriate stage to dwell upon the said issue and the same would be
taken care of during the course of trial.
7.            Lastly, it is submitted that at the stage of consideration on charge,
the court is not supposed to meticulously judge the evidence collected by the
investigating agency and has to take prima facie view thereupon.
8.             I have given thoughtful consideration to the arguments advanced at
bar by both the sides. I have also carefully gone through the chargesheet filed in
the matter.
9.             The law with regard to framing of charge is fairly settled now. In
the case of “Kallu Mal Gupta V/s State”, 2000 I AD Delhi 107, it was held that
while deciding the question of framing of charge in a criminal case, the Court is
not to apply exactly the standard and test which it finally applied for determining
the guilt or otherwise. This being the initial stage of the trial, the court is not
supposed to decide whether the materials collected by the investigating agency
provides sufficient ground for conviction of the accused or whether the trial is
sure to culminate in his conviction. What is required to be seen is whether
there is strong suspicion which may lead to the court to think that there is
ground for presuming that the accused has committed an offence.
10.            Furthermore, in case titled as, “Umar Abdula Sakoor Sorathia V/s
Intelligence Officer Narcotic Control Bureau”, JT 1999 (5) SC 394 it was
held that, “it is well settled that at the stage of framing charge, the Court is not
expected to go deep into the probative value of the materials on record. If on the
basis of materials on record, the court could come to the conclusion that the
accused would have committed the offence, the court is obliged to frame the
charge and proceed to the trial”.
11.            It is well­settled law that at the time of framing of charge the FIR
and the material collected by the investigating agency cannot be sieved through
the cull ender of the finest gauzes to test its veracity. A roving inquiry into the
pros and cons of the case by weighing the evidence is not expected or even
warranted at the stage of framing of charge (reliance Sapna Ahuja V/s State”,
1999V AD Delhi p 407).
12.            Now, reverting back to the case in hand.       A careful perusal of the
chargesheet filed in the matter reveals that sections 147/148/149/436/454/392/
452/188/153­A/427/506 IPC have been invoked therein.              It is relevant to note
that except for section 436 IPC, all the sections invoked in the matter are
exclusively triable by learned Magistrate. Now, let us see whether ingredients of
Section 436 IPC are made out in the matter or not. Before that, it would be
appropriate to have the definition of Section 436 IPC, which for ready reference
Section 436­ Mischief by fire or explosive substance
with intent to destroy house, etc.—Whoever commits
mischief by fire or any explosive substance, intending to
cause, or knowing it to be likely that he will thereby
cause, the destruction of any building which is
ordinarily used as a place of worship or as a human
dwelling or as a place for the custody of property, shall
be punished with [imprisonment for life], or with
imprisonment of either description for a term which may
extend to ten years, and shall also be liable to fine.
13.     (i)   The case FIR in the matter was registered on 04.03.2020, on the
basis of a written complaint dated 01.03.2020, made by complainant Birjpal, S/o
Shri Binda Prasad. I have carefully gone through the aforesaid written complaint.
In his said complaint, he has merely stated that his rented shop by the name of
“Kapil Rickshaw Battery”, bearing No.A­5 (adjacent to Priyanka Copy House),
situated in Chaman Park, in front of DRP Public School, main Brijpuri Road,
Delhi­110094 was looted by the riotous mob on 25.02.2020 at about 9.30 PM. It
is relevant to note here that date (25.02.2020) and time (at about 9.30 PM) has
been added/inserted later on by a different ink in the said complaint. Even no
initials of complainant Brij Pal are there on the said addendum. The said
complainant has not stated a single word regarding committing mischief by
fire or explosive substance by the riotous mob in his aforesaid shop on
25.02.2020, i.e on the date of incident. Even in his supplementary
statement(s) dated 04.03.2020 and 09.04.2020, he has not stated a single word
regarding putting on fire of his shop by the riotous mob.              As such, the
ingredients of Section 436 IPC are not at all made out either from written
complaint of aforesaid complainant or from his supplementary statement(s)
recorded under Section 161 Cr.P.C.
(ii)  Now, coming to the other two complaints, both dated 24.02.2020,
made by another complainant Diwan Singh, S/o Dashrath Singh regarding
breaking open the shutters and looting of his two shops, i.e shop No.4 (Shivam
Cycle Store) and shop No.5 (Shivam General Store), situated at main Brijpuri
Road, Chaman Park by the riotous mob on 24.02.2020. A careful reading of both
his aforesaid complaints clearly and unerringly reveals that even he has not stated
a single word therein which could attract the ingredients of Section 436 IPC.
This is not be all and end all in the matter. A glaring fact which is worth
mentioning here is that in the body of said two complaints, complainant Diwan
Singh has categorically mentioned that when he visited his aforesaid shops on
25.02.2020, he found the shutters thereof broken and articles looted by the
riotous mob and few articles taken outside and put on fire in front of his Shivam
General Store; whereas, in the heading/subject he mentions the date of incident as
24.02.2020. This Court is not able to comprehend as to how he could prefer the
said complaint(s) to police on 24.02.2020 when he himself had visited his shops
on 25.02.2020, meaning thereby that prior to his visit to the shops on 25.02.2020
he was not aware about the fate thereof. Secondly, when both the aforesaid
complaints had reached to the police prior in time on 24.02.2020, then why FIR
was not registered on these two complaints and instead the same was registered
on the complaint of Brij Pal, dated 01.03.2020. No explanation in this regard has
been provided by the investigating agency in the entire chargesheet. This Court
is further not able to comprehend as to how an incident which took place on
24.02.2020 can be clubbed with the incident which occurred on 25.02.2020,
unless and until there is clear evidence to the effect that same unlawful assembly
of rioters was operating on both the aforesaid dates and there has to be specific
witnesses in this regard.        These are a few questions/queries which the
investigating agency has to answer during the course of trial.
(iii) Be that as it may, as regards the complainant Diwan Singh naming
accused persons in his supplementary statement and narrating the incident of
putting on fire his Shivam General Store and first floor where spare­parts of
bicycles were being kept, I am afraid that the investigating agency cannot cover
up the said flaw by way of recording the supplementary statements of
complainant(s), if the ingredients of Section 436 IPC were not there in their
initial written complaints made to the police. This Court is conscious of the fact
that cases of communal riots have to be considered with utmost sensitivity, but
that does not mean that the common sense should be given go­by; mind has to be
applied even at this stage with regard to the material available on record. In case
reported as, “2004 SCC Online Del 961”, titled as, “Deepa Bajwa V/s State &
Ors.”, Hon’ble High Court of Delhi has been pleased to observe as under:
6. After considering the submissions made by learned
counsel for the parties, this Court is of the considered
view that a complaint, on the basis of which the
complainant seeks registration of an F.I.R., must disclose
essential ingredients of the offence and in case a
complaint lacks or is wanting in any of the essential
ingredients, the lacuna or deficiency cannot be filled up
by obtaining additional complaint or supplementary
statement and thereafter proceed to register the F.I.R. If
such a course is permitted, it would give undue latitude
as well as opportunity to unscrupulous complainants to
nail others by hook or by crook in spite of the fact that
their initial complaint does not make out the offence
complained of. Such a course would be utter abuse of the
process of law. First version as disclosed in a complaint
is always important for adjudicating as to whether an
accused has committed or not an offence. In the
complaint dated 19th April, 2001, the Complainant
himself alleged that the Councillor Chhannu Mal was
introducing him to the petitioner. If that was the case,
how could he say later that on that day the petitioner
knew that he was a Scheduled Caste. This statement,
therefore, was a crude falsity introduced at the behest of
the police to implicate the petitioner under Section 3 of
the Act. This effort on the part of the police to supply the
deficiency and cover up a lacuna in the complaint in
view of legal opinion was totally unwarranted and an
abuse of the process of law.
(iv)   In another case reported as, “2008 (2) JCC 979”, titled as,
“Rajender Singh Sachdeva V/s State (NCT) of Delhi” has been pleased to
13. If these and other surrounding circumstances are
taken into consideration the complaint of the petitioner
complainant, the incident in which the petitioner was
involved occurred some time in April­May 1988, i.e 16
years before the complaint. He was not named in the
FIR. That incident is also absent in the first report
documented during investigation, i.e a complaint to the
Assistant Labour Commissioner. The allegations against
the petitioner surfaced only during the statement under
section 161. Interestingly, he was named in that. The
third statement was recorded on 21.05.2004. In the
meanwhile, the petitioner was arrested on 18.05.2004.
One does not find any logic as to the recording of the
second statement under Section 161 except as a
explanation by the complainant regarding identity and
knowledge of the petitioner’s name. If this is seen in the
background of absence of any mention of the petitioner
in the FIR, the tenuousness of the link with allegations
against him become apparent.
15. Now, it is well established by series of judgments
of the Supreme Court commencing from Union of India
V/s Prafulla Kumar Samal, AIR 1979 SC 366 onwards
that charges can be framed against an accused if the
materials, i.e documentary and oral evidence show his
prima facie involvemenet and existence of a grave
suspicion in that regard. The materials sought to be
pressed into service by the prosecution in this case for
the charge under Section 120B do not inspire such
confidence as to be termed as disclosing grave suspicion
of his involvement. Another principle which has been
recognized by the Courts is that if two views are
possible, the one favouring the accused should be
preferred at the charge framing stage. In this case, the
entirety of evidence are the two Section 161 Cr.P.C
statements of the complainant. There are no objective
material or circumstantial evidence supporting the
statements in the form of seizure of articles etc. In this
background, it is clear that there are two views possible.
Therefore, applying the rule enunciated in “Dilawar
Balu Karane V/s State of Maharashtra”, 2002 (2) SCC
135, the interpretation favouring the petitioner has to be
accepted.
(v)    Furthermore, in case reported as, “(2002) 2 SCC 135”, titled as,
“Dilawar Balu Kurane V/s State of Maharashtra”, the Hon’ble Supreme
12. Now the next question is whether a prima facie case
has been made out against the appellant. In exercising
powers under Section 227 of the Code of Criminal
Procedure, the settled position of law is that the Judge
while considering the question of framing the charges
under the said section has the undoubted power to sift
and weigh the evidence for the limited purpose of finding
out whether or not a prima facie case against the
accused has been made out; where the materials placed
before the court disclose grave suspicion against the
accused which has not been properly explained the court
will be fully justified in framing a charge and proceeding
with the trial; by and large if two views are equally
possible and the Judge is satisfied that the evidence
produced before him while giving rise to some suspicion
but not grave suspicion against the accused, he will be
fully justified to discharge the accused, and in exercising
jurisdiction under Section 227 of the Code of Criminal
Procedure, the Judge cannot act merely as a post office
or a mouthpiece of the prosecution, but has to consider
the broad probabilities of the case, the total effect of the
evidence and the documents produced before the court
but should not make a roving enquiry into the pros and
cons of the matter and weigh the evidence as if he was
conducting a trial [Union of India versus Prafulla
(vi)   Further, section 436 IPC cannot be invoked merely on the basis of
statements (dated 08.04.2020) of police witnesses namely HC Hari Babu,
Constable Sanjay and Constable Vipin, who were lying posted as “Beat
Officers” in the area/locality in question on the date of incident(s), as when both
the complainants aforesaid had stated nothing in this regard, then the statements
of said police witnesses have no significance. There is also a considerable delay
in recording of their statements.
14.           In view of the aforesaid discussion, I am of the considered view that
ingredients of Section 436 IPC are not at all made out from the material produced
on record by the investigating agency. Except Section 436 IPC, all the offences
invoked in the matter are exclusively triable by the court of learned Magistrate.
15.           Accordingly, the case file be placed before learned Chief
Metropolitan Magistrate (North­East), Karkardooma District Courts on
28.09.2021 at 2.00 p.m. with a request to either try the matter himself or assign it
to some other competent Court/learned MM. Accused persons be produced
physically before learned CMM (North­East) on the said date.
16.           A copy of this order be sent to learned counsel(s) for the accused
persons as well as to Superintendent Jail concerned.
