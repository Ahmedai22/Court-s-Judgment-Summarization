1.     The petitioner challenges the legality and validity of the
rejection order passed by the Director of Elementary
Education,    Orissa   dated    14.02.2022    for   Inter-District
transferring and prays for quashing of the same on the
ground that no inter seniority can be fixed on the basis of
date of birth of the employees instead of their valid date of
joining.
2. The petitioner was initially appointed as a Sikshya Sahayak
on 02.04.2011 and posted under DI. Jharsuguda. As per the
office order dated 07.05.2018 of the DEO, Jharsuguda the
service of the petitioner was regularized as Level-V Asst.
Teachers. Additionally, he is a locomotor disabled person
having 70% permanent disability         and also a bronchial
asthmatic patent with congenital kyphoscoliosis with
reversibility - 91% and require frequent medical treatment.
3.  Shorn of unnecessary details, the substratum of the matter
presented before this court remain that in terms of the
guideline issued by the Govt., the petitioner made necessary
representation to the Director through DEO for his inter
district   transfer  from   present   place   of  posting    to
Kundaposhi       U.G.U.P   School,  Kuchinda     under   BEO,
Kuchinda, Sambalpur district which is nearby to his native
place and such representation was duly recommended by
the DEO, Jharsuguda to the Director vide letter no. 2550
dated 13.07.2020.
4. Thereafter the Director, Elementary Education sought
clarification from the Govt. vide letter dated 18.12.2020 and
in response to the letter of the Director the Govt. vide letter
date 01.02.2021 clearly directed the Director to examine the
case as per the guidelines and if applicable resubmit the
proposal with views after due certification of the disability
by the State Medical Board.
5. After getting the letter from the Govt. the Director requested
the Chief Medical and Public Health Officer to examine the
petitioner and issue Disable certificate afresh for his inter
district transfer. The Chief Medical and Public Health
Officer, Cuttack vide letter date 29.04.2021 intimated the
Director that the petitioner is 70% permanent disabled
person.
6. Thereafter, the petitioner approached this Court by filing a
writ application bearing W.P. (C) No.28177/2021 with a
prayer for his inter district transfer and this Court vide
order dated 23.09.2021 directed the Director of Elementary
Education, Orissa, to look into the matter and take decision,
taking into consideration the plea taken in the writ petition
and the recommendation therein within a period of 6 weeks.
Citing non-compliance, the petitioner filed a contempt
application bearing CONTC No. 7110/2021 on 29.11.2021,
which is under jurisdiction of the Hon'ble Court for
admission.
7. Subsequently, the Director rejected the claim of the
petitioner for inter district transfer vide office order dated
14.02.2022. While admitting the percentage of disability, the
Director rejected the claim of the petitioner for inter district
transfer by referring to 1997 Rules, as amended and read
with the Govt. Notification dated 04.10.2018 i.e. the
Guideline for Inter District transfer read with the
notification dated 17.05.2016 issued by the Health and
Family welfare Department without considering the other
resolution annexed in the earlier Writ Petition.
II.   Submissions of the petitioner
8. Learned     counsel   for  the   petitioner   submitted    that
admittedly there was recommendation by the DEO under
Annexure-3 series. He admitted that the Government
directed the Director under Annexure-5 to examine the
matter as per the guideline and resubmit the proposal with
his views after due certification of the disability by State
Medical Board for consideration. He further admitted that
the Medical Board granted fresh Disability Certificate and
the same was again recommended to Govt. vide letter dated
9. It is also admitted in the impugned order that the Govt.
notification dated 04.03.2018 is governing the field. So far as
inter-district transfer and Clause- L of the said guideline
which clearly spells out that "the transfer cases of persons
with disability shall be considered on the basis of
certification of the disability by the State Medical Board, but
the above facts has not been considered by the Director
while rejecting the claim nor seeking any clarification from
the Government in that regard. In fact, without application
of mind by invoking the clause meant for mutual transfer or
transfer on the ground of disease prescribed vide resolution
dated 17.09.2016 of Health and Family Welfare Department,
has rejected the claim.
10. Learned Counsel further submitted that Clause-6 (d) of the
notification dated 17.05.2016 issued by Health and Family
Welfare Department also permits for such transfer. It is
further submitted that the Clause 16 of the resolution of GA
Department dated 03.12.2013 also permits inter district
transfer which has not been considered. He submitted that
the Director also failed to take a note of the resolution dated
25.02.2021 of the Department of Social Security and
Empowerment of Persons with Disability where clause-17
underlined that the employees with disability should be
posted or transferred as far as possible nearer to his native
place.
11. Moreover, there is no bar under 1977 Rules for inter-district
transfer. Rather as per the Govt. notification dated
04.10.2018 inter district transfer is permissible and in view of
the provision of Right of Persons with Disability Act, 2016,
read with the Government Notification (supra) the
petitioner’s request which is for inter district transfer is
permissible and the rejection order passed by the Director is
not only     erroneous but also an instance of clear non
application of mind.
III. Submission on Behalf of the Opposite party-1
12.   Learned Counsel for the Opposite Parties submitted that as
per the provision of Odisha Elementary Education (Method
of Education (Method of Recruitment and Conditions of
Service of Teachers and Officers) Amendment Rules, 2014
and Odisha Elementary Education (Method of Recruitment
and Conditions of Service of Teachers and Officers)
Amendment Rules, 2019, the service of the petitioner falls
under District cadre and as per the said District cadre the
petitioner's service is confined to Jharsuguda district only
and there is no rule governing in the field for his transfer to
the district of his choice i.e. Sambalpur and the same is not
permissible other than his online application for transfer as
per the aforesaid principles as laid down in para-7 of the
present petition under Annexure-A/4.
13.   Moreover, the petitioner had never submitted online
application. It is needless to mention here that as per the
prevailing rule, the inter district transfer of the petitioner
from Kolbira Block of Jharsuguda district to Kuchinda Block
of Sambalpur district is eligible to be taken into
consideration only based on the procedures as laid down in
the Notification No.22167/SME dated 04.10.2018 issued by
the Department of School and Mass Education. However,
since the district cadre of the petitioner's service is confined
to Jharsuguda district, hence the said transfer cannot be
given effect to.
14.   It is humbly submitted that as per the guidelines for Inter-
district transfer and mutual transfer/ Intra-District transfer
Rationalisation    of  Headmasters       Asst.    Teachers   Asst.
Teachers     (Ex   cadre)    Jr.  Teachers/     Junior   Teachers
(Contractual)     and    Gana     Sikhyaks      of   Government
Elementary Schools in the State vide Notification No.
22167/S&ME dated 04.10.2018 at para-2 (c) prescribes that
Inter-District Transfer of elementary cadre teachers will only
be considered on mutual ground or ground of terminal
illness of self, subject to conditions laid down in this
guidelines. But in the instant case, the prayer made by the
petitioner for inter district transfer either on mutual ground
or ground of terminal illness of self. Thereby, the case of the
petitioner so far as inter district transfer is concerned cannot
be considered as per the New Transfer Policy of the
Government dated 04.10.2018. Besides para-2 (a) of the
notification dated 04.10.2018 which spells out that "the
transfer process shall be conducted only in online mode on a
computer-based Programme". But in the instant case the
petitioner never chose to made application through online,
as a result of which, his case could not come to the zone of
consideration before the transfer Committee constituted for
this purpose. However, pursuant to direction of this Court
the off-line application was also duly considered by the
authority and rejected rightly.
15.  The Supreme Court as well as High Courts through several
judgments have iterated that the differently abled persons
deserve sympathetic consideration and also need attention
of authorities while undertaking transfers. In order to
ensure that the transfers are taken up in a transparent and
rational manner with utmost priority to public interest and
appropriate consideration of human difficulties as far as
practicable, the respective state governments should
formulate appropriate guidelines in respect of the same.
Therefore, the first and foremost, it is necessary to look at
the state guidelines. The Govt. notification dated 04.03.2018
provides Guidelines for Inter-District Transfer & Mutual
transfer   / Intra-District transfer / Rationalisation of
Teachers/ Junior Teachers (Contractual) and Gana Sikhyaks
of Govt. Elementary Schools in the State. Clause- L of the
(l) The transfer cases of Persons with Disabilities (PwD)
shall be considered on the basis of certification of the
disabilities by the State Medical Board.
16.      Resolution dated 25.02.2021 of the Department of Social
Security and Empowerment of Persons with Disability deals
with the reservations for the Persons with Disabilities.
Clause 17 provides that:
17. Posting       or transfer      of employees       with
disabilities.- (1) The employees with disabilities should
preferably be posted or transferred near to their native
places or at least in their native Districts subject to
administrative constraints.
(2) The Government employees having children or
spouse with disabilities should be posted or transferred
to such places where facilities of health or education or
vocational training are available.
(3) Persons with Disabilities may be given posting
according to their choice, if possible.
17.      The Gujarat High Court in the case of Dipika Kantilal
Shukla vs State Of Gujarat1, held that the state has to act
within the guidelines framed by them, otherwise it will
remain nothing more than an empty formality on paper. It
was further held that:
“This court is conscious of the legal position that an
employer has the right to transfer its employees in the
interest of the administration and in public interest,
since transfer is an incidence of service. However, when
the employer itself has framed certain guidelines for
certain categories of employees, with a clear intention,
then the action of the concerned authorities should have
a reasonable nexus with the objectives sought to be
achieved. It is expected that the respondents will act
within the guidelines framed by them, otherwise it will
remain nothing more than an empty formality on paper.
The very objective of framing the policy will be defeated
in its implementation, which will result in arbitrariness
and discrimination, resulting in violation of Article 14
of the Constitution of India.”
18.     Similarly, Hon’ble Supreme Court in the case of State Of
U.P. And Ors. vs Gobardhan Lal2 iterated the importance of
adherence to the administrative guidelines.
“It is too late in the day for any Government Servant
to contend that once appointed or posted in a
particular place or position, he should continue in
such place or position as long as he desires. Transfer
of an employee is not only an incident inherent in the
terms of appointment but also implicit as an essential
condition of service in the absence of any specific
indication to the contra in the law governing or
conditions of service. Unless the order of transfer is
shown to be an outcome of a mala fide exercise of
power or violative of any statutory provision (an Act
or Rule) or passed by an authority not competent to
do so, an order of transfer cannot lightly be interfered
with as a matter of course or routine for any or every
type of grievance sought to be made. Even
administrative guidelines for regulating transfers or
containing transfer policies at best may afford an
opportunity to the officer or servant concerned to
approach their higher authorities for redress but
cannot have the consequence of depriving or denying
the competent authority to transfer a particular
officer/servant to any place in public interest and as is
found necessitated by exigencies of service as long as
the official status is not affected adversely and there is
no infraction of any career prospects such as
seniority, scale of pay and secured emoluments. This
Court has often reiterated that the order of transfer
made even in transgression of administrative
guidelines cannot also be interfered with, as they do
not confer any legally enforceable rights, unless, as
noticed supra, shown to be vitiated by mala fides or is
made in violation of any statutory provision.”
19.    Additionally, Madhya Pradesh High Court in the case of
Kamlesh Sharma vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh3 while
dealing with the case of transfer of persons with disabilities
held that the legislation is in furtherance of international
commitments and to give an equal treatment to persons
with disability.
“It has to be appreciated that once a person is certified
with permanent disability of more than 40% and is,
thus, covered under the provisions of the said Act, this
aspect is not germane. There is no doubt that the
appellant is only to be considered for transfer to a
proximate place to his native place, but the guidelines
of 1988 make it clear that such request is to be accepted
unless in case of administrative exigency otherwise.
In matters of transfer, this Court does not sit as a court
of appeal. However, where the very basis is erroneous,
this Court is entitled to intervene. Totally irrelevant
factors have been taken into account as stated above
and the provisions of statutory enactment like the said
Act, the said Rules and the Office Memorandum issued
in furtherance thereof are sought to be defeated. One
cannot lose sight of the fact that the legislation is in
furtherance of international commitments and to give
an equal treatment to persons with disability. All this
has been given a go- bye while rejecting the request of
the appellant and the Bank insists on implementing the
erroneous decision. In such a case, this Court cannot be
powerless to remedy the situation.”
20. Hence, it may be concluded that the bar under 1977 rules for
inter district transfer shall not be applicable on a person
with disability. Moreover, in view of provision of Right of
Persons with Disability Act, 2016, read with the Govt.
Notification (supra) permits inter district transfer of a
person with disability. Therefore, the rejection order vide
office order dated 14.02.2022 passed by the Director is
hereby quashed. The Director is hereby directed to complete
the transfer process within a period of THREE months.
21.    The Writ Petition is, accordingly, disposed of.
