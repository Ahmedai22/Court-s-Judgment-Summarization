Counsel for Applicant :- Ashish Kumar Singh,Pradeep Kumar
Counsel for Opposite Party :- G.A.
By means of this bail application, the applicant has
prayed to be enlarged on bail in Case Crime No. 556 of
2011 at Police Station Chaubepur District Varanasi
The applicant is in jail since 26.04.2011.
The bail application of the applicant was rejected by
learned Sessions Judge, Varanasi, on 19.04.2022.
Shri Ashish Kumar Singh, learned counsel for the
applicant contends that the applicant has been falsely
implicated in the instant case. The applicant is the
brother-in-law of the deceased. The applicant did not
torture the deceased not did he demand dowry. In fact
he never interfered the marital life of the deceased and
her husband. The applicant was nominated only out of
malafides. Prosecution evidence does not connect the
applicant with the offence. Learned counsel for the
applicant contends that the applicant does not have any
criminal history apart from the instant case.
Shri Ashish Kumar Singh, learned counsel for the
applicant further contends that the applicant is in jail
since 26.04.2011 i.e. more than 11 years. Inordinate
delay in concluding trial had lead to virtually an
indefinite imprisonment of the applicant without the
prosecution evidence connecting the applicant to the
offence. The right of the applicant to speedy trial has
been violated. The applicant has always cooperated
with the investigation proceedings and has joined the
trial as a law abiding citizen.
This is the first bail application which has been moved
by the applicant before this Court. The applicant
belongs to the bottom heap of humanity and
unfortunately forgotten class of citizens. He did not
have the resources to engage a counsel nor was he
given to access to legal aid for these long years.
Constitutional promise of securing justice has been
denied to him.
This appears to be a systemic failure. The Court will
observer no further. However, it is for all instruments of
governance, the trial courts, the police authorities, the
legal services authorities to introspect and bring about
necessary systemic corrections with the conviction that
such a state of affairs will not be repeated. Never again.
The District Legal Services Authorities in the State of
Uttar Pradesh shall draw up a list of prisoners who are
incarcerated for long period and examine whether they
have not been able to move bail applications due to
penury and lack of access to legal aid. Corrective
measures should accordingly be taken. Legal aid
workshop should be conducted in every jail in the State
of Uttar Pradesh to ensure that such grievances are
promptly redressed.
Learned AGA for the State could not satisfactorily
dispute the aforesaid submissions.
I see merit in the submissions of learned counsel for the
applicant and accordingly hold that the applicant is
entitled to be enlarged on bail.
In the light of the preceding discussion and without
making any observations on the merits of the case, the
bail application is allowed.
Let the applicant- Rajnish be released on bail in the
aforesaid case crime number, on furnishing a personal
bond and two sureties each in the like amount to the
satisfaction of the court below. The following
conditions be imposed in the interest of justice:-
(i) The applicant will not tamper with the evidence
during the trial.
(ii) The applicant will not influence any witness.
(iii) The applicant will appear before the trial court on
the date fixed, unless personal presence is exempted.
(iv) The applicant shall not directly or indirectly make
inducement, threat or promise to any person acquainted
with the facts of the case so as to dissuade him from
disclosing such facts to the Court to any police officer
or tamper with the evidence.
In case any averment made in the bail application or the
submissions during the course of argument are found to
be false or in case of breach of any of the above
condition,   the    State/prosecution   may     move  an
application for cancellation of bail application.
