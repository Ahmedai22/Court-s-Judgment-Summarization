.                     By this petition filed under Article 226 of the
3                     wp-158.21 Naziya
Constitution of India, the petitioner seeks a writ of
certiorari for quashing and setting aside the order dated
27th August 2019 passed by the respondent no.2 i.e.
District Caste Certificate Scrutiny Committee invalidating
the Caste Certificate. The petitioner also seeks order and
direction against the respondent no.2 to grant validity to
the Caste Certificates dated 4 th November 2016 issued by
the Competent Authority to the petitioner.
2.                    The petitioner also seeks a writ of certiorari for
quashing and setting aside the impugned Notification
dated           6th     January    2022   debarring/disqualifying        the
petitioner for 6 years from the date of the order for being
elected              or being    a Councilor of the respondent no.3.
Some of the relevant facts for the purpose of deciding this
petition are as under :-
3.                    The petitioner had made an application              for
grant of Caste Certificate to the Competent Authority i.e.
Sub-Divisional Officer, Bhiwandi.               It is the case of the
petitioner that the petitioner belongs to Muslim Julaha,
an Other Backward Class (OBC) at Serial No.57                      of the
Government Resolution dated 13th November 1967                             as
amended from time to time.
4.                    The Competent Authority        granted a Caste
Certificate in favour of the petitioner certifying that the
4                      wp-158.21 Naziya
petitioner was Muslim Julaha, an OBC at Serial No.57 of
the Government Resolution dated 13th November 1967.
5.                    The petitioner filed nomination paper for one
of posts of Corporator/Councilor for the General Election of
the respondent Corporation and more particularly                             in
respect of Ward No.78. The said post was declared to be
reserved for other Backward Class Women. Nomination
paper of the petitioner was declared valid by the Election
Officer of the respondent no.4. The election of the said
post for the period from 2017 to 2022 was held on 12 th
February 2017.                The petitioner    secured     the highest
votes, representing the National Congress Party and was
declared elected. The respondent no.5 had also contested
the election from the same ward representing a Political
Party,          Shiv      Sena   and  was    declared   defeated         and
unsuccessful. The petitioner was required to submit the
Validity Certificate of the Caste Certificate issued to the
petitioner. The petitioner therefore, made an application to
the respondent no.2 along with the documents for
validating the caste claim of the petitioner.
6.                    The respondent no.5 filed a complaint/objection
to the said application of the petitioner disputing the caste
claim of the petitioner and passed an order dated 21 st
August 2017                and   granted   Validity Certificate     to the
7.                    Being aggrieved by the said order dated 21 st
August 2017 passed by the respondent no.2 Committee
validating              the   caste   claim     of   the   petitioner,        the
respondent no.5 filed a Writ Petition bearing No.12122 of
2017 before this Court. This Court passed an order in the
said writ petition on 12th June 2019 remanding back the
matter to the respondent                      no.2 Committee and the
directed the respondent no.2 Committee                         to consider
various issues                formulated     by this Court     in the said
8.                    The petitioner thereafter appeared before the
respondent no.2 Committee and                       filed    their affidavit
dated            9th July 2019        along with the documents               and
genealogical tree in support of her caste claim.
9.                    The respondent no.2 Committee               thereafter
forwarded the said paper to the Vigilance Cell for enquiry
on the issues as directed by this Court as per the
provisions of the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled
Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989 (for short “the
said       Act”)          and    the  Maharashtra      Scheduled      Castes,
Nomadic Tribes, Other Backward Classes and Special
Backward                 Category     (Regulation     of   Issuance          and
Verification of) Caste Certificate Rules, 2012 (for short “the
6                      wp-158.21 Naziya
10.                   It is the case of the petitioner that the said
Vigilance Officer accordingly visited native village of the
petitioner and conducted home enquiry as well as school
enquiry. According to the petitioner, the Vigilance Officer
also proceeded to examine and recorded statement of
respected and responsible persons from the area including
the       representatives             of   local   self-government.       The
respondent no.2 Committee thereafter                      summoned the
Village Development Officer of Village Godey, District
Pratapgadh to produce the original Pariwar Register which
was produced before the respondent no.2 Committee.
11.                   The petitioner was served with a notice dated
31st July              2019    and also with a copy of the Vigilance
Report dated 22nd July                 2019 and 29th July 2019.           The
petitioner filed further affidavit               in support of her caste
claim in response to the said notice. The Vigilance Officer
recorded               the   statements     of various    persons         and
submitted a report before the respondent no.2 Committee.
12.                   It is the case of the petitioner that the respon-
dent no. 2 committee ought to have accepted the vigi-
lance officer’s report which confirmed after due verifica-
tion that the petitioner’s grandfather resided in Village
Godey, District Pratapgadh and is a Muslim Julaha and was
7                   wp-158.21 Naziya
carrying out occupation of weaving. It is submitted that
based on the vigilance report the respondent no. 2 com-
mittee ought to have concluded that the caste claim of the
petitioner was genuine and granted a validity certificate to
the petitioner.
13.                   The learned counsel submits that the respon-
dent no. 2 committee ought to have drawn an adverse in-
ference against the respondent no. 5 and held that the
document relied upon by respondent no. 5 was fabricated
document and had played a fraud on the respondent no. 2
14.                   The learned counsel relied on a registered
agreement dated 3rd November 2004 to show the speci-
men signature of her father was completely different from
Form AR6 relied upon by respondent no. 5. It was submit-
ted that the existence of stamp over the documents
evinced that the copies received by the research officer
were not copies of the original records of the Deputy Divi-
sional Officer. Consequently, a forged signature bearing
document was the basis of the conclusion derived by the
respondent no. 2 committee.
15.                   The learned counsel submitted that the copy of
the Pariwar register which showed the caste entry related
to grandfather as “Muslim” only produced by the respon-
dent no. 5 ought to have been rejected as the vigilance
officer had recorded statement of Village Development
officer who confirmed that the sr. no. 161 showed the
name of Mohd. Salim who was recorded as Muslim Julaha.
16.                   The learned counsel drew our attention to the
school records of the Primary School, village Godey and
contended that the said document proved that the peti-
tioner’s father had left the school on or about 31 st January
1962 and that he had migrated from village Godey.
17.                   The learned counsel requested the court to con-
sider the evidentiary value of the ration card issued in
favour of the petitioner’s father to substantiate that the
petitioner's father is a resident of Bhiwandi. It is submitted
that instead of considering the report of the vigilance offi-
cer that was made in compliance of the High Court direc-
tions, the Respondent No. 2 committee has erroneously
referred to and relied upon extraneous and extra ordinary
material placed by the Respondent No. 5 before it. The
learned counsel further submitted that the Respondent
No. 2 committee also failed to give credence to the school
leaving certificate issued by the Nalanda High School.
9                   wp-158.21 Naziya
18.                   It is submitted that the Respondent No. 2 com-
mittee ought not to have rejected the power loom permit
that was issued in favour of the father of the petitioner on
the ground that he would have been 15 years of age when
such permit was granted and to have considered that
there was no provision which prohibited the issue of a
power loom permit at the age of 15. It is submitted that
the Respondent No. 2 committee ought to have given fur-
ther opportunity to the petitioner before concluding the
hearing. It is submitted that the Respondent No. 2 com-
mittee completed the entire exercise in extra ordinary
haste and consequently was denied a reasonable opportu-
nity to prove her case.
19.                   The learned counsel of the petitioner further
submits that the petitioner was not given an opportunity
to deal with the voter information on the date when the
matter was closed for order and ought to have given the
petitioner an opportunity to give her response to the said
document. It is submitted that despite the fact of pen-
dency of the present writ petition, the Respondent No. 3
by its letter no. MGC/F/417 dated 21 September 2019 un-
seated the petitioner based on the order dated 27 August
20.                The learned counsel for the petitioner relied
upon the following judgements in support of this case.
a. Smt. Bismilla Mohammedsab Sayyed (Mujawar)
@ Bismilla Allabaksh Shikkalagar vs Divisional
through its Member Secretary & Ors;1
b. Jamadar Mehaboob Ghudubai versus State of
c. Ansar Abdul Rashid Manchekar through his fa-
ther and natural guardian Rashid Jikriya

g. Shri Shahjahur Aminullah Momin V/s State of
h. Mr. Akhtar Kadar Jamadar V/s State of Maha-
1 Writ Petition No. 10577 of 2013
21.                Per Contra, Mr. Mendadkar learned counsel for
the respondent No. 5 supports the order of the scrutiny
committee dated 27th August 2019. He submits that this is
the second round of litigation of the petitioner. The peti-
tioner’s case is based on fraud and should not be enter-
tained. It is submitted that the petitioner has produced
fake certificate to prove her claim and should be ousted
on that ground alone.
22.                Learned counsel submitted that the petitioner
has sought to misguide the officer as well as produced
fraudulent documents to substantiate her case. Although
the father was born in Uttar Pradesh’s Godey district she
produced the birth certificate of her father showing that
he was born in Bhiwandi, Thane Mumbai thereby deceiv-
ing the authority. The learned counsel submits that as per
Rule 3 of the Maharashtra Scheduled Castes, De-notified
Classes and Special Backward Category (Regulation of Is-
suance and Verification of) Caste Certificate Rules, 2012
(for short “MSCC Rules) the petitioner ought to have ap-
plied where her father or grandfather or great grandfather
resided i.e. in UP and not in Maharashtra. It is submitted
that the committee also had to consider as to whether the
name of the petitioner’s father was Abdul Hafiz or Mohd.
Hafiz. The learned counsel submitted that by merely filing
an affidavit, the Court cannot consider it conclusive evi-
dence. The learned counsel drew our attention to pages
364, 191 and 189 and submitted that the statement of
person Ubadulla Ameen cannot be accepted in as much
as, if he was 70 years old on 28 th July 2019 then on 7th
February 1962 he was just 13 years old and could not
have been running a power loom as sought to be sug-
gested by the certificate at page 189 and could not certify
that the Petitioner’s father (who would be 12 years old as
per the Aadhar card age shown) was working with him.
23.                The learned counsel submits that the in order to
avail of Rule 13 (d) of the MSCC Rules, the Petitioner has
not proved that she was born in Maharashtra. It is submit-
ted that as on 27th February 2022 the Petitioner’s father
was on the voters list in Uttar Pradesh. It is submitted that
the petitioner has failed to challenge the Vigilance Inquiry
Report dated 22nd July 2019 or the finding that her parents
are on the voters list of Pratapgad, Uttar Pradesh. The
learned counsel submitted that it was incumbent on the
petitioner to disclose all true and correct information, in-
cluding disclosure of adverse entries or material failing
which it was lawful for the Scrutiny Committee to draw ad-
verse inference.
24.                The learned counsel relied upon the following
judgements in support of his contentions:
a.       Aanandra Vithoba Adsul V/s State of
b.       S. P. Chengalvara Naidu V/s Jagannath &
c.       Prakash J. Koli V/s State of Maharashtra ;11
d.       Derry & Ors. Peek;12
e.       Bir Singh V/s Delhi Jal Board & Ors.;13
25.                In response/rejoinder Dr Warunjikar submitted
that the court had to consider whether natural justice was
done to the petitioner. He submitted that since the peti-
tioner was an ordinary resident Rule 13 (d) was required
to be followed and Rule 3 did not make any distinction and
cannot be given a restricted meaning and ought to be
used to find out the truth. It was submitted that the Peti-
tioner was obliged to prove every aspect beyond reason-
able doubt and not beyond all doubts.
26.                We have heard Dr Warunjikar on behalf of the
Petitioner and Mr. Mendadkar on behalf of the Respon-
dents at length, perused the papers with their able assis-
tance and have deliberated on their rival submissions.
27.                This Court by its order dated 12th June 2019 per-
mitted the petitioner to produce the family tree and ge-
nealogy which could establish the relationship with the
person whose name is in the family register; and that her
grandfather has a son by the name of her father; and that
her grandfather had resided in that village and carried on
the traditional occupation; and that her grandfather and
father shifted to the State of Maharashtra. The petitioner
was also permitted to prove her claim by relying upon not
only the document but the material relied upon to support
the entry therein. The petitioner was given an opportunity
to establish and prove her claim independent of the school
leaving certificate of her father. The respondent no. 2 was
required to investigate and submit a report.
28.                It is evinced from the record that, the pariwar
register and the statements recorded by the vigilance offi-
cer as produced before the respondent no. 2 committee
that the petitioner’s father and grandfather were from
Pratapgad in UP. Consequently, the petitioner ought to
have applied for issuance of caste certificate from the
place of ordinary residence i.e. the place of permanent
residence of her father or grandfather or great grandfa-
ther under sub rule (2) of Rule 3 of the MSCC Rules. On
this ground itself the petitioner was not entitled to the is-
suance of the caste certificate from the State of Maharash-
tra and consequently the benefits and concessions meant
for OBC candidates in the State of Maharashtra as held by
the Supreme Court in the case of Bir Singh (supra).
29.                Furthermore, the father of the petitioner was
fully aware that he was born in the State of Uttar Pradesh
on 15th August 1950 and was educated in primary school
at Gode during the year 1961-62; but despite that, he
made a false statement in his affidavit dated 30 th January
2017 before the JMFC Bhiwandi that he was born in Bhi-
wandi on 1st January 1945 and obtained an order from the
JMFC, Bhiwandi which directed Bhiwandi Nizampur City
Municipal Corporation to register the date of birth of Abdul
Hafiz Mohd. Salim Ansari based on a fabricated school
leaving certificate of Nalanda High School, Borivali (East),
Mumbai showing the date of birth as 1 st January 1945, ob-
tained a birth certificate on 26 th June 2017. This method
adopted by the petitioner’s father clearly evinces mens
rea. There is no other document evincing that the father of
the petitioner or her grandfather are ordinary resident of
State of Maharashtra. Consequently, in our view, the peti-
tioner would not be entitled to issuance of Caste Certifi-
cate as per sub rule (3) of Rule 3 of the MSCC Rules which
deal with case of migration within the State of Maharash-
tra. We are bound by the judgment of the Hon'ble
Supreme Court in the case of Bir Singh (supra) wherein
it held that a migrant from State of Uttar Pradesh was not
entitled to any benefits and concessions meant for OBC
candidates in the State of Maharashtra.
30.                In so far as the verification of form AR-6 that has
been issued by the Central Excise Department in favour of
the Petitioner’s father on 25th March 1965 is concerned,
The vigilance cell officer was informed that the records
were destroyed and even the genuineness of AR-6 could
not be verified. It was urged that even otherwise the AR-6
could not be considered as the father had claimed to have
been born on 1st January 1945 and had applied for license
in the year 1965 i.e. when he was 20 years of age. How-
ever, the documents now brought on record evince that
he was born in the year 1950 and consequently was a mi-
nor of 15 years when the Power loom license was granted.
We find merit in the submission of Mr. Mendadkar that no
license could be granted by any government authority to a
minor. Per contra, we are unable to agree with the submis-
sion of Mr. Warunjikar that there was no restriction to the
age in granting of a power loom license.
31.                The petitioner has not been able to produce any
document dated prior to 13 th October 1967 showing caste
of any of the blood relatives as ”Julah” in the State of Ma-
harashtra. The Pariwar Register from State of Uttar
Pradesh which shows the word “Julah” is in relation to
Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribes and not in relation
to OBC category and that to was prepared only after 1970
i.e. rewritten in 1992 on the ground that the record had
become obsolete as per the report of the vigilance cell.
Furthermore, there is no name of the petitioner in the Pari-
war Register. The respondent no. 2 is also not satisfied be-
yond reasonable doubt as to whether Abdul Hafiz is the
son of Mohd. Salim and has consequently held that the pe-
titioner has not proved her case. In our view too, the peti-
tioner has failed to prove and establish the genealogy tree
as per the order of this Court on 12th June 2019.
32.                After perusing the impugned Order of the re-
spondent no. 2 committee, it is abundantly clear that the
respondent no. 2 has accepted the report of the vigilance
cell. It is evident that they have considered every aspect
of the matter and given their due consideration to all the
documents produced, oral arguments and written submis-
sions of both the advocates. We find that the respondent
no.2 committee has considered the entire material on
record and recorded findings based on evidence placed
before it and after considering the same has rightly come
to the conclusion to invalidate the caste certificate issued
to the petitioner.             The findings rendered by the respon-
dent no.2 are not perverse.               It is well settled that this
Court is not to sit in appeal to re-appreciate the findings
as held by the Supreme Court in case of Kum. Madhuri
Patil vs Additional Commissioner Tribal Develop-
ment14. In our view in view of this mandate, we are not in-
clined to interfere with the findings of facts recorded by
the respondent no. 2 committee.
33.                The petitioner who is an applicant under the
MSCC Rules is admittedly born after the deemed date i.e.
13th October 1967 and ought to have applied from the
place of permanent residence of her father or grandfather
which would be Pratapgad in U.P. and not from Maharash-
tra. She being a migrant after the deemed date was not
entitled to contest elections in Maharashtra. The Supreme
Court in the case of Action Committee on Issue of Caste
Certificate to Schedule Tribes in the State of Maharashtra
and ors15 held as under:
“It will thus, be seen that so far as the Government
of India is concerned, since the date of issuance of the
communication dated 22nd March 1977, it has firmly held
the view that a Scheduled Caste/Scheduled Tribe person
who migrates from the State of his origin to another State
in search of employment or for educational purposes or
the like, cannot be treated as a person belonging to the
Scheduled Caste/Scheduled Tribe of the State to which he
migrates and hence he cannot claim benefit as such in the
34.                It would be appropriate to cite the case of
Aanandra Vithoba Adsul (supra) which observed that
“A wrong caste validity certificate granted in favour of the
party does not belong to that caste may deprive a gen-
uine and deserving person belonging to such reserve cat-
egory of the caste and all the benefits prescribed in the
Constitution of India.” The Petitioner has clearly tried and
almost succeeded in depriving another genuine candidate
to avail the benefits of the caste in the elections.
35.                We find no merit in the submission of Mr.
Warunjikar, that the respondent no.2 ought to have given
an opportunity to the petitioner for explaining the name of
her parents in the voters list in Pratapgad in UP. This Court
had granted sufficient opportunity to the petitioner to
prove her case and it is apparent that the petitioner has
failed to come to this Court with clean hands. We see no
reason to give any further latitude to the petitioner in
these circumstances.
36.                   We shall now deal with the judgments relied
upon by the Petitioner in support of her contentions.
37.                Apropos the judgment of this Court, in case of
Smt. Bismilla Mohammedsab Sayyed (supra), and
more particularly paragraph 5 relied upon by the peti-
tioner’s counsel, we are not in variance thereto. In our
view, the facts, in this case, are that the petitioner’s father
is from Pratapgad in U. P. and not a migrant within the
State of Maharashtra as was the case in the judgement re-
lied upon hence is distinguishable and does not support
the petitioner. Consequently, we cannot accept the
learned counsel’s submission that it was necessary for the
Vigilance cell to make an enquiry in terms of Rule 13 sub-
rule 1, clause (d) of the MSCC Rules.
38.                Apropos the decision of this Court, in the case of
Jamadar Mehaboob Ghudubai (supra), which relies on
the decision of Smt. Bismilla Mohammedsab Sayyed
(supra) in our view would not assist the petitioner’s case
as the Scrutiny Committee had discarded the Vigilance
Cell report on the ground that the same was not binding
on the Scrutiny Committee. In the present case, the Scru-
tiny Committee has considered the report of the Vigilance
Cell that is against the petitioner and which has not been
challenged by the petitioner.
39.                Apropos the decision of this Court, relied upon
by the petitioner in the case of Ansar Abdul Rashid
Manchekar (supra), the order of the Scrutiny Committee
was set aside since they had not referred to the material
produced by the petitioner. The present case is distin-
guishable since the petitioner has not challenged the re-
port of the vigilance cell which was considered along with
the material produced by the petitioner.
40.                Apropos the decision of this Court in the case of
Kumari Shaikh Shashim Mhamulal (supra) decided by
this Court, it was held that the Scrutiny committee is
bound to consider the vigilance cell’s report and that there
was no reason to disbelieve the same if it’s in favour of
the petitioner. This case too does not assist the petitioner
as in her case the Scrutiny Committee has considered the
vigilance cell report which is against the petitioner and not
challenged by her.
41.                Apropos the decision of this Court in the case of
Mrs. Firdos Ayyub Koti (supra) where this Court held
that the Scrutiny Committee had wrongly disagreed with
the report of the Vigilance Cell and there was no contra-
dictory material before the Scrutiny Committee to disre-
gard the material placed on record which is distinguish-
able in the present case in as much as the Scrutiny Com-
mittee has considered the report of the Vigilance Cell and
all the material before it. Hence this judgement would not
assist the petitioners.
42.                Apropos the decision of this Court in the case of
Shri Imram A. Ajij Shaikh V/s State of Maharashtra
& Ors. (supra) wherein it was held that once the report is
in favour of the candidate found to be genuine and true,
no further action needs to be taken except where the re-
port or the particulars given are procured or found to be
false or fraudulently obtained or serious doubts are raised.
In our view this judgment is distinguishable in as much as
the material produced before the Scrutiny Committee,
were fraudulent documents and raised serious doubts.
43.                Apropos the decision of this Court in the case of
Shri Shahjahur Aminullah Momin (Supra) wherein the
Scrutiny Committee report was set aside for want of rea-
sons to disagree with the Vigilance Cell report. This judge-
ment is distinguishable in as much as the material pro-
duced before the Scrutiny Committee, were fraudulent
documents and raised serious doubts and will not assist
the petitioner.
44.                Apropos the decision of this Court in the case of
Mr. Akhtar Kadar Jamadar (supra) wherein the Scrutiny
Committee report was set aside as it had not applied the
affinity test nor considered the vigilance cell report, is dis-
tinguishable from the present case where the Scrutiny
Committee has considered the report of the Vigilance Cell
and all the material before it. Hence this judgement would
not assist the petitioners.
45.                In our view, entertaining a petitioner who has
knowingly produced fabricated and fraudulent documents
to substantiate a false claim cannot be tolerated at any
stage. We have no hesitation to say that a person, who’s
