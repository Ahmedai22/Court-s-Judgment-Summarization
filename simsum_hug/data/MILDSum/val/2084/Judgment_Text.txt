1. Heard         learned   advocate          Mr.     Manish           Shah,
learned        advocate     Mr.       Harsh     Gajjar,               and
learned advocate Mr. Satyam Chhaya for the
respective petitioners and learned advocate
Mr.Hemang        Shah   with        learned       advocate            Mr.
Umang Vyas for the respondents and learned
Jayswal for the respondent-State.
2. By       these    petitions,         the   petitioners               have
challenged the order dated 08.09.2017 passed
by         respondent      no.2         disqualifying                 the
petitioners           from            consideration                   for
appointment         to     various         posts          such          as
Security        Inspector,        Traffic       Inspector             and
Store Keeper pursuant to the advertisement
issued       by  respondent         no.2   –    Gujarat           State
Road Transport Corporation published in the
year 2016 inviting applications for the said
posts.
pertains to rejection of candidature of the
petitioner for the post of Assistant Security
Inspector, Divisional Security Inspector and
No.17639/2017 pertains to rejection of the
candidature of the petitioner for the post of
Traffic       Inspector       whereas       Special            Civil
Application         No.17739/2017            pertains                 to
rejection of candidature of the petitioner
for the post of Store Keeper.
4. Since the issue involved in these petitions
pertains to rejection of candidature of the
petitioners          pursuant         to          the            same
advertisement issued by respondent no.2 and
on the same ground of violation of condition
nos. 19 and 20 of the advertisement, they
have       been  heard      together        and       would           be
disposed of by this common order.
5. The petitioners of Special Civil Application
No.16994/2017 and          Special Civil Application
No.17639/2017       are     having     qualification                  of
Bachelor of Education (B.Ed.) which was not
considered          as           minimum          educational
qualification           and         therefore,                 their
candidature was rejected. The candidature of
petitioner       of    Special       Civil        Application
No.16994/2017 is also rejected on the ground
of      wrong   calculation         of   percentage             as     per
CGPA method.          The candidature of petitioner
of Special Civil Application No.17739/2017 is
also       rejected     on       the      ground         that          the
petitioner        is   having         higher       qualification
than the minimum qualification required for
the post of appointment of Store Keeper.
6. Learned          advocates         for      the        petitioners
submitted that Degree of B.Ed. is equivalent
to      the   Graduate     Degree        and     it      cannot          be
termed       as    Post    Graduate         Degree.           It       was
therefore        submitted       that     rejection            of      the
candidature of the petitioners on that ground
is arbitrary.
7. Learned         advocate      for       the      petitioner                in
submitted        that    the        petitioner          is        having
higher        qualification            than        the         minimum
qualification         required          for      the        post          of
appointment of Store Keeper and therefore,
his candidature could not have been rejected
on the ground of having higher qualification.
8. Learned         advocate      for       the      petitioner                of
referred        to   and    relied        upon      the        various
dictionary meanings for the word “Graduate”
for its correct interpretation so as to mean
scholar        who    has     taken        a     degree            in       a
University and the word “Bachelor” so as to
mean person with a University first degree.
It was therefore, submitted that reason given
for the rejection by the respondent no.2 that
Bachelor        of    Education         (B.Ed.)         cannot            be
considered           as      Graduation              Degree               is
misconceived.         Learned         advocate       referred             to
the       following    dictionary          meanings          for       the
words “Graduate” and “Bachelor” :
wherein word “bachelor” is defined as under :
“bachelor - The usual title of the first
degree that is conferred on a university
graduate.”
wherein word “bachelor” is defined as under :
“bachelor – person              with      a     university
first degree”
3)       Oxford    Illustrated          Dictionary,            wherein
words “Bachelor” and “Graduate” are defined
“bachelor    –    University          degree           below
“graduate – One who holds an academic
degree; one who has graduated”
4)       Wharton’s   Law      Lexicon,        wherein           words
“Bachelor”       and    “Graduate”        are      defined             as
“bachelor – one who takes the degree of
apprentice or student of arts (B.A.),
preliminary to that of master (M.A.) at
the Universities.”
“graduates – scholars who have taken a
degree in a university”
Edition,        wherein        words      “Bachelor”                and
“Graduate” have been defined as under :
“Bachelor – In the universities there
are bachelors of arts, of law, in
divinity, in medicine & c. which is the
first degree taken by students before
they come to greater dignity.”
“Graduates -         To confer a degree or
diploma upon at the close of a course of
study, as in a University, College or
9. Reliance was also placed on the decision of
Hon’ble       Supreme    Court       in  case       of      Parvaiz
Ahmad Parry and State of Jammu and Kashmir
and       others   reported        in    (2015)       17      Supreme
Court        Cases   709     to       submit     that         minimum
qualification prescribed for applying to the
post is         Graduation and therefore, when the
petitioners are having Bachelor of Education
Degree, the petitioners ought to have been
considered as eligible candidates and in view
of dictionary meaning of words “Bachelor” and
“Graduate”, the petitioners should have been
considered          having          in     possession                 the
prescribed        qualification          to    apply        for       the
respective        posts    in      the    advertisement               and
there        is   no    breach         of    requirement                 of
educational qualification.
10.          On the other hand, learned advocate Mr.
Hemang         Shah    for        the      respondent               no.2
Corporation         submitted           that      Bachelor               of
Education (B.Ed.) is a Post Graduate course
offered for those interested in pursuing a
career in teaching. It was submitted that to
get        admission    in      B.Ed.       course,           minimum
qualification required is Bachelor of Arts or
Bachelor of Science.
11.          Learned    advocate          for   respondent              no.2
referred to and relied upon section 22 of the
University Grants Act, 1956 to submit that a
student who wants to pursue B.Ed. Course is
required to have degree of Graduate. It was
submitted that a student who wants to pursue
LL.B.       course    then     the     eligibility           for       the
same is graduation and similarly, B.Ed. is
also a Post Graduate course.
12.          Learned    advocate         also   relied         upon        the
clarification received from Hemchandracharya
North       Gujarat     University,          Patan        which           is
produced on record wherein it is clarified
that       for   admission         in    B.Ed.      course,            the
eligibility          of     a      student        is       to        have
qualification         of    graduation         in    any        of     the
branches         of    arts        or     science.           It        was
therefore, submitted that the petitioners who
are        either       B.Ed.          Or     having              higher
qualification than that of Graduate are not
eligible for consideration for the respective
posts.
13.          Learned advocate placed reliance on the
decision of Supreme Court in case of Chief
Manger, Punjab National Bank & Anr. v. Anit
Kumar Das (Judgment dated 03.11.2020 rendered
in      Civil   Appeal      No.3602/2020)            wherein           the
Supreme        Court    held        that    it      is      for        the
employer         to    determine           and       decide            the
relevancy           and         suitability               of           the
qualifications           for         any    post         and         when
qualifications are prescribed keeping in view
the need and interest of an institution or an
industry or an establishment, as the case may
be, the employer is required to assess the
expediency or advisability or utility of such
prescription          of      qualifications.                It        was
submitted that it is not for the Court to
consider          and        assess          the          education
qualification. It was submitted that as the
petitioners are having higher qualification
than       what  is   required          by  respondent             no.2-
Corporation,           the         candidature             of          the
petitioners have rightly been rejected for
the respective posts.
14.          Having considered the rival submissions
and       having   gone     through        the     materials              on
record, it appears that the petitioners of
Special Civil Application No.16694/2017 and
Special Civil Application No. 17639/2017 are
having qualification of Bachelor of Education
whereas         petitioner             of     Special              Civil
Application            No.17739/2017                is            having
qualification of B. Tech (Mechanical). All
the petitioners are therefore, having higher
qualification          than        what     is      required              as
minimum           qualification               as          per            the
advertisement issued by respondent no.2.
15.          Reliance      placed           on    behalf           of        the
petitioners on various dictionary meanings of
words          “Bachelor”           and       “Graduate”                 are
concerned,         the     same        are    required             to       be
considered in facts of the case. Respondent
no.2 has issued advertisement with minimum
qualification          of    graduation            which         can        be
translated         as    “Snatak”          in    Gujarati            which
means person having Degree of any University
considering the first degree in University.
It is also not in dispute that for pursuing
the        course    of    Bachelor          of     Education,                a
student has to possess the Bachelor degree of
graduation either in Arts or in Science then
only        the   B.Ed.      course         can       be       pursued.
Therefore,          Degree         of      B.Ed.         cannot            be
considered as Bachelor Degree of graduation
as such. In similar analogy for the purpose
of pursuing the course of law, a student has
to be a graduate so as to get admission in
LL.B course and only exception is to pursue
as a integrated             Five years course as being
taught        by   various       Law       Universities              which
gives        degree     of    graduation            and       LL.B.           A
student cannot get admission either in B.Ed.
Page 10 of 19
or      three    years   LL.B.          course     after         passing
12th       standard    examination            directly           without
having Bachelor Graduation Degree. Therefore,
the interpretation made by respondent no.2
Corporation for not considering B.Ed. as a
Bachelor          Graduate degree is in consonance
with aforesaid reasoning. Similarly, section
22       of    the    University           Grants         Act,         1952
provides          for    granting            Degree            by        the
respective Universities and as such, similar
nomenclature of the particular qualification
cannot        entitle    the      petitioners            for        having
minimum        qualification.            The   petitioners               are
having        more    qualifications              than        that          of
16.          The   Hon’ble     Supreme          Court      in      case         of
Anit        Kumar   Das    (supra)          held      that          person
having higher qualification was rightly not
considered for the post of peon in the bank
when minimum prescribed qualification was of
passing 12th standard or its equivalent with
basic reading/writing knowledge of English.
The Hon’ble Supreme Court held as under :
“7. Even otherwise, prescribing the
eligibility                      criteria/educational
qualification that a graduate shall not
be eligible to apply was a conscious
Page 11 of 19
decision taken by the Bank and the same
was as per the Circular letter No. 25 of
2008 dated 06.11.2008. In the case of J.
Rangaswamy (supra), it is observed and
held by this Court that it is not for
the court to consider the relevance of
qualifications prescribed for various
posts.
7.1 In the case of Yogesh Kumar (supra),
it is observed and held by this Court
that   recruitment          to    public           service
should be held strictly in accordance
with the terms of advertisement and the
recruitment rules, if any. Deviation
from    the    rules         allows         entry             to
ineligible persons and deprives many
others who could have competed for the
post.
7.2 In a recent decision of this Court
in the case of Zahoor Ahmad Rather
(supra), this Court has distinguished
another decision of this Court in the
case of Jyoti K.K. v. Kerala Public
taking the view that in a case where
lower qualification is prescribed, if a
person       has            acquired                  higher
qualifications, such qualification can
certainly be stated to presuppose the
acquisition of the lower qualifications
prescribed for the post. In the said
decision, this Court also took note of
another decision of this Court in the
case of State of Punjab v. Anita (2015)
2 SCC 170, in which case, this Court on
facts distinguished the decision in the
case   of   Jyoti         K.K.    (supra).             While
distinguishing the decision in the case
of Jyoti K.K. (supra), it is observed in
paras 25 and 26 as under:
“25. The decision in Jyoti K.K.
[Jyoti K.K. v. Kerala Public Service
(2013) 3 SCC (L&S) 664] has been
considered in a judgment of two
learned Judges in State of Punjab v.
Anita [State of Punjab v. Anita,
(L&S)      329].          In        that            case,
applications            were       invited              for
JBT/ETT qualified teachers. Under
the      rules,             the           prescribed
qualification for a JBT teacher
included a Matric with a two years'
course in JBT training and knowledge
of    Punjabi          and    Hindi           of        the
Matriculation            standard           or          its
equivalent. This Court held that
none of the respondents held the
prescribed qualification and an MA,
MSc or MCom could not be treated as
a “higher qualification”. Adverting
to the decision in Jyoti K.K. [Jyoti
K.K.    v.      Kerala        Public            Service
(2013) 3 SCC (L&S) 664] , this Court
noted that Rule 10(a)(ii) in that
case clearly stipulated that the
possession of a higher qualification
can presuppose the acquisition of a
lower qualification prescribed for
the post. In the absence of such a
stipulation, it was held that such a
hypothesis could not be deduced:
(Anita case [State of Punjab v.
SCC (L&S) 329] , SCC p. 177, para
“15.     It        was    sought            to        be
asserted on the basis                      of the
Page 13 of 19
aforesaid           observations,                that
since the private respondents
possess higher qualifications,
then       the        qualification                   of
JBT/ETT, they should be treated
as      having           fulfilled                 the
qualification stipulated for the
posts of JBT/ETT Teachers. It is
not possible for us to accept
the aforesaid submission of the
learned counsel for the private
respondents,               because                 the
statutory rules which were taken
into consideration by this Court
while recording the aforesaid
observations in Jyoti K.K. case
[Jyoti K.K. v. Kerala Public
664] , permitted the aforesaid
course. The statutory rule, in
the decision relied on by the
learned counsel for the private
respondents,              is          extracted
16. Rule           10(a)(ii)          reads           as
anything          contained          in        these
Rules or in the Special Rules,
the qualifications recognised by
executive orders or Standing
Orders           of      Government                   as
equivalent to a qualification
specified for a post in the
Special Rules [Ed.: The matter
between two asterisks has been
emphasised in original.] and
such          of         those                higher
the acquisition of the lower
qualification prescribed for the
post shall also be sufficient
for      the         post.’          (emphasis
supplied) A perusal of the Rule
clearly           reveals         that            the
possession                of                 higher
qualification would presuppose
the acquisition of the lower
qualification prescribed for the
posts. Insofar as the present
controversy is concerned, there
is      no         similar           statutory
provision            authorising                  the
appointment          of     persons             with
higher                  qualifications.”
26. We are in respectful agreement
with the interpretation which has
been placed on the judgment in Jyoti
K.K. [Jyoti K.K. v. Kerala Public
596 : (2013) 3 SCC (L&S) 664] in the
subsequent decision in Anita [State
of Punjab v. Anita, (2015) 2 SCC 170
decision in Jyoti K.K. [Jyoti K.K.
v. Kerala Public Service Commission,
(L&S) 664] turned on the provisions
of Rule 10(a)(ii). Absent such a
rule, it would not be permissible to
draw an inference that a higher
qualification                        necessarily
presupposes         the     acquisition                  of
another,               albeit                    lower,
qualification. The prescription of
qualifications for a post is a
matter of recruitment policy. The
State as the employer is entitled to
Page 15 of 19
prescribe the qualifications as a
condition of eligibility. It is no
part of the role or function of
judicial review to expand upon the
ambit       of           the            prescribed
qualifications.                         Similarly,
equivalence of a qualification is
not a matter which can be determined
in exercise of the power of judicial
review.      Whether           a        particular
qualification should or should not
be regarded as equivalent is a
matter    for        the   State,           as        the
recruiting authority, to determine.
The decision in Jyoti K.K. [Jyoti
K.K.   v.      Kerala       Public            Service
(2013) 3 SCC (L&S) 664] turned on a
specific statutory rule under which
the     holding           of        a            higher
qualification could presuppose the
acquisition            of           a             lower
qualification. The absence of such a
rule in the present case makes a
crucial difference to the ultimate
outcome. In this view of the matter,
the Division Bench [Imtiyaz Ahmad v.
135 of 2017, decided on 12102017
(J&K)]    of       the    High        Court           was
justified in reversing the judgment
[Zahoor Ahmad Rather v. State of
J&K, 2017 SCC OnLine J&K 936] of the
learned Single Judge and in coming
to    the       conclusion            that            the
appellants         did     not         meet           the
prescribed qualifications. We find
no error in the decision [Imtiyaz
Ahmad v. Zahoor Ahmad Rather, LPA
(SW) No. 135 of 2017, decided on 12-
Page 16 of 19
102017   (J&K)]        of      the         Division
That thereafter it is observed in para
27 as under:
“27.     While          prescribing                   the
qualifications for a post, the State,
as employer, may legitimately bear in
mind several features including the
nature of the job, the aptitudes
requisite for the efficient discharge
of duties, the functionality of a
qualification and the content of the
course of studies which leads up to
the acquisition of a qualification.
The State is entrusted with the
authority to assess the needs of its
public    services.          Exigencies                  of
administration, it is trite law, fall
within the domain of administrative
decision making. The State as a
public employer may well take into
account   social        perspectives                that
require    the         creation           of          job
opportunities across the societal
structure. All these are essentially
matters of policy. Judicial review
must tread warily. That is why the
decision in Jyoti K.K. [Jyoti K.K. v.
(L&S) 664] must be understood in the
context of a specific statutory rule
under which the holding of a higher
qualification which presupposes the
acquisition of a lower qualification
was considered to be sufficient for
the post. It was in the context of
Page 17 of 19
specific       rule         that       the         decision
in Jyoti K.K. [Jyoti K.K. v. Kerala
turned.”
7.3 Thus, as held by this Court in the
aforesaid decisions, it is for the employer to
determine    and     decide        the      relevancy            and
suitability of the qualifications for any post
and it is not for the Courts to consider and
assess. A greater latitude is permitted by the
Courts    for     the        employer        to       prescribe
qualifications for any post. There is a
rationale    behind         it.     Qualifications               are
prescribed keeping in view the need and
interest of an Institution or an Industry or an
establishment as the case may be. The Courts
are not fit instruments to assess expediency or
advisability or utility of such prescription of
qualifications. However, at the same time, the
employer cannot act arbitrarily or fancifully
in prescribing qualifications for posts. In the
present   case,     prescribing           the      eligibility
criteria/educational           qualification            that         a
graduate candidate shall not be eligible and
the candidate must have passed 12th standard is
justified and as observed hereinabove, it is a
conscious decision taken by the Bank which is
in force since 2008. Therefore, the High Court
has clearly erred in directing the appellant
Bank to allow the respondent original writ
petitioner to discharge his duties as a Peon,
though he as such was not eligible as per the
eligibility criteria/educational qualification
mentioned in the advertisement.”
17.          Therefore,    in    view       of   above      decision            of
Hon’ble Supreme Court in case of Anit Kumar Das
(supra), the petitioners have rightly not been
considered         for     the         respective           posts           by
respondent no.2 as the petitioners are having
higher qualification than the minimum prescribed
Page 18 of 19
qualification as per the advertisement and there
is no provision or rule which prescribes that
the higher qualifications which presuppose the
acquisition          of    the          lower       qualification
prescribed for the post shall also be sufficient
for the post.
18.          For  the   foregoing       reasons,       the      petitions
being      devoid   of  any     merit,      stands        dismissed.
Notice       is   discharged.        Interim       relief          stands
vacated.
At this juncture, learned advocate Mr. Manish
Shah in Special Civil Application No.16694/2017
and      learned        advocate    Mr.        Harsh     V.      Gajjar          in
Special          Civil    Application         No.17639/2017,                 pray
for continuation of the interim relief which was
granted by this Court while issuing notice to
keep one post vacant by the respondent authority.
In view of the reasons stated in the order,
the prayer is refused.
