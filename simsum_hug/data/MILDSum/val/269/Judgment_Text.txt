Looking to facts and circumstances of the case, issuance
of notice to respondent No.2 is dispensed with.
2.     This petition is filed by the petitioner-accused under
Section 482 of Cr.P.C. setting aside the order of dismissal of
the application under Section 311 of Cr.P.C filed by the learned
counsel for the petitioner for recalling of PW-1/victim in
Spl.Case.No.510/2017 vide order dated 18.04.2022 for the
offences punishable under Sections 4 and 8 of the Protection of
Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012 (for short ‘POCSO’
3.     Heard Sri.M.R.Nanjunda Gowda, learned counsel for
the petitioner and the Sri.R.D.Renukaradhya, learned High
Court Government Pleader for the respondent No.1-State.
Perused the materials on record.
4.     The case of the prosecution is that the petitioner-
accused is facing trial before the Special Court (POCSO Court)
CRL.P No. 3987 of 2022
for the offences punishable under Sections 4 and 8 of the
POCSO       Act.        The    P.W.1/victim      prosecutrix   the
cross-examination as P.W.1 and she said to be remained
absent for cross-examination and the Police have brought her
back for cross-examination. Learned counsel for the petitioner
is said to have sought some adjournment for cross-examination
which came to be rejected and cross-examination of P.W.1 was
taken as ‘nil.’   Thereafter, the application filed by the learned
counsel for the petitioner for recalling P.W.1 for the purpose of
cross-examination came to be rejected and the matter was
posted for final arguments, which is under challenge.
5.    Heard the arguments of learned counsel for the
petitioner   and   learned  HCGP    for  respondent    No.1-State.
Perused the order sheet. Especially, the order sheet and the
deposition of P.W.1 reveals that the evidence of the prosecutrix
examination-in-chief has been completed.        Subsequently, the
witness is not present and she has been traced by the Police
and brought before the Court for the purpose of cross-
examination.     At that time, learned counsel for the petitioner
sought some adjournment which came to be refused and
rejected by the trial Court, and the cross-examination of P.W.1
CRL.P No. 3987 of 2022
taken as ‘nil’. Thereafter, the application filed by the petitioner
came to be dismissed.
6.    Of course, as per Section 33 of the POCSO Act, the
prosecutrix/victim and shall not be called frequently for cross-
examination by the Court. However, that does not mean there
shall not be any opportunity given to the accused for the
purpose of prosecution cross-examination of the prosecution
7.    Of course, there was a defect on the part of the
learned counsel for the accused for not cross-examined the
prosecution witness and he sought time. However, the Court at
first instance, though rejected ought to have considered
sympathetically and allowed the applicant to cross-examine
8.    This Court in a catena of decisions held that fair
trial is a fundamental right which is guaranteed under Article 21
of the Constitution of India.      Of course, the trial is to be
concluded within one year under the POCSO Act.          The delay
should be curtailed but that does not mean the Court should
allow cross-examination without giving a fair opportunity to the
CRL.P No. 3987 of 2022
accused to       defend the case.   The trial Court ought to have
given      one     more   opportunity   to    the   petitioner for
cross-examination of the witness. Accordingly, the order of the
trial Court deserves to be set aside.
The petition is allowed.      The order of the trial Court
rejecting the application for recalling P.W.1 is hereby set aside.
The application is allowed with a cost of Rs.2,000/-.
It is needless to say that learned counsel for the
petitioner shall not seek any adjournment when P.W.1 is
present before the Court for cross-examination.
Accordingly, the petition is disposed of.
