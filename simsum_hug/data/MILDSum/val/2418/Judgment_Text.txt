The challenge in the present appeal is to an order passed by
the              National  Consumer    Disputes    Redressal   Commission   (in  short
‘NCDRC’) on 04.01.2010 whereby the appellant was saddled with the
liability to pay the amount of certain cheques signed by him along
with interest at the rate of 9% p.a.
The  appellant   has   raised    two-folds   arguments   before  this
Court,              firstly,  the   Investor   Forum    Aneja  Group  could  not  have
invoked the jurisdiction of the NCDRC in view of the fact that a
complainant in terms of Section 2(1)(b) of the Consumer Protection
Act, 1986 (in short ‘the Act’) means either a consumer or any
voluntary consumer association registered under the Companies Act,
1956 or under any other law for the time being in force. One or
more consumers, where there are numerous consumers having the same
interest, can also file a complaint but with the permission of the
District Forum invoked in terms of Section 12(1)(c) of the Act. The
relevant provision of the Act reads as under:-
“2. Definitions. - (1)      In   this  Act,   unless  the  context
(ii) any     voluntary      consumer     association
registered under the Companies Act, 1956
(1 of 1956) or under any other law for the
(iii) the Central Government        or    any   State
(iv) one or more consumers, where there are
numerous   consumers      having    the    same
(v)   in case of death of a consumer, his legal
heir or representative; who or which makes
12. Manner in which complaint shall be          made.—(1) A
complaint in relation to any goods sold        or delivered
or agreed to be sold or delivered or            any service
provided or agreed to be provided may be       filed with a
(c) one or more consumers, where there are
numerous consumers having the same interest,
with the permission of the District Forum, on
behalf of, or for the benefit of, all consumers
The  complainant   before   the   NCDRC  is   neither   a  voluntary
consumer association registered under the Companies Act, 1956 nor
under any other law for the time being in force. As per Mr. Palli,
learned Amicus, the complaint is maintainable on behalf of the
numerous consumers having the same interest in terms of clause (iv)
of Section 2(1)(b) of the Act. However, we are unable to agree with
such arguments raised by Mr. Palli, learned Amicus. A complaint on
behalf of one or two consumers having same interest can be filed
only with the permission of the forum of which the jurisdiction is
invoked.  Since   the   complainant    is   neither   a  voluntary  consumer
association   nor  a   registered    body,    nor   the  permission  of   the
appropriate forum has been sought, therefore, the complaint itself
was not maintainable.
Secondly, Mr. Abhay Kumar, learned counsel for the appellant
argued that it was clear from the complete set of original record
of NCDRC produced by Mr. Palli, learned Amicus with great efforts
and  at  his   own   cost,   that   M/S    Aneja   Consultancy   is  a   sole
proprietorship consultancy of Mr. I.J. Aneja. The same is evident
from the investment receipts issued to the investors.
Since the opposite party is a sole proprietorship consultancy
of  Mr.   I.J.   Aneja,    therefore,     the   liability    of  payment   of
investments   would   be   that  of   Mr.    I.J.   Aneja  and  not  of   the
employees who were engaged by Mr. Aneja at different places such as
Nehru Place, NOIDA and Ghaziabad.
Since,   the  complaint    itself    was   not   maintainable  and   the
appellant   is  an   employee    engaged     by   the   sole  proprietorship
consultancy, there cannot be any personal liability which can be
inflicted upon the appellant by virtue of only being an employee of
a sole proprietorship.
Consequently, the present appeal is allowed. The order passed
by the NCDRC is set aside and the complaint is dismissed.
Before parting, we must place on record the efforts put by Mr.
Chritarth Palli, learned Amicus in assisting this Court and also
making efforts to produce the photocopy of the record from NCDRC by
his own efforts. We compliment the efforts made by Mr. Palli in
assisting this Court.
The amount deposited by the appellant in terms of order of
this Court dated 26.03.2010 lying with the registry be refunded to
the appellant along with the accrued interest at the earliest.
Pending application(s), if any, also stand disposed of.
