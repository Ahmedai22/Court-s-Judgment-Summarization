5. From the side of the prosecution, P.W.1 Bablu,
P.W.2 prosecutrix, P.W.3 Dr. Jyotsana Kumari,
P.W.4 S.I. Ram Chandra Pal and P.W.5 Constable
Pradeep Kumar were examined. The written report

Ext.Ka-7 and G.D. entry as Ext.Ka-8. Statement of
the accused under section 313 CrPC was recorded
where the case of the accused is of denial.
6. The prosecutrix in her statement under section
164 CrPC has stated that she went with the accused
to Arya Nagar Karkhana. She was forcibly raped
there and was threatened. She was subjected to rape
thrice. She became unconscious and in the morning,
she came home and told the incident to her mother
and then her parents and brother Deepu went to
karkhana and caught the accused from there and
gave him to the police.
7. P.W.1 Bablu has stated that on 22.3.2010, the
accused enticed away the prosecutrix from his
home. He also went to karkhana. Both of them were
found there and he agreed them to marry. From the
karkhana, he apprehended the accused and the
prosecutrix, and handed them over, to the police.
In cross-examination, he changed the time of the
incident and stated that the incident took place in
the month of November, then stated that the
incident occurred on December 28 evening. He
further stated in his cross examination that his
daughter has not told him that she was enticed
away. He knew the accused. He is a resident of the
same mohalla. He caught the accused from
karkhana and stated that he will get them married.
It is further stated that he has shown the place of
incident to the investigating officer. He stated that
he got the written report written by Rajvansh of
mohalla. He told the investigating officer that his
daughter has agreed for the marriage. He did not
agree for the marriage. However, he stated that if
the daughter is ready, he can marry her. The
accused was caught from Karkhana by P.W.1 and
his wife. He also stated that his nephew Deepu was
also with him. He denied the suggestion that he did
not tell the investigating officer that his daughter
has given consent for marriage. He did not agree for
that, nor tried to get them married.
P.W.2 has stated that on 22.3.2010, the accused took
her to his karkhana at Arya Nagar by enticing her
away. He pressed her mouth from her clothes and
subjected her to rape thrice. She got unconsious.
Someone opened the door of the karkhana. Then,
she went to her parents and told them about the
incident. Thereafter, her parents and her brother
Deepu took the accused from karkhana to the police
station. She was also taken along with the accused.
In her cross-examination, she stated that she did not
remember the date and time of the incident. Then
she says that it was Monday. The accused used to
come to her house when P.W.1 was away and
talked her and her mother. She further stated that
the accused used to come to her house for the past
one year and they used to crack jokes in the house
and her family members did not mind accused
coming to her house. Then he says that she went
alone on foot from the house towards mandir in the
evening. Along with her, her younger sister Pinki
also went.
She further stated that she told the investigating
officer that she is 18 years old. She was enticed
away by the accused. She told her parents that she
is going to temple. They did not stop her. On the
pretext of taking her mandir, the accused took her,
his home and thereafter to karkhana. She stated that
she on her own accord went away with the accused
to temple. The accused has not forced her to go to
temple. However, when instead of taking her to
temple, he was taking her to karkhana, she
objected. On the way, she has not opposed while
she was taken by the accused. She had full faith on
the accused. Chowkidar was present at the
karkhana. He was under influence of liquor. Both
had taken liquor. In the karkhana, the prosecutrix
P.W.2, Chowkidar and the appellant were present.
No one else was there. The door of the karkhana
was locked from inside. She then stated that she
went in karkhana on her own accord. She denied
the suggestion that she has not given statement to
the investigating officer that from karkhana, his
parents and uncle apprehended her and Amar
Singh, present appellant. She further denied the
suggestion that she has told the investigating officer
that she has stayed with Amar Singh at his house
for the entire night. Her clothes were not seized by
the investigating officer.
P.W.3 Dr. Jyotsana Kumari has examined the
prosecutrix, P.W.2. No injury was found on the
person of the proseccutrix, including her private
According to pathological report, no spermatozoon
was seen. P.W.3 Dr. Jyotsana Kumari has stated that
no definite opinion regarding rape with P.W.2 can
be given and in the medical examination, redness
and swelling was found on the vagina. However, no
blood was found. There was no injury on any part
of the prosecutrix body. P.W.3 further stated that
she has not seized any cloth of the prosecutrix. As
per report of the Chief Medical Officer, the
prosecutrix was 19 years old.
P.W.4 S.I. Ram Chandra Pal, investigating officer in
his statement has said that on the pointing out of
P.W.2, he inspected the place of occurrence and has
prepared the site plan in his writing. He further
stated that P.W.1 has told him that the accused has
agreed for marriage. He further stated that P.W.1
told him that he went at the place of occurrnece
with his wife and brother Pappu. P.W.4 further
stated that P.W.1 has told him that the accused
enticed away his daughter and had taken to his
home. The investigating officer has stated that
P.W.1 has not told him that the accused took his
daughter to karkhana. P.W.4 further stated that the
prosecutrix told him that on the pretext of taking
her to temple and after visiting the temple, the
accused took her to his home and kept her entire
night at his house. She further stated that the
accused raped her at his house, however, she did
not tell him that how many times she was raped.
P.W.4 further stated that the prosecutrix has not told
him regarding any threat or marpeet done by the
accused. She had not told him regarding taking the
accused to karkhana. P.W.4 has further stated that
he has not inspected karkhana. He further stated
that the prosecutrix in her statement told him that
the accused enticed away the prosecutrix to his
home and he made her agreed for marriage.
The mother of the prosecutrix also told him that the
accused took the prosecutrix from his home to
karkhana in the morning. Mother of the prosecutrix
further told that when they reached to karkhana,
then the accused and the prosecutrix were found
standing there. During investigation, he has not
received the blood stained clothes of the
prosecutrix. He has not recovered the sample and
soil from the place where the prosecutrix was
allegedly raped. He has not taken any mark from
the place of occurrence. He further stated that the
place of occurrence is room of the accused
appellant. He has not shown the place where the
accused and the prosecutrix were apprehended, in
the site plan. He has denied the suggestion that he
has prepared a baseless site plan. He has further
denied the suggestion that he has not shown place
of occurrnece in the site plan. He has not shown
karkhana in the site plan. The suggestion that the
place which he has shown in the site plan is not the
place of occurrence has been denied by the witness
and further he denied the suggestion that on the
saying of the family members of the prosecutrix
and under pressure by senior police officers, he
completed the formality and filed false charge sheet
against the accused.
P.W.5 Constable Pradeep Kumar is a formal
witness, who has proved the first information
8. It is submitted on behalf of the appellant that the
room of the accused from the hut of P.W.1 is a few
paces away. The prosecutrix has not raised any
alarm while going to the room of the accused. He
submits that the prosecution has failed to prove its
case beyond reasonable doubt. The testimony of the
prosecutrix is not worthy of credence.
9. Learned Additional Government Advocate has
opposed the appeal and has submitted that the
testimony of the prosecutrix is intact. She has
levelled clear allegation against the appellant. The
same statement has been given by her in her
statement under section 164 CrPC. It is lastly
submitted that minor irregularity in the prosecution
case will not come in the aid of the accused. In
support of his contention, learned A.G.A. has relied
on judgment of Supreme Court in Vijay alias
Chinee versus State of Madhya Pradesh
2010(8)SCC 191 and State of Kerala versus
Kundumkara Govindan and another 1969
10. Having heard learned amicus curiae, appearing
for the appellant and learned A.G.A. as well as
perusal of the record, I find that as regards the date
of occurrence, in the written report, there is no
mention of the date of occurrence. In the chick
F.I.R. also, date of occurrence is not mentioned.
P.W.1 in his statement has stated that the date of
occurrnece is 22.3.2010, i.e. the date his daughter
was enticed away by the accused. In the cross-
examination, he has changed the time of occurrnece
and has stated that the incident is of November
month. Then he says that the incident is of
P.W.2 in her examination-in-chief has not stated the
exact date of incident; rather she has stated that it
was Monday. In her cross-examination, she has
stated that the incident occurred on 22.3.2010.
P.W. 4 S.I. Ram Chandra Pal has stated in his chief
that on 23.3.2010 when he was posted at police
Swaroop Nagar, the accused was given in his
custody which shows that according to testimony of
P.W.1, the date of occurrnece comes to 22 nd March.
As regards the place of occurrence, P.W.1 in his
statement has stated that the place of occurrnece is
karkhana where the appellant was an employee.
P.W.2 in her examination-in-chief has stated that
she was subjected to rape at karkhana. However, in
her cross-examination, she has changed it. She has
denied the suggestion that she stayed with the
accused at his home for the entire night. She further
stated in her cross that she told the investigating
officer that she was first taken to the house of the
accused, then to karkhana.
The investigating officer in his statement has stated
that it was P.W.1 who told him that the appellant
took his daughter to his house. P.W.4 has stated
that the prosecutrix has also told him that she was
kept for the entire night at the house of the
appellant. She further stated to P.W.4 that she was
raped at the house of the appellant. She has not told
P.W.4 regarding the incident at karkhana. The
mother and the younger sister of P.W.2 and P.W.2
herself – all have stated in their statement to P.W.4
that the accused took the prosecutrix to his home
because the appellant had got the consent of the
prosecutrix for marriage. P.W.4 further stated that
he inspected the place of occurrence at the pointing
out of the prosecutrix and prepared the site plan. He
pointed out the room where the incident took place
in the site plan, i.e. the room of the accused
appellant. He further stated that in the site plan, he
has not shown karkhana. The site plan prepared by
the investigating officer is Ext. Ka-5 wherein the
place of occurrnece is shown at the room of the
11. Collective reading of the statements of P.W.1,
P.W.2 and the statement of P.W.4 as also the site
plan does not show as to whether the place of
occurrence is karkhana or the house of the accused
appellant and thus, exact place of occurrence is
12.     Now. coming to the testimony of the
prosecutrix who in her statement has stated that on
the date of incident, she went alone from her house
to J.K. Mandir. Thereafter, she stated that on
22.3.2010 in the evening, she went to J.K. Mandir
with her younger sister Pinki. Thereafter, again she
says that she on her own accord and free will went
away with the appellant to Mandir and no force was
applied by the appellant to take her to temple.
While she was going with the accused to Mandir,
when she found that instead of taking her to
Mandir, the appellant was taking her to karkhana,
she objected and raised alarm.
Then she says that on the way, she has not made
any resistance while she was taken by the accused
as she had full faith on the accused. She further
says that she went to karkhana on her free accord.
She denied the suggestion that she has told the
investigating officer that she remained with the
appellant at his house for theentire night.
13. A perusal of the statement of the prosecutrix
shows that the same is self contradictory and
inconsistent and does not inspire confidence. At one
place, she says that she was enticed away by the
appellant and was subjected to rape at karkhana and
also was threatened by the accused appellant. Then,
in her cross-examination, she says that she went to
karkhana at her own accord. She was aware that the
accused was taking her on the opposite route which
does not go to temple. She did not make any
resistance as she had full faith on the appellant. She
has stated that the accused has never persuaded for
going out from the house. The appellant used to
come to her house for the last one year with the
consent of family members and they did not mind
that. P.W.2 further says that they never went to the
house of the accused. She further says that on the
pretext of taking to Mandir, the accused took her to
his home and then to karkhana. She denied the
sugestion that she has told the investigating officer
that she remained with the accused appellant for the
entire night at his home; rather she stated that she
told the investigating officer that she was in
karkhana with the accused appellant. She further
stated that she went alone from her house to J.K.
Mandir. Then she says that she was going along
with her younger sister. She further stated that no
first information report was written in front of her
at the police station. Thus, the testimony of the
prosecutrix varies from every stage and does not
inspire confidence, hence, to convict the appellant
on testimony of P.W.2, some corroboration is
required as held by Supreme Court in Mod. Ali
alias Guddu versus State of U.P. (2015)7 SCC
272 (Emphasis is on paras 29 and 30).
P.W.3 Dr. Jyotsana Kumari has stated that
according to report of the Chief Medical Officer,
the prosecutrix was 19 years old. She has not given
any clear opinion on rape. No external or internal
injury has been found on the person of the
prosecutrix. No spermatozoon has been found in
the pathological report. There was no bleeding.
Redness or swelling on the private part/vagina
could have come from some stimulant substance
like red pepper, petrol and therefore, has not given
any definite opinion about rape. P.W.4 has disputed
the place of occurrence as told by P.W.1. Statement
of P.W.2 regarding place of occurrence is also
doubtful. P.W.4 has stated that he has not collected
any soil or mark from the place of occurrnece. He
has not visited even karkhana which according to
the prosecutrix is the place of occurrence. He has
stated that he has not shown karkhana in the site
14. On overall consideration of the prosecution
evidence, statement of the prosecution witnesses
and the material collected by the investigating
officer, it is clear that in the written report and the
first information report, no date of incident has
been mentioned. Scribe of the first information
report Rajvansh has not been produced. The
prosecutrix in her statement has stated that she went
to temple along with the appellant at her free will
and accord, however, she told the investigating
officer that Amar had taken her to his home and she
was kept there whole night. This shows
contradictory statement of the prosecutrix.
Whether the place of occurrence is karkhana or the
house of accused becomes doubtful as per the site
plan itself. In the site plan, karkhana has not been
shown. P.W.4 has not visited the place of
occurrence, i.e. karkhana. Neither the soil nor the
clothes of the prosecutrix has been collected by the
investigating officer. Chowkidar of karkhana has
not been produced by the prosecution. The younger
sister of the prosecutrix who could have been the
eye-witness has also not been produced by the
prosecution; rather has been withheld. Hence for
not examining Chowkidar and Pinki, younger sister
of P.W.2, adverse inference is to be taken against
the prosecution as held by Supreme Court in 2001
Criminal Law Journal 2602 Takhaji Hiraji versus
Thakore Kubersing Chamansing and others.
Relevant paragraph 19 is reproduced as under :
"19. So is the case with the criticism levelled by the High Court on the prosecution case
finding fault therewith for non-examination of independent witnesses. It is true that if a
material witness, which would unfold the genesis of the incident or an essential part of
the prosecution case, not convincingly brought to fore otherwise, or where there is gap
or infirmity in the prosecution case which could have been supplied or made good by
examining a witness which though available is not examined, the prosecution case can
be termed as suffering from a deficiency and withholding of such a material witness
would oblige the Court to draw an adverse inference against the prosecution by
holding that if the witness would have been examined it would not have supported the
prosecution case. On the other hand if already overwhelming evidence is available and
examination of other witnesses would only be a repetition or duplication of the
evidence already adduced, non-examination of such other witnesses may not be
material. In such a case the Court ought to scrutinise the worth of the evidence
adduced. The court of facts must ask itself - whether in the facts and circumstances of
the case, it was necessary to examine such other witness, and if so, whether such
witness was available to be examined and yet was being withheld from the court. If the
answer be positive then only a question of drawing an adverse inference may arise. If
the witnesses already examined are reliable and the testimony coning from their mouth
is unimpeachable the Court can safely act upon it uninfluenced by the factum of non-
examination of other witnesses. In the present case we find that there are at least 5
witnesses whose presence at the place of the incident and whose having seen the
incident cannot be doubted at all. It is not even suggested by the defence that they
were not present at the place of the incident and did not participate therein. The injuries
sustained by these witnesses are not just minor and certainly not self-inflicted. None of the
witnesses had a previous enmity with any of the accused persons and there is apparently no
reason why they would tell a lie. The genesis of the incident is brought out by these
witnesses. In fact, the presence of the prosecution party and the accused persons in the
chowk of the village is not disputed. How the vanity of Thakores was hurt leading into a
heated verbal exchange is also not in dispute. Then followed the assault. If the place of the
incident was the chowk then it was a sudden and not pre-meditated fight between the two
parties. If the accused persons had reached their houses and the members of the prosecution
party had followed them and opened the assault near the house of the accused persons then
it could probably be held to be a case of self-defence of the accused persons in which case
non-explanation of the injuries sustained by the accused persons would have assumed
significance. The learned Sessions Judge has on appreciation of oral and the circumstantial
evidence inferred that the place of the incident was the chowk and not a place near the
houses of the accused persons. Nothing more could have been revealed by other village
people or the party of tight rope dance performers. The evidence available on record shows
and that appears to be very natural, that as soon as the melee ensued all the village people
and tight-rope dance performers took to their heels. They could not have seen the entire
incident. The learned Sessions Judge has minutely scrutinised the statements of all the eye-
witnesses and found them consistent and reliable. The High Court made no effort at
scrutinising and analysing the ocular findings arrived at by the Sessions Court. With the
assistance of the learned counsel for the parties we have gone through the evidence adduced
and on our independent appreciation we find the eye-witnesses consistent and reliable in their
narration of the incident. In our opinion non-examination of other witnesses does not cast any
infirmity in the prosecution case. "
(Emphasised by me)
15. In Kundumkara Govindan’s case (supra), relied
on by learned Additional Government Advocate,
Assistant Sessions Judge acquitted the accused
giving benefit of doubt, holding that the evidence of
the prosecutrix in a rape case cannot be believed
unless it is corroborated in material particulars. It is
not the case here. Law in this regard is settled.
Statement of the prosecutrix alone is sufficient to
convict the accused if the same inspires confidence
and is of impeccable character and quality. In case
the statement is infirm, then some corroboration is
The facts of the present case are different from the
above case law. Hence, in the facts of the present
case, rule of prudence cannot be dispensed with as
in view of the self contradictory and shaky
testimony of the prosecutrix, corroborative material
is required which is absent in this case.
16. So far as the judgment in Vijay alias Chinee
versus State of M.P. (supra) is concerned, relied on
by learned A.G.A., place of incident was not
disputed and admittedly, the prosecutrix at the place
of incident was subjected to rape and therefore,
there are concurrent finding of facts by the two
courts. Here, in the present case, place of
occurrence is itself disputed by the investigating
officer and from the testimony of P.W.2. In that
regard also, it does not inspire confidence.
Therefore, this judgment also is not applicable in
the facts of the present case.
17. Since the place of occurrence in this case is not
clear, coupled with the fact that the testimony of
P.W.2 is quite shaky and does not inspire
confidence as also the fact that younger sister Pinki
of P.W.2 who was an eye-witness has not been
produced by the prosecution, Chowkidar of
karkhana at Arya Nagar has also not been made
accused along with the appellant and has not been
produced by the prosecution, scribe of the first
information report has also not been made witness
in this case, I am of the opinion that such kind of
testimony of P.W.2 does not inspire confidence.
18. Thus, in view of the aforesaid discussion, the
prosecution has failed to prove its case beyond
reasonable doubt. Every part of the testimony of the
prosecutrix is infirm, doubtful and contradictory
which does not pose confidence. There is no
corroborative evidence in support of the testimony
of the prosecutrix. The prosecution has not been
able to prove the place of occurrence, the time of
occurrence and manner of occurrence. The exact
place of occurrence has not been established and
there is variation in the evidence about place of
occurrence as per the evidence of the investigating
officer and the witnesses. The court below has not
taken note of this contradiction which was a
material contradiction and therefore there has been
a total wrong appreciation of evidence on record
which has resulted in miscarriage of justice. There
appears to be suppression of material facts relating
to occurrence because of the contradiction as
indicated. Unusual manner of shifting the place of
occurrence and the fact of the prosecutrix having a
company of the accused appellant at her free will
and accord while going to temple and then to
karkhana as also they having been acquainted with
each other leaves doubt on the veracity of the
incident. The investigating officer has not collected
any evidence from the place of occurrence. Two
important and available witnesses have been
withheld by the prosecution from the Court,
therefore, it is hard to convict the appellant on this
quality of evidence and it is a fit case to draw
adverse inference against the prosecution for
withholding two important witnesses from the
19. In view of what has been stated hereinabove,
the jail appeal is allowed and the judgment and
order of conviction and sentence dated 7.7.2011
passed by Additional Sessions Judge, Court No.5,
Kanpur Nagar in S.T. No.759 of 2010, is set aside.
20. As per report dated 12.6.2017, sent by
Superintendent, District Jail, Kanpur Nagar, the
appellant has already been released after serving
full sentence and giving benefit of remission
period.
21. Let a copy of this judgment be transmitted to
the learned trial Court. The lower court records be
also sent back to the lower court.
