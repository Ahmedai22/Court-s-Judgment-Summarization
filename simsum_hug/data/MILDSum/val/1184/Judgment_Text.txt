The appellant has filed the instant appeal assailing the judgment
and order of conviction passed by the Trial Court for committing offence
under Section 324 of the Indian Penal Code and consequence sentence
of imprisonment for a term of one year with fine of Rs.1,000/-, in
default, to suffer simple imprisonment for further 3 months.
The Officer-in-Charge, Gazole Police Station in the District of Malda
received a written complaint from one Mosiluddin Ahmed on 7 th August,
2016 alleging, inter alia, that on 6th August, 2016 at about 7:45 p.m., his
younger brother Serajuddin Ahmed was returning from mosque after
observing Namaz.        At that time the appellant along with Khatir
Mahammad, Nazir Hossain @ Bhaltu, Maijul Rahaman @ Nathua and
Mansur Rahaman wrongly restrained him in front of the house of one
Jainul @ Buku and assaulted him on his head with iron rod and Hasua
with the intention to kill him. As a result of assault, the brother of the
de-facto complainant was seriously injured.      Hearing hue and cry the
villagers rushed to the place of occurrence.     The de-facto complainant
with his two sons also reached the spot and found Serajuddin lying on
the ground in injured condition.      He was immediately taken to Gazole
Primary Health Centre.       The Medical Officer referred him to Malda
Medical College & Hospital considering serious nature of assault in the
person of Serajuddin.      He was admitted to Malda Medical College &
Hospital and subsequently to a Nursing Home. It is also stated that the
accused persons are habitual offenders. They also assaulted some other
people of the village and they were facing trial in G.R. Case
No.1069/1991.      On the basis of the said complaint, police registered
Gazole Police Station Case No.462/2016 dated 7 th August, 2016 and took
up the case for investigation.    On completion of investigation, police
submitted charge-sheet against the accused persons.        The Trial Court
framed charge against five accused persons including the appellant
under Sections 341/325/307/34 of the Indian Penal Code.             As the
accused persons pleaded not guilty when the charge was read over and
explained to them, trial of the case commenced. On conclusion of trial,
the appellant was convicted and sentenced in the manner disclosed
above while other accused persons were acquitted from the charge.
When the instant appeal came up for hearing, the appellant did not
take any step. Therefore, Mr. Dipanjan Dutt, Advocate was requested by
this Court to act as Amicus Curiae on behalf of the appellant in the
instant appeal.    Mr. Dutt, readily accepted the proposal and he has
submitted the case of the appellant with all diligence and sincerity.
It is submitted by the learned Amicus Curiae that in a criminal trial
the prosecution is duty bound to prove at the foremost the date, time
and place of occurrence and the manner of the incident constituting the
offence before the Trial Court. If there is any deviation in proving the
aforesaid facts, the entire prosecution case becomes suspect.           He
substantiate his argument referring to the written complaint (Exhibit.1).
The written complaint was lodged on 7 th August, 2016 with the Officer-
in-Charge, Gazole Police Station.      In the written complaint it was
specifically stated that the incident took place yesterday at about 7:45
p.m. on the road of their village in front of the house of one Jainul @
Buku while his brother Serajuddin was returning from mosque after
offering Namaz to his house.
Mr. Dutt next tekes me to formal FIR. In Column No.3 of the
formal FIR, the police officer recorded the date of occurrence as on 6 th
July, 2016. He also refers to the evidence of the de-facto complainant
namely Mosiluddin Ahmed who stated on oath in his evidence that the
incident took place on 6th July, 2016 at about 7:45 p.m.. Therefore, if
the oral evidence of the de-facto complainant and the recording of
formal FIR are taken into consideration, there is no other alternative but
to hold that the FIR was lodged just after one month of the alleged
incident. There is no explanation whatsoever regarding delay in lodging
the FIR. The learned Trial Judge did not even consider the matter in the
impugned judgment.        Therefore, there is every reason to hold that
concocted story came up before the Court as a result of delayed FIR.
Coupled with the delay, according to the Mr. Dutt, admittedly
the relation between the de-facto complainant and his brother in one
side and the appellant and other acquitted accused persons on the
other hand was inimical in view of the fact that admittedly a counter
case is pending over the self same incident filed on behalf of the
accused persons. In other words, in the alleged incident, admittedly
some of the accused persons suffered injury and over the said
incident a criminal case was filed against the de-facto complainant,
his brother and others by the accused persons. In view of existence of
such counter case, false implication of the appellant cannot be ruled
It is further submitted by learned Amicus Curiae that except the
injured, no eye-witness of the occurrence was examined by the
and P.W.6, Jainul Sarkar did not see the incident of assault allegedly
inflicted by the appellant on the brother of the de-facto complainant.
Therefore, the evidence of the said three witnesses are in the nature
of hearsay. The de-facto complainant also did not see the incident
because it is found from his evidence that on 6 th July, 2016 at about
7:45 p.m. his brother Serajuddin left the mosque before his
departure. He reached the place of occurrence hearing hue and cry
and saw his brother in wounded condition. Therefore, Serajuddin
sustained injury before arrival of the de-facto complainant.
With regard to delay in lodging FIR, Mr. Dutt also refers to the
cross-examination of P.W.2 where he clearly admitted that he lodged
complaint after one moth of the incident.
He next refers to the evidence of P.W.4, Serajuddin Ahmed who
is the injured person in the incident. In order to cover up the lacuna
with regard to the date of occurrence, P.W.4 deposed that the
incident took place on 6th August, 2016. He also stated that he was
assaulted by the acquitted accused persons with the help of iron rod
and by the appellant with Hasua. As a result of receiving Hasua blow
on his head, he sustained a deep cut injury and the said wound was
stitched up with 23 stitches.
Learned Amicus Curiae then takes me to the injury report of
P.W.4 (Exhibit 2) which was issued by Dr. Shyam Sundar Halder,
P.W.3. On perusal of the said injury report it is found that Medical
Officer examined the injury on 6th August, 2016 at about 8:33 P.M. at
Gazol Rural Health Centre and found a cut injury approximately 4 cm.
in length on the head of the patient. In the injury report the medical
officer opined that such injury may be caused by lathi. Though in the
injury report the medical officer did not state as to whether the injury
sustained by P.W.4 was incised or lacerated wound, the medical
officer in consultation with the injury report opined during his
evidence that the said cut injury was lacerated injury.
It is submitted by Mr. Dutt that if there is laceration, the injury
cannot be held to be caused by Hasua because if a person is assaulted
with the help of Hasua there shall be incised wound. Therefore, the
appellant was wrongly connected with the injury sustained by P.W.4
because the prosecution case is that the appellant caused injury on
the head of P.W.4 with the help of Hasua.
For the reason stated above, learned Amicus Curiae submits
that the appellant was wrongly convicted. The evidence on record is
not sufficient against the appellant and he is entitled to be acquitted
of the charge.
Mr. Ranabir Roy Chowdhury, on the other hand, submits that if
there is any discrepancy between ocular and medical evidence, ocular
of the witness shall prevail. P.W.4 stated on oath in unequivocal term
that the appellant gave a blow of Hasua on his head, as a result of
which he sustained a deep cut injury. The other accused persons
assaulted him with iron rod. It is not in dispute that P.W.4 sustained
injury of the date and time of occurrence. Therefore, it matters little if
the medical officer fail to state the nature of injury received by P.W.4.
Mr. Roy Chowdhury further submits that the learned Trial Judge
considered the evidence of the witnesses in delayed way and
dispassionate manner. If the injured personâ€™s evidence is believed,
the appellant cannot escape from his conviction.
Having heard the learned counsel for the parties and on careful
perusal of the evidence on record, the question that arises before this
Court for consideration is the date of occurrence when the incident
took place. In the FIR dated 7 th August, 2016 the de-facto
complainant stated that the incident took place yesterday, meaning
thereby the incident took place on 6 th August, 2016. The formal FIR
was filled up stating the date of occurrence as on 6 th July, 2016. The
de-facto complainant stated that he lodged the complaint after one
moth of the occurrence. Therefore, the recording of the date of
occurrence in the formal FIR tallies with the evidence of P.W.2. If on
the other hand, the evidence of P.W.4 is taken into consideration, it
would be found that the incident allegedly took place on 6 th August,
2016. Again on perusal of the injury report it is ascertained that the
incident took place on 6th August, 2016 and the injured was examined
medically on 6th August, 2016 at 8:33 p.m. at Gazol Rural Health
Center. Therefore, if the Court accepts the evidence of the de-facto
complainant, then there would be no other alternative but to hold that
P.W.4    received  injury  on  6th  August,  2016   but    the  de-facto
complainant himself stated on oath that he lodged         complaint one
month after the incident meaning thereby the incident took place on
6th July, 2016 on which date P.W.4 did not receive any injury. The
appellant cannot be implicated for any incident that took place on 6 th
August, 2016. Therefore, prosecution failed to prove the date of
occurrence when the incident took place.
It is true that in case of discrepancy between ocular and medical
evidence, ocular testimony shall prevail because the medical evidence
is in the nature of an expertâ€™s opinion. The Court cannot deny that
P.W.4 received cut injury on his head but in order to ascertain the
nature of injury, the evidence of expert can only be relied on. When
the medical officer stated that P.W.4 sustained lacerated injury, the
said injury cannot be treated as incised wound on the basis of ocular
testimony of P.W.4. If the P.W.4 is assaulted with the help of a Hasua
on his head, there would have been an incised wound. Unfortunately
enough, no incised wound was found on the head of P.W.4. When the
allegation of the prosecution is that the appellant assaulted P.W.4
with Hasua, in the absence incised cut injury, the appellant cannot be
connected with the injury sustained by P.W.4.
Therefore, in my considered view, the appellant is entitled to
benefit of doubt and the learned Trial Judge ought to have recorded
an order of acquittal in favour of the appellant.
In view of the above discussion, this Court is of the view that
the impugned judgment and order of conviction and sentence is liable
to be set aside.
Accordingly, the instant appeal is allowed. The judgment and
order of conviction and sentence passed by the learned Additional
Sessions Judge, Fast Track 2nd Court at Malda on 31st July, 2018 and
1st August, 2018 respectively in Sessions Trial No. 2(9) of 2017 arising
out of Sessions Case No. 348 of 2017 is set aside.
The appellant is acquitted from the charge and discharge from
his bail bond.
Let a copy of this Judgment along with lower court record be
send down to the Court below.
Urgent photostat certified copies of this order may be delivered
to the learned Counsel for the parties, if applied for, upon compliance
of all formalities.
