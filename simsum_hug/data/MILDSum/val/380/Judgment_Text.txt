Counsel for Petitioner :- Siddharth Khare,Sr. Advocate(Ashok
Counsel for Respondent :- C.S.C.,Abhinav Gaur
Heard Sri Ashok Khare, learned Senior Counsel assisted by Sri
Siddharth Khare, learned counsel for the petitioner and Sri
Manish Goel, learned Additional Advocate General assisted by
Sri A.K. Goel, learned Standing Counsel for respondents no.1
Sri Anoop Trivedi, learned Senior Counsel assisted by Sri
Sarvesh Dubey, Advocate appears for respondent no.2 submits
that counsel for respondent no.2 Sri Sarvesh Dubey is a
panelled counsel.
Since the notices on behalf of respondents no.1 and 2 have been
received by office of Chief Standing Counsel, therefore, this
Court is not inclined to call upon Sri Anoop Trivedi, learned
Senior Counsel to appear on behalf of respondent no.2.
At the very outset it is noted that Director General, Basic
Education U.P., Lucknow is a department under State of U.P.
and office of Chief Standing Counsel has received notice on
behalf of respondents no.1 and 2, therefore, in such
circumstances, it is very strange that how Director General,
Basic Education, U.P., Lucknow/respondent no.2 has formed a
separate panel when the department is being represented by
In such circumstances, the Court feels it proper to summon
no.2 to explain as to under which provision of law he has
formed separate panel from office of Chief Standing Counsel.
In this regard, he may file personal affidavit and explain the
purpose of forming a separate panel from panel of Standing
Counsel formed by State Government.
The petitioner by means of present writ petition has assailed the
order dated 05.03.2021 passed by Additional Chief Secretary,
U.P. Government suspending the petitioner.
It is contended   by learned counsel for the petitioner that two
complaints have been submitted against the petitioner by
unknown persons without any affidavit in support of those
complaints. He submits that under Government Order dated
19.04.2012, it is mandatory that complaint should be supported
by an affidavit of person who has made complaint. He further
submits that a show cause notice was issued to the petitioner on
23.01.2020 and a detailed reply to the said show cause notice
was submitted by the petitioner, copy of which is enclosed as
Annexure-5 to the writ petition. He submits that frivolous
charges have been levelled against him which are based upon a
finding and roving enquiry by the authorities so as to make out
a case for suspension against him. He submits that the petitioner
has lastly been posted as Secretary, Board of Basic Education
till September, 2018 and since then he has never been posted as
Secretary, Board of Basic Education. All the charges levelled
against the petitioner pertains to period for which he was
working as Secretary, Board of Basic Education.
Thus, he submits that suspension order has been passed after
about three years from the date he has been shifted from the
post of Secretary, Board of Basic Education. He submits that
purpose of suspension is to facilitate the conduct of enquiry and
in the present case for about three years the petitioner has been
posted on different posts other than Secretary, Board of Basic
Education and thus, it cannot be said that the petitioner can in
any way tamper the evidence to be used against him. He
submits that the petitioner is at the verge of superannuation and
is going to retire on 31.08.2021.
Thus, the submission is that suspension order has been passed
mechanically without application of mind.
Per contra, Sri Manish Goel, learned Additional Advocate
General submits that the charges levelled against the petitioner
are so serious so as to award major punishment. He submits that
there is every apprehension that the petitioner can tamper the
evidence against him. Sri Goel has denied the argument of Sri
Khare that no affidavit was filed by complainant in support of
The fact that the petitioner will retire on 31.08.2021 is not
disputed by Sri Goel.
In view of the submissions of learned counsel for both the
parties, matter requires consideration.
Sri A.K. Goel, learned Standing Counsel is granted two weeks
time to file counter affidavit. One week time thereafter is
allowed to the petitioner for filing rejoinder affidavit.
Until further orders of this Court, operation of impugned order
dated 05.03.2021 (Annexure-7 to the writ petition) passed by
Additional Chief Secretary, U.P. Government shall remain
stayed. However, it is made clear that enquiry against the
petitioner shall continue and petitioner shall cooperate with the
enquiry. It is further provided that the respondents shall
endeavour to conclude enquiry expeditiously preferably within
a period of two months.
Put up on 03.08.2021 as unlisted.
