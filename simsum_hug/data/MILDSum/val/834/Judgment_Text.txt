certain allegations are made with regard to the
physical and mental cruelty. This Court would choose
not to go into the same, the fact remains that this had
led to the wife separating from the husband and on
15.04.2021, she left her matrimonial home and started
residing with her parents at Ahmedabad with her son.
1.1           It      is alleged    that     on 03.11.2021               the
respondent No.4 approached at her parental home
and under the pretext of buying the crackers to the
corpus, he had taken him away. She was never
permitted to meet him and her repeated requests
have fallen on deaf-ears. She, therefore, approached
this Court with the following prayers:
(A)        YOUR LORDSHIPS be pleased to issue
appropriate writ of habeas corpus or any other
appropriate writ, order or directions against the
respondent nos.2 to 3 for producing the son of
the petitioner forthwith before this Hon’ble Court
and hand over the custody of petitioner to the
petitioner or be pleased to pass any other
appropriate order, in the interest of justice;
(B)       YOUR LORDSHIPS be pleased to direct the
respondent no.2 to 3 to produce the corpus viz.
Petitioner’s   son     before    this   Hon’ble           Court,
pending the admission, hearing and final disposal
of this petition, in the interest of justice;
(C)       YOUR LORDSHIPS be pleased to grant such
other and further relief(s), as are deemed fit, in
the interest of justice.”
2. The petitioner approached the Nikol Police Station
by way of a complaint giving all these details and
lastly ventilating her grievance of non-return of her
son. She has also urged that there was an abrupt
dealing with her request of returning her son.
3.    On 23.12.2021, this Court issued the notice,
making it returnable on 13.01.2022. On the returnable
date,the corpus remained present with the father
through the video conference from the office of the
learned advocate, Mr.Vasant Barot. Noticing the young
age of the child and also the young age of the couple,
we had requested the learned advocate on both the
sides to meet at the office of one of the advocates and
workout amicable settlement.
4.    On 31.01.2022, this Court had received the report
from the Full Time Secretary, DLSA, Ahmedabad Rural
that the process of mediation was on. However, on
17.02.2022, the Court recorded that the mediation
could not become successful.
5.    This Court also spoke to both the spouses and
also met the child in presence of the parents and
without their presence as well. We directed the mother
to meet the child on Saturday and Sunday till the
Court decides on the aspect of custody. She was also
permitted to stay with her husband and in-laws as
they were welcoming her as conveyed to this Court.
Eventually, the arrangement was made for the mother
to meet at Bayad Taluka Legal Services Authority and
lastly before this Court decides the custody of child it
was found appropriate to appoint learned advocate,
Mr.Ekant Ahuja as an amicus curiae.
5.1    He was requested also to meet the spouses and
also explore the possibility of amicable settlement, we
appreciate that within a short time he not only has
undertaken that task, but also has assisted the Court
where he prepared the details of the respective stands
of the parties and the legal provisions concerning the
6.    Learned advocate, Mr.Gajendra Baghel appearing
for the petitioner and the learned advocate, Mr.Vasant
Barot appearing for the private respondents have also
been heard at length.
7.    We could notice that the petitioner has studied
upto the 10th standard and the husband has done BBA.
He is an agriculturist with 12 wighas of land. He has
mother and sisters, both the sisters are married and
one of them is a teacher. The father of the petitioner is
carpenter and mother is housewife. She has other
siblings and she herself has some sundry work.
8.    According to the amicus curiae, the disputes between
the parties also are not such which cannot be mandated,
however, the wife is very clear that she does not want to
start the matrimonial life once again. Initial issue was of
the place as she wanted to move to Ahmedabad whereas
the husband is staying in a small town and she is made it
extremely clear that reunion is not feasible.
9.    There appears to be a clear dispute between the
spouses on account of their personal belief systems, their
mind sets and the past baggages which are not allowing
them to look forward to their future. In this circumstance,
the question arises of entertaining this petition under
Article 226 of the Constitution of India.
9.1 We would like to quote at this stage the findings and
observations in case of Yashita Sahu vs. State of
Rajasthan, reported in 2020 AIJEL-SC 65636.
“17. It is well settled law by a catena of judgments
that while deciding matters of custody of a child,
primary and paramount consideration is welfare of
the child. If welfare of the child so demands then
technical       objections    cannot    come   in     the         way.
However, while deciding the welfare of the child it is
not the view of one spouse alone which has to be
taken into consideration. The courts should decide the
issue of custody only on the basis of what is in the
best interest of the child.
18. The child is the victim in custody battles. In this
fight of egos and increasing acrimonious battles and
litigations between two spouses, our experience shows
that more often than not, the parents who otherwise
love their child, present a picture as if the other
spouse is a villain and he or she alone is entitled to
the custody of the child. The court must therefore be
very vary of what is said by each of the spouses.
19. A child, especially a child of tender years
requires the love, affection, company, protection of
both parents. This is not only the requirement of the
child but is his/her basic human right. Just because
the parents are at war with each other, does not
mean that the child should be denied the care,
affection, love or protection of any one of the two
parents. A child is not an inanimate object which can
be tossed from one parent to the other. Every
separation, every reunion may have a traumatic and
psychosomatic impact on the child. Therefore, it is to
be ensured that the court weighs each and every
circumstance very carefully before deciding how and
in what manner the custody of the child should be
shared between both the parents. Even if the custody
is given to one parent the other parent must have
sufficient visitation rights to ensure that the child
keeps in touch with the other parent and does not
lose social, physical and psychological contact with
any one of the two parents. It is only in extreme
circumstances that one parent should be denied
contact with the child. Reasons must be assigned if
one parent is to be denied any visitation rights or
contact with the child. Courts dealing with the
custody matters must while deciding issues of custody
clearly define the nature, manner and specifics of the
visitation rights.
20. The concept of visitation rights is not fully
developed       in India.    Most     courts    while       granting
custody to one spouse do not pass any orders
granting visitation rights to the other spouse. As
observed earlier, a child has a human right to have
the love and affection of both the parents and courts
must pass orders ensuring that the child is not totally
deprived of the love, affection and company of one of
her/his parents.”
10. We         have   also noticed        Section    6     of       Hindu
Minorities and Guardians Act, 1956 which speaks of
the custody to be ordinarily with the mother till the
child is below 05 years. For ready reference, Section 6
(a) of the Hindu Minorities and Guardians Act, 1956
“6(a). In the case of a boy or an unmarried girl-the
father, and after him, the mother:provided that the
custoy of a mior who has not completed the age of
five years shall ordinarily be with the mother.”
This provision since speaks of the custody of a minor
not having completed the age of five years to be
ordinarily with the mother. Here, the minor is of four
years whose physical custody should ordinarily remain
with her. As rightly pointed out by the learned amicus
curiae that the father and mother are both the natural
guardians and in case of Githa Hariharan (Ms) and
anther vs. Reserve Bank of India and another,
reported in 1999 2 SCC 228 while considering the
aspect of custody between the two natural guardians,
the Apex Court had preferred the mother by virtue of
the proviso to Section 6(a) of the Hindu Minorities and
Guardians Act, 1956 in case of a child below five
11. The paramount consideration over the period of
time which has emerged before the Court of law is of
welfare and the best interest of the child. In case of
Tejaswini Gaud and others vs.
Shekhar           Jagdish Prasad          Tweari   and          other,
reported in (2019) 7 SCC 42 the Apex Court has held
that owing to the facts and circumstances of each
case, the welfare of the child needs to be determined
and the Court is not expected to take a pedantic
“50. When the court is confronted with conflicting
demands made by the parents, each time it has
to justify the demands. The court has not only to
look at the issue on legalistic basis, in such
matters human angles are relevant for deciding
those issues. The court then does not give
emphasis 10 Gaurav Nagpal v. Sumedha Nagpal
(2009) 1 SCC 42 on what the parties say, it has to
exercise a jurisdiction which is aimed at the
welfare of the minor. As observed recently in
Mausami Moitra Ganguli case (2008) 7 SCC 673,
the court has to give due weightage to the childs
ordinary     contentment,        health,        education,
intellectual    development         and        favourable
surroundings    but     over    and   above         physical
comforts, the moral and ethical values have also
to be noted. They are equal if not more important
than the others.
51. The word welfare used in Section 13 of the
Act has to be construed literally and must be
taken in its widest sense. The moral and ethical
welfare of the child must also weigh with the
court as well as its physical well-being. Though
the provisions of the special statutes which
govern the rights of the parents or guardians
may be taken into consideration, there is nothing
which can stand in the way of the court
exercising its parens patriae jurisdiction arising in
such cases.”
12. Reference          is  made        of   Section      7      of        the
Guardianship Act where the Court has power to make
order as to guardianship and Section 17 are the
consideration to be weighed                 with the Court in
appointing the guardians. Reference is also made
made of Section 26 of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955
which authorizes the Court to pass interim orders in
any of the proceedings under the Act with respect to
custody,         maintenance     and       education       of        minor
12.1 This Court presently is not concerned with these
provisions. Suffice to note that, it is largely concerned
with interim custody and the paramount consideration
shall be the interest of the child even the Hindu
Minorities and Guardians Act, 1956, the personal laws
of the spouses will require the custody of the minor,
who has not completed the age of five years to be
ordinarily with the mother unless of course there is
something drastic which is pointed out which would
not be necessiating giving of the custody to the
12.2 Again, as held in various decisions by the Apex
Court including in case of Yashita Sahu (supra) this
arrangement which is made by this Court under Article
226 of the Constitution of the India shall be subject to
the proceedings that may be initiated by either side
for the custody of the child exercising their statutory
13. Accordingly, we allow this petition giving the
custody of child to the mother. Let the same be
handed-over peacefully to the mother in presence of the
learned amicus curiae, if need be so learned APP shall ensure
the presence of the Woman Constable so that there is no
unnecessary dispute in this relation. As the father would have
visitation right, as was happening in case of the mother he
would have the right accordingly, on 01 st and the 03rd Saturday
the child shall be taken to the office of Office of District Legal
Services Authority for visitation from 11:00a.m. to 03:00p.m on
Sunday and 02nd and 04th Saturday he will be permitted to visit
residence of the petitioner. He will be also permitted to take
the child out with him for having exclusive custody of his for
few hours, however, any breach on his part of returning of the
child will enter serious consequences till the competent court
changes this order.
14.     We appreciate the role played by learned advocate,
Mr.Ekant Ahuja as amicus curiae.
15.     After the judgement was pronounced, respondent-father
of the child tried to create unruly atmosphere in the Court
premise leading to unmanageable situation for Campus
Administration. His intimidating behaviour make us suspend
the visitation rights for six months from today. Let welfare
officer also visit on continuous basis.
