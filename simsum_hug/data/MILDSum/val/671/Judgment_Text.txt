The petitioner was appointed as Security Guard in the Central
Industrial Security Force (CISF) on 5.8.1972. While he was posted at
the CISF Unit, National Fertilizers Limited, Nangal, petitioner availed
earned leave for 11 days from 16.8.1983 to 8.9.1983, followed by
half-pay leave w.e.f 9.9.1983 to 19.9.1983. The petitioner failed to
report back for duty on 20.9.1983, after expiry of his leave period
and kept on overstaying his leave. This resulted in disciplinary
proceedings being initiated against the petitioner and the petitioner
being removed from service vide Exhibit R2(a) order dated 3.7.1984.
Thereafter, petitioner was issued with Exhibit P1 discharge certificate
dated 12.12.1984. According to the petitioner, he was not served
with either a copy of Exhibit R2(a) or any speaking order, disclosing
the reason for his discharge. Exhibits P2 to P6 evidences the efforts
taken by the petitioner and his wife for obtaining copy of the
proceedings by which he was discharged. Having failed in the
attempt,    petitioner    preferred     Exhibit    P7   representation dated
4.4.2019, requesting to sanction pension and other service benefits.
By Exhibit P9 dated 27.4.2019, the request was rejected on the
ground that a Government servant removed from service is not
entitled for pension, gratuity or other terminal benefits. Thereupon,
petitioner   submitted  Exhibit   P10  representation   on   6.7.2019,
requesting to grant him compassionate allowance under Rule 41 of
the CCS Pension Rules, read with Government of India instructions
on the subject. In the absence of any response to Exhibit P10,
petitioner preferred W.P(C).No.21751 of 2019 before this Court,
leading to Exhibit P11 judgment, directing the 1st respondent to
dispose of Exhibit P10 representation in accordance with law. The
petitioner was also given liberty to place any material, including
binding judgments, before the 1st respondent, while the issue is
considered. The respondent issued Exhibit P12 order in purported
compliance of Exhibit P11 judgment, rejecting the prayer for
compassionate allowance. Aggrieved, the writ petition is filed.
2. Heard Adv.Girija K.Gopal for the petitioner and Advocate
G.Maheswary for the Central Government.
3. Learned Counsel for the petitioner contended that Exhibit
P12 is liable to be set aside for the sole reason that the order was
passed without considering the decision of the Apex Court in
Mahinder Dutt Sharma v. Union of India and Others [(2014) 11
SCC 684]. Attention is drawn to the detailed discussion in Mahinder
Dutt Sharma (supra) and the distinct considerations laid down for
determining a claim under Rule 41. It is contended that Rule 41 is
intended to mitigate the misery of a deserving Government servant,
irrespective of whether such person was dismissed or removed from
service. Reliance is placed on the Government of India Decision
No.3-X-R dated 3.5.1934 to contend that, whether the Government
servant has submitted an application for compassionate allowance or
not, on receipt of the order of the competent authority removing that
person from service, the Head of Office is bound to consider whether
it is a fit case for recommending grant of compassionate allowance
and, if the finding is in the affirmative, to fill in the application for
pension and send it to the Accounts Officer concerned for report on
the title of pension. Reference is made to Exhibit R2(b) assessment
of financial status of the petitioner to submit that the respondents
have admitted the fact that the petitioner is not having any personal
income. It is contended that the petitioner's wife and sons being
employed is no reason for the respondents to assume that the
petitioner is not facing financial stringency.
4.   Learned   Central  Government      Counsel   submitted   that
compassionate allowance under Rule 41(1) cannot be claimed as a
matter of right. The discretion to decide which are the cases
deserving special consideration is vested with the authority and the
authority having exercised that discretion, this Court is not expected
to interfere by invoking the extraordinary jurisdiction. On enquiry it
was revealed that, the petitioner's wife and two sons are gainfully
employed and the overall financial condition of the family is stable. It
is contended that the decision in Mahinder Dutt Sharma (supra)
does not apply to the facts of the case. Moreover, the writ petition is
liable to be dismissed on the ground of delay since, the claim for
compassionate allowance is raised in 2019, after 35 years of
petitioner's dismissal.
5. I find the objection on the ground of delay to be
unsustainable in the light of Exhibit P11 judgment, wherein this Court
directed the petitioner's request for compassionate allowance to be
considered in accordance with law. Further, even in Exhibit P12 order
rejecting the request, delay is not taken as a reason.
6. Rule 41 of the CCS Pension Rules, 1972, based on which the
petitioner is staking claim for compassionate allowance, reads as
(1) A Government servant who is dismissed or
removed from service shall forfeit his pension and
Provided that the authority competent to dismiss or
remove him from service may, if the case is deserving of
special    consideration,  sanction   a    compassionate
allowance not exceeding two - thirds of pension or
gratuity or both which would have been admissible to him
if he had retired on compensation pension.
(2) A compassionate allowance sanctioned under
the proviso to sub-rule (1) shall not be less than the
amount of Rupees three hundred and seventy-five per
mensem.”
A close scrutiny of the provision shows that, even though a
Government servant dismissed or removed from service is not
entitled for pension and gratuity, the competent authority can, in
cases deserving special consideration, sanction compassionate
allowance. For granting the benefit, 'the case' of the Government
servant should be one deserving special consideration. The thrust is
on the words 'case deserving special consideration'. In Mahindar
Dutt Sharma (supra) the Apex Court opined that for deciding upon
the special circumstance, there has to be some mitigating factor
which makes the competent authority to hold that, even though the
person was dismissed or removed from service, he ought to be given
compassionate allowance. The court indicated the manner in which
the process of evaluation should be undertaken and the distinct
considerations that would disentitle a Government servant from
being granted compassionate allowance. Being apposite, relevant
portion of the judgment in Mahinder Dutt Sharma (supra) is
“14.In our considered view, the determination of a claim
based under Rule 41 of the Pension Rules, 1972 will necessarily
have to be sieved through an evaluation based on a series of
distinct considerations, some of which are illustratively being
(i) Was the act of the delinquent, which resulted in the
infliction of the punishment of dismissal or removal from
service, an act of moral turpitude? An act of moral turpitude
is an act which has an inherent quality of baseness, vileness
or depravity with respect to a concerned person's duty
towards another, or to the society in general. In criminal
law, the phrase is used generally to describe a conduct
which is contrary to community standards of justice,
honesty and good morals. Any debauched, degenerate or
evil behaviour would fall in this classification.
(ii) Was the act of the delinquent, which resulted in
the infliction of the punishment of dismissal or removal from
service, an act of dishonesty towards his employer? Such an
action of dishonesty would emerge from a behaviour which
is untrustworthy, deceitful       and insincere, resulting in
prejudice to the interest of the employer. This could emerge
from      an   unscrupulous,    untrustworthy     and   crooked
behaviour, which aims at cheating the employer. Such an
act may or may not be aimed at personal gains. It may be
aimed at benefiting a third party to the prejudice of the
employer.
(iii) Was the act of the delinquent, which resulted in
the infliction of the punishment of dismissal or removal from
service, an act designed for personal gains from the
employer? This would involve acts of corruption, fraud or
personal profiteering, through impermissible means by
misusing the responsibility bestowed in an employee by an
employer. And would include acts of double-dealing or
racketeering, or the like. Such an act may or may not be
aimed at causing loss to the employer. The benefit of the
delinquent could be at the peril and prejudice of a third
party.
(iv) Was the act of the delinquent, which resulted in
the infliction of the punishment of dismissal or removal from
service,     aimed  at   deliberately   harming  a  third-party
interest? Situations hereunder would emerge out of acts of
disservice causing damage, loss, prejudice or even anguish
to third parties, on account of misuse of the employee's
authority to control, regulate or administer activities of third
parties. Actions of dealing with similar issues differently, or
in an iniquitous manner, by adopting double standards or by
foul play, would fall in this category.
(v) Was the act of the delinquent, which resulted in
the infliction of the punishment of dismissal or removal from
service, otherwise unacceptable, for the conferment of the
benefits flowing out of Rule 41 of the Pension Rules, 1972?
Illustratively, any action which is considered as depraved,
perverted, wicked, treacherous or the like, as would
disentitle      an   employee       for   such   compassionate
consideration.”
7. It may be pertinent to note that in Mahinder Dutt Sharma
(supra) also the Government servant was dismissed from service for
unauthorised absence. Dilating on that aspect the Apex Court made
“17.....Even though the charge proved against the appellant
pertains to his unauthorised and wilful absence from service, there
is nothing on the record to reveal, that his absence from service
was aimed at seeking better pastures elsewhere. No such
inference is even otherwise possible, keeping in view the length of
service rendered by the appellant. There is no denial that the
appellant was involved, during the period under consideration, in a
criminal case, from which he was subsequently acquitted. One of
his brothers died, and thereafter, his father and brother's wife also
passed away. His own wife was suffering from cancer. All these
tribulations led to his own ill-health, decipherable from the fact
that he was suffering from hypertension and diabetes. It is these
considerations, which ought to have been evaluated by the
competent authority, to determine whether the claim of the
appellant deserved special consideration, as would entitle him to
compassionate allowance under Rule 41 of the Pension Rules,
8. Here also the petitioner was dismissed from service for
unauthorised absence, which does not fall under any of the
illustrations in Mahinder Dutt Sharma (supra). The petitioner's
wife and children being employed cannot, by itself, lead to the
conclusion that the the petitioner's case does not deserve special
consideration. In this regard, the following observations in Exhibit
R2(b) report of assessment assumes relevance:
“...He told both of his sons are married and living
independently away from his residence. He further stated that
he had undergone five surgeries related to fistula, prostrate,
hernia etc. and his health is in poor state. He told he is a
dependent of his employed wife and don't have his own
income and he has to request his wife for financial assistance
to meet his own day to day needs which is embarrassing.”
9. Surprisingly, no reference is made to Mahinder Dutt
Sharma (supra) in Exhibit P12 order, in spite of the judgment having
been placed before the authority. Even in the counter affidavit, there
is nothing other than a bare statement that the decision in
Mahinder Dutt Sharma (supra) is not applicable to the facts of the
case. The petitioner's entitlement for compassionate allowance being
indisputable in the light of Mahinder Dutt Sharma (supra), I am
compelled to set aside Exhibit P12.
In the result, the writ petition is allowed, Exhibit P12 order is set
aside and the 1st respondent is directed              to reconsider the
petitioner's request for compassionate allowance and pass orders
thereon within two months of receipt of a copy of this judgment.
