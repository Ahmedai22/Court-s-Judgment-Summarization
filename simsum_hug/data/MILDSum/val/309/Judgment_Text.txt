3. This petition has been filed by the father of Harshitha Baid who is
presently living in Bangladesh along with her husband, on the following
(a) The daughter of the petitioner has clearly been a victim of
radicalization, undue influence, coercion, abduction and captivity violating
all her rights and human dignity and any consent or clearance by the
respondents 1, 2 & 4 towards grant of citizenship of Bangladesh would
W.P.No.14971 of 2020
irretrievably damage chances of her retrieval.
(b) The abduction of the petitioner's daughter is the subject matter of
investigation by the third respondent in RC-27/2020/NIA/DLI and any
issuance of any certificate of renunciation of citizenship or No objection
would render the investigation redundant.
(c) The petitioner's daughter's application seeking for citizenship of
Bangladesh is not voluntary, but under threat, coercion and undue influence
and therefore, it cannot be considered.
(d) The powers conferred under the Citizenship Act and Citizenship
Rules have to be exercised after taking into consideration all the relevant
materials and the fourth respondent cannot mechanically register the
declaration without going into the question whether it has been voluntarily
made or not.
(e) The consequences of issuance of any certificate or registration of
any declaration involving the right to life and liberty of the petitioner's
daughter enshrined under Article 21 of the Constitution and therefore,
requires intervention of the Court. This also will constitute the rights of the
petitioner and his wife as well being of their daughter is intrinsic to life and
dignity of the parents.
W.P.No.14971 of 2020
(f) Despite objections being sent for grant of a no objection
certificate/certificate of renunciation of citizenship, the non-response of the
Consular Officer and any proceedings without hearing the objections of the
petitioner will be an arbitrary exercise of power, violative of principles of
natural justice.
4. Subsequent to the filing of this writ petition, the following are the
undisputed facts:
(a) An Habeas Corpus Petition HCP was filed by the very same
petitioner seeking for deportation of his daughter Harshitha Baid from
Bangladesh to India. By order dated 22.02.2021 passed in HCP.No.49 of
2021, the said petition came to be closed after recording the statement made
by Harshitha Baid through Video Conferencing that only on her own
volition, she had got converted to Islam and only voluntarily, she has
applied for Bangladesh citizenship.
(b) The National Investigation Agency on 19.05.2022 filed a closure
report with regard to the complaint lodged by the petitioner for the alleged
offence under sections 120B, 294(b), 363, 364A, 368, 370, 384 & 506(i) of
IPC against the accused in Crime No.218 of 2020. The said report has also
W.P.No.14971 of 2020
been filed before the Special Court of NIA Cases in Poonamallee on
19.05.2022. It is also not disputed that based on the closure report, the
Special Court had reserved the matter for orders on 12.08.2022.
5. The petitioner's daughter Harshitha Baid is a major and her present
age is 25. The petitioner has filed this writ petition to forbear the
respondents 1 & 2 and its subordinate officials including the fourth
respondent from registering the declaration of renunciation of Citizenship or
granting no objection certificate/certificate of renunciation of citizenship to
Harshitha Baid, his daughter.
6. In view of the above undisputed facts, subsequent to the filing of
this writ petition, the question of granting relief in favour of the petitioner as
sought for in this writ petition will not arise. Therefore, there is no merit in
this writ petition. Accordingly, this writ petition is dismissed. No costs.
Consequently, connected miscellaneous petition is closed.
