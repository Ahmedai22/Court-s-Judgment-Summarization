1. This appeal is directed against the judgment dated 13th July,
2006 passed by the learned Sessions Judge, Keonjhar convicting
the Appellant for the offence punishable under Section 302 IPC
and sentencing him to undergo imprisonment for life in ST Case
No.18 of 2004.
2. By an order dated 19th October 2012, this Court enlarged the
Appellant on bail.
3. This Court has heard the submissions of Mr. R. N. Parija,
learned counsel appointed by the High Court Legal Services
JCRLA 96 of 2006                                      Page 1 of 4
Committee to appear for the Appellant and Mr. A. P. Das, learned
Additional Standing Counsel for the State-Respondent.
4. The case of the prosecution is that the mother of the accused
had left the house after quarrelling with his father. The accused
was said to have been upset and threatened his father. The
deceased, who happened to be the elder cousin brother of the
accused, protested this act of the accused. A quarrel ensued
between them. However, at that point in time, the dispute
subsided and, in the evening, both the accused and the deceased
took their meals in the house of the accused. The deceased slept in
the verandah.
5. At around 11.30 PM, on hearing the shout of the deceased, the
Informant-Nakula Behera (P.W.1), the father of the deceased and
the uncle of the accused woke up and saw the accused standing
with a Bala and his son, the deceased, lying with head injuries.
P.W.1 chased the accused, who ran away throwing the Bala at the
spot.
6. P.W.1 lodged the report at the Bamebari Outpost. Mr. Pradeep
Kumar Baral (P.W.8) was the Investigating Officer (IO), who on
14th June, 2003 at around 7 AM took down the complaint in
writing, registered the case and took up investigation. On 15 th
June 2003, he seized the wearing apparels of the deceased and on
the same day at 10.30 AM arrested the accused and seized the
wearing apparels of the accused. Meanwhile, the dead body of the
deceased was sent for Post-Mortem (PM). The charge was laid
against the accused for the offence under Section 302 IPC. He
pleaded not guilty and claimed trial.
7. Eight witnesses were examined for the prosecution and none
for the defence.
8. P.W.1, the informant, spoke clearly and cogently about he
having witnessed the incident. In his cross-examination, he made
clear that a ‘Dibiri’ was burning in the room and he was clearly
able to recognize the accused. He also mentioned how his wife
and his daughter, Bilasini (P.W.3) also woke up and saw the
accused run away. He said “to my knowledge, there was no
enmity between the accused and the deceased.” Barring the above
sentence, nothing else emerged in the cross-examination of this
witness to doubt the veracity of his testimony.
9. It is sought to be argued that the above sentence in the cross-
examination shows there was no motive for the crime. However,
P.W.3 said that “at evening, the accused being drunk came to our
house and there was exchange of words between my brother and
accused. Being asked by us, the accused went away to his house.”
Clearly therefore, there was a quarrel between the deceased and
the accused in the evening whereas the murder took place in the
night while the deceased was sleeping. Although P.W.3 said in the
cross-examination “there was no quarrel between the accused and
deceased prior to this incident”, what she was referring to were
incidents prior to the quarrel that took place between the accused
and the deceased. The evidence of P.W.4, who was another uncle
of the accused and the deceased, is not very helpful to either side
although he says accused and the deceased were in good terms.
The seizure witnesses have also supported the case of the
JCRLA 96 of 2006                                        Page 3 of 4
prosecution. Blood stains were detected on the Bala but the blood
grouping and the origine could not be detected.
10. This is not a case of mistaken identity since all the witnesses
are close relations of both the accused and the deceased. The fact
that the accused hits the deceased with Bala on the head clearly
reveals his intention to cause the death of the deceased. This was
not on the spur of the moment. The quarrel happened in the
evening whereas the incident happened in the night when the
deceased was sleeping and wholly unarmed. There was no need
for the close relations of the accused to falsely implicate him in
the homicidal death of the deceased.
11. The evidence being clear and cogent, the Court finds no
reason to interfere with the well-reasoned judgment of the trial
Court. There is no merit in this appeal and it is dismissed as such.
12. The bail bond of the Appellant is cancelled and he is directed
to surrender forthwith and in any event, not later than 1 st June,
2022 failing which the IIC concerned Police Station will take
steps to have him apprehended in order to serve out the remainder
of the sentence.
