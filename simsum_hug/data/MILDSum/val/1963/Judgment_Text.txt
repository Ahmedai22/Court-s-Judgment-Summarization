1.     Heard Sri Shyam Shankar Mishra, learned counsel for the
petitioner and learned Standing Counsel for the State.
2.     This writ petition under Article 226 of the Constitution of India
has been filed by the petitioners seeking protection of their lives and
liberties as they are major and by way of this writ petition, the
petitioners has prayed for following reliefs :
"A. Issue a writ order or direction in the nature of Mandamus
commanding and directing the respondents not to harass or take any
coercive action in any manner against the petitioners and also not to
interfere in the peaceful living of the petitioners as husband and wife.
B. Issue a writ order or direction in the nature of Mandamus
Commanding and directing the respondent No.3 not to harass and
interfere in peaceful life of the petitioners.
C. Issue any suitable writ, order or direction which this Hon'ble Court
may deem fit and proper under the facts and circumstances of the case to
meet the ends of justice.
3.     Facts and chronology of events show that the petitioner No.1,
Smt. Sunita Devi, was married with respondent No.3, Ranveer Singh
as per her own version in Annexure No.1 on 6.5.2010 and there are
children born out of the said wedlock. Her husband is serving in
poultry form. It is her version that she was being harassed as he had
come into contact with bad elements and used to come home only at
midnight. When she complained to her parents, they scolded him,
thereafter, the situation was pacified for some months but, again he
started doing the same. On 7.9.2021, he came with his friends and
wanted her to have illicit relations with his friends which she refused
and at night, when her husband and children were sleeping, she left
the matrimonial home. This all has been stated in the complaint dated
1.9.2021 written to Superintendent of Police, Etawah.
4.     We are unable to reconcile as to how incident of 7.9.2021 can
be narrated in a complaint dated 1.9.2021. There was no mention
whether the same was posted to the police authority or not. Be that as
it may, immediately thereafter, on 22.10.2021, this writ petition was
5.     Till September, 2021 she was with respondent No.3 and
daughters. Since when petitioner No.1 and Petitioner No.2 are living
as husband and wife is not disclosed. When did the husband,
respondent No.3, threatened their relation is also not disclosed.
Similar situation arose before the Punjab and Haryana High Court in
the case of Himani and another vs. State of Haryana, CRWP-
11197-2021 (O&M) decided on 26.11.2021 where the length of live-
in-relationship was not even mentioned. In our case also, there is no
indication as to when the petitioners started living together. Petitioner
No.1 wants to live with petitioner No.2 without taking proper divorce
and/or she does not even want to have marital relationship with
respondent No.3 and no reasons have been assigned for such a drastic
6.     Learned counsel for the petitioner has relied on the decision in
Indra Sarma vs. V.K. Sarma, AIR 2014 SC 309. The judgment cited
by the petitioner is about believing of relationship where there is
domestic violence perpetrated and defence is taken that there was no
7.     The decision in Indra Sarma (Supra) has been pressed into
service, more particularly paragraph 23, which reads as under :
"23. Marriage is often described as one of the basic civil rights of
man/woman, which is voluntarily undertaken by the parties in public in a
formal way, and once concluded, recognizes the parties as husband and
wife. Three elements of common law marriage are (1) agreement to be
married (2) living together as husband and wife, (3) holding out to the
public that they are married. Sharing a common household and duty to
live together form part of the 'Consortium Omnis Vitae" which obliges
spouses to live together, afford each other reasonable marital privileges
and rights and be honest and faithful to each other. One of the most
important invariable consequences of marriage is the reciprocal support
and the responsibility of maintenance of the common household, jointly
and severally. Marriage as an institution has great legal significance and
various obligations and duties flow out of marital relationship, as per
law, in the matter of inheritance of property, successionship, etc.
Marriage, therefore, involves legal requirements of formality, publicity,
exclusivity and all the legal consequences flow out of that relationship."
8.     The above paragraph will not apply to the facts of this case,
reason being, the marriage and family are social institution of vital
importance. Paragraph 24 of the said decision reads as follows:
"24. Marriages in India take place either following the personal Law of
the Religion to which a party is belonged or following the provisions of
the Special Marriage Act. Marriage, as per the Common Law,
constitutes a contract between a man and a woman, in which the parties
undertake to live together and support each other. Marriage, as a
concept, is also nationally and internationally recognized. O'Regan, J.,
in Dawood and Another v. Minister of Home Affairs and Others 2000 (3)
SA 936 (CC) noted as follows:
"Marriage and the family are social institutions of vital importance.
Entering into and sustaining a marriage is a matter of intense private
significance to the parties to that marriage for they make a promise to
one another to establish and maintain an intimate relationship for the
rest of their lives which they acknowledge obliges them to support
one another, to live together and to be faithful to one another. Such
relationships are of profound significance to the individuals
concerned. But such relationships have more than personal
significance at least in part because human beings are social beings
whose humanity is expressed through their relationships with others.
Entering into marriage therefore is to enter into a relationship that
has public significance as well.
The institutions of marriage and the family are important social
institutions that provide for the security, support and companionship
of members of our society and bear an important role in the rearing
of children. The celebration of a marriage gives rise to moral and
legal obligations, particularly the reciprocal duty of support placed
upon spouses and their joint responsibility for supporting and raising
children born of the marriage. These legal obligations perform an
important social function. This importance is symbolically
acknowledged in part by the fact that marriage is celebrated
generally in a public ceremony, often before family and close
9.     In the light of the aforesaid, it cannot be said that the
relationship outside the matrimony has also to be recognized under
Indian law. Paragraph 52 of the said judgment categorically mentions
that Live-in relation as such is a relation which has not been socially
accepted in India unlike many other Countries.
10.     Thus, saying that India is governed by Constitution of India and
we are not living in primitive days makes no difference as in the
present case it cannot be said that petitioners are living as husband and
wife and it is evident from the record and submission of learned
counsel for the petitioner that the marriage of petitioner No.1, Sunita
Devi, with respondent No.3, Ranveer Singh, has not yet been
dissolved. Moreover, there is nothing on record to show as to when
the respondent No.3 threatened her while being in live-in-relation as
till September, 2021 she says that she was with her husband and
11.     We have occasion to deal with grant of protection to two
persons of the same gender. Constitution of India may permit live-in-
relation but, this writ petition is nothing else but filed with a purpose
of obtaining seal of this Court on their illegal relationship.
12.     However, recently the Division Bench of this Court in Writ C
No.19795 of 2021 (Shayara Khatun@ Shaira Khatun and another
vs. State of U.P. and others) decided on 26.10.2021 has held as
"In such view of the matter, we are of the opinion that police authorities
are obligated to protect the rights of the petitioners.
In the event, the petitioners approach the police authorities complaining
of any threat to their life and liberty, we hope and trust that the police
authorities shall perform their duties as expected from them under law."
13.     Constitutional mandate will not permit us to pass orders which
cannot be passed in a writ petition under Article 226 of the
Constitution. We have determined whether there is any act, omission
or conduct of the respondent which would permit us to issue direction
of no coercive action or granting protection. List of dates and events
goes to show that the petitioner No.1 has come with an incorrect facts
deliberately as her complaint has not culminated into F.I.R. being
lodged. We are not even made aware whether the said complaint was
posted or not, reason being, this writ petition has been filed
immediately namely on 22/23.10.2021 and then there is no prolonged
cohabitation of live in relation as contended in the ground of petition
as according to her, she left matrimonial home leaving behind her
husband and children on 07.9.2021. This is a gray area which police
will have to investigation. The domestic relationship as defined by the
Apex Court in the case of Indra Sarma (Supra) will not apply to the
facts of this case.
14.    Paragraph 65 of the said decision also goes contrary to the
contention raised by the petitioner. However, we believe that even a
person alleged of commission of any offence, if is threatened with dire
consequences of life, he/she can pray for protection under Article 21
of the Constitution of India.
15.    The factual scenario will not permit us to grant prayer 'A' as it
would be against the very tenets of marital life of people. The personal
autonomy rather than notion of social morality can be looked into but
not at the stage when there is less period of cohabitation. There is no
threat perception and no such complaint has been made to the police
authority. Reference can also be had to the Division Bench of this
Court penned by one of us (Dr. Kaushal Jayendra Thaker) in Writ C
No. 14443 of 2021 (Smt. Aneeta and another vs. State of U.P. and
others) decided on 29.7.2021.
16.    In the present case, nothing is demonstrated that the husband,
respondent No.3, has even remotely threatened this relationship. The
threatening, if any, can be culled out is, of the incident narrated in the
complaint dated 1.9.2021. The police would investigate this if at all
there is semblance of truth in accordance with law.
17.    In view of the above, this writ petition is dismissed with cost of
Rs.5,000/- because there is no threat perception as prayed by
petitioners from respondent No.3. The Constitution of India does not
permit us to issue mandamus when there is no threat perception
alleged or transpired.
18.    However, if the petitioner No.1 moves the Police authorities
showing that she has genuine grievances or threat to her life, the
police authority may do the needful after verification of all facts as
narrated by her in the complaint made in September, 2021 to
Superintendent of Police, Etawah.
