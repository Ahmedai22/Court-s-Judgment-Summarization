The Madras High Court conducted a special sitting on Sunday after an urgent petition was filed seeking bail for an incarcerated accused on the ground that his father had died and he, being an only son was to perform the last rites. The counsel for the petitioner had moved before the Chief Justice to hear the matter urgently. Accordingly, the matter was heard today by a bench of Justice G Jayachandran. The accused is charged under section 399 (Making preparation to commit dacoity) of IPC and had been remanded to judicial custody on August 6. The Government Advocate opposed the plea on the ground that the petitioner had been previously charged under the NDPS Act. Further, there was a threat to his life by the rival gang. It was also submitted that the last rites of the petitioner's father was conducted yesterday and hence there was no merits to grant bail. The court, however, granted an interim bail of 3 days to the Petitioner, subject to his own bond, to enable him to perform post rituals. He has been directed to report and surrender before the authorities on 24th.
