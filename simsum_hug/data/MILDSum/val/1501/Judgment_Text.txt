1.      Detailed submissions on various applications, including applications
seeking leave to defend filed on behalf of the defendants, were heard on 10th
July, 2022, 23rd August, 2022 and 5th September, 2022, when judgment was
reserved and one week‟s time was granted to the parties to file written
submissions. Written submissions were duly filed on behalf of the parties in
both suits.
2.      On 11th October, 2022, the matter was mentioned on behalf of counsel
for the defendants in order to bring to the knowledge of the Court the
subsequent developments regarding insolvency proceedings having been
filed against the defendant no.1. Accordingly, the matter was listed for
directions on 17th October, 2022. Counsels for the parties sought time to
make submissions in respect of the subsequent developments and the matter
was posted on 27th October, 2022. On the said date, an additional affidavit
and a fresh application, being I.A.17487/2022, under Order VII Rule 11 of
the CPC filed on behalf of the defendant no.1, were on record. Submissions
on behalf of the parties were heard and the judgment was reserved again.
3.      Since similar issues arise in both the suits, they are being decided by
way of a common judgment.
4.      Brief facts in CS(COMM) 8/2021 are set out below.
4.1.    CS(COMM) 8/2021 is a summary suit filed on behalf of Axis Trustee
Services Limited under Order XXXVII of the CPC seeking recovery
of EUR 64,751,108.73 from the defendants no.1 and 2. Defendants
no.1 and 2 are the ex-promoters of Bhushan Steel Limited (renamed
as Tata Steel BSL Limited)/the borrower [hereinafter “Bhushan
4.2.    A Facility Agreement dated 14th April, 2011 [hereinafter “Facility
Agreement”] was executed between Bhushan Steel and various
financial creditors.  Pursuant to the said Facility Agreement, the
plaintiff was appointed as the security agent vide Security Agent
Agreement dated 18th May, 2011 to look after the beneficial interest
of the lenders. The repayment obligations of Bhushan Steel were
secured by way of a personal guarantee given jointly by the
guarantors, being the defendants no.1 and 2.
4.3.   Bhushan Steel defaulted in repayment of the principal installments
under the Facility Agreement from 30th April, 2015 as also on the
payment of interest. Upon default, personal guarantee was invoked
by the plaintiff acting in his capacity as a security agent vide
Invocation Notice dated 8th November, 2017.
4.4.   The Corporate Insolvency Resolution Process (CIRP) was initiated
against Bhushan Steel before the Principal Bench of the National
Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) vide order dated 26th July, 2017. In
the said proceedings, the Financial Creditors filed a claim for the
outstanding amounts in terms of the Facility Agreement. An amount
of EUR 156,929,177.43 was admitted by the Resolution Professional
of Bhushan Steel as the financial debt owed to the Financial Creditor.
As a part of the Resolution Plan dated 3rd February, 2018, approved
by the NCLT on 15th May, 2018, a total amount of EUR
92,178,068.70 was received by the Financial Creditor on 29th and 30th
May, 2018. In terms of Clause 8.7.3(vi) of the approved Resolution
Plan, Financial Creditors of Bhushan Steel were given right to recover
any unresolved financial debt, owed by the borrower, from the
guarantors in terms of the personal guarantee issued by them.
Pursuant thereto, vide a Demand Notice dated 20th October, 2020, the
financial creditors demanded payment of EUR 64,751,108.73/- from
the defendants (guarantors). No reply to the said notice was received,
nor was the due amount paid to the financial creditors. Accordingly,
the present suit has been filed seeking recovery of EUR
4.5.    Summons in CS(COMM) 8/2021 were issued on 16th April, 2021 and
were accepted in Court by the counsel appearing on behalf of the
defendants no.1 and 2. On the said date, counsel for the defendants
submitted that insolvency proceedings against the defendant no.2
have been initiated before the NCLT and therefore, the suit cannot
proceed against the defendant no.2. Taking note of the aforesaid
submission, the defendant no.1 was directed to maintain status quo in
respect of his immovable properties and no orders were passed against
the defendant no.2.
5.      Brief facts in CS(COMM) 20/2021 are set out below.
5.1.    CS(COMM) 20/2021 is a summary suit filed on behalf of
Norddeutsche Landesbank under Order XXXVII of the CPC seeking
recovery of EUR 44,102,086.02/-         from the defendants, being
personal guarantors, in respect of three Guarantee Agreements
executed in favour of the plaintiff for securing payment of amounts
under three separate Facility Agreements executed in favour of
Bhushan Steel/the borrower. As on 29th May, 2018, the total claim of
the plaintiff was EUR 103,331,481.86/-with applicable interest, out of
which EUR 60,769,146.46/- was admitted and received by the
plaintiff in the CIRP.    The total outstanding amount as on 18th
November, 2020 and accordingly claimed in the suit is EUR
44,102,086.02/-, which includes applicable interest.
5.2.     Summons in the suit were issued on 15th January, 2021 and the
defendants were directed to maintain status quo in respect of their
movable and immovable assets. The defendants were further directed
to file affidavits within two weeks giving details of their assets and
the status of the said assets. An appeal was filed against the orders
dated 15th January, 2021 and 16th December, 2021 in CS(COMM)
20/2021. The said appeal is pending before the Division Bench.
6.       In view of insolvency proceedings having been initiated against both
the defendants no.1 and 2, the first issue to be decided is whether the present
suits can proceed against the defendants in view of applications having been
filed under Section 95 of the IBC against both the defendants.
7.       In this regard, counsel for the defendants has made the following
i.       Insolvency proceedings were initiated against the defendant no.2 by
L&T Finance Limited before the NCLT, Delhi on 4th March, 2020
and therefore, in light of Section 96 of the IBC, the interim
moratorium would come into effect and the present suits would not be
maintainable against the defendant no.2.
ii.      The NCLT is the appropriate forum for adjudicating the personal
insolvency of the defendants. Reliance is placed on Section 179 read
with Section 60 of the IBC to submit that insolvency proceedings in
respect of personal guarantors of a corporate debtor would lie before
the NCLT and not a Debt Recovery Tribunal (DRT). Reliance is also
placed on the judgment of the Supreme Court in Embassy Property
Development Pvt. Ltd. v. State of Karnataka &Ors., (2020) 13 SCC
iii.     The moratorium under Section 96 of the IBC is „debt centric‟.
Therefore, it would be applicable to both the defendants no.1 and 2,
who are co-guarantors, as the debt is common to both of them and is
not separable. Reliance in this regard is placed on the judgment of the
Supreme Court in State Bank of India v. V. Ramakrishnan and Anr.,
iv.      In any event, in view of the insolvency proceedings being initiated
against the defendant no.1 on 28th May, 2022, the present suits cannot
proceed against the defendant no.1. The relevant date for the interim
moratorium under Section 96 is the date of filing of an application
under Section 94/95 of the IBC.
v.       Without prejudice to the above, even if the date, when the insolvency
application against the defendant no.1 was registered i.e. 3rd October,
2022, is considered, the present suits still cannot proceed any further
as the judgment was yet to be pronounced on the said date and the
suits were pending. Reliance in this regard is placed on the judgments
in State Bank of India and Others v. S.N. Goyal, (2008) 8 SCC 92
and Stichting Doen-postcode Loterij v. Vin Poly Recyclers Pvt. Ltd.
8.       On the other hand, senior counsel appearing on behalf of the plaintiffs
has made the following submissions:
i.    The insolvency resolution process and bankruptcy for individuals is
governed under Part III of the IBC. In terms of Sections 78 and 79,
the adjudicating authority for personal insolvency matter is the DRT
and not the NCLT.       Therefore, the defendants cannot claim any
moratorium on the basis of an application filed under Section 95 of
the IBC before the NCLT, which has no jurisdiction to entertain the
same.
ii.    Section 60 only contemplates a situation where the CIRP in respect of
the corporate debtor is pending. Otherwise, for the purposes of Part III
of the IBC, the DRT alone is the adjudicating authority vested with
the power to deal with an application under Section 95 of the IBC. In
view of the fact that the CIRP in respect of the corporate debtor,
Bhushan Steel stands concluded, the insolvency proceedings against
the defendants could not have been filed before the NCLT.
Resultantly, the benefit of Section 96 of IBC is not available to the
defendants.
iii.    The defendant no.2 himself has objected to the maintainability of the
application filed against him under Section 95 of the IBC on the
ground that the NCLT does not have the jurisdiction. Therefore, the
defendant no.2 cannot be permitted to approbate and reprobate.
iv.     Without prejudice to the above, the effect of the interim moratorium
under Section 96 of the IBC would apply against all debts of a
particular individual and not of any other person or a co-guarantor.
v.     Under the Personal Guarantee dated 19th May, 2011, both the
defendants no.1 and 2 are jointly and severally liable towards the
plaintiff. Legal incapacity of the defendant no.2 cannot impact the
remedies against the other guarantor.
vi.     Though the application under Section 95 in respect of the defendant
no.1 was filed on 28th May, 2022, it was registered only on 3rd
October, 2022, when the judgment had been reserved in the present
cases. Once the judgment has been reserved in a matter, the
subsequent developments in the matter cannot come in the way of the
court pronouncing the judgment. Therefore, the interim moratorium
under Section 96 of the IBC in respect of the defendant no.1 cannot
come in the way of the Court pronouncing its judgment in the present
suits.
vii.    The effect of a moratorium has to be assessed by the court and the
court cannot take a blinkered approach.      The pronouncement of
judgment in the present proceedings would not have an effect of
diminishing the assets of the defendants. Reliance in this regard is
placed on the judgment in SSMP Industries Ltd. v. Perkan Food
9.      I shall now proceed to deal with the rival contentions raised by the
counsels appearing on behalf of the parties.
10.     To appreciate the aforesaid submissions, a reference may be made to
the relevant provisions of the IBC. Part II of the IBC deals with
PERSONS” and Section 60 of the IB Coccurs in Chapter VI of Part II of the
IBC      titled  “ADJUDICATING        AUTHORITY        FOR          CORPORATE
PERSONS.” The relevant portion of Section 60 of the IBC is set out below:
―60. (1) The Adjudicating Authority, in relation to
insolvency resolution and liquidation for corporate persons
including corporate debtors and personal guarantors thereof
shall be the National Company Law Tribunal having territorial
jurisdiction over the place where the registered office of the
corporate person is located.
(2) Without prejudice to sub-section (1) and notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained in this Code, where a
corporate insolvency resolution process or liquidation
proceeding of a corporate debtor is pending before a National
Company Law Tribunal, an application relating to the insolvency
resolution or bankruptcy of a personal guarantor of such
corporate debtor shall be filed before such National Company
(3) An insolvency resolution process or bankruptcy proceeding of
a personal guarantor of the corporate debtor pending in any
court or tribunal shall stand transferred to the Adjudicating
Authority dealing with insolvency resolution process or
liquidation proceeding of such corporate debtor.
(4) The National Company Law Tribunal shall be vested with all
the powers of the Debt Recovery Tribunal as contemplated under
Part III of this Code for the purpose of sub-section (2).‖
11.     The term “personal guarantor” has been defined in Section 5(22) of
the IBC, which is as under:
―(22) "personal guarantor" means an individual who is the
surety in a contract of guarantee to a corporate debtor;‖
12.     Part III of the IBC deals with “INSOLVENCY RESOLUTION AND
BANKRUPTCY FOR INDIVIDUALS AND PARTNERSHIP FIRMS” and
the relevant portions of Sections 78 and 79 of the IBC, which are a part of
Chapter I of Part III are set out below:
―78. This Part shall apply to matters relating to fresh start,
insolvency and bankruptcy of individuals and partnership firms
where the amount of the default is not less than one thousand
Provided that the Central Government may, by
notification, specify the minimum amount of default of higher
value which shall not be more than one lakh rupees.
79.      In this Part, unless the context otherwise requires,—
(1) "Adjudicating Authority" means the Debt Recovery Tribunal
constituted under sub-section (1) of section 3 of the Recovery of
Debts Due to Banks and Financial Institutions Act, 1993;‖
13.     Next, a reference may be made to relevant portions of Sections 95 and
96 of the IBC, which occur in Chapter III of Part III of the IBC:
―95. (1) A creditor may apply either by himself, or jointly with
other creditors, or through a resolution professional to the
Adjudicating Authority for initiating an insolvency resolution
process under this section by submitting an application.
96. (1) When an application is filed under section 94 or
(a) an interim-moratorium shall commence on the date of
the application in relation to all the debts and shall cease to
have effect on the date of admission of such application; and
(b)    during the interim-moratorium period—
(i)    any legal action or proceeding pending in respect of any
debt shall be deemed to have been stayed; and
(ii) the creditors of the debtor shall not initiate any legal
action or proceedings in respect of any debt.‖
14.     A reference may also be made to Section 179 of the IBC, which is a
part of Chapter VI of the IBC dealing with “ADJUDICATING
―179. (1) Subject to the provisions of section 60, the
Adjudicating Authority, in relation to insolvency matters of
individuals and firms shall be the Debt Recovery Tribunal having
territorial jurisdiction over the place where the individual debtor
actually and voluntarily resides or carries on business or
personally works for gain and can entertain an application under
this Code regarding such person.‖
15.     The interplay between Section 60 and Section 179 of the IBC came up
for consideration before the Supreme Court in Embassy Property
Development (supra), wherein the Supreme Court observed that in respect
of personal guarantors of corporate persons, the NCLT would be the
adjudicating authority. The relevant observations of the Supreme Court are
set out below.
―33. Sub-section (4) of Section 60 of the IBC, 2016 states that
the NCLT will have all the powers of the DRT as contemplated
under Part III of the Code for the purposes of sub-section (2).
Sub-section (2) deals with a situation where the insolvency
resolution or liquidation or bankruptcy of a corporate guarantor
or personal guarantor of a corporate debtor is taken up, when
CIRP or liquidation proceeding of such a corporate debtor is
already pending before NCLT. The object of sub-section (2) is to
group together (A) the CIRP or liquidation proceeding of a
corporate debtor, and (B) the insolvency resolution or
liquidation or bankruptcy of a corporate guarantor or personal
guarantor of the very same corporate debtor, so that a single
forum may deal with both. This is to ensure that the CIRP of a
corporate debtor and the insolvency resolution of the individual
guarantors of the very same corporate debtor do not proceed on
different tracks, before different fora, leading to conflict of
interests, situations or decisions.
34.      If the object of sub-section (2) of Section 60 is to ensure
that the insolvency resolutions of the corporate debtor and its
guarantors are dealt with together, then the question that arises
is as to why there should be a reference to the powers of the DRT
in sub-section (4). The answer to this question is to be found in
Section 179 of the IBC, 2016. Under Section 179(1, it is the DRT
which is the adjudicating authority in relation to insolvency
matters of individuals and firms. This is in contrast to Section
60(1) which names the NCLT as the adjudicating authority in
relation to insolvency resolution and liquidation of corporate
persons including corporate debtors and personal guarantors.
The expression ―personal guarantor‖ is defined in Section
5(22) to mean an individual who is the surety in a contract of
guarantee to a corporate debtor. Therefore the object of sub-
section (2) of Section 60 is to avoid any confusion that may
arise on account of Section 179(1) and to ensure that whenever
a CIRP is initiated against a corporate debtor, NCLT will be the
adjudicating authority not only in respect of such corporate
debtor but also in respect of the individual who stood as surety
to such corporate debtor, notwithstanding the naming of the
DRT under Section 179(1) as the adjudicating authority for the
insolvency resolution of individuals. This is also why sub-
section (2) of Section 60 uses the phrase ―notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained in this Code.‖
16.     The NCLAT in its judgement dated 27thJanuary, 2022 in Company
Appeal (AT) Insolvency No. 60/2022 titled State Bank of India, Stressed
Asset Management Branch v. Mahendra Kumar Jajodia discussed the
provisions of Section 60 of the IBC and held that even if the CIRP in respect
of the corporate debtor is not pending before the NCLT, the NCLT would be
the appropriate forum for adjudicating an application under Section 95 in
respect of a personal guarantor. The relevant observations of the NCLAT are
―7.     Sub-Section 1 of Section 60 provides that Adjudicating
Authority for the corporate persons including corporate debtors
and personal guarantors shall be the NCLT. The Sub-Section 2
of Section 60 requires that where a CIRP or Liquidation
Process of the Corporate Debtor is pending before ‗a‘ National
Company Law Tribunal the application relating to CIRP of the
Corporate Guarantor or Personal Guarantor as the case may
be of such Corporate Debtor shall be filed before ‗such‘
National Company Law Tribunal. The purpose and object of
the sub-section 2 of Section 60 of the Code is that when
proceedings are pending in ‗a‘ National Company Law
Tribunal, any proceeding against Corporate Guarantor should
also be filed before ‗such‘ National Company Law Tribunal.
The idea is that both proceedings be entertained by one and the
same NCLT. The sub-section 2 of Section 60 does not in any way
prohibit filing of proceedings under Section 95 of the Code even
if no proceeding are pending before NCLT.
8.       The use of words ‗a‘ and ‗such‘ before National
Company Law Tribunal clearly indicates that Section 60(2) was
applicable only when a CIRP or Liquidation Proceeding of a
Corporate Debtor is pending before NCLT. The object is that
when a CIRP or Liquidation Proceeding of a Corporate Debtor
is pending before ‗a‘ NCLT the application relating to Insolvency
Process of a Corporate Guarantor or Personal Guarantor
should be filed before the same NCLT. This was to avoid two
different NCLT to take up CIRP of Corporate Guarantor. Section
60(2) is applicable only when CIRP or Liquidation Proceeding of
a Corporate Debtor is pending, when CIRP or Liquidation
Proceeding are not pending with regard to the Corporate Debtor
there is no applicability of Section 60(2).
9.       Section 60(2) begins with expression ‗Without prejudice
to sub-section (1)‘ thus provision of Section 60(2) are without
prejudice to Section 60(1) and are supplemental to sub-section
(1) of Section 60.
10.      Sub-Section 1 of Section 60 provides that Adjudicating
Authority in relation to Insolvency or Liquidation for
Corporate Debtor including Corporate Guarantor or Personal
Guarantor shall be the NCLT having territorial jurisdiction
over the place where the Registered Office of the Corporate
Person is located. The substantive provision for an
Adjudicating Authority is Section 60, sub-Section (1), when a
particular case is not covered under Section 60(2) the
Application as referred to in sub-section (1) of Section 60 can
be very well filed in the NCLT having territorial jurisdiction
over the place where the Registered Office of corporate Person
is located.
11.     The Adjudicating Authority erred in holding that since
no CIRP or Liquidation Proceeding of the Corporate Debtor
are pending the application under Section 95(1) filed by the
Appellant is not maintainable. The Application having been
filed under Section 95(1) and the Adjudicating Authority for
application under Section 95(1) as referred in Section 60(1)
being the NCLT, the Application filed by the Appellant was
fully maintainable and could not have been rejected only on the
ground that no CIRP or Liquidation Proceeding of the
Corporate Debtor are pending before the NCLT. In result, we
set aside the order dated 05thOctober, 2021 passed by the
Adjudicating Authority. The Application filed by the Appellant
under Section 95(1) of the Code is revived before the NCLT
which may be proceeded in accordance with the law.‖
17.     The statutory appeal, being Civil Appeal No(s).1871-1872/2022, filed
against the aforesaid order of the NCLAT, was dismissed by the Supreme
Court vide order dated 6th May, 2022.
18.     In view of the legal position elucidated above, it clear that Section
179(1), which provides the jurisdiction for the DRT with respect to
insolvency matters of individuals and firms, is subject to Section 60 of the
IBC. Sub-section (1) of Section 60 of the IBC provides that in relation to
insolvency resolution for corporate persons, including corporate debtors and
personal guarantors, the Adjudicating Authority shall be the NCLT.
Sub-section (2) of Section 60 provides that where the CIRP of a corporate
debtor is pending before an NCLT, an application relating to the insolvency
of a personal guarantor of such corporate debtor shall be filed before the
same NCLT. Sub-section (3) of Section 60 further provides that the
insolvency resolution process in respect of a personal guarantor pending in
any Court or Tribunal, shall stand transferred to the adjudicating authority
dealing with the insolvency resolution process of the corporate debtor.
19.     On behalf of the plaintiff, reliance has been placed on sub-section (2)
of Section 60 to contend that insolvency proceedings in respect of a personal
guarantor of a corporate debtor shall be filed in the NCLT only if the CIRP
is pending in respect of corporate debtor before the NCLT. In view of the
fact that the CIRP in respect of corporate debtor, Bhushan Steel already
stands concluded, insolvency proceedings in respect of its guarantors have to
be filed before the DRT and not the NCLT. The aforesaid submission
overlooks the fact that sub-section (2) of Section 60, IBC starts with words
‗without prejudice to sub-section (1)‘. Clearly, sub-section (2) of Section 60
is supplemental to sub-section (1) of Section 60 and has to be read along
with sub-section (1) of Section 60. A harmonious reading of the aforesaid
provisions would lead to the conclusion that sub-section (1) of Section 60
applies in respect of insolvency proceedings in respect of personal
guarantors of corporate debtors irrespective of the fact whether CIRP is
pending against the corporate debtor. The objective of sub-sections (2) and
(3) is that where proceedings in respect of a corporate debtor have been
initiated in one NCLT and those against a guarantor before another NCLT or
another court or tribunal while the CIRP is pending in respect of the
corporate debtor before a particular NCLT, the proceedings against the
personal guarantor should also be before the same NCLT.
20.     It may also be relevant to mention here that in term of Rule 3(1)(a) of
the Insolvency and Bankruptcy (Application to Adjudicating Authority for
Insolvency Resolution Process for Personal Guarantors to Corporate
Debtors), Rules, 2019, it has specifically been provided that the adjudicating
authority for the purposes of Section 60 would be the NCLT. No distinction
has been made under different sub-sections of Section 60 of the IBC in this
Rule with regard to the competent adjudicating authority.
21.    On behalf of the plaintiffs, it was further contended that the defendant
no.2 himself had objected to the maintainability of the aforesaid application
filed against the defendant no.2 under Section 95 of the IBC on the ground
that the NCLT does not have jurisdiction. In my view, even if such a stand
has been taken by the defendant no.2, the same would not constitute an
estoppel against the defendant no.2 as it was a legal objection taken by the
defendant no.2 and an admission in law cannot be held to be binding against
a party. An estoppel can be in respect of admissions made on facts, however,
there can be no estoppel on admissions based on law. In any event, the legal
position has emerged only after the dismissal of the appeal by the Supreme
Court in Mahendra Kumar Jajodia (supra). Therefore, the judgment in
Union of India and Others v. N. Murugesan and Others, (2022) 2 SCC 25
would not be of any assistance to the plaintiffs in the present case.
22.    In view of the discussion above, I am of the view that the NCLT
would be the appropriate adjudicating authority in respect of insolvency
proceedings initiated against the defendants in their capacity as personal
guarantors for the corporate debtor, Bhushan Steel.
23.    The insolvency proceedings against the defendant no.2 under Section
95 of the IBC were initiated before the NCLT on 4thMarch, 2020, before
filing of the present suits and in view thereof, the interim moratorium under
Section 96 would be operable insofar as the defendant no.2 is concerned.
24.    Now, I shall examine the effect of insolvency proceedings initiated
against the defendant no.1. As per the additional affidavit filed on behalf of
the defendant no.1, an insolvency application, being (IB)-710(PB)/2022,
was filed against the defendant no.1 by State Bank of India before the
NCLT, New Delhi on 28th May, 2022. The same was registered on 3rd
October, 2022. The application was listed before the NCLT on 7th October,
2022 and the matter was adjourned to 4th November, 2022. A reading of
Section 96 of the IBC makes it clear that the relevant date for the interim
moratorium to come into effect is the date ―when an application is filed
under Section 94/95‖. When the legislature has specifically used the word
―filed‖ in respect of an application under Section 94/95, the court cannot
read the same to mean the date when the application is “registered”, as is
sought to be contended on behalf of the plaintiffs.
25.    The very same submission made on behalf of the plaintiffs, that the
relevant date for purposes of interim moratorium under Section 96 should be
the date when the application is registered and not the date of filing, came up
for consideration before the NCLAT. The NCLAT in the judgment dated 6th
June, 2022 in Company Appeal (AT) (Insolvency) No.724/2022 titled
Dinesh Kumar Basia v. State Bank of India held that an application under
Section 95 is treated to be filed when it is filed in the office of the Registry
at the filing counter.    The submission of the appellant therein that the
application cannot be held to be filed unless it is numbered by the Registry
was rejected. The relevant observations of the NCLAT are set out below:
―13. Section 96 of the Code uses the expression – ―when an
application is filed under Section 94 and 95‖. What is the
meaning of filing an Application under Section 94 and 95 is
the question to be answered in these Appeal(s). Rule 2, sub-
rule (14) of the NCLT Rules itself defines the word ‗filed‘,
which is to the following effect:
―(14) ―filed‖ means filed in the office of the Registry of the
14. When we read Rule 2 (14) along with Rule 23 of NCLT
Rules, it is clear that Application is treated to be filed when it
is filed in the Office of the Registry at the filing counter. Thus,
filing on behalf of the Appellant/ Applicant is complete as
soon as the Application is presented at the filing counter of
the Office of the Registry. What is required to be done by the
Applicant by filing an Application is provided in Rules 22 to 24
and 26, which the Applicant has to comply with while
submitting the Application. The submission, which has been
pressed by the learned Counsel for the Appellant is that the
Application cannot be held to be filed unless it is numbered by
the Registry, that is, only when the Application is found defect
free and accorded a numbering by the Registry. Thus, a filing
within the meaning of 2019 Rules read with NCLT Rules, is the
filing at the filing counter or the filing is to be treated to be
filing only when it is numbered by the Office of the Registry, is a
question to be answered.
16. The expression ‗filing‘ is defined in several statutes. We
may first notice the dictionary meaning of filing. In P
Ramanatha Aiyar – Advanced Law lexicon (6th Edition Vol. 2,
D-1) defines the ‗filing‘ as follows:
―Filing. Delivery of a paper to the proper officer to be kept on
file; placing and leaving a paper among the files; placing a
paper in the proper official custody; presenting a paper at the
proper office and leaving it there, deposited with the papers in
such office; placing a paper in the proper official‘s custody by
the party charged with this duty, and the making of the proper
indorsement by the officer.‖
18. When as per Rule 10, sub-rule (2), when an electronic
facility is available and an Application is filed in electronic
form, the filing is complete as soon as it is registered
electronically, we do not find any support from the statutory
scheme to the submission of learned Counsel for the
Appellant that petition would be treated as filed when it is
numbered by the Registry. Numbering of an Application by
Registry is a process, which is undertaken by the Registry as
per the relevant rules and instructions. Several consequences
ensue on filing of the Application in the Registry, if it is
accepted that the filing shall be dependent on numbering of
the Application by the Registry. It will lead to uncertainty
regarding date of filing. When statutory consequences are
provided, there has to be certainty regarding such
consequences. We cannot accept any interpretation, which
may lead to uncertainty regarding the date of filing, resulting
in uncertainty, regarding enforcement of the Interim
Moratorium. Interim Moratorium has serious consequences,
which consequences flow immediately after filing of the
Application. If we accept the submission of the Appellant that
filing is postponed till it is numbered, it will lead to
uncertainty and allow the Guarantors and other Respondents
to delay the moratorium by pleading that filing is not
complete, since the Application has not yet numbered. The
statutory scheme, thus, does not in any manner support the
submission of learned Counsel for the Appellant. Numbering
of Application is essential for different purpose and cannot be
equated with the filing as contemplated by the Rules.‖
26.      In the present case, the application against the defendant no.1 has
been filed under Section 95 of the IBC by State Bank of India on 28 th May,
2022, as a creditor of the corporate debtor/borrower for whom the defendant
no.1 stood as a guarantor. Therefore, in my view, the relevant date on which
the interim moratorium under Section 96 would kick in would be 28th May,
27.    It is not the case of the plaintiffs that the application filed by State
Bank of India under Section 95 of the IBC against the defendant no.1 was
collusive. State Bank of India is placed in a similar situation as the plaintiffs
herein and is seeking to recover from the defendant no.1 the unresolved debt
in respect of the corporate debtor, Bhushan Steel. In fact, as is evident from
the application filed on behalf of State Bank of India, the debt of State Bank
of India is several times over the combined debt owed to the plaintiffs
herein. Therefore, this is not a case where the insolvency application has
been filed with a mala fide intention by a debtor/guarantor himself so as to
take the benefit of the interim moratorium under Section 96 of the IBC.
28.    Even if it is assumed that the relevant date for the interim moratorium
under Section 96 of the IBC to come into effect is 3 rd October, 2022 i.e. the
date on which the application filed by State Bank of India under Section 95
of the IBC was registered, it would make no difference as the judgment was
yet to be pronounced on the said date. A matter is said to be pending before
a court till the time judgment is pronounced, signed and dated. The
pronouncement of judgment in a case is a part of the proceedings in a suit.
Therefore, till the time a judgment is pronounced in a suit, the parties are
free to bring to the attention of the court any subsequent development that
may have occurred after the judgment was reserved in the matter, which
could have a bearing on the judgment to be delivered by the court. It is then
for the court to determine whether it is necessary to take cognizance of such
subsequent developments and whether any further hearing is required in the
matter before rendering the judgment.        Reference may be made to the
judgment in State Bank of India and Others v. S.N. Goyal, (2008) 8 SCC
92, wherein the Supreme Court has held that a Judge becomes functus officio
only after judgment is pronounced, signed and dated.
29.    In the present case, there was a significant development that came to
the knowledge of the defendants after the judgment was reserved, which is
filing of the insolvency application against the defendant no.1. This was
brought to the attention of the Court by filing an additional affidavit as well
as I.A. No.17487/2022. Taking cognizance of the aforesaid developments,
the submissions of the parties were heard.
30.    The mandate of Section 96 of the IBC is clear. The interim
moratorium under Section 96 of the IBC kicks in as soon as an application is
filed under Section 94/95 of the IBC and the effect of such interim
moratorium is that all pending legal proceedings are deemed to have been
stayed. This is in contrast to the moratorium under Section 14 of the IBC,
whereby the moratorium comes into effect only upon an order being passed
by the NCLT declaring a moratorium.
31.    A Division Bench of this Court in Stichting Doen-postcode Loterij v.
Vin Poly Recyclers Pvt. Ltd. & Ors., 2010 (115) DRJ 708 (DB) was seized
of a similar issue in a case where judgment was reserved on the leave to
defend application filed on behalf of the defendant herein.                  After the
judgment was reserved, the defendant/respondent therein made a reference
to BIFR that was registered under Section 22 of the erstwhile Sick Industrial
Companies (Special Provisions) Act, 1985 (SICA). The issue before the
Division Bench was whether the judgment could be pronounced in view of
the bar contained in Section 22 of SICA. The Division Bench held that the
judgment could not be pronounced in view of the bar contained under
Section 22. The relevant observations of the Division Bench as contained in
para 8 of the judgment are set out below:
―8.       We cannot but wonder, whether all the aforesaid steps
required by law to be taken in the event of the judgment being
reserved would not fall in ―proceedings‖. The literal meaning of
the language of Section 22 of the Act is that the status as prevailing
on the date of applicability of Section 22 is to remain unless the
permission of BIFR to proceed further is obtained. It would have
been open to the counsel for the appellant/plaintiff to contend that
such bar would not affect pronouncement of the judgment only if
no further proceedings were required to be undertaken by the court
thereafter and only if the action of the Court of pronouncement of
judgment was to relate back to the date of hearing. However, it is
not so in law. In the existing state of affairs, to differentiate between
the proceedings required to be taken for pronouncement of the
judgment and the proceeding required to be undertaken for taking
any other steps in the suit has no rational nexus. The purport of
Section 22 was to protect a sick company from the legal proceedings
of the nature mentioned in Section 22. Prior to amendment thereof,
suits were not included and the bar applied only to execution
proceedings. However, after the amendment in the year 1994, the
legislature deemed it appropriate to bar the institution of as well as
proceeding further with all the suits against such sick companies. If
it were to be held that the judgment could be pronounced, then we see
no reason why other proceedings in the suit, save a coercive
proceedings qua the assets of the sick company, could also not be
proceeded with further.‖
32.    The dicta of the aforesaid judgement is squarely applicable in the
present case. In view of the fact that the judgement was yet to be
pronounced, the legal proceedings in the present suits remained pending
when the interim moratorium with respect to the defendant no.1 under
Section 96 of the IBC came into effect. Therefore, the proceedings in the
present suits are liable to be stayed and judgment in respect of applications
seeking leave to defend cannot be pronounced.
33.    In SSMP Industries (supra) relied upon by the plaintiffs, the court
was faced with a situation when a counter claim was filed by the defendant
against the plaintiff/corporate debtor. It was in that situation that the court
noted that it would create a piquant situation if there is a moratorium in
respect of the counter claim and the suit continues to proceed in respect of
the claims of the plaintiff against the defendant.        There would be a
possibility of conflicting views in respect of the same transaction as the suit
in respect of the original claim of the plaintiff would be adjudicated by this
Court and the counter claim against the plaintiff would be adjudicated by the
NCLT. Faced with such a situation, the court did not apply the moratorium
in respect of the counter claim. This is not the situation here and therefore,
the observations of the court in the aforesaid case would not be of assistance
to the plaintiffs in the present case.
34.    Before the insolvency applications were filed against the defendant
no.1, counsel for the defendants had also contended that the interim
moratorium in respect of one of the co-guarantors would also apply to the
other co-guarantor for the same debt as the liability of both the co-
guarantors arise from the same debt. Reliance is placed on the words „any
debt‟ occurring in Section 96(1)(b) of the IBC. Though I need not delve into
this submission in view of the fact that insolvency proceedings have
subsequently been filed against the defendant no.1, however, since I have
heard the counsels for the parties extensively on this issue, I propose to
address the same.
35.    In my view, the language of Section 96(1) of the IBC cannot be
stretched so as to include all co-guarantors within the ambit of the interim
moratorium. The reference to „all the debts‟ in Section 96(1)(a) has to be in
respect of all debts of a particular debtor. This is clear from the language
used in Section 96(1)(b)(ii) to the effect that ‗the creditors of the debtor
shall not initiate any legal action or proceedings in respect of any debt.‘
Therefore, the effect of the interim moratorium is only in respect of the
debts of a particular debtor. By no stretch of imagination can it be said to
include other independent guarantors in respect of the same debt of a
corporate debtor. Merely because an interim moratorium under Section 96 is
operable in respect of one of the co-guarantors, the same would not apply to
the other co-guarantor(s).
36.    Counsel for the defendants has relied on the following paragraphs of
the judgment in V. Ramakrishna (supra):
―26. We are also of the opinion that Sections 96 and 101,
when contrasted with Section 14, would show that Section 14
cannot possibly apply to a personal guarantor. When an
application is filed under Part III, an interim-moratorium or a
moratorium is applicable in respect of any debt due. First and
foremost, this is a separate moratorium, applicable separately
in the case of personal guarantors against whom insolvency
resolution processes may be initiated under Part III. Secondly,
the protection of the moratorium under these sections is far
greater than that of Section 14 in that pending legal
proceedings in respect of the debt and not the debtor are stayed.
The difference in language between Sections 14 and 101 is for
a reason.
26.1. Section 14 refers only to debts due by corporate debtors,
who are limited liability companies, and it is clear that in the
vast majority of cases, personal guarantees are given by
Directors who are in management of the companies. The object
of the Code is not to allow such guarantors to escape from an
independent and co-extensive liability to pay off the entire
outstanding debt, which is why Section 14 is not applied to them.
However, insofar as firms and individuals are concerned,
guarantees are given in respect of individual debts by persons
who have unlimited liability to pay them. And such guarantors
may be complete strangers to the debtor — often it could be a
personal friend. It is for this reason that the moratorium
mentioned in Section 101 would cover such persons, as such
moratorium is in relation to the debt and not the debtor.
26.2. We may hasten to add that it is open to us to mark the
difference in language between Sections 14 and 96 and 101, even
though Sections 96 and 101 have not yet been brought into force.
This is for the reason, as has been held in State of Kerala v. Mar
Appraem Kuri Co. Ltd. [State of Kerala v. Mar Appraem Kuri
Co. Ltd., (2012) 7 SCC 106 : (2012) 4 SCC (Civ) 69] , that a law
―made‖ by the legislature is a law on the statute book even
though it may not have been brought into force.‖
37.     In the aforesaid judgment, the observations made by the Supreme
Court were in the context of moratorium under Section 101 applying to
guarantors of debts of individuals and firms. In the present case, the
defendant no.1 is not the guarantor in respect of the debt of the defendant
no.2. They are both independent guarantors in respect of the corporate
debtor, with joint and several liability. Therefore, the reliance placed on the
aforesaid judgment is misplaced. Creditors would have an independent
recourse against either of the guarantors and the inability to recover against
one of the guarantors would not come in the way of making recoveries
against the other guarantors. Even in terms of Section 43 of the Indian
Contract Act, a plaintiff can choose to proceed against one of the co-
promisors. Further, Sections 44 and 138 of the Contract Act provide that
discharge of one of the parties/sureties does not amount to discharge of the
other party/surety. Therefore, I am of the considered view that the interim
moratorium under Section 96 in respect of one of the guarantors would not
ipso facto apply against a co-guarantor.
38.    In view of the discussion above and the clear statutory mandate under
Section 96 of the IBC, the proceedings in the present suit are stayed against
both the defendants.
39.    Accordingly, I.A. 5554/2021 and I.A. No.17487/2022 in CS(COMM)
8/2021 and I.A. 4996/2021, I.A. 5013/2021 and I.A. 5663/2021 in
CS(COMM) 20/2021 stand disposed of.
