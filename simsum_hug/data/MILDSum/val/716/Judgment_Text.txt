20/10/2022, 21/10/2022, 28/10/2022, 15/11/2022 and 30/11/2022 AND THE
Dated this the 9th day of December, 2022
This report filed by the Special Commissioner, Sabarimala,
regarding the functioning of Safe Zone Project, Sabarimala, by the
Motor Vehicles Department was disposed of by the order dated
203] with the directions contained in paragraph 120 of the said
order. The 2nd respondent Transport Commissioner and the 3rd
respondent State Police Chief were directed to file action taken
reports before this Court on or before 01.07.2022, which was
directed to be placed before the Bench on 11.07.2022. Registrar
General was directed to forward a copy of the order dated
10.01.2022 to the Secretary, Supreme Court Committee on Road
Safety, for information.
2.    In the order dated 26.05.2022 [2022 SCC OnLine Ker
2906 : 2022 (4) KLT 934] this Court noticed that, despite the
directions contained in the order dated 10.01.2022, the Enforce-
ment Officers under the 2nd respondent Transport Commissioner
and the Police Officers under the 3rd respondent State Police Chief
are not taking earnest efforts to ensure strict enforcement of the
provisions under the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988, the Central Motor
Vehicles Rules, 1989, the Kerala Motor Vehicles Rules, 1989 and
the Motor Vehicles (Driving) Regulations, 2017, taking note of the
law laid down in the decisions referred to in the said order dated
10.01.2022. After the order of this Court dated 10.01.2022, in mo-
tor accidents involving contract carriages, the passengers in those
vehicles and other road users sustained serious/fatal injuries.
Since the use of contract carriages on public place, flouting the
safety standards prescribed in AIS-008 and AIS-052 (Rev.1) 2008,
etc. is posing potential threat to the safety of the passengers and
other road users, the learned Assistant Solicitor General of India
was requested on 26.05.2022, to address arguments on behalf of
the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways.
3.    The orders of this Court dated 06.10.2022 [2022 SCC
21.10.2022 and 28.10.2022 shall be read as part of this order.
4.    On    30.11.2022,   when   this  report   came  up   for
consideration, the learned Special Government Pleader was
directed to make available for the perusal of this Court the
inspection report along with colour photographs of contract
carriage bearing Registration No.KL-74/3303, prepared in terms of
the directions contained in the orders of this Court in this SSCR,
which was taken into custody by the Enforcement Officers of the
Motor Vehicles Department at Kochi, following a tip-off, and to
furnish the details of the registered owner of contract carriages
bearing Registration No.KL-74/3915 and KL-74/3303, the tour
operator, the head of the educational institution and also the
teachers who were in charge of the tour programme.
5.    In the order dated 30.11.2022, we noticed that the said
contract carriage, which was carrying 45 students from a school at
Thiruvananthapuram was fitted with unauthorised LED lights
capable of dazzling the drivers of oncoming vehicles directly, and
also the drivers of the vehicles proceeding in front, indirectly,
through rear-view mirrors and/or other reflecting surfaces of their
vehicle. Graphics, stickers, sun control film, etc., were pasted on
the safety glass. Stickers were pasted even on the windshield.
6.    Today, when this matter is taken up for consideration,
the learned Special Government Pleader has made available for
the perusal of this Court, the report dated 03.12.2022 of the
Regional     Transport   Officer    (Enforcement)    regarding   the
interception of contract carriage exhibiting Registration No.KL-
74/3915,       which    was      carrying   45     students    from
Thiruvananthapuram, without fitness certificate, insurance and
payment of road tax.
7.    The learned Special Government Pleader would submit
that he is yet to get a report regarding the details of the tour
operator, the head of the educational institution and also the
teachers who were in charge of that educational tour. The report
dated 03.12.2022 of the Regional Transport Officer (Enforcement)
and other materials shall be placed on record along with a memo
by 13.12.2022. The learned Special Government Pleader would
further submit that he is in receipt of the action taken report in
respect of auto show/exhibitions at Government Engineering
College, Wayanad and National Institute of Technology, Kozhikode,
which shall be placed on record along with a memo by 13.12.2022.
8.    The learned Deputy Solicitor General of India would
submit that he has already received necessary instructions from
the 6th respondent Ministry of Road Transport and Highways and
the 7th respondent Ministry of Electronics and Information
Technology. Detailed statements, based on the instructions already
received, shall be placed on record by 13.12.2022.
9.    In the order dated 14.10.2022, we have reproduced the
screenshots of the transport vehicle owned and operated by KURTC
exhibiting advertisements, figures, etc. causing distraction to the
drivers of other vehicles. The said screenshot is reproduced
10.   The direction contained in paragraph 64 of the order
dated 14.10.2022 reads thus;
64.   Therefore, the Enforcement Officers in the Motor Ve-
hicles Department and also the Police have to take neces-
sary action against the vehicles owned/operated by KSRTC
and KURTC which are used in public place after tampering
with the percentage of visual transmission of light of the
safety glass of the windscreen, rear window and side win-
dows of such vehicles, either by pasting any material upon
the safety glass or by fixing sliding ‘cloth curtains’, etc. Ac-
tion shall also be taken for exhibiting advertisements, fig-
ures, etc. causing distraction to the drivers of other vehicles
and also cyclists and pedestrians on public road, flouting the
statutory provisions referred to hereinbefore and also the
directions contained in the judgment of this Court in Saji
11.   The 2nd respondent Transport Commissioner, through
the concerned Enforcement Officers in the Motor Vehicles
Department shall ensure that two or three vehicles operated by
KSRTC for Nilakkal-Pamba chain service, which are wrapped with
advertisements as in the case of the vehicle in the photograph
reproduced hereinbefore at paragraph 9, are not used for the
transportation of pilgrims, openly flouting the prohibitory orders
issued by this Court.
12.   The report of the concerned Enforcement Officer, with
the photographs of those vehicles shall be placed on record by
13.   The learned Standing Counsel for KSRTC seeks time to
get instructions from the Special Officer, who is in charge of
Nilakkal-Pamba chain service.
