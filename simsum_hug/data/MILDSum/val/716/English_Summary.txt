The Kerala High Court on Friday directed the Transport Commissioner through the concerned Enforcement Officers in the Motor Vehicles Department to ensure that buses operated by KSRTC for Nilakkal-Pamba chain service, which are wrapped with advertisements, are not used for the transportation of Sabarimala pilgrims. 
The Court passed the direction noting that few KSRTC buses used for Nilakkal- Pamba chain services are wrapped in advertisements, openly flouting the prohibitory orders issued by the Court. 
The Division Bench of Justice Anil K. Narendran and Justice P. G. Ajithkumar had previously directed the Transport Commissioner and State Police Chief to ensure that no KSRTC bus exhibiting advertisements on the body are allowed to operate in public places. It said that advertisements are likely to distract the attention of other drivers.
Noting non-compliance of this direction in some cases the Bench ordered, 
The 2nd respondent Transport Commissioner, through the concerned Enforcement Officers in the Motor Vehicles Department shall ensure that two or three vehicles operated by KSRTC for Nilakkal-Pamba chain service, which are wrapped with advertisements...are not used for the transportation of pilgrims, openly flouting the prohibitory orders issued by this Court.
The Court has also directed the concerned Enforcement Officer to place a report on the aforesaid buses on record before the Court on 13th December.
The matter has been posted for 14th December for further consideration.
