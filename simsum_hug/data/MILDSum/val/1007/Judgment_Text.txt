Counsel for Petitioner :- Gaurav Mehrotra,Abhineet Jaiswal
Counsel for Respondent :- C.S.C.
1. Heard learned counsel for petitioner Sri Gaurav Mehrotra &
Sri Abhinit Jaiswal and learned Standing Counsel for the State.
2. Despite the best efforts of all still, how a working woman can
be harassed even in this era is reflected in the facts of the
present case. Petitioner, a doctor by qualification, after getting
selected by U.P. Public Service Commission, in furtherance of
appointment letter dated 01.09.2010, joined as a lecturer at the
Lala Lajpat Rai Memorial Medical College, Meerut & was
subsequently promoted to the post of Associate Professor. On
19.09.2018, the petitioner was transferred from Meerut Medical
College to Saharanpur Medical College. Though the petitioner
has challenged the aforesaid transfer order, it could not succeed.
Meanwhile, the State Government made an arrangement vide
Office Memorandum dated 19.07.2019 whereby the petitioner
along with some other Doctors were directed to render their
services at Saharanpur Medical College along with the previous
place of posting of petitioner i.e., Meerut Medical College.
3. The petitioner by means of several applications expressed her
difficulty in rendering the services & sought child-care leave on
account of medical issue of her daughter who has a severe case
of Bronchial Asthma and suffers from frequent Asthmatic
attacks which requires tonsillectory plus immune therapy as
well as constant care & attention.
4. The petitioner has further contended that neither her leave
was sanctioned nor the salary was paid to her. The petitioner
further submitted that she preferred a representation before
respondent No.1 on 01.01.2020 & 08.01.2020 apprising therein
that five applications had been preferred by her seeking child-
care leave & medical leave, however, none of them were
considered. It was also apprised that the petitioner has not even
been paid her salary for the period July 2019 to September 2019
& January 2020 to 24.02.2020. The petitioner by means of
representation dated 01.01.2020 & 08.01.2020 requested
respondent No.1 to consider her bonafide & genuine claim else
she will be left with no other choice than to resign from the
5. It had been further stated that when no action on the
aforesaid representation was taken by respondent No.1, the
petitioner ultimately tendered her resignation on 24.02.2020.
Shockingly, neither the resignation tendered by the petitioner
was accepted nor rejected by respondent No.1 till 23.05.2020
i.e., till 3 months notice period for accepting her resignation
6. It was after a lapse of more than 7 months from the date
when the petitioner tendered her resignation that the impugned
order dated 25.09.2020 was issued by respondent No.1 whereby
an enquiry on account of being absent from duty was initiated
against the petitioner. Further by means of another impugned
order dated 26.09.2020 issued by respondent No.1, the
resignation tendered by the petitioner was rejected on the
ground of public interest.
7. On 02.12.2020, when the present matter was taken up while
staying the disciplinary proceedings initiated against the
petitioner vide order dated 25.09.2020, this Court passed the
"Heard Shri Gaurav Mehrotra, learned counsel for petitioner
and Shri P. K. Singh, leamed Additional Chief Standing
Counsel for State.
Perused Annexure No. 8 which is, inter alia, a leave application
by petitioner which was not acceded to nor was it rejected by
communicating any such order. She tendered her resignation on
24.02.2020 as on account of the reasons mentioned in the said
letter and other reasons pertaining to the health of her child
etc. she was unable to leave Meerut permanently and work at
Saharanpur where she had been working since 2017 as alleged.
The notice period for resignation expired on 24.05.2020 during
which no decision was communicated to her. It is said that it is
only in July, 2020 that the Director General, Medical
Education and Training, U.P Lucknow communicated the offer
of resignation by petitioner dated 24.02.2020 to Principal
Secretary who instead of taking a decision on the same initiated
disciplinary proceedings against petitioner on 25.09.2020 for
absence w.e.f. 21.03.2020 inspite of her letter of resignation not
having been accepted in terms of Rule 4 and 5 of the Uttar
It is true that as per Rules and resignation becomes effective
only on being accepted and not otherwise and Rule 5(iii)
provides a ground for rejection of such offer of resignation if an
inquiry is contemplated or pending against applicant and in
ordinary course the petitioner if she was unable to work for the
reasons stated by her, she should have been taken leave instead
of abstaining from work, but considering the over all facts and
circumstances of the case, this is hardly a matter where action
as impugned herein should have been taken. After initiation of
disciplinary proceedings on 25.09.2020 her request for
resignation has been rejected on the next date i.e. 26.09.2020
Let opposite parties justify the impugned action in the facts of
the present case and as to why such a trivial matter should
culminate in such action. Why should the matter not be given a
quietus by accepting leave of petitioner without pay w.e.f.
21.03.2020 and allowing her to resign.
Let an affidavit be filed by the opposite parties positively within
a period of 10 days.
She is permitted to apply for leave as per rule w.e.f. 21.03.2020
albeit without pay. List/ put up on 15.12.2020 as fresh.
Till the next date of listing the disciplinary proceedings against
the petitioner shall remain stayed.
Let a copy of this order be given to learned counsel for parties
within 48 hours on payment of usual charges."
8. By means of the aforesaid order dated 02.12.2020 passed by
this Court, the opposite parties were given an opportunity to
justify their impugned action. Alternatively, this Court had also
indicated to the opposite parties to re-visit their orders by
expressing that such a trivial matter should be given quietus by
accepting leave of the petitioner without pay w.e.f. 21.03.2020
and allowing her to resign. However, in the Counter Affidavit,
there is no mention of the impugned orders having been
revisited by the opposite parties, as required by this Court.
9. The facts of the case clearly indicates that petitioner, a
mother was facing difficulty in handling both, a child in need of
care as well as her job with the State Government. In the given
circumstances, initially, she applied for leave as may be granted
to her under the service rules and finding that the same is not
possible she even resigned on 24.02.2020. The resignation was
kept pending for as good as seven months and the impugned
orders dated 25.09.2020 & 26.09.2020 were passed. Any
working woman, more particularly, a mother is required to be
accommodated as far as possible. Presuming the worst, it was
not possible for the department to grant any further leave to the
petitioner, including leave without pay. suffice would have been
in the given circumstances to accept the resignation of the
petitioner. This Court fails to understand what purpose is
achieved by the respondents by keeping the petitioner in service
from 24.02.2020 i.e. from the date of resignation onwards.
During the said period, they could not appoint any other person
in place of the petitioner, therefore, the work of the college
continued to suffer and the public at large in no manner
benefited. The entire issue could have been best served by
accepting her resignation. The petitioner had a right to resign on
24.02.2020 and her resignation had to be accepted as till that
date neither any departmental inquiry was initiated against her
nor there was any other reason available to the respondents for
not accepting the resignation. Even her immediate superior
administrative authority, i.e., the principal of the college, had
recommended accepting her resignation from the service.
10. Learned Counsel for the petitioner has placed reliance upon
the judgment & order dated 08.03.2022 passed in Writ-A No.
4813 of 2021, Dr. Sonal Sachadev Aurora Vs. State of U.P. &
others.
11. Learned Standing Counsel also could not place any reason
for not accepting the resignation of the petitioner.
12. This Court finds that the case of the petitioner is squarely
covered by the judgment of Dr. Sonal Sachdeva (Supra). The
petitioner in the given facts and circumstances is treated
arbitrarily by the respondents. The respondents were bound to
accept the resignation of the petitioner and, there was no
necessity to conduct any inquiry against the petitioner.
13. In view of the aforesaid, the impugned orders dated
25.09.2020 & 26.09.2020 are hereby quashed. The respondents
shall treat the petitioner as having resigned from her post w.e.f.
24.02.2020 and shall grant her benefit which she is entitled to
by treating her to be in service till 24.02.2020. Such an exercise
shall be conducted expeditiously, say in not more than two
months from the date a copy of this order is placed before
respondent no.2, Director, Medical Education & Training, 6th
14. With the aforesaid, the writ petition is allowed.
