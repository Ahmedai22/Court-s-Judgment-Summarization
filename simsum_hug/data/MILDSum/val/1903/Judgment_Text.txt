This Criminal Petition under Section 482 of the Code of
Criminal Procedure, 1973 (for short “Cr.P.C.”) is filed seeking
quash of charge sheet in C.C.No.973 of 2020 on the file of the
Heard learned counsel for the petitioner and learned
Additional Public Prosecutor for the State.
The petitioner is A-4 in the above C.C.No.973 of 2020 on the
file of the learned VI Additional Junior Civil Judge, Guntur. He has
been facing prosecution for the offences punishable under Section
498A r/w 34 IPC and under Sections 3 and 4 of the Dowry
Learned counsel for the petitioner would submit that it is
stated in the F.I.R that the petitioner, who is A-4, only harassed
the de facto complainant by using harsh language against her. He
would submit that, however, it is stated in her Section 161 Cr.P.C
statement that the petitioner herein, who is A-4, also harassed her
along with along with other accused by making illegal demand for
additional dowry. Therefore, he would submit that this is a
deliberate improvement made in her Section 161 Cr.P.C statement,
which was not stated in the F.I.R. So, he would submit that this is
a false case foisted against him and thereby prayed for quash of
the said charge sheet against the petitioner.
The aforesaid ground urged by the petitioner is not a valid
legal ground for quash of the charge sheet. No doubt, it is only
stated in the F.I.R that the petitioner harassed the de facto
complainant by using harsh language against her and that
subsequently she stated in her Section 161 Cr.P.C statement that
the petitioner also harassed the de facto complainant along with
other accused by demanding additional dowry from her. Whether
the subsequent statement given by her in her Section 161 Cr.P.C
statement is an improvement made subsequently or not and
whether the said evidence is true or not is the matter relating to
appreciation of evidence by the trial Court in the final adjudication
of the case. This Court in a petition filed under Section 482 Cr.P.C
cannot appreciate the evidence on record in exercise of its inherent
powers. Since the ground that was urged by the petitioner pertains
to appreciation of evidence of the witnesses, it cannot be a valid
legal ground for quash of the charge sheet. Therefore, the Criminal
Petition is devoid of merit.
Resultantly, the Criminal Petition is dismissed.
Miscellaneous petitions, if any pending, in the Criminal
Petition, shall stand closed.
