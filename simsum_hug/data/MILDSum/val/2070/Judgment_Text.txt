One B.H.Veeresh submitted the RTI application seeking
information in respect of Objection in Para 39 of Draft Audit
Report of the Officers of the Executive Engineer conducted by
the Chief Audit Officer, BBMP, Bangalore during 2011-12 and
certain other information. The details of the information sought
are in Annexure-B. The office of the Chief Engineer transferred
the said application to the Executive Engineer, Road and
Information Officer of the Executive Engineer (Roads and
Infrastructure), Mahadevapura, Special Zone, BBMP issued a
WP No. 22745 of 2018
letter to the applicant stating that the audit report for the year
2011-12 was not received by his office.
The   applicant    preferred    an    appeal    before  the
Superintendent Engineer, Road and Infrastructure, BBMP,
Bangalore and the same was dropped since the applicant did
not prosecute the same diligently. The applicant filed an
appeal/ complaint under Section 19(3) of the RTI Act before the
Karnataka Information Commission. The Commission issued
notice by fixing the date of hearing on 27.01.2016. One
Smt.Padmavathi, Account Superintendent appeared on behalf
of the PIO and the Commission directed the PIO to provide the
applicant free of cost information. It is said that on 01.02.2016,
the PIO & Executive Engineer (R&I) BBMP, Bangalore provided
the available information (for 789 pages) to the applicant
through his assignee Maheswar Singh and the same was
acknowledged by the assignee of the applicant.
However, on 03.06.2016, the Commission directed to pay
Rs.1,000/- (Rupees One Thousand only) as compensation to
the applicant and directed to provide information free of cost on
or before 16.09.2016.
It is also averred that the applicant disputed the said
information and stated that he has not received the complete
information. It is also averred that at this juncture the
petitioner was the PIO to Executive Engineer, Mahadevapura
Zone, BBMP and no notice was served to him however, the
notice was served on the petitioner only on 24.01.2017 through
the BBMP officer. In the meantime, the then PIOs were dropped
from the proceedings by the Commission. On 28.12.2016, the
Commission issued a notice to the petitioner and the petitioner
submitted a report that a payment of Rs.1,000/- (Rupees One
Thousand only) is made to the applicant. The petitioner also
submitted the explanation to drop the proceedings against him
since he was transferred to another department and the
information sought by the applicant was furnished and payment
of Rs.1,000/- (Rupees One Thousand only) was also made. But,
the Commission vide order dated 18.01.2008 imposed a
penalty of Rs.10,000/-     (Rupees Ten Thousand only) on the
Under these circumstances, the petitioner having left with
no other alternative and efficacious remedy, has filed this Writ
Petition under Articles 226 and 227 of the Constitution of India.
WP No. 22745 of 2018
3.    Learned counsel for the petitioner and respondent
No.1 have urged several contentions.
4.    Heard, the contentions urged on behalf of the
respective parties and perused the Writ papers and also the
Annexures with utmost care.
Sri.Kashinath.,    learned    counsel    for   petitioner in
presenting his argument submitted that the Commission has
not accorded any opportunity to the petitioner and hence there
is an utter violation of the principles of natural justice.
Sri.Rajashekhar.K., learned counsel appearing on behalf
of the Commission raised many pleas and justified the action of
The first argument in the present case is about the
violation of the principles of natural justice and the second is
about the arbitrary exercise of power by the commission.
The principle of Audi alterem partem is the basic concept
of the principle of natural justice. The omnipotence inherent in
the doctrine is that no one should be condemned unheard.
WP No. 22745 of 2018
It is needless to say that whenever a public function is
being performed there is an inference, in the absence of an
express requirement to the contrary, that the function is
required to be performed fairly. The inference will be more
compelling in the case of any decision which may adversely
affect a person’s rights or interests or when a person has a
legitimate expectation of being fairly treated. The significance
of this approach is that it prima facie imposes on all
administrators     an   obligation   to    act    fairly.  Without
acknowledging      this   expressly,   the     majority    of  the
decisions/orders of the public authorities are in practice no
more     than  conscious   or unconscious    illustrations  of the
Reverting to the facts of the case, the petitioner gave a
detailed reply on 11.01.2018. The reply is in Annexure-N. A
perusal of the same shows that the petitioner has submitted
his explanation to drop the proceedings against him.
The order passed by the Commission imposing a penalty
is in Annexure-A. It is dated 18.01.2018. I have perused the
order with care. A perusal of the same depicts that the
WP No. 22745 of 2018
commission neither considered the written explanation nor
allowed the petitioner to submit his explanation orally. Hence,
I have no hesitation in saying that the commission has
disregarded the principles of natural justice. On this count
alone, the order is liable to be quashed.
Be that as it may, the petitioner was neither working as
an Information Officer when the application was filed nor was
he an information officer at the time of hearing of the appeal.
The petitioner was in the office of the Public Information
Officer and Executive Engineer Civil at Mahadevapura Special
Zone from 16.09.2016 to 22.05.2017 and thereafter he was
transferred to another place of BBMP. Hence, the imposition of
penalty on the petitioner is improper.
Further the available information was furnished to the
assignee of the applicant. The commission has failed to take
note of the fact that the petitioner was not in the office at the
relevant point in time. I may venture to say that the
Commission     has     failed   to   have    regard  to   relevant
considerations   and    disregarded    relevant  matters.  In  my
WP No. 22745 of 2018
considered opinion, the order passed by the commission is
unsustainable in law.
The result is that the Writ Petition will be allowed. This
Court orders a Writ of Certiorari. The order dated 18.01.2018
passed by the Commission in No. PÀªÀiÁD 459 ¹MJA 2015 vide
Annexure- A is quashed.
Resultantly, the Writ Petition is allowed.
