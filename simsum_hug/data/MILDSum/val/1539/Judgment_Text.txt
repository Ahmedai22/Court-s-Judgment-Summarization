This petition is filed by the petitioner-accused No.2
under Section 482 of Cr.P.C. for quashing the criminal
proceedings in C.C. No.340/2021 (old C.C. No.234/2020)
pending on the file of Principal Civil Judge (Sr. Dn.) and
CJM Court, Chennagiri, for the offences punishable under
Sections 20(a)(i), 20(b)(ii)(A) of the Narcotic Drugs And
Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985 (hereinafter referred to
as 'NDPS Act') registered by Basavapatna Police Station,
2.  Heard the arguments of learned counsel for the
petitioner and the learned High Court Government Pleader
for the respondent-State.
3. The case of prosecution is that on the suo moto
complaint by the respondent-police on 21.03.2019, the
case was registered.     It is alleged that when the police
officer Devaraj T.V. was in the CEN Police Station, he got
credible information that some persons selling ganja in the
jurisdiction of Basavapatna police station. Immediately, he
recorded first information and registered FIR against
unknown      person   and   he    along  with police  staff,
apprehended the accused Nos.1 and 2.            When they
searched the accused, they found that the accused were in
possession of 750 grams of Ganja and the same was
seized under the panchanama in the presence of panchas.
After investigation, charge sheet came to be filed against
the accused persons, which is under challenge.
4. Learned counsel for the petitioner has contended
that as per the seizure panchanama, the seized material is
not ganja, which has only leaves and seeds totally 750
grams, therefore, it does not fall under the definition of
Section 2(iii)(b) of NDPS Act. The seized material cannot
be considered as ganja in order to bring under the
provisions of the NDPS Act.        Therefore, prayed for
quashing the criminal proceedings.       In support of his
arguments, the learned counsel for the petitioner has
relied upon the judgment of Mehaboob Daula @ Daula
and others Vs. The State of Karnataka and another
passed in Criminal Petition No.8192/2016 decided on
5.   Per contra, learned High Court Government
Pleader appearing for respondent No.1 State objected the
petition and contended that the ganja contains leaves,
fruiting tops, seeds, stems and it cannot be bifurcated at
the time of seizure and therefore, it is contended that,
even if the leaves are removed, the quantity of Ganja will
come down and therefore, that itself is not a ground to
quash the criminal proceedings. The matter is under trial.
Hence, prayed for dismissing the petition.
6. Having heard the learned counsel for the parties,
perused the records.
7.  The main contention of the learned counsel for
the petitioner is that the seized ganja of 750 grams is
containing the leaves and seeds which is not considered as
ganja as per the provisions of Section 2(iii) (b) of the
NDPS Act.     In order to verify the same, it is worth to
mention the provisions of Section 2(iii)(b) of the NDPS Act.
Section 2(iii)(b) : Cannabis (hemp) means
GANJA, that is, the flowering or fruiting tops
of the cannabis plant (excluding the seeds
and leaves when not accompanied by the
tops), by whatever name they may be known
8.  If we read the definition, ganja which excludes
the seeds and leaves, contains flowering or fruiting tops of
cannabis   plant.  In   the complaint     especially  seizure
panchanama, which reveals that the bag in possession of
the petitioner looked like a leaf, but it contained the
flower, fruiting top, leaves and seeds.      Considering the
same, it not only contains the seeds and leaves, but also
accompanying the flowering and fruiting tops. Therefore,
the material seized is containing flowering and fruiting tops
accompanying the seeds and leaves which amounts to
Ganja i.e., the leave and seed accompanied with flowering
or fruiting tops of the cannabis plant. It falls under ganja.
The    conclusion   is  only  the  leaves   and   seeds   not
accompanied, then it cannot be considered as ganja. In
order to exclude the definition of ganja, the seeds and
leaves shall not accompany the tops and fruits.
9.   That apart, the opinion of FSL indicates the
positive of ganja. The trial Court has also examined three
witnesses.    Considering the facts, the contention of the
petitioner that the seized quantity of ganja will not fall
under the definition of ganja under Section 2(iii) (b) of the
NDPS Act, cannot be acceptable.
10.   In this regard, the Hon'ble Supreme Court in
case of HIRA SINGH AND ANOTHER VS. UNION OF
INDIA AND ANOTHER reported in (2020) 20 SCC 272,
at para 12.1 and 12.2, has observed as under:
"12.1. The decision of this Court in E.
Micheal Raj taking the view that in the mixture of
narcotic drugs or psychotropic substance with one
or more neutral substance(s), the quantity of the
neutral substance(s) is not to be taken into
consideration while determining the small quantity
or commercial quantity of a narcotic drug or
psychotropic substance and only the actual content
by weight of the offending narcotic drug which is
relevant for the purpose of determining whether it
would constitute small quantity or commercial
quantity, is not a good law.
12.2. In case of seizure of mixture of narcotic
drugs or psychotropic substances with one or more
neutral  substance(s),    the quantity  of  neutral
substance(s) is not to be excluded and to be taken
into consideration along with actual content by
weight of the offending drug, while determining the
“small or commercial quantity” of the narcotic
drugs or psychotropic substances."
11.   Therefore, considering the above, I am of the
view that for determining the weight of ganja, to bring
under the small or medium or commercial quantity, it
cannot be bifurcated by removing seeds and leaves and it
cannot be a ground for quashing the criminal proceedings,
when the FSL report was issued stating that the result of
chemical analysis is positive of the ganja. Therefore, even
for the purpose of considering the bail application, if the
commercial quantity of ganja is seized, the accused cannot
plead to bring under the medium quantity claiming that it
is not a commercial quantity by excluding the seeds and
leaves as per the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court
of Hira Singh's case, stated supra.     Therefore, it is not a
ground for quashing the criminal proceedings stating that
seized material is not that of ganja. Hence, the contention
of  the  petitioner  is not    sustainable  under    law  and
therefore, I hold that the contents of seized material is
ganja, that includes fruiting tops, flower accompanying the
seeds and leaves. Therefore, the petition deserves to be
Accordingly, the criminal petition dismissed.
