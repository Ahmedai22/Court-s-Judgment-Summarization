station. Earlier, the Investigating Officer had completed the investigation
up to Parcha No.5. She had requested the district authorities for approval
of the gang chart against the accused-respondent, however, the District

18. On 10.06.2004, an additional Parcha No.8 was completed by P.W.-

from the District Jailer's office to give the list of persons, who had come
to visit the jail on 27.04.2003. On this request, information was given
that no application or name was mentioned of the person(s) who came to

Parcha No.9 and went to District Jail and met Deputy Jailer S.P. Singh
and Jailer R.C. Gupta, and their statements were recorded. She tried to

chief of Jailer, S.K. Awasthi, aged around 61, was recorded on
12.12.2003, and he was not cross examined by the accused and right to

Lucknow District Jail in 2002-03. Complete information including entry
of any visitor inside the jail was made in the jail book. He denied the
suggestion that it was not necessary to mention name of the visitor who
would meet which prisoner, and only number of persons coming to meet
the prisoner was mentioned. He clarified that the visitor would give an
application in which he would write name of the prisoner whom he
would like to meet. However, it was not necessary to get the signature of
the visitor made on gate register. He also accepted the suggestion that as
per the Jail Manual, only three persons can be allowed to meet a
prisoner in a day, and only twice a prisoner can meet the visitors in a
week. Any visitor coming to meet a prisoner is frisked and thereafter he
comes inside. Frisking is done outside the gate as well as inside the gate.
When incident took place he was in the office, the accused-respondent
came in the office and he protested. The witness said, "I had stopped
visitors coming to meet him, he became angry and went out of the
office." Thereafter, the witness remained sitting in the office. He further
said that the fact of showing weapon and threats of killing him were
heard by him but he did not see from his own eyes. These facts were
told to him by staff and, thereafter, he got the FIR registered. FIR was
registered as per his own wisdom. Whatever information regarding the
incident was recorded by him, he informed his higher officials and then
lodged the FIR.
21. He further deposed that it was prohibited to take mobile and firearm
inside the jail. No person could have a firearm inside the jail as only
after frisking, prisoners were sent inside the jail. Routine checking
would also take place inside the jail. He also said that FIR was
registered after consultation with the higher officials. He denied the
suggestion that under pressure of the Government, he lodged the false
FIR. He accepted the suggestion that he did not see weapon in the
hands of Mukhtar Ansari and he did not extend treats to anyone before
him, and he also did not abuse the witness on the said date. Mukhtar
Ansari did not create deterrence/disturbance in performing the official
duties by him.
22. P.W.-7, Inspector Ganesh Singh, deposed that on 28.04.2003 he was
posted as S.S.I. in Alambagh Police Station. He conducted the
investigation of the Case Crime No.131 of 2003 under Sections 353,
504, 506 IPC. He received the copy of the FIR to conduct the

23. In his cross examination, he said that he carried out the investigation
outside the jail and inside the jail. He denied suggestion that he
completed the investigation sitting in the police station. He also said that
he denied the suggestion that provisions of the Gangsters Act were
added under the pressure of higher authorities. District Magistrate did

was not sent to the circle officer. He denied the suggestion that he
carried out the investigation under the pressure of higher authorities. He
also denied the suggestion that he used to receive call from a Minister
for filing of charge-sheet, and he also denied the suggestion that he
prepared the charge-sheet under the political pressure. He also denied
the suggestion that he was coming to give evidence after 17 years under
the pressure of higher officials.
24. In his statement recorded under Section 313 Cr.P.C. the accused-
respondent denied the incident and said that no hot talk between him and
Jailer took place on the date of incident and for this reason, Gatekeeper,
Prem Chandra Maurya did not hear anything. He further said that the
complainant, S.K. Awasthi had given false evidence regarding the fact
that when the incident took place, his entire staff including two Deputy
Jailers, Sarvendra Vikram Singh and Shailendra Pratap Singh were
present. He denied that the Warden allowed the visitors inside the Jail
under his fear and terror. In respect of statement of P.W.-3, Shailendra
Pratap Singh that while he was sitting in the office some hot talk had
taken place between S.K. Awasthi and Mukhtar Ansari, and when he
went to the office of the Jailer he found accused going out of the office
and S.K. Awasthi was sitting in his office, he denied the incident. He
also denied the statement regarding the version given by other witnesses
and said that the investigation was conducted under political pressure to
falsely implicate him. He said that he had been M.L.A. for 5 terms from
different political parties. He defeated the candidates of different
political parties. He was quite popular in the constituency and he was
falsely implicated in the case.
25. Learned Trial Court after considering the evidence and submissions
on behalf of the prosecution and the defence vide impugned judgment
and order held that from the evidence, offences under Sections 504, 506
did not get proved against the accused-respondent nor the offence under
Section 353 IPC was made out and, therefore, learned Trial Court
acquitted the accused.
26.    Mr. U.C. Verma, learned Additional Government Advocate
appearing for the State-appellant assisted by Mr.Rao Narendra Singh,
learned A.G.A. has submitted that place of incident, presence of the
complainant and witnesses are not in dispute. Alleged incident had taken
place inside the jail. The accused-respondent is biggest bahubali of the
State, facing several dozens of cases of heinous offences. Accused-
respondent's name strikes fear and terror in the hearts and minds of
general public, and even in the Government officials. Mr.R.K. Tiwari
earlier Jailer was killed in a cold blooded manner in a broad day light
near Governor House, Lucknow allegedly on behest of the accused-
respondent and other accused as he was enforcing the rules and
regulation of jail which was causing hindrance in carrying out illegal
and criminal activities of the accused-respondent from Jail in organized
manner. These accused, however, could secure acquittal as witnesses
turned hostile which is a pattern in all cases where the accused-
respondent had secured acquittal.
27. This Court recently while rejecting Criminal Misc. Bail Application
No.46494 of 2021 of the accused-respondent in a case registered as Case
Crime No.185 of 2021 under Sections 419, 420, 467, 468, 471, 120B
IPC, Police Station Sarai Lakhansi, District Mau vide order dated
30.06.2020 while rejecting the bail of the accused-respondent, has held
"4. The applicant deserves no introduction in the State of U.P. on account
of his alleged ''Robin Hood' image in Hindi speaking States of India. He is
the harden and habitual offender, who is in sphere of crime since 1986 but
surprisingly, he has managed not a single conviction against him. It is
indeed astounding and more amusing angle of the issue, that a person
having more than 50+ criminal cases to his credit of various varieties, has
managed his affairs in such a way that he has not received a single
conviction order against him. Infact it is slur and challenge to the judicial
system that such a dreaded and ''White Collored' criminal in the field of
crime undefeated and unabetted."
28. This Court has noted the long criminal history of the accused-
respondent in the aforesaid judgment which is reproduced as under:-
"Cases registered at Gazipur
7. 236/20 468, 471, 120B IPC & Section 3 of Damages of Public Property
Case registered at District Chandauli
7. 55/21 3(1) of U.P.Gangster Act Dakshin Tola
8. 4/20 30 Arms Act and Sections 419, 420, 467, 468, 471, 120 B IPC
Cases registered at New Delhi
29. This Court also commented about the criminals like the accused-
respondent being elected by the public as their representative for six
consecutive terms in following words:-
"26. The above mentioned is a rich criminal horoscope of the applicant on
which the applicant can boast and claim himself to be a popular public
figure, who was elected as MLA for the six consecutive time. As mentioned
above, this is a most unfortunate and ugly face of our democracy where a
person on one hand facing almost two dozen Sessions Trials and on the
other hand the public is electing him as their representative for six
consecutive times. It is really uphill task to adjudicate, as to whether he is
really a popular public figure? Or his nuisance value, which are giving
30. Mr. U.C. Verma has submitted that the incident is dated 27.04.2003.
The accused-respondent did not allow trial to proceed until he was sure
of turning the witnesses hostile. Most of the witnesses got retired when
they turned up for examination in the Court. He has submitted that trial
court start only in July, 2013.
31. Mr. U.C. Verma has further submitted that the accused-respondent
used to enjoy high status and privileges inside the jail and, therefore,
would carry out his organized criminal activities from the jail including
killing of the people for exhortation, political opponents and officials,
who he thought were coming in his way of his crime world or they could
challenge him politically or otherwise. He used to treat jail as his seat of
power where his people could come and meet him freely at any time
even carrying arms without any hindrance or obstacle by jail officials.
Mr. S.K. Awasthi, the complainant, P.W.-2 tried to regulate visitors
according to Jail Book and Jail Manual, and this could not be tolerated
by the accused-respondent. He has further submitted that there was no
enmity between the complainant and accused-respondent Mukhtar
Ansari for his false implication. He has further submitted that P.W.-2,
who was the complainant, his examination was completed on
12.12.2003, the accused did not cross examine on that day and the right
of cross examination was closed. The witnesses got retired soon
thereafter and after his retirement when he was won over for fear and
terror of the accused-respondent, an application came to be filed under
Section 311 Cr.P.C. to recall the said witness, and vide order dated
30.01.2014, the witness was recalled. He has submitted that the said
witness in his examination-in-chief has fully supported the prosecution
case in all respects and evidence given in cross-examination after he was
won over, was because of fear and terror as after retirement there would
be concern for his security and security of his family. Even P.W.-3 has
supported the prosecution case and deposed that the dispute took place
between the accused-respondent and the complainant in respect of
visitors coming to meet the accused-respondent-Mukhtar Ansari and hot
talk between the accused-respondent and the complainant. He saw the
complainant coming out of the office of the complainant.
32. P.W.-6, second Investigating Officer, Smt. Indu Srivastava who
completed the investigation had said that her staff was not willing to
give evidence against the accused-respondent. P.W.-7, who conducted
the final investigation, has also supported the prosecution case. She
further said that there was no application and record of visitors who had
come to meet the accused-respondent. This would mean that the
accused-respondent wanted to the visitors to meet him without any
formality. Mr.U.C. Verma, learned A.G.A. for the appellant-State has,
therefore, submitted that the offence under Sections 353, 504, 506 IPC
are proved on the basis of evidence of prosecution, and the trial Court
erred in acquitting the accused-respondent. He has further submitted that
even if there is contradiction in the evidence of P.W.-2 given in
examination-in-chief and cross examination, it is for the Court to
separate wheat from the chaff and find out of the truth. Statement in
examination-in-chief has equal value as of cross examination. Even
from the evidence of P.W.-3, and P.W.-6 charges against the accused-
respondent for offence under Sections 504, 506, 353 IPC are clearly
proved and the appeal is liable to be allowed.
33. On the other hand, Mr. Jyotindra Mishra, learned Senior Advocate
assisted by Mr. Satendra Kumar (Singh), Advocate appearing for the
accused-respondent has submitted that evidence of none of the witnesses
is cogent and credible. P.W.-1, P.W.-4, P.W.-5 did not support the
prosecution case either in their examination-in-chief or cross
examination. P.W.-2 supported the prosecution case in his examination-
in-chief he did not support the prosecution case in his cross examination.
Evidence of P.W.-6 and P.W.-7 independently are not enough to prove
the prosecution case as they are the formal witnesses, who conducted the
investigation. He, therefore, has submitted that the Trial Court after
considering the evidence brought by the prosecution did not find the
prosecution case proved against the accused-respondent. From the
evidence available on record, it cannot be said that the prosecution was
able to prove case against the accused-respondent beyond reasonable
doubt, and there is no error in the impugned judgment and order passed
by learned Trial Court. He has, therefore, submitted that the appeal is
without any merit and substance and is liable to be dismissed.
34. Mr. Jyotindra Mishra, learned Senior Advocate has further submitted
that in case of appeal against acquittal, the appellate court is required to
consider whether the view taken by the Trial Court is possible one or
not. If the view of the Trial Court is possible one, then acquittal should
not be set aside by merely substituting its reason. He in support of the
aforesaid submission has placed reliance on the judgment of in the case
of Dhanapal vs State by Public Prosecutor, Madras: (2009) 10 SCC
401 wherein the Supreme Court has culled out the principal for dealing
the judgment of acquittal of trial Court by appellate Court in para 39
"39. The following principles emerge from the cases above:
1. The accused is presumed to be innocent until proven guilty. The accused
possessed this presumption when he was before the trial court. The trial
court's acquittal bolsters the presumption that he is innocent.
2. The power of reviewing evidence is wide and the appellate court can
reappreciate the entire evidence on record. It can review the trial court's
conclusion with respect to both facts and law, but the appellate court must
give due weight and consideration to the decision of the trial court.
3. The appellate court should always keep in mind that the trial court had
the distinct advantage of watching the demeanour of the witnesses. The
trial court is in a better position to evaluate the credibility of the
witnesses.
4. The appellate court may only overrule or otherwise disturb the trial
court's acquittal if it has “very substantial and compelling reasons” for
doing so.
5. If two reasonable or possible views can be reached—one that leads to
acquittal, the other to conviction—the High Courts/appellate courts must
rule in favour of the accused."
35. Mr.Jyotindra Mishra, learned Senior Advocate has further submitted
that in appeal against acquittal under Section 378/386 Cr.P.C. the
appellate Court should not likely to interfere with the judgment of
acquittal, even if the appellate Court believes that there is some evidence
pointing finger towards the accused. In support of the said submission,
he has placed reliance on the judgments in the cases of State of
Rajasthan vs Naresh @ Ram Naresh: (2009) 9 SCC 368 and State of
Uttar Pradesh vs Banne @ Baijnath & Ors: (2009) 4 SCC 271.
36. Mr.Jyotindra Mishra, learned Senior Advocate has further submitted
that in criminal jurisprudence there is presumption of innocence until the
guilt is proved beyond reasonable doubt. If an accused is acquitted in the
trial, presumption of innocence gets re-enforced, and the appellate court
in exercise of appellate jurisdiction under Section 378/386 Cr.P.C.
should reverse an acquittal only when it has "very substantial and
compelling reasons." For the aforesaid submission, learned Senior
Advocate has placed reliance on the judgment of the Supreme Court in
the case of Ghurey Lal vs State of Uttar Pradesh : (2008) 10 SCC
37. It has also been submitted that if the view taken by the Trial Court is
not perverse or impossible view, the High Court should not interfere
with the order of acquittal. Para 17 of the judgment in the case of
Samghaji Hariba Patil vs State of Karnataka (2006) 10 SCC 494 has
been placed on service by the learned Senior Advocate which reads as
"17. We have noticed hereinbefore that the High Court has taken a
contrary view. Had the High Court been the first court, probably its view
could have been upheld, but it was dealing with a judgment of acquittal.
We have taken notice of the depositions of the main prosecution witnesses
only to show that the view of the learned trial Judge cannot be said to be
perverse or the same was not possible to be taken. While dealing with a
case of acquittal, it is well known, the High Court shall not ordinarily
overturn a judgment if two views are possible. The appellant had no axe to
grind. The prosecution had not proved that he had any motive. He was
only said to be the friend of Accused 1. If the accused had gone there with
six others to assault the deceased and his family members, it is unlikely
that the appellant would take with him for the said purpose, a hammer to
an agricultural field. The hammer is not ordinarily used for agricultural
operations. Even if we assume that Accused 1 had been nurturing any
grudge against the deceased, it is unlikely that the appellant would be
involved therein."
38. I have considered the facts, circumstances, evidence and
submissions of the learned counsels for the appellant-State and accused-
39. Section 353 IPC defines assault or criminal force to deter public
servant from discharge of his duties as under:-
"353. Assault or criminal force to deter public servant from discharge of
his duty.—Whoever assaults or uses criminal force to any person being a
public servant in the execution of his duty as such public servant, or with
intent to prevent or deter that person from discharging his duty as such
public servant, or in consequence of anything done or attempted to be
done by such person in the lawful discharge of his duty as such public
servant, shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a
term which may extend to two years, or with fine, or with both.
If an accused uses criminal force against a public servant with an
intention to prevent him or deter that public servant from discharging his
duty as public servant then, he would commit offence under Section 353
IPC, he may be punished for said offence up to 2 years or with fine or with
both."
40. Criminal intimidation is defined under Section 503 IPC which reads
"503. Criminal intimidation.—Whoever threatens another with any injury
to his person, reputation or property, or to the person or reputation of any
one in whom that person is interested, with intent to cause alarm to that
person, or to cause that person to do any act which he is not legally bound
to do, or to omit to do any act which that person is legally entitled to do,
as the means of avoiding the execution of such threat, commits criminal
intimidation. Explanation.—A threat to injure the reputation of any
deceased person in whom the person threatened is interested, is within this
section. Illustration A, for the purpose of inducing B to desist from
prosecuting a civil suit, threatens to burn B’s house. A is guilty of criminal
intimidation."
41. Punishment for criminal intimidation is provided under Section 506
IPC which reads as under:-
"506. Punishment for criminal intimidation.—Whoever commits, the
offence of criminal intimidation shall be punished with imprisonment of
either description for a term which may extend to two years, or with fine,
or with both; If threat be to cause death or grievous hurt, etc.—And if the
threat be to cause death or grievous hurt, or to cause the destruction of
any property by fire, or to cause an offence punishable with death or
1[imprisonment for life], or with imprisonment for a term which may
extend to seven years, or to impute, unchastity to a woman, shall be
punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may
extend to seven years, or with fine, or with both.
By State amendment in Uttar Pradesh, it is provided that punishment
for offence under Section 506 IPC is imprisonment of 7 years or fine,
or both. Offence is cognizable and non bailable.
42. Intentional insult with intent to provoke breach of the peace is
defined under Section 504 IPC which reads as under:-
504. Intentional insult with intent to provoke breach of the peace.
—Whoever intentionally insults, and thereby gives provocation to
any person, intending or knowing it to be likely that such provocation
will cause him to break the public peace, or to commit any other
offence, shall be punished with imprisonment of either description
for a term which may extend to two years, or with fine, or with both.
43.    Facts of the case regarding place of incident, presence of the
accused at the place of incident, presence of the complainant and the
witnesses of fact are not in dispute. Date and time of the incident are not
in dispute. The accused-respondent has reputation of most dreaded
criminal and mafia don who had more than 60 cases of heinous offences
to his credit as mentioned earlier. No one can dispute his credibility of
striking terror and fear in minds and heart of the people including the
Government officials. Mr. U.C. Verma, learned Additional Government
Advocate has submitted that the accused-respondent used to have free
run even inside the jail and he had been carrying on his criminal
activities in an organized manner from the jail. During his incarceration
in the jail, he had committed several heinous offences including
elimination of his political rivals, kidnapping/abduction, usurping
private and public properties, amassing wealth and properties from
proceeds of crime. Even inside the jail, his people would come to meet
him without any hindrance created by any jail staff. The warden opened
the gate and allowed the people who had come to meet the accused-
respondent out of fear and terror of the accused without due permission.
He has submitted that in most of the cases the witnesses had turned
hostile, and he secured acquittal. This fact cannot be disputed for which
this Court has taken judicial notice as mentioned earlier.
44. Jailer, Mr. S.K. Awasthi, the complainant, P.W.-2 did not have any
enmity with the accused-respondent, Mukhtar Ansari but it appears that
he was trying to enforce rules inside the jail and, therefore, ordered that
no visitor should be allowed to meet the prisoners unless permission is
granted. P.W.-2, in his examination-in-chief, had said that the accused-
respondent got highly enraged by the very fact that the Jailer was not
allowing visitors who had come to meet the accused-respondent inside
the jail without permission. He took out a revolver from one of the
visitors who have been allowed inside the jail by Jail Warden. He also
extended verbal threats of killing the Jail Warden. Interestingly, the said
witness was not cross examined on 12.12.2003 when his examination-
in-chief took place. I find substance in the submission of Mr. U.C.
Verma, learned A.G.A. that after he was won over, an application came
to be filed to recall the said witness which was allowed by the learned
Trial Court vide order dated 30.01.2014, and then witness to some extent
did not support the prosecution case in his cross examination.
45.     The evidence given in the examination-in-chief does not get
completely obliterated, if the witnesses in his cross examination turns
hostile or does not support his evidence given in examination-in-chief.
Evidence of witness who has supported the prosecution case in
examination-in-chief does not get effaced or washed off the record
altogether. In such a situation, it is the duty of the Court to examine the
evidence carefully and find that part of evidence which can be accepted
and be acted upon.
46. The Supreme Court in the case of Dayaram and another vs State
of Madhya Pradesh: (2020) 13 SCC 382 while dealing with hostile
witnesses in paras 10.4 to 10.7 has held as under:-
"10.4 ..............From their examination-in-chief it is evident that the
deceased was conscious and, in a state to lodge the FIR. In their cross-
examination, these witnesses denied having any knowledge about the
persons who attacked the deceased. They were declared hostile during
their cross-examination. The testimony, prior to cross-examination can be
relied upon.
10.5. Reliance is placed on the decisions of this Court in Bhagwan Singh
v. State of Haryana [Bhagwan Singh v. State of Haryana, (1976) 1 SCC
389 : 1976 SCC (Cri) 7] , Rabindra Kumar Dey v. State of Orissa
[Rabindra Kumar Dey v. State of Orissa, (1976) 4 SCC 233 : 1976 SCC
(Cri) 566] and Syad Akbar v. State of Karnataka [Syad Akbar v. State of
Karnataka, (1980) 1 SCC 30 : 1980 SCC (Cri) 59] , wherein it has been
held that the evidence of a prosecution witness cannot be rejected in toto,
merely because the prosecution witnesses turned hostile. The evidence of
such witnesses cannot be treated as effaced or washed off the record
altogether but the same can be accepted to the extent that their version is
found to be dependable on careful scrutiny.
10.6. This Court in Khujji v. State of M.P. [Khujji v. State of M.P., (1991) 3
SCC 627 : 1991 SCC (Cri) 916] , in para 6 of the judgment held that:
“6. … The evidence of PW 3 Kishan Lal and PW 4 Ramesh came to be
rejected by the trial court because they were declared hostile to the
prosecution by the learned Public Prosecutor as they refused to
identify the appellant and his companions in the dock as the assailants
of the deceased. But the counsel for the State is right when he submits
that the evidence of a witness, declared hostile, is not wholly effaced
from the record and the part of the evidence which is otherwise
acceptable can be acted upon.”
10.7. This position in law was reiterated in Vinod Kumar v. State of
Punjab [Vinod Kumar v. State of Punjab, (2015) 3 SCC 220 : (2015) 2
SCC (Cri) 226 : (2015) 1 SCC (L&S) 712] , wherein the Court held that:
“31. The next aspect which requires to be adverted to is whether testimony
of a hostile witness that has come on record should be relied upon or not.
Mr Jain, learned Senior Counsel for the appellant would contend that as
PW 7 has totally resiled in his cross-examination, his evidence is to be
discarded in toto. On a perusal of the testimony of the said witness, it is
evincible that in examination-in-chief, he has supported the prosecution
story in entirety and in the cross-examination, he has taken the path of
prevarication. In Bhagwan Singh v. State of Haryana [Bhagwan Singh v.
State of Haryana, (1976) 1 SCC 389 : 1976 SCC (Cri) 7] , it has been laid
down that even if a witness is characterised as a hostile witness, his
evidence is not completely effaced. The said evidence remains admissible
in the trial and there is no legal bar to base a conviction upon his
testimony, if corroborated by other reliable evidence.”
47. There is no legal bar for conviction upon the testimony of hostile
witness, given in examination-in-chief, if it is corroborated by other
reliable evidence.
48. The Supreme Court in the case of Ramesh & Ors vs State of
Haryana: (2017) 1 SCC 529 has held that evidence of a hostile witness
cannot be totally rejected but requires its closest scrutiny and portion of
evidence which is consistent with the case of the prosecution or defence
may be accepted. The Supreme Court has noted the disturbing
phenomenon almost a regular feature that in criminal cases witnesses
turn hostile for various reasons. One of the reasons is status of the
accused. Para 39 of the said judgment reads as under:-
"39. We find that it is becoming a common phenomenon, almost a regular
feature, that in criminal cases witnesses turn hostile. There could be
various reasons for this behaviour or attitude of the witnesses. It is
possible that when the statements of such witnesses were recorded under
Section 161 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 by the police during
investigation, the investigating officer forced them to make such
statements and, therefore, they resiled therefrom while deposing in the
court and justifiably so. However, this is no longer the reason in most of
the cases. This trend of witnesses turning hostile is due to various other
factors. It may be fear of deposing against the accused/delinquent or
political pressure or pressure of other family members or other such
sociological factors. It is also possible that witnesses are corrupted with
monetary considerations."
49.    The Supreme Court has noted earlier judgments wherein such
peculiar behavior of witnesses turning hostile, has been commented
upon in paras 40 to 44. The Supreme Court culled out the reasons which
can be discerned for retracting their statements before the Court and
turning hostile. It would be apt to reproduced paras 40-44 of the
judgment in Ramesh (supra):-
"40. In some of the judgments in past few years, this Court has commented
upon such peculiar behaviour of witnesses turning hostile and we would
like to quote from few such judgments. In Krishna Mochi v. State of Bihar
[Krishna Mochi v. State of Bihar, (2002) 6 SCC 81 : 2002 SCC (Cri)
1220] , this Court observed as under : (SCC p. 104, para 31)
“31. It is a matter of common experience that in recent times there has
been a sharp decline of ethical values in public life even in developed
countries much less developing one, like ours, where the ratio of
decline is higher. Even in ordinary cases, witnesses are not inclined to
depose or their evidence is not found to be credible by courts for
manifold reasons. One of the reasons may be that they do not have
courage to depose against an accused because of threats to their life,
more so when the offenders are habitual criminals or high-ups in the
Government or close to powers, which may be political, economic or
other powers including muscle power.”
41. Likewise, in Zahira Habibullah Sheikh (5) v. State of Gujarat [Zahira
Habibullah Sheikh (5) v. State of Gujarat, (2006) 3 SCC 374 : (2006) 2
SCC (Cri) 8] , this Court highlighted the problem with the following
observations : (SCC pp. 396-98, paras 40-41)
“40. “Witnesses” as Bentham said:“are the eyes and ears of justice”.
Hence, the importance and primacy of the quality of trial process. If
the witness himself is incapacitated from acting as eyes and ears of
justice, the trial gets putrefied and paralysed, and it no longer can
constitute a fair trial. The incapacitation may be due to several
factors, like the witness being not in a position for reasons beyond
control to speak the truth in the court or due to negligence or
ignorance or some corrupt collusion. Time has become ripe to act on
account of numerous experiences faced by the court on account of
frequent turning of witnesses as hostile, either due to threats, coercion,
lures and monetary considerations at the instance of those in power,
their henchmen and hirelings, political clouts and patronage and
innumerable other corrupt practices ingeniously adopted to smother
and stifle truth and realities coming out to surface.… Broader public
and societal interests require that the victims of the crime who are not
ordinarily parties to prosecution and the interests of the State
represented by their prosecuting agencies do not suffer.… There comes
the need for protecting the witness. Time has come when serious and
undiluted thoughts are to be bestowed for protecting witnesses so that
the ultimate truth presented before the court and justice triumphs and
that the trial is not reduced to a mockery. …
41. The State has a definite role to play in protecting the witnesses, to
start with at least in sensitive cases involving those in power, who have
political patronage and could wield muscle and money power, to avert
trial getting tainted and derailed and truth becoming a casualty. As a
protector of its citizens it has to ensure that during a trial in court the
witness could safely depose the truth without any fear of being haunted
by those against whom he had deposed. Every State has a
constitutional obligation and duty to protect the life and liberty of its
citizens. That is the fundamental requirement for observance of the
rule of law. There cannot be any deviation from this requirement
because of any extraneous factors like caste, creed, religion, political
belief or ideology. Every State is supposed to know these fundamental
requirements and this needs no retaliation (sic repetition). We can only
say this with regard to the criticism levelled against the State of
Gujarat. Some legislative enactments like the Terrorist and Disruptive
Activities (Prevention) Act, 1987 (in short “the TADA Act”) have taken
note of the reluctance shown by witnesses to depose against people
with muscle power, money power or political power which has become
the order of the day. If ultimately truth is to be arrived at, the eyes and
ears of justice have to be protected so that the interests of justice do
not get incapacitated in the sense of making the proceedings before the
courts mere mock trials as are usually seen in movies.”
42. Likewise, in Sakshi v. Union of India [Sakshi v. Union of India, (2004)
5 SCC 518 : 2004 SCC (Cri) 1645] , the menace of witnesses turning
hostile was again described in the following words : (SCC pp. 544-45,
para 32) “32. The mere sight of the accused may induce an element of
extreme fear in the mind of the victim or the witnesses or can put them in a
state of shock. In such a situation he or she may not be able to give full
details of the incident which may result in miscarriage of justice.
Therefore, a screen or some such arrangement can be made where the
victim or witnesses do not have to undergo the trauma of seeing the body
or the face of the accused. Often the questions put in cross-examination
are purposely designed to embarrass or confuse the victims of rape and
child abuse. The object is that out of the feeling of shame or
embarrassment, the victim may not speak out or give details of certain
acts committed by the accused. It will, therefore, be better if the questions
to be put by the accused in cross-examination are given in writing to the
presiding officer of the court, who may put the same to the victim or
witnesses in a language which is not embarrassing. There can hardly be
any objection to the other suggestion given by the petitioner that whenever
a child or victim of rape is required to give testimony, sufficient breaks
should be given as and when required. The provisions of sub-section (2) of
Section 327 CrPC should also apply in inquiry or trial of offences under
Sections 354 and 377 IPC.”
43. In State v. Sanjeev Nanda [State v. Sanjeev Nanda, (2012) 8 SCC 450 :
(2012) 4 SCC (Civ) 487 : (2012) 3 SCC (Civ) 899] , the Court felt
constrained in reiterating the growing disturbing trend : (SCC pp. 486-87,
“99. Witness turning hostile is a major disturbing factor faced by the
criminal courts in India. Reasons are many for the witnesses turning
hostile, but of late, we see, especially in high profile cases, there is a
regularity in the witnesses turning hostile, either due to monetary
consideration or by other tempting offers which undermine the entire
criminal justice system and people carry the impression that the mighty
and powerful can always get away from the clutches of law, thereby
eroding people's faith in the system.
100. This Court in State of U.P. v. Ramesh Prasad Misra [State of U.P.
v. Ramesh Prasad Misra, (1996) 10 SCC 360 : 1996 SCC (Cri) 1278]
held that it is equally settled law that the evidence of a hostile witness
could not be totally rejected, if spoken in favour of the prosecution or
the accused, but it can be subjected to closest scrutiny and that portion
of the evidence which is consistent with the case of the prosecution or
defence may be accepted. In K. Anbazhagan v. Supt. of Police [K.
Anbazhagan v. Supt. of Police, (2004) 3 SCC 767 : 2004 SCC (Cri)
882] , this Court held that if a court finds that in the process the credit
of the witness has not been completely shaken, he may after reading
and considering the evidence of the witness as a whole, with due
caution, accept, in the light of the evidence on the record that part of
his testimony which it finds to be creditworthy and act upon it. This is
exactly what was done in the instant case by both the trial court and
the High Court [Sanjeev Nanda v. State, 2009 SCC OnLine Del 2039 :
(2009) 160 DLT 775] and they found the accused guilty.
101. We cannot, however, close our eyes to the disturbing fact in the
instant case where even the injured witness, who was present on the
spot, turned hostile. This Court in Manu Sharma v. State (NCT of
Delhi) [Manu Sharma v. State (NCT of Delhi), (2010) 6 SCC 1 : (2010)
2 SCC (Cri) 1385] and in Zahira Habibullah Sheikh (5) v. State of
Gujarat [Zahira Habibullah Sheikh (5) v. State of Gujarat, (2006) 3
SCC 374 : (2006) 2 SCC (Cri) 8] had highlighted the glaring defects
in the system like non-recording of the statements correctly by the
police and the retraction of the statements by the prosecution witness
due to intimidation, inducement and other methods of manipulation.
Courts, however, cannot shut their eyes to the reality. If a witness
becomes hostile to subvert the judicial process, the court shall not
stand as a mute spectator and every effort should be made to bring
home the truth. Criminal judicial system cannot be overturned by those
gullible witnesses who act under pressure, inducement or intimidation.
Further, Section 193 IPC imposes punishment for giving false evidence
but is seldom invoked.”
44. On the analysis of various cases, the following reasons can be
discerned which make witnesses retracting their statements before the
court and turning hostile:
(iii) Use of muscle and money power by the accused.
(iv) Use of stock witnesses.
(vi) Hassles faced by the witnesses during investigation and trial.
(vii) Non-existence of any clear-cut legislation to check hostility of
witness."
50. Had P.W.-1 been examined on the same day in all likelihood, he
would have supported the prosecution case as he did in his examination-
in-chief. The accused-respondent deliberately did not cross examine the
said witness on the said date and after the said witness was won over, an
application came to be filed under Section 311 Cr.P.C. to recall the said
witness and said application was allowed vide order dated 30.01.2014
and in the cross-examination he deviated from the prosecution case to
some extent.
51. Criminal case is built on edifice of evidence which is admissible in
law. The Supreme Court noted in Swaran Singh vs State of Punjab:
(2000) 5 SCC 668 that criminal cases can be adjourned again and again
till the witness get tired or gives up. Adjournments are taken till the
witness is no more or is tired. This result in miscarriage of justice. The
witness is not treated with respect in the Court. Para 36 of the aforesaid
judgment reads as under:-
"36. A criminal case is built on the edifice of evidence, evidence that is
admissible in law. For that, witnesses are required whether it is direct
evidence or circumstantial evidence. Here are the witnesses who are a
harassed lot. A witness in a criminal trial may come from a far-off place to
find the case adjourned. He has to come to the court many times and at
what cost to his own self and his family is not difficult to fathom. It has
become more or less a fashion to have a criminal case adjourned again
and again till the witness tires and gives up. It is the game of unscrupulous
lawyers to get adjournments for one excuse or the other till a witness is
won over or is tired. Not only is a witness threatened, he is abducted, he is
maimed, he is done away with, or even bribed. There is no protection for
him. In adjourning the matter without any valid cause a court unwittingly
becomes party to miscarriage of justice. A witness is then not treated with
respect in the court. He is pushed out from the crowded courtroom by the
peon. He waits for the whole day and then he finds that the matter is
adjourned. He has no place to sit and no place even to have a glass of
water. And when he does appear in court, he is subjected to unchecked
and prolonged examination and cross-examination and finds himself in a
hapless situation. For all these reasons and others a person abhors
becoming a witness. It is the administration of justice that suffers. Then
appropriate diet money for a witness is a far cry. Here again the process
of harassment starts and he decides not to get the diet money at all. High
Courts have to be vigilant in these matters. Proper diet money must be
paid immediately to the witness (not only when he is examined but for
every adjourned hearing) and even sent to him and he should not be left to
be harassed by the subordinate staff. If the criminal justice system is to be
put on a proper pedestal, the system cannot be left in the hands of
unscrupulous lawyers and the sluggish State machinery. Each trial should
be properly monitored. Time has come that all the courts, district courts,
subordinate courts are linked to the High Court with a computer and a
proper check is made on the adjournments and recording of evidence. The
Bar Council of India and the State Bar Councils must play their part and
lend their support to put the criminal system back on its trail. Perjury has
also become a way of life in the law courts. A trial Judge knows that the
witness is telling a lie and is going back on his previous statement, yet he
does not wish to punish him or even file a complaint against him. He is
required to sign the complaint himself which deters him from filing the
complaint. Perhaps law needs amendment to clause (b) of Section 340(3)
of the Code of Criminal Procedure in this respect as the High Court can
direct any officer to file a complaint. To get rid of the evil of perjury, the
court should resort to the use of the provisions of law as contained in
Chapter XXVI of the Code of Criminal Procedure."
52. The Supreme Court in para 7 of the Radha Mohan Singh @ Lal
Saheb vs State of U.P. : (2006) 2 SCC 450 has held as under:-
"7. It is well settled that while hearing an appeal under Article 136 of the
Constitution, this Court will normally not enter into reappraisal or review
of evidence unless the trial court or the High Court is shown to have
committed an error of law or procedure and the conclusions arrived at are
perverse. The Court may interfere where on proved facts wrong inference
of law is shown to have been drawn. (See Duli Chand v. Delhi Admn.
[(1975) 4 SCC 649 : 1975 SCC (Cri) 663] , Dalbir Kaur v. State of Punjab
v. State of Gujarat [(2000) 1 SCC 358 : 2000 SCC (Cri) 113] and
Chandra Bihari Gautam v. State of Bihar [(2002) 9 SCC 208 : 2003 SCC
(Cri) 1178 : JT (2002) 4 SC 62] .) Though the legal position is quite clear
still we have gone through the evidence on record in order to examine
whether the findings recorded against the appellants suffer from any
infirmity. The testimony of PW 1 Ganesh Singh, who is an injured witness,
and PW 4 Ramji Singh clearly establish the guilt of the accused.
According to the case of the prosecution the incident took place shortly
after sunset. The eyewitnesses have deposed that after the incident the
deceased Hira Singh was carried on a cot to the “bandh”, which is on the
outskirts of the village. As no conveyance was available, the first
informant had to wait for quite some time and thereafter a tempo was
arranged on which the deceased was taken to the district hospital where
he was medically examined by PW 2 Dr. Siddiqui at 9.00 p.m. It has come
in evidence that the village is at a distance of six miles from Police Station
Kotwali, Ballia. The non-availability of any conveyance is quite natural as
it was Holi festival. Even PW 3 Mohan Yadav fully supported the
prosecution case in his examination-in-chief. In his cross-examination,
which was recorded on the same date, he gave details of the weapons
being carried by each of the accused and also the specific role played by
them in assaulting the deceased and other injured persons. As his cross-
examination could not be completed it was resumed on the next day and
then he gave a statement that he could not see the incident on account of
darkness. His testimony has been carefully examined by the learned
Sessions Judge and also by two learned Judges of the High Court
(Hon'ble K.K. Mishra, J. and Hon'ble U.S. Tripathi, J.) and they have held
that the witness, on account of pressure exerted upon him by the accused,
tried to support them in his cross-examination on the next day. It has been
further held that the statement of the witness, as recorded on the first day
including his cross-examination, was truthful and reliable. It is well
settled that the evidence of a prosecution witness cannot be rejected in
toto merely because the prosecution chose to treat him as hostile and
cross-examined him. The evidence of such witness cannot be treated as
effaced or washed off the record altogether but the same can be accepted
to the extent his version is found to be dependable on a careful scrutiny
thereof. (See Bhagwan Singh v. State of Haryana [(1976) 1 SCC 389 :
1976 SCC (Cri) 7 : AIR 1976 SC 202] , Rabindra Kumar Dey v. State of
Syad Akbar v. State of Karnataka [(1980) 1 SCC 30 : 1980 SCC (Cri) 59 :
AIR 1979 SC 1848] and Khujji v. State of M.P. [(1991) 3 SCC 627 : 1991
SCC (Cri) 916 : AIR 1991 SC 1853] ) The evidence on record clearly
shows that the FIR of the incident was promptly lodged and the testimony
of PW 1 Ganesh Singh, PW 4 Ramji Singh and also PW 3 Mohan Yadav
finds complete corroboration from the medical evidence on record. We
find absolutely no reason to take a different view."
53. From the aforesaid discussion, it can be seen that law is very clear
that appellant court lightly should not interfere with the judgment and
order of acquittal unless the said judgment is perverse or the view taken
by the learned Trial Court is impossible view. It is also well settled that
testimony of hostile witness does not get effaced completely and washed
off record but it is for the Court to closely scrutinize the testimony of
such witness in the facts and circumstances of the cases and take into
consideration while convicting or acquitting the accused that part of the
testimony of such witness which supports the prosecution case and can
be relied on for convicting the accused.
54. Witness P.W.-2, who was given threats of life by pointing a revolver
by the accused-respondent, has fully supported the prosecution case in
all respects in his examination-in-chief. His testimony in his
examination-in-chief is fully in tune with the prosecution case. The said
witness did not have any enmity with the accused-respondent, and there
was no reason to falsely implicate the accused-respondent for
commission of the offence for which the accused-respondent was
charged. There is no reason to disbelieve his testimony given in
examination-in-chief. His testimony in his cross examination which
takes place after he could have been won over does not appear to be
credible. The submission of Mr. U.C. Verma, learned Additional
Government Advocate, cannot be brushed aside that the application for
his re-examination came to be filed after said witness was won over for
threat or some other reasons. If the testimony of the such witness is read
together with the testimony of P.W.-3, P.W.-6 and P.W.-7, charges
against the accused-respondent for committing offences under Sections
504, 506, 353 IPC are proved beyond reasonable doubt.
55. Trial Court had completely ignored the evidence of P.W.-2 given in
examination-in-chief and had only considered his cross examination.
The approach of the trial Court is palpably erroneous and against the
well settled legal position as discussed above. The impugned judgment
and order passed by the learned Trial court is unsustainable.
56. Admittedly, the complainant was posted as Jailer in the District Jail,
Lucknow on the date of incident. He was present in his office when the
alleged incident took place. He was discharging public/official duty on
the date, time and place of the incident. From the evidence brought on
record, it is proved that the accused-respondent used criminal force by
pointing pistol towards him with intent to prevent and deter the
complainant from discharging his duty as a Jailer, therefore, offence
under Section 353 IPC is clearly proved against the accused-respondent
and he is convicted for committing the said offence.
57.   From evidence on record, it is also proved that the accused-
respondent abused the complainant and insulted him knowing fully well
that it would undermine the authority of the Jailer and would cause
breach of peace inside the jail and outside inasmuch as if a public
servant can be humiliated and abused, then authority of public
functionary would get diminished and people would not respect the
lawful authority. Therefore, the accused-respondent is found guilty for
committing the offence under Section 504 IPC.
58. From evidence on record, it is proved that the accused-respondent
on the date, time and place of incident took pistol/revolver from a visitor
and pointed towards the complainant and threatened him for his life. He
is found guilty for committing offence under Section 506 IPC. He
intimidated the complainant who as a Jailer was performing public duty
by abusing him and pointing revolver/pistol towards him and threatened
to kill him. It would have invoked excitement inside the jail likely to
create breach of peace, tumult and disorder inside the jail in discharge of
public duties by the jail staff.
59. In view of the foregoing discussion, present appeal is allowed.
