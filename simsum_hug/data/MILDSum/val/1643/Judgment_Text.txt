1.      The two Writ Petitions assail an order dated 8th February
2022 of the Maharashtra Administrative Tribunal. The impugned
order dealt with a number of Original Applications. The Applicants
were candidates who appeared for an examination conducted by the
Maharashtra Public Service Commission(“MPSC”). The challenge
before the MAT was to the decision of the MPSC in deleting three
questions Nos. 17, 27 and 90. The prayer was that MPSC be
directed not to delete these questions but to allocate the marks to
these applicants on the base of their answers.
2.      To appreciate the controversy, it is necessary to note that the
MPSC pattern gives one mark for a correct answer and deducts 0.25
marks for an incorrect answer. The MPSC issued an advertisement
on 28th February 2020 for a Group – B combined examination for
the post of Police Sub Inspector, Sales Tax Inspector and Assistants
in Mantralaya. The preliminary examination was conducted on 4th
September 2021. Nearly three lakh candidates appeared. MPSC
published its first answer key on 7th September 2021, and, following
its usual practice, solicited objections to this first answer key. In all,
4686 objections came in to MPSC in regard to 60 of the 100
questions in the examination paper. MPSC forwarded these
objections to various experts. Questions 23 and 43 were cancelled
but these are not in dispute in the present Writ Petition. The same
questions were also in paper sets B, C and D and were also cancelled
accordingly. The answer keys to questions 87 and 90 were changed
by MPSC and MPSC then issued a revised answer key on 17th
November 2021. This second answer key also came in for criticism.
It is at this stage that MPSC referred disputed questions Nos. 17, 27
and 90 to experts.
3.      We straight away turn to these three contentious questions in
the examination paper. They are part of the impugned order.
“17. Which of the following is the best quality iron ore?
“27. Observe the following statements:
a.      Verul caves is in Aurangabad district.
b.      Chambhar caves is in Pune district.
c.      Chikhaldars hill station is in Raigad district.
d.      Gautala National Park is in Jalgaon district.
Which of the above statement is/are correct?
(1) Only a statement                (2) Only b and c
Statements are correct.     Statements are correct.
Answer key : (3) Only a and d statements are correct.
“90. The Indian Space Organization(ISRO) will launch
an unmanned campaign in December, 2020.
Answer key : (1) Gangayaan”
4.      Question 17, on a reference to texts, received conflicting
answers and part of the difficulty was the difference between saying
that one of the four options is “finest” as opposed to “best”. This is
obviously a matter of perception and how one chooses to read the
descriptor. There is, as the MAT noted, a difference between the
best and the finest — a distinction we see all too often at our own
Bar. This conflict being noted MPSC decided to cancel the
question.
5.      Question 90 was also found to be incorrectly framed because
the date was wrong. The date should have been November 2020
and not December 2020, and, in any case, because of the Covid
pandemic only one space craft was ever launched so there was no
question of a multiple choice. That question was correctly therefore
deleted.
6.      The controversial aspect is question 27, and it is only this
that counsel for the Petitioners press before us. The MPSC’s
answer key was that statements (a) and (d) were correct namely that
the “Verul caves are in Aurangabad district” and that “the Gautala
National Park is in Jalgaon district”. Experts differed, and therefore
the MPSC deleted the question itself. There is no controversy that
answer (a) is indeed correct. But Gautala is not a National Park at
all. It is a designated Wildlife Sanctuary, one that has a distinct
statutory status under the provisions of the Wildlife Protection Act
1972. Very different considerations apply to a Wildlife sanctuary as
compared to those applicable to a National Park. Equally
importantly, the Guatala Wildlife sanctuary is not in Jalgaon district
alone. It straddles the Jalgaon and Aurangabad districts.
7.      As it happens, these Writ Petitioners managed to get the
correct answer to a wrongly framed question. They selected (a) as
being the only correct answer. This is probably a matter of chance.
8.      We consider it from two perspectives. There would have been
candidates who selected both (a) and (d) as the answer to question
27 and this would have been in consonance with MPSC’s published
answer key. But that answer was wrong because option (d) itself was
wrong. Option (d) could not therefore be allowed to continue in the
manner in which it stood, and this left only options (a), (b) and (c).
These Petitioners chose option (a). But the request to the MAT to
undelete the MPSC deletion would have had the effect of
completely unbalancing the entire equation.
9.      As a result of these deletions, the total number of questions
was reduced from 100 to 95. What the request of the Petitioner’s
essentially amounts to is that for them there should be 96th question
on which they should receive one additional point. We do not see
how that can be done. An introduction of a 96th question would
undoubtedly result in negative marks being assigned to very many
other candidates, none of whom are before this Court, and none of
whom were before the MPSC. Equally, it is not possible to say that
for other candidates the examination should be of 95 questions, but
for these Writ Petitioners alone it should be treated as being of 96
questions.
10.     The request by counsel for the Petitioners in both Petitions
that the matter be referred to an expert is entirely without
substance. No expertise is required in a matter that is plainly of fixed
geography. The limits of the Gautala Wildlife Sanctuary are known,
declared and notified. Its status as a Wildlife Sanctuary (and not as a
National Park) is also a matter of statutory recognition. That the
limits of the Gautala Wildlife Sanctuary cover parts of both Jalgaon
and Aurangabad districts cannot be disputed. No question arises,
therefore, of inviting the opinion of any other expert.
11.     Once we view it like this, i.e., that questions 17 and 90 were
correctly deleted and that question 27 had to be deleted to balance
competing equities and interests, then there is no substance
whatsoever to these Petitions.
12.     Mr Dere for the Petitioners invites our attention to the
decision of the Supreme Court in Ran Vijay Singh and Others v State
of Uttar Pradesh & Ors.1 His reliance on paragraph 14 of this decision
is inapposite. That paragraph only notes the litigation history that
brought the matter to the Supreme Court. But as Mr Kulkarni for
MPSC points out, the principles of law and the decision’s ratio are
set out in paragraphs 30, 31 and 32. Indeed paragraph 30 itself
makes it clear that what follows is the pronouncement of the Ran
Vijay Singh Court on law. We reproduce those three paragraphs.
“30. The law on the subject is therefore, quite clear and
we only propose to highlight a few significant conclusions.
30.1. If a statue, Rule or Regulation governing an
examination permits the re-evaluation of an answer sheet or
scrutiny of an answer sheet as a matter of right, then the
authority conducting the examination may permit it;
30.2. If a statue, Rule or Regulation governing an
examination does not permit re-evaluation or scrutiny of an
answer sheet(as distinct from prohibiting it) then the court
may permit re-evaluation or scrutiny only if it is
demonstrated very clearly, without any “inferential process
of reasoning or by a process of rationalisation” and only in
rare or exceptional cases that a material error has been
30.3. The court should not at all re-evaluate or scrutinize
the answer sheets of a candidate—it has no expertise in the
matter and academic matters are best left to academics;
30.4. The court should presume the correctness of the
key answers and proceed on that assumption; and
30.5. In the event of a doubt, the benefit should go to the
examination authority rather than to the candidate.
31.     On our part we may add that sympathy or
compassion does not play any role in the matter of
directing or not directing re-evaluation of an answer
sheet. If an error is committed by the examination
authority, the complete body of candidates suffers. The
entire examination process does not deserve to be
derailed only because some candidates are disappointed
or dissatisfied or perceive some injustice having been
caused to them by an erroneous question or an
erroneous answer. All candidates suffer equally, though
some might suffer more but that cannot be helped since
mathematical precision is not always possible. This
Court has shown one way out of an impasse — exclude the
suspect or offending question.
32.     It is rather unfortunate that despite several
decisions of this Court, some of which have been
discussed above, there is interference by the courts in
the result of examinations. This places the examination
authorities in an unenviable position where they are
under scrutiny and not the candidates. Additionally, a
massive and sometimes prolonged examination exercise
concludes with an air of uncertainty. While there is no
doubt that candidates put in a tremendous effort in
preparing for an examination, it must not be forgotten
that even the examination authorities put in equally
great efforts to successfully conduct an examination.
The enormity of the task might reveal some lapse at a
later stage, but the court must consider the internal
checks and balances put in place by the examination
authorities before interfering with the efforts put in by
the candidates who have successfully participated in the
examination and the examination authorities. The
present appeals are a classic example of the consequence of
such interference where there is no finality to the result of
the examinations even after a lapse of eight years. Apart
from the examination authorities even the candidates are
left wondering about the certainty or otherwise of the result
of the examination – whether they have passed or not;
whether their result will be approved or disapproved by
court; whether they will get admission in a college or
university or not; and whether they will get recruited or not.
This unsatisfactory situation does not work to anybody’s
advantage and such a state of uncertainty results in
confusion being worse confounded. The overall and large
impact of all this is that public interest suffers.”
13.     As the emphasized portion shows, the Petitioners cannot
claim the benefit of doubt. They cannot rely on, let alone invoke
sympathy or compassion. They have no legally enforceable right to
canvas in a writ petition. The reason is provided in paragraph 31 that
judicial interference does not only affect the Petitioners, as we have
noted, but affects the complete body of candidates. The entire
examination process is derailed. This is why the Ran Vijay Singh
Court deprecated the practice of interference by Courts in the
results of examinations.
14.     What is suggested to us is that the Petitioners be allowed to sit
for the main examination on 11th September 2022, but that their
results be withheld subject to the outcome of these Writ Petitions.
Other than delaying the inevitable, we do not see what purpose
would be achieved by that. In any case, since we are disposing of
these petitions finally, no question of making such an order arises.
15.     Indeed, we would venture to suggest that except in the most
exceptional circumstances, there should not be such interim
interventions by a Court for the simple reason that allowing the
benefit to even a single candidate (let alone 250) irredeemably alters
the balance in regard to the other candidates who have managed to
cross the qualifying threshold criteria. There will be questions of
seniority in ranking or of the correctness of the numerical listing
that will then ensue. Those adversely affected by such Writ Petitions
will have to be heard. They are not even parties to this Writ Petition.
16.     Indeed, in Ran Vijay Singh itself we note the observations of
the Supreme Court as to the limits of the High Court’s jurisdiction
even under Article 226 of the Constitution of India. In paragraphs
33 and 34 the Supreme Court in Ran Vijay Singh, the Supreme
“33. The facts of the case before us indicate that in
the first instance the learned Single Judge took it upon
himself to actually ascertain the correctness of the key
answers to seven questions. This was completely
beyond his jurisdiction and as decided by this Court on
several occasions, the exercise carried out was
impermissible. Fortunately, the Division Bench did not
repeat the error but in a sense, endorsed the view of
the learned Single Judge, by not considering the
decisions of this Court but sending four key answers
for consideration by a one-man Expert Committee.
34. Having come to the conclusion that the High
Court(the learned Single Judge as well as the Division
Bench) ought to have been far more circumspect in
interfering and deciding on the correctness of the key
answers, the situation today is that there is a third
evaluation of the answer sheets and a third set of results is
now ready for declaration. Given this scenario, the options
before us are to nullify the entire re-evaluation process
and depend on the result declared on 14-9-2010 or to go
by the third set of results. Cancelling the examination is
not an option. Whichever option is chosen, there will be
some candidates who are likely to suffer and lose their jobs
while some might be entitled to consideration for
employment.”
17.     The MAT considered the factual background and as the rival
submissions, including a great deal of learning that was cited before
it. In paragraph 19, MAT noted that the MPSC had deleted the
question 27 and this could not be faulted. The observation of the
MAT in paragraph 22 are indeed interesting. (Pages 80, 81 of the
Writ Petition No. 8575 of 2022). The MAT said this:
“22. It is to be noted that unequal treatment given to
the candidates appearing for the examination and
unequal treatment given to the Questions are two
different things. The M.P.S.C. has corrected the answer
key of Question No. 87 after considering experts opinion
that the correct answer was available. This decision was
taken by the M.P.S.C. because there was no dispute in the
opinion expressed in respect of Question No. 87. However,
in respect of Question No. 27 the opinion given by the
experts were conflicting. Therefore, the treatment given
to Question No. 87 and Question No. 27 and their
Answer Keys is different. But this will not in any case
lead to discrimination or violation of Article 14 or
Article 16 of the Constitution so far as Applicants are
concerned. The Applicants cannot claim legal right
against the decision of the M.P.S.C. because the
decision taken is applicable uniformly to all the
candidates who appeared for the examination. We
understand the plight of the Applicants that they have
lost the marks, however, in examinations chance is often
a determinant.”
18.     We believe this approach is completely correct. What is being
canvassed before us is precisely the opposite: viz., that the
Petitioners should be given preferential treatment and the uniform
applicability of the MPSC deletion decision should not made
applicable to the Petitioners. That is a submission that only needs to
be stated to be rejected.
19.     Finally, the MAT considered the question of the power of the
MPSC and again held on the basis of cogent material that the MPSC
had the power to take an appropriate decision.
20.     It is impossible to render a decision in favour of these
Petitioners, whether interim or final, without adversely affecting the
very many of candidates who have been able to meet the qualifying
criteria and are eligible to sit for the main examination on 11th
September 2022. There is no principle under which an exception
can be carved out for these Petitioners. Even basic notions of equity
and justice would not permit such a preferential treatment.
21.     Finally, we remind ourselves that although styled as Writ
Petitions assailing the MAT order, what we are really being asked to
do is to undertake a judicial review of an administrative action, i.e.,
the decision of the MPSC to delete some questions. But that
presents a hurdle of its own for these Petitioners, for then we are
concerned only with the decision-making process, not the decision
itself. If that be so, and it is not shown to us how MPSC’s decision-
making process is at all vulnerable, there can be no question of
interference.
22.     We find no infirmity in the impugned decision of the MPSC
nor the impugned order of the MAT. The MAT’s order is, to our
mind, closely reasoned and balances perfectly the competing
equities.
23.     In parting, we note with great disapproval that Suraj Sanjay
Pawar has somehow managed to be a petitioner in two different
petitions. He is the 2nd Petitioner in Writ Petition No 8575 of 2022,
in which Mr Dere appears for all the Petitioners. Pawar has also filed
Writ Petition No 10092 of 2022, where he is separately represented
by Mr Udane. Pawar has done so without any leave of the Court. Mr
Udane says that Pawar’s independent second petition has a wider
challenge (to the deletion of all three Questions Nos 17, 27 and 90),
though the earlier Writ Petition No. 8575 of 2022 (where Mr Dere
appears) is one in which the argument is confined to Question No
27. Having joined Mr Dere’s other clients in Writ Petition No. 8575
of 2022, Pawar could not have filed another petition of his own, at
least not without leave of the court. He cannot be represented as a
petitioner by two separate advocates, effectively canvassing in one
Petition only a limited point and then trying to expand it in another
petition. In any case, there is no merit at all in the challenge to the
deletion of Questions Nos 17 and 90, for the reasons already noted.
24.     We find no merit in these Petitions and no reason to interfere
with the impugned order of the MAT.
26.     In the facts and circumstances of the case, there will be no
order as to costs.
