For the Respondents          : Mr. R. N. Sahay, Senior Advocate
11/05.01.2022          Heard Mr. Ajit Kumar, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the
petitioner.
2.      Heard Mr. R. N. Sahay, Senior Advocate along with Mr.
Yashvardhan, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the respondents.
3.      The present writ petition has been filed challenging the order of
termination dated 12.01.2010 passed by the respondent no. 6 and a
further relief has been sought to reinstate the petitioner with all back
wages. It has been pointed out by the learned counsel for the petitioner
that the appellate authority had dismissed the appeal filed by the
petitioner vide order dated 26.06.2010 as contained in Annexure- 9 of the
writ petition, but due to inadvertence, the same was not challenged in the
writ petition. Accordingly, one interlocutory application being I.A. No.
1452 of 2021 was filed challenging the appellate order also. The I.A. was
allowed and the interlocutory application was taken to be a part of the
writ petition for future reference.
4.     The learned counsel for the petitioner submits that accordingly the
order of termination dated 12.01.2010 as well as appellate order dated
26.06.2010 are under challenge in this writ petition.
5.     The learned counsel for the petitioner submits that the petitioner
was earlier charge-sheeted vide letter dated 03.09.2007 on account of
absence     from     duty    with   effect  from    24.07.2007     without
permission/information to the competent authority and upon enquiry the
same resulted in order of punishment dated 16.10.2007 and by the same
order the petitioner was permitted to resume his duty with effect from
18.10.2007. He submits that thereafter another show-cause was issued
vide memo no. 518 dated 02.06.2009 referring to earlier absenteeism
including absenteeism from 24.07.2007 and it was alleged that in spite of
permission granted to the petitioner to join duty with effect from
18.10.2007, the petitioner had not joined his duty. The learned counsel
submits that the impugned order dated 12.01.2010 refers to earlier
charge-sheet dated 03.09.2007 for which the petitioner was already
punished and accordingly, the impugned order of termination dated
12.01.2010 is a piece of complete non-application of judicial mind to the
charges levelled against the petitioner vide memo No. 518 dated
6.     The learned counsel for the petitioner has submitted that there was
sufficient reason for not resuming his duty with effect from 18.10.2007
as the petitioner had given application for joining on 06.12.2008 with a
medical certificate indicating that he was suffering from mental upset
from 12.10.2007 till 04.12.2008 and was sent for medical examination
on 03.03.2009 and was found fit for joining duty and thereafter he was
moving in the office of Respondent no. 5 and 6 but after three months
show cause dated 02.06.2009 was issued .
7.     The learned counsel for the petitioner also submits that the appeal
against the order of termination dated 12.01.2010 was also dismissed
vide another impugned order dated 26.06.2010. He submits that the
appellate order is a non-speaking order.
8.     The learned counsel submits that in view of the aforesaid
submissions both the impugned orders are fit to be quashed and set-aside
and the petitioner be reinstated in service with all back wages. The
learned counsel has relied upon a judgement passed by this Court in
W.P.(S) No. 5522 of 2007 decided on 23.12.2021 to submit that it has
been held that a statutory appeal must be decided on merits by reasoned
9.      The learned counsel appearing on behalf of the respondents, on
the other hand, has opposed the prayer and has submitted that absence of
the petitioner without intimation to the authority is an admitted fact.
Although the petitioner has not annexed the enquiry report, but the same
has been annexed along with the counter-affidavit, which reflects that
charges are admitted. He submits that in spite of repeated opportunities
granted to the petitioner to mend his ways the petitioner has been in the
habit of absenting himself from duty. The learned counsel has referred to
a chart in the counter affidavit reflecting only 76 days attendance in the
year 2004 and 49 days attendance in the year 2006 and the petitioner
remained absent on rest of the days during 2004 to 2009 with nil
attendance in the year 2005, 2007, 2008 and 2009. He further submits
that the impugned order dated 12.01.2010 not only refers to the charge-
sheet dated 03.09.2007 and the inquiry report dated 07.09.2007, but also
the inquiry conducted pursuant to letter no. 580 dated 17.06.2009 which
is pursuant to the present charge-sheet dated 02.06.2009. He submits that
the impugned order reflects application of mind and in view of the
admission of the allegation made against the petitioner, the impugned
order of termination does not call for any interference.
10.     The learned counsel for the respondents has also referred to the
second show-cause dated 28.08.2009 which was issued to the petitioner
before imposing penalty on the basis of inquiry report. In response, the
petitioner has accepted the fact that he did not join his duty in spite of
direction to resume duty with effect from 18.10.2007 and has simply
stated that he had no idea that intimation regarding absence is required to
be given to the management. He has stated about his mental health
problem and that he was found medically fit on 03.03.2009 to join duty
but nothing has been stated as to what he did after 03.03.2009. After
considering the show cause, the impugned order dated 12.01.2010 was
11.    So far as the appellate order is concerned, the learned counsel
submits that the same also reflects application of mind and the appeal
filed by the petitioner has been annexed as Annexure-8 which indicates
that he has admitted his guilt and he had requested the authority to
pardon him and that he shall not repeat his mistake again.
12.    The learned counsel submits that the petitioner has already
attained the age of superannuation and considering the facts and
circumstances of this case, no interference is call for in writ jurisdiction.
He submits that the impugned orders are well reasoned orders
considering the facts and circumstances of this case when the allegation
of absence from duty as well as not resuming his duty with effect from
18.10.2007 stood admitted by the petitioner.
13.    In response, the learned counsel for the petitioner submits that
even if the petitioner has attained the age of superannuation, he would be
entitled to pension if the impugned orders are set-aside.
14.    From the perusal of the records of this case, it appears that a
show-cause was issued to the petitioner vide letter no. 518 dated
(1) You were absent from your duty 13.09.2003 and allowed on duty
(2) You were absent from duty on 24.9.2004 and allowed on duty
(3) You were absent from duty 20.4.2006 and allowed on duty
(4) You were absent from duty 24.7.2007 and allowed on duty w.e.f.
18.10.2007 with stoppage of one increment. But you have not joined
duty.”
15. In response, the petitioner submitted his show-cause and admitted
his absence from duty including the fact that he did not join duty with
effect from 18.10.2007. However, it was the specific case of the
petitioner that the petitioner was not well during the period from
19.10.2007 to 04.12.2008 due to mental ill health and he gave his joining
pursuant to which, vide letter dated 03.03.2009, the petitioner was sent
for examination by medical board and he was declared fit for joining
duty on 03.03.2009 and a copy of the same was submitted by him.
Thereafter certain letters were issued making enquiry about him and
subsequently, vide letter no. 518 dated 02.06.2009, the petitioner has
been charge-sheeted.
16.    The enquiry officer conducted the inquiry and submitted the
inquiry report as annexed with the counter-affidavit wherein a finding
has been recorded that the petitioner applied for duty on 15.06.2009, so
his actual absenteeism is from 19.10.2007 to 14.06.2009. The enquiry
officer also recorded that the charges levelled against the petitioner were
fully proved as he did not inform to the management at any point of time.
17.    Pursuant to the enquiry report, second show-cause was issued to
the petitioner vide letter no. 894 dated 28.08.2009 along with a copy of
the enquiry report asking him to explain as to why major penalty even
amounting to termination be not imposed upon him on the basis of
findings of the enquiry officer.
18.    The petitioner responded to the said show-cause and stated that
although the petitioner was declared fit for joining duty on 03.03.2009,
but no order was issued permitting him to join the duty. He also stated
that he had no knowledge that it is necessary for him to inform the
management for being absent from duty. The petitioner did not dispute
the findings of the enquiry officer in his show -cause reply. Rather, he
admitted the charges of repeated unauthorized absence from duty.
19.    The second show-cause reply of the petitioner was considered and
the impugned order dated 12.01.2010 was passed terminating the
petitioner with effect from 08.01.2010.
20.    Upon perusal of the impugned order dated 12.01.2010, this Court
finds that it refers to the enquiry which was conducted earlier pursuant to
show-cause dated 03.09.2007 and also refers to enquiry conducted by the
enquiry officer pursuant to letter no. 580 dated 17.06.2009. Vide letter
no. 580 dated 17.06.2009 enquiry committee was constituted to enquire
into the allegation levelled against the petitioner in show-cause letter no.
518 dated 02.06.2009 which is a subject matter of the present
proceedings. The concerned authority has accepted the findings of the
enquiry officer after having gone through the report of the inquiry officer
and imposed punishment of termination.
21.    This Court finds that the allegation levelled against the petitioner
vide letter no. 518 dated 02.06.2009 of not joining duty with effect from
18.10.2007 stood admitted by the petitioner and this aspect is not in
dispute even before this Court and the finding of the enquiry officer that
the petitioner remained absent from duty without any intimation to the
management, is also not in dispute and was never disputed by the
petitioner before the authorities. Even if the argument of the petitioner
that he was mentally unwell and was found medically fit to join duty on
03.03.2009 is taken into consideration, there is no material on record to
show any attempt on his part to join his duty. The petitioner has made a
statement for the first time in this writ petition that prior to issuance of
show cause dated 02.06.2009 he was moving in the office of the
Respondent no. 5 and 6 to give his joining but the enquiry officer has
given a finding that the petitioner applied for duty on 15.06.2009 which
was never disputed by the petitioner in reply to his second show-cause.
22.     Thus, the records of the case clearly indicate that the charges
which were levelled against the petitioner regarding past conduct of
unauthorized absence from duty including the charge of not joining his
duty with effect from 18.10.2007 stood admitted by the petitioner.
23.     Considering the aforesaid facts and circumstances of this case, the
argument of the petitioner that order dated 12.01.2010 is a non-speaking
order and that the same has been passed on the basis of earlier charge-
sheet, is devoid of any merit, hence rejected. On account of the aforesaid
reasons, this court is not inclined to interfere with the impugned order
24.     So far as the appeal is concerned, the letter by which the appeal
was filed has been annexed along with the counter-affidavit wherein the
petitioner again admitted his guilt and has simply prayed to take a
sympathetic view instead of dismissing the petitioner. No ground as such
challenging the order of termination dated 12.01.2010 was raised in the
appeal. The appellate authority, vide impugned order dated 26.06.2010,
dismissed the appeal and it has been communicated that the appeal
submitted by the petitioner was examined in detail and on perusal, the
appellate authority observed that under the facts and circumstances, it is
not at all expedient to interfere with the decision of the disciplinary
authority as there is no material for further consideration.
25.     This Court finds that the order of the appellate authority dated
26.06.2010 cannot be said to be a non-speaking order when seen in the
light of the appeal filed by the petitioner. In fact, even in the appeal, the
petitioner had admitted his guilt and had only prayed for a sympathetic
consideration and has stated that if he again commits such mistake, then
he may be terminated from service. The appellate order cannot be seen in
isolation and it has to be seen in the light of the grounds of appeal raised
by the petitioner. Since the petitioner did not raise any material ground
before the appellate authority, the impugned order of the appellate
authority dated 26.06.2010 cannot be said to be a non-speaking order.
26.    In the judgement relied upon by the petitioner passed in the case
W.P.(S) No. 5522 of 2007 dated 23.12.2021 the inquiry officer in the
said case had submitted a report in which he gave an opinion that the
charges were not fully proved, but the disciplinary authority awarded
punishment and the appeal against the order imposing punishment was
dismissed without considering the merits and by merely observing that
no ground was made out for interference.
27.    The present case stands on a different footing altogether as the
petitioner has admitted his guilt and the inquiry officer clearly held that
the petitioner remained absent without intimating to the authority and
had remained absent from duty from 19.10.2007 to 14.06.2009.
28.    In view of the aforesaid facts and circumstances, the aforesaid
judgement which has been relied upon by the petitioner does not apply to
the facts and circumstances of this case.
29.    As a cumulative effect of the aforesaid findings, the present
petition is hereby dismissed.
30.    Pending interlocutory application, if any, is closed.
