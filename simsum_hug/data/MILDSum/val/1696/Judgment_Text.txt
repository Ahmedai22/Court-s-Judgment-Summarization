The State of Maharashtra & Anr.                … Respondents
Mr. Rahul Kadam for the applicant.
Mr. R.M. Pethe, APP for respondent no.1/State
Ms. Anjali Patil for respondent no.2.
Mr. Ashish Kumar i/by ALJ & Partners for respondent
no.3.
1.       The applicant is challenging order dated 27th November,
2021 passed by the learned Metropolitan Magistrate, 64 th Court
Esplanade, Mumbai passed on an Application filed below Exhibit 7
in Criminal Case No.347/PW/2018.
2.      The applicant who has been informant filed an application
for intervention before the learned Magistrate. The applicant
sought audience before the decision in discharge application filed
by the accused. The said application has been contested by the
accused No.2 by filing reply stating that the applicant has no right
to file such application.
3.      The learned Magistrate rejected the application holding that
the applicant has not sought permission under sections 301 and
302 of the Code of Criminal Procedure,1973.
4.      On perusal of the application, the applicant in paragraph 6
and 7 stated as under :-
“6. The applicant states that if the discharge application is
heard and decided without giving audience to the first
informant/victim, the same would cause serious prejudice to
the rights of the first informant/victim.
7.      Even otherwise, if the discharge application comes to
be allowed, it would virtually be the end of the prosecution
and the same would amount to quashing of the entire
offense. Therefore, in such a situation, it is mandatory to
give audience to the informant/victim as per law laid down
by the Supreme Court and by the Bombay High Court.”
5.      On perusal of clauses 6 and 7, in my opinion, the said
averments constitute seeking permission under Section 302 of the
Code of Criminal Procedure Code, 1973.
6.      The reliance placed on judgment of Single Judge of the High
Court in Criminal Writ Petition No. 3705 of 2018 (Prakash
C. Sheth v. The State of Maharashtra & Anr.) decided on 14th
February 2020 is concerned, in my opinion, the learned
Magistrate ought to have allowed the application relying on the
observation made by this Court in the case of Prakash Sheth
(supra). This Court in the case of Prakash Sheth (supra) has
held that the first informant is entitled for hearing in Revision
Application claiming discharge by the accused. The said judgment
has been distinguished by the learned Magistrate holding that at
the stage of revision the first informant is entitled to be heard.
7.      In my opinion, the interpretation adopted by the learned
Magistrate is misplaced. If the judgment of the learned Single
Judge of this Court is considered as a whole, it is clear that locus
of the first informant has been considered by this Court and has
held that the person being first informant is entitled to the
opportunity of hearing.
8.      Therefore, in my opinion, the learned Magistrate ought to
have allowed the application for intervention filed by the
applicant. Hence, following order:
The application dated 29th February 2020 filed by the
applicant below Exhibit 7 in Criminal Case No.347/PW/2018 is
allowed.
9.      Rule. Rule made is absolute in above terms. No costs.
