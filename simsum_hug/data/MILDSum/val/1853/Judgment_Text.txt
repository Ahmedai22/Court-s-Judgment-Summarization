This petition has been filed under Section 482 Cr.P.C. for
quashing of FIR No.236 dated 15.09.2021 (Annexure P-1), under
Sections 384, 511 and 506 IPC, registered at Police Station Lehra,
District Sangrur along with all consequential proceedings emanating
The FIR in the present case has been registered on
15.09.2021, on       the   statement     of  respondent    No.2    Jagdeep
Singh/complainant, as per which, the occurrence has been stated to
have taken place during the period starting from 10.10.2019 to
15.09.2021. In his statement, the complainant has alleged that the
petitioner was having enmity against father of the complainant since
2008 and the petitioner in connivance with his accomplices, had got
registered a false rape case against the complainant in the year 2019,
so that he could blackmail the complainant and could take Rs.14 lakhs
from the complainant and could take revenge on account of his enmity
and in the said FIR, the SHO and Superintendent of Police had
declared the complainant innocent. It is further alleged that as per the
enquiry report of the police officials, the petitioner got the said false
case registered against the complainant for taking Rs.14 lakhs from
the complainant. It is further alleged that in the year 2020, Gurjit
Singh had told the complainant that one girl ‘S’ (name withheld) was
demanding money by blackmailing the said Gurjit Singh and the
complainant being an advocate, advised Gurjit Singh to get a case
registered against the said girl ‘S’ and as per the advice given by the
complainant, the said Gurjit Singh got a case registered under Section
384 IPC against ‘S’ and it was the petitioner who helped ‘S’ in getting
bail and then provoked ‘S’ to register a false case against the
complainant, but said ‘S’ refused to do so and got registered the rape
case i.e. case 307/2020, only against Gurjit Singh, which was
subsequently cancelled as the same was found to be false. It is further
alleged that now, the petitioner, in connivance with wrong persons, is
demanding Rs.14 lakhs from the complainant and has threatened that
in case, the said amount is not paid, then a false rape case will again
be registered against the complainant. On the basis of the said
complaint and allegations, the present FIR under Sections 384, 511
and 506 IPC has been registered.
Learned counsel for the petitioner has submitted that the
registration of the present FIR is a complete abuse of the process of
the Court. It is submitted that the FIR in question can be divided into
two parts. The first part pertaining to the allegations with respect to
the rape case filed in the year 2019 by ‘R’ (name withheld) against
Gupreet Singh @ Goldy, Jagdeep Singh son of Najar Singh and
Respondent No.2/Complainant and in the second part, the allegations
pertain to the year 2020 involving Gurjit Singh and the second girl ‘S’
(name withheld) as per which, the Petitioner in connivance with other
persons had been demanding Rs. 14 lakhs from Respondent
No.2/complainant failing which, the petitioner would get another false
case registered against respondent no.2/complainant. It is argued that
even a perusal of the FIR would show that the period during which the
alleged offences have been committed is from 10.10.2019 to
15.09.2020. Reference has been made to Annexure P-2, which is an
FIR bearing No.263 dated 10.10.2019, registered under Section 376,
342, 506 and 120-B IPC and Section 8 of the Protection of Children
from Sexual Offence Act, 2012 which was registered at the instance
of one girl ‘R’ (name withheld) and in the said case, the respondent
no.2/complainant was also made an accused in addition to Gurpreet
Singh @ Goldy and Jagdeep Singh son of Najar Singh. It is stated that
the first part of the present FIR relates to the said FIR No.263 dated
10.10.2019 and with respect to the same, it is submitted that the
complainant-respondent No.2 had filed an application dated
07.07.2020 in the Court of Judicial Magistrate, 1st Class, Moonak
against the said girl ‘R’, the present petitioner as well as three other
persons. The said application has been annexed as Annexure P-5
along with the present petition. Learned counsel for the petitioner has
referred to the said application and has specifically highlighted the
allegations made at page Nos.54, 58 and 59 of the paper-book with
respect to the allegations of the alleged demand of Rs.14 lakhs by the
present petitioner and the false implication of the complainant by the
petitioner in the said rape case. Reference has also been made to the
prayer clause to show that a prayer was made to register a case under
Sections 211, 193, 389 and 120-B IPC. It is submitted that the said
case had come up before the Judicial Magistrate, 1st Class, Moonak on
20.07.2020, on which date, the Judicial Magistrate, 1st Class, Moonak
observed that the Court was of the opinion that the facts disclosed in
the application did not warrant registration of the FIR and treated the
application under Section 156(3) as a criminal complaint and
adjourned the same to 21.08.2020 for pre-summoning evidence. It is
further submitted that the said girl ‘R’ (name withheld) appeared in
the witness box as PW-1 in the FIR No.263 on 17.08.2021 and made
specific allegations against respondent No.2 and on the basis of the
said allegations, an application dated 24.08.2021 under Section 319
Cr.P.C. for summoning of respondent No.2 as an accused was filed. It
is argued that without disclosing the factum of the filing the
application under Section 156(3) Cr.P.C. as well as the order dated
20.07.2020, respondent No.2 has got the present FIR registered. The
same is stated to be an act of active concealment and abuse of the
process of the Court on part of the respondent No.2. It is also
submitted that once the Judicial Magistrate 1st Class, Moonak had
observed that the application under Section 156(3) did not warrant
registration of the FIR and the allegations made in the said application
under Section 156(3) Cr.P.C. were similar to the allegations made in
the first part of the FIR, then, it was not for the police officials to act
in violation of the orders passed by the Judicial Magistrate, 1st Class,
Moonak and register the present FIR. It is submitted that the
complainant/respondent No.2 by getting the present FIR registered
has in fact tried to nullify the order dated 20.07.2020 passed by the
Judicial Magistrate, 1st Class, Moonak, without even challenging the
said order before a higher forum.In order to complete the chain of
events with respect to the first part, learned counsel for the petitioner
has stated that after registration of the present case, respondent No.2
had withdrawn the said complaint under Section 156(3) Cr.P.C. and
for the said purpose, he has referred to the order dated 11.12.2021
(Annexure P-11), at page 216 of the paperbook. Learned counsel for
the petitioner has further submitted that the allegations in the FIR with
respect to the fact that respondent No.2 was implicated in a false case
in the year 2019 and was exonerated by the police, cannot even
remotely stand, on account of the fact that respondent No.2 has been
summoned under Section 319 Cr.P.C. vide order dated 01.12.2021
passed by the Sessions Judge, Sangrur and the said order has been
annexed with the paperbook as Annexure P-9. Paragraph 8 of the said
order would show that respondent No.2 has been summoned to face
trial under Sections 363, 376(D) and 384 of the IPC along with the
other accused persons for 23.12.2021.
With respect to the second part of the FIR, in which
allegations pertaining to the year 2020 have been made involving
Gurjit Singh and the girl ‘S’ (name withheld) and with respect to the
petitioner demanding Rs.14 lakhs failing which, respondent
No.2/complainant has been threatened to be implicated in another
false case of rape, it is submitted that a second complaint under
Section 156(3) Cr.P.C. had been filed before the Judicial Magistrate,
1st Class, Moonak, in which, the present petitioner was also made an
accused and a prayer was made for registration of FIR under Sections
116, 195, 211, 384, 389 read with Sections 511 and 120-B IPC. The
said application has been annexed as Annexure R-2/1 by respondent
No.2. Specific reference has been made to the averments made in the
said application, moreso, pargraphs No.5, 6 and 8 to highlight that the
allegations with respect to the petitioner wanting to extort money from
respondent No.2 and implicating him in a false case of rape by taking
the help of second girl ‘S’ (name withheld), have been made and the
said allegations are similar to the allegations made in the second part
of the present FIR. It is submitted that although the said application is
not dated, but since the said application was withdrawn on 22.03.2021
(Annexure P-12), thus, it is apparent that the said application was filed
prior to 22.03.2021. It is argued that the said application was also
prior to the registration of the present i.e. FIR No.236 dated
15.09.2021 and yet, in the present FIR, no reference with respect to
the filing of the said application under Section 156(3) Cr.P.C., much
less, the order dated 22.03.2021 has been made. Learned counsel for
the petitioner has relied upon a judgment of the Hon’ble Supreme
Court of India in “Moti Lal Songara Vs. Prem Prakash @ Pappu”,
reported as 2013(9) SCC 199, to contend that suppression of a vital
fact, which is in the special knowledge of a person would itself be a
ground for quashing of the proceedings, moreso, when the Court finds
that a party has abused the process of the Court. Learned counsel for
the petitioner has submitted that in the above-cited case, accused
therein, had challenged the order under Section 319 Cr.P.C., without
disclosing to the Court that charges had been framed against him and
the accused therein was successful in getting the order under Section
319 Cr.P.C. set aside. The Hon’ble Supreme Court had allowed the
appeal of the appellant therein and set aside the orders vide which the
order summoning the accused under section 319 was set aside and
thus, upheld the order summoning the accused therein by observing
that it was a clear case of suppression of a vital fact which was in the
knowledge of the accused therein.
Reliance has also been placed upon a judgment of the
Hon’ble Supreme Court in case “Mrs. Priyanka Srivastava and
another Vs. State of U.P. and others, reported as 2015(6) SCC 287,
to contend that the proceedings under Section 156(3) Cr.P.C are on a
higher footing than the proceedings under Section 154 Cr.P.C.,
inasmuch as, in the said proceedings under Section 156(3) Cr.P.C., a
Court of law is involved and even in the said proceedings, the Hon’ble
Supreme Court had observed that at the time of filing of the
application under Section 156(3) Cr.P.C., it was incumbent upon the
complainant/applicant to specifically indicate that earlier applications
under Section 154 (1) and 154 (3) have been filed. Even supporting
affidavit is also required to be filed alongwith the application under
Section 156 (3) CrPC. It is submitted that once in the proceedings
under Section 156(3) Cr.P.C., it is necessary to mention about the said
application, it is equally incumbent upon respondent No.2 to have
mentioned about the filing of application under Section 156(3) Cr.P.C.
before the Judicial Magistrate, 1st Class, Moonak in his complaint on
the basis of which the present FIR has been registered. It is, thus,
submitted that the present petition for quashing deserves to be allowed
solely on the ground of active concealment/suppression of the
proceedings under Section 156(3) Cr.P.C and the orders passed
therein. Additionally, it is submitted that once respondent No.2 has
been summoned in proceedings under Section 319 Cr.P.C., then, the
allegations in the FIR to the effect that respondent No.2 was falsely
involved in the case,cannot stand. It is submitted that the FIR also
deserves to be quashed on the ground that the police officials cannot
act in violation of the the orders passed by the Judicial Magistrate, 1st
Class, Moonak, moreso, the order dated 20.07.2020 vide which,it was
specifically observed that the application under Section 156(3) CrPC
did not warrant registration of an FIR. Learned counsel for the
petitioner has also argued that even the allegations to the effect that
the petitioner is demanding Rs.14 lakhs and is threatening the
complainant to involve in a false rape case in case the amount is not
paid, are vague, inasmuch as, no details as to when the said demand
was made or when the threat was issued have been mentioned in the
FIR and at any rate, would not constitute an offence and have
apparently been made only to get the present false FIR registered for
mala-fide reasons to harass the present petitioner. It is submitted that
the act and conduct of respondent No.2 is contemptuous, inasmuch as
respondent No.2 has made every effort to win over the prosecutrix or
to pressurize the prosecutrix with respect to the FIR No.263 dated
15.09.2021. It is submitted that initially an attempt was made to
falsely involve the said prosecutrix ‘R’ in proceedings under Section
182 IPC and once the same was rejected on the basis of an opinion
given by the Deputy DA, Sangrur, then a complaint was also got filed
from the said prosecutrix ‘R’, even after she had given evidence
against respondent No.2 before the trial court and in the said
complaint, certain averments in favour of respondent No.2 were
sought to be incorporated. However, the said complaint was also
withdrawn on 18.11.2021 (Annexure P-13) as respondent No.2 was
aware that any statement contrary to the evidence given in the Court
could result in initiation of proceedings against the persons, who were
trying to influence the said witness. It is submitted that the present
FIR was also registered on false, frivolous and vague allegations only
on the understanding of Respondent no 2 that the present petitioner
may have some influence on the said prosecutrix ‘R’ and by
registering the present FIR, the petitioner might persuade the said
prosecutrix ‘R’ to withdraw the application under Section 319 Cr.P.C,
which had been filed on 24.08.2021, immediately prior to the
registration of the FIR dated 15.09.2021. It is submitted that in fact
respondent No.2 had abused the process of the Court and had made
every attempt to influence the prosecutrix and to tamper with the
evidence. It is submitted that no offence under Section 384, Section
511 or Section 506 has been made out.
On the other hand, learned State counsel and counsel for
the complainant have opposed the present petition for quashing of FIR
and have submitted that the present petition under Section 482 Cr.P.C.
deserves to be dismissed on the ground that the report under Section
173 Cr.P.C in the present case has not been submitted and have relied
upon the judgment of the Hon’ble Supreme Court in “Mahendra
K.C.Vs. State of Karnataka and another”, 2021(4) R.C.R. (Criminal)
653, to contend that at the stage before the report, the High Court
cannot test the veracity of the allegations nor can it proceed in the
manner that a Judge conducting a trial would, on the basis of evidence
collected during the course of the trial. Learned counsel for
respondent No.2 has referred to Annexure P-5, which is an application
under Section 156(3) Cr.P.C., and has highlighted paragraph 7 (page
52 of the paperbook), to contend that it has been specifically averred
in the said application under Section 156(3) Cr.P.C. that Kulwant
Singh had called up respondent No.2 and had informed him that
respondent No.2 should give Rs.14 lakhs and the said Kulwant Singh
is the real uncle of prosecutrix ‘R’ and has submitted that there was a
telephonic conversation between the said Kulwant Singh, the present
petitioner and Respondent No.2 with respect to the said demand. It is,
thus, submitted that the allegations with respect to the first incident as
mentioned in the present FIR, have substance. Learned counsel for
respondent No.2 has further referred to statement under Section 161
Cr.P.C. of respondent No.2, which is stated to have been recorded on
16.09.2021 i.e., one day after registration of the FIR and has
submitted that in the said statement the allegations have been made
with respect to the petitioner asking for Rs.14 lakhs on 06.09.2021
from respondent No.2, failing which, he would falsely implicate
respondent No.2 in a criminal case. It is submitted that all the said
factors would be taken into consideration at the time of trial and thus,
the present petition deserves to be dismissed.
Learned counsel for the petitioner in rebuttal to the said
argument has submitted that the counsel for respondent no.2 is
seeking to rely upon the allegations/averments in the petition under
Section 156(3) Cr.P.C. dated 07.07.2020 (Annexure P-5),after
considering which,on 20.07.2020, the Judicial Magistrate First Class,
Moonak had observed that the application does not warrant
registration of an FIR. It is further submitted that even in the alleged
statement under Section 161 Cr.P.C., there is no mention about the
filing of the earlier application under Section 156(3) Cr.P.C. or the
orders thereon and thus, his plea of active concealment, would stand.
It is submitted that it is surprising as to how respondent No.2 has got
the copy of the said statement under Section 161 Cr.P.C. without the
final report under Section 173 Cr.P.C. being submitted. It is further
submitted that in the alleged statement under Section 161, reference
has been made to an incident of 06.09.2021 whereas in the FIR which
has been registered on 15.09.2021, after the said date, there is no
reference with respect to the said incident.
With respect to the maintainability of the petition under
Section 482 Cr.P.C., learned counsel for the petitioner has relied upon
the judgment of Hon’ble Supreme Court passed in case “Ajay Mitra
Vs. State of M.P.& Ors., reported as 2003(3) SCC 11, to contend that
where the FIR and the criminal proceedings are an abuse of the
process of the Court or does not constitute any offfence or is mala-fide
or involves a legal argument, then even in case, the report under
Section 173 Cr.P.C. has not been submitted, still, the FIR can be
quashed. Further, reference has also been made to the provision of
Section 482 Cr.P.C. to state that as per the said provision, nothing in
the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 shall deem to limit or affect the
inherent powers of the High Court to make such orders as may be
necessary to give effect to any order under this Code, or to prevent
abuse of the process of any Court or otherwise to secure the ends of
justice. It is submitted that the said provision does not in any way
envisage that the power under Section 482 Cr.P.C. cannot be
exercised unless the report under Section 173 Cr.P.C. is submitted.
This Court has heard the learned counsel for the parties
and perused the record.
This Court would first like to deal with the objection
raised by the learned counsel for the respondents with respect to the
maintainability of a petition under Section 482 for quashing of an FIR
without the final report under Section 173 CrPC having been
For determining the said objection, it would be pertinent
to note the relevant judgments on the said aspect.
The Hon’ble Supreme Court in Ajay Mitra’s case
(supra) has held as has observed as under: -
“Leave granted.
These appeals by special leave are directed against the
judgment and order dated January 16, 2002 of High Court of
Madhya Pradesh, by which three Petitions filed by the
appellants under Section 482 Cr.P.C. were dismissed.
xxx   xxx    xxx      xxx  xxx    xxx
Thereafter, the appellants filed three Criminal
Miscellaneous Petitions under Section 482 Cr.P.C. before the
High Court for quashing of the FIR and the proceedings of
the case before the learned Magistrate. After hearing the
parties, the High Court held that the investigation had not yet
commenced in connection with the FIRs which had been
registered at the Police Station and, therefore, the Petitions
were pre-mature and accordingly all the three Petitions were
rejected.
The High Court has held that the Petitions filed by the
appellants for quashing the complaint and the FIRs
registered against them are pre-mature. The question which
arises is that where the complaint or the FIR does not
disclose commission of a cognizable offence, whether the
same can be quashed at the initial stage? This question was
examined by this Court in State of West Bengal &Ors. V.
and it was held that the First Information Report which does
not allege or disclose that the essential requirements of the
penal provision are prima facie satisfied, cannot form the
foundation or constitute the starting point of a lawful
investigation. It is surely not within the province of the police
to investigate into a Report (FIR) which does not disclose the
commission of a cognizable offence and the code does not
impose upon them the duty of inquiry in such cases. It was
further held that an investigation can be quashed if no
cognizable offence is disclosed by the FIR. The same question
has been considered inState of Haryana &Ors. V. Ch.
Bhajan Lal &Ors. 1991(3) RCR (Criminal) 383 (SC) and
after considering all the earlier decisions, the category of
cases, in which the Court can exercise its extra-ordinary
power under Article 226 of the Constitution or the inherent
power under Section 482 Cr.P.C. either to prevent abuse of
the process of any Court or to secure the ends of justice, were
sumarised in para 108 of the Report and sub- paras 1 to 3
thereof are being reproduced hereinbelow :
"1. Where the allegations made in the First
Information Report or the complaint, even if they are taken at
their face value and accepted in their entirety do not prima
facie constitute any offence or make out a case against the
accused.
2. Where the allegations in the First Information
Report and other materials, if any, accompanying the F.I.R.
do not disclose a cognizable offence, justifying an
investigation by police officers under Section 156(1) of the
Code except under an order of a Magistrate within the
purview of Section 155(2) of the Code.
3. Where the uncontroverted allegations made in the
FIR or complaint and the evidence collected in support of the
same do not disclose the commission of any offence and make
out a case against the accused."
The said judgment by the Three Judges Bench of the
Hon’ble Supreme Court had affirmatively held that where an FIR does
not disclose the essential requirements of the penal provision or does
not disclose the commission of a cognizable offence, the same can be
quashed at the initial stage. Reference has also been made to the
judgment of Hon’ble Supreme Court in case “State of Haryana and
others Vs. Ch. Bhajan Lal & Ors., 1991(3) RCR (Criminal) 383), in
which, it was observed that the High Court can exercise its extra-
ordinary power under Article 226 of the Constitution or the inherent
power under Section 482 Cr.P.C. 1973 either to prevent abuse of the
process of any Court or to secure the ends of justice.
The Hon’ble Supreme Court of India in “R Kalyani vs.
Janak C. Mehta” reported as 2009 (1) SCC 516 has held as under:
“Leave granted.
2. Appellant lodged a First Information Report (FIR)
against the respondents on or about 4.1.2003 under Sections
409, 420 and 468 read with Section 34 of the Indian Penal
3. First and second respondent approached the High
Court for an order for quashing of the said FIR as also the
investigation initiated pursuant thereto or in furtherance
thereof. The High Court allowed the said proceedings by
reason of the impugned order dated 29.4.2004.Mr. K.K.
Mani, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the appellant,
would, in support of the appeal, contend :
(1) The High Court exercised its inherent jurisdiction
under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure wholly
illegally and without jurisdiction insofar as it entered into the
disputed questions of fact in regard to the involvement of the
respondents as the contents of the first information report
disclose an offence of cheating, criminal breech of trust and
forgery.
(2) While admittedly the investigation was not even
complete, the High Court could not have relied upon the
documents furnished by the defendants either for the purpose
of finding out absence of mens rea on the part of the
applicants or their involvement in the case.
(3) Respondent Nos.1 and 2 herein being high ranking
officers of M/s. Shares and Securities Ltd., a company dealing
in shares, were vicariously liable for commission of the
offence being in day to day charge of the affairs thereof.
(4) An offence of forgery being a serious one and in
view of the fact that the respondent No.2 forwarded a letter
purporting to authorise the accused No.3 to transfer shares to
the National Stock Exchange, he must be held to have the
requisite intention to commit the said offence along with the
respondent No.3.
(5) In any view of the matter, the respondent No. 3
being not an applicant before the High Court, the entire
criminal prosecution could not have quashed by the High
In Hamid v. Rashid alias Rasheed & Ors. [(2008) 1
SCC 474], this Court opined :
"6. We are in agreement with the contention advanced
on behalf of the complainant appellant. Section 482 Criminal
Procedure Code saves the inherent powers of the High Court
and its language is quite explicit when it says that nothing in
the Code shall be deemed to limit or affect the inherent
powers of the High Court to make such orders as may be
necessary to give effect to any order under the Code, or to
prevent abuse of the process of any Court or otherwise to
secure the ends of justice. A procedural Code, however
exhaustive, cannot expressly provide for all time to come
against all the cases or points that may possibly arise, and in
order that justice may not suffer, it is necessary that every
court must in proper cases exercise its inherent power for the
ends of justice or for the purpose of carrying out the other
provisions of the Code. It is well established principle that
every Court has inherent power to act ex debito justitiae to do
that real and substantial justice for the administration of
which alone it exists or to prevent abuse of the process of the
One of the paramount duties of the Superior Courts is
to see that a person who is apparently innocent is not
subjected to persecution and humiliation on the basis of a
false and wholly untenable complaint.
A vicarious liability can be fastened only by reason of
a provision of a statute and not otherwise. For the said
purpose, a legal fiction has to be created. Even under a
special statute when the vicarious criminal liability is
fastened on a person on the premise that he was in-charge of
the affairs of the company and responsible to it, all the
ingredients laid down under the statute must be fulfilled. A
legal fiction must be confined to the object and purport for
which it has been created. In Sham Sunder & Ors. v. State of
Haryana [(1989) 4 SCC 630], this Court held :
"9. But we are concerned with a criminal
liability under penal provision and not a civil"
liability. The penal provision must be strictly
construed in the first place. Secondly, there is no
vicarious liability in criminal law unless the statute
takes that also within its fold. Section 10 does not
provide for such liability. It does not make all the
partners liable for the offence whether they do
business or not."
27.   If a person, thus, has to be proceeded with as being
vicariously liable for the acts of the company, the company must be
made an accused. In any event, it would be a fair thing to do so, as
legal fiction is raised both against the Company as well as the
person responsible for the acts of the Company.
xxx   xxx    xxx      xxx   xxx   xxx
30. The appeal is dismissed with the aforementioned
observations.”
A perusal of the said judgment would show that the High
Court had in a petition under section 482 quashed the FIR without the
investigation having been completed and the said order was upheld by
the Hon’ble Apex Court qua the persons who had filed the petition
under Section 482. The specific objection of the appellant therein to
the effect that the investigation was not complete was noticed in
Paragraph 3 of the said judgment. In the abovesaid case, it was
observed that for a person to be proceeded against vicariously for the
acts of a company, the company must be made an accused. It was also
observed that vicarious liability can be fastened only by reason of a
provision of a statute and not otherwise and incase, under a special
statute vicarious criminal liability is fastened upon a person on the
allegation that he was in-charge of the affairs of the company, then all
the other ingredients laid down under the statute must be fulfilled. It is
thus apparent that in case, a legal issue is raised by an accused person
to the effect that he has been vicariously prosecuted without there
being any provision in the Act for vicarious liability under which he is
being prosecuted, then his petition under Section 482 CrPC raising
such issues could not be rejected solely on the ground that report
under Section 173 has not been filed.
The Hon’ble Supreme Court in “T.T. Antony Vs. State of
Kerela” reported as 2001 (6) SCC 181 has observed as under: -
“However, the sweeping power of investigation does
not warrant subjecting a citizen each time to fresh
investigation by the police in respect of the same incident,
giving rise to one or more cognizable offences, consequent
upon filing of successive FIRs whether before or after filing
the final report under Section 173(2) Criminal Procedure
Code, 1973 It would clearly be beyond the purview of
sections 154 and 156 Criminal Procedure Code, 1973 nay, a
case of abuse of the statutory power of investigation in a
given case. In our view a case of a fresh investigation based
on the second or successive FIRs, not being a counter case,
filed in connection with the same or connected cognizable
offence alleged to have been committed in the course of the
same transaction and in respect of which pursuant to the first
FIR either investigation is underway or final report under
Section 173(2) has been forwarded to the Magistrate, may be
a fit case for exercise of power under Section 482 Criminal
Procedure Code, 1973 or under Articles 226/227 of the
The course adopted in this case, namely, the
registration of the information as the second FIR in regard to
the same incident and making a fresh investigation is not
permissible under the scheme of the provisions of the
Criminal Procedure Code as pointed out above, therefore, the
investigation undertaken and the report thereof cannot but be
invalid. We have, therefore, no option except to quash the
same leaving it open of the investigating agency to seek
permission in Crime No. 353/94 or 354/94 of the Magistrate
to make further investigation, forward further report or
reports and thus proceed in accordance with law.”
A perusal of the above judgment would show that it was
observed by the Hon’ble Supreme Court of India that in case, with
respect to one incident an FIR has already been registered, then a
second FIR with respect to the same incident cannot be registered and
in case the same is registered then the High Court while exercising its
powers under Section 482 CrPC would be well within its rights to
quash the second FIR. The same principle has been followed by the
Hon’ble Supreme Court in the case of “Amitbhai Anil Chandra Shah
vs. Central Beureu of Investigation and Anr” reported 2013 (6) SCC
348. Thus, in a situation where a second FIR is registered with respect
to the same incident on which an FIR has already been registered, the
petition for quashing of the second FIR should not be thrown out on
the ground that the report under Section 173 CrPC has not been
A Coordinate Bench of this Court in “Kuldeep Raj
Mahajan vs. Hukam Chand” in a judgment dated 05.12.2007 passed
in CRM-34272-M of 2003 had observed as under:
“ Kuldip Raj Mahajan has approached this Court by
way of instant petition under Section 482 of the Code of
Criminal Procedure (in short 'the Code') for quashing of
criminal complaint No. 130 of 2000 instituted by Hukam
Chand-respondent against the petitioner in the court of
Judicial Magistrate Ist Class, Hisar (Annexure P-1) under
section 3 of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes
(Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989 (in short 'the Act') and
Section 506 of the Indian Penal Code, along with summoning
order dated 19.9.2002 (Annexure P-2).
2. The respondent inter alia alleged in the impugned
complaint Annexure P-1 that he belongs to Dhanak caste
which is a Scheduled Caste whereas the petitioner belongs to
Vaish caste which is a higher caste. The respondent, at the
relevant time, was working as Head Cashier in State Bank of
Patiala, Branch Mayar, District Hisar where the petitioner
was posted as Branch Manager. On 9.9.19999, at about 4.45
p.m., the petitioner insulted the respondent in the presence of
other employees and abused him by his caste. Petitioner's
utterances demeaning the respondent by caste have been
quoted in paragraph 4 of the complaint. Tilak Raj Khurana,
Cashier Incharge and also Jag Ram and Wazir Singh,
Watchmen-cum-Peons were present there at that time. They
objected to the offensive utterances made by the petitioner,
but the petitioner continued with his abusive language. On
10.9.1999, the respondent reported this matter to the higher
authorities which further annoyed the petitioner, who ran
towards respondent to assault him. Same witnesses saved the
respondent. Petitioner was using abusive caste based
language against the respondent and threatened to implicate
him in a false case and to get him removed from service. The
petitioner extended threat to the life of the respondent. The
respondent filed a complaint in Police Station Hisar and later
on made representation on 29.10.1999 to Inspector General
of Police, Hisar Range, Hisar. Another representation was
made to the Inspector General of Police on 9.11.1999.
Ultimately FIR No. 11 dated 8.1.2000 was registered, but the
police, even thereafter, did not take any action nor arrested
the petitioner. On 23.4.2000, the respondent went to the
Police Station to inquire about the progress in the matter and
was told that due to political pressure, police officials were
unable to arrest the petitioner. Thereupon the respondent
filed the impugned complaint dated 24.4.2000 (Annexure P-
1). After recording of preliminary evidence, the learned
Magistrate, vide impugned order dated 19.9.2002 (Annexure
P-2), summoned the petitioner as accused for offence under
Section 3 of the Act and Section 506 of the Indian Penal
Code. Feeling aggrieved, the petitioner has filed the instant
petition for quashing of the impugned complaint and
summoning order.
It would indicate that the respondent, after being
aware of the cancellation of the FIR, filed the impugned
complaint, but did not disclose in the complaint that FIR
lodged by him had been cancelled.
Perusal of impugned summoning order (Annexure P-2)
reveals that there is no reference at all to the investigation
report/cancellation report of the police in the summoning
order.      Without      considering      the     investigation
report/cancellation report of the police, the impugned
summoning order could not have been legally passed by the
learned Magistrate. The respondent, despite knowledge,
concealed the cancellation report of the police from the
learned Magistrate. This is another indicator of mala fide on
the part of the respondent.
11. Learned counsel for the petitioner next pointed out
that offence under Section 506 of the Indian Penal Code, as
well as offence under Section 3 of the Act, is not made out
from the allegations in the impugned complaint. It was
pointed out that alleged empty threat, to implicate the
respondent in false case or to get him removed from service,
would not come within the mischief of criminal intimidation
punishable under Section 506 of the Indian Penal Code.
There is considerable merit in the submission. Alleged threat
by the petitioner could not have caused any alarm to the
respondent nor he was being compelled to do an act which he
was not legally bound to do or to omit to do an act which he
was entitled to do. The allegations in the complaint do not
make out a case of criminal intimidation punishable under
There cannot be any quarrel with this legal
proposition. Disputed questions of fact cannot be gone into in
a petition under section 482 of the Code. However, this Court
cannot be a helpless spectator when it is made out that the
criminal prosecution is mala fide and an abuse of the
process of the court. In fact, this Court has inherent power
and corresponding duty to prevent abuse of the process of
any court or otherwise to secure the ends of justice. In the
instant case, the impugned complaint is result of mala fide as
the respondent was nursing grudge against the petitioner as
discussed herein above.
After investigation by Gazetted Officer, the FIR lodged
in the same matter was found to be false and cancellation
report was submitted by the police. The respondent, despite
being aware of the cancellation report, concealed the same
from the learned Magistrate. The impugned summoning order
has also been passed without considering or even referring to
the   cancellation report. Keeping       in   view all these
circumstances, it is a fit case in which this Court has to
exercise its inherent powers under section 482 of the Code by
quashing the impugned complaint and summoning order so
as to prevent the abuse of process of court and to secure the
ends of justice.”
A perusal of the above judgment would show that it has
been observed that the High Court cannot be a helpless spectator
when it is made out that the criminal prosecution is mala fide and an
abuse of the process of the court and that the High Court has inherent
power and a corresponding duty to prevent the abuse of the process of
the court or otherwise to secure the ends of justice and in the said
case, the petition under Section 482 Cr.P.C. was allowed on grounds
which are akin to the present case inasmuch as, there was concealment
by the complainant therein in his complaint with respect to the fact
that in the FIR registered earlier regarding the same occurrence, a
cancellation report had been submitted and the same was considered
as an indicator of mala fide on the part of the complainant therein and
was considered as one of the grounds for quashing the proceedings. It
was further observed that even the allegations in the complaint with
respect to threat given by the accused therein to complainant therein
was found not to make out a case under Section 506 IPC.
The aspect with respect to concealment/suppression of
facts has also been dealt in detail by the Hon’ble Supreme Court of
India in the case of Moti Lal (supra) as well Mrs. Priyanka
Srivastava (supra). In the case of Priyanka Srivastava (supra), the
Hon’ble Supreme Court had observed that in the application under
Section 156(3) Cr.P.C., it was necessary to be spell out the details of
the applications filed under Sections 154(1) and 154(3) Cr.P.C. in the
application under Section 156(3) Cr.P.C. Even supporting affidavit
was required to be submitted. The copy of the said judgment was
circulated to all the High Courts for further circulation to the Sessions
Judges and to the Magistrates. Once, in the application under Section
156(3) Cr.P.C., it is found incumbent to mention about the application
filed before the police, it would be equally incumbent or rather, the
higher duty of the complainant to mention about the application under
Section 156(3) Cr.P.C. filed and the orders thereof in his complaint
before the police when the complaint before the police is subsequent
to the application filed under Section 156(3) Cr.P.C.
The judgment of the Hon’ble Supreme Court of India in
“Mahendra KC” (supra) relied upon by the Learned Counsel for the
Respondent no.2 would not further the case of respondent no.2 in any
manner. In the said case, none of the issues i.e., either of active
concealment or registration of FIR being in violation of the order
passed by the Judicial Magistrate or forum shopping or criminal
proceedings being an abuse of the process of law or being mala-fide
etc. raised by the petitioner in the present petition, were the basis for
quashing of the FIR by the High Court. The relevant portion of the
said judgment is reproduced hereinbelow: -
5. The FIR was registered at 20:00 hours on 6
December 2016. The second respondent-accused, an SLAO
for Bengaluru City, and another driver of his car were named
as accused. The suicide note recorded by the deceased
allegedly in his own handwriting contains a detailed
narration of the properties alleged to have been illegally
acquired by the second respondent. Besides detailing the
properties which were acquired by the accused in
paragraphs 1 to 13, the suicide note refers to:
(i) The transfer of funds in several lakhs of rupees by
the accused to his relatives by using the cell phone and bank
account of the deceased;
(ii) The conversion of approximately Rs. 100 crores
into currency notes of Rs. 2,000/-, Rs. 100/- and Rs. 50/-;
(iii) The knowledge of the deceased in regard to the
transactions of the accused as a result of which he had been
threatened to be killed "by rowdies";
(iv) A raid conducted against the accused by the
establishment of the Lokayukta of Karnataka while he was
posted in the Housing Board;
(v) The involvement of judges to whom presents or
(vi) The payment of salary to the deceased having been
stopped at the behest of the accused;
(vii) The accused having used the deceased for
changing currency worth over Rs. 75 crores; and
(viii) The deceased being in knowledge of "all the
information", and when a shortage of an amount of Rs. 8
lakh was found, the deceased had been directed to make
good the deficiency, failing which he was threatened to be
killed by rowdies.
6. In this backdrop, the deceased recorded that he
had been threatened by the accused and hence was ending
his life by consuming poison. Both the second respondent
and his "house driver" were specifically named as
responsible for this death.
7. The second respondent-accused was arrested on 11
December 2016. On 12 December 2016, based on a
complaint made by BT Suresh, a friend of the deceased, an
FIR    was     registered  against the    accused as    Crime
No.128/2016 in Ijur Police Station, Ramnagar District, under
Sections 323, 324, 341, 342, 363, 506, 114 read with Sections
120B and 34 of the IPC.
8. On 18 April 2017, the accused instituted a petition
under section 482 CrPC, 1973 for quashing the FIR
registered as Crime No. 565/2016. A Single Judge of the High
Court of Karnataka stayed investigation and proceedings in
Crime No.565/2016. After arguments were heard, judgment
was reserved on 12 November 2019. Eventually, by his
judgment delivered nearly 6 months thereafter on 29 May
2020, the Single Judge allowed the petition and quashed all
proceedings relating to the complaint and FIR registered as
9. At the outset, it is necessary to elucidate the reasons
which have weighed with the High Court in quashing the FIR.
The High Court has held that:
(i) The suicide note which consists of 21 numbered
paragraphs gives a detailed account of the transactions
undertaken by the accused;
(ii) For a person who has made such a detailed
account of twenty transactions in the suicide note, it can be
prudently expected that the deceased would have furnished
details of the threats administrated to him by the accused;
iii) In the unnumbered paragraph of the suicide note
"the totally different story" is set out, stating that the accused
threatened to kill the deceased since there was a shortage of
cash to the tune of Rs 8 lacs for which the accused suspected
the deceased to be responsible;
(iv) The deceased held the accused responsible for
withholding his salary for three months;
(v) Though a query was put to the Government Pleader
and counsel for the complainant as to whether the
investigation had thrown up any material which corroborated
the allegations set out in the suicide note, the GP submitted
that "they have not been able to unearth any material to
corroborate any of the allegations";
(vi) Though the petition was instituted before the High
Court on 18 April 2017, and was pending for over three
years, no corroborative material had been produced before
the Court by the investigating agency;
(vii) Even assuming that the accused has amassed
huge wealth, that would not constitute a good ground for a
person to commit suicide since it was not the case of the
deceased that the accused had deprived him of his wealth;
viii) The suicide note contains no incriminating
statement or material except for a bald and vague statement
that the accused had threatened the deceased;
(ix) The complaint does not disclose details of the
alleged threat nor does it state that the deceased had on
multiple occasions complained of having received threats
(x) The allegation in regard to the demand for
repayment of Rs 8 lacs rings hollow "as neither the
prosecution nor the de facto complainant had placed an iota
of material that the deceased was or had in fact been in
possession of huge sum of money";
(xi) No act proximate to the time of death is alleged
against the accused;
(xii) If the allegation of the demand of Rs. 8 lacs was
correct, it would have been natural for the accused to restrain
the deceased from leaving Bangalore to ensure the recovery
(xiii) The investigation had not thrown up any material
regarding the use of the mobile banking facilities of the
deceased for the transfer of funds;
(xiv) Neither the death-note nor investigation revealed
a threat call to the deceased;
(xv) The only witness who could have spoken about
the veracity of the suicide note was the deceased;
(xvi) If a threat had been administered to the deceased,
he would have narrated the incident to the complainant or his
(xvii) Even if a threat was given, the nature of the
threat would have to be examined particularly on the question
as to whether it was of such an alarming proportion so as to
drive a `normal person' to contemplate suicide;
(xviii) If the deceased had felt threatened by the
accused, this was belied by his visits to his village to meet his
parents and friends and the failure to lodge a complaint with
the police particularly when the Police Commissionerate was
a stone's throw away. This casts doubt on the veracity of the
(xix) Since the deceased had consumed alcohol, it is
possible that in the grip of intoxicants he had failed to act
(xx) The conduct of the deceased in attending a
marriage in a different town is indicative of the actions of a
(xxi) How the deceased had sourced the poison was
unknown.
10. The judgment of the Single Judge has given rise to
two special leave petitions under Article 136 of the
Constitution: one by the complainant and the second by the
State of Karnataka.
The High Court in the present case has virtually
proceeded to hold a trial, substituting its own perception for
what it believed should or should not have been the normal
course of human behavior. This is clearly impermissible.
17. The complaint in the present case on the basis of
which the FIR was registered contains a detailed account of:
(i) The knowledge of the deceased in regard to the
illegal activities of the accused;
(ii) The accused having used the deceased's bank
account for transfer of funds to his relatives;
(iii) The deceased having been threatened by the
accused and by his "house car driver" with death; and
(iv) The recovery of the suicide note which was also
uploaded on the Facebook account of the deceased; The
suicide note in turn provides a detailed account of
(a) The wealth amassed by the second respondent-
accused who was an SLAO, worth over Rs. 100 crores;
(b) The second respondent-accused having converted
approximately Rs. 100 crores into currency notes of various
(c) The knowledge of the deceased with respect the
illegal activities of the accused;
(d) The accused having used the deceased for the
conversion of currency notes amounting to over Rs. 75
(e) The payment of the salary of the deceased, who
was a driver having been stopped for three months;
(f) A threat of murder being administered to the
deceased following a shortage in the currency; and
(g) The deceased having decided to end his life by
consuming poison, having suffered at the hands of the
accused.
18. In this backdrop, it is impossible on a judicious
purview of the contents of the complaint and the suicide note
for a judicial mind to arrive at a conclusion that a case for
quashing the FIR had been established. In arriving at that
conclusion, the Single Judge has transgressed the well settled
limitations on the exercise of the powers under section 482
CrPC, 1973 and has encroached into a territory which is
reserved for a criminal trial.
19. The High Court has the power under Section 482
to issue such orders as are necessary to prevent the abuse of
legal process or otherwise, to secure the ends of justice. The
law on the exercise of power under Section 482 to quash an
FIR is well settled. In State of Orissa v. Saroj Kumar Sahoo,
(2005) 13 SCC 540, a two judge Bench of this Court,
"8. [...] While exercising powers under the section,
the court does not function as a court of appeal or
revision. Inherent jurisdiction under the section though
wide has to be exercised sparingly, carefully and with
caution and only when such exercise is justified by the
tests specifically laid down in the section itself. It is to be
exercised ex debito justitiae to do real and substantial
justice for the administration of which alone courts exist.
Authority of the court exists for advancement of justice
and if any attempt is made to abuse that authority so as
to produce injustice, the court has power to prevent
abuse. It would be an abuse of process of the court to
allow any action which would result in injustice and
prevent promotion of justice. In exercise of the powers
court would be justified to quash any proceeding if it
finds that initiation/continuance of it amounts to abuse of
the process of court or quashing of these proceedings
would otherwise serve the ends of justice. When no
offence is disclosed by the report, the court may examine
the question of fact. When a report is sought to be
quashed, it is permissible to look into the materials to
assess what the report has alleged and whether any
offence is made out even if the allegations are accepted
in toto."
20. In Bhajan Lal (supra), this Court laid down the
principles for the exercise of the jurisdiction by the High
Court in exercise of its powers under section 482 of the
CrPC, 1973 to quash an FIR. Justice Ratnavel Pandian laid
down the limits on the exercise of the power under section
482 CrPC, 1973 for quashing the FIR and observed:
"102. In the backdrop of the interpretation of the
various relevant provisions of the Code under Chapter XIV
and of the principles of law enunciated by this Court in a
series of decisions relating to the exercise of the
extraordinary power under Article 226 or the inherent
powers under Section 482 of the Code which we have
extracted and reproduced above, we give the following
categories of cases by way of illustration wherein such power
could be exercised either to prevent abuse of the process of
any court or otherwise to secure the ends of justice, though it
may not be possible to lay down any precise, clearly defined
and sufficiently channelised and inflexible guidelines or rigid
formulae and to give an exhaustive list of myriad kinds of
cases wherein such power should be exercised.
(1) Where the allegations made in the first information
report or the complaint, even if they are taken at their face
value and accepted in their entirety do not prima facie
constitute any offence or make out a case against the accused.
(2) Where the allegations in the first information
report and other materials, if any, accompanying the FIR do
not disclose a cognizable offence, justifying an investigation
by police officers under Section 156(1) of the Code except
under an order of a Magistrate within the purview of Section
155(2) of the Code.
(3) Where the uncontroverted allegations made in the
FIR or complaint and the evidence collected in support of the
same do not disclose the commission of any offence and make
out a case against the accused.
(4) Where, the allegations in the FIR do not constitute
a cognizable offence but constitute only a non-cognizable
offence, no investigation is permitted by a police officer
without an order of a Magistrate as contemplated under
Section 155(2) of the Code.
(5) Where the allegations made in the FIR or
complaint are so absurd and inherently improbable on the
basis of which no prudent person can ever reach a just
conclusion that there is sufficient ground for proceeding
against the accused.
(6) Where there is an express legal bar engrafted in
any of the provisions of the Code or the concerned Act (under
which a criminal proceeding is instituted) to the institution
and continuance of the proceedings and/or where there is a
specific provision in the Code or the concerned Act,
providing efficacious redress for the grievance of the
aggrieved party.
(7) Where a criminal proceeding is manifestly attended
with mala fide and/or where the proceeding is maliciously
instituted with an ulterior motive for wreaking vengeance on
the accused and with a view to spite him due to private and
personal grudge."
The judgment in Bhajan Lal (supra) has been recently
relied on by this Court in State of Telangana v. Managipet,
26. Instead of applying this settled principle, the High
Court has proceeded to analyze from its own perspective the
veracity of the allegations. It must be emphasized that this is
not a case where the High Court has arrived at a conclusion
that the allegations in the FIR or the complaint are so
absurd and inherently improbable on the basis of which no
prudent person could ever reach a just conclusion that there
is sufficient ground for proceeding against the accused. Nor
is this a case where the criminal proceeding is manifestly
mala fide or has been instituted with an ulterior motive of
taking vengeance on the accused. On the contrary, the
specific allegations in the FIR and in the complaint find due
reflection in the suicide note and establish a prima facie
case for abetment of suicide within the meaning of Sections
306 and 107 of the IPC. The entire judgment of the High
Court consists of a litany of surmises and conjectures and
such an exercise is beyond the domain of proceeding under
section 482 of the CrPC, 1973. The High Court has
proceeded to scrutinize what has been disclosed during the
investigation, ignoring that the investigation had been
stayed by an interim order of the High Court, during the
pendency of the proceedings under section 482.
27. The High Court observed that a prima facie case
for the commission of offence under Section 306 of the IPC is
not made out since: i) the suicide note does not describe the
specific threats; ii) details of the alleged demand of Rs. 8 lacs
from the deceased by the respondent-accused are not set out
in the suicide note; and iii) no material to corroborate the
allegations detailed in the suicide note has been unearthed by
the investigating agency. The High Court observed that since
the deceased took considerable time to write a twelve page
suicide note, "it would have been but natural for the author to
set out the details". The High Court has evidently travelled
far beyond the limits of its inherent power under section 482
CrPC, 1973 since instead of determining whether on a
perusal of the complaint, a prima facie case is made out, it
has analysed the sufficiency of the evidence with reference to
the suicide note and has commented upon and made strong
observations on the suicide note itself.
xxx    xxx   xxx      xxx   xxx     xxx
Further, the observation of the High Court that there
is no material to corroborate the allegations made in the
suicide note is erroneous since it is not a consideration for
the High Court while exercising its power under section 482
of the CrPC, 1973 particularly in view of the fact that the
trial has not begun and the Single Judge had stayed the
investigation in the criminal complaint.
xxx    xxx   xxx      xxx   xxx     xxx
The alleged suicide is of a person who was working as
a driver of a Special Land Acquisition Officer, who is a
public servant and against whom serious and grave
allegations of amassing wealth disproportionate to the known
sources of income were made by the deceased. The suicide
note contains a detailed account of the role of the accused in
the events which led to the deceased committing suicide.
These are matters of investigation and possibly trial. The
High Court stalled the investigation by granting an interim
order of stay. If the investigation had been allowed to
proceed, there would have been a revelation of material facts
which would aid in the trial, for the alleged offence against
the second respondent.
31. For the above reasons, we allow the appeals and
set aside the impugned judgment and order of the Single
Judge of the High Court of Karnataka dated 29 May 2020. In
the circumstances, the petition for quashing the FIR instituted
by the respondent-accused shall stand dismissed.
32. Pending application(s), if any, stand disposed of.”
A perusal of the above judgment would show that in the
said case, the FIR was registered under Section 306 and there was a
detailed suicide note of the deceased alleging that the accused person
had committed corruption of hundreds of crores and since the
deceased was in the knowledge of the said transactions, the accused
person had threatened to kill him and inspite of that, the High Court
had disregarded the suicide note without recording a finding that the
criminal proceedings were manifestly mala fide or had been instituted
with an ulterior motive and the Hon’ble Supreme observed that the
judgment of the High Court was based on surmises and conjectures
and the High Court had made observations that the allegations in the
FIR were not supported by any material during investigation whereas,
the investigation had been stayed by the High Court itself. In the said
judgment, the principles as observed in the case of Bhajan Lal
(supra) were detailed and it was also observed that the principles were
illustrative and not exhaustive.
A comprehensive reading of the above judgments would
show that the exercise of power under Section 482 CrPC for quashing
of an FIR has not been absolutely excluded where a report under
Section 173 CrPC is not filed. The said power is to be exercised
sparingly and no straitjacket formula can be laid down as to in which
situations and when the said power can be or should be exercised.
Some of the situations in which, depending upon the facts and
circumstances of the case, the said power may be exercised in spite of
the report under Section 173 CrPC having not been filed, are
illustrated hereinbelow:
i.     Where a second FIR has been registered with respect to
an incident regarding which there is already an FIR
registered, then the second FIR could be sought to be
quashed in a proceeding under Section 482 on the
principle laid down by the Hon’ble Supreme Court in
T.T. Antony (supra) and Amitbhai Anil Chandra Shah
(supra) without waiting for the report under Section 173
ii.    Where a bare reading of the FIR does not disclose the
commission of any offence. Reference may be made to
the judgment of the Hon’ble Supreme Court in Ajay
iii.   Where the FIR has been registered for offences which are
non-cognizable, then the FIR could be quashed without
waiting for the report under Section 173 Cr.P.C. as the
police would have no jurisdiction to investigate the said
offences.
iv.    Where the FIR has been registered, for offences not
exceeding three years, after the period of limitation as
provided for under Section 468 CrPC, except if saved by
any specific provision of the Code.
v.     Where the FIR has been registered in violation of any
judicial order.
vi.    Where the registration of the FIR is in violation of a
statute   or    some      principle    settled   by  judicial
pronouncement       and    the    said   violation  can   be
demonstrated from the FIR and unimpeachable material
on record.
a)     For example, a person prosecuted for an
offence for being vicariously liable without there being
any provision for vicarious criminal liability in the statute
under      which    he     is sought  to   be    prosecuted.
Reference may be made to the judgment of the Hon’ble
Supreme Court in “R. Kalyani” (supra).
b)     The FIR and its proceedings are an abuse of the process
of law and the said fact is apparent from the material
before the court as in the case of Moti Lal (supra)
wherein the Hon’ble Supreme Court had observed that a
case of suppression of material facts could amount to
playing fraud with the Court and the maxim “suppressio
veri, expression faisi” i.e suppression of the truth is
equivalent to the expression of falsehood, gets attracted.
Reference may also be made to the judgment of the
coordinate bench of this Court in Ramesh Chand
It is reiterated that the above said instances are only
enumerative and not exhaustive.
It is however, clarified that whether a case for quashing is
made out or not, even in a case where the abovesaid issues arise
would depend upon the facts and circumstances of the said case and it
cannot be stated in absolute terms that in all cases where the above
said issues arise that the FIR has to be quashed. It is further clarified
that all the necessary facts should be before the Court so as to
undisputedly raise the above issues before the Court and should not
depend upon the facts which might emerge from the report under
Adverting to the facts of the present case and after
keeping in mind the observations of the Hon’ble Supreme Court and
of various High Courts, detailed hereinabove, this Court is of the
opinion that the present FIR deserves to be quashed for the reasons
detailed hereinbelow.
A perusal of the present FIR dated 15.09.2021 would
show that the period for which the offences alleged to have been
committed is from 10.10.2019 to 15.09.2021 and the same are with
respect to two incidents. First incident being with respect to the
petitioner allegedly involving respondent No.2 in a false rape case in
the year 2019, which has been registered on the statement of          ‘R’
(name withheld) against Gurpreet Singh @ Goldy, Jagdeep Singh son
of Najar Singh and respondent no.2 and the second incident pertains
to the year 2020 involving Gurjeet Singh and one girl ‘S’ (name
withheld) and the allegation against the petitioner in the same is with
respect to demand of Rs.14 lakhs from respondent No.2, failing
which, it has been alleged that he would involve the respondent No.2
in a false rape case. It is not in dispute that the first incident in the
present FIR pertains to FIR No.263 dated 10.10.2019, registered
under Sections 376, 342, 506 and 120-B IPC and Section 8 of the
Protection of Children from Sexual Offence Act, 2012. In the said
FIR, the allegations made by the prosecutrix ‘R’ are against
respondent No.2 also. It is not in dispute that respondent No.2 had
filed an application under Section 156(3) Cr.P.C. against the said
prosecutrix ‘R’, the present petitioner and three other persons for
registration of an FIR under Sections 211, 193, 389 and 120-B IPC on
the averment that in the FIR No.263 dated 10.10.2019, the police had
found the respondent no.2 to be innocent and thus, a false case was
registered against Respndent no.2. The relevant part of the said
application dated 07.07.2020 under Section 156(3) is reproduced
“Jagdeep Singh alias Jolly, age around 30 years s/o
presently R/o Ward No.9, Lehra, Tehsil Lehra, District
1.     “R”xxxxx D/o xxx xx 2. Sarabjit Kaur W/ Amarjit
Singh 3. Kulwant Singh alias Kanti S/o Karnail Singh 4.
Lachhman Singh S/o Gurcharan Singh residents of Village
Gurmail Singh alias Mely S/o Bant Singh R/o Village
Applicant under section 156 (3) Cr.PC for
instructing SHO P.S. Lehra for registering case
U/s 211, 193, 389, 120-B IPC against the
12) That after getting registered false case against the
applicant, Gurmail Singh alias Mely had. called up my
father on phone and had said that 1 and aforesaid. accused
had in connivance got registered this false case and said
that if you will give us Rs. 14 lakhs only then we will leave
you, otherwise be ready to face its consequences. The
accused Gurmail Singh alias Mely had called up my father
on phone only after registration of case. This fact can be
cleared by taking the call recording.
13)   That   the    aforesaid   accused     in  mutual
connivance, for settling old enmity with me and by fearing
me of alleging about serious offence against me, for
extracting heavy amount from me, 04 days' after 07-10-
2019, had got registered falsely Case No. 263/2019, under a
planned conspiracy. In this connection the enquiry of the
enquiry officer who had declared me innocent is enclosed
with the application.”
Perusal of the above would show that the allegations
made in the said application under Section 156(3) Cr.P.C. pertain to
the allegations made in the first part of the present FIR. The
averments made in the said application have also been relied upon by
learned counsel for respondent No.2 while making his submissions
and it was argued by the said counsel that the allegations contained in
paragraph 7 (Page 52 of the paperbook) of the said application, would
make out a case for the registration of FIR against the present
petitioner. On 20.07.2020, Judicial Magistrate, 1st Class, Moonak after
considering the allegations made in the application under 156(3)
Cr.P.C. had observed that the Court was of the opinion that the facts
disclosed in the application did not warrant registration of an FIR. The
order dated 20.07.2020 is reproduced as under: -
Perusal of the record reveals that FIR against the
complainant was registered on the statement under Section
376 IPC and Section 8 of POCSO Act. The Court is of the
opinion that the fact disclosed in the application does not
warrant be registration of FIR. Thereby, the present
application is treated as criminal complaint and the case is
adjourned to 21.08.2020 for pre summoning evidence.
It is not in dispute that the said order had not been
challenged and has thus attained finality. The case was then fixed for
pre-summoning evidence. It would be relevant to point out that after
registration of the present FIR, the said complaint under Section
156(3) Cr.P.C. has been withdrawn, vide order dated 11.12.2021
(Annexure P-11). It is not in dispute that inspite of the said criminal
complaint being pending, respondent No.2 has chosen to file the
present complaint before the police on the basis of which, the present
FIR has been registered, without disclosing the fact with respect to the
filing of the application under Section 156(3) Cr.P.C. or the order
dated 20.07.2020. The said fact has also not been disclosed in the
alleged statement under Section 161 Cr.P.C., which was stated to have
been recorded on 16.09.2021 (Annexure R-2/3), which was referred to
by the learned counsel for respondent No.2. Even with respect to the
second incident, it is not in dispute that respondent No.2 had filed an
application under Section 156(3) Cr.P.C. against the present petitioner
and other accused. The relevant portion of the said application
(Annexure R2/1) is reproduced hereinbelow: -
Sub: Application u/s 156(3) Cr.P.C. for direction to
S.H.O., Lehra, Distt. Sangrur to register the
case against the accused 1) Buta Singh HC,
Bant Singh R/o village BakhoraKhurad, Tehsil
Lehra, Distt. Sangrur u/s 116, 195, 211, 384,
389 read with 511, 120-B of IPC.
5.    That when the complainant was exonerated
from FIR No. 263 of 10-10-2019 he was apprehensive that the
accused can again hatch any conspiracy to implicate him any
other false case so he moved applications to CM Punjab,
DGP. Punjab Police, Punjab, Chief Secretary, Punjab on 15-
10-19 stating that he is fearing that the accused may again
implicate him any false case.
6.    Then the fear of the complainant proved true
when a client namely Gurjeet Singh came to him and told
him that the was facing troubles by a lady namely “S”xxxx
W/oxxxx R/o xxxxxxxxx(withheld) who was threatening him
and demanding Rs 40000 per month as extortion money. He
told the complainant that he was already in relation with that
lady but now she had started to threaten him. So the
complainant advised him to file complaint u/s 384 against the
lady for blackmailing with police. On my advice he filed
application and the police registered an FIR no. 281 of 3-11-
2020 at Police station Lehra against the lady namely Sxxxxxx.
She was arrested on 6 11-2020 in the said case by the police
and was produced at court at Moonak She got regular bail
from the court at Moonak. Thereafter the lady Sxxxx got
registered an FIR no. 307 of 1-12-2020 police station City
Ratia u/s 376(2)(N), 384, 450, 34 of IPC. This case was
cancelled by the police after inquiry being found false.
7.     That due to close proximity with Gurjeet Singh
i.e. my client who was my classmate too I was pursuing the
matter of FIR no. 307 of 2020 which was got registered by
Sxxxx against him and for that purpose I visited Fatehabad
DSP office during inquiry of that case. I talked with
Sxxxxthere and advised her to compromise the matter then
she told me that Buta Singh HC introduced me to a Sarpanch
who arranged my bail at court at Moonak. Buta Singh HC
told her to act as per advice of Sarpanch in future and the
Sarpanch and she were having conversation on phone. Many
days they kept pressurising her for registration of the case at
Fatehabad. At that time Sarpanch was inst, gating her to file
application of rape against Jolly Advocate (Complainant)
also and told her to say that he had raped me during custody
of police. She also told the complainant that her internal
voice did not allow her to make allegations against
complainant and she told the complainant that another
person also instigated her on the instance of Sarpanch.”
Perusal of the said averments would show that
respondent No.2 sought to get an FIR registered under the same
offences under which the present FIR has been registered. Perusal of
the allegations/averments in the said application would also show that
the same are with respect to the second incident as detailed in the
present FIR. The said application was withdrawn on 22.03.2021 by
respondent No.2. The order dated 22.03.2021 is reproduced
Statement of applicant Jagdeep Singh @ Jolly
recorded qua withdrawal of the present application.
In view of the statement suffered by applicant, the
present application is hereby dismissed as withdrawn. File be
consigned to Record Room Moonak.
It is apparent from the above that even the said
application under Section 156 (3) was filed prior to the filing of
present complaint on the basis of which the present FIR was
registered. Even the said application under Section 156(3) Cr.P.C. or
the order dated 22.03.2021 has not been referred to either in the FIR
or in the alleged statement under Section 161 Cr.P.C. nor the
respondents have been able to show any document which was the
basis of the registration of the FIR, where reference of the proceedings
under Section 156(3) have been made. The Hon’ble Supreme Court in
Moti Lal Songara’s case (supra) has observed as under: -
“2. The factual score of the case in hand frescoes a
scenario and reflects the mindset of the first respondent which
would justifiably invite the statement “court is not a
laboratory where children come to play”. The action of the
accused-respondent       depicts   the   attitude    where    one
calculatedly conceives the concept that he is entitled to play a
game of chess in a court of law and the propriety, expected
norms from a litigant and the abhorrence of courts to the
issues of suppression of facts can comfortably be kept at bay.
Such a proclivity appears to have weighed uppermost in his
mind on the base that he can play in aid of technicalities to
his own advantage and the law, in its essential substance, and
justice, with its divine attributes, can unceremoniously be
buried in the grave.
18. The second limb of the submission is whether in the
obtaining factual matrix, the order passed by the High Court
discharging the accused- respondent is justified in law. We
have clearly stated that though the respondent was fully
aware about the fact that charges had been framed against
him by the learned trial Judge, yet he did not bring the same
to the notice of the revisional court hearing the revision
against the order taking cognizance. It is a clear case of
suppression. It was within the special knowledge of the
accused. Any one who takes recourse to method of
suppression in a court of law, is, in actuality, playing fraud
with the court, and the maxim supressioveri, expression faisi,
i.e., suppression of the truth is equivalent to the expression of
falsehood, gets attracted.
19. Consequently, the appeal is allowed, the order
passed by the High Court in Criminal Revision No. 327 of
2011 and the order passed by the learned Additional District
and Sessions Judge, No.1, Jodhpur, in Criminal Revision No.
7 of 2009 are set aside and it is directed that the trial which is
pending before the learned Additional District and Sessions
Judge, No. 3, Jodhpur, shall proceed in accordance with
law”.
A perusal of the above would show that the Hon’ble
Supreme Court had come down heavily on the litigants/persons who
are guilty of suppression of facts. In the said case, the accused while
challenging the summoning order under Section 319 Cr.P.C., had not
brought to the notice of the Court that the charges had been framed
against him and was successful in getting the order under Section 319
Cr.P.C. set aside, which was reversed by the Hon’ble Supreme Court.
While reversing the said order, the factum with respect to suppression
of material fact, was considered to be one of the primary grounds to
be held against the accused therein, and it was observed that anyone
who takes recourse to the method of suppressing information in a
court of law, is, in actuality, playing fraud with the court, and the
maxim supressio veri, expression faisi, i.e., suppression of the truth is
equivalent to the expression of falsehood, gets attracted.
A coordinate bench of this court in Kuldip Raj
Mahajan’s case (supra) had observed that the High Court cannot be a
helpless spectator when it is made out that the criminal prosecution is
mala fide and an abuse of the process of the court and that the High
Court has inherent power and corresponding duty to prevent the abuse
of the process of the court or otherwise to secure the ends of justice
and in the said case, the petition under Section 482 was allowed on
grounds which are akin to the present case inasmuch as, there was
concealment by the complainant in the said case as he did not disclose
in his complaint about the cancellation of the FIR despite having
knowledge of the same and the same was considered to be an
indicator of mala fide on the part of the complainant and was
considered as one of the primary grounds for quashing the
proceedings therein
The Hon’ble Supreme Court in Priyanka Srivstava case
(supra) has also held as under: -
“26. At this stage it is seemly to state that power under
Section 156(3) warrants application of judicial mind. A court of law
is involved. It is not the police taking steps at the stage of Section
154 of the code. A litigant at his own whim cannot invoke the
authority of the Magistrate. A principled and really grieved citizen
with clean hands must have free access to invoke the said power. It
protects the citizens but when pervert litigations takes this route to
harass their fellows citizens, efforts are to be made to scuttle and
curb the same.
27. In our considered opinion, a stage has come in this
country where Section 156(3) Cr.P.C. applications are to be
supported by an affidavit duly sworn by the applicant who seeks the
invocation of the jurisdiction of the Magistrate. That apart, in an
appropriate case, the learned Magistrate would be well advised to
verify the truth and also can verify the veracity of the allegations.
This affidavit can make the applicant more responsible. We are
compelled to say so as such kind of applications are being filed in a
routine manner without taking any responsibility whatsoever only to
harass certain persons. That apart, it becomes more disturbing and
alarming when one tries to pick up people who are passing orders
under a statutory provision which can be challenged under the
framework of said Act or underArticle 226 of the Constitution of
India. But it cannot be done to take undue advantage in a criminal
court as if somebody is determined to settle the scores. We have
already indicated that there has to be prior applications under
Section 154(1)and 154(3)while filing a petition under Section
156(3). Both the aspects should be clearly spelt out in the
application and necessary documents to that effect shall be filed. The
warrant for giving a direction that an application under Section
156(3) be supported by an affidavit so that the person making the
application should be conscious and also endeavour to see that no
false affidavit is made. It is because once an affidavit is found to be
false, he will be liable for prosecution in accordance with law. This
will deter him to casually invoke the authority of the Magistrate
under Section 156(3). That apart, we have already stated that the
veracity of the same can also be verified by the learned Magistrate,
regard being had to the nature of allegations of the case.”
Perusal of the above judgment would show that it was
observed by the Hon’ble Supreme Court that the exercise of power
under Section 156(3) Cr.P.C. warrants application of judicial mind as
a court of law is involved and the said proceedings are on a higher
footing than the proceedings under Section 154 Cr.P.C. It was further
observed that in the application under Section 156(3)Cr.P.C., it was
necessary to spell out that the application under Sections 154(1) and
154(3) Cr.P.C. has been filed before filing the petition under Section
156(3) Cr.P.C. Even supporting affidavit was required to be
submitted. The copy of the said judgment was circulated to all the
High Courts for further circulation to the Sessions Judges and to the
Magistrates. Once, in the application under Section 156(3)Cr.P.C., it
was found incumbent to mention about the filing of application before
the police, it would be equally incumbent, rather, the higher duty of
the complainant to mention about the application under Section
156(3) Cr.P.C. filed and the orders thereof, in the complaint before the
police on the basis of which the FIR has been registered, when the
complaint before the police is subsequent to the application filed
under Section 156(3) Cr.P.C. In the present case, the same has
admittedly not been done and the same amounts to suppression of a
material fact. As earlier noticed hereinbefore, vide order dated
20.07.2020, it had been noticed by the Judicial Magistrate, 1st Class,
Moonak in the application under Section 156(3) Cr.P.C. that the
allegations made in the complaint did not warrant registration of an
FIR and thus, the subsequent registration of the present FIR is in
violation of the order passed by the Judicial Magistrate, 1st Class,
Moonak. In fact, both the applications under Section 156(3) Cr.P.C.
have been dismissed as withdrawn. In the first application under
Section 156(3) Cr.P.C. observations had come against respondent
No.2 and thus, it seems that instead of pursuing his complaint or
challenging the order dated 20.07.2020, respondent No.2 had got the
present FIR registered. The said act of Respondent no.2 amounts to
forum shopping. Moreover, police officials cannot be permitted to act
in violation of judicial orders or judicial proceedings. The registration
of the present FIR is thus, illegal on the said account also in addition
to there being active concealment of suppression of material facts and
thus, deserves to be quashed on each of the said grounds.
Another important aspect of the present case is that the
allegations in the FIR are to the effect that in the FIR registered in the
year 2019 with respect to the prosecutrix ‘R’, the respondent No.2 had
been found to be innocent by the police and thus, the said FIR is false
as far as respondent No.2 is concerned, also would have no legs to
stand on inasmuch as, the said prosecutrix ‘R’ has appeared in the
witness box in the proceedings in FIR No.263 dated 10.10.2019 as
PW1 on 17.08.2021 and has levelled allegations against respondent
No.2 and an application dated 24.08.2021 had been filed under
Section 319 Cr.P.C. against respondent No.2 on the basis of the
evidence given by the prosecutrix ‘R’. The said application has been
allowed vide order dated 01.12.2021. The relevant portion of the said
order (Annexure P-9) is hereinunder: -
Gurpreet Singh and others
R/W 6 Prevention of Children from Sexual Offences
Application U/s 319 Cr.P.C. for summoning
Jagdeep Singh @ Jolly son of Hargopal Singh,
R/o Bakhora Khurd to face trial along with the
xxx    xxx      xxx  xxx    xxx     xxx     xxx
8. Keeping in view the observation, made above, this
Court is satisfied that the evidence on record against the
accused, proposed to be summoned, is too strong and cogent
to make out more than prima facie case required for framing
of charge but short of satisfaction to the extent that if it goes
unrebutted, would lead to conviction. Accordingly, the
application is allowed. Accused Jagdeep Singh @ Jolly son
of Hargopal Singh resident of Bakhora Khurd is ordered to
be summoned to face trial under sections 363, 376 (D), and
384 Indian Penal Code, along with the other accused for
Perusal of the above order would show that respondent
No.2 has been summoned in order to face trial under Sections 363,
376(D) and 384 of the IPC along with the other accused. Since
respondent No.2 has been summoned under Section 319 Cr.P.C. after
considering the evidence of the prosecutrix and also the fact that
respondent No.2 had been given a clean chit by the police, the clean
chit given by the police loses its significance and thus, the foundation
laid down by respondent No.2 for the registration of the said FIR
would have no legs to stand on.
A Coordinate Bench of this Court in “Ramesh Chand
Vs. State of Haryana”, reported as 2006 (4) RCR (Cr) 718 had
observed as under: -
“Petitioner Ramesh Chand has filed this petition under
Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure for quashing
of the kalandra submitted by the police of Police Station
Nissang, District Karnal, against him under Section 182
Indian Penal Code and the consequent proceedings.
2. In this case, on a complaint made by the petitioner,
FIR No. 31 dated 1.2.1999 was registered at Police Station
Nissang under Section 379 Indian Penal Code against Sona
Devi and her son Balbir alias Dalbir. In the complaint, it was
alleged that Smt. Sona Devi, the then Sarpanch of Gram
Panchayat, Village Amunpur, with the help of certain persons
have cut trees standing on the panchayat land. Subsequently,
during the investigation, the police found the allegations to be
false. Consequently, the aforesaid FIR was got cancelled.
Thereafter, the police submitted impugned kalandra under
Section 182 Indian Penal Code against the petitioner for
initiating proceeding against him for giving false information
to the police.
3. It is the case of the petitioner that after cancellation
of the aforesaid FIR, he filed a private complaint under
sections 379, 201, 467, 468, 471 and 120B Indian Penal Code
against Sona Devi and others, wherein, after recording
preliminary evidence, the trial Court has summoned the
accused persons to face trial under Section 379 Indian Penal
Code. Copies of the complaint and the summoning order have
been placed on record as Annexures P-2 and P-3. The said
complaint is still pending. In view of this fact, counsel for the
petitioner submits that once on the complaint filed by the
petitioner on the same allegations, the accused have been
summoned, the proceedings initiated against him by the
police under Section 182 Indian Penal Code for giving them
false information are abuse of process of law and are liable
to be quashed.
4. Counsel for the respondent-State has not disputed
the filing of the private complaint by the petitioner against the
accused on the similar allegations as well as the summoning
of the accused in the said complaint by the trial Court. The
pendency of the complaint is also not disputed.
5. This Court in Crl. Misc. No. 18769-M of 2005,
decided on September 13, 2006, while following the
judgments of the Supreme Court in Gopal Vijay Verma v.
Bhuneshwar Prasad Sinha, 1982(3) SCC 510 and H.S.
Bains v. State (Union Territory of Chandigarh), AIR 1980
Supreme Court 1883 and a Division Bench decision of the
Patna High Court in Munilal Thakur and others v. Nawal
Kishore Thakur and another, 1985 Criminal Law Journal
437, has held that a Magistrate, even after accepting the final
report after hearing the complainant, can still take
cognizance of the offence upon a complaint on same or
similar allegations of fact.
6. In view of the admitted facts that in the private
complaint filed by the petitioner, the accused have been
summoned, though they were found innocent by the police in
the FIR and keeping in view the aforesaid settled proposition
of law, at this stage it cannot be said that the allegations
levelled by the petitioner in the FIR are false. Therefore, in
my opinion, the proceedings initiated by the police against
the petitioner under Section 182 Indian Penal Code are liable
to be quashed.
7. Resultantly, the instant petition is allowed. The
kalandra submitted by the police of Police Station Nissang,
District Karnal, against the petitioner under Section 182
Indian Penal Code and the consequent proceedings are
quashed.”
A perusal of the above judgment would show that a
petition under Section 482 was allowed and the proceedings under
Section 182 CrPC were quashed on the ground that after the police
had found the case registered by the petitioner therein to be false and
submitted a cancellation report and initiated proceeding under Section
182 IPC against the petitioner therein, on a complaint filed by the
complainant/petitioner     therein      the accused   person  had   been
summoned and it was thus, observed that since the complaint was
pending, thus, the proceeding under Section 182 IPC were liable to be
quashed. The law laid down in the above-said judgment would apply
on all fours to the present case.
This Court has also considered the fact, as highlighted by
learned counsel for petitioner, that respondent No.2 has been filing
one application after the other in order to influence the prosecutrix ‘R’
in the case and in order to pressurize her not to give statement against
respondent No.2. Initially, the proceedings under Section 182 Cr.P.C.
were sought to be initiated against prosecutrix ‘R’, which was not
initiated against her on account of the opinion given by the Deputy
DA, Sangrur, which has been annexed as Annexure P-4 with the
present petition. The second attempt was made by moving an
application under Section 156(3) Cr.P.C. dated 07.07.2020 (the
relevant portion of which has been reproduced hereinabove), in which
the said prosecutrix was arrayed as accused No.1 and the present
petitioner was also made accused No.5 and in the said case, the
Judicial Magistrate, 1st Class, Moonak had observed on 20.07.2020
(relevant portion has been reproduced hereinabove) that the same did
not warrant registration of an FIR. Third attempt has been made, in
which, an application was sought to be filed through the said
prosecutrix, in which certain averments were made in favour of
respondent No.2 (Annexure R-2/4), even contrary to the evidence
which had been given by the prosecutrix before the Court on
17.08.2021 (Annexure P-7). The said application/complaint was
withdrawn on 18.11.2021. Learned counsel for the petitioner has
highlighted that the registration of the present FIR on 15.09.2021 was
the fourth attempt made, as respondent No.2 had an understanding
that the present petitioner might be able to influence the prosecutrix in
withdrawing the application under Section 319 Cr.P.C. in the
proceeding of FIR No.263 dated 10.10.2019. To support this
argument, it was highlighted that on 17.08.2021, the prosecutrix ‘R’
had given her evidence against respondent No.2 on the basis of which,
an application dated 24.08.2021 was filed under Section 319 Cr.P.C.
for summoning respondent No.2 and it is thereafter, the present FIR
has been registered on 15.09.2021. The said act and conduct of
respondent No.2 also shows that registration of the FIR is an abuse of
the process of the Court and respondent No.2 has indulged in forum
shopping and has got present FIR registered with the mala-fide intent
and with an ulterior motive of taking vengeance on the petitioner with
whom even as per his own version he has enmity. The present petition
thus, deserves to be quashed.
Certain other factors are also sought to be highlighted as
the same would also substantiate the reasons detailed above for
allowing the present petition for quashing the FIR.
The present FIR has been registered under Sections 384,
506 and 511 IPC. The allegations on the basis of which Section 506
IPC has been sought to be added in the FIR is to the effect that the
petitioner in connivance with other persons were demanding Rs.14
lakhs from the complainant and threatened that if the said amount was
not given, then, a false rape case will be got registered against
respondent No.2. Apparently it seems that it is the said alleged threat
which as per respondent No.2 and the police, constitutes the offence
under Section 506 IPC. A Co-ordinate Bench of this Court in the case
titled “Surinder Suri Vs. State of Haryana and others, reported as
1996(2) R.C.R. (Criminal) 701, has held as under: -
“This is a petition under Section 482 of the Criminal
Procedure Code filed by Surinder Suri and Ramesh Kumar
sons of Kimti Lal whereby they have prayed for the quashing
of FIR No. 297 dated 4.8.1995 under Sections 506/34 of the
Indian Penal Code, P.S. City Jagadhri and the resultant
proceedings thereof pending before Ms. Sarita Gupta,
xxx   xxx    xxx       xxx xxx    xxx
14.   According to the allegations set out in FIR No.
297 dated 4.8.1995 under section 506/34 of the Indian Penal
Code by Pawan Kumar, on 2.8.1995 at about 7.00 P.M., he
alongwith Bhusan and Ajit Kumar were passing through
HUDA Colony, Jagadhri. He was driving scooter ahead of
Bhusan and Ajit Kumar. They were behind him. Surinder Suri
and his brother Ramesh came there all of sudden. Surinder
Suri was driving scooter and his brother Ramesh Kumar was
sitting on the pillion. They slowed down their scooter and
came there. They threatened to kill him and abused him.
They further threatened that in future if he published any
news against them, he would be eliminated. In the meantime,
Bhusan and Ajit also came near him. Thereupon, Surinder
Suri and Ramesh Kumar sped away their scooter. Pawan
Kumar is a Press Reporter feeding news to Punjab Kesri.
Pawan Kumar, Bhusan and Ajit went to their house and
narrated the occurrence to Pawan Kumar's brother. They
reached police Station, City Jagadhri at 10.00 P.M. where
ASI Amarnath met them. He was in civilian dress. He told
them that if they reported the matter at the police station, they
would have to face the consequences.
16.     Court while considering the question of
quashing of the first information report, has to see the
malafides of the complainant, if there be any. If dominant
purpose in filing the first information report is malafide,
FIR would have to be quashed. This view was taken by the
Full Bench of the Delhi High Court in M/s Neelam
Mahajan Singh v. Commissioner of Police and others,
1994(2) CLR 181. Article 226 of the Constitution confers
extraordinary jurisdiction on the High Court to issue
appropriate writ, order or direction as may be necessary in
the administration of justice. This is a wide discretionary
power. Similarly, the High Court has wide inherent powers
under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. This
power is, however, to be exercised with certain amount of
circumspection and with utmost care and caution. Section
503 of the Indian Penal Code defines criminal intimidation as
"Whoever threatens another with any injury to his
person, reputation or property, or to the person or reputation
of any one in whom that person is interested, with intent to
cause alarm to that person, or to cause that person to do any
act which he is not legally bound to do, or to omit to do any
act which that person is legally entitled to do, as the means of
avoiding the execution of such threat, commits criminal
intimidation.
Explanation - A threat to injure the reputation of any
deceased person in whom the person threatened is interested,
is within this section."
17. If we carefully go through the provisions of Section
503 of the Indian Penal Code, I do not think the allegations
made by Pawan Kumar on the basis of which FIR No. 297
dated 4.81995 was registered will satisfy the ingredients of
Section 503 of the Indian Penal Code. The gist of the offence
is the effect which the threat is intended to have upon the
mind of the person threatened. The threat must be one which
can be put into execution by the person threatening. A threat,
in order to be indictable must be made with intent to cause
alarm to the complainant. As for instance mere vague
allegation by the accused that he is going to take revenge by
false complaints cannot amount to criminal intimidation.
xxx   xxx    xxx      xxx xxx    xxx
I am equally alive that criminal prosecution should
be quashed in exercise of these powers by this Court if the
intention of the complainant is malicious and is to wreak
vengeance on the accused and to spite him due to private
and personal grudge and not to vindicate the law for the
good of the society.
19. For the reasons given above, this petition is
accepted and FIR No. 297 dated 4.8.1995 under section
506/34 of the Indian Penal Code registered at Police Station
City Jagadhri together with the proceedings consequential
thereto pending before the Judicial Magistrate Ist Class,
Jagadhri is quashed.”
A perusal of the above judgment would show that in the
said case, petitioner/accused therein had come close to the
complainant while riding the scooter and threatened to kill him and
abused him and further threatened that in future if the complainant
therein, would publish any news article against them, the said
complainant would be eliminated. Even in the said situation, a Co-
ordinate Bench held that the mere vague allegations by the accused
that he was going to take revenge by filing false complaints cannot
amount to criminal intimidation. It was further observed that in case,
the dominant purpose in filing the FIR is malafide then the FIR would
have to be quashed and reliance had been placed upon the judgment of
a Full Bench of the Delhi High Court in M/s Neelam Mahajan Singh
vs. Commissioner of Police and others, 1994(2) CLR 181. In
Kuldeep Raj Mahajan’s case (supra), the reproduction of the relevant
portion of which has been made hereinbefore, the petitioner therein
had extended threat to the life of the respondent and a Co-ordinate
Bench of this Court had noticed in para No.11 of the judgment that an
alleged empty threat, to implicate the respondent in false cases or to
get him removed from service, would not constitute the offence of
criminal intimidation punishable under Section 506 IPC. It was further
observed that the allegations in the complaint therein would not make
out a case of criminal intimidation and accordingly, the proceedings
were quashed. Another Co-ordinate Bench of this Court in case titled
as “Makam H.A. Vs. State of Haryana and another, 2013(11) R.C.R.
(Criminal) 370, has held as under: -
5. Counsel for the petitioner had made reference to
the Section 384 I.P.C. to urge that it would not at all be
attracted. Counsel would also contend that even if it is
accepted that some threatening call is made to the
complainant, it would not reveal an offence as such threat
was not advanced in the immediate presence of the
complainant or on face to face basis.
As per the allegation, the petitioner had threatened
the complainant that he had links with LTTE and will get his
house blasted by putting RDX. He is alleged to have used
some filthy abuses, which of course are not mentioned in the
complaint or the FIR. He has made Anirudh Aggarwal as his
witness as the other call was received in his presence.
8. Whether a call given on telephone from such a
remote place with potential threat would attract Section 506
I.P.C. is a question and out of blew the police has added
offence under Section 384 I.P.C. making the case of extortion
against the petitioner, which is without any justification.
xxx   xxx     xxx      xxx     xxx     xxx
10. Section 384 I.P.C. provides punishment for
extortion. The extortion is defined in Section 383 I.P.C. as
" Whosoever intentionally puts any person in fear of
any injury to that person, or to any other, and thereby
dishonestly induces the person so put in fear to deliver to any
person any property or valuable security, or anything signed
or sealed which may be converted into a valuable security,
commits extortion".
Accordingly, no offence under Section 384 I.P.C.
would be made out against the petitioner, from the perusal
and even reading of FIR in a best possible manner, I
wonder how the trial Court has framed the charge under
Section 384 I.P.C. To an extent, it would reflect non-
application of mind.
12.   The other offence alleged against the petitioner
is under Sections 504 and 506 I.P.C. Section 504 I.P.C.
punishes an intentional insult with intent to provoke breach of
the peace. As per the State counsel, Section 504 I.P.C. would
be attracted to the facts of the case as the petitioner had used
abusive language on telephone call that he gave to the
respondent. The Section, however, apparently is providing for
some different situation. This Section provides that,
whosoever     intentionally       insults,    and  thereby  gives
provocation to any person, intending or knowing it to be
likely that such provocation will cause him to breach of the
public peace, would be guilty of offence under this Section. It
is not even alleged that the word, which was used by the
petitioner, was with intention to provoke the complainant to
indulge in breach of peace. In my view, the offence under
Section 504 I.P.C. would also not be attracted as per the
allegations made in the FIR.
13.    So far as the charge of criminal intimidation is
concerned, this also, apparently, is too remote. The person
giving telephone call from Mumbai would hardly be in any
position to advance any effective threat at such a far off
place. Apparently, there was business transaction between the
petitioner and complainant and mere receipt of call would not
mean that use of words as alleged in the FIR stands proved.
In this regard, except for the evidence of the complainant,
nothing else would be there to support the allegation. The
submission that the conversation was in the presence of other
witness would again be not worthy of reliance as telephonic
call between two persons can hardly be heard by any person
even if he is present in vicinity. In my view, the allegations
against the petitioner have been stretched. No offence against
the petitioner for the offences alleged is made out.
xxx    xxx    xxx      xxx   xxx    xxx
15. The present petition is, accordingly, allowed. FIR
No. 1099 dated 21.10.2009 registered under Sections 384,
504 and 506 I.P.C. at Police Station City Panipat and all
subsequent proceedings arising therefrom are hereby
quashed.”
A perusal of the above judgment would show that in the
said case the FIR had been registered under Sections 384, 504 and 506
IPC. As per the allegations in the FIR therein, the petitioner/accused
therein had threatened the complainant therein by stating that he had
links with LTTE and would get his house blasted by putting RDX and
also used filthy language against him. It was further alleged that the
telephonic call, which was made was in the presence of one witness. It
was observed by the Co-ordinate Bench, that a call given on telephone
from a remote place, would not give rise to the offence under Section
506 IPC as the person giving a telephonic call, is hardly in a position
to advance any effective threat. Even with respect to the offence
under Section 384 IPC, it was observed that the said offence was not
made out.
In the present case, there is no overt act alleged in the
FIR and it has only been vaguely stated that the petitioner is
threatening to implicate respondent No.2 in a false rape case and thus,
as per the law laid by the above-said judgments and also, as per the
settled principles of law, the provision of Section 506 IPC would not
be attracted even in case, the allegations levelled in the FIR are taken
on its face value. Even with respect to the offence of extortion/attempt
to extort, it is apparent that the allegations are far-fetched and with
respect to the second incident, no alleged false case has been
registered even till date and thus, the question of seeking money is too
far-fetched. In case on the basis of such allegations, an FIR is
registered, then, it would be very easy for any person to implicate
another person by merely making vague allegations, moreso, when
there is previous enmity between the parties. Thus, as per the opinion
of this Court, the present FIR registered under Sections 506, 384 and
511 IPC has no legs to stand on. It would be relevant to mention that
while deciding the present case and holding that the present FIR
deserves to be quashed, the entire material, which was required for the
adjudication of the present case, was before this Court and it could not
be said that the facts were incomplete so as to await the report under
Accordingly, the present petition is allowed and the FIR
No.236 dated 15.09.2021 (Annexure P-1), under Sections 384, 511
and 506 IPC, registered at Police Station Lehra, District Sangrur as
well as subsequent proceedings emanating therefrom, are quashed qua
the petitioner.
