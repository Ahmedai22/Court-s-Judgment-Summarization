Heard the learned counsel for the petitioner.
This  petition  is  filed   by   the   petitioner  for  transfer  of
Complaint No. 3105 of 2021 titled as “Vishal Mahajan vs. Dinesh
Mahajan” filed under Sections 420 and 506 of the Indian Penal Code
pending in the Court of Chief Judicial Magistrate, Jammu to Tis
In Ground ‘D’    of the Transfer Petition, an apprehension of
threat of life merely on receiving notice on the above-mentioned
complaint, has been shown.                  No complaint has been lodged by the
petitioner to the authorities concerned or before any Court.
of  threat  of  life    is   not  a  sufficient  ground  to
transfer a case, without lodging a complaint or substantiating the
said ground.
The  learned  counsel  appearing     on  behalf   of  the  petitioner
prays  for  exemption  from  personal      appearance   by  relying  on  a
judgment titled “Puneet Dalmia vs. Central Bureau of Investigation,
Hyderabad” reported in 2020 12 SCC 695, inter-alia contending that
exemption from personal appearance may be granted.         Considering the
facts  of  the  said  case  (Puneet     Dalmia   vs.   Central  Bureau  of
Investigation, Hyderabad supra), in which the exemption was refused
by the Court and as prayed for by the petitioner, this Court while
considering the facts and circumstances of the said case, granted
exemption from personal appearance.
The order passed by this Court in Puneet Dalmia vs. Central
Bureau of Investigation, Hyderabad (supra) does not apply in the
instant transfer petition merely on the basis of apprehension.
In view of the afore-said, this Court does not find any ground
to transfer the Complaint No. 3105 of 2021 pending in the Court of
Chief Judicial Magistrate, Jammu to Tis Hazari Courts, Delhi.
The transfer petition is, accordingly, dismissed.
Pending application(s), if any, stand disposed of.
