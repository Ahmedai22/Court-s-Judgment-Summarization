1.              By invoking Section 374 of the Code of Criminal
Procedure, appellants, who are the original accused Nos. 1 to 3
have taken exception to the Judgment and Order of conviction
passed by the learned District Judge – 7 & Additional Sessions
Judge, Nashik dated 08.06.2015 in Sessions Case No. 142 of
2013, thereby convicting them for the offences punishable under
Sections 302 r/w 34, 323 r/w 34, 324 r/w 34 of the Indian Penal
Code ( for short ‘IPC’ ) & sentencing them to life, 3 years, 1 year
respectively.
2.              The complainant, his sons and accused Nos. 1 to 4 are
agriculturists and also relatives of each other. Their lands were
adjoining to each other. Due to shortage of water, complainant
fetched/drew water from Pazar Talav (Percolation Tank).
Accused used to prevent the same. This resulted into bitter
relations.
3.              On 06.12.2012, one of the sons of the complainant
namely Dattu and his wife went to fetch water. Another son
Raghunath also went to look for them and the complainant
claims to have followed all of them to the spot. According to the
complainant, accused persons assaulted Dattu with sickle and
they assaulted him and his son Raghunath with stick and sickle
respectively and all injured were taken to the hospital. There he
set law into motion. Dattu expired.
After     completion   of      investigation,            PW.11
charge-sheeted all the four accused persons and on committal of
the case, it was tried by the learned Additional Sessions Judge,
who on appreciating the evidence held accused Nos. 1 to 3 to be
guilty of offence under Section 302, 323 and 324 r/w 34 of the
IPC and acquitted accused No. 4 Rani from all charges. It is this
order of conviction which is now questioned before this Court on
various grounds raised in Appeal Memo.
4.              Heard extensively both sides. Learned counsel would
challenge the fndings reached by the learned trial Judge on the
following grounds.
Firstly :- Failure of the learned trial Judge to appreciate the
evidence on record in the light of legal requirements.
Secondly :- Testimonies of PW.3, PW.4 & PW.5 are not consistent
and that PW.3 cannot be said to be eye witness.
Thirdly :- No evidence as to whether accused to be armed at the
time of occurrence. Rather complainant party had assaulted
accused partly.
Fourthly :- Overt act of accused persons is not defned.
Fifthly :- There being single blow to deceased. It is not the case
of homicidal death.
5.              Learned APP would resist on the ground that there is
direct, trustworthy and reliable evidence, including that of
injured      eye      witness account. Medical     evidence         suggests
homicidal death of Dattu. Defence admitted injuries suffered by
PW.3 – complainant & PW.5 – Raghunath. Consequently, there
being incriminating material, learned trial Court rightly accepted
prosecution version & held accused guilty. According to him,
there being no merit in Appeal, the same may be dismissed.
6.              In view of Judgment of Hon’ble Apex Court in the
case of Ishwarbhai Fujibhai Patni Vs. State of Gujarat , reported
in (1995) 1 SCC (Cri.) 222, this being Appellate Court, evidence
has to be re-examined, re-assessed and re-evaluated. Hence, we
accordingly proceed to do so.
7.              The evidence goes to show that on said fateful night,
deceased went with his wife – PW.4 to fetch water. Taking into
account, the evidence of PW.3 – complainant, it is clear that after
deceased & PW.4, his other son Raghunath i. e. PW.5 went to the
spot. Therefore, complainant was the last person to reach the
spot. Hence, it is doubtful whether he had occasion to see the
entire episode. Further, his evidence is general & non-specifc
about the roles played by accused Nos. 1 to 3. Hence, we refrain
from relying his testimony.
8.              On        carefully scrutinizing      the      evidence            of
PW.4 & PW.5, the occurrence gets unfolded. PW.4 was in the
company of deceased from inception. Hence, her evidence
assumes importance. Similarly, evidence of PW.5 Raghunath is
also relevant, as he too is an injured.
9.              On minute examination of evidence of PW.4 & PW.5, it
is emerging that accused Murlidhar assaulted deceased Dattu
with sickle in stomach, whereas accused Nos. 2 & 3 assaulted
PW.5 and complainant – PW.3. Both these witnesses are silent
about any overtact by accused Nos. 2 & 3 on the person of
deceased Dattu.
However, it seems that accused Nos. 2 & 3                   are
charge-sheeted by invoking Section 34 of the IPC. In our opinion,
to attract the mischief of Section 34, two things are essential i. e.
frstly, common intention to commit offence and secondly,
participation in commission of offence. The words “infurtherance
of common intention of all” are most essential parts of this
provision. It is the common intention to commit crime actually
committed. It pre-supposes a state of mind common to all
accused to commit crime, which may develop at the eleventh
hour, just before or during course of the crime or sometime
before. As it is of mind, it has to be ascertained from the
surrounding circumstances, and, therefore, role played by each
of the accused helps considerably in determining the aspect of
common intention.
Here evidence on record is completely silent about
the role allegedly played by accused Nos. 2 & 3 in assaulting
deceased Dattu.
10.             PW.7, a Medico-legal Expert has clearly opined about
death of Dattu due to assault by sickle. Sickle is recovered at the
instance of accused No. 1. Taking into account the evidence of
PW.4 & PW.5 which is direct and consistent evidence and
evidence of Medico-legal Expert, it can safely be inferred that
ocular account lends support to medical evidence as regards
homicidal death is concerned. Therefore, in the light of above
discussion, it is evident that only accused No. 1 having assaulted
in stomach, which resulted into death is liable and answerable for
homicidal death of Dattu.
In the light of aforesaid discussion on the point of
applicability of Section 34 of the IPC, here evidence is missing
regarding participation and common intention entertained and
shared by accused Nos.2 & 3. Hence, they cannot be roped in for
offence punishable under Section 302 of the IPC by invoking
Section 34 of the IPC.
11.             As regards to injuries on PW.3 & PW.5 are concerned,
defence has already admitted Exh. 45 in trial Court. Therefore,
there is no serious challenge to injuries on PW.3 & PW.5.
Consequently, charge under Sections 323 & 324 of the IPC is
made out by the prosecution.
12.             To sum up, here it is manifest from the evidence on
record that accused No. 1 Murlidhar is the sole author of single
injury on deceased Dattu. Injury is on vital part like abdomen.
There is said to be use of sickle. Measurement of the
injury/wound is narrated by the Autopsy Doctor and is also
refected in the Post Mortem Report. The deceased succumbed on
the same day and therefore, there is no hesitation to hold that
though, there was a single blow, it was with immense force and
has resulted into death.
13.             It is strenuously submitted before us by learned
counsel for the Appellants that here there is single blow on
deceased Dattu and therefore, Section 302 of the IPC is not
attracted.
We are not impressed with such submissions. It is
settled law that mere fact that there was single blow, is not a
circumstance which would warrant conviction under Section
302 of the IPC, being altered to one punishable under Section
304(Part II) of the IPC. There are several cases, where single
blow has also resulted in death and has attracted charge under
Section 302 of the IPC. The fact that single blow is inficted by
itself would not mitigate the offence to one culpable homicide not
amounting to murder.
In series of Judgments like in the cases of Virsa Singh
Vs. State of Punjab, Gudar Dusadh Vs. State of Bihar, Vasanta Vs.
State of Maharashtra, Jai Prakash Vs. State (Delhi Admn.) and
State of Karnataka Vs. Vedanayagam, the Hon’ble Apex Court
lucidly and succinctly has dealt with law on this point i. e. in
cases involving single blow resulting into death, thereby
attracting offence of murder.
Here      also as  discussed       above,      taking         into
consideration nature of weapon, site of the body targeted, we are
of the considered opinion that said blow though single, has
turned out to be fatal. Consequently, accused No. 1 Murlidhar,
alone being author of said injury, he is solely responsible and
rightly held guilty so by the learned trial Judge.
For the aforesaid reasons, guilt of accused Nos. 2 & 3
for charge under Section 302 of the IPC, is in the absence of
participation and sharing common intention. Hence, their
conviction for the charge under Secion 302 of the IPC is
misplaced and they are required to be acquitted from the said
charge. Thus, we propose to interfere in the trial Court’s order
only to that extent.
Resultantly, we proceed to pass the following order.
(i)             The Appeal is partly allowed;
(ii)            The Judgment and Order of conviction passed by the
learned District Judge – 7 & Additional Sessions Judge, Nashik
as against accused No. 1 alone for the offence punishable under
Section 302 of the IPC is maintained and kept intact;
(iii)           The Judgment and Order of conviction of accused
Nos. 2 & 3 for the offence punishable under Section 302 r/w 34 of
the IPC is quashed & set aside;
(iv)            Conviction and sentence against accused Nos. 2 & 3
for the commission of offence punishable under Sections 323 &
324 r/w 34 of the IPC passed by the learned trial Judge is
maintained and kept intact.
14.             The Appeal is disposed of accordingly.
