By way of the present petition under section 11 of the
Arbitration & Conciliation Act 1996 (‘A&C Act’ for short), the
petitioner seeks appointment of an arbitrator to adjudicate upon the
disputes that are stated to have arisen with the respondent from
Agreement dated 02.05.2014 (‘Agreement’ for short), which related
to the sale, implementation and installation by the petitioner of certain
hardware and multi-media system accessories along with software for
the purpose of setting-up 24 Smart Learn Classes at several schools
run by the respondents.
2.      Notice on this petition was issued on 25.01.2022.
Signing Date:28.09.2022 Arb. P. 91/2022                                                        Page 1 of 9
3.      Mr. Zeeshan Hashmi, learned counsel for the petitioner has drawn the
attention of this court to clause 11 of the Agreement which comprises
the arbitration agreement between the parties; and contemplates
reference of disputes between them to arbitration; with courts of law
at New Delhi to have exclusive jurisdiction over disputes that so arise.
4.      Although reply is stated to have been filed by the respondents, the
same is not on record. A copy of the reply has been handed-up by
learned counsel appearing for the respondents in court, which is taken
on record.
5.      Learned counsel for the respondents submits that their principal
objection to the reference of disputes to arbitration is that the claims
made by the petitioner, of which reference is sought, are ex-facie
time-barred.
6.      It is submitted on behalf of the respondents that the disputes between
the parties have arisen from Agreements dated 02.05.2014,
31.03.2015, 30.05.2015 and 06.06.2016, all of which related to the
setting-up of Smart Learn Classes at the respondents’ schools, as
referred to above.
7.      All else apart, learned counsel appearing for the respondents points-
out that, on their own admission, the petitioner invoked arbitration
vide notice dated 28.07.2021 issued to the respondents, in which
notice the petitioner itself set-out the following claims and also
indicated the time when the said claims became due:
“5. However, once Our Client had delivered the hardware and
installed the SLC's you started delaying payment instalments. Further,
You the Noticees again misrepresented and gave false assurances that
the said delay (sic) Therefore, the outstanding amount pending to be

recovered from you the Noticees by our Client is Rs. 29,28,100
Only) Alongwith Interest @ 18% P.A. till the date of actual
realisation/payment.
“6. Our Client had sent Legal Notice dated 04.01.2017 and a reminder
notice dated 24.03.2017 for the recovery of outstanding dues. Further,
Our Client has sent an Intimation Notice dated 22.08.2017 before the
initiation of the judicial proceedings to you the Noticee.
“7. A dispute has arisen between you and Our Client, due to the fact
that you the Noticee have completely failed to fulfil your
obligations/liabilities with respect to the payment to be made to Our
Client as per the terms and conditions of the Agreements. You have
therefore, completely failed to perform your contractual obligations
which have caused irreparable harm to Our Client's reputation and
goodwill. You have further failed to clear the mounting outstanding
debt of Rs. 29,28,100 (Rupees Twenty Nine Lakhs Eight Thousand
One Hundred Only) alongwith interest @ 18% P.A. till the date of
actual Realisation/Payment inspite of repeated reminders and various
settlement talks.”
8.      It is further submitted, that it is admittedly the petitioner’s case, that
by legal notice dated 04.01.2017, the petitioner terminated agreement
dated 02.05.2014 (in addition to Agreements dated 01.05.2015 and
01.06.2015) with the respondents; and, as narrated in para 6 of the
invocation notice, the petitioner also sent reminder notices dated
24.03.2017 and 22.08.2017 to the respondents. However, the present
petition under section 11 of the A&C Act has come to be filed only on
19/21.01.2022, which was well beyond the 03-year limitation
provided for the petitioner to seek recovery of monetary dues.
9.      The respondents argue that to invocation notice dated 28.07.2021,
they issued reply dated 31.08.2021, wherein they disputed and denied
the claims made by the petitioner; and though in reply dated
Signing Date:28.09.2022 Arb. P. 91/2022                                                              Page 3 of 9
31.08.2021, the respondents did say that irrespective of the nature of
the disputes “…if your client proposed for appoint any one arbitrator
near to the locality of my clients area they agree for give their consent
for appoint an arbitrator to resolve the dispute…”, that in itself
would not extend the period of limitation for the petitioner to seek
remedy for recovery of its alleged claims.
10.     In response to the objection taken, learned counsel for the petitioner
has urged that, as is evident from Annexure-3 to Agreement dated
31.03.2015, the schedule of payments for the respondents to pay for
the hardware extended upto May 2018; and furthermore, that in para
11 of reply dated 31.08.2021 issued by the respondents, they have
admitted that the hardware in question was lying in the premises of
the respondents until 2019 in the following words:
“11. My clients states that your client representatives unlawfully entered
into my clients school premises in the year 2019 and took all the Hardwar
(sic) and Multimedia accessories from my client school without the
permission and consent of my clients. The act of your client's
representatives would put my clients into great mental depression and
worries and it will spoil the reputation of my clients school. Your clients
had not acted upon the agreements entered into between your client and
my clients.”
Learned counsel for the petitioner places reliance on the 03-
year limitation period prescribed in Article 137 of the Limitation Act,
1963 to urge that since the petitioner’s money claims against the
respondents are founded inter-alia on the recovery of hardware from
the respondents, the claims sought to be referred are within limitation.
11.     In support of its submissions, the petitioner has cited decisions of Co-
ordinate Benches of this court in Huawei Telecommunications
Signing Date:28.09.2022 Arb. P. 91/2022                                                             Page 4 of 9
(India) Co. Pvt Ltd & Anr vs. WIPRO Ltd 1 (para 32) and GAIL
(India) Ltd vs. Rathi Steel and Power Ltd2 (para 14).
12.      On the other hand, learned counsel for the respondents has placed
reliance upon the decision of the Hon’ble Supreme Court in BSNL &
Anr vs. Nortel Networks India Pvt. Ltd 3 inter-alia drawing attention
to paras 47 and 51 of that judgment, which read as follows:
“47. It is only in the very limited category of cases, where there is not
even a vestige of doubt that the claim is ex facie time-barred, or that the
dispute is non-arbitrable, that the court may decline to make the
reference. However, if there is even the slightest doubt, the rule is to refer
the disputes to arbitration, otherwise it would encroach upon what is
essentially a matter to be determined by the tribunal.
“51. The period of limitation for issuing notice of arbitration would not
get extended by mere exchange of letters, [S.S. Rathore v. State of M.P.,
(1989) 4 SCC 582] or mere settlement discussions, where a final bill is
rejected by making deductions or otherwise. Sections 5 to 20 of the
Limitation Act do not exclude the time taken on account of settlement
discussions. Section 9 of the Limitation Act makes it clear that: “where
once the time has begun to run, no subsequent disability or inability to
institute a suit or make an application stops it.” There must be a clear
notice invoking arbitration setting out the “particular dispute” [Section
21 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996.] (including
claims/amounts) which must be received by the other party within a
period of 3 years from the rejection of a final bill, failing which, the time
bar would prevail.”

13.      To be abundantly clear as to the concept of ‘limitation’ barring a legal
remedy, the following observations of the Hon’ble Supreme Court in
N. Balakrishnan v. M. Krishnamurthy4 may be noticed:
“11. Rules of limitation are not meant to destroy the rights of
parties. They are meant to see that parties do not resort to dilatory
tactics, but seek their remedy promptly. The object of providing a
legal remedy is to repair the damage caused by reason of legal
injury. The law of limitation fixes a lifespan for such legal remedy
for the redress of the legal injury so suffered. Time is precious and
wasted time would never revisit. During the efflux of time, newer
causes would sprout up necessitating newer persons to seek legal
remedy by approaching the courts. So a lifespan must be fixed for
each remedy. Unending period for launching the remedy may lead
to unending uncertainty and consequential anarchy. The law of
limitation is thus founded on public policy. It is enshrined in the
maxim interest reipublicae up sit finislitium (it is for the general
welfare that a period be put to litigation). Rules of limitation are not
meant to destroy the rights of the parties. They are meant to see that
parties do not resort to dilatory tactics but seek their remedy
promptly. The idea is that every legal remedy must be kept alive for
a legislatively fixed period of time.”
14.      What is evident from a conspectus of the foregoing, is that the
petitioner’s claim against the respondents as raised in invocation
notice dated 28.07.2021 is only one: viz. for payment of arrears of
licence fee/other dues amounting to Rs.29,28,100/-, which is founded
upon the termination of the contract by the petitioner vide notice dated
04.01.2017. To be sure, the petitioner’s invocation notice does not
contain any reference to any claim for recovery of hardware,
supposedly lying with the respondents upto the year 2019.
Signing Date:28.09.2022 Arb. P. 91/2022                                                                  Page 6 of 9
15.     Regardless of any correspondence exchanged between the parties
thereafter, it is clear that the petitioner’s cause of action first arose
when the respondents failed to pay the monies due under the contract
in addition to damages, as claimed by the petitioner vide its notice
dated 04.01.2017. In fact, counsel for the petitioner has himself
placed reliance upon Article 137 of the Limitation Act 1963 which
Description of application      Period     of Time from which period
limitation    begins to run
“137. Any other application Three years       When the right to apply
for which no period of                        accrues.
16.     As observed above, the claim in money is the only claim that was
raised in invocation notice dated 28.07.2021; and the argument that
the petitioner was also entitled to get back the hardware and other
equipments lying with the respondents, is to be considered only to be
rejected, since reply dated 31.08.2021 issued by the respondents
records that such hardware was picked-up by the petitioner, which the
petitioner does not dispute. Even more importantly, the law is clear
that an invocation notice must set-out clearly the claims that a party
wants referred to arbitration; and in the present case, no claim for
recovery of hardware was at all contained in invocation notice dated
Signing Date:28.09.2022 Arb. P. 91/2022                                                         Page 7 of 9
17.     In the above view of the matter, the period of limitation applicable to
the petitioner’s claim is as follows: having terminated the contract
with the respondents vide notice dated 04.01.2017, and the
respondents having failed to pay the amounts claimed to be due, the
petitioner ought to have issued the notice invoking arbitration within
03 years of that date, viz. by or before 03.01.2020. However, the
petitioner issued the notice invoking arbitration only on 28.07.2021,
which was evidently beyond the limitation prescribed in law.
18.     To be clear, the limitation in this case is not saved even by order dated
10.01.2022 made by the Hon’ble Supreme Court in Suo Motu Writ
Petition (Civil) No. 03/2020 whereby the Hon’ble Supreme Court was
pleased to direct that running of limitation would be held in abeyance
for the period from 15.03.2020 to 28.02.2022 since the limitation in
respect of the petitioner’s claim ran-out on 03.01.2020 i.e. before the
date of which the Hon'ble Supreme Court’s order takes effect.
19.     For completeness, the two other objections raised on behalf of the
petitioner may also be answered. The petitioner’s objection that the
schedule of payments, as set-out in Annexure 3 to Agreement dated
31.03.2015, ran up-to May 2018 is of no relevance of consequence,
for the reason that admittedly the petitioner terminated the contract
with the respondent by Notice dated 04.01.2017; and could not
therefore have demanded payment up-to May 2018 in the same
breath. The petitioner’s other objection, that since in its reply dated
31.08.2021 the respondent themselves were willing to accept and had
given their consent for appointment of an arbitrator “near to the
locality” where the respondents were located, is neither here nor
Signing Date:28.09.2022 Arb. P. 91/2022                                                      Page 8 of 9
there, since if the court finds that the payments made are ex-facie
time-barred, limitation for invoking a legal remedy cannot be
extended even by consent. Conceptually, limitation bars a legal
remedy and not a legal right, the legal policy being to ensure that
legal remedies are not available endlessly but only up-to a certain
point in time. Needless to add however, that if the respondents are
conceding the petitioner’s claim itself, and are ready and willing to
pay-up, such payment would not be illegal and there could not be any
legal impediment in doing so. A party may concede a claim at any
time; but cannot concede availability of a legal remedy beyond the
prescribed period of limitation.
20.     As a sequitur to the above discussion, this court is of the opinion that
the petitioner’s claim against the respondent is ex-facie time barred
and is accordingly ‘deadwood’; and does not require to be referred to
arbitration.
21.     The present petition is accordingly dismissed.
22.     Other pending applications, if any, also stand disposed of.
