1.      The present petition has been filed under Section 482 of the Code of
Criminal Procedure, 1973 seeking quashing of the order dated 18.09.2018
passed by the Metropolitan Magistrate-06, New Delhi, Patiala House Courts,

04.12.2017 filed in FIR no. 509/2015 under Sections 447/506/420/120B IPC
registered at P.S. South Campus.
2.      The petitioner has challenged the impugned order dated 18.09.2018
on the grounds as mentioned in para 3 of the petition.
3.      Issue notice. Mr. Raghuvinder Varma, Additional Public Prosecutor

4.      The counsel for the petitioner argued that the impugned order had
been passed in the cryptic manner and without application of judicial mind.
It is also not mentioned in the impugned order regarding which offences, the
cognizance was taken by the Trial Court and the impugned order is liable to
be set aside.
5.     FIR no. 509/2015 dated 06.09.2015 under Sections 420/467/471/120B
IPC was got registered at P.S. South Campus, Delhi on the basis of
complaint made by Vanita Vohra. After completion of investigation, the
charge sheet was filed for the offences punishable under Sections
47/506/420/120B IPC. The Trial Court at the time of taking the cognizance
on the basis of charge sheet passed the following order:-
“      Counsel for the complainant undertakes to file
vakalatnama during the course of the day.
Heard. Record perused.
6.     Section 190 empowers a Magistrate to take cognizance of an offence
in certain circumstances. Sub-section (1) reads as under:-
Cognizance of offences by Magistrates.-1) Subject to the provisions of
this Chapter, any Magistrate of the first class, and any Magistrate of the
second class specially empowered in this behalf under Sub-section (2),
may take cognizance of any offence-
(a) upon receiving a complaint of facts which constitute such
(b) upon a police report of such facts;
(c) upon information received from any person other than a police
officer, or upon his own knowledge, that such offence has been
committed.
7.     Cognizance implies application of judicial mind by the Magistrate to
the facts as stated in a complaint or a police report or upon information
received from any person that an offence has been committed. It is the stage
when a Magistrate applies his mind to the suspected commission of an
offence. The cognizance of an offence is stated to be taken once the
Magistrate applies his mind to the offence alleged and decides to initiate
proceeding against the proposed accused. The Court before taking
cognizance needs to be satisfied about existence of prima facie case on basis
of material collected after conclusion of investigation. The magistrate has to
apply his mind to the facts stated in the police report or complaint before
taking cognizance for coming to the conclusion that there is sufficient
material to proceed with the case. Taking of cognizance is a judicial function
and judicial orders cannot be passed in a mechanical or cryptic manner. It is
not only against the settled judicial norms but also reflects lack of
application of judicial mind to the facts of the case. It is equally important to
note that at time of taking cognizance a Magistrate is not required to
consider the defence of the proposed accused or to evaluate the merits of the
material collected during investigation. It is not necessary to pass a detail
order giving detailed reasons while taking cognizance. The order taking
cognizance should only reflect application of judicial mind.
8.     In R.R. Chari V State of Uttar Pradesh, 951CriLJ 775 the question
before the Supreme Court was as to when cognizance of the offence could
be said to have been taken by the Magistrate under Section 190 of the Code.
It was observed as under:-
It is clear from the wording of the section that the initiation of the
proceedings against a person commences on the cognizance of the
offence by the Magistrate under one of the three contingencies
mentioned in the section. The first contingency evidently is in
respect of non-cognizable offences as defined in the Criminal
Procedure Code on the complaint of an aggrieved person. The
second is on a police report, which evidently is the case of a
cognizable offence when the police have completed their
investigation and come to the Magistrate for the issue of a process.
The third is when the Magistrate himself takes notice of an offence
and issues the process. It is important to remember that in respect
of any cognizable offence, the police, at the initial stage when they
are investigating the matter, can arrest a person without obtaining
an order from the Magistrate. Under Section 167(b) of the
Criminal Procedure Code the police have of course to put up the
person so arrested before a Magistrate within 24 hours and obtain
an order of remand to police custody for the purpose of further
investigation, if they so desire. But they have the power to arrest a
person for the purpose of investigation without approaching the
Magistrate first. Therefore in cases of cognizable offence before
proceedings are initiated and while the matter is under
investigation by the police the suspected person is liable to be
arrested by the police without an order by the Magistrate.
9.    The Supreme Court in Fakhruddin Ahmad V State of Uttaranchal,
(2008) 17 SCC 157 also held as under:-
Nevertheless, it is well settled that before a Magistrate can be said
to have taken cognizance of an offence, it is imperative that he
must have taken notice of the accusations and applied his mind to
the allegations made in the complaint or in the police report or the
information received from a source other than a police report, as
the case may be, and the material filed therewith. It needs little
emphasis that it is only when the Magistrate applies his mind and
is satisfied that the allegations, if proved, would constitute an
offence and decides to initiate proceedings against the alleged
offender, that it can be positively stated that he has taken
cognizance of the offence. Cognizance is in regard to the offence
and not the offender.
10.   The Supreme Court also observed in S.K. Sinha, Chief Enforcement
Officer V Videocon International Ltd., (2008) 2 SCC 492 held as under:-
The expression 'cognizance' has not been defined in the Code. But
the word (cognizance) is of indefinite import. It has no esoteric or
mystic significance in criminal law. It merely means 'become
aware of' and when used with reference to a Court or a Judge, it
connotes to take notice of ‘judicially’. It indicates the point when a
Court or a Magistrate takes judicial notice of an offence with a
view to initiating proceedings in respect of such offence said to
have been committed by someone.
'Taking cognizance' does not involve any formal action of any
kind. It occurs as soon as a Magistrate applies his mind to the
suspected commission of an offence. Cognizance is taken prior to
commencement of criminal proceedings. Taking of cognizance is
thus a sine qua non or condition precedent for holding a valid
trial. Cognizance is taken of an offence and not of an offender.
Whether or not a Magistrate has taken cognizance of an offence
depends on the facts and circumstances of each case and no rule of
universal application can be laid down as to when a Magistrate
can be said to have taken cognizance.
11.     The impugned order dated 18.09.2018 is cryptic, non-speaking and is
passed without application of judicial mind. The impugned order has passed
in casual and cursory manner and even the offences regarding which the
cognizance was taken are not mentioned. Accordingly the impugned order
dated 18.09.2018 is set aside. The Trial Court is directed to re-consider the
issue of taking the cognizance afresh and to pass the speaking order on the
basis of charge sheet.
12.     Copy of this order to be sent to the concerned Trial Court for
information and compliance.
13.     The petition along with pending applications, if any, stands disposed
