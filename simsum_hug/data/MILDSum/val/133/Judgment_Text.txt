Heard learned counsel for the petitioner and the
2.    The present petition is filed under Section
482 of Cr.P.C. with the following prayer :-
“Wherefore, it is most humbly prayed
before this Hon'ble court to allow the
petition and further quash proceedings in
C. C. No. 1173/2021 (arising out of Crime
No.160/2020), pending on the file of Civil
Judge & JMFC, At Manvi registered on the
charge sheet filed by the respondent Manvi
Police, for the alleged offences punishable
under sections 505 (1) (a) (b) & 2 of IPC,
in the ends of justice.”
3.    Brief facts which are necessary for disposal
of the petition are as under :
A complaint came to be lodged by Police Sub-
Inspector Law and Order of Manvi police against the
accused    in  crime   No.160/2020   for   the  offences
punishable under Section 505(1)(a), 505(1)(b) and
505(2) of IPC. Gist of the report lodged by Police Sub-
Inspector reveals that on 05.10.2020, on the facebook
page of K.M.Basha, he had posted a message wherein
purportedly a soldier of Pakistan was conversing with
a lady with the words “Har dil ki awaaz Pakistan
zindabad”. He further shared the said message with
his   friends   on   facebook.   On   receipt  of   such
information, the Police Sub-Inspector went to the
Tahsildar Office at about 12.30 pm., and enquired
with the person standing there. He revealed his name
as K.M.Basha, resident of KHB colony, Manvi. On
enquiry,  he   admitted   that he  shared   the  said
message. He also shown the said message in his
mobile and on 06.10.2020 morning, he deleted the
same. Based on the same, Police Sub-Inspector
complained to the Station House Officer with the
report stating that sharing such message would
amount to insulting the soldiers of our country
resulting in demoralizing them and also disturbing
peace and tranquility of the society and therefore,
Police Sub-Inspector sought for action. The matter
was thereafter investigated and cognizance was taken
by the learned Magistrate and case is now pending in
4.     Being     aggrieved      by     the    same,     the
petitioner    has     sought    for    quashing      of   further
proceedings on the following grounds:
x  “The    registration   of   crime    against   the
petitioners/accused       by    the    respondent
police is illegal, arbitrary and amounts to
abuse     of   process    of   law    and   court.
Therefore the same calls for interference of
this Hon'ble court to pass orders quashing
the said proceedings initiated against the
petitioner.
x  That even if the allegations made in the
complaint & charge sheet is taken as true
the same will not constitute the offences
alleged. Therefore to prevent abuse of
process of court or otherwise to secure ends
of justice proceedings are to be quashed
initiated against the petitioners.
x  That, no sanction is obtained from the State
Government or the Central Government in
order to prosecute the petitioner. The other
contention that Section 196 (1) of the Code
prescribes     that   no   Court     shall    take
cognizance of any offence under Section
505 of IPC without the previous sanction of
the    Central    Government     or   the    State
Government       is  given  and     without    the
sanction, the charge sheet has been filed
against the petitioner and hence the very
initiation of the proceedings against the
petitioner is with mala-fides and made with
sole intention to harass the petitioner and
also on perusal of the complaint and FIR it
shows     that ingredients of      the  offences
alleged under Sections 505 (1) (a) (b) & (2)
of IPC are neither made out nor stated and
the very complaint 1s false, fabricated and
lodged with a sole intention to harass the
petitioner    and    hence    the    proceedings
initiated against the petitioner is liable to be
quashed.
x Section 196 (1) clearly mandates that any
offence     punishable   under     Section     505
previous      sanction     of     the     Central
Government or of the State Government or
of   the    District  Magistrate    has    to   be
obtained, after obtaining such sanction only
the Magistrate can take cognizance of the
offence and issue process. In the instant
case no such sanction or permission is
obtained by the investigating agency before
initiation of criminal proceedings against the
petitioner which is bad in law. Accordingly
the impugned order calls for interference by
this Court.
x There is no compliance of the provision of
Section 196(1) (a) of Cr.P.C., also that for
the offence punishable under Section 505 of
IPC prior sanction 1s necessary and so also
investigation is improper as there is no
compliance of Section 196 (3) of Cr.P.C. On
careful perusal of the section 196 (1) of
Cr.P.C., it is crystal clear that before a
cognizance      is    taken    by   the   learned
Magistrate for the offence punishable under
Section    505     IPC,   prior  sanction   under
section 196(1) (a) of Cr.P.C is necessary.
Further, before Such a sanction could be
granted    preliminary     investigation   to  be
conducted      in    respect    of  the   offence
punishable under Section 505 of IPC, the
Competent Authority must authorize the
person as is contemplated under Section
196(3) of Cr.P. C. In the case on hand, as
could be seen from the material on record,
especially charge- sheet materials, there 1s
no sanction order nor there 1s any mention
made in the charge-sheet so as to find-out
that    the    competent    person    as   is
contemplated     under   Section  196(3)   of
Cr.P.C was permitted to carry out the
investigation     after    conducting    the
preliminary investigation. Accordingly, the
charge sheet is vitiated and further action
thereof is also non-est.
x That even if it is assumed that the alleged
allegations constitute an offence, but there
is no legal evidence adduced or collected by
the    prosecution therefore; manifestly the
prosecution fails to prove the same. Under
these circumstances to secure ends Justice
and to prevent abuse of process of law, the
proceedings are liable to be quashed.
x  Viewed     from  any    angle,  proceedings
initiated is not only unfair and unjust, but
also is not proper use of the process of law
and hence the proceedings is liable to be
quashed.
5.     Reiterating   the  grounds   urged    in  the
petition,   learned     counsel  for the   petitioner   Sri
Arunkumar Amargundappa, vehemently              contended
that   action    initiated  by  the  police  and    taking
cognizance by the learned Magistrate is opposed to
law and sought for quashing of the same.
6.     In this regard he places reliance on the
order passed by this Court in Crl.P.No.201547/2021
7.     Per contra, learned High Court Government
Pleader opposed the grounds urged in the petition and
contended that order taking cognizance by the learned
Magistrate is just and proper and sought for dismissal
of the petition.
8.     In view of the rival contentions of the
parties, this Court perused the material on record
9.    Admittedly    for    the offences   punishable
under Section 505 of IPC, prior sanction is necessary.
Further the report of the Police Sub-Inspector has not
been properly      registered while being investigated.
Necessary compliance as to the provisions of Section
196(1) of Cr.P.C., is not followed.
10.   In order to appreciate the rival contentions
of the parties, it is necessary for this Court to cull out
Section 196 of Cr.P.C., which reads as under:
“196. Prosecution for offences against
the State and for criminal conspiracy to
commit such offence. -
(1) No Court shall take cognizance of-
(a)   any offence punishable under Chapter
VI or under section 153A, 2[section
295A or sub section (1) of section
505] of the Indian Penal Code (45 of
(b)    a criminal conspiracy to commit such
(c)    any such abetment, as is described in
section 108A of the Indian Penal Code
(45 of 1860), except with the
previous sanction of the Central
Government        or   of   the    State
[(1A) No Court shall take cognizance of-
(a)     any offence punishable under section
153B or sub-section (2) or sub-
section (3) of section 505 of the
Indian Penal Code (45 of 1860 ), or
(b)     a criminal conspiracy to commit such
except with the previous sanction of the
Central     Government        or   of  the    State
Government or of the District Magistrate.]
(2) No Court shall take cognizance of the
offence of any criminal conspiracy punishable
under section 120B of the Indian Penal code
(45 of 1860), other than a criminal conspiracy
to   commit       [an  offence]   punishable   with
death,    imprisonment      for  life or   rigorous
imprisonment for a term of two years or
upwards, unless the State Government or the
District Magistrate has consented in writing to
the initiation of the proceedings:
Provided that where the criminal conspiracy
is one to which the provisions of section 195
apply, no such consent shall be necessary.
(3) The Central Government or the State
Government may, before according sanction 3
[under sub- section (1) or sub-section (1A)
and   the    District  Magistrate   may,  before
according sanction under sub- section (1A)]
and the State Government or the District
Magistrate may, before giving consent under
sub-    section    (2),  order    a  preliminary
investigation by a police officer not being
below the rank of Inspector, in which case such
police officer shall have the powers referred to
in sub- section (3) of section 155.
11.   On perusal of the above provisions, it is
crystal clear that before taking cognizance by the
learned Magistrate for the offences punishable under
Section 505 of IPC, prior sanction under Section
196(1)(A) of Cr.P.C., is necessary.
12.   It is also clear from the above provisions
that  before    such   a  sanction  could   be  granted,
preliminary investigation is to be conducted in respect
of the offence punishable under Section 505 of IPC by
the   competent      authority  by   a   person   as   is
contemplated under Section 196(3) of Cr.P.C.
13.   On perusal of the material on record in the
case on hand, no such compliance has been made.
Therefore, the following order is passed:
Criminal petition is allowed.
The charge sheet filed by the Manvi Police in
respect   of   Crime   No.160/2020    for  the  offences
punishable under Sections 505(1)(a), 505(1)(b) and
505(2) of IPC and cognizance taken by the learned
Magistrate in pursuance of the charge sheet filed in
the said Crime No.160/2020 is hereby quashed.
Pending proceedings in C.C.No.1173/2021 is hereby
However,       quashing    of   the   order    dated
12.07.2021      would    not   prevent   the   investigating
agency to comply the provisions of Section 196 of
Cr.P.C.,    and     investigate  the    matter   afresh    in
accordance with law, and if sufficient materials are
found in such investigation, the investigating agency
is at liberty to file necessary charge sheet and proceed
with the case in accordance with law.
