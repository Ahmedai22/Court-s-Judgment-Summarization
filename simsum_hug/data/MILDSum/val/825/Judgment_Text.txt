Ms. Jasmin Purani i/b Mr. Rahul Agrawal for the petitioner
Mrs. P.P. Shinde, APP for the respondent no.2 – State
Station present Court.
1.       Heard learned Counsel for the parties.
2.       Rule. Rule is made returnable forthwith. With the consent of
the parties the petition is taken up for final disposal. Learned APP
waives notice on behalf of respondent No. 2 – State.
3.    By this petition, preferred under Section 482 of the Code of
Criminal Procedure, 1973, the petitioner seeks quashing of the FIR
bearing C.R. No. 318 of 2019 dated 17.11.2019 registered with the
BKC Police Station, Mumbai for the alleged offences punishable
under Sections 376, 377, 498A, 354, 506(2), 420, 406, r/w 34 of
4.    A few facts germane for disposal of this petition can be
summarized as follows :-
5.    The petitioner is an Assistant General Manager, serving in
Bank of India, Durgapur, West Bengal. Presently, he is posted as a
Deputy General Manager. He has been arraigned as an accused in
C.R. No. 318 of 2019, dated 17.11.2019 registered by the BKC
Police Station, Mumbai for the alleged offences as above.
6.    Respondent no.1 is the victim whose marriage was solemnized
with Ankit Kaushal Kumar on 04.07.2018 at Hotel Lalit, Panjim,
Goa as per the Hindu rites and rituals. After her marriage, she was
subjected to physical and mental cruelty as well as demand of
jewellery, cash etc. by her husband and in-laws. It is needless to go
into the minute details, which are evident from the charge-sheet
submitted by the Investigating Agency in the Court of 71 st
Metropolitan Magistrate, Bandra, Mumbai. The only role attributed
to the petitioner is that he just acted as a middle-man in introducing
the two families of the bride and bridegroom.
7.     As a matter of fact, it appears that the petitioner, in good
faith, acted as a mediator for fixing the marriage of the respondent
no.1 with the accused no.1 namely Ankit Kaushal Kumar by
providing the contact details of both parties to each other. He is in
no way related with any of the parties.          Surprisingly, there are
absolutely no allegations against him in the first information report
as well as in the statement of the victim recorded by the
Metropolitan Magistrate, 54th Court, Mazgaon, Mumbai under
Section 164(5) Cr.P.C. on 31.01.2020.         It appears that suddenly,
the Investigating Agency had served a Notice under Section 41-A of
the Cr.P.C. through an e-mail upon the applicant, only when he
came to know about an FIR in the instant crime having been
registered against him along with other accused.
8.     Admittedly, the applicant is already on Anticipatory Bail
granted by the Sessions Court, Mumbai on 13.01.2021 in A.B.A.
No.1467 of 2020.
9.     Despite repeatedly asking the learned APP as well as the
Investigating Officer who is present in Court, none could justify as
to how the applicant can be arraigned as an accused in this crime,
even remotely.     This is nothing but an abuse of process of law by
the Investigating Officer which cannot be countenanced. It appears
that only in her supplementary statement recorded on 25.11.2019,
the respondent no.1 had, for the first time, stated that the applicant
has cheated them by exploiting her father sentimentally praising her
husband and in-laws that they are decent, cultured and refined and
that, the boy has also a very good job in a foreign country.            This,
in our view, cannot be said to be the offences, even remotely,
attracting ingredients of Sections 406 or 420 of the Indian Penal
10.    It is obvious that the allegations against the applicant herein
are baseless and without any substance. The allegations made in the
FIR and the final report under Section 173 of the Cr.P.C., even if,
are taken at their face value and accepted in their entirety, do not
prima facie constitute any offence or make out a case against the
applicant.        The material placed before us do not disclose
commission of cognizable or non-cognizable offence having been
committed by the applicant. The allegations are absurd and
inherently improbable on the basis of which no prudent person can
ever reach a just conclusion that there is sufficient ground for
proceeding against the applicant.
11.    In view of the well known judgment in the case of State of
Haryana & Ors. Vs. Bhajan Lal & Ors. 1 this is a fit case to invoke
our jurisdiction under Section 482 of the Cr.P.C. and under Article
226 of the Constitution of India. The FIR and the charge-sheet
against the applicant, therefore, needs to be quashed and set aside
only qua the applicant. Consequently, following order is passed.
12.    Accordingly, the petition is allowed.   The FIR bearing C.R.
No. 318 of 2019 registered with the BKC Police Station, Mumbai
and consequently the charge-sheet filed in the Metropolitan
Magistrate, 71st Court, Bandra Mumbai for the alleged offences
against the petitioner are quashed and set aside.
13.   Rule is made absolute in the aforesaid terms. Application is
disposed of accordingly.
14.   All concerned to act on the authenticated copy of this order.
