1.     M/s. “S.SQUARE INFRA” Company with Registration
No.Sl.No.4879/2017, filed this Transfer Civil Miscellaneous
Petition for transfer of Arbitration O.P.No.2 of 2022 from the file
of VII Additional District Judge, Sangareddy to Principal District
Judge, City Civil Court at Hyderabad.
2.     The Managing Partner of S.SQUARE INFRA filed an
affidavit stating that Respondents 1 & 2 filed a petition under
Section 9 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996,      vide
Arbitration O.P.No.2 of 2022 before the Principal District Judge
at Sangareddy and then it was made over to VII Additional
District Judge, Sangareddy. As the said post fell vacant, it is
allotted to V Additional District Judge-cum-SC/ST Court.
Respondent Nos.1 & 2 filed a petition under Section 9 of the
Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, requesting the Court to
grant injunction restraining the respondents 3 to 7 from
transferring or alienating or creating any third party interest in
the schedule properties to an extent of 16.66% share each
belonging to the respondents 1 & 2 who are the partners of
petitioner firm.
3.     Learned counsel for the petitioner stated that he recieved
a legal notice on 05.03.2021 issued by the Respondents
Court, Hyderabad, who is residing at Masab Tank, Hyderabad,
as an Arbitrator on their behalf so that both of them can
appoint the said Arbitrator for resolving the disputes between
both the parties. As they nominated the Arbitrator residing at
Hyderabad, they have agreed the seat of arbitration at
Hyderabad. As such, they cannot change the jurisdiction once
again and he also relied upon the citation reported in INDUS
INNNOVATIONS PRIVATE LIMITED & ORS.1 wherein, at para
20, it was held as follows:-
“20. A conspectus of all the aforesaid provisions shows
that the moment the seat is designated, it is akin to an
exclusive jurisdiction clause. On the facts of the present
case, it is clear that the seat of arbitration is Mumbai
and Clause 19 further makes it clear that jurisdiction
exclusively vests in the Mumbai Courts. Under the Law
of Arbitration, unlike the Code of Civil Procedure which
applies to suits filed in Courts, a reference to “seat” is a
concept by which a neutral venue can be chosen by the
parties to an arbitration clause. The neutral venue may
not in the classical sense have jurisdiction that is, no
part of the cause of action may have arisen at the
neutral venue and neither would any of the provisions
of Section 16 to 21 of the CPC be attracted.               In
arbitration law however, as has been held above, the
moment “seat” is determined, the fact that the seat is at
Mumbai would vest Mumbai Courts with exclusive
jurisdiction for purposes of regulating arbitral
proceedings arising out of the agreement between the
parties.”
and requested this Court to transfer Arbitration O.P.No.2 of
2022 from the file of VII Additional District Judge, Sangareddy
to Principal District Judge, City Civil Court at Hyderabad.
4.     Learned counsel for the petitioner relied upon the notice
issued by the respondents on 05.03.2021 in which they
Court, Hyderabad as Arbitrator on their behalf and requested
the respondents 3 to 6 to appoint their Arbitrator so that both of
them can appoint a Presiding Arbitrator for resolving the
disputes between both the parties.
5.     Learned counsel for the respondents filed reply to the
notice given to them on 13.03.2021 in which they specifically
stated that there is no dispute for appointing the Arbitrator and
appointing of Arbitrator is not necessary and they rejected their
claim for appointing the Arbitrator on their behalf. As such, the
constitution of Arbitration Tribunal is not warranted.
6.     The learned counsel for the respondents stated that they
filed O.S.No.67 of 2021 before the VII Additional District Judge,
Sanga Reddy, for relief of permanent injunction. Though the
petitioner and respondents had appeared before the Court, they
did not take any objection regarding the territorial jurisdiction,
but they filed petition under Section 8 of Arbitration Act seeking
a direction to refer the matter to the Arbitrator in I.A.No.864 of
2021 and it was allowed and the matter was referred to
arbitration. As the respondents first approached the Court of
VII Additional District Judge, Sanga Reddy, he also filed
Arbitration O.P.No.2 of 2022 before the same Court. As such,
the Courts at Hyderabad have no jurisdiction at all.          Though
both the parties entered into partnership deed on 27.10.2018
and in Clause-23 of the partnership deed, it was specifically
mentioned as follows:-
“23.     In case of any dispute or disputes arising both the
partners the same shall be referred to an Arbirator or
Arbitrators chosen by the partners and the award given
by the Arbitrator or Arbitrators shall be final and binding
on all the partners.”
In the said partnership deed, there was no mention about the
place of arbitration or the seat of arbitration.
7.    The learned counsel for the petitioner mainly contended
that as the respondents nominated the Arbitrator residing at
Hyderabad,      only  the   Courts   at   Hyderabad     are    having
jurisdiction but not the Courts at Sangareddy and thus, sought
for transfer.     Admittedly, the offer of the respondents was
rejected by the petitioner herein and he specifically stated that
the constitution of Arbitration Tribunal is not warranted, as
such, the respondents filed a suit. But again, the petitioner filed
a petition under Section 8 of Arbitration Act and the Court
referred the matter to Arbitration. As such, the respondent filed
O.P.2 of 2022 before the same Court. Therefore, the argument
of the learned counsel for the petitioner that merely because an
Arbitrator of Hyderabad was nominated by the respondents,
only the Courts at Hyderabad are having jurisdiction, is not
8.     Learned counsel for the petitioner cited several citations
requesting the Court to decide the seat or venue of Arbitration.
Admittedly, it was not specifically mentioned by them in their
partnership deed and they filed this transfer CMP only for
transfer of Arbitration O.P.2 of 2022 from the file of VII
Additional District Judge at Sanga Reddy to the Court of
Principal District Judge, City Civil Court at Hyderabad. Since
the scope of transfer CMP is limited, this Court need not decide
the seat or venue of Arbitration.
9.     The learned counsel for the respondent referred Section
42 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act which reads as
42.    Jurisdiction.—      Notwithstanding     anything
contained elsewhere in this Part or in any other law for
the time being in force, where with respect to an
arbitration agreement any application under this Part
has been made in a Court, that Court alone shall have
jurisdiction over the arbitral proceedings and all
subsequent applications arising out of that agreement
and the arbitral proceedings shall be made in that
Court and in no other Court.
He stated that as he filed suit before the VII Additional District
Judge, Sangareddy as per the directions of the Court, he filed
Arbitration O.P.No.2 of 2022 also before the same Court in view
of Section 42 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996.
Therefore, I do not find any merits in the transfer CMP and
hence it is liable to be dismissed.
10.   Accordingly, the transfer Civil Miscellaneous Petition is
dismissed. There shall be no order as to costs.
11.   Miscellaneous petitions, if any pending, shall stand
