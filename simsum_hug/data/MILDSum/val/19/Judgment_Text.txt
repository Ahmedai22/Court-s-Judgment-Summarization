prosecution under the Gangster Act has been launched against
the applicant on the basis of one criminal case shown in the

not the member of any gang. It is further stated that there is no
other criminal history of the applicant. The applicant is
languishing in jail since 20.12.2020. In case, the applicant is
released on bail, he will not misuse the liberty of bail.

not disputed the aforesaid submissions of learned counsel for
the applicant.

application is allowed. Let the applicant Kuldeep Sharma @
