The Allahabad High Court on Tuesday granted bail to a self-styled international Hindu Leader and Yogi Sena Pramukh, Kuldeep Sharma @ Kuldeep Hindu in a Gangster Act Case.
The prosecution under the Gangster Act had been launched against Sharma on the basis of a criminal case registered against him for allegedly misusing the popularity of the present Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh, Yogi Adityanath, and fooling various persons to deposit money in bank accounts run by him.
It has been alleged that Sharma formed two websites wherein he had shown himself to be an international Hindu Leader (Yogi Sena Pramukh). Allegedly, he used to take money from the public at large and used the said amount for his own use.
In that very case, he has already been granted bail last month by the Bench of Justice Krishan Pahal. However, in the instant case registered against him under the Gangster Act due to the abovementioned cheating case, he was in jail.

Now, seeking bail in the U.P. Gangster and Anti-Social Activities (Prevention) Act, 1986, he had moved the instant bail plea. His Counsel argued that the prosecution under the Gangster Act had been launched against the applicant on the basis of one criminal case shown in the gang chart and he is on bail in the aforesaid case.
It was further argued that he had been falsely implicated in the present case due to police rivalry and that he is not a member of any gang. It was further stated that there was no other criminal history of the applicant and that he was languishing in jail since December 20, 2020.Â 
In view of these submissions, without expressing any opinion on the merits, the bail application was allowed by the bench of Justice Ramesh Sinha. 
"Let the applicant Kuldeep Sharma @ Kuldeep Hindu, involved in aforesaid case crime be released on bail on his furnishing a personal bond and two heavy sureties each in the like amount to the satisfaction of the court concerned...," the Court remarked as it granted bail to him.
