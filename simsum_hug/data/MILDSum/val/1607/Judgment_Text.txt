Prayer in the present Criminal Writ Petition filed under
Article 226 of the Constitution of India read with the Punjab Good
Conduct Prisoner's (Temporary Release) Act, 1962 for issuance of a writ
in the nature of mandamus for directing the respondents to release the
petitioner for a period of eight weeks to meet his family members and
look after them.
2.           Learned counsel for the petitioner has submitted that the
petitioner was convicted in FIR No.9 dated 21.01.2018, under Section 22
of the NDPS Act, registered at Police Station Dhanaula, District Barnala,
vide judgment and order of sentence dated 22.09.2021 and was sentenced
to undergo rigorous imprisonment for a period of 10 years and against the
said judgment, an appeal has been filed before this Court, which has been
admitted and the petitioner has been in custody since the more than last 1
year and 10 months. It is submitted that the petitioner had applied for
parole and his case was forwarded to respondent No.2 and the same was
rejected, vide impugned order dated 04.07.2022. It is argued that the
impugned order dated 04.07.2022 was passed on the basis of surmises
and conjectures, inasmuch as, in the said order, it had been stated that in
case the petitioner is released on parole, then, he might maintain contact
with drugs smugglers and also sell intoxicant substances and could also
commit any crime. It is stated that there is no tangible material relied
upon to come to the said conclusion. It is further stated that the petitioner
is not involved in any other case under the NDPS Act, except the present
case, regarding which an appeal is pending. In support of his arguments,
learned counsel for the petitioner has relied upon the judgment of the
Division Bench of this Court in case titled as “Jugraj Singh @ Bhola Vs.
State of Punjab and others”, reported as 2010(25) R.C.R. (Criminal)
138 as well as judgment of the Co-ordinate Bench of this Court in “Jeet
Singh Vs. State of Punjab and others, reported as 2020(3) R.C.R.
3.           Learned State counsel on the other hand has opposed the
present petition and has submitted that since the petitioner has been
convicted under the NDPS Act, thus, the authorities found that there is
every possibility that he may contact drug smugglers and sell intoxicant
substances and has thus, stated that the impugned order has been rightly
4.           This Court has heard learned counsel for the parties and has
gone through the paper-book.
5.            The petitioner has been in custody since the last 1 year and
10 months and 5 days. It is not in dispute that the petitioner has two minor
children and the petitioner has moved the application for grant of parole
for meeting his family members and looking after them, which as per para
7 of the petition, includes his two minor children.
6.            The Hon’ble Division Bench of this Court in Jugraj Singh
@ Bhola case (supra), has held as under: -
"It is also conceded position that the petitioner can be
temporarily released on parole for four weeks under Clause (d) of sub-
section (1) of Section 3 of the Punjab Good Conduct Prisoners
(Temporary Release) Act, 1962 (hereinafter referred to as `the Act') to
enable him to meet his family members. In our opinion, the release of a
convict on parole is a wing of reformative process. Section 3 of the Act
has been enacted as a reformative measure with an object to enable
the prisoner to have family association or to perform certain family
obligations and rituals. Until and unless sufficient material is
available with the authorities giving solid reasons for declining the
temporary release of a convict on parole, this benefit should not be
declined to him. In the instant case, no such strong material or basis
has been relied upon by the respondents while rejecting the prayer of
the petitioner for releasing him on parole for four weeks to meet his
family members.”
A perusal of the above-said judgment would show that it has
been observed that a convict can be temporarily released on parole for
four weeks under Clause (d) of sub-section (1) of Section 3 of the Punjab
Good Conduct Prisoners (Temporary Release) Act, 1962 to enable him to
meet his family members and the release of a convict on parole is a wing
of reformative process.
7.            A Co-ordinate Bench of this Court in Jeet Singh’s case
(supra) has held as under: -
"The petitioner has sought temporary release on two counts
firstly, he claims that his parents are of an advanced age and there is
no one to take care of them at this old age and secondly, he claims that
his house is in need of repairs. The claim on both grounds has been
verified by a Municipal Councilor, vide Annexure P-1. Though
expression “sufficient cause” as mentioned in Section 3(1)(d) of 1962
Act, has not been defined, but the reasons given by the petitioner for
his release on parole will fall within the ambit of “sufficient cause”
and therefore, his request is entitled to be accepted.”
A perusal of the above-said judgment would show that the
plea taken that the parents of the petitioner therein were of an advanced
age and there was no one to take care of them, was considered to be a
reason to fall within the meaning of “sufficient cause” and therefore, the
reason furnished by the said petitioner therein was accepted.
8.              To a similar effect is the judgment passed by a Co-ordinate
Bench of this Court in "Narinder Singh @ Nindi Vs. State of Punjab
and others", reported as 2020(2) DC (Narcotics) 253. In the said
judgment, it has been observed in para 14 that, in view of the beneficial
nature of the statutory provisions made in the Act, which aimed at
reformation and rehabilitation of the prisoner, the petitioner therein would
be entitled to grant of parole for socializing with his family members and
the same would constitute sufficient cause within the meaning of Section
3(1)(d) of the 1962 Act.
9.              A cumulative reading of the above-said judgments would
show that meeting one's family is one of the most important facets of right
to life and thus, said ground for parole is legal and valid and in
accordance with law.
10.           In the present case, in the impugned order, the primary
reason given for rejection is that in case, the petitioner is released, then he
might contact drug smugglers and could sell intoxicant substances and
could also commit crime. There is no material on the basis of which the
said observation have been made. The petitioner is not involved in any
other case under the NDPS Act.
11.           A Division Bench of this Court in case titled as "Gursahib
Singh Vs. State of Punjab and others", passed in CRWP-867-2021,
decided on 31.05.2022 has held as under: -
"The present petition has been filed for release of the petitioner
on parole raising challenge to the order dated 15.05.2020 (Annexure
P-2) wherein, the Senior Superintendent of Police, Tarn Taran gave
an adverse recommendation regarding the release of the petitioner on
account of the fact that he is habitual of consuming intoxicants and
while on parole, he could cause threat to peace and may indulge in
selling intoxicating substances and may be declared as a proclaimed
offender. Keeping in view the adverse recommendation, the rejection
order dated 19.05.2020 has been passed by the Deputy Commissioner,
The reasoning given in the said order is that in view of the
adverse recommendation that the convict is a drug addict and if
released on parole, he could harm peace and there is apprehension
that he would again be involved in drug trafficking and there are
chances of absconding also, the rejection was there.
We are of the considered opinion that the order is de hors the
provisions of the Punjab Good Conduct Prisoners (Temporary
Release) Act, 1962 (in short 'the 1962 Act') and has lost sight of the
purpose for which the said Act has been promulgated. A perusal of the
custody certificate dated 30.05.2022, which has been filed today by
the State and which is taken on record, would go on to show that the
petitioner has undergone actual period of 2 years, 11 months and 16
days by now on account of the conviction which has been recorded of
12 years under Section 18 of the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic
Substances Act, 1985 (in short 'the NDPS Act') on 18.01.2020. It is a
matter of record that he has also been convicted for a period of 4
years and 6 months in FIR No. 106 under Section 21, 61 and 85 of the
NDPS Act and also was involved in FIR No. 22 dated 03.02.2004
under Section 61 of the Punjab Excise Act, 1914. The custody
certificate would also go on to show that he has not been granted the
benefit of parole since the date of his conviction. A period of more
than 2 years has gone by.
The ground that there is an apprehension that he would be again
involved and that he may abscond are mere imaginations of the
authorities as such. It is the duty of the State itself that the convict
should not indulge in such activities and preventive measures should
be taken and on account of such apprehensions, the benefit of the
release cannot be denied. The earlier involvement was of the year
2005 and much water has flown down after that. He is already
suffered imprisonment for 4-1/2years and, therefore, for the same, he
cannot be penalized twice by denying him the benefit of parole.
Accordingly, we are of the considered opinion that the
reasoning given in the impugned order 15.05.2020 (Annexure P-2)
and the subsequent order passed by the Deputy Commissioner
19.05.2020 (Annexure R-2/T) are not justified and do not stand
reason. They are accordingly quashed and a writ of mandamus is
issued to release the petitioner on parole for a period of 4 weeks. He
shall surrender back to the Jail Authorities on the expiry of the said
period.
The petition stands disposed off accordingly."
A perusal of the above-said judgment would show that even
in the said case, an adverse report had been given against the petitioner
therein on the assumption that he would be a threat to peace and may
indulge in selling of intoxicant substances and the said assumption was
made on the basis of the fact that he was habitual of consuming
intoxicants. From the custody certificate, it was further apparent that the
petitioner therein was involved in other cases under the NDPS Act. The
Division Bench after considering the facts of the said case observed that
the apprehension that the petitioner therein would be again involved in a
criminal case and may abscond were mere imaginations of the authorities
and accordingly, the impugned order was set aside and the petitioner
therein was released on parole for a period of four weeks.
12.           A Co-ordinate Bench of this Court in case titled as "Mohd.
Iftkhar @ Kaka Vs. State of Punjab and others", passed in CRWP-
7999-2022, decided on 15.09.2022, has held as under: -
"7. A perusal of the impugned order dated 05.08.2022
(Annexure R-1) would show that it is based completely on supposition.
There is nothing on record to substantiate as to what inputs were
available with the Senior Superintendent of Police, Malerkotla to
come to the conclusion that the petitioner would indulge in the
business of smuggling of intoxicating substances or would cause a law
and order problem if he was released on parole. Thus, the impugned
order which is based on the said report is completely non-speaking
and non-specific.
8.      In the present case, even as per the reply of the State,
there is no specific input from any quarter to suggest that the
petitioner would indulge in the commission of a similar offence for
which he has been convicted or that there would be any law and order
problem in case he is granted the concession of parole."
13.           In the present case also, there is no specific input from any
quarter to suggest that the petitioner would indulge in the crime for which
he had been convicted and thus, the impugned order, having been passed
on the basis of surmises and conjectures, deserves to be set aside.
14.           Keeping in view the above-said facts and circumstances as
well as the law laid down in the above-said judgments, the present
petition is allowed and the impugned order dated 04.07.2022 is hereby set
aside. The petitioner is ordered to be released on parole for a period of
eight weeks from the date of release on his furnishing requisite personal
and surety bonds to the satisfaction of the District Magistrate concerned,
and the said District Magistrate is directed to impose such conditions as
may be considered necessary to secure the presence of the petitioner in
jail after the parole period is over and to ensure that the temporary release
is not misused by securing the bond of mandatory good conduct with a
clear stipulation that in case the petitioner commits any offence during his
period of temporary release, his release warrants would be cancelled as
provided in Rule 4 of Punjab Good Conduct Prisoners' (Temporary
