Counsel for Petitioner :- Amit Kumar Verma,Gambhir Singh
Counsel for Respondent :- G.A,Gajendra Singh
Heard Shri Gambhir Singh, learned counsel for the petitioners
and Shri Gajendra Singh, learned counsel for respondent nos.4
and 5 as well as learned A.G.A. Perused the record.
Shri Gajendra Singh, learned counsel for the respondent nos.4
and 5 has filed a counter affidavit in the Court itself, is taken on
Pursuant to my earlier order dated 14.3.2022 Smt. Deepa
Sharma and Smt. Rama Chauhan are present in the Court along
with Km. Sanaya Sharma (minor daughter of 5 years) and
Master Tanisk Sharma (minor son of 2½ years). Learned
counsel for the parties have identified the corpus as well as their
respective guardians.
This is a claim made by a mother Ms. Seema Sharma, who is a
named accused of Case Crime No.499 of 2020.
Submission made by learned counsel for the petitioner is that
the marriage of Ms. Seema Sharma was solemnized with the
son of Ms. Deepa Sharma, namely, Kapil Sharma (now late) on
12.3.2016 and the couple were blessed with a daughter Sanaya
and a son Tanisk. Unfortunately, Kapil Sharma committed
suicide on 16.11.2020 and in this regard a F.I.R. was got
registered by Akash Sharma against his wife Ms. Seema
Sharma and 5 others. The investigation is still going on and no
charge sheet has been submitted so far. Since after the said and
unfortunate demise of Kapil Sharma, his wife Seema Sharma
started living with her sister at Moradabad independently,
whereas, her small kids namely Sanaya and Tanisk remained in
the company of her grand-mother Ms. Deepa Sharma and since
then they are residing with her grand-mother. Ms. Seema
Sharma, being mother and natural guardian of minor children is
claiming their custody by means of instant habeas corpus
Before reaching to any conclusion it would be apt and
profitable to have a fleeting glance over the Section-6 of the
Hindu Minority and Guardianship Act, 1956 :
"6. Natural guardians of a Hindu minor.—The natural guardian
of a Hindu minor, in respect of the minor's person as well as in
respect of the minor's property (excluding his or her undivided
interest in joint family property), are—
(a) in the case of a boy or an unmarried girl—the father, and
after him, the mother: provided that the custody of a minor
who has not completed the age of five years shall ordinarily
(b) in case of an illegitimate boy or an illegitimate unmarried
girl—the mother, and after her, the father;
(c)in the case of a married girl—the husband: Provided that no
person shall be entitled to act as the natural guardian of a minor
under the provisions of this section—
(b) if he has completely and finally renounced the world by
becoming a hermit (vanaprastha) or an ascetic (yati or sanyasi).
Explanation.—In this section, the expression "father" and
"mother" do not include a step-father and a step-mother"
Section 6(a) of the said Act, therefore, preserves the right of the
father to be the guardian of the property of the minor child but
not the guardian of his person, whilst the child is less than five
years old. It carves out the exception of interim custody, in
distinction of guardianship, and then specifies that custody
should be given to the mother so long as the child is below five
years in age. The Act immediately provides that the custody of
a minor who has not completed the age of 5 years shall
ordinarily be with the mother. In the instant case where there is
unfortunate tussle between the mother, being natural guardian
of the kids on one hand and the grandmother and paternal aunt
(Bua) on the other hand, then this Court is of the considered
opinion that the mother, being natural guardian of those kids is
stand on much higher footing than that of grandmother or their
parental aunt (Bua).
Children are not play things of their parents. Their welfare is of
paramount importance and they will be well protected when the
mother is with them. A child should never feel as if they need to
earn a mother's love. This will leave a void in their heart all of
their life. A mother's love must be given unconditionally to
establish trust and a firm foundation of emotional intimacy in a
child's life. If love is withheld, a child will look for it in a
million other ways. Sometimes they will search throughout
their lifetime, unless they come to some sort of peace with their
past. The emotional foundation we give our children at home is
foundational to their life. We cannot underestimate the value of
the home and the power of a mother's love.
In the case at hand, the age of Sanaya is barely of five years,
whereas Tanisk is aged about two and half years. Both of them
are minor and not of an impressionable age, who requires and
deserves unqualified love, affection and protection of their
mother, who is their natural guardian. After weighing the rights
of a mother and grand-mother towards the children, this Court
finds more weight in the right of mother being a natural
guardian than that of the grand-mother, therefore, custody of
both children Km. Sanaya Sharma and Tanisk Sharma is handed
over to their mother Ms. Seema Sharma in the Court itself, with
a rider that, Ms Deepa Sharma (grand-mother), if she desires,
would have a visitation right over his grand-children once in a
week i.e. on every Saturday between 12.00 noon to 05.00 P.M.
and the mother Ms Seema Sharma is bound to provide a
congenial atmosphere for the proposed meetings and would not
create any hindrance or obstacle in the same.
With this observation the habeas corpus petition is disposed off.
It is made clear that in the event of anything serious untoward
happens to these children, it is always open for the concerned
parties to move a recall application, in the larger interest of the
kids.
