2.     Mr.Monal Chaglani, learned advocate has challenged
the impugned judgment and award on the ground that the
learned Tribunal has not considered the oral as well as
documentary evidence on record and has not considered
the income aspect in accordance with the judgments of
the Hon’ble Apex Court where the income tax returns
were produced before the Court. According to Mr.Chaglani,
the    learned       Tribunal has      erred in   considering            the
aggregate income of the deceased for the last three years
and has not even considered the mother of the deceased
as dependent while both the parents were dependent on
the deceased son. He further submitted that the Tribunal
has totally discarded the evidence and has erred in not
considering the parents as dependent and only granted a
lump-sum amount of Rs.50,000=00, which could have
been granted even under Section 140 of the Motor
Vehicles Act. In support of the submission to consider the
parents as dependent, Mr.Chaglani has relied upon the
following judgments :
(1)      Chandra and others vs. Mukesh Kumar Yadav
and others, (2021) 6 ALT 116;
(2)      Indrawati and others vs. Ranbir Singh and
others, 2021 ACJ 2156;
(3)      Sukhdev Prasad vs. Sunil Kumar and others,
(4)      N.Jayashree and others vs. Cholamandalam MS
General Insurance Co. Ltd. and others, AIR 2021
(5)      Jagruthi Shishir Banugariya and others vs. Rajvi
Kanthan Ahir and others, 2016 ACJ 905;
(6)      National Insurance Company Ltd. and others vs.
Birender and others, AIR 2020 SC 434.
3.     Countering the argument, Mr.Daxesh Mehta, learned
advocate appearing for the Insurance Company submitted
that the learned Tribunal has given reasons for not
considering the parents as dependent and further it has
been submitted by Mr.Mehta, relying upon the judgment
of the Division Bench of this Court in the case of
Bhavnaben            Shaileshbhai      Rank     vs.    Mahmadmkhan
Mahmadjallaudinkhan Pathan (First Appeal No.3508 of
2021, decided on 6th December 2021), that if at all the
income of the deceased has to be considered, then the
aggregate income for the last three years is required to be
assessed since there is no evidence to support the ITRs
filed by the deceased.
4.     The learned Tribunal, while considering the report,
found that the applicant no.1 Sonalben alias Charmiben
Hirenbhai Jivani, i.e. widow of the deceased, had made a
declaration to affidavit Exh.23 to delete her name and she
had consented to give her share of compensation to the
applicants nos.2 and 3 respectively since stating that she
remarried          after  the  death        of her   husband           in     an
unfortunate incident. The applicant no.2 being the mother
of the deceased examined herself at Exh.20 and she
admitted that her daughter-in-law, i.e. applicant no.1, has
remarried. In that circumstances, the learned Tribunal
observed that there were only two applicants, i.e. mother
and father of the deceased, on record and the learned
Tribunal went on to consider the issue, whether or not the
parents        were entitled  to      the compensation,             while
determining the same on the basis of the available
evidence. The learned Tribunal thus observed that the
mother of the deceased, after the marriage of the
deceased with the applicant no.1, moved to Rajkot and
the father of the deceased owned a shop at Bagsara.
Thus, the learned Tribunal observed that prior to the
accident, the sustenance of the parents was on the
income of the shop which, as per the learned Tribunal,
continued. Thus, the learned Tribunal did not find the
applicants nos.2 and 3 as the dependent on the income of
the deceased. Hence, the learned Tribunal did not deem
fit to      grant any   compensation      under     the head of
dependency loss.
5.     The claimant no.2 had filed her examination-in-chief
at Exh.20. She was cross-examined, and during the course
of her cross-examination, she admitted the fact that after
the marriage, her son and daughter-in-law started staying
in Rajkot, while she volunteered that she too was staying
at Rajkot along with her son. The said evidence has been
read by the Tribunal. She further stated that her husband
was having a photocopy shop at Bagsara and she was also
having occupation along with her husband. The shop was
being run prior to the accident and it continued. The
income from the shop was used for their livelihood. She
also affirmed that her husband continued with the shop.
6.     In the case of Chanda and anothers (supra), while
appreciating the facts of the case that the unfortunate
parents had lost their son aged about 32 years and the
claim compensation was filed under Section 166 of the
Motor Vehicles Act and where an issue was raised about
the parents not being the dependent as they were found
to be living separately, the Hon’ble Apex Court, while
deciding the case and referring the judgment of Magma
General Insurance Company Limited and others vs. Nanu
Ram @ Chuhru Ram and others, reported in (2018) 18 SCC
130, observed that the finding of the Tribunal that the
parents cannot be treated as dependent would run
contrary to the judgment of the Apex Court in the case of
Sarla Varma and others vs. Delhi Transport Corporation
and another, reported in (2009) 6 SCC 121.
7.     In the case of Indrawati and others (supra), the Delhi
High Court, while appreciating the fact that the deceased-
son had died at the age of 23 years and was survived by
parents, who had claimed compensation, a question was
raised for the consideration as to whether the mother
would be entitled to compensation for the death of her
son. The Hon’ble Delhi High Court, while observing the
case of Mahendrakumar Ramrao Gaikwad vs. Gulabbai
Ramrao Gaikwad, reported in 2001 Cri.L.J. 2111 from the
Bombay High Court, referred to the ancient scriptures of
‘manu’ to acknowledge the recognition of the rights of
aged parents to be maintained by their children even if
the children are unable to maintain themselves. The case
was also considered to appreciate the parental consortium
and even the case of Sarla Varma (supra) was referred to
observe that the Supreme Court had laid down the three
years’ principle for computation of compensation in
respect of death of parents as well as spouse while
applying the multiplier method by further observing that
the application of those principles have not been made
subject to any condition meaning thereby that no further
evidence is required to prove the dependencies in the
case. Thus, the Delhi High Court, while considering the
settled law laid down by the Supreme Court in the above
referred judgments, held that the parents of deceased
child are considered as dependent for consideration of
8.     In Sukhdev Prasad (supra), the Delhi High Court,
while considering the dependency of the parents on the
death of 25 years’ old son and referring the ratio laid
down in the case of National Insurance Company Limited
vs. Pranay Sethi and others, reported in AIR 2017 SC
(supra), Indrawati and others (supra), held that the
parents of the deceased are always considered as
dependent upon their       children     and are entitled to
compensation according to the principles laid down by the
Hon’ble Apex Court in the case of Pranay Sethi (supra).
9.    In N.Jayashree and others (supra), the mother-in-law
of  a     deceased       son-in-law      was    also    considered             as
10. In       Birender    and   others        (supra),   in    context           of
dependency of the major son, it has been observed that
the legal representatives of the deceased would be
entitled to receive compensation under the conventional
heads. It was observed in paragraphs 12, 13, 14 and 15 as
“12. We have heard Mr. Amit Kumar Singh, learned
counsel for the insurance company (appellant) and
Ms. Abha R. Sharma, learned counsel for the
respondent Nos. 1 and 2. The principal issues which
arise for our consideration are as follows :
(i) Whether the major sons of the deceased who
are married and gainfully employed or earning,
can   claim   compensation          under      the        Motor
Vehicles Act, 1988 (for short, ‘the Act’) ?
(ii) Whether such legal representatives are
entitled   only   for     compensation         under          the
conventional heads ?
(iii) Whether the amount receivable by the legal
representatives of the deceased under the 2006
Rules is required to be deducted as a whole or
only portion thereof?
13. Reverting to the first issue - that needs to be
answered on the basis of the scheme of the Act.
Section        166  of the     Act     provides    for      filing of
application for compensation by persons mentioned
in clauses (a) to (d) of sub-section (1) thereof.
Section 166 of the Act, as applicable at the relevant
time, reads thus:
“Section 166. Application for compensation.- (1)
An application for compensation arising out of
an accident of the nature specified in sub-
section (1) of section 165 may be made-
(a) by the person who has sustained the injury;
(b) by the owner of the property; or
(c) where death has resulted from the accident,
by all or any of the legal representatives of the
(d) by any agent duly authorised by the person
injured or all or any of the legal representatives
of the deceased, as the case may be:
Provided      that       where      all      the           legal
representatives of the deceased have not joined
in any such application for compensation, the
application shall be made on behalf of or for the
benefit of all the legal representatives of the
deceased and the legal representatives who
have not so joined, shall be impleaded as
respondents to the application.
(2)   Every application under sub-section (1)
shall be made, at the option of the claimant,
either to the Claims Tribunal having jurisdiction
over the area in which the accident occurred or
to the Claims Tribunal within the local limits of
whose    jurisdiction      the claimant       resides           or
carries on business or within the local limits of
whose jurisdiction the defendant resides, and
shall   be   in  such       form   and    contain           such
particulars as may be prescribed:
Provided that where no claim for compensation
under Section 140 is made in such application,
the    application     shall    contain      a      separate
statement to that effect immediately before the
signature of the applicant.
(4) The Claims Tribunal shall treat any report of
accidents forwarded to it under subsection (6)
of    section    158       as    an    application             for
compensation under this Act.”
14. The legal representatives of the deceased could
move application for compensation by virtue of
clause (c) of Section 166(1). The major married son
who is also earning and not fully dependant on the
deceased, would be still covered by the expression
“legal representative” of the deceased. This Court in
Manjuri Bera (supra) had expounded that liability to
pay compensation under the Act does not cease
because of absence of dependency of the concerned
legal representative. Notably, the expression “legal
representative” has not been defined in the Act. In
Manjuri Bera (supra), the Court observed thus:
“9.   In terms of clause (c) of sub-section (1) of
Section 166 of the Act in case of death, all or
any of the legal representatives of the deceased
become entitled to compensation and any such
legal representative can file a claim petition.
The proviso to said sub-section makes the
position    clear     that      where     all    the         legal
representatives had not joined, then application
can    be    made       on      behalf    of     the         legal
representatives of the deceased by impleading
those legal representatives as respondents.
Therefore, the High Court was justified in its
view that the appellant could maintain a claim
petition in terms of Section 166 of the Act.
10. …..The Tribunal has a duty to make an
award, determine the amount of compensation
which is just and proper and specify the person
or persons to whom such compensation would
be   paid.    The     latter     part   relates        to      the
entitlement of compensation by a person who
claims for the same.
11. According to Section 2(11) CPC, “legal
representative” means a person who in law
represents the estate of a deceased person, and
includes any person who intermeddles with the
estate of the deceased and where a party sues
or is sued in a representative character the
person on whom the estate devolves on the
death of the party so suing or sued. Almost in
similar   terms    is      the   definition       of       legal
representative     under       the    Arbitration           and
Conciliation Act, 1996 i.e. under Section 2(1)(g).
12. As observed by this Court in Custodian of
Branches of BANCO National Ultramarino v.
Nalini Bai Naique [1989 Supp (2) SCC 275] the
definition contained in Section 2(11) CPC is
inclusive in character and its scope is wide, it is
not confined to legal heirs only. Instead it
stipulates that a person who may or may not be
legal heir competent to inherit the property of
the deceased can represent the estate of the
deceased person. It includes heirs as well as
persons who represent the estate even without
title either as executors or administrators in
possession of the estate of the deceased. All
such    persons    would       be   covered         by       the
expression “legal representative”. As observed
in Gujarat SRTC v. Ramanbhai Prabhatbhai
[(1987) 3 SCC 234] a legal representative is one
who suffers on account of death of a person due
to a motor vehicle accident and need not
necessarily be a wife, husband, parent and
child.”
In paragraph 15 of the said decision, while adverting
to the provisions of Section 140 of the Act, the Court
observed that even if there is no loss of dependency,
the claimant, if he was a legal representative, will be
entitled to compensation. In the concurring judgment
of Justice S.H. Kapadia, as His Lordship then was, it is
observed that there is distinction between “right to
apply       for   compensation”        and    “entitlement              to
compensation”. The compensation constitutes part of
the estate of the deceased. As a result, the legal
representative of the deceased would inherit the
estate. Indeed, in that case, the Court was dealing
with the case of a married daughter of the deceased
and       the   efficacy  of    Section    140     of     the       Act.
Nevertheless, the principle underlying the exposition
in this decision would clearly come to the aid of the
respondent Nos. 1 and 2 (claimants) even though
they are major sons of the deceased and also
earning.
15. It is thus settled by now that the legal
representatives of the deceased have a right to apply
for      compensation.   Having          said   that,       it     must
necessarily follow that even the major married and
earning      sons   of    the        deceased       being           legal
representatives      have       a      right    to      apply          for
compensation and it would be the bounden duty of
the Tribunal to consider the application irrespective
of      the   fact  whether           the    concerned              legal
representative was fully dependent on the deceased
and not to limit the claim towards conventional
heads only…..”
11. Observing the principles as laid down in the above
referred judgments and following the case of Pranay Sethi
(supra), this Court concludes that both the parents are
dependents of the deceased son and are entitled to apply
for compensation. Thus, the observations made by the
learned Tribunal become erroneous. Both the parents are
entitled for the compensation amount under the head of
dependency loss.
12. Learned advocate Mr.Dakshesh Mehta has insisted
upon to consider the average income of last three years
preceding the death of the deceased son. However,
countering the same, learned advocate Mr.Chaglani has
relied upon the judgments in the cases of Pranay Sethi
(supra); Sangita Arya and others vs. Oriental Insurance
Company Limited and others, reported in AIR 2020 SC
2877; Sheela Devi and others vs. Sumit Kumar and others
(First Appeal No.1080 of 2021, decided on 18.04.2022, by
Hon’ble High Court of Allahabad); and The New India
Assurance Company Limited vs. Salmabibi Jainulabedin
Doi (First Appeal No.96 of 2022, decided on 03.03.2022,
by a Coordinate Bench of this Hon’ble Court).
13. In the case of Bhavnaben Shaileshbhai Rank (supra),
relied upon by Mr.Mehta, the observations made by the
Division Bench of this Court is to the effect that the safe
and proper course is to take into consideration the
average income of the last three years preceding the
death, which would indicate the average income of the
deceased as the earning for the last three years prior to
his death. While that observations were made in context
of the circumstances noted by the Division Bench placing
reliance on the judgment of the Hon’ble Apex Court in the
case of ICICI Lombard General Insurance Company Limited
vs. Ajay Kumar Mohanty and another, reported in (2018) 3
SCC 686, wherein it was indicated that it would be apt,
appropriate and safe to take the average income,
inasmuch as in a given case there may be situation where
due to unforeseen circumstances, the income for the last
year could either be less or abysmally on the lower side.
Thus, in that circumstances, the Division Bench had
considered it safe to consider the average income of the
last three years preceding the death of the deceased.
However, a reference is required to be made of the case of
Pranay Sethi (supra) to clarify that while assessing the fact
that whether the deceased was self-employed or had a
fixed salary without the provision for annual increment
etc., it was observed that the Court would take the actual
income at the time of the death and the departure is
permissible only in rare and exceptional cases involving
special circumstances.
14. The very ratio has been adopted in Pranay Sethi’s
case (supra) while considering the aspect of addition
towards the future prospective income of the deceased. In
Sangita Arya and others (supra), the Hon’ble Apex Court
considered the ITRs filed prior to the death of the
deceased which reflects the income of the deceased and
following the case of Sangita Arya and others (supra), the
Hon’ble High Court of Allahabad, in the case of Sheela
Devi and others (supra), and this Hon’ble High Court in the
case of Salmabibi Jainulabedin Doi (supra), has deprecated
the method of assessing the income on the basis of the
aggregate income of last three years and both the Hon’ble
High Court of Allahabad and this Hon’ble Court has thus
considered to assess the income based on the latest
income tax returns to consider the computation of income
and also such income tax returns are considered to be the
base for awarding the future prospective income.
15. Here in this case, the date of accident is 12.10.2006,
whereas as per Exh.32, the ITR return for the Assessment
Year 2006-07 (i.e. for the period from 01.04.2005 to
30.03.2006) was filed on 10.10.2006, i.e. two days prior to
the accident, which shows the income of the previous
year. The income so reflected in Exh.32 is prior to the
death of the deceased, i.e. the income of the earlier year
was assessed. Hence, Exh.32 is the latest and the last
prior to the death of the deceased. Hence, Exh.32 is
required to be considered to assess the income as well as
the future prospective income. As per Exh.32, the yearly
income assessed is Rs.1,05,800=00. Thus, deducting the
income tax of Rs.592=00, the aggregate amount of
Rs.1,05,000=00 per annum would be considered as the
actual income of the deceased and 40% rise in future
prospective income would be considered taking into
consideration the age of the deceased at the time of the
accident as 27 years. Hence, Rs.42,000=00 is added to
the same. Thus, the dependency income would come to
Rs.1,47,000=00 with a multiplier of 17, that is, the total
amount that comes under the head of dependency income
to the parents would be Rs.24,99,000=00. Taking into
consideration total number of dependents, 1/3rd amount
is required to be deducted as personal expenses of the
deceased. Hence, deducting Rs.8,33,000=00 towards the
personal expenses of the deceased, the dependency loss
would come to Rs.16,66,000=00.
16. The chart showing the compensation payable to the
claimants/appellants is as under :
Income of the        Rs. 1,05,000=00
Multiplier of 17     Rs.24,99,000=00
(deceased was        (Rs.1,47,000 x 17)
1/3rd deduction      Rs.16,66,000=00
towards personal (24,99,000-8,33,000)
Funeral and other Rs.      15,000=00         Rs. 1,10,000
17. Both the parents would be entitled to consortium
money in accordance with the judgment in the case of
Magma General Insurance Company Limited and others
(supra). Hence, the total amount under the head of
consortium would be Rs.80,000=00, Rs.15,000=00 under
the head of loss to estate and Rs.15,000=00 towards the
funeral and other misc. expenses following Pranay Sethi’s
18. Thus, in toto, the claimants are entitled to receive
Rs.17,76,000=00     as    compensation.      The       Insurance
Company is directed to deposit the said amount within a
period of ten weeks from the date of receipt of writ of this
order. It is further directed that from the date of
application to the date of the award of the learned
Tribunal dated 30th June 2018, the said amount shall be
deposited with 9% interest per annum, and from 1 st July
2018 till the date of this order, the said amount shall be
deposited with 7.5% interest per annum.
19. The First Appeal is allowed in part to the aforesaid
