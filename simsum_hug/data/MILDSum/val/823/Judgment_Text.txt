1.              Rule.       Rule made returnable forthwith.          With the
consent of the parties, matter is taken up for final hearing at the
admission stage.
2.              By this petition petitioner assails order dated
04.12.2019 passed by the Judge, Family Court, Jalgaon thereby
rejecting petitioner’s application for grant of maintenance
pendente lite under the provisions of Section 24 of the Hindu
Marriage Act, 1955 (for short ‘the Act, 1955’).
3.              Petitioner has instituted Petition A-334/2019 before
the Family Court, Jalgaon seeking annulment of marriage with
respondent. In that application, she filed application at Exhibit-7
under Section 24 of the Act, 1955 for grant of interim
maintenance.           The Family Court has rejected the application
essentially on two counts: that petitioner possesses higher
qualifications and that on her social media status, she had made
declaration to the effect that she had secured job in a company at
4.              Appearing for petitioner Mr. Deshmukh the learned
counsel would submit that mere possession of qualifications by
petitioner could not have been a reason for denial of interim
maintenance in the light of the position that petitioner is actually
jobless. He would submit that capacity or ability to earn is
different from actual earning. He would contend that petitioner
has not been earning anything and despite the factum of absence
of any job to petitioner being established before the Family Court,
the application for interim maintenance has been erroneously
rejected. In support of his contentions Mr. Deshmukh has relied
upon judgment of the Supreme Court in (i) Shailja and Another
Vs. Khobbanna, 2017 DGLS (SC) 419, (ii) Order of the
Rajasthan High Court in Smt. Megha Khandelwa and ors. Vs.
decided on 12.04.2018 and (iii) Order of the Supreme Court dated
10.05.2019 upholding the order passed by the Rajasthan High
5.              So far as the declaration made by petitioner on social
media is concerned, Mr. Deshmukh would contend that no
material was placed on record by the husband to prove that
petitioner actually received any employment or that she has been
working in a particular company. He would submit that petitioner
had randomly received an E-mail offering her job and she has
made declaration about the same on the social media platform. On
verification, the offer was found to be a sham. Mr. Deshmukh has
further relied upon the affidavit of assets and liabilities filed by
husband to contend that he has been earning monthly salary of
6.              Per contra, Mr. Nimbalkar the learned counsel
appearing for respondent opposes the petition and supports the
order passed by the Family Court. Relying on the judgment of
Madhya Pradesh High Court in Mamta Jaiswal Vs. Rajesh
Jaiswal, Mr. Nimbalkar would contend that if the wife is having
ability and capability to earn, but sits ideal, she cannot be
awarded maintenance.        He submits that petitioner possesses
qualification of Masters in Engineering and is in a position to
easily earn a job for herself.    That, therefore, no maintenance
needs to be awarded to her. Referring to the printouts taken from
the account of petitioner of Facebook and Whatsapp Mr.
Nimbalkar would contend that petitioner was not only offered
employment in UK base company having salary of 2000 pounds,
but various reactions given by her to messages congratulating her
would indicate that she had indeed accepted the job offer.
7.              Mr. Nimbalkar would further contend that petitioner
has unjustifiably withdrawn from the company of the husband
within four months of marriage and has levelled reckless
allegations of impotency against respondent. He would submit
that respondent has no other person to maintain, as no child is
born to the couple out of the said wedlock.          He would further
submit that the mother of petitioner is politically connected. That
even petitioner has accepted certain political engagements
indicating thereby she has sufficient sources of income generation.
He would submit that respondent has obtained personal loan of
Rs.15,00,000/- for which he is required to pay EMI of Rs.33,000/-.
Inviting my attention to the cross-examination of petitioner
conducted before the Family Court on 28.06.2022 he would submit
that she admitted in cross-examination that the offer of
appointment issued to her was fake.            Mr. Nimbalkar would
therefore submit that she indulged in conduct of posting a fake
letter of appointment and considering such conduct, this Court
should be loath in grating any equitable relief in her favour He
prays for dismissal of petition.
8.              Rival contentions of the parties now fall for my
consideration.
9.              The Family Court has proceeded to reject petitioner’s
application for interim maintenance essentially on two counts of
possession of higher qualifications and declaration made by her on
social medial platform. It would be profitable to reproduce some
of the observations recorded by the Family Court while rejecting
petitioner’s application for interim maintenance:
“The respondent relied on whatsapp status and Facebook
post of the petitioner to show that she got an employment at
London. The copies of her Whatsapp and Facebook status
are also filed on record. However, such post itself is not
sufficient to make out a case with regard to employment of
the petitioner, but at the same time, it is pertinent to
mention that in the era of social media, the people are
having habit to share their emotions, developments, their
present state of mind through the Social Media. In such
circumstances, considering the qualification and social
media status of the petitioner with regard to getting
employment, cannot be ruled out. Further, as per the
observations in the case of Mamata (supra), the petitioner
being highly educated is not expected to keep herself ideal
and seek maintenance from the respondent.”
10.             Thus the findings recorded by the Family Court would
indicate that it did not arrive at a definitive conclusion that
petitioner actually secured employment or that she has been
working on the post in consequent to the offer of appointment
which was put on the social media platform.                        However,
considering the her qualifications, the Family Court has raised
presumption that the possibility of she securing a job could not be
ruled out. This finding in my opinion appears to be totally
erroneous. The Family Court itself has recorded a finding that
mere publication of a post on social media platform is not
sufficient to make out a case with regard to the employment of
petitioner. Having held so, the Family Court ought not to have
raised a presumption she secured an employment, just because
she possesses higher qualifications.
11.             Apart from the social media post, respondent has not
put on record any other concrete material to prove that petitioner
actually secured any employment or she has been working and
earning. If petitioner is indeed working, respondent could have
produced the relevant papers showing proof of income earned by
her in the form of bank statement, Income Tax Returns etc.
However, nothing of that sort is placed on record.                 It would
therefore safe to assume that petitioner is not engaged in any
employment and has not been earning any income for herself.
12.             Respondent-husband has accused the Petitioner-wife
of indulging in undesirable act of posting a fake letter of
appointment on social media and urged before me to deny any
relief to her on account of her conduct. He has particularly invited
my attention on the reactions given to her post by her friends and
relatives and her acknowledgement and reciprocation of the
congratulatory messages. He has also invited my attention to her
mother’s message on social media platform confirming the job
offer to her daughter. It is submitted that either the information
shared on social media platform should be accepted as true or if
the information is false, she should be denied any relief in
exercise of extraordinary jurisdiction by this court. No doubt, the
act of Petitioner-wife in posting the letter of appointment, which
she later claims to be fake, on social media platform is not
commendable and she should have restrained herself from doing
so without first verifying the genuineness of the offer. It is
difficult to determine at this stage whether she was actually
deceived or was merely attempting to gain praises and popularity
on    social     media     platforms  by posting     factually       incorrect
information. In absence of any concrete proof of actual
employment, an inference cannot be drawn that the offer actually
fructified in a job for her. Having arrived at a conclusion the
Petitioner-wife is actually not employed, in my view, the doors of
the Courts cannot be shut on her, even if her conduct may not be
completely free from blemish.
13.             Coming to the aspect of ability and capability of
petitioner to earn income for herself, no doubt she possesses
qualifications of Masters of Engineering. In Mamta Jaiswal Vs.
Rajesh Jaiswal (supra) relied upon by Mr. Nimbalkar the
Madhya Pradesh High Court has held as under:
“6.      In view of this, the question arises, as to in what way
Section 24 of the Act has to be interpreted: Whether a spouse
who has capacity of earning but chooses to remain idle,
should be permitted to saddle other spouse with his or her
expenditure ? Whether such spouse should be permitted to
get pendente lite alimony at higher rate from other spouse in
such condition ? According to me, Section 24 has been
enacted for the purpose of providing a monetary assistance
to such spouse who is incapable of supporting himself Or
herself inspite of sincere efforts made by him or herself. A
spouse who is well qualified to get the service immediately
with less efforts is not expected to remain idle to squeeze out,
to milk out the other spouse by relieving him of his or her
own purse by a cut in the nature of pendente lite alimony.
The law does not expect the increasing number of such idle
persons who by remaining in the arena of legal battles, try to
squeeze out the adversory by implementing the provisions of
law suitable to their purpose. In the present case Mamta
Jaiswal is a well qualified woman possessing qualification
like M.Sc. M.C. M.Ed. Till 1994 she was serving in
Gulamnabi Azad Education College. It impliedly means that
she was possessing sufficient experience. How such a lady
can remain without service ? It really puts a bug question
which is to be answered by Mamta Jaiswal with sufficient
congent and believable evidence by proving that in spite of
sufficient efforts made by her, she was not able to get service
and, therefore, she is unable to support herself. A lady who is
fighting matrimonial petition filed for divorce, cannot be
permitted to sit idle and to put her burden on the husband
for demanding pendente lite alimony from him during
pendency of such matrimonial petition. Section 24 is not
meant for creating an army of such idle persons who would
be sitting idle waiting for a 'dole' to be awarded by her
husband who has got a grievance against her and who has
gone to the Court for seeking a relief against her. The case
may be vice verssa also. If a husband well qualified,
sufficient enough to earn, site idle and puts his burden on
the wife and waits for a 'dole' to be awarded by remaining
entangled in litigation. That is also not permissible. The law
does not help indolents as well idles so also does not want an
army of self made lazy idles. Everyone has to earn for the
purpose of maintenance of himself or herself, atleast, has to
make sincere efforts in that direction. If this criteria is not
applied, if this attitude is not adopted, there would be a
tendency growing amongst such litigants to prolong such
litigation and to milk out the adversory who happens to be a
spouse, once dear but far away after an emerging of
litigation. If such army is permitted to remain in existence,
there would be no sincere efforts of amicable settlements
because the lazy spouse would be very happy to fight and
frustrate the efforts of amicable settlement because he would
be reaping the money in the nature of pendente lite alimony,
and would prefer to be happy in remaining idle and not
bothering himself or herself for any activity to support and
maintain himself or herself That cannot be treated to be aim,
goal of Section 24. It is indirectly against healthyness of the
society. It has enacted for needy persons who in spite of
sincere efforts and sufficient effort are unable to support and
maintain themselves and are required to fight out the
litigation jeopardising their hard earned income by toiling
working hours.”
14.             However, Mamta Jaiswal (supra) was filed seeking
enhancement of maintenance.         In that judgment, the husband
was earning salary of Rs.5,852/- and wife was awarded
maintenance of Rs.800/-, of whish she sought enhancement. While
dealing with the issue of enhancement, the learned Single Judge
of the Madhya Pradesh High Court has made aforementioned
observations in paragraph no.6 of its judgment.              Thus Mamta
Jaiswal (supra) cannot be said to have laid down a law that a wife
is not entitled for any maintenance merely on account of
possession of higher qualifications. Also of relevance is the fact
that in Mamta Jaiswal (supra), the wife was working in college
till the year 1994 and that aspect has also been taken into
consideration by the High Court while dismissing the petition
seeking enhancement of maintenance. In the present case, it is
not the case of respondent that petitioner was previously
employed and was earning any income.
15.             Mr. Deshmukh has relied upon the decision of the
Apex Court in Shailja (supra), in which it is held has under:
“7.     We are not satisfied with the order passed by the High
Court considering the income of the respondent – husband,
which we have been told, is more than Rs.80,000/- per month
since the respondent – husband is a Senior Lecturer in
college. It is stated by learned counsel for the appellants that
the respondent – husband is also the owner of 26 acres of
irrigated land.”
16.             Thus the Apex Court has made distinction between
capability to earn and actually earning. It is held that merely
because the wife is capable of earning, the same cannot be a
reason to reduce maintenance awarded by the Family Court.
17.             In Megha Khandelwal (supra) the Rajasthan High
Court was concerned with the issue of enhancement of
maintenance awarded to the wife. The petition for enhancement
was opposed by placing reliance on qualification of Degree of MSC
(Biotechnology) and preparation for PHED by the wife. Despite
this, the High Court proceeded to enhance the maintenance from
Rs.5000/- to Rs.9000/-. The matter was carried before the Apex
Court by the wife which was pleased to further enhance the
maintenance to Rs.25,000/-.
18.             The position of law thus appears to be that mere
possession of qualifications by wife who is admittedly not
employed, cannot ipso facto be a reason to deny interim
maintenance altogether.
19.             The respondent husband has failed to prove that
petitioner is actually employed. The political position allegedly
occupied by her mother is totally irrelevant. Also of irrelevance
are the documents produced by respondent to show that petitioner
herself is allegedly occupying some political post.
20.             Coming to the income of husband, in the affidavit of
assets and liabilities filed by him, he has declared his monthly
income as Rs.78,598/-. He is employed on the post of Technical
Consultant in Hitachi Vantara. He has also placed on record his
salary certificate showing gross salary of Rs.76,750/- for the
month of April 2019.         The salary certificate shows that after
statutory deductions, the net salary receivable is Rs.66,050/-. Also
placed on record by respondent husband is his bank statement.
Petitioner has relied upon one of the entries relating to the month
of August 2018 in support of her contention the salary earned by
respondent husband is Rs.1,33,377/-. One stray entry in the bank
statement, in my opinion, cannot be indicative of the exact salary
earned by respondent husband. There is no reasons to disbelieve
the salary certificate placed on record by respondent husband as
well as the statement made in his affidavit of assets and liabilities
showing that his monthly gross salary is Rs.76,750/-.
21.             Taking conspectus of the overall position of Petitioner
being unemployed, possession of higher qualifications by her on
the strength of which she could make an endeavor to secure job as
well as net monthly income of husband as Rs.66,050/-, I am of the
view that ends of justice would meet if petitioner is awarded
interim maintenance of Rs.7500/- during the pendency of the
proceedings before the Family Court.
22.             The proceedings before the Family Court are pending
since the year 2019. It appears that the evidence of petitioner is
in the process of being recorded. In these circumstances, it would
be necessary in the interest of justice to expedite the proceedings
pending before the Family Court. I, therefore, proceed to pass the
A.      The order dated 04.12.2019 passed by the Family Court,
Jalgaon on application at Exhibit-7 in Petition A-334/2019
is set aside. Respondent husband is directed to pay
interim maintenance of Rs.7500/- per month to petitioner
wife from the date of filing of Petition A-334/2019. The
respondent husband to pay arrears of maintenance to
petitioner wife within a period of two months from today.
B.      Hearing of Petition A-334/2019 is expedited and the
Family Court is requested to make an endeavor to decide
the same as expeditiously as possible and preferably
within a period of six months from today. Both the parties
shall cooperate in earlier disposal of the           Petition A-
334/2019          and  shall not  seek     any      unnecessary
C.      With the above directions the petition is partly allowed.
Rule made partly absolute in the above terms.
