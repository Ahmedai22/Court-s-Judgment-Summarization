1.        This Second Review Petition has been preferred by the
petitioner, who appeared in person after dismissal of his first
review petition by this Court bearing No. 3119 of 2020 on 5 th
2. Before adverting to the legal aspect as to whether second
review is tenable in the given facts and circumstances, it would
be expedient to briefly consider the background history of the
case.
3. The petitioner was an employee of the respondent-bank. A
disciplinary proceeding initiated against him on the ground of
unauthorized absence from the service between 21 st August,
1994 to 14th September, 1995, came to be unsuccessfully
challenged by him before the Trial and the First Appellate
Court. However, it was proved before the Courts below that
the petitioner’s absence till 30th September, 1994 was
authorized. There was nothing to show that the petitioner’s
admitted absence from service after 1 st October, 1994 and until
14th September 1995, when the charge-sheet was issued against
him on the ground of unauthorized absenteeism, was
authorized.
4. The petitioner’s case before the Enquiry Officer as well as the
Courts below was that he was entitled to voluntary retirement
from the service w.e.f. 1st October, 1994 and that his application
seeking voluntary retirement was not accepted by the
respondent-employer on the ground that the voluntary
retirement was not in force. The petitioner had placed reliance
on a circular of Indian Banks Association, dated 4 th January,
1996 by contending that the voluntary retirement scheme in
terms of the settlement with the unions under the Industrial
Dispute Act, was a binding settlement and the employees of the
RPW-3 of 2022-Jud=.doc
banks were entitled to the benefit of the settlement from the
date mentioned therein, i.e. 1st November, 1993. While
dismissing Second Appeal of the petitioner, this Court in its
order dated 4th November, 2019 has categorically observed in
paragraph nos.3 and 4, which is extracted below :-
“3.      The controversy in the present case is not
whether or not the Respondent-bank rightly refused to
accept the Appellant’s application for voluntary
retirement, though it was bound to accept such
application. The fact of the matter is that it did not do
so at the relevant time. If the Appellant was aggrieved
by the bank’s refusal to accept his voluntary application,
his remedy was to get the bank accept it by invoking the
appropriate provisions of law. He did not do so. He
simply cannot chose to remain absent on the ground
that he was deemed to have voluntarily retired on the
basis of the applicable scheme and his application made
in response thereof. The Enquiry Officer as well as the
Disciplinary Authority and the two courts cannot
accordingly be said to have erred in passing the
impugned orders. The charge against the Appellant was
that he was absent without a proper authorization.
Though the charge that he was absent with effect from
21 August 1994 was not proved, what was proved was
that he was absent unauthorizedly with effect from 1
October 1994 and till 15 September 1995, when a show-
cause notice was issued to him. It is no answer to this
charge of unauthorized absence that the bank was
legally bound to consider the application for voluntary
retirement preferred by the employee.
4.       On these facts and in the light of the impugned
decisions of the two courts below, no substantial
question of law arises in the matter for consideration of
this court. The Second Appeal, thus, has no merit and is
dismissed accordingly.”
5. Dissatisfied with the dismissal of the Second Appeal, the
petitioner preferred First Review Petition (St.) No.3119 of
2020, which also came to be dismissed by the same Hon’ble
Judge on 5th October, 2020. Paragraph nos. 4 to 6 of the oral
judgment are extracted below for advantage, which read thus :-
“4.      The ground urged by the Petitioner is no ground
for seeking review of the order passed by this Court on 4
November 2019. The order itself, as noted above, made
it clear that the question before the Court was not
whether or not the Respondent-bank rightly refused to
accept the Petitioner’s application for voluntary
retirement with effect from 1 October 2014. The fact of
the matter is that it did not accept the application, and if
that was so, the Petitioner could not have simply chosen
to remain absent on the ground that he was deemed to
have voluntarily retired on the basis of a scheme and his
application made in response thereof. This court found
nothing wrong with the conclusion of the courts below
that the Petitioner could not have done so and,
therefore, the unauthorized character of his absence
from service between 1 October 1994 and 14 September
1995 (i.e. the date of his charge-sheet) was clearly
proved. No substantial question of law accordingly
arose for consideration of this court.
5.       There is no new or important matter or
evidence, which, despite exercise of due diligence, was
not within the knowledge of the Review-Petitioner, or
which could not be produced by him, at the time when
the order was made, which is brought to the notice of
this court. Likewise, there is neither an error apparent
on the face of the order nor sufficient reason to obtain a
review of the order.
6.       There is, accordingly, no merit in the review
petition. The petition is dismissed.”
RPW-3 of 2022-Jud=.doc
6. As a matter of fact, Order 47, Rule 9 of the Code of Civil
Procedure specifically bars second review.      Order 47 Rule 9
“R.9. Bar of certain applications. – No application to
review an order made on an application for a review or
a decree or order passed or made on a review shall be
entertained.”
7. The Second Review, therefore, cannot be entertained, but for
following few reasons, I am constrained to make a few
important observations against the petitioner in light of a
chequered history.
8. Since the petitioner was unable to put-forth his case properly
before this Court, it was suggested to engage a Counsel of his
choice. However, the petitioner submitted that “he can argue
better than any advocate”. In the second review petition, the
petitioner has literally reproduced and reiterated almost
everything what has been stated by him in the Second Appeal
as well as in his first review petition save and except anything
to show as to how second review is tenable.            The grounds
raised by him cannot be said to be the grounds for seeking
second review of the order passed by this Court on 4 th
November, 2019. It is not the contention of the petitioner that
there was discovery of new and important matters or evidence
which, after the exercise of due diligence was not within his
knowledge or could not be produced by him at the time when
the decree passed or order made, or on account of some
mistake or error apparent on the face of the record, or for any
other sufficient reason. This has been clearly observed by this
RPW-3 of 2022-Jud=.doc
Court while dismissing the first review petition. The power of
review can be exercised for correction of a mistake and not to
substitute a view.     The error contemplated under Order 47
Rule 1, must be such which is apparent on the face of the
record and not an error which has to be searched.           It must be
an error of inadvertence which does not require any long
drawn process of hearing.
9.  Indubitably, the petitioner had preferred a Writ Petition
No.2553 of 2019 before a Division Bench of this Court, which
came to be dismissed on 25 th January, 2022 (Coram : Dipankar
Datta, CJ & M.S. Karnik, J). This is a classic example of abuse
of process of Court as well as law, wherein, the petitioner has
left no stone unturned to abuse the process not only by
preferring second review which is not tenable in law, but also
by filing multiple proceedings before different Courts. Even
before institution of Special Civil Suit No.40 of 2000,
petitioner had filed a Writ Petition No.1228 of 1997 wherein a
challenge was laid to the departmental inquiry.               The said
petition was disposed of on 6 th September, 2001 by a co-
ordinate bench of this Court with the following order:-
“Civil Application as well as Writ Petition allowed to be
withdrawn.
Authenticated copy be made available to the
petitioner’s Counsel”.
10. The petitioner, thereafter, had instituted 10 Criminal Writ
Petitions and several Civil Writ Petitions from the year 2004 to
2014, together with miscellaneous applications therein. In none
of those petitions, petitioner appear to have gained any
RPW-3 of 2022-Jud=.doc
concrete relief qua the proceedings initiated by his employer –
Bank leading to termination of his services.          He had even
approached the Supreme Court under Article 136 of the
Constitution of India against the order dated 14 th October, 2016
passed by the co-ordinate bench of this Court. However, his
Special Leave Petition came to be dismissed with a direction to
the Civil Court to expedite its decision in Special Civil Suit
No.40 of 2000.
11. During the pendency of Writ Petition No. 2553 of 2019, an
attempt was made by the petitioner to seek relief before the
Supreme Court by instituting the proceedings under Article 32
of the Constitution of India on 10 th May, 2019 giving rise to
Writ Petition (C) No. 787 of 2019.    The Supreme Court by an
order dated 25th October, 2019 dismissed the writ petition by
passing the following order :-
“Upon perusing papers the Court made the following
Permission to appear and argue in person is allowed.
We are not inclined to entertain this petition under
Article 32 of the Constitution of India.
The writ petition is, accordingly, dismissed.
Pending applications stand disposed of.”
12. The prayers made by the petitioner before the Supreme Court
“a)      this Hon’ble Court may set aside the order
dated 01.10.1996 issued by the respondent-Bank by
which the petitioner is removed from service;
b)       this Hon’ble Court may declare that the charge-
sheet issued by the respondent-Bank dated 14.09.1995
RPW-3 of 2022-Jud=.doc
against the petitioner may be quashed;
c)        this Hon’ble Court may declare that the order
dated 18.07.2017 passed by the Hon’ble District Court,
Pune in Civil Appeal No.503 of 2016 as null and void;
d)        this Hon’ble Court may consider the period
from 01.10.1994 to 01.10.1996 as “DIES-NON”.
e)        this Hon’ble Court may pass an order to the
respondent-Bank to declare the petitioner as deemed to
be in service from 01.10.1994 till the retirement on
superannuation i.e. 31.10.2012, with entitlement for
deemed promotion upto officer grade VII of the Bank;
f)        the respondent-Bank be ordered to pay the
eligible pension to the petitioner from 01.11.2012;
g)        the respondent-Bank be ordered to pay
damages of Rs.23,75,000/- to petitioner for malfeasance
acts. The interest @ 18% p.a. may be ordered from
01.10.1996 to realization of amount.
h)        the respondent-Bank be ordered to pay interest
@ 18% p.a. at bank lending rate of interest on salary
and pension till realization of amount;
i)        the respondent-Bank be ordered to pay
unliquidated damages amounting to Indian Rupees 25/-
Crores (Rupees twenty-five crores) in addition to pay
damages of Rs.23,75 lacs to petitioner on which Court
j)        the respondent-Bank be ordered to pay the cost
of the litigation;
k)        such any other or further order/orders may be
passed as this Hon’ble Court may deem fit and proper in
the facts and circumstances of the case.”
13. The petitioner had suppressed pendency of Writ Petition in the
Supreme Court before this Court and, therefore, he can be said
to be guilty of suppressing of material facts, which also
amounts to abuse of process of Court as well as of law.
14. It would be apposite to extract paragraph nos.17 to 22 of the
order dated 25th January, 2022 passed by the Division Bench of
RPW-3 of 2022-Jud=.doc
this Court in Writ Petition No. 2553 of 2019, which read thus:-
“17.     Prayers (a) to (d) quoted above, simply cannot
be entertained. The second appeal of the petitioner
having been dismissed, the petitioner’s attempt to have
the order reviewed has also not met with success. The
lis in such second appeal does not survive. No order in
terms of prayer (a) can thus be granted. In so far as
prayers (b) and (c) are concerned, the same were the
subject matter of challenge in Special Civil Suit No.40 of
2000 and the issue has attained finality with dismissal of
the petition filed by the petitioner seeking review of the
second appellate order under section 100 of the CPC
read with Order XLI Rule 11 thereof. Prayer (d) of the
writ petition is also thoroughly misconceived. The
judgment and decree of the first appellate court dated
18th July, 2017 having been challenged in a second
appeal under section 100 of the CPC, we wonder how
the same order could be a subject matter of challenge in
a different proceeding, and that too, in a writ petition.
The other prayers vide prayer clauses (e) to (k) relate to
the subject matter of Special Civil Suit No.40 of 2000.
This Court, albeit in a different jurisdiction, having dealt
with the disciplinary proceedings including the charge-
sheet, the inquiry and the order of removal, the present
writ petition is plainly not maintainable being barred by
res judicata and analogous principles.
18.      In our view, the petitioner not having pursued
this writ petition and having approached the Supreme
Court for substantially the same relief as claimed herein,
the conclusion is inescapable that there had been a
temporary abandonment of this writ petition and only
after being unsuccessful before the Supreme Court that
the petitioner is seeking to take a chance before us once
again.
19.      Since the petitioner had appealed to us that we
ought to look into his written notes of argument and
decide his claims, we have looked into the same. Such
notes are replete with contentions as to how the
disciplinary proceedings initiated against the petitioner
RPW-3 of 2022-Jud=.doc
together with the order of removal are bad in law and
ought to be invalidated as such. We are afraid, the issue
having attained finality cannot be reopened by this
proceeding.
20.     We would have been justified in imposing
exemplary costs on the petitioner for having abused the
process of Court as well as law; however, bearing in
mind that the petitioner is in the winter years of his life,
and may not have received proper legal advice or may
have even faltered by reason of his lack of legal
knowledge, we refrain from imposing such costs.
21.     The writ petition, accordingly, stands dismissed.
22.     We make it clear that if the petitioner seeks to
approach this Court in future raising any grievance with
regard to the subject matter of Special Civil Suit No.40
of 2000 by instituting any proceeding, he would be
adequately dealt with.”
15.   Despite clearly indicating to the petitioner as regards the
observation made by the Division Bench of this Court in Writ
Petition No. 2553 of 2019, especially, by inviting his attention
to the observations made in paragraph 20, 21 and 22 of which,
the petitioner is already aware, he insisted for deciding this
second review. The petitioner herein had sought second review
on the premise that this Court is sitting in an appeal over its
first review. A rehearing of the matter is impermissible in law.
Review is not an appeal in disguise.
16.   The petitioner has also placed reliance on a judgment of the
Supreme Court in case of Jaya Chandra Mohapatra Vs. Land
Acquisition Officer, Rayagada1 I am afraid, the ratio laid down
therein would not be of any help to the petitioner for the
RPW-3 of 2022-Jud=.doc
simple reason that it has been held and I quote paragraph 8,
which reads thus :-
applications for review successively if the same
are otherwise maintainable in law. The civil
court herein admittedly had not granted to the
appellant the benefit of solatium at the rate of
30% of the amount of enhanced compensation
as also the additional amount and interest as
contemplated under the amending Act of 1984.
To the said benefits, the appellant was entitled
to in terms of Section 23 (1-A), Section 23 (2)
as also Section 28 of the Act. It is one thing to
say that the omission to award additional
amount under Section 23 (1-A), enhanced
interest under Section 28 and solatium under
Section 23 (2) may not amount to clerical or
arithmetical mistake in relation whereto an
executing court will not be entitled to grant
relief but it is another thing to say that the
grant thereof would be impressible in law even
if the Reference Court on an appropriate
application made in this behalf and upon
application of its mind holds that the statutory
benefits available to the claimant had not been
granted to him and pass an order in that behalf
by directing amendment of decree. In a case of
former nature, an executing court may not
have any jurisdiction to pass such an order on
the ground that it cannot go behind the decree,
but in law there does not exist any bar on a
Reference Court to review its earlier order if
there exists an error apparent on the face of
the record in terms of Order-47 Rule 1 of the
Code of Civil Procedure. Such a jurisdiction
cannot be denied to the Reference Court. Act
68 of 1984 is a beneficial statute and thus, the
benefits arising thereunder cannot ordinarily
be denied to a claimant except on strong and
cogent reasons”.
17. For the reasons already stated hereinabove, there is neither any
clerical or arithmetical mistake nor any discovery of new or
important matter or evidence, which the petitioner could not
notice despite due diligence.
18. Since 2009, till date valuable time of this Court had been
consumed by the petitioner by filing frivolous litigation.
Despite a clear warning of this Court in Writ Petition No.2553
of 2019, the petitioner was hell-bent in prosecuting second
review petition.    Such conduct is highly deprecated as the
petitioner appears to be incorrigible.
19. The petitioner cannot be said to be unmindful of his several
unsuccessful attempts and its ultimate fate. He is not a naive
person. He is, indeed, fully aware that he has been fighting a
lost legal battle which has no merit at all.       Looking to the
overall conduct of the petitioner, there can hardly be any
reason to take a sympathetic view due to his advanced age.
Such tendencies need to be nipped in the bud by imposing
exemplary costs. Such elements cannot be permitted to take the
system for a ride by filing unmerited multiple proceedings and
to drag the proceedings unendlessly.
20. I, therefore, reject the review petition by imposing exemplary
costs on the petitioner in the sum of Rs.1,00,000/- (Rupees
One Lakh only). The petitioner shall deposit the costs with the
Registry of this Court within three weeks from today.
21. After depositing the amount, Registry shall transmit the said
RPW-3 of 2022-Jud=.doc
amount to “The Bombay Mothers and Children Welfare
Society” having its address at 10, B.D.D. Chawls, N.M. Joshi
Marg, Lower Parel, Mumbai – 400 013. The Bank details of
said Society are as under :-
Bank                    : State Bank of India
22. If the petitioner fails to deposit the amount of costs as stated in
paragraph 20, it be recovered by the Collector, Pune from
petitioner’s arrears of land revenue. The Collector, thereafter,
shall submit a report of compliance to this Court on or before
5th September, 2022. Hard as well as soft copy of this judgment
be sent to Collector, Pune, in case, the petitioner fails to deposit
amount of costs as directed hereinabove within three weeks
from today.
23. The Review Petition is dismissed in the aforesaid terms.
