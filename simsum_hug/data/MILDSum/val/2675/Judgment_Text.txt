1. A well merited judgment of the Court of Sessions acquitting two young men
accused of murdering a police officer, was overturned by the High Court
convicting them for life. Seeking to set themselves at liberty, these appeals are
before us.
2. We have heard learned counsel appearing for the parties, perused documents
and the written arguments filled. Incidentally we called for the trial court
records and went through them.
3. PW-4 and PW-5 are brothers. The deceased was the maternal uncle of the
aforesaid two witnesses. They attacked the mother of A-1 leading to a
complaint given to PW-1, Sub-Inspector of Police.
4. Not satisfied with the registration of the first information report qua the offence
at the hands of PW-1, a complaint was given before the Lokayukta by A-1.
Incidentally, PW-1 was suspended. He was facing other charges as well. It was
in vogue even at the time of giving evidence.
5. On the aforesaid motive, both the accused carried three weapons, waylaid the
deceased at a signal in a main road at about 5 p.m. and after the initial attack,
dragged him to the pavement, and thereafter inflicted multiple injuries. Both
the accused and the deceased were travelling in two-wheelers. PW-1, who was
working in a police station, a bit far away, was coming from his house after
taking lunch. He was a chance witness. He saw the occurrence from a fair
distance. He was known to the deceased. The deceased had his intestine
coming out. The deceased told him the story implicating the accused.
Preceding PW-1, PW-2 was present at the scene. He was also a police head
constable. Both        PW-1 and PW-2 are working in the traffic department. He
heard the statement made by the deceased, as one of the accused threw a
weapon at PW-2, which recovery was shown subsequently at a different open
place, as is the case of the other recoveries. PW-1, thereafter, chased the
accused but could not secure them. The statements made by PW-1 and PW-2
differ with respect to the street.
6. PW-1 and PW-2 stopped an auto and placed the deceased into it along with one
Ramesh, since deceased (not examined). Incidentally, he is not only known to
PW-1 but also a friend of the deceased and thus, yet another chance witness.
7. PW-1, thereafter, went to the police station and gave an oral complaint which
was admittedly not registered. Thereafter, PW-1 came to the hospital which
was about two kilometres from the place of occurrence, while another nursing
home was in existence at about 50 meters. The hospital in which the deceased
was admitted was run by PW-25, a doctor very well known to PW-1.
8. PW-25 gave treatment to the deceased at about 5.05 p.m. He died of multiple
injuries caused by haemorrhage at about 5.45 p.m. The case sheet indicates that
the deceased was allegedly attacked by two known persons, namely the
accused. About 40 days thereafter – i.e., 03.12.2001, at the request of the
police, PW-25 gave another certificate introducing adequate material to
indicate that there was a dying declaration.
9. In the meanwhile, PW-1 went to the police station for the second time and gave
a complaint which was registered by PW-28 at about 6 p.m. PW-28 is the
investigating officer, who did his part by completing it and filed the final report
with the major offences being Section 302, Section 506-B, and Section 120B
r/w Section 34 of Indian Penal Code.
10.Before the trial court, the prosecution examined as many as 28 witnesses and
marked Exhibit P-1 to P-60. Material objects are marked as MO-1 to MO-17.
On behalf of the defence, a doctor was examined to show that considering the
nature of the injuries suffered, the death must have been instantaneous. Certain
portions of Section 161 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (hereinafter
referred to as ‘CrPC’) statements given by the prosecution witnesses have been
marked to contradict their deposition before the Court.
11.The Court of Sessions without exception, threadbare considered all the
materials including the witnesses who turned hostile. Most of the witnesses
pertaining to conspiracy, occurrence, recovery and extraordinary judicial
confession turned hostile. After due scrutiny, benefit of doubt was extended in
favour of the appellants.
12.The State took the case on appeal before the High Court. The High Court did
not consider the entire evidence as discussed by the trial court. Nonetheless, it
reversed the order of acquittal on the following grounds:
 The Trial Court had no idea of the concept of dying declaration and the
principle governing it.
 The testimony of PWs 3, 4 and 5 ought to be read in unison and in
conjunction with each other to come to an inference of motive.
 The testimony of PWs 1, 2 and 25 ought to have been accepted.
 The contradictions between the testimony of PW-2 and the statement
under Section 161 CrPC, would only mean that the investigating
officer was leaning towards the accused.
 The medical evidence along with the documents marked clearly point
out the guilt towards the accused.
 The fact that the witnesses turned hostile including the panch witness
who signed the recovery memos would not be fatal to the case of the
prosecution.
13.Accordingly, the judgment of the trial court was reversed and conviction was
rendered sentencing the appellants for life.
14.The learned counsel appearing for the appellants submitted that it is not
probable that PW-1 could have been present on that day as a chance witness.
He was having a grudge against the accused. At their instance he was facing
departmental proceedings. The trial court has considered the evidence
thoroughly. It found that PW-1 could not have been a chance witness and there
are many discrepancies in his evidence and the testimony of PW-2. He did not
use his wireless radio nor make any attempt immediately to give a complaint.
He did not accompany the deceased, as reiterated by PW-2 being contradictory
to that of Ex. P-41 read with the evidence of PW-25. It is inexplicable that the
deceased would be taken to the hospital 2 kilometres away, while leaving the
one on the road just about 50 meters away, especially taking note of the serious
condition of the deceased. It is further submitted that PW-2’s evidence was
rightly disbelieved by the trial court in view of the contradictions in the
evidence adduced by him and PW-1, and also PW-16. He also did not give a
complaint despite being a police officer. The trial court rightly noted that it
would be unsafe to rely upon the evidence of PW-1 and PW-2.
15.The recovery shown also belies the case as put up by PW-2 with respect to an
attempt to attack him by throwing one of the material objects at him. There was
an admitted contradiction between the statement given by PW-2 before the
Court and in his Section 161 CrPC statement as acknowledged by PW-28. The
High Court straightaway came to the conclusion that PW-28 was supporting
the accused, as all of them are the police officers known to each other. Even the
occurrence has been spoken differently by PW-1 and PW-2.
16.The High Court ought not have made reliance upon Ex. P38 - P41. Ex. P-38 is
highly doubtful, however, the same has been improved by Ex. P-41 by
introducing the concept of dying declaration after about 40 days, which
document came into existence on the insistence of the police which could be
proved through the evidence of PW-25 himself.
17.Thus, when the trial court which had the advantage of seeing the witnesses in
person during their deposition gave its verdict, it could not have been set aside
through a cryptic order by the High Court without adequate discussion. The
High Court ought not to have reversed the decision on the basis of a so-called
dying declaration.
18.The counsel seeks support for his argument by placing reliance upon the
 Jayamma & Anr. vs. State of Karnataka (2021) 6 SCC 213
 Paparambaka Rosamma & Ors. vs State of A.P. (1999) 7 SCC 695
 Surinder Kumar vs. State of Haryana (2011) 10 SCC 173
 Chandrappa vs. State of Karnataka (2007) 4 SCC 415
 Rajendra Prasad vs. State of Bihar (1977) 2 SCC 205
 Padmanabhan Vijaykumar vs. State of Kerela (1994) Supp. 2 SCC 156
 Amar Singh vs. State of NCT of Delhi (2020) SCC Online SC 826
 Narayana Reddy alias Babu vs. State of Karnataka (2016) 14 SCC 212
 A Shanker vs. State of Karnataka (2011) 6 SCC 279
 Selvaraj vs. State of Tamil Nadu (1976) 4 SCC 343
 Pradeep Narayan Madgaonkar vs. State of Maharashtra (1995) 4 SCC
19.The learned counsel appearing for the State submitted that the High Court has
correctly relied upon the evidence of PWs 1, 2 and 25. PW-25 is an
independent witness. Merely because PW-1 and PW-2 are the police officers,
their evidence cannot be disbelieved. The High Court also took into
consideration the documents marked on the side of the prosecution. As relevant
materials were indeed taken into consideration, there is no need for interference
particularly when we are dealing with a case of homicide of a police officer.
20.Section 378 CrPC enables the State to prefer an appeal against an order of
acquittal. Section 384 CrPC speaks of the powers that can be exercised by the
Appellate Court. When the trial court renders its decision by acquitting the
accused, presumption of innocence gathers strength before the Appellate Court.
As a consequence, the onus on the prosecution becomes more burdensome as
there is a double presumption of innocence. Certainly, the court of first instance
has its own advantages in delivering its verdict, which is to see the witnesses in
person while they depose. The Appellate Court is expected to involve itself in a
deeper, studied scrutiny of not only the evidence before it, but is duty bound to
satisfy itself whether the decision of the trial court is both possible and
plausible view. When two views are possible, the one taken by the trial court in
a case of acquittal is to be followed on the touchstone of liberty along with the
advantage of having seen the witnesses. Article 21 of the Constitution of India
also aids the accused after acquittal in a certain way, though not absolute.
Suffice it is to state that the Appellate Court shall remind itself of the role
required to play, while dealing with a case of an acquittal.
21.Every case has its own journey towards the truth and it is the Court’s role
undertake. Truth has to be found on the basis of evidence available before it.
There is no room for subjectivity nor the nature of offence affects its
performance. We have a hierarchy of courts in dealing with cases. An Appellate
Court shall not expect the trial court to act in a particular way depending upon
the sensitivity of the case. Rather it should be appreciated if a trial court
decides a case on its own merit despite its sensitivity.
22.At times, courts do have their constraints. We find, different decisions being
made by different courts, namely, trial court on the one hand and the Appellate
Courts on the other. If such decisions are made due to institutional constraints,
they do not augur well. The district judiciary is expected to be the foundational
court, and therefore, should have the freedom of mind to decide a case on its
own merit or else it might become a stereotyped one rendering conviction on a
moral platform. Indictment and condemnation over a decision rendered, on
considering all the materials placed before it, should be avoided. The Appellate
Court is expected to maintain a degree of caution before making any remark.
23.This court, time and again has laid down the law on the scope of inquiry by an
Appellate court while dealing with an appeal against acquittal under Section
378 CrPC. We do not wish to multiply the aforesaid principle except placing
reliance on a recent decision of this court in Anwar Ali and Anr. v. State of
14.2. When can the findings of fact recorded by a court be held to be
perverse has been dealt with and considered in paragraph 20 of the aforesaid
decision, which reads as under: (Babu case [Babu v. State of Kerala, (2010)
“20. The findings of fact recorded by a court can be held to be
perverse if the findings have been arrived at by ignoring or excluding
relevant     material      or   by     taking    into      consideration
irrelevant/inadmissible material. The finding may also be said to be
perverse if it is “against the weight of evidence”, or if the finding so
outrageously defies logic as to suffer from the vice of irrationality.
(Vide Rajinder Kumar Kindra v. Delhi Admn. [Rajinder Kumar
Kindra v. Delhi Admn., (1984) 4 SCC 635 : 1985 SCC (L&S)
131] , Excise & Taxation Officer-cum-Assessing Authority v. Gopi
Authority v. Gopi Nath & Sons, 1992 Supp (2) SCC 312] , Triveni

Bala Koteswara Rao v. State of A.P., (2009) 10 SCC 636 : (2010) 1
It is further observed, after following the decision of this Court in Kuldeep
Singh v. Commr. of Police [Kuldeep Singh v. Commr. of Police, (1999) 2
SCC 10: 1999 SCC (L&S) 429], that if a decision is arrived at on the basis
of no evidence or thoroughly unreliable evidence and no reasonable person
would act upon it, the order would be perverse. But if there is some
evidence on record which is acceptable and which could be relied upon, the
conclusions would not be treated as perverse and the findings would not be
interfered with.
14.3. In the recent decision of Vijay Mohan Singh [Vijay Mohan
Singh v. State of Karnataka, (2019) 5 SCC 436: (2019) 2 SCC (Cri) 586],
this Court again had an occasion to consider the scope of Section 378 CrPC
and the interference by the High Court [State of Karnataka v. Vijay Mohan
Singh, 2013 SCC OnLine Kar 10732] in an appeal against acquittal. This
Court considered a catena of decisions of this Court right from 1952
onwards. In para 31, it is observed and held as under:
“31. An identical question came to be considered before this Court
in Umedbhai Jadavbhai [Umedbhai Jadavbhai v. State of Gujarat,
(1978) 1 SCC 228: 1978 SCC (Cri) 108]. In the case before this Court,
the High Court interfered with the order of acquittal passed by the
learned trial court on reappreciation of the entire evidence on record.
However, the High Court, while reversing the acquittal, did not
consider the reasons given by the learned trial court while acquitting
the accused. Confirming the judgment of the High Court, this Court
‘10. Once the appeal was rightly entertained against the order of
acquittal, the High Court was entitled to reappreciate the entire
evidence independently and come to its own conclusion.
Ordinarily, the High Court would give due importance to the
opinion of the Sessions Judge if the same were arrived at after
proper appreciation of the evidence. This rule will not be
applicable in the present case where the Sessions Judge has
made an absolutely wrong assumption of a very material and
clinching aspect in the peculiar circumstances of the case.’
31.1. In Sambasivan [Sambasivan v. State of Kerala, (1998) 5 SCC
412: 1998 SCC (Cri) 1320], the High Court reversed the order of
acquittal passed by the learned trial court and held the accused guilty
on reappreciation of the entire evidence on record, however, the High
Court did not record its conclusion on the question whether the
approach of the trial court in dealing with the evidence was patently
illegal or the conclusions arrived at by it were wholly untenable.
Confirming the order passed by the High Court convicting the accused
on reversal of the acquittal passed by the learned trial court, after
being satisfied that the order of acquittal passed by the learned trial
court was perverse and suffered from infirmities, this Court declined
to interfere with the order of conviction passed by the High Court.
While confirming the order of conviction passed by the High Court,
‘8. We have perused the judgment under appeal to ascertain
whether the High Court has conformed to the aforementioned
principles. We find that the High Court has not strictly
proceeded in the manner laid down by this Court in Doshi
case [Ramesh Babulal Doshi v. State of Gujarat, (1996) 9 SCC
225 : 1996 SCC (Cri) 972] viz. first recording its conclusion on
the question whether the approach of the trial court in dealing
with the evidence was patently illegal or the conclusions arrived
at by it were wholly untenable, which alone will justify
interference in an order of acquittal though the High Court has
rendered a well-considered judgment duly meeting all the
contentions raised before it. But then will this non-compliance
per se justify setting aside the judgment under appeal? We think,
not. In our view, in such a case, the approach of the court which
is considering the validity of the judgment of an appellate court
which has reversed the order of acquittal passed by the trial
court, should be to satisfy itself if the approach of the trial court
in dealing with the evidence was patently illegal or conclusions
arrived at by it are demonstrably unsustainable and whether the
judgment of the appellate court is free from those infirmities; if
so to hold that the trial court judgment warranted interference. In
such a case, there is obviously no reason why the appellate
court's judgment should be disturbed. But if on the other hand
the court comes to the conclusion that the judgment of the trial
court does not suffer from any infirmity, it cannot but be held
that the interference by the appellate court in the order of
acquittal was not justified; then in such a case the judgment of
the appellate court has to be set aside as of the two reasonable
views, the one in support of the acquittal alone has to stand.
Having regard to the above discussion, we shall proceed to
examine the judgment of the trial court in this case.’
Unnithan v. State of Kerala, (1999) 3 SCC 309 : 1999 SCC (Cri)
410] , after observing that though there is some substance in the
grievance of the learned counsel appearing on behalf of the accused
that the High Court has not adverted to all the reasons given by the
trial Judge for according an order of acquittal, this Court refused to set
aside the order of conviction passed by the High Court after having
found that the approach of the Sessions Judge in recording the order of
acquittal was not proper and the conclusion arrived at by the learned
Sessions Judge on several aspects was unsustainable. This Court
further observed that as the Sessions Judge was not justified in
discarding the relevant/material evidence while acquitting the accused,
the High Court, therefore, was fully entitled to reappreciate the
evidence and record its own conclusion. This Court scrutinised the
evidence of the eyewitnesses and opined that reasons adduced by the
trial court for discarding the testimony of the eyewitnesses were not at
all sound. This Court also observed that as the evaluation of the
evidence made by the trial court was manifestly erroneous and
therefore it was the duty of the High Court to interfere with an order
of acquittal passed by the learned Sessions Judge.
31.3. In Atley [Atley v. State of U.P., AIR 1955 SC 807: 1955 Cri LJ
1653], in para 5, this Court observed and held as under:
‘5. It has been argued by the learned counsel for the appellant
that the judgment of the trial court being one of acquittal, the
High Court should not have set it aside on mere appreciation of
the evidence led on behalf of the prosecution unless it came to
the conclusion that the judgment of the trial Judge was perverse.
In our opinion, it is not correct to say that unless the appellate
court in an appeal under Section 417 CrPC came to the
conclusion that the judgment of acquittal under appeal was
perverse it could not set aside that order.
It has been laid down by this Court that it is open to the High
Court on an appeal against an order of acquittal to review the
entire evidence and to come to its own conclusion, of course,
keeping in view the well-established rule that the presumption of
innocence of the accused is not weakened but strengthened by
the judgment of acquittal passed by the trial court which had the
advantage of observing the demeanour of witnesses whose
evidence have been recorded in its presence.
It is also well settled that the court of appeal has as wide powers
of appreciation of evidence in an appeal against an order of
acquittal as in the case of an appeal against an order of
conviction, subject to the riders that the presumption of
innocence with which the accused person starts in the trial court
continues even up to the appellate stage and that the appellate
court should attach due weight to the opinion of the trial court
which recorded the order of acquittal.
If the appellate court reviews the evidence, keeping those
principles in mind, and comes to a contrary conclusion, the
judgment cannot be said to have been vitiated. (See in this
connection the very cases cited at the Bar, namely, Surajpal
Singh v. State [Surajpal Singh v. State, 1951 SCC 1207: AIR
1952 SC 52]; Wilayat Khan v. State of U.P. [Wilayat
Khan v. State of U.P., 1951 SCC 898: AIR 1953 SC 122]) In our
opinion, there is no substance in the contention raised on behalf
of the appellant that the High Court was not justified in
reviewing the entire evidence and coming to its own
31.4. In K. Gopal Reddy [K. Gopal Reddy v. State of A.P., (1979) 1
SCC 355: 1979 SCC (Cri) 305], this Court has observed that where
the trial court allows itself to be beset with fanciful doubts, rejects
creditworthy evidence for slender reasons and takes a view of the
evidence which is but barely possible, it is the obvious duty of the
High Court to interfere in the interest of justice, lest the administration
of justice be brought to ridicule.”
24.The trial court considered the testimonies of the other witnesses first before
embarking upon eye witnesses and the material witness. It gives exhaustive
reasoning for its ultimate conclusion. We have already recorded the fact that
most of the witnesses turned hostile. PW-16, an independent witness also states
that she has not seen the occurrence and she heard that the deceased was dead
before taking to the hospital. The trial court took enormous pains in
considering the evidence of all the witnesses one by one.
25.On considering the evidence of PW-7, a shoe shop owner, it gives its cogent
reasoning for its non-acceptance. The previous bill and the relevant bill had a
difference of about 8 months in between and this witness has not seen who has
purchased the chappals marked as M.O. 8 from his shop. Similarly, PW-20
who was running an STD booth could not convince the trial court as he could
not say that the accused had made calls from his booth. On motive, it was
correctly analysed that there was nothing to implicate the accused with motive
to murder the deceased.
26.PW-1 was the sterling witness of the prosecution. Certainly, he had an axe to
grind against the accused who had given a complaint against him. He was
facing a departmental enquiry and suspension. It is too strange that he could be
a chance witness. His evidence was thoroughly analysed by the trial court
including the distance between his place of work and his residence. He did not
use his wireless which was not in operation and went to the police station to
give an oral complaint the first time but the same was not registered. PW-25
was known to him and it is surprising as to why no attempt was made to save
the deceased immediately by taking him to the nursing home which was 50
meters away as a normal human conduct. There are many contradictions
between the statements made by PW-1 and PW-2. We are also surprised as to
how the other chance witness Ramesh came to the place, once again, a person
known to the family of the deceased. Though PW-1 denied the complaint
against him, he made an admission that he was under suspension. There was no
bloodstain of the deceased on PW-1 as against PW-2 and the same was also not
matched. We are only noting the above just by way of an illustration. The trial
court went way beyond what we have recorded while disbelieving the evidence
of PW-1.
27.PW-2 was also seen along with PW-1. He was another eye witness. He was a
duty constable. The trial court rightly doubted his presence as well. Once again,
even this witness has not given any complaint. We are dealing with the
deposition of a police officer who is expected to know his duty. While PW-2
did not make a complaint but went on to do his duty, PW-1 did not attend to his
duty thereafter or informed the police station in which he was posted. Though,
PW-2 has stated that accused made an attempt to attack him by throwing one of
the material objects, even the High Court has disbelieved that. The said
material object was recovered from some other place as could be seen from the
recovery memo, despite the fact that it was nobody’s case that the accused
retrieved the same and kept it with them while being chased.
28.PW-25 is the doctor who is well known to PW-1. While PW-1 deposed that he
did not actually accompany the deceased, PW-25 did make a statement that
both the police and public admitted the deceased. This witness did admit that
exhibit Ex. P-41 made a mention that the deceased was brought by PW-1 and
Ramesh. We may note, both PW-1 and PW-2 did not speak about this. He had
also stated that he did not know whether the contents of Ex. P-41 as correct or
not. He acknowledged the fact that he was well known to PW-1 and his family.
29.On a reading of the evidence of PW-25 we do not find any existence of dying
declaration in it. He had deposed that he did not remember whether the
deceased told him that the accused attacked him and caused injuries. It is his
further testimony that he had given Ex. P-41 due to the persistence of the
police. He did not remember whether police asked him to name the accused
under Ex. P-41.
30.We have also perused Exhibit P-38, the case sheet maintained by PW-25.
Exhibit P-38 though makes a mention about the accused, it did not speak about
any statement being made by the deceased about the accused. It is interesting to
note that PW-25 had stated that he did not record the statement of the deceased
and that there were many policemen and general public at the relevant point of
time, which is again a statement contrary to the case put up by the prosecution.
Thus, we are in agreement with the reasoning of the trial court for not
accepting the evidence of PW-25.
31.The defence also examined one witness. This witness is a Government doctor
being an expert in the field of surgery. He had clearly deposed that it would be
impossible for the deceased to be conscious after suffering injuries as
mentioned in Exhibit P-38, which is intestines coming out. The trial court
correctly considered this evidence.
32.Now we may come to the reasoning of the High Court. We feel it is
unnecessary on the part of the High Court to make such strong comments on
the judgment written by the trial court. When the evidence of PWs 1, 2 and 25
were not accepted by the trial court, there cannot be a dying declaration in
existence. The dying declaration was put forth by the prosecution through the
mouth of said three witnesses. As we find, that the evidence let in by them was
found to not be trustworthy, there cannot be any dying declaration either in fact
or in law. The High Court also did not consider the basis upon which the
evidence of PWs 1, 2 and 25 could be accepted and as to how the various
reasons given by the trial court are not acceptable especially when it did not
consider the evidence of the other witnesses. It rendered a conviction on mere
surmise, even though an inference can never be the basis of a conviction when
the testimony of a witness is not believed on cogent reasoning. We do not know
as to how the High Court could give a finding that the investigating officer was
supporting the accused qua the contradiction elicited between Section 161
CrPC statement given by the witness as against deposition before the Court.
We may note that the alleged occurrence was said to have happened at about 5
p.m. on a busy road with heavy traffic and even the evidence of PW-1 and PW-
2 suggests that there were about 1000 persons. Except the evidence of PW-1
and PW-2, there was no other evidence relied upon by the prosecution.
33.In the conspectus of above, we are inclined to hold that the High Court did not
undertake the exercise as mandated under Section 378 read with Section 384
CrPC in reversing the reasoned decision rendered by the trial court. Thus, the
appeals are accordingly allowed. Consequently, the orders of conviction passed
by the High Court stand set aside.
