With regard to the matter of Punjab National
The Senior Superintendent of Police, Muzaffarpur has
appeared in the proceeding virtually along with Mr. Ajay, G.A.-
5. He again submitted that because of the faulty ‘App’ this kind
of cyber crime is happening in the Bank and he had meeting
with the P.N.B. officials and has also found fault in their ‘Apps’.
He has also pointed out that steps have been taken by the Central
Bank of India for minimizing the cyber crimes.
The P.N.B. is directed to consult the Central Bank
of India if they adhere to minimize cyber frauds in Bank and
make necessary modifications in their ‘Apps’ so that people at
large are not cheated by the cyber criminals.
The R.B.I. has filed an affidavit yesterday in the
night and it is not possible for this Court to go through the
affidavit in such short notice.
The matter of P.N.B., R.B.I. and FIU is also
Patna High Court CR. MISC. No.38807 of 2020(13) dt.21-01-2022
adjourned to 27.01.2022.
It is made clear that any affidavit to be filed by any
of the parties has to be filed at least before 24 hours in advance
or if it is filed just before the hearing of the case, the Court will
impose heavy cost upon the parties.
An Interlocutory Application has been filed on
behalf of Mr. Atul Kumar Verma, who has lost money from the
State Bank of India and for that he has also registered a case
bearing Rajiv Nagar P.S. Case No. 217 of 2021 in the Rajiv
Nagar Police Station on 01.06.2021 itself but no action is being
taken by the Police.
This Court understands that local police is
handicapped in investigating the cyber frauds and for that it has
to take help of other police officials of the district. In the opinion
of this Court, any cyber fraud is committed by the cyber
criminals only after the bank account details, phone numbers of
account holders are leaked by the Bank employees.
In the present case, intervenor - applicant namely,
Mr. Atul Kumar Verma, has two accounts in the State Bank of
India, Ashiyana Nagar Branch and has also one account in the
same Bank in Kidwaipuri Branch.
The Senior Superintendent of Police, Patna, is
Patna High Court CR. MISC. No.38807 of 2020(13) dt.21-01-2022
directed to get the case investigated properly by the officials of
the Rajiv Nagar Police Station and take all steps to enquire as to
which Bank employee has leaked the information about the
details of the Bank accounts of those Branches, for that, he is
free to interrogate the Bank officials working in those Branches.
Unless and until this leak is nipped in the bud, the cyber crime
will continue. The Bank Officials are fully involved in such
frauds as recently this Court has been informed by Senior
Superintendent of Police, Muzaffarpur that one of the employees
of the P.N.B. was involved in cyber crime and has been arrested
and without his connivance this kind of crimes could not have
happened.
The Senior Superintendent of Police, Patna, shall
not use this order to arrest the accused but if materials come
during investigation then, he should not spare anybody including
any of the Bank officials.
The Bank is directed to file its reply before the next
date of hearing and should come up with a clear statement as to
when they are going to reverse the cheated amount to the
account holders or they have already reversed the cheated
amount to the account holders.
This issue will again be heard on 27.01.2022.
