1. This matter is taken up through hybrid mode.
2. The present petition has been filed challenging the order
dated 08.04.2008 issued by the Inspector of Schools,
Bhadrak Circle, whereby, the Petitioner assails the
action of the Opposite Parties in not issuing the
appointment order for recruitment to Class-III Non-
Teaching Posts under the Rehabilitation Assistance
Scheme even though the case of the Petitioner was
recommended       for  appointment     by    the  Director,
3. Shorn of unnecessary details, the substratum of matter
presented before this Court remains that the Petitioner’s
father while working as a Primary school teacher died in
harness on 23.02.2001 leaving behind the widow and
two daughters. The Petitioner (married) is the elder
daughter and has +2 Arts qualification. Upon the death
of her father, the Petitioner applied for appointment to
the post of Class-III Non-teaching staffs under the
Rehabilitation Assistance Scheme. On the receipt of the
application form, the necessary distress certificate was
obtained from the Collector and the case of the
Petitioner was recommended for appointment by the
Inspector of Schools.
4. The Director, Secondary Education, Odisha vide
eligibility list in Annexure-4 series shortlisted the
deserving candidates and the name of the petitioner
finds place in the said list at Sl. No. 909. Subsequently,
the petitioner was called for verification of documents
by the Inspector of Schools, Bhadrak Circle vide letter
no. 4335 dated 01.06.2007. In the list prepared by
Inspector of Schools, the name of the petitioner finds
place at Sl. No. 37. However, the lesser deserving
candidates were appointed and the case of the petitioner
was      overlooked    for     appointment    under     the
5. The Petitioner approached the Tribunal in O.A No. 263
of 2008 against such inaction and the same was disposed
of vide order dated 19.02.2008 with a direction to the
Inspector of Schools to dispose of the representation
made by the Petitioner. On receipt of the order passed
by the Tribunal, the Inspector of Schools, Bhadrak Circle
vide order dated 08.04.2008 rejected the claim of the
Petitioner on the ground that it violated Instructions
vide Para No. (i) in Govt. Letter No. 8510/SME dated
6. It is submitted by in Learned Counsel for the Petitioner
that the Inspector of Schools, Bhadrak Circle has not
applied his mind into the matter as no Government
Circular prohibits the married daughter of a deceased
person, in absence of a son, for recruitment under the
Rehabilitation    Assistance      Scheme.  Therefore,   the
Inspector   of   Schools   on       wrong appreciation   of
Government Circular passed the order rejecting the
claim of the Petitioner and the same is liable to be set
aside.
7. Furthermore, it is contended by Learned Counsel for the
Petitioner that the Petitioner, even after her marriage, is
staying at her parent’s house along with her husband
who also has no independent source of income and that
her mother and younger sister have also suggested that
the   employment      under      Rehabilitation  Assistance
Scheme be given to the petitioner keeping in view the
distress condition of the family.
8. Per Contra, it is submitted by Learned Counsel for the
Opposite Parties that in respect of daughters eligible for
appointment      under   the      Rehabilitation Assistance
Scheme, it should be ensured that they are still
unmarried as R.A. Scheme provides for extending
employment to unmarried daughters. Moreover, it was
also contended by Learned Counsel for the Opposite
Parties that the Petitioner’s younger sister who is
unmarried may apply for the requisite benefit under the
9. On perusal of the above-mentioned pleadings, this court
is of the view that marriage by itself is not a
disqualification and impugned policy of the State
Government barring and prohibiting the consideration
of the ‘married’ daughter from seeking appointment
under the Rehabilitation Assistance Scheme, merely on
the ground of marriage, is plainly arbitrary and
violative of constitutional guarantees, as envisaged in
Articles 14, 15, and 16(2) of the Constitution of India.
10.In Umesh Kumar Nagpal v. State of Haryana1 , the
Supreme Court held that the object of compassionate
appointment is to help the family tied over the crisis that
befalls them on the circumstance, so that the family will
not     be  put     to   jeopardy      by  being    driven    to
impecuniosities and condemned by penury. It is for this
reason the emphasis on appointment on compassionate
grounds is immediacy of appointment. This principle
has been laid down in various judgments of the apex
Court and, as such, the compassionate appointment is
by now too well settled that it is not a matter of right
and not an alternate source of recruitment.
11.In the case of C.B. Muthamma v. Union of India2, the
Supreme Court in the context of Indian Foreign Service
(Conduct and Discipline), Rules, 1961, which prohibits
appointment of married woman to such service, held in
paragraphs-6 and 7 as follows:
“At the first blush this rule is in defiance of
Article 16. If a married man has a right, a married
woman, other things being equal, stands on no
worse footing. This misogynous posture is a
hangover of the masculine culture of manacling
the weaker sex forgetting how our struggle for
national freedom was also a battle against
woman’s thralldom. Freedom is indivisible, so is
justice. That our founding faith enshrined in
Articles 14 and 16 should have been tragically
ignored vis-à-vis. half of India’s humanity viz.
our women, is a sad reflection on the distance
between Constitution in the book and law in
action. And if the executive as the surrogate of
Parliament, makes rules in the teeth of Part III
especially when high political office, even
diplomatic assignment has been filled by women,
the inference of diehard allergy to gender parity is
inevitable.
We do not mean to universalize or dogmatise that
men and women are equal in all occupations and
all situations and do not exclude the need to
pragmatise where the requirements of particular
employment, the sensitivities of sex or the
peculiarities of societal sectors or the handicaps of
either sex may compel selectivity. But save where
the differentiation is demonstrable, the rule of
equality must govern.”
Similar view has also been taken by the Bombay High
Court in Ranjana Murlidhar Anerao v.State of
12.In the case of Kshirabadi Bala Behera v. Orissa
Administrative Tribunal4, this Court observed that:
“The Apex Court in number of cases repeatedly
emphasized       the    need     of    compassionate
appointment to the dependent of the deceased
Government servant without any loss of time. The
whole object of granting compassionate
appointment to enable the dependent(s) of
deceased's family to earn bread and butter for the
family and to come out from financial crisis, who
suffers on account of unexpected and untimely
death of deceased/Government servant therefore,
the criteria to grant compassionate appointment
should be ‘dependency’ rather than ‘marriage’. In
a given case, a ‘married’ daughter might be
deserted wife, might have been abandoned wife,
fully dependent upon her father, she might have
been married to an indigent husband so that both
the married daughter and son-in-law could have
been dependent of the bread winner whose death
left them to extreme financial hardship. There
might be many other probabilities in which
married daughter might be fully dependent upon
the income of her father so that the death of the
father to leave her and rest of the family members
in extreme financial hardship. Therefore, the
yardstick for extending the benefit of
compassionate appointment should be dependency
of the dependents on the deceased Government
Servant and their marital status of dependent
should not be impediment for his/her
consideration on compassionate ground to wipe-
out leaves from the eyes of the suffering family on
account of loss of earning member in the family.
A daughter after her marriage doesn't cease to be
daughter of the father or mother and obliged to
maintain their parents and daughter cannot be
allowed to escape its responsibility on the ground
that she is now married, therefore, such a policy of
the State Government disqualifying, a ‘married’
daughter and excluding her from consideration
apart from being arbitrary and discriminating is
retrograde step of State Government as welfare
State, on which stamp of approval cannot be made
by this Court.”
13.As a fallout and consequence of aforesaid discussions,
the order dated 08.04.2008 passed by the Inspector of
Schools cannot be sustained in the eye of the law and
the same is liable to be quashed. As a consequence,
thereof, refusal to grant benefit to the ‘married’
daughter      for    consideration       of    compassionate
appointment is hereby declared void and inoperative.
Hence, the order impugned passed by the authority in
rejecting   the   petitioner’s     case  for   compassionate
appointment is hereby quashed.
14.Accordingly, the opposite parties are directed to
reconsider the claim of the petitioner for being
appointed under Rehabilitation Assistance Scheme
afresh in accordance with law keeping in mind the fact
that her father died on 23.02.2001 and her application
was rejected on 08.04.2008, after seven years.
15. In the result, the Writ Petition is allowed. There shall be
no order as to costs.
