The Punjab and Haryana High Court recently came to the rescue of a father precluded from attending his daughter's convocation at a foreign University, on account of impounding of his passport due to pendency of a criminal case against him.
Simply because a case is pending, would not mean that a person (petitioner) would not return back to India or cannot be brought back to India, said Justice Anoop Chitkara.
 The Judge remarked that in the Indian society, especially when a girl attains pinnacle of education, it brings joy not only to the parents but also makes the entire country proud. Thus, if her parents attend the convocation, it is likely to motivate the child for her further education.
Given above, the court allowed the petition and the petitioner was permitted to go abroad. Court further directed the trial Court to return the passport of the petitioner. Petitioner was allowed to go to Canada subject to certain conditions.
 i)That the petitioner shall procure a smart phone and inform its IMEI number and other details to the SHO/I.O. of the Police station mentioned before. The petitioner shall always keep the phone location/GPS on the "ON" mode. Whenever the Investigating officer asks to share the location, the petitioner shall immediately do so. The petitioner shall neither clear the location history, Whatsapp chats, calls nor format the phone without permission of the concerned SHO/I.O. This condition shall continue till the completion of the trial or closure of case, whatever is earlier. ii) The petitioner shall intimate his address, phone and whatsapp number at Canada to the concerned SHO/I.O.
 Court further ordered that the petitioner shall deposit his passport back to the trial Court within 15 days of his return to India. Moreover, it is open for the petitioner to apply for permanent release of his passport, if necessity arises.
Accordingly, the petition is deposed of in the above mentioned terms.
