Seeking release of his passport, to enable the petitioner to travel
Canada to attend the convocation of his daughter, he had approached the trial
Court. However, this prayer was rejected by Judicial Magistrate Ist Class,
Jalandhar vide order dated 20.06.2022 (Annexure P-5). Aggrieved from the
aforesaid order, the petitioner has come up before this Court by filing the
present petition under Section 482 CrPC.
Learned counsel for the petitioner has referred to the petition
which points out towards such convocation and necessity of release of the
passport. He has also referred to page 26 of the petition which contains the
affidavit in the matter of Canadian visitor visa of the petitioner – Kanwalpreet
Singh and Satinderjeet Kaur.
State does not dispute the facts, as mentioned in the petition.
The day a child is born, the parents have a desire that he/she
attains highest possible education. In Indian society, especially when a girl attains
pinnacle of education, it brings joy not only to the parents but also makes the
entire country proud. Thus, if her parents attend that function/convocation, it is
likely to motivate the child for her further education. Simply because a case is
pending, would not mean that a person (petitioner) would not return back to
India or cannot be brought back to India.
Given above, the present petition is allowed and the impugned
order dated 20.06.2022 (Annexure P-5) passed by Judicial Magistrate Ist Class,
Jalandhar is set aside. Petitioner is permitted to go abroad (Canada) and the trial
Court is directed to return the passport to the petitioner. However, this order is
subject to following conditions:-
i)       That the petitioner shall procure a smart phone and inform its IMEI
number and other details to the SHO/I.O. of the Police station
mentioned before. The petitioner shall always keep the phone
location/GPS on the “ON” mode. Whenever the Investigating
officer asks to share the location, the petitioner shall immediately
do so. The petitioner shall neither clear the location history,
Whatsapp chats, calls nor format the phone without permission of
the concerned SHO/I.O. This condition shall continue till the
completion of the trial or closure of case, whatever is earlier.
ii)   The petitioner shall intimate his address, phone and whatsapp
number at Canada to the concerned SHO/I.O.
Within 15 days of his return to India, the petitioner shall deposit
his passport back to the trial Court. However, it is clarified that such deposit shall
not restrict the petitioner to apply again for permanent release of his passport, if
necessity arises.
