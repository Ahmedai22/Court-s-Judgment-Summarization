1.      This petition under Section 34 of the Arbitration and Conciliation
Act, 1996 [for short ‘the Act’] assails an arbitral Award dated 19 th June,
2020, which is a domestic award in an international commercial
arbitration, rendered by a Sole Arbitrator.
2.     In the arbitral proceedings, the respondent (original claimant) had
raised a claim against the petitioner for an amount of USD 2,64,491 along
with interest at the rate of 18% per annum from January, 2014 till
payment or realization. The respondent also claimed USD 1,00,000 for
loss of business, loss of reputation and loss of opportunity.
3.     The dispute between the parties had arisen under a contract dated 3
August, 2007 involving services to be provided by the respondent for
‘lodging, sighting and allied facilities in Thailand’, under which the
respondent was to take care of the petitioner’s customers, touring
Thailand. The arbitral tribunal after hearing the parties on their respective
contentions, has passed the following operative award:-
“(A) The Respondent is directed to make payment of USD
157931.8 to the Claimant against Claim No.1 along with interest at
the rate of 18% p.a. from 1st September, 2014 till the date of the
Eight Hundred and Seventy-One) to the Claimant towards actual
costs and Rs.1 Lakh towards exemplary costs along with interest at
the rate of 18% p.a. from the date of the Award till payment and/or
realization.”
4.     The factual antecedents in relation to the disputes can be noted.
The petitioner is a company incorporated under the laws of India, whereas
the respondent company was registered under the laws of Thailand in
5.         The case of the respondent/claimant was to the effect that the
respondent is engaged in the business of providing travel, tourism and
logistic services. The petitioner also is engaged in the same business and
was offering tourism packages in India for domestic and international
locations. It was the respondent’s case that between 2009-2013, the
petitioner had availed the respondent’s services in arrangement of lodging,
sighting and allied facilities in Thailand by requiring the respondent to
cater to the petitioner’s customers touring Thailand. The tours and travels
as offered by the respondent were broadly divided into four groups,
namely “summer/winter series”, “summer (series)”, “ad-hoc group VIP”
and “FIT”. These tours comprised of different fares and itineraries. Out of
these tours the bulk activity was under the category of summers to winter
6.        The respondent contended that the parties had a principal to
principal relationship and no third party intermediary was involved of any
part of the transaction. The business communication between the parties
was mostly by email and telephone. The respondent contended that for
the services offered by the respondent to the petitioner, the respondent
raised invoices from time to time, of which the petitioner was making ad-
hoc payments partly discharging the amounts due and payable on different
outstanding invoices. The respondent contended that there was a running
account between the parties and after adjustment of payments made by the
petitioner and received by the respondent, as per the invoices, for the
different category of tours between the period 2010-2013, a principal sum
of USD 264,491 was due and payable by the petitioner to the respondent.
7.       As the petitioner had failed to make payment of the said amounts,
which according to the respondent were admittedly due and payable to the
respondent under the contract, the respondent approached this Court by
filing Company Petition No. 1057 of 2015 against the petitioner seeking a
relief that the petitioner be wound up, as the petitioner was unable to pay
its debts. In such proceedings by an order dated 4 December, 2017 read
with order dated 6 November, 2017, by consent of the parties the disputes
were referred to arbitration by constituting an arbitral tribunal of a sole
arbitrator, to adjudicate the disputes and differences between the parties.
8.      Before the arbitral tribunal, a statement of claim was filed by the
respondent making a principal claim of USD 2,64,491. The respondent
also claimed interest at the rate of 18% per annum payable from the date,
the contractual relationship between the parties stood terminated vide
email dated 4 January, 2014 of the petitioner and a sum of USD 1,00,000
for loss of business, loss of reputation and loss of opportunity.
9.       In countering the respondent’s claim, the petitioners’ defence
before arbitral tribunal was primarily that the respondent’s claim was
barred by the law of limitation considering dates of invoices/bills, on the
basis of which claims were made by the respondent. The petitioner also
contended that there was no privity of contract between the respondent
and the petitioner as an agreement dated 3 August 2007 was executed
with one Red Apple Travel Pvt. Ltd. (for short “RATL”)and the
respondent was merely an associate of RATL. The petitioner contended
that the invoices raised by the respondent were paid only under the
instruction of RATL.
10.    The petitioner however did not dispute that the respondent from
time to time was raising invoices on the petitioner, in respect of each of the
tours, as also to the fact that the petitioner was regularly making payment
of the said invoices/bills, however, a defence was set up by the petitioner
that it did not directly deal with the respondent. The petitioner hence
contended that there were no amounts due and payable by the petitioner
to the respondent.
11.     Before the arbitral tribunal, the parties were given a complete
opportunity to submit their respective pleadings as also lead their
evidence. As seen from the statement of claim, the respondent
categorically contended that there was a running account between the
parties and that the petitioner was making ad-hoc payments qua the
various invoices. The respondent also referred to the statements reflecting
the credit period within which payments were to be made by the
petitioner to the respondent, against the outstanding invoices and it was
only after such adjustments, the respondent contended that the principal
amount of USD 2,64,491 was due and payable by the petitioner to the
respondent. The relevant extracts from the statement of claim being claim
1 of the respondent can be noted, which read thus:-
“5.1 In these proceedings, Claimant seeks payment of the principal
amount USD 2,64,491 being the aggregate due from invoices pending
under all four categories of tours/ viz. (a) summer / winter (series), (b)
ad hoc group, (c) VIP, (d) FIT, between the period 2010-2013. These
bills were sent by email from time to time, as and when they were
generated. Copy of the outstanding invoices is annexed herewith as
5.2     As has been stated hereinbefore, there was a running account
between the parties. The Respondent would make ad hoc part
payments in respect of various invoices. The Claimant has prepared a
statement duly reflecting the credit/part payment made by Respondent
against the outstanding invoices. It is after this adjustment that the
principal amount of USD 2,64,491 is found payable. Copy of the
Statement of Outstanding is annexed herewith as Annexure C/38.”
12.    As noted above, the respondent, however, denied the case of the
respondent inter alia contending that there was no running account
between the parties and the payments were made invoice-wise upon
receiving instructions from RATL.
13.    The arbitral tribunal framed eleven points for determination, as set
out in paragraph 24 of the award. The subject matter of deliberation in
the present proceeding is issue no.8 namely ‘whether the petitioner (org.
respondent) proved that the claim was barred by the law of limitation.’ To
have a bird’s-eye view of the arbitral issues, the points for determination as
framed by the arbitral tribunal can be noted which read thus:-

14.   The arbitral tribunal on examining the evidence on record recorded
a finding of fact that there was a running account between the parties
which was reflected in the petitioner’s e-mail dated 4 January 2014
(Exhibit CW1/16), e-mail dated 25 March 2014 (CW1/19) and email
dated 7 April 2014 (CW1/22). In such context, the relevant finding as
recorded by the arbitral tribunal appreciating evidence/materials on record
can be noted, which reads thus:-
“38. As rightly pointed out by the learned Counsel for the
Claimant, the Respondent itself recognized that there was a running
account between the parties which is reflected in the Respondent’s
email dated 4th January 2014 (Exhibit CW1/16) whereby while
discontinuing with the services of the Claimant, the Respondent
stated that “We are looking on the overall Outstanding of Series, FIT
and Adhoc and need the final Outstanding Statement for us to clear
the same after checking.” By its further email dated 25 th March 2014
(Exhibit CW1/19) the Respondent asked for ‘Need the break-up and
the contract copies on an urgent basis for us to start closing the
outstanding.” This was followed by an email dated 7 th April 2014
(Exhibit CW1/22) from the Respondent to the Claimant stating that
“..we need the final Outstanding statement as per your records.” In
its email dated 12th May 2014 (Exhibit CW1/24) the Respondent
stated that “We are in the process of checking the Outstanding
statement sent by youI.” and “ do send the break-up of the last tour
so that we can take a call on the final payments to be made.” In the
said email, the Respondent raised 6 points as stated therein. It is
pertinent to note that this email dealt with old invoices of 2010, 2011
and 2012. It was not the case of the Respondent that it was not liable
to make payments in respect of the old invoices on the ground that
the same were old.
39.      These emails show that there was a running account between
the parties. It is also clear that the Respondent was aware that there
was a running account between the parties. The denial of the
running accounts has appeared for the first time in the Respondent’s
Advocates’ reply dated 1st September 2014 (Exhibit CW1/31) to the
Claimant’s legal notice.”
15.   In making the above observations, the arbitral tribunal accepted the
case of the respondent that there was a running account between the
parties. Once the respondent’s case of a running account existing between
the parties was accepted by the tribunal, the assertion and/or the case of
the respondent that the respondent’s claim was barred by the law of
limitation as alleged by the petitioner, could not find acceptance by the
arbitral tribunal. The arbitral award from paragraphs 87 to paragraph 111
provides for a detailed reasoning for the arbitral tribunal coming to a
conclusion that the claims of the respondent were not barred by limitation.
16.    Further,    the   arbitral   tribunal     considering   the   admitted
correspondence between the parties on the record of the proceedings,
observed that the e-mails of the petitioner addressed to the respondent
were a clear acknowledgment of the petitioner’s liability to pay amounts to
the respondent. Each of such e-mails and the context of each of the mails
was discussed by the learned arbitrator as clearly seen from the
observations made in paragraph 96. The arbitral tribunal accordingly
observed that the petitioner had clearly admitted that there was a jural
relationship with the respondent. It was observed that from time to time,
invoices were raised by the respondent upon the petitioner, and several
such invoices from the year 2010 had not been cleared by the petitioner
either fully or partly. Notably, the arbitral tribunal has observed that there
was no denial of liability by the petitioner to make payments under the
invoices in any of the e-mails and more particularly, to make payment of
these invoices/bills raised by the respondent in the year 2010, 2011, 2012
or 2013 much less on the ground that the same were time barred. The
observations of the arbitral tribunal are to the effect that the petitioner had
continuously assured the respondent to make payment and sought to
justify/ explain the delay in non-payment, due to reasons like non-
availability of the signing authority or the bank being closed or the
accountant not being in office or the like.         Such are the categorical
observations of the arbitral tribunal.
17.    It was hence observed by the arbitral tribunal that the e-mails
certainly constituted an acknowledgment of liability by the petitioner to
pay the respondent the outstanding amounts. It was observed that even
assuming that there was no running account between the parties, and that
the period of limitation for each invoice, was to be reckoned from the date
such invoice became payable, however, in view of the acknowledgment of
payment by the petitioner in such e-mails, a fresh period of limitation was
required to be computed from the respective acknowledgments which
would also bring the respondent’s claim within the period of limitation.
18.    The arbitral tribunal has also referred to the settled position in law
in such context by referring to the decisions as cited by both the parties, to
come to a conclusion that the respondent had clearly proved its case as
pleaded in paragraph 4.4 to 4.16 of the statement of claim on evidence,
that the e-mails of the petitioner pertaining to all pending invoices at the
relevant time, had the acknowledgment of the claims as made by the
respondent and such acknowledgment had been made by the petitioner
with regularity. It was thus held by the arbtiral tribunal that the claims as
made by the respondent were well within the prescribed limitation as per
the provisions of Section 18 and Article 113 of the Limitation Act, and
more particularly considering that under such arrangement between the
parties, the last payment which was made by the petitioner to the
respondent was on 18 November 2013. It was hence observed that a fresh
period of limitation would be required to be computed from such date
which certainly demonstrated that the respondent’s claim was within the
prescribed limitation. Accordingly, on examining such mixed question of
law and fact, the arbitral tribunal held that the claim of the respondent
was within the prescribed limitation.
19.    The impugned award was rendered in favour of the respondent on
31 January 2020 by which the petitioner was ordered to pay USD
157,931.80 (approximately Indian Rupees 1,12,53,513.70 alongwith
interest at the rate of 18% p.a.) from 1 September 2014 until the date of
the award and interest as per Section 31(7)(b) of the Act from the date of
the Award until payment. Further the applicant was directed to pay
arbitration costs of Rs.24,17,871/- and exemplary costs of Rs.1,00,000/- to
the respondent alongwith interest at the rate of 18% p.a. from the date of
the Award until payment.
20.    On 19 June 2020, corrections/clarifications to the Award were
sought on an application as made by the respondent under Section 33(1)
of the Act.
21.    Further an Execution Application (COMEX(L) No.8094 of 2020)
was filed by the respondent alongwith Interim Application No.489 of
2021 seeking disclosure of assets by the petitioner. There was also a prayer
for an order and injunction to be passed against the petitioner’s assets.
The petitioner filed a reply to the said Interim Application stating that it is
a commercially solvent company and has a positive net worth and that the
award was yet to attain finality.
22.    By an order dated 14 February 2022 passed by a co-ordinate Bench
of this Court, considering the contentions as urged on behalf of the
petitioner, the petitioner was directed to furnish a bank guarantee of
Rs.2,91,84,139/- in favour of the Prothonotary and Sr.Master of this
Court, being the amount payable by the petitioner to the respondent
under the impugned award, as on 14 February 2022. By an application
dated 25 February 2022, the respondent sought modification of the said
order dated 14 February 2022. In compliance of the said orders, the
petitioner has furnished a bank guarantee with the Prothonotary and
Sr.Master of this Court for an amount of Rs.2,91,84,139/-. This Court by
an order dated 8 March 2022 disposed of the Interim Application in the
Execution Application in view of the bank guarantee being furnished by
the petitioner.
23.    At the outset, it is required to be noted that the scope of
interference in an arbitral award is limited on the grounds which are
available under Section 34(2) of the Act, more particularly when the
arbitral award is an international commercial award. In the present case the
ground of patent illegality is not available as the award under challenge is
an award in an international commercial arbitration. The proviso to sub-
section (2-A) of Section 34 of the Act further clarifies that an award shall
not be set aside merely on the ground of an erroneous application of the
law or by re-appreciation of evidence.
24.    In so far as the grounds of challenge to the impugned award as set
out in the petition are concerned, it is required to be noted that there are
lengthy and verbose grounds on the merits of the disputes and mostly
dealing with factual issues. If these grounds are considered for
adjudication, then certainly the Court would not be adjudicating those
proceedings on the parameters, as to what Section 34 of the Act would
postulate, in fact any such adjudication would take the colour of an appeal
under Section 96 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908. This would
certainly involve re-appreciation of evidence, the Court being required to
come to a different conclusion than what has been appreciated by the
arbitral tribunal. This is certainly not the scope of proceedings under
Section 34 of the Act. Being conscious of such restrictions, Ms. Ghone,
learned counsel for the petitioner has fairly stated that the petitioner
cannot cross the well defined parameters of interference in arbitral awards
as ordained by Section 34 of the Act. She has accordingly confined her
submissions to the illegality of the award on the grounds which, according
to her, can be urged under Section 34 of the Act.
25.     The following are the submissions of Ms. Ghone in assailing the
(i)    Drawing the Court’s attention to paragraphs 27, 36, 37 of the
impugned award, it is submitted that the arbitral award is of such
nature which would shock the conscience of the Court as there is no
document on record to show that there was a running account and
the arbitral tribunal has come to a perverse conclusion that there was
a running account between the parties.
(ii)   Consequently the impugned arbitral award is contrary to the
fundamental policy of Indian law and the notions of justice. The
arbitral tribunal ought to have considered that there were number of
invoices of different dates, which would set down a different period
of limitation. Considering each of the invoices, the respondent’s
claims were barred by limitation, as each invoice would be required
to be construed as an independent contract. There was no running
account in whatsoever form, as produced by the respondent and
hence observations made in paragraphs 36, 38 and 39 of the award
could not have been made.
(iii)  Even    if,  the   respondent’s   case,   of   the   petitioner
acknowledging the debt was to be considered by the arbitral
tribunal, the question would arise, as to under which set of the
invoices such debt was acknowledged, requiring the arbitral tribunal
to consider whether the claims were barred by the law of limitation.
(iv)   It is submitted that in a wholesale manner, the invoices
together could not have been considered by the arbitral tribunal to
hold that the total claim of the respondent based on these invoices
was a claim within limitation. Hence, the whole approach of the
arbitral tribunal is perverse calling for interference of the Court
within its jurisdiction under Section 34 of the Act.
26.    These are the only submissions as urged on behalf of the petitioner.
In support of the above submissions, reliance is placed on the decisions of
the Supreme Court in (i) Pundlik Jalam Patil (dead) by LRS Vs. Executive
Engineer, Jalgaon Medium Project and Another 1 and (ii) Basawaraj and
27.    On the other hand, Mr. Krishnan, learned counsel for the
respondent in opposing the petition has made the following submissions:-
(i)     No ground for interference has been made out by the
petitioner and more particularly considering the provisions of sub-
section (2-A) of Section 34 of the Act as no ground of patent
illegality on the face of the award could be demonstrated by the
petitioner.
(ii)    On a perusal of grounds as set out in the memo of the
petition, it has become clear that the grounds are mostly on the
merits of the disputes and none of these grounds fall within the
permissible parameters to assail an award under Section 34 of the
Act. The contentions of the petitioner in challenging the award are
mostly in the nature of inviting this Court to re-appreciate evidence,
and record fresh findings after re-appreciating evidence which is
certainly not the scope of jurisdiction under Section 34 of the Act.
(iii)  The arbitral tribunal has recorded findings of fact based on
materials and not a single ground as urged by the petitioner could
be labelled to be any observations/findings of the arbitral tribunal
which are not borne out by the record. It is submitted that there was
substantial material which was available and as discussed in the
arbitral award for the arbitral tribunal to hold that there was a
running account between the parties which was clear from the
admission of liability from the letters/e-mails of the petitioner
which formed part of the record. Based on such material, the
petitioner cannot contend that there was no material for the arbitral
tribunal to come to a conclusion that there was no running account
between the parties and/or the claims of the respondent were not
acknowledged. It is hence submitted that the claims as made by the
respondent were well within the prescribed limitation. It is
submitted that it is a settled principle of law that the arbitral
tribunal is the master of the quantity and quality of evidence in
adjudication of the arbitral disputes.
(iv)   From the submissions as urged on behalf of the petitioner as
also the grounds as raised in the petition, the contention of the
petitioner is of the impugned award being hit by patent illegality,
which is a ground, not available to the petitioner when the
challenge is to an award, which is in an international arbitration, as
sub-section (2-A) of Section 34 of the Act would provide.
28.      In support of the above submissions, reliance is placed on the
decisions of the Supreme Court in (a) Renusagar Power Co. Ltd. vs.
General Electric Co.3, (b) Associate Builders vs. Delhi Development
Authority4, (c) Ssangyong Engineering & Construction Co. Ltd. vs.
National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) 5, (d) Vijay Karia & Ors.
Company Ltd. vs. April Usa Assistance Inc. 7, (f) Delhi Airport Metro
Express Pvt. Ltd. vs. Delhi Metro Rail Corporation Ltd. 8 and (g) Aircon
Beibars FZE vs. Heligo Charters Pvt. Ltd.9
29.      Having heard learned counsel for the parties and having perused
the record and the impugned award, at the outset, it needs to be noted that
the arbitration in question is an international commercial arbitration as
domestically held under Part I of the Act. Considering such nature of the
award, the contention as urged on behalf of the respondent that sub-
section (2-A) of Section 34 of the Act, which provides that an arbitral
award which arises out of arbitrations which are international commercial
arbitrations, the ground that the award is vitiated by patent illegality,
appearing on the face of the award would not be applicable. Also such
arbitral award cannot be set aside merely on the ground of erroneous
application of law or re-appreciation of evidence. For convenience, it
would be appropriate to extract Section 34 of the Act to appreciate the
scope of interference by the Court in an arbitral award. Section 34 reads
“34. Application for setting aside arbitral award. —
(1)    Recourse to a Court against an arbitral award may be made
only by an application for setting aside such award in accordance with
sub-section (2) and sub-section (3).
(2)    An arbitral award may be set aside by the Court only if—
(a)    the party making the application furnishes proof that—
(i)     a party was under some incapacity, or
(ii)    the arbitration agreement is not valid under the law to
which the parties have subjected it or, failing any indication
thereon, under the law for the time being in force; or
(iii) the party making the application was not given proper
notice of the appointment of an arbitrator or of the arbitral
proceedings or was otherwise unable to present his case; or
(iv)    the arbitral award deals with a dispute not
contemplated by or not falling within the terms of the
submission to arbitration, or it contains decisions on matters
beyond the scope of the submission to arbitration:
Provided that, if the decisions on matters submitted to
arbitration can be separated from those not so submitted, only
that part of the arbitral award which contains decisions on
matters not submitted to arbitration may be set aside; or
(v)     the composition of the arbitral tribunal or the arbitral
procedure was not in accordance with the agreement of the
parties, unless such agreement was in conflict with a provision
of this Part from which the parties cannot derogate, or, failing
such agreement, was not in accordance with this Part; or
(b)        the Court finds that—
(i)     the subject-matter of the dispute is not capable of
settlement by arbitration under the law for the time being in
(ii)    the arbitral award is in conflict with the public policy
of India.
[Explanation 1.--For the avoidance of any doubt, it is clarified that an
award is in conflict with the public policy of India, only if,--
(i) the making of the award was induced or affected by fraud or
corruption or was in violation of section 75 or section 81; or
(ii) it is in contravention with the fundamental policy of Indian law;
(iii) it is in conflict with the most basic notions of morality or justice.
Explanation 2.--For the avoidance of doubt, the test as to whether
there is a contravention with the fundamental policy of Indian law
shall not entail a review on the merits of the dispute.]
(2-A) An arbitral award arising out of arbitrations other than
international commercial arbitrations, may also be set aside by the
Court, if the Court finds that the award is vitiated by patent illegality
appearing on the face of the award:
Provided that an award shall not be set aside merely on the
ground of an erroneous application of the law or by reappreciation of
evidence.
(3)        An application for setting aside may not be made after three
months have elapsed from the date on which the party making that
application had received the arbitral award or, if a request had been
made under section 33, from the date on which that request had been
disposed of by the arbitral tribunal: Provided that if the Court is
satisfied that the applicant was prevented by sufficient cause from
making the application within the said period of three months it may
entertain the application within a further period of thirty days, but
not thereafter.
(4)        On receipt of an application under sub-section (1), the Court
may, where it is appropriate and it is so requested by a party, adjourn
the proceedings for a period of time determined by it in order to give
the arbitral tribunal an opportunity to resume the arbitral
proceedings or to take such other action as in the opinion of arbitral
tribunal will eliminate the grounds for setting aside the arbitral
award.”
30. As the arguments and the deliberation on the proceedings was
focused on the observations as made by the arbitral tribunal in paragraphs
29, 36, 38, 39, 87, 88 and 89 of the impugned award, it would be
convenient to note these observations, which read thus:-
“29. It is the case of the Claimant that there was a running account
between the parties and that the Respondent made ad-hoc part payments in
respect of various invoices. The Claimant has prepared a statement
reflecting the credit/part payment made by the Respondent against the
outstanding invoices and states that after this adjustment the principal
amount of USD 264,491 is payable by the Respondent.
36.      Mr. Krishnan, learned Counsel for the Claimant relies upon the
judgment of the Delhi High Court in Bharath Skins Corporation vs. Taneja
Skins Company Pvt. Ltd., 2011 SCC Online Del 5523 to submit that the
provision of services by the Claimant to the Respondent from 2009 to 2013
is a single contractual relationship and that the account between the parties
was an open running and non-mutual account. He relied upon paragraphs
2 to 8 and 13 to 25 of the said judgment. In paragraph 14, the Delhi High
Court has held that “Where ‘A’ sells goods to ‘B’ from time to time and ‘B’
makes payments towards the price from time to time, there is only a ‘single’
contractual relationship, namely, that of buyer and seller, between the
parties. ‘A’ has demands against ‘B’ for items sold, but ‘B’ can have no
demands against ‘A’.” In paragraph 20, it has been held that “In case of a
running and non-mutual account between the buyer and seller, when goods
are delivered by the seller to the buyer, the value of the goods is debited in
the debit column and when amounts are paid by the buyer to the seller,
they are entered in the credit column. The difference is continuously struck
in the column for balance. In such a case, when the buyer defaults to make
balance payment, the seller's action is not for the price of goods sold and
delivered but for the balance due at the foot of an account. Thus, Article 14
would have no application in suits for recovery of money due on a running
and a non-mutual current account between the buyer and seller.’
38.      As rightly pointed out by the learned Counsel for the Claimant, the
Respondent itself recognized that there was a running account between the
parties which is reflected in the Respondent’s email dated 4 th January 2014
(Exhibit CW1/16) whereby while discontinuing with the services of the
Claimant, the Respondent stated that “We are looking on the overall
Outstanding of Series, FIT and Adhoc and need the final Outstanding
Statement for us to clear the same after checking.” By its further email dated
25" March 2014 (Exhibit CW1/19) the Respondent asked for “Need the
break-up and the contract copies on an urgent basis for us to start closing
the outstanding.” This was followed by an email dated 7 th April 2014
(Exhibit CW1/22) from the Respondent to the Claimant stating that “...we
need the final Outstanding statement as per your records.” In its email
dated 12" May 2014 (Exhibit CW1/24) the Respondent stated that “We are
in the process of checking the Outstanding statement sent by you.” and “Do
send the break-up of the last tour so that we can take a call on the final
payments to be made.” In the said email, the Respondent raised 6 points as
stated therein. It is pertinent to note that this email dealt with old invoices
of 2010, 2011 and 2012. It was not the case of the Respondent that it was
not liable to make payments in respect of the old invoices on the ground
that the same were old.
39.      These emails show that there was a running account between the
parties. It is also clear that the Respondent was aware that there was a
running account between the parties. The denial of the running account has
appeared for the first time in the Respondent’s Advocates’ reply dated 1 st
September 2014 (Exhibit CW1/31) to the Claimant’ legal notice.
87.      Point for Determination no. (viii)
“Whether the Respondent proves that the claim is barred by the
88.      Ms. Ghone, learned Counsel for the Respondent submits that as
the payments were made invoice-wise, a claim would have to be made as
and when there is a default invoice wise in making the payment. I have
already held that it is proved that there was a running account between the
parties and that the payments having being made invoice-wise does not
negate the existence of a running account between the parties. In view
thereof, I reject the contention that claims ought to have been made as and
when there was a default in making payment towards a certain invoice. It
must be borne in mind that it was a long standing and continuing business
relationship between parties over a span of 4 years and extending to
hundreds of tours and several thousand dollars during which part payments
were made from time to time towards the same invoices. The contractual
relationship came to an end only on 4 th January 2014 and therefore, the
period of limitation to file a suit or an arbitral reference cannot be said to
begin before 4th January, 2014. The reliance upon the judgment of the
Hon’ble Delhi High Court in Additional Commissioner of Income-tax vs.
Roshan 1982 SCC Online Del 54 by the learned counsel for the claimant to
state that the fact that the respondent made payment invoice-wise may be
relevant but is not determinative of the non-existence of a running account
is apposite. Learned counsel for the claimant relied upon the judgment of
the Hon’ble Delhi High Court in M/s. Naraingarh Sugar Mills Ltd. vs.
Krishna Malhotra, 2012 SCC Online Del 1492 in which case payment had
been made invoice-wise and yet it was held that it was a running account.
89.      Mr. Krishnan, learned Counsel for the Claimant submitted that a
running account is not confined to Article 1 of the Limitation Act, 1908.
He submitted that if an account is not registered and not mutual then
Article 113 of the Limitation Act, 1908 would apply, which provides for a
period of limitation for 3 years from when the right to sue accrues. He relies
upon the judgment of the Hon’ble Delhi High Court in Bharath Skins
Corporation (supra), followed by the Hon’ble Madras High Court in
Renganathan (supra) and Division Bench of the Hon’ble Delhi High Court
in Advert Communications Pvt. Ltd. v. JSL Media Ltd. dated 16 th
September, 2016 in RFA (OS) No. 48/2016. On the other hand, Ms.
Ghone, learned counsel for the respondent submits that Article 14 of the
Schedule to the Limitation Act, 1963 would be the correct article applicable
to the present case. She relies upon the judgment of the Hon’ble Bombay
High Court in Vijaykumar Satishchandra & Co. vs. Rajgopal Badrinarayan
Malpani, reported in 1996 Mh. L.J. 594.”
31.    It is thus seen that the arbitral tribunal has discussed in extenso the
materials on the basis of which such findings have been recorded. In the
light of such findings as recorded on appreciation of the evidence on
record, it is difficult to accept the case as urged on behalf of the petitioner
that the findings as recorded by the arbitral tribunal are of a nature which
would shock the judicial conscience.
32.    There is also much substance in the contentions as urged on behalf
of the respondent and more particularly considering the elaborate findings
as recorded by the arbitral tribunal that the arbitral tribunal is the master
of the quantity and quality of evidence and it would not be the jurisdiction
of the Court under Section 34 of the Act to re-appreciate evidence and
interfere with the findings of the arbitral tribunal. On such context the
following discussion would throw further light.
33.    The petitioner’s basic case is that the claims as made by the
respondent were barred by limitation. In so far as the issue of limitation is
concerned, the arbitral tribunal appreciating the evidence on record and
more particularly, the correspondence between the parties namely the
admitted e-mails has recorded a clear finding that there was a running
account between the parties. The arbitral tribunal has observed that the
amounts as payable by the petitioner to the respondent were
acknowledged, as seen from the e-mails as addressed by the petitioner to
the respondent, hence, the amounts were due and payable by the
petitioner to the respondent under the invoices, being not disputed, is a
finding of fact, as recorded by the arbitral tribunal. The obvious
consequence of such evidence of admission of liability was that the
petitioner was under an obligation to make payment of the amounts
under the unpaid invoices.       At no point of time, the invoices were
disputed and/or liability under the same was denied in a manner known to
law. These are the findings of fact as recorded by the arbitral tribunal.
34.    Thus, it cannot be said that there was any perversity in the arbitral
tribunal coming to a conclusion in regard to acknowledgment of liability
by the petitioner and that there was a running account between the
parties. The case of the petitioner being set up contrary to the materials on
record cannot be accepted. Such contentions as urged on behalf of the
petitioner at the most are in fact contentions on patent illegality of the
arbitral award, which is not available to the petitioner to be urged in the
present proceedings, when the arbitration in question is an international
commercial arbitration. The position in law in such context is required to
be considered.
35.    Prior to 1996, before the present Act was brought into the force,
foreign awards could be enforced as per the provisions of the Foreign
Awards (Recognition and Enforcement) Act 1961 (for short “”Foreign
Awards Act”), the question in regard to the enforcement of a foreign
awards under the Foreign Awards Act had fell for consideration of the
Supreme Court in the case of Renusagar Power Co. Ltd. (supra). The
Supreme Court held that the scope of enquiry before the Court in which a
foreign award was sought to be enforced, was limited to grounds which
were mentioned in Section 7 of the Foreign Awards Act. It was observed
that such provision did not enable a party to the said proceedings to
impeach the award on merits.      As Section 7(1)(b)(ii) of the Foreign
Awards Act used the word “public policy”, it was held that such words
would be required to be given a meaning to be the public policy of India.
The Court observed that it cannot be held that by not using the words
"public policy of India" and only using the words "public policy" in
Section 7(1)(b)(ii) of the Foreign Awards Act, Parliament intended to
deviate from the provisions of the New York Convention contained in
Article V(2)(b) which uses the words "public policy of that country"
implying the public policy of the country where recognition and
enforcement was sought. It was held that it was borne out by the
amendment introduced to the Act, by Amendment Act 47 of 1973, which
was after the decision of the Supreme Court in V/O Tractoroexport,
Moscow vs. Tarapore & Co. case (AIR1971 SC 1), whereby Section 3 was
substituted to bring the same in accord with the provisions of the New
York Convention. It was observed that the Foreign Awards Act was
enacted to give effect to the New York Convention which seeks to remedy
the defects in the Geneva Convention of 1927 that hampered the speedy
settlement of disputes through arbitration.       It was observed that the
Foreign Awards Act is, hence was intended to reduce the time taken in
recognition and enforcement of foreign arbitral awards. It was observed
that the New York Convention seeks to achieve the said objective by
dispensing with the requirement of the leave to enforce the award by the
courts where the award is made and thereby avoid the problem of "double
exequatur”. It was observed that the Act also restricted the scope of
enquiry before the Court enforcing the award, by eliminating the
requirement that the award should not be contrary to the principles of the
law of the country in which it is sought to be relied upon. It was observed
that enlarging the field of enquiry to include public policy of the Courts
whose law governs the contract or of the country of the place of
arbitration, would run counter to the express intent of the legislation. It
was further observed that in view of the absence of a workable definition
of "international public policy" the expression "public policy" as used in
Article V(2)(b) of the New York Convention cannot be construed to be an
international public policy. It was observed that the such expression must
be construed to mean the doctrine of public policy as applied by the courts
in which the foreign award is sought to be enforced. The Supreme Court
held that the expression 'public policy' in Section 7(1)(b)(ii) of the Foreign
Awards Act means the doctrine of public policy as applied by the courts in
India. It was also observed that a distinction is required to be drawn while
applying the rule of public policy between a matter governed by domestic
law and a matter involving conflict of laws, while observing that the
application of the doctrine of public policy in the field of conflict of laws is
more limited than that in the domestic law and that the courts are slower
to invoke public policy in cases involving a foreign element than when a
purely municipal legal issue is involved. It was also held that transactions
containing a foreign element may constitute a less serious threat to
municipal institutions than purely local transactions. In this context, it
was held that the defence of public policy which is permissible under
Section 7(1)(b)(ii) should be construed narrowly. The Supreme Court
concluded that applying the said principles, it must be held that the
enforcement of a foreign award could be refused only on the ground that it
is contrary to public policy if such enforcement is contrary to (i)
fundamental policy of Indian law; or (ii) the interests of India; or (iii)
justice or morality. The observations of the Supreme Court in paragraphs
65 and 66 are required to be noted which read thus:-
“65.    This would imply that the defence of public policy which is
permissible under Section 7(1)(b)(ii) should be construed narrowly.
In this context, it would also be of relevance to mention that under
Article I(e) of the Geneva Convention Act of 1927, it is permissible
to raise objection to the enforcement of arbitral award on the ground
that the recognition or enforcement of the award is contrary to the
public policy or to the principles of the law of the country in which it
is sought to be relied upon. To the same effect is the provision in
Section 7(1) of the Protocol & Convention Act of 1837 which
requires that the enforcement of the foreign award must not be
contrary to the public policy or the law of India. Since the expression
"public policy" covers the field not covered by the words "and the law
of India" which follow the said expression, contravention of law alone
will not attract the bar of public policy and something more than
contravention of law is required.
66.      Article V(2)(b) of the New York Convention of 1958 and
Section 7(1)(b)(ii) of the Foreign Awards Act do not postulate refusal
of recognition and enforcement of a foreign award on the ground that
it is contrary to the law of the country of enforcement and the
ground of challenge is confined to the recognition and enforcement
being contrary to the public policy of the country in which the award
is set to be enforced. There is nothing to indicate that the expression
"public policy" in Article V(2)(b) of the New York Convention and
Section 7(1)(b)(ii) of the Foreign Awards Act is not used in the same
sense in which it was used in Article 1(c) of the Geneva Convention
of 1927 and Section 7(1) of the Protocol and Convention Act of
1937. This would mean that "public policy" in Section 7(1)(b)(ii) has
been used in a narrower sense and in order to attract to bar of public
policy the enforcement of the award must invoke something more
than the violation of the law of India. Since the Foreign Awards Act is
concerned with recognition and enforcement of foreign awards which
are governed by the principles of private international law, the
expression "public policy" in Section 7(1)(b)(ii) of the Foreign
Awards Act must necessarily be construed in the sense the doctrine of
public policy is applied in the field of private international law.
Applying the said criteria it must be held that the enforcement of a
foreign award would be refused on the ground that it is contrary to
public policy if such enforcement would be contrary to (i)
fundamental policy of Indian law; or (ii) the interests of India; or (iii)
justice or morality.”
36.   The decision of the Supreme Court in Renusagar Power Co. Ltd. vs.
General Electric Co. (supra) was applied with approval by the Supreme
Court in its decision in Associate Builders vs. Delhi Development
Authority (supra) when the Court reiterated the principles of interference
in an arbitral award under Section 34 of the Act and in the context of
fundamental policy of Indian law. Learned counsel for the respondent
would be right in his contention relying on the decision of Associate
Builders vs. Delhi Development Authority (supra) when he submits that
the contention as urged on behalf of the petitioner on limitation cannot be
argued as an issue under Section 34(2)(b)(ii) of the Act namely the arbitral
award being in conflict with most basic notions of morality and justice.
The Supreme Court in Associate Builders vs. Delhi Development
Authority (supra) has clearly observed that when a court is applying the
"public policy" test to an arbitration award, it does not act as a court of
appeal and consequently errors of fact cannot be corrected.             It was
observed that a possible view by the arbitrator on facts has necessarily to
pass muster as the arbitrator is the ultimate master of the quantity and
quality of evidence to be relied upon when he delivers his arbitral award.
The Supreme Court has observed that one of the grounds of public policy
is, when an award is against justice or morality. It was observed that these
are two different concepts in law. The Supreme Court observed that an
award can be said to be against justice only when it shocks the conscience
of the Court when it succinctly set out an illustration as to when it would
be something which would shock the conscience of the Court. The
illustration being, when the claimant is restricting his claim to Rs. 30 lakhs
in a statement of claim before the arbitral tribunal and at no point of time
does he seek to claim anything more, however, the arbitral award when
awards him Rs.45 lakhs without any acceptable reason or justification, this
obviously, would be something which would shock the conscience of the
Court, and for such reason the arbitral award would be liable to be set
aside on the ground that it is contrary to justice.                      Applying such
parameters, I would be at a loss to understand as to how the petitioner can
fit its case within the permissible parameters of interference under Section
34(2)(b)(iii) of the Act to label the award as against the basic notions of
morality or justice.
37.      In Ssangyong Engineering & Construction Co. Ltd. vs. National
Highways Authority of India (NHAI) (supra), again the concept of public
policy was explained by the Supreme Court to hold that the expression
“public policy of India”, whether contained in Section 34 or in Section 48
of the Act, would mean the “fundamental policy of Indian law” as
explained in paragraphs 18 and 27 of Associate Builders vs. Delhi
Development Authority (supra) which read thus:-
“18. In Renusagar Power Co. Ltd. v. General Electronic Co., 1994
Supp (1) SCC 644, the Supreme Court construed Section 7 (1)(b) (ii)
of the Foreign Awards (Recognition and Enforcement) Act, 1961:
"7. Conditions for enforcement of foreign awards.-(1) A foreign
award may not be enforced under this Act-
(b)    if the Court dealing with the case is satisfied that-
(ii) the enforcement of the award will be contrary
In construing the expression "public policy" in the context of a
foreign award, the Court held that an award contrary to
(i)    The fundamental policy of Indian law,
would be set aside on the ground that it would be contrary to the
public policy of India. It went on further to hold that a contravention
of the provisions of the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act would be
contrary to the public policy of India in that the statute is enacted for
the national economic interest to ensure that the nation does not lose
foreign exchange which is essential for the economic survival of the
nation (see para 75). Equally, disregarding orders passed by the
superior courts in India could also be a contravention of the
fundamental policy of Indian law, but the recovery of compound
interest on interest, being contrary to statute only, would not
contravene any fundamental policy of Indian law.
27.      Coming to each of the heads contained in the Saw Pipes
judgment, we will first deal with the head "fundamental policy of
Indian Law". It has already been seen from the Renusagar judgment
that violation of the Foreign Exchange Act and disregarding orders of
superior courts in India would be regarded as being contrary to the
fundamental policy of Indian law. To this it could be added that the
binding effect of the judgment of a superior court being disregarded
would be equally violative of the fundamental policy of Indian law.”
38.    The Supreme Court in Ssangyong Engineering & Construction Co.
Ltd.(supra) also observed that the fundamental policy of Indian law would
be relegated to the “Renusagar” understanding of this expression. The
observations of the Supreme Court in that regard are required to be noted
“34. What is clear, therefore, is that the expression “public policy
of India”, whether contained in Section 34 or in Section 48, would
now mean the “fundamental policy of Indian law” as explained in
paragraphs 18 and 27 of Associate Builders (supra), i.e., the
fundamental policy of Indian law would be relegated to the
“Renusagar” understanding of this expression.               This would
necessarily mean that Western Geco (supra) expansion has been done
away with. In short, Western Geco (supra), as explained in
paragraphs 28 and 29 of Associate Builders (supra), would no longer
obtain, as under the guise of interfering with an award on the ground
that the arbitrator has not adopted a judicial approach, the Court’s
intervention would be on the merits of the award, which cannot be
permitted post amendment. However, insofar as principles of natural
justice are concerned, as contained in Sections 18 and 34(2)(a)(iii) of
the 1996 Act, these continue to be grounds of challenge of an award,
as is contained in paragraph 30 of the Associate Builders (supra).
35.      It is important to notice that the ground for interference
insofar as it concerns “interest of India” has since been deleted, and
therefore, no longer obtains. Equally, the ground for interference on
the basis that the award is in conflict with justice or morality is now
to be understood as a conflict with the “most basic notions of
morality or justice”. This again would be in line with paragraphs 36
to 39 of Associate Builders, as it is only such arbitral awards that
shock the conscience of the court that can be set aside on this ground.
36.      Thus, it is clear that public policy of India is now constricted
to mean firstly, that a domestic award is contrary to the fundamental
policy of Indian law, as understood in paragraphs 18 and 27 of
Associate Builders, or secondly, that such award is against basic
notions of justice or morality as understood in paragraphs 36 to 39 of
Associate Builders. Explanation 2 to Section 34(2)(b)(ii) and
Explanation 2 to Section 48(2)(b)(ii) was added by the Amendment
Act only so that Western Geco (supra), as understood in Associate
Builders, and paragraphs 28 and 29 in particular, is now done away
37.      Insofar as domestic awards made in India are concerned, an
additional ground is now available under sub-section (2-A), added by
the Amendment Act, 2015, to Section 34. Here, there must be patent
illegality appearing on the face of the award, which refers to such
illegality as goes to the root of the matter but which does not amount
to mere erroneous application of the law. In short, what is not
subsumed within “the fundamental policy of Indian law”, namely, the
contravention of a statute not linked to public policy or public
interest, cannot be brought in by the backdoor when it comes to
setting aside an award on the ground of patent illegality.
38.      Secondly, it is also made clear that re-appreciation of
evidence, which is what an appellate court is permitted to do, cannot
be permitted under the ground of patent illegality appearing on the
face of the award.
39.      To elucidate, paragraph 42.1 of Associate Builders, namely, a
mere contravention of the substantive law of India, by itself, is no
longer a ground available to set aside an arbitral award. Paragraph
42.2 of Associate Builders (supra), however, would remain, for if an
arbitrator gives no reasons for an award and contravenes Section
31(3) of the 1996 Act, that would certainly amount to a patent
illegality on the face of the award.
44.      In Renusagar (supra), this Court dealt with a challenge to a
foreign award under Section 7 of the Foreign Awards (Recognition
and Enforcement) Act, 1961 [“Foreign Awards Act”]. The Foreign
Awards Act has since been repealed by the 1996 Act. However,
considering that Section 7 of the Foreign Awards Act contained
grounds which were borrowed from Article V of the Convention on
the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards, 1958
[“New York Convention”], which is almost in the same terms as
Sections 34 and 48 of the 1996 Act, the said judgment is of great
importance in understanding the parameters of judicial review when
it comes to either foreign awards or international commercial
arbitrations being held in India, the grounds for challenge/refusal of
enforcement under Sections 34 and 48, respectively, being the same.”
39.    In the context of the above observations and the nature of the
challenge as urged on behalf of the petitioner, the observations of the
Supreme Court in paragraph 76 in Ssangyong Engineering &
Construction Co. Ltd. vs. National Highways Authority of India (NHAI)
(supra) as relied on behalf of the petitioner are certainly not applicable.
For convenience, paragraphs 75 and 76 of the said case are required to be
“75. Insofar as the argument that a new contract had been made by
the majority award for the parties, without the consent of the
appellant, by applying a formula outside the agreement, as per the
Circular dated 15.02.2013, which itself could not be applied without
the appellant’s consent, we are of the view that this ground under
Section 34(2)(a)(iv) would not be available, given the authorities
discussed in detail by us. It is enough to state that the appellant
argued before the arbitral tribunal that a new contract was being
made by applying the formula outside what was prescribed, which
was answered by the respondent, stating that it would not be possible
to apply the old formula without a linking factor which would have
to be introduced. Considering that the parties were at issue on this,
the dispute as to whether the linking factor applied, thanks to the
Circular dated 15.02.2013, is clearly something raised and argued by
the parties, and is certainly something which would fall within the
arbitration clause or the reference to arbitration that governs the
parties. This being the case, this argument would not obtain and
Section 34(2)(a)(iv), as a result, would not be attracted.
76.     However, when it comes to the public policy of India
argument based upon “most basic notions of justice”, it is clear that
this ground can be attracted only in very exceptional circumstances
when the conscience of the Court is shocked by infraction of
fundamental notions or principles of justice. It can be seen that the
formula that was applied by the agreement continued to be applied
till February, 2013 – in short, it is not correct to say that the formula
under the agreement could not be applied in view of the Ministry’s
change in the base indices from 1993-94 to 2004-05. Further, in
order to apply a linking factor, a Circular, unilaterally issued by one
party, cannot possibly bind the other party to the agreement without
that other party’s consent. Indeed, the Circular itself expressly
stipulates that it cannot apply unless the contractors furnish an
undertaking/affidavit that the price adjustment under the Circular is
acceptable to them. We have seen how the appellant gave such
undertaking only conditionally and without prejudice to its argument
that the Circular does not and cannot apply. This being the case, it is
clear that the majority award has created a new contract for the
parties by applying the said unilateral Circular and by substituting a
workable formula under the agreement by another formula de hors
the agreement. This being the case, a fundamental principle of justice
has been breached, namely, that a unilateral addition or alteration of a
contract can never be foisted upon an unwilling party, nor can a party
to the agreement be liable to perform a bargain not entered into with
the other party. Clearly, such a course of conduct would be contrary
to fundamental principles of justice as followed in this country, and
shocks the conscience of this Court. However, we repeat that this
ground is available only in very exceptional circumstances, such as
the fact situation in the present case. Under no circumstance can any
Court interfere with an arbitral award on the ground that justice has
not been done in the opinion of the Court. That would be an entry
into the merits of the dispute which, as we have seen, is contrary to
the ethos of Section 34 of the 1996 Act, as has been noted earlier in
this judgment.”
40.    In Vijay Karia & Ors. vs. Prysmian Cavi E Sistemi SRL & Ors.
(supra), the Supreme Court taking a review of the law on enforceability of
a foreign arbitral award, observed that it is only when a foreign award fails
to determine a material issue which goes to the root of the matter or fails
to decide a claim or counter-claim in its entirety, the award may shock the
conscience of the Court and may not be enforced as on such
considerations the award would then offend the most basic notion of
justice in this country. It was observed to be always remembered that poor
reasoning, by which a material issue or a claim is rejected, can never fall in
this class of cases. It was also emphasized that the foreign award must be
read as a whole, fairly, and without nit-picking. In paragraphs 83 and 88,
the Court observed thus:-
“83. Having said this, however, if a foreign award fails to
determine a material issue which goes to the root of the matter or
fails to decide a claim or counter-claim in its entirety, the award may
shock the conscience of the Court and may not be enforced, as was
done by the Delhi High Court in Campos on the ground of violation
of the public policy of India, in that it would then offend a most basic
notion of justice in this country. It must always be remembered that
poor reasoning, by which a material issue or claim is rejected, can
never fall in this class of cases. Also, issues that the tribunal
considered essential and has addressed must be given their due
weight – it often happens that the tribunal considers a particular issue
as essential and answers it, which by implication would mean that the
other issue or issues raised have been implicitly rejected. For example,
two parties may both allege that the other is in breach. A finding that
one party is in breach, without expressly stating that the other party is
not in breach, would amount to a decision on both a claim and a
counter-claim, as to which party is in breach. Similarly, after hearing
the parties, a certain sum may be awarded as damages and an issue as
to interest may not be answered at all. This again may, on the facts of
a given case, amount to an implied rejection of the claim for interest.
The important point to be considered is that the foreign award must
be read as a whole, fairly, and without nit-picking. If read as a whole,
the said award has addressed the basic issues raised by the parties and
has, in substance, decided the claims and counter-claims of the
parties, enforcement must follow.
88.      … … The fundamental policy of Indian law, as has been held
in Renusagar (supra), must amount to a breach of some legal
principle or legislation which is so basic to Indian law that it is not
susceptible of being compromised. “Fundamental Policy” refers to
the core values of India’s public policy as a nation, which may find
expression not only in statutes but also time-honoured, hallowed
principles which are followed by the Courts. Judged from this point
of view, it is clear that resistance to the enforcement of a foreign
award cannot be made on this ground.”
41.     In Oriental Insurance Company Ltd. vs. April Usa Assistance Inc.
(supra), the challenge before the learned Single Judge of Delhi High Court
in a petition filed under Section 34 of the Act was to an arbitral award.
The principal grounds on which the impugned award was assailed was that
it allowed the claims which were barred by limitation. In such context, the
Court observed that Explanation 2 of Section 34 (2) of the Act clarifies
that the question whether there is any contravention of the fundamental
policy of Indian law does not entail a review on the merits of the dispute.
It was observed that even if it is assumed that the statute of limitation is a
part of the fundamental policy of Indian law, the question whether a claim
is barred by limitation is a mixed question of fact and law.
42.     In Aircon Beibars FZE vs. Heligo Charters Pvt. Ltd. (supra), this
Court was considering an issue in regard to enforcement of a foreign award
within the meaning of Section 44 Part II of the Act. In opposing the
enforcement of the award, an issue was raised before the Court that a
finding as recorded by the arbitral tribunal was based on no evidence and
being not based on evidence, therefore the same was perverse. The Court
in such context observed that jurisdictional errors would include situations
when an arbitrator wanders outside the contract and deals with matters
which were not referred to him and this may be considered to be a patent
illegality but this would not be applicable to international commercial
arbitrations. The Court observed that the public policy exception must be
narrowly viewed and only an award which shocks the conscience of the
Court would be set aside. Such observations were made referring to the
decisions of the Supreme Court in Renusagar Power Co. Ltd. vs. General
Electric Co. (supra), Associate Builders vs. Delhi Development Authority
(supra), Ssangyong Engineering & Construction Co. Ltd. vs. National
Highways Authority of India (NHAI) (supra) and Vijay Karia & Ors. vs.
43.     Now coming to the decisions as relied on behalf of the petitioner,
firstly Ms. Ghone relies on the decision of the Supreme Court in Pundlik
Jalam Patil (dead) by LRS Vs. Executive Engineer, Jalgaon Medium
Project and Another (supra). In my opinion, this decision would not assist
the petitioner for more than one reason, firstly, the principles as discussed
in paragraphs 25 and 26 of the said decision, are not in the context of any
challenge to an arbitral award under Section 34 of the Act.                The
controversy before the Supreme Court arose in challenge to a judgment
and order of the High Court allowing the applications filed by the
respondent/Executive Engineer under Section 5 of the Limitation Act,
1963 whereby a prayer was made to condone the delay of 1724 days in
filing appeals against the award passed by the Civil Judge, Senior Division,
Jalgaon in a land acquisition case.       The High Court accepted the
explanation offered by the respondent-Executive Engineer for the
apparent inordinate delay in filing the appeals against the award of the
Reference Court. The Supreme Court, however, did not find favour in the
orders of the High Court condoning delay, when it observed that the
Limitation Act did not provide for a different period to the government in
filing appeals or applications. It was observed that no case was pleaded
and/or proved by the respondent therein to make out a sufficient cause for
condonation of such delay. It was observed that the High Court had
gravely erred in exercising its discretion to condone the inordinate delay of
1724 days and accordingly set aside the orders passed by the High Court.
It is in such context, the Court had observed that the law of limitation is
founded on public policy. Such observations of the Supreme Court would
not assist the petitioner in the present context and more so considering
Section 34(2-A) of the Act.
44.     In Basawaraj and Another Vs. Special Land Acquisition Officer, the
Supreme Court was considering a challenge to the orders passed by the
High Court on appeals filed by the appellants therein, under Section 54 of
the Land Acquisition Act, 1894. Such appeals filed before the High Court
were time barred as the same were preferred after a delay of five and half
years and no satisfactory explanation was furnished in the application for
condonation of delay, for not approaching the Court within the prescribed
limitation.The High Court had rejected the delay condonation application
as no sufficient cause to condone such delay was made out. In such
context, the Court observed that law of limitation may harshly affect a
particular party but it has to be applied with all its rigour when the statute
so prescribes. It is in such context, it was observed by the Supreme Court
that the law of limitation was founded on public policy, as its aim was to
secure peace in the community, to suppress fraud and perjury, to quicken
diligence and to prevent oppression. It was also observed that it seeks to
bury all acts of the past which have not been agitated unexplainably and
have from lapse of time become stale. It is in such context referring to the
decision of P. Ramachandra Rao v. State of Karnataka, AIR 2002 SC 1856,
the Court held that judicially engrafting principles of limitation, amounted
to legislating and would fly in the face of law as laid down by the
Constitution Bench in the case of A. R. Antulay v. R.S. Nayak, AIR 1992
SC 1701.     Even this decision would not assist the petitioner as the
observations are also not in the context as to what the parameters of
Section 34 of the Act would provide on the touchstone of what has been
as laid down by the Supreme Court in the decisions of Renusagar Power
Co. Ltd. vs. General Electric Co. (supra), Associate Builders vs. Delhi
Co. Ltd. vs. National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) (supra) and
Vijay Karia & Ors. vs. Prysmian Cavi E Sistemi SRL & Ors. (supra).
45.    Adverting to the principles of law as discussed above in the context
of the challenge to the arbitral award as mounted in the present
proceedings, it needs to be stated that the contention as urged on behalf of
the petitioner that the impugned award needs to be interfered on the
ground that the same is in conflict with the basic notions of morality and
justice cannot be accepted, when the challenge is primarily on the ground
that the claims as made by the respondent were barred by limitation.
46.    As discussed above the arbitral tribunal has considered the
respondent’s claims being not barred by limitation by recording a finding
of fact that there was a running account between the parties and which
clearly stood established from materials on record. Question is whether
such finding of fact be re-examined by appreciating evidence. The answer
would be an obvious no. When the petitioner poses such question, it is
implicit that it is nothing different than to call upon the Court to re-
appreciate the evidence and to record a finding contrary to what has been
held by the arbitral tribunal namely that no running account could be
established on the basis of the materials/evidence on record. I am afraid
that such course of action is at all be permissible, as this would not only
involve re-appreciation of evidence, but the Court in exercise of
jurisdiction under Section 34 of the Act coming to a conclusion different
from what the arbitral tribunal has held as if the proceedings is an appeal.
47.     In any event, the ground of limitation, being a mixed question of
law and fact, can never be a ground which would involve any basic notion
of morality of justice for an arbitral award to be set aside. This would also
entail a review of the award on the merits of the disputes. It is also well
settled as observed by the Supreme Court in Associate Builders vs. Delhi
Development Authority (supra) that the arbitral tribunal is the master of
the quantity and quality of evidence and it is the final adjudicator on such
questions. It is also well settled that the Courts would not interfere merely
because an alternative view on facts would exist. The Court would also
not interfere in an arbitral award, if a possible view is taken by the arbitral
tribunal on the basis of material before it. It is thus totally unsuitable for
the petitioner to urge that the impugned award is required to be interfered
by this Court, by coming to a conclusion that the impugned award is in
conflict with the basic notions of morality of justice.
48.     Further the petitioner’s assertion that in the facts of the present case,
the principles of the arbitral award being in conflict with public policy of
India, and/or it is in contravention with the fundamental policy of Indian
law, stand attracted, when an issue of the claims being barred by limitation
are canvassed, is an assertion not well founded. This for the reason that
this is not a case where an ex facie and a brazenly time barred claim or a
deadwood, was awarded by the arbitral tribunal of a nature which would
shock the conscience of the Court. The issue of limitation in the present
case clearly being a mixed question of law and fact was examined by the
arbitral tribunal on materials/evidence on record, so as to come to a factual
finding that the claim as made by the respondent was within the
prescribed limitation.
49.    In the light of the above discussion, no case has been made out for
interference in the impugned arbitral award within the limited jurisdiction
of the Court under Section 34 of the Act. The petition is accordingly
50.    In view of dismissal of the petition, interim application would not
survive. It is accordingly disposed of.
51.     At this stage, learned counsel for the parties have drawn the Court’s
attention to an order dated 14 February, 2022 passed by a co-ordinate
Bench of this Court (B.P. Colabawalla, J.) on Interim Application No. 489
of 2021 in Execution Application (L) No. 8094 of 2020 filed by the
respondent whereunder impugned award was sought to be executed. By
such order, the petitioner was directed to furnish a bank guarantee of the
award amount with a further direction that the bank guarantee shall abide
by the orders to be passed by this Court in section 34 petition and that any
further directions in relation to the bank guarantee shall be given by the
Court hearing the Section 34 petition, namely, the present proceedings.
Accordingly, the bank guarantee as furnished by the petitioners was of an
amount of Rs.2,91,84,139/- of the Kotak Mahindra Bank. The relevant
part of the said order passed by the co-ordinate Bench of this Court is
required to be noted, which reads thus:
“6.      The furnishing of this bank guarantee shall abide by the orders
passed by this Court in the Section 34 Petition or any interlocutory
applications filed therein. Any further directions in relation to the
aforesaid bank guarantee shall be given by the Court hearing the Section
34 Petition filed by the Judgment Debtor herein. The Judgment Creditor
is also at liberty to make an appropriate application in the Section 34
proceedings seeking a withdrawal of this amount. If any applications are
filed in the Section 34 proceedings, they shall be disposed of on their own
merits and in accordance with law uninfluenced by any observations in
this order.”
52.     In view of above orders passed by this Court, there are two requests
made before the Court on pronouncement of the above orders dismissing
the section 34 petition. The first request is on behalf of the respondent
that the respondent be permitted to encash the bank guarantee.                         In
opposition, there is a request on behalf of the petitioner that as the
petitioner intends to assail the order passed on the present Section 34
proceedings, encashment of bank guarantee by the respondent be deferred
for some period. It is stated that the bank guarantee is kept alive till the
pendency of the proceedings.
53.    In the above circumstances, in my opinion, to enable the petitioner
to assail the present order before the Supreme Court, the respondent is
directed not to encash the bank guarantee for a period of 15 days from
