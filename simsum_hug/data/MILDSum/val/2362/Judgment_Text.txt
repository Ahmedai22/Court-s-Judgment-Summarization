(1)  These   appeals   have  been    filed  by   the   Uttar
Pradesh State Road Transport Corporation (for short,
“Corporation”) challenging the orders dated 18.07.2017
and 03.12.2009 whereby the appeal filed by the first
respondent-National   Insurance    Co.  Ltd.   (for   short,
“Insurance Company”) has been disposed of in terms of
judgment and order dated 18.09.2009 passed by the High
Court of judicature at Allahabad, Lucknow Bench, in
F.A.F.O. No. 199 of 2001 and batch of matters.
(2)  The appellant-Corporation had hired a bus bearing
No.UP32T/1459  from   respondent   no.9   under  a   written
contract  dated   20.05.1998.    The  said   bus  was   duly
insured by respondent no.9 with the Insurance Company
vide Cover Note No.015425 dated 25.02.1998, for the
period 28.02.1998 upto 27.02.1999.          On 25.08.1998 a
fatal motor vehicle accident took place involving the
said bus which resulted in the death of Rajitram @
Raju.   A claim petition bearing MACT NO.161/70/98 was
filed by the legal heirs of the deceased before the
Pradesh.   The Corporation filed its written statement
bringing on record the contract entered into between
the  Corporation   and  the   bus   owner   as  well  as  the
factum  of  insurance   of  the   bus   with   the  Insurance
Company.    The Insurance Company filed its response
admitting the existence of the Insurance Policy with
respect to the said bus during the relevant period.
(3)   The M.A.C.T., on appreciation of the materials on
record, by an Award dated 30.11.2006 held that the
Insurance Company is liable to pay compensation of
Rs.1,82,000/-   with  interest    at  the   rate   of 6%  per
annum to the claimants.
(4)   The Insurance Company preferred an appeal before
the High Court of Judicature at Allahabad, Lucknow
Bench, in F.A.F.O. No.219 of 2007 mainly on the ground
that  it  is  not  liable   to  pay   the   compensation   as
awarded  by  the   M.A.C.T.   as the  Corporation   was
operating the said bus when the accident took place.
Thus, the Corporation was liable to satisfy the Award.
(5)  It is relevant to note here that the High Court
of Judicature at Allahabad, Lucknow Bench, has passed
a judgment dated 18.09.2009 in F.A.F.O. NO.199 of 2001
and other connected matters holding that the Insurance
Companies are not liable to pay compensation to the
third parties in the event the buses were operated
under the control of the Corporation.    Subsequently,
the appeal filed by the Corporation was allowed by the
(6)  We have heard learned counsel for the parties and
perused the materials placed on record.
(7)  The question that falls for our consideration in
the instant appeal is: if an insured vehicle is plying
under an agreement with the Corporation on the route
as per permit granted in favour of the Corporation and
in case of any accident during that period, whether
the  Insurance   Company   would  be  liable   to  pay
compensation or would it be the responsibility of the
(8)     This question has been answered by this Court in
Uttar     Pradesh    State  Road   Transport    Corporation  v.
Kulsum and Others1 which is an identical case where
the Supreme Court examined the agreement entered into
between the Corporation and the owner of the vehicle.
The Court has come to the conclusion that when the
effective control and command of the bus is with the
Corporation, the Corporation becomes the owner of the
vehicle for the specified period. It was further held
that when the actual possession of the vehicle is with
the    Corporation,     the   vehicle,  the    driver  and  the
conductor        were   under    the   direct     control   and
supervision of the Corporation. Therefore, through the
definition of “vicarious liability” it can be inferred
that the person supervising the driver is liable to
pay the compensation to the victim.          During such time,
however,      it   will  be  deemed  that   that   vehicle  was
transferred along with the insurance policy, even if
it were insured at the instance of the original owner.
Thus,     the   Insurance   Company   would   not  be  able  to
escape       its    liability    to   pay    the    amount   of
compensation.
(9)  Having regard to the above, we are of the view
that the High Court was not justified in fastening the
liability upon the appellant-Corporation.           Thus, the
appeals   succeed   and   are  accordingly    allowed.    The
impugned judgments of the High Court are hereby set
aside and the judgment of the Trial Court is restored.
(10) At this stage, learned counsel for the appellant-
Corporation submits that the appellant-Corporation has
deposited a sum of Rs.4,10,128/- before the M.A.C.T.,
Bahraich,    Uttar    Pradesh    before    filing   of  these
appeals.
(11)    In   view  of   above,   we   permit  the  appellant-
Corporation to withdraw the said amount with accrued
interest    thereon    if   any,    and   direct  the   first
respondent-National Insurance Co. Ltd. to deposit a
sum of Rs.1,82,000/- along with interest on the above
compensation amount at the rate of 6% per annum from
the date of filing of the claim petition till the date
of deposit.     The deposit, as above, shall be made by
the Insurance Company before the M.A.C.T., Bahraich,
U.P., within a period of six weeks from today.           Upon
deposit, the claimants are permitted to withdraw the
said amount.
(12) We direct the parties to bear their respective
costs.
Date : 14-07-2021 These matters were called on for hearing today.
