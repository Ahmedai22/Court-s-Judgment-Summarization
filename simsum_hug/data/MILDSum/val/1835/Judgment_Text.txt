Rule. Rule made returnable forthwith. The petition is
heard finally by consent of the learned advocates for the parties.
02]          In this criminal writ petition, the petitioner has
challenged the order passed by the respondent No.1-Deputy
Commissioner of Police, Amravati Zone-1 dated 5 th April, 2022,
whereby he was ordered to be externed from the Amravati City as
well as Amravati District and also the order dated 28 th September,
2022 passed by the Appellate Authority-Respondent No.3
confirming the order of externment passed by the respondent No.1
03]           The facts leading to the filing of the petition can be
summarized as follows:
The   respondent      No.1    initiated   proceeding       for
externment of the petitioner from Amravati District by invoking
the provisions of Section 56(1)(b) of the Maharashtra Police Act,
1951 (for short “the Act of 1951”). The respondent No.1 to record
his subjective satisfaction, relied upon the following crimes. The
said crimes are set out hereinbelow in tabulated form:
Sr.    Police   Crime No.          Section          Dated       Case status

04]          The respondent No.1 conducted necessary inquiry. He
issued a notice to the petitioner on 4th March, 2022 to show cause
as to why he should not be externed from the Amravati District.
The respondent No.1, based on the material collected, passed the
order of externment on 5th April, 2022. The petitioner challenged
the said order by filing an appeal before the respondent No.3. The
respondent No.3 vide order dated 28th September, 2022 though
found certain deficiencies in the order of externment, dismissed the
appeal and confirmed the said order.
05]         The learned advocate for the petitioner submitted that
out of five crimes registered at Frezarpura Police Station for the
various offences committed under the provisions of the Indian
Penal Code, 1860 (for short “IPC”), the petitioner was acquitted in
four crimes before issuance of notice. The learned advocate
submitted that while arriving at subjective satisfaction, four crimes
at Serial Nos.1 to 4 in which he was acquitted were taken into
consideration. The learned advocate further submitted that four
crimes registered against the petitioner at Frezarpura Police Station
were for commission of offences under Section 65(e) of the
Maharashtra Prohibition Act, 1949 (for short “the Prohibition
Act”). The learned advocate submitted that for the purpose of
passing an externment order under Section 56(1)(b), the offences
under the Prohibition Act cannot be taken into consideration. In
order to substantiate this submission, he has placed reliance on the
decision in the case of Dhananjay Manohar Sapkal Vs. State of
Maharashtra and Another [2005(2) Mh.L.J. 384] . The learned
advocate submitted that after excluding the crimes in which he was
acquitted as well as the crimes under the Prohibition Act, only one
crime at Serial No.5 registered at Frezarpura Police Station bearing
Crime No.156/2017 was available to be considered by the
respondent No.1. The learned advocate, therefore, submitted that
the respondent No.1 took into consideration the stale crimes in
which he was acquitted. It is further submitted that apart from the
crimes being stale, there is no live link in those crimes as well as the
proposed action. The learned advocate submitted that a reference
has been made to the in-camera statements of the confidential
witnesses. By drawing my attention to the show cause notice dated
4th March, 2022, the learned advocate submitted that there was no
mention of these statements in the show cause notice. The learned
advocate further submitted that the statements of the confidential
witnesses indicate that the same were recorded before issuance of
notice. The learned advocate further submitted that the respondent
No.1 did not record the reasons for externment of the petitioner
from entire Amravati District and that too for a period of two
years. The learned advocate submitted that in the absence of the
reasons, the order passed by the respondent No.1 and confirmed by
the respondent No.3 suffers from the virus of excessiveness.
06]          The learned APP submitted that after passing the order
of externment, the petitioner indulged in the commission of the
similar crimes. The learned APP took me through the FIRs
registered in those crimes. Based on these FIRs, the learned APP
submitted that the same are sufficient to reflect upon the overall
conduct and behaviour of the petitioner. The learned APP further
submitted that the petitioner did not file the reply to the show
cause notice and, therefore, the respondent No.1 had no occasion
to know that he was acquitted in four crimes. The learned APP
further submitted that the remaining crimes registered against the
petitioner are sufficient to justify the order. The learned APP
submitted that the statements of the confidential witnesses are
sufficient to reflect upon the dangerous nature of the petitioner
and overall threat to the public peace and tranquility. As far as the
offences under the Prohibition Act is concerned, the learned APP
submitted that in addition to the crimes registered under the IPC,
to consider the overall conduct of the petitioner in indulging the
repetitive crimes, would give a fair idea of the activities of the
petitioner and ultimately warranting his externment.
07]          It is to be noted that in order to justify the order under
Section 56(1)(b) of the Act of 1951, reliance was placed on four
crimes under the Prohibition Act. It is true that the cases for
commission of those offences are pending against the petitioner in
the Court of Law. In the case of Dhananjay Manohar Sapkal
(supra), the Coordinate Bench of this Court has held that the
offences registered under the Prohibition Act or under the
Maharashtra Prevention of Gambling Act, 1887 (for short “the
Gambling Act”) cannot be taken into consideration for the purpose
of passing an externment order. In this case, the Coordinate Bench
of this Court has considered the provisions of Section 56(1)
Clauses (a) and (b) of the Act of 1951 and held that the offences
under the Prohibition Act or the Gambling Act would fall outside
the scope of the offences and activities contemplated under Clauses
(a) and (b) of Section 56(1) of the Act of 1951. It is to be noted
that the offences contemplated under Section 56(1)(b) of the Act
of 1951 are relating to coin and government stamps, offences
affecting the human body and the offences against the property. It
is pertinent to note that the repetitive indulgence in the offences
relating to the human body by and large have a tendency to affect
the public peace and tranquility. The above offences apart from
resulting in breach of peace and tranquility have a tendency to
harm the society at large. In my view, therefore, this aspect needs to
be borne in mind while appreciating the submissions made by the
learned advocates.
08]          Perusal of Section 56(1) Clauses (a) and (b) of the Act
of 1951 would show that the subjective satisfaction for passing
externment order cannot be recorded on the basis of the offences
registered under the Prohibition Act. Therefore, on this ground,
the dent has been caused to the so-called subjective satisfaction,
sought to be relied upon by the respondents to substantiate the
09]         The next important point is with regard to the
consideration of the crimes in which the petitioner was acquitted to
record the subjective satisfaction. In order to justify the reliance on
these crimes, the learned APP submitted that the petitioner did not
file the reply to the show cause notice and, therefore, the
respondent No.1 had no reason to know that he was acquitted in
those crimes. In my view, this submission is self-contradictory to
the subjective satisfaction, recorded in the externment order. This
submission would indicate that the respondent No.1 was not
supposed to make an inquiry whether the cases are pending or the
cases have been disposed of. It is to be noted that in all the crimes,
the petitioner was released on bail. The respondent No.1 was,
therefore, required to make a thorough inquiry and that too by
perusing the bail orders in those matters, to come to a definite
conclusion that the activities of the petitioner are in all respect
covered by Section 56(1)(b). The reliance upon the crimes in
which the petitioner was acquitted would indicate that the inquiry
was flawed. It needs to be emphasized that the subjective
satisfaction for passing such an order must be arrived at on the
basis of the objective material. In the present case, the material,
which could not have been taken into consideration at all, has been
stated to be objective material to arrive at subjective satisfaction.
On this ground also the satisfaction recorded is substantially
10]          After excluding the four crimes in which he was
acquitted as well as the four crimes which are under the Prohibition
Act, the only one crime at Serial No.5 registered at Frezarpura
Police Station being Crime No.156/2017 was available for being
considered by the respondent No.1 to form an opinion to proceed
further against the petitioner under Section 56 of the Act of 1951.
It is to be noted that this crime is also stale crime. The same could
not have been taken into consideration at all. The show cause
notice is dated 4th March, 2022. The crime at Serial No.5 was
registered in the year 2017. It is, therefore, apparent that the
respondent No.1 took into consideration a crime, which was
registered five years prior to the issuance of notice. The sole crime
apart from being a stale crime for this purpose, would also not be
sufficient to establish the live link for passing the impugned order.
The live link in this case was, therefore, completely snapped. In my
view, therefore, based on this crime alone, the order of externment
was not at all justified.
11]         Perusal of the show cause notice as well as the order
passed by the respondent No.1 would indicate that the chapter
cases under Section 110 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1971
were initiated against him. The first case is bearing No.04/2020
and the second case is bearing No.54/2021. At the conclusion of
such proceeding, the party concerned is called upon by the
Executive Magistrate to execute a bond for good behaviour. The
duration of such a bond is normally for a period of six months. The
show cause notice as well as the order of externment is silent with
regard to the execution of bond for good behaviour. The show
cause notice as well as the order is silent on the point whether there
was breach of the undertaking and conditions of the bond executed
in those proceedings. The bond is executed in the proceeding,
which is of preventive nature. This aspect has not been considered
and appropriately dealt with by respondent Nos.1 and 3.
12]         The next important aspect is with regard to the reliance
placed on the statements of the confidential witnesses. The
statement of the first confidential witness was recorded on 10 th
February, 2022 and the statement of the second witness was
recorded on 11th February, 2022. The statements were recorded by
statements were, therefore, admittedly not recorded by the
respondent No.1. The respondent No.1 was, therefore, required to
verify those statements. Perusal of the statements would show that
at the bottom of the statements, there is endorsement “verified”.
The stamp below the signature clearly spells out that those
statements were not verified by the respondent No.1, but those
statements were verified by the Assistant Commissioner of Police.
Even if it is assumed that there was verification, the cryptic manner
of the endorsement to indicate the verification, creates a doubt
about actual verification. The statements were verified on 28 th
February, 2022. The notice in question was issued on 4 th March,
2022. There is no reference of this in-camera statements of the
confidential witnesses in the notice.
13]           Perusal of the externment order would show that the
reliance has been placed on these statements to form a subjective
satisfaction. The respondent No.1, who has passed the externment
order, has not stated in his order that he had personally verified
those statements by securing the presence of the witnesses. In my
view, this exercise was required to be scrupulously conducted. The
statements have been relied upon to form the subjective
satisfaction. It, therefore, goes without saying that the statements of
the confidential witnesses without verification by the respondent
No.1 personally, were made a part of record to pass an externment
order. In my view, this is one more ground to cause serious dent to
the subjective satisfaction recorded in the impugned order.
14]          It is to be noted that this order passed by the
respondent No.1 and confirmed by the respondent No.3 suffers
from the virus of excessiveness. The order of externment apart
from making inroads on the personal liberty guaranteed under the
Constitution of India, makes the said person live separate from his
family members. Similarly, the externment order can deprive the
said person of his livelihood. In the given case, depending upon
the financial position of the person, it can make the dependents of
the said person to starve. Therefore, in order to justify the
externment for a maximum period of two years, the Authority is
required to consider the objective material to record subjective
satisfaction on all points. In this case, I am constrained to observe
that the order passed by the respondent No.1 is woefully silent on
all these points. The respondent No.1 has not recorded the reasons
to order the externment of the petitioner for a period of two years
and that too from the entire Amravati District. It is seen on perusal
of the notice and order that all the crimes committed by the
petitioner were within the jurisdiction of Frezarpura Police Station,
15]         In my considered opinion, therefore, the order passed
by the respondent No.1 and confirmed by the respondent No.3
suffers from the virus of excessiveness. The law laid down on the
point in the cases of Shaikh Mukhtyar S/o Mustafa Shaikh Vs.
State of Maharashtra and Others [2017 ALL.M.R. (Cri.) 268 and
Bhagwat Dadasaheb Landge and Another Vs. State of Maharashtra
and Others [2020(5) Mh.L.J. (Cri.) 546] , would, therefore, equally
apply in this case. It is to be noted that the excessive nature of the
order on both the counts is one of the factors, which would weigh
in favour of the petitioner. The order of externment, making a
direct inroads on the fundamental right of movement, must,
therefore, pass all the legal tests. In this case, the order passed by
the respondent No.1 and confirmed by the respondent No.3 do
not pass the said test. It is to be noted that the respondent No.3
despite being confronted with the factual position vis-a-vis the
acquittal of the petitioner in four crimes and his involvement in
four crimes under the Prohibition Act, confirmed the said order.
Perusal of the order of the respondent No.3 would show that the
respondent No.3 has recorded factual submissions, but failed to
sufficiently deal with the same. Therefore, in my view, this order is
not sustainable.
16]          Accordingly, the writ petition is allowed. The order
dated 5th April, 2022 passed by the respondent No.1-Deputy
Commissioner of Police, Zone-1 Amravati City externing the
petitioner from Amravati District for a period of two years and the
order dated 28th September, 2022 passed by the respondent No.3-
Divisional Commissioner of Amravati confirming the said order of
externment are quashed and set aside.
17]          Rule is made absolute in above terms. The writ petition
is disposed of.
