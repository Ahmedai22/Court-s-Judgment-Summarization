Custody certificate dated 19.08.2022 by way of affidavit of the
Deputy Superintendent, Central Jail, Hoshiarpur, filed in the Court, is taken
on record.
The petitioner was tried in case bearing FIR No.40 dated
29.03.2013, registered at Police Station Bullowal, District Hoshiarpur,
under Sections 279 and 304-A IPC. Learned Judicial Magistrate Ist Class,
Hoshiarpur, vide judgment and order dated 03.11.2017, found the
petitioner guilty for the offence punishable under Sections 279 and 304-A
IPC and sentenced him as under:
279 IPC        To undergo rigorous imprisonment for a period of three
months.
304-A IPC      To undergo rigorous imprisonment for a period of one year.
Aggrieved there-against, the petitioner preferred an appeal
before the learned Addl. Sessions Judge, Hoshiarpur, which had been
dismissed vide impugned judgment dated 07.02.2022.
Still aggrieved, the petitioner has preferred the present revision
During the course of hearing, learned counsel for the petitioner
does not lay any challenge to the judgments of conviction of the petitioner
recorded by the courts below and for that reason, the facts are not required
to be reproduced here.
Learned counsel for the petitioner has made submissions only
on the aspect of sentence on which this Court has heard him as well as the
learned State counsel.
While making submissions qua the quantum of sentence,
learned counsel for the petitioner would submit that the petitioner is a first
offender; that he has no shady past; that he has been facing the agony of the
trial since 2013; that he is the only bread winning member of his family,
and that his conduct during the trial has been quite fair and bona fide and
he has never obstructed the course of trial and the appeal. The petitioner
has already undergone the actual sentence of 06 months and 12 days as
19.08.2022. He has also earned remissions of 25 days.             Under these
circumstances, the sentence imposed upon the petitioner may be reduced to
the one already undergone by him.
On the other hand, learned State counsel, while opposing the
submissions made by the learned counsel for the petitioner, would submit
that the sentence awarded to the petitioner is in proportion to the offence
committed by him. The petitioner does not deserve any leniency.
I have heard the learned counsel for the parties.
Having heard the learned counsel for the parties and after a
lucid examination of the record, this Court finds that both the courts below
have rightly convicted and sentenced the petitioner under Sections 279 and
304-A IPC. There is no manifest error in the concurrent findings recorded
by the courts below.
Thus, in my opinion, in view of the evidence on record, there
is no scope for any interference in the findings of the Courts below, so far
as the conviction under Sections             279 and 304-A IPC.             Hence, the
conviction of the petitioner under the aforesaid sections is upheld.
However, the fact remains that the present FIR was registered
on 29.03.2013 and out of the substantive sentence of 01 year, the petitioner
has undergone the actual sentence of 06 months and 12 days as on
19.08.2022. He has also earned remissions of 25 days.
The Hon’ble Supreme Court in State of Punjab Vs. Saurabh
Bakshi, 2015(2) RCR (Criminal) 495, while setting aside the order of the
High Court, thereby reducing the sentence imposed upon the accused i.e. 1
year to the period already undergone by him i.e. 24 days, awarded the
sentence of six months to the accused-respondent therein. It was held as
“17. In the instant case the factum of rash and negligent driving has
been established. This court has been constantly noticing the increase in
number of road accidents and has also noticed how the vehicle drivers
have been totally rash and negligent. It seems to us driving in a drunken
state, in a rash and negligent manner or driving with youthful
adventurous enthusiasm as if there are no traffic rules or no discipline
of law has come to the centre stage.
The protagonists, as we perceive, have lost all respect for law. A
man with the means has, in possibility, graduated himself to harbour the
idea that he can escape from the substantive sentence by payment of
compensation. Neither the law nor the court that implements the law
should ever get oblivious of the fact that in such accidents precious lives
are lost or the victims who survive are crippled for life which, in a way,
worse than death. Such developing of notions is a dangerous
phenomenon in an orderly society. Young age cannot be a plea to be
accepted in all circumstances. Life to the poor or the impecunious is as
worth living for as it is to the rich and the luxuriously temperamental.
Needless to say, the principle of sentencing recognizes the corrective
measures but there are occasions when the deterrence is an imperative
necessity depending upon the facts of the case. In our opinion, it is a fit
case where we are constrained to say that the High Court has been
swayed away by the passion of mercy in applying the principle that
payment of compensation is a factor for reduction of sentence to 24
days. It is absolutely in the realm of misplaced sympathy. It is, in a way
mockery of justice. Because justice is "the crowning glory", "the
sovereign mistress" and "queen of virtue" as Cicero had said. Such a
crime blights not only the lives of the victims but of many others around
them. It ultimately shatters the faith of the public in judicial system. In
our view, the sentence of one year as imposed by the trial Magistrate
which has been affirmed by the appellate court should be reduced to six
months.”
Taking into consideration the agony of trial faced by the
petitioner for the period of 9½ years and further in view of the judgment of
the Hon'ble Apex Court in Saurabh Bakshi's case (supra), in my opinion,
the ends of justice would be suitably met, if the substantive sentence
imposed upon the petitioner is reduced to the period already undergone by
In view of the above, while upholding the conviction of the
petitioner under Sections 279 and 304-A IPC, the substantive sentence
imposed upon the petitioner is reduced to the one already undergone by
Apart from that, the petitioner is directed to pay a sum of
Rs.50,000/- (Rs.25,000/- to the LRs of each deceased) as compensation to
the legal heirs of deceased-Kuldeep Singh and Sucha Singh, within a
period of two months from today.
It is made clear that in case, the compensation amount is not
paid within the stipulated time, the present revision petition shall be
deemed to have been dismissed. The petitioner be released forthwith if not
required in any other case.
