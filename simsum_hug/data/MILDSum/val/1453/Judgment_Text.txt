The captioned writ petition is filed by the plaintiffs feeling
aggrieved by the order of the learned Judge passed on
I.A.No.13 filed under Order 6 Rule 17 of CPC.
2.    The present petitioners have instituted a suit for
partition and separate possession in O.S.No.32/2015 by
specifically contending that suit schedule property are joint
family ancestral properties.    The petitioners claim that they
are entitled for 1/5th share in the suit schedule properties.
The petitioners have also sought relief of declaration to
declare    that   the  judgment      and     decree    passed      in
O.S.No.61/1998 is not binding on their legitimate share.
Consequently, sale deed dated 26.04.2014 executed by
defendant Nos.1 and 2 in favour of defendant No.6 is also
3.     When the matter was set in for further cross-
examination of plaintiffs, the present petitioners/plaintiffs have
come up with this proposed amendment. By way of proposed
amendment, plaintiffs intend to incorporate the pleadings
relating to sale transactions done by defendant No.1 in favour
of defendant No.5.         The plaintiffs by way of proposed
amendment want to further plead that judgment and decree
passed in O.S.No.61/1998 is a collusive decree which was
passed on a fraudulent registered sale agreement.              The
plaintiffs also intend to plead that there was no legal necessity
for the defendant No.1 to enter into a transaction with
defendant No.5 and further want to plead that defendant No.1
was addicted to vices.
4.    The said contention is rejected by the learned
Judge. While rejecting the application filed in I.A.No.13, the
learned Judge was of the view that no sufficient cause is made
out by the plaintiffs while seeking the amendment.            The
learned Judge has found fault with the plaintiffs for not
seeking amendment before commencement of trial.               The
application filed in I.A.No.13 is rejected by recording a finding
that plaintiffs cannot overcome the admissions elicited in
5.    Heard learned counsel appearing for the petitioners
and learned counsel appearing for the contesting respondents.
6.    Admittedly, the present suit is one for partition and
separate possession. When the matter was set in for further
cross-examination,      the  plaintiffs by   way   of   proposed
amendment intend to incorporate para 5(a).         In para 5(a),
plaintiffs intend to plead additional pleadings relating to
transactions between defendant Nos.1 and 5.        The proposed
amendment does not change the fundamental character of the
suit.   It is trite law that all amendments are to be liberally
allowed relegating the parties to substantiate their claim even
in respect of proposed amendment. Thought this Court would
find some laxness on the part of plaintiffs in not seeking
amendment before commencement of trial but, however, to
advance justice, a reasonable opportunity needs to be given to
7.     In a partition suit, valuable property rights are
involved. If a property is a joint family ancestral property, it
goes without saying that the members of a joint family have a
pre-existing     right and   therefore, the  Court   drawing   a
preliminary decree merely declares the pre-existing right. It is
in this background, this Court is not inclined to adopt a hyper
technical approach and decline the plaintiffs in proving their
case by incorporating the proposed amendment.              Mere
allowing the amendment application in itself would not amount
to granting the relief sought in the proposed amendment. The
burden still remains on the plaintiffs to establish the claim
made in the proposed amendment.
8.    This Court is also of the view that no serious
prejudice will be caused to the respondents/defendants if the
proposed amendment is allowed.           The material on record
would also indicate that it is only when a counter claim was
filed by defendant No.4, the Court had to frame additional
issues and therefore, the plaintiffs have sought to amend this
plaint seeking leave to incorporate the proposed para 5(a). As
against this proposed amendment, it is always open for the
respondents/defendants to file additional written statement.
It is always open for the respondents/defendants to lead
rebuttal   evidence    insofar  as   proposed   amendment     is
concerned. Therefore, I am of the view that the order under
challenge is not at all sustainable.
9.    Accordingly, I pass the following:
(i) The writ petition is allowed;
(ii) The impugned order dated 28.11.2018
passed on I.A.No.13 in O.S.No.32/2015 is set
aside    and   consequently,      the  application   is
(iii) The petitioners/plaintiffs are permitted
to amend the plaint.
(iv)    The    respondents/defendants        are
reserved with liberty to file additional written
statement, if they chose to do so.
