compensation of Rs.3,00,000/- was directed to be paid to the wife of the
deceased, Petitioner No.1 – Smt. Kameshwari Devi, and a sum of
Rs.1,00,000/- each was directed to be paid to the daughters of the deceased,
Petitioner No.2 – Ms. Pooja and Petitioner No.3 – Ms. Poonam. The
operative portion of the said order dated 22nd December, 2020 is extracted
“An affidavit of dependency has been filed by Smt.
Kameshwari Devi, wife of deceased according to
which the deceased is survived by her and her
children. So, Smt. Kameshwari Devi, wife of
deceased, Poonam and Pooja (daughters of
deceased) are entitled for compensation.
The committee has also considered other
provisions of Delhi Victim Compensation Scheme,
2018. Upon considering the same, the Committee
is of the considered view that the case of the
deceased falls under SI. No.1 and Part-I of the
Schedule to the Delhi Victim Compensation
Scheme, 2018 and as such, final compensation of
Rs.5,00,000/- (Rupees Five Lac Only) should be
paid to the following LRs of the deceased in
proportion mentioned below:
SI. Name           of Bank       Account No.        IFSC Code      Amount
No. victim/LRs        Name &

Thus, in exercise of power under Section 357A(2)
of Cr.P.C. it is recommended that a sum of Rs.
3,00,000/- (Rupees Three Lac Only) to be paid to
Smt. Kameshwari Devi (wife of deceased) and a
sum of Rs.1,00,000/- (Rupees One Lac Only)
each to be paid to Ms. Poonam and Ms Pooja
(daughters of deceased) as Final Compensation
from the Victim Compensation Fund constituted
under Rule 3 of the Delhi Victim Compensation
3.      The background of the present case is that the deceased, who was an
auto rickshaw driver, unfortunately passed away in an accident on 9th
August, 2019, while he was driving his auto near ITO and an unknown
vehicle hit him. An FIR bearing No.193/19 was lodged in respect of the
said incident at P.S. I.P. Estate. The investigation which took place in the
matter could not identify the persons or the vehicle which caused the
accident, leading to a closing order dated 22nd September, 2020 passed by
the MACT Court, Tis Hazari Courts, Delhi, whereby the legal
representatives of the deceased were granted liberty to approach the
Secretary, Delhi State Legal Service Authority (hereinafter, “DSLSA”) or
the concerned SDM for grant of compensation in accordance with law.
4.      The deceased is survived by his wife and three children i.e., two
daughters and a son. All of the three children have now attained the age of
majority. The said LRs of the deceased, who are the Petitioners herein, had
approached the DSLSA for award of compensation under the Delhi Victims
Compensations Scheme, 2018. The said Authority, after considering the
matter, awarded a total sum of Rs.5,00,000/-, vide order dated 22nd
Digitally Signed        W.P.(C) 13161/2021                                                Page 3 of 9
December, 2020, as extracted hereinabove. It is this order which is under
challenge in the present petition.
5.      Ld. Counsel for the Petitioner submits that, due to the investigation
having not resulted in identifying any of the culprits who caused the
accident, the family of the deceased has not received any insurance amount
under the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988. In addition, it is submitted that, one of
the daughters i.e., Petitioner No.3 - Ms. Poonam is presently undergoing
treatment with the Institute of Human Behaviour and Allied Sciences
(IHBAS), and is unable to get any employment due to the mental trauma on
account of her father’s death.
6.      The second daughter, the Petitioner No.2 - Ms. Pooja, who is present
in Court, submits that she is undertaking a course in banking. The son of the
deceased is also present in Court and submits that he was earlier employed
in the marketing department of an insurance company, however, he is
currently unemployed.
7.      Ld. Counsel for Respondent Nos.2 and 3 submits that, under the Delhi
Victims Compensation Scheme, 2018, the minimum limit of compensation
is Rs.3,00,000/- and the upper limit is Rs.10,00,000/-. The impugned order
dated 22nd December, 2020 has considered the various factors for awarding
compensation under Clause 8 of the Delhi Victims Compensation Scheme,
2018, as per which one of the factors is financial loss to the victim or
dependants, as also, the financial condition of the deceased.
8.      Heard ld. Counsels for the parties, as also, Petitioners present in
Court. The legal framework for the award of compensation to the victims of
crime or the dependents of such victims emanates from Section 357A of the
Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973. The said legal provision is reproduced
Digitally Signed        W.P.(C) 13161/2021                                                 Page 4 of 9
“[357A. Victim compensation scheme.—(1) Every
State Government in co-ordination with the Central
Government shall prepare a scheme for providing
funds for the purpose of compensation to the victim or
his dependents who have suffered loss or injury as a
result of the crime and who require rehabilitation.
(2) Whenever a recommendation is made by the Court
for compensation, the District Legal Service Authority
or the State Legal Service Authority, as the case may
be, shall decide the quantum of compensation to be
awarded under the scheme referred to in sub-section
(3) If the trial Court, at the conclusion of the trial, is
satisfied, that the compensation awarded under section
357 is not adequate for such rehabilitation, or where
the cases end in acquittal or discharge and the victim
has to be rehabilitated, it may make recommendation
for compensation.
(4) Where the offender is not traced or identified, but
the victim is identified, and where no trial takes place,
the victim or his dependents may make an application
to the State or the District Legal Services Authority for
award of compensation.
(5) On receipt of such recommendations or on the
application under sub-section (4), the State or the
District Legal Services Authority shall, after due
enquiry award adequate compensation by completing
the enquiry within two months.
(6) The State or the District Legal Services Authority,
as the case may be, to alleviate the suffering of the
victim, may order for immediate first-aid facility or
medical benefits to be made available free of cost on
the certificate of the police officer not below the rank
of the officer in charge of the police station or a
Magistrate of the area concerned, or any other interim
relief as the appropriate authority deems fit.]”

9.      Further, the factors that ought to be taken into consideration while
awarding compensation under the Delhi Victim Compensation Scheme,
2018, are stipulated in Clause 8 which is set out below:
AWARDING COMPENSATION - While deciding

may consider just and sufficient.”
10.     It is pertinent to note the observations of the Supreme Court in
Ankush Shivaji Gaikwad v. State of Maharashtra [(2013) 6 SCC 770],
wherein the Court emphasized that Section 357A, confers a power as also a
duty on the courts to apply its mind to the question of awarding
compensation in facts of each case. The relevant observations of the
Supreme Court are extracted below:
“50. Applying the tests which emerge from the above
cases to Section 357, it appears to us that the
provision confers a power coupled with a duty on the
Courts to apply its mind to the question of awarding
compensation in every criminal case. We say so
because in the background and context in which it was
introduced, the power to award compensation was
intended to reassure the victim that he or she is not
forgotten in the criminal justice system. The victim
would remain forgotten in the criminal justice system if
despite Legislature having gone so far as to enact
specific provisions relating to victim compensation,
Digitally Signed        W.P.(C) 13161/2021                                                    Page 7 of 9
Courts choose to ignore the provisions altogether and
do not even apply their mind to the question of
compensation. It follows that unless Section 357 is
read to confer an obligation on Courts to apply their
mind to the question of compensation, it would defeat
the very object behind the introduction of the
provision.”
11.     In the present case, the deceased was an auto driver and he had a
reasonable monthly income, considering that he was plying his auto-
rickshaw in Delhi. He passed way at the age of forty-six. Hence, it can be
reasonably stated that the deceased would have been able to continue to earn
income from plying of the auto-rickshaw at least for the next fifteen years.
Even if the average income of the deceased is taken to be Rs.25,000/- per
month, the loss of income to his family, due to the death of the deceased,
would be substantial in nature.
12.     Further, it is usually seen in such accident matters that the family of
the deceased not only receives compensation, if found eligible, under the
Victim Compensation Scheme, 2018, but the MACT Court after conducting
the due enquiry and on the basis of the investigation undertaken by the
police, awards compensation to the family of the deceased under the Motor
Vehicles Act, 1988. In the present case, the family of the deceased has been
completely deprived of any compensation under the Motor Vehicles Act,
1988, due to the non-tracing of the culprits who caused the accident.
13.     Considering the medical condition of the Petitioner No.3, as also, the
fact that the family is currently surviving only on the income which is
obtained from the auto-rickshaw, which has been rented out to a third-party,
this Court is of the opinion that the compensation awarded to the Petitioners
ought to be enhanced to the maximum amount of Rs.10,00,000/-.

14.     Accordingly, the Respondent No.3 - Delhi State Legal Service
Authority is directed to release a further sum of Rs.5,00,000/- to the
Petitioner No.1 - widow of the deceased, which she would use in the manner
as she deems appropriate, for the welfare of the children and for the family.
15.     In future, whenever the DSLSA considers cases of compensation in
the case of death or grievous injuries, the fact as to whether any amount has
been received from the Insurance Company, or not, would be borne in mind
while awarding the compensation to the victims or the dependents thereof.
16.     The present petition, along with all pending applications, is disposed
of in the above terms.
