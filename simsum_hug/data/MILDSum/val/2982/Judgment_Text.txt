The Appeal has been filed seeking to set aside the order dated
11.9.2018 passed by the Additional District and Sessions Judge, Fast
Track Court, Vellore made in S.C.No.90 of 2017.
2. The appellant stands convicted and sentenced as under:-
302 IPC            Life imprisonment with fine         of Rs.2000/- in
default to undergo rigorous         imprisonment for
another period of one year
352 IPC            Simple imprisonment for 3 months.
3. Brief facts of the prosecution case:-
i) A complaint, Ex.P1 came to be filed by one Poongodi (PW1) of
Valathur in Kanchipuram Taluk, the crux of which is as under:-
She is the niece of one Chinnaponnu (the deceased). The said
Chinnaponnu (the deceased) was living with the appellant/accused for
about two years at Thiruparkuttai and she had no issues. PW1 came
to know from her aunt (the deceased) that the appellant/accused was
already a married man having three girl children. She further came to
know that two daughters of the appellant had once visited the house of
the deceased and thereafter, the appellant/accused had started
demanding the deceased to transfer the said house property in the
name of his daughters born through his first wife to which, she had
refused and thereupon, the appellant/accused, having developed doubt
on the conduct of the deceased, used to pick up frequent quarrel with
her and beat her. On such issue, the deceased had lodged a complaint
with All Women Police Station and the dispute between the parties was
settled by the police by way of compromise, however, on 20.9.2010,
when the deceased was sitting in front of her house and PW1 was
sitting on the road near the house of one Santhi, which is located
opposite to the house of the deceased, the appellant had come to the
spot and picked up quarrel with the deceased saying that the house
belongs to his wife and children and therefore, the deceased should go
out of that house, to which, the deceased had refuted and thereupon,
the appellant, picked up a wooden log which was lying in the nearby
place and gave a blow on the head of the deceased.       PW1 and the
deceased raised alarm. When PW1 tried to prevent the appellant, she
was pushed down by the appellant. Again they raised alarm seeking
help. One Munusamy and Murugesan, viz., P.Ws.2 and 3, who were
near the spot, had come to their rescue, however, the appellant, had
picked up a small knife, which, he was hiding in his waist, and inflicted
a lacerated injury on the neck of the deceased.            The deceased fell
down near the lamp post. The appellant/accused ran away from the
spot.          The injured was taken to C.M.C. Hospital, Vellore      in an
ambulance, where, she succumbed to the injuries after some time.
ii) On receipt of the complaint, Ex.P1, the Sub Inspector of
Police, Thiruvalam Police Station (PW14) had registered the same in
Crime No.272 of 2010 for the offence punishable under Section 302
IPC and sent the FIR, Ex.P15 to the Judicial Magistrate.
iii) The Circle Inspector of Katpadi (PW18), who took up the
investigation on receipt of telephonic call by the Sub Inspector of
Police (PW14) on 21.9.2010, had visited the scene of occurrence and
prepared observation mahazar, Ex.P2 and rough sketch, Ex.P21 in the
presence of witnesses Sadagopan (PW4) and one Paulraj. Thereafter,
he had arranged for taking photographs of the scene of occurrence by
the photographer John @ Sambamoorthy (PW12).                The photographs
and the CD containing compilation of the photographs have been
marked as M.Os.1 and 2.
iv) Thereafter, PW18 had collected blood stains and sample earth
from the scene of occurrence in the presence of the witnesses
Sadagopan and Paulraj under seizure mahazar. The signature of the
witnesses are marked as Ex.P3. Thereafter, at 9.00 am on 21.9.2010,
PW18 had conducted inquest on the dead body at CMC Hospital,
Vellore in the presence of panchayatdars and P.Ws.1 to 3, Ramadoss
and Velu and prepared the inquest report, Ex.P23. Thereafter, He sent
the dead body to Government Hospital, Vellore through the Head
Constable Raja for conducting post mortem. Subsequently, he had
enquired Dr.Ginamaryann Chandy (PW16), who had given first aid to
the victim and record her statement.
v) Dr.Ginamaryann Chandy (PW16), who was on duty at 8.10
pm on 20.9.2010 examined the victim and found that she could not
speak and put her on ventilator as she had difficulty in breathing. She
further found that the victim had bleeding on her face, lower abdomen
and lungs and she had sustained head injury and since the victim had
some impact in her brain, she could not speak.         Since there was
substantial bleeding, the victim was provided with drips, however, she
died within two hours of her admission.      PW16 had recorded in the
medical records at the time of admission to the effect that the victim
had sustained injuries due to the assault by her husband, however,
she could not specifically state as to who had given her such
information.         She had opined that the vital injuries found on the
deceased could be inflicted with the weapon of offence viz., wooden
log, M.O.4.         The death summary issued by PW16 is Ex.P17 and the
death intimation given by the Hospital to the police is Ex.P18.
vi) On receipt of information, PW18 had reached Karikari
Hospital Bus Stand and arrested the appellant/accused, who was
standing there and recorded his voluntary confession in the presence
of witnesses Saravanan and Gokulan viz., P.Ws.5 and 6 and recorded
the same under Ex.P24. On such voluntary confession, PW18 had
seized the blood stained knife M.O.3 produced by the appellant which
was hidden in his waist under seizure mahazar, Ex.P25 and the
wooden log M.O.4 from the drainage near the house of the appellant
as identified by him, in the presence of P.Ws.5 and 6 under seizure
mahazar, Ex.P26.
vii) On return to the police station, PW18, on examining the
appellant/accused,         found  blood   stains  on  the   shirt of the
appellant/accused and recovered the blood stained shirt, M.O.5 under
Form 95. Thereafter, he remanded the appellant to judicial custody.
viii) On 22.9.2010, PW18 had further investigated the case,
enquired the witnesses, Malliga, Murugan, Dhanalakshmi, John @
Sambamoorthy, Senthil, Santhi, Arumugam, Baskar and Janakiraman
and recorded their statements. Then PW18 had issued requisition to
the Inspector of Police, All Women Police Station, Vellore to get the
records in the complaint in Receipt No.723 of 2010 lodged by the
deceased. On 28.9.2010, PW18 had arranged for sending the material
objects to the Forensic Sciences Department.
ix) The Scientific Officer of Forensic Sciences Laboratory, Vellore,
PW17, who received 1-blood stained earth, 2-sample earth, 3-knife, 4-
blood stained wooden log, 5-blood stained shirt, 6-blood stained saree,
7-blood stained inskirt for examination, had found that items 1 and 3
to 7 contained blood stains while item 2 contained no blood stains and
sent them to Serological Department for further examination.                The
report issued by PW17 is Ex.P19. He vouchsafed the serology report,
Ex.P20 issued by           the Junior Scientific Officer of Forensic Sciences
Department to the effect that the report reveals that items 1, 3 to 7
contained human blood and items 5, 6 and 7 contained 'B' group
blood, but, it was inclusive to say the blood group with regard to
items 1, 3 and 4.
x) On 1.10.2010, PW18 had submitted requisition to the Chief
Judicial Magistrate to record the Statements the eyewitnesses, viz.,
P.Ws.1 and 2 and the witnesses to confession statement viz., P.Ws.5
and 6 under Section 164 Cr.P.C. and on 6.10.2010 he had summoned
the said witnesses and produced them before Judicial Magistrate V,
xi) Judicial Magistrate V, Vellore (PW13), on request from the
police, had recorded the 164 Statements of P.Ws.1, 2, 5 and 6 under
Exs.P11 to P14 respectively.
xii) Thereafter, on 30.1.2011, PW18 had collected from the
Inspector of Police, All Women Police Station, Vellore, the case details
and the complaint lodged by the the deceased (Ex.P27) and enquired
the Inspector of Police Suriyakala and recorded her statement.          On
the same day, he had received the post mortem certificate, Ex.P29 and
enquired the Doctor, who conducted the post mortem and recorded his
statement.
xiii) The Doctor, who had conducted the post mortem had opined
that the deceased would appear to have died of shock and hemorrhage
due to the injuries sustained on scalp and lungs.
xiv) Thereafter, he had issued requisition for the report in
respect of M.Os.6 and 7, which were recovered from the dead body
under the Special Report, Ex.P28.              Subsequently, on transfer of
service, PW18 had handed over the case records to his successor,
xv) The Inspector of Police, PW19, who took further investigation
of      the    case,  enquired   PW17-Jaganathan,     the  Scientific Officer,
Venkatesan, the Village Administrative Officer, Ammundi and Head
Constable Raja and recorded their statements.              On completion of
investigation, PW19 had filed final report for the offences punishable
under sections 302 and 352 IPC as against the appellant/accused.
4. Learned Judicial Magistrate, Katpadi has taken the case on file
in P.R.C.No.2 of 2012 under Sections 302, 352 IPC against the
appellant/accused and finding that the case is to be tried exclusively
by the Court of Sessions, after complying with the requirements under
Section 207 Cr.P.C., committed the case to the Principal District Court,
Vellore and in turn, it was made over to the Additional Sessions Judge
(Fast Track Court), Vellore in S.C.No.90 of 2017.
5. When the appellant/accused was confronted with the charges,
he denied the same, pleaded not guilty and sought to be tried.
6. During trial, the prosecution had examined 19 witnesses as
P.Ws.1 to 19, marked 29 documents as Exs.P1 to P29 and marked
M.Os.1 to 7. Though the appellant pleaded not guilty, no oral and
documentary evidence was let in on the side of the defence.
7.    On  completion   of  trial, the   Trial Court  found  the
appellant/accused guilty for the offences punishable under Section 302
and 352 IPC and sentenced him thereunder as indicated above.
8. Aggrieved against the judgment of conviction and sentence,
the present Appeal has been filed by the appellant/accused.
9. The sum and substances of the submissions made by the
Mr.T.Ravi, learned counsel appearing for the appellant is as under:-
i) The judgment of conviction and sentence rendered by the Trial
Court is against law as it failed to note that the eyewitnesses viz.,
P.Ws.1 to 3 turned hostile and the other vital witnesses viz., P.Ws.7 to
11 also turned hostile and there is no admissible evidence as against
the appellant to convict him and the prosecution has not established its
case beyond all reasonable doubts.
ii) The Trial Court has erred in relying upon the Statements of
the witnesses recorded under Section 164 Cr.P.C. to convict the
appellant when such statements were recorded on 6.10.2010 with
regard to the occurrence said to have taken place on 20.9.2010.
iii) When the law makes it clear that Statements recorded under
Section 164          Cr.P.C. can either be utilised only to corroborate or
contradict the witnesses vis-a-vis statement made in court and it
cannot be a substantive piece of evidence, the Trial Court has erred in
relying upon such statements to render the conviction against the
appellant, when especially the prosecution has not taken any steps to
contradict the witnesses who have turned hostile.
iv) The Trial Court has erred in ignoring the fact that P.Ws.5 and
6, arrest and recovery mahazar witnesses had also turned hostile and
therefore, the prosecution case with regard to arrest, confession and
recovery of material objects is also unbelievable.
v) The Trial Court has failed to note that no documents were
marked by the prosecution to establish the title of the deceased to the
house property and thereby the prosecution has failed to prove the
motive attributed to the appellant that he had demanded for transfer
of ownership in the name of his daughters and on refusal of the same
by the deceased, he had attacked her.
vi) The judgment of the Trial Court merely relying on the
statements of the witnesses recorded under Section 164 Cr.P.C. has
rendered the conviction against the appellant, which is inadmissible in
law and therefore, it is liable to be set aside.
10. Mr.Babu Muthumeeran, learned Additional Public Prosecutor
would submit that it is not a novel thing in criminal cases, and turning
of the prosecution witnesses hostile cannot be a ground for acquittal
of the accused.            He would further submit that the prosecution
witnesses had given a clear and cogent statement before the learned
Judicial Magistrate which is corroborated by the medical evidence viz.,
matching of blood group of the deceased with that of the blood stains
found on the dress of the appellant recovered on the basis of the
voluntary confession statement of the appellant and therefore, he
prays for dismissal of Criminal Appeal.
11. In reply, the learned counsel for the appellant would submit
that the witnesses for the recovery of weapon of offence have turned
hostile        and therefore, the recovery of the alleged cloths from the
appellant cannot be believed.           He would further submit that mere
matching of the blood group of the blood samples taken from the
victim and the blood stained cloths alleged to have been recovered
from the appellant/accused cannot lead to the conclusion that the
appellant/accused had been involved in the commission of crime in
question. In support of the same, he would rely upon the decision of
the Apex Court in Sonvir @ Somvir vs. State of NCT of Delhi
12. Heard the learned counsel appearing for the parties and
perused the materials available on record.
13. The appellant is alleged to have assaulted the deceased,
with whom, he was living together for about twenty years, enraged by
her action in lodging a complaint against him to the effect that he
gives torture to her demanding that the house property standing in her
name has to be transferred in the name of his children born through
his wife and the deceased had succumbed to the injuries she had
sustained.
14. It is a peculiar case where almost all the independent
prosecution witnesses including the witnesses to the arrest and seizure
of the weapon of offence produced by the prosecution have turned
hostile. The alleged author of Ex.P1 complaint, who is the niece of the
deceased, has also turned hostile.            Virtually, except the official
witnesses, no independent witness has supported the case of the
prosecution and the prosecution has not taken proper initiative to
prove its case.        However, the Trial Court has proceeded to rely upon
the statements recorded from such witnesses under Section 164
Cr.P.C. viz., Exs.P11 to P14          to render the conviction against the
15. The law is well settled that a statement recorded under
Section 164 of the Code of Criminal Procedure is not              substantive
evidence and it can be used to corroborate the statement of a witness
and it can be used to contradict a witness. In Ram Kishan Singh vs.
Harmit Kaur and another (1972) 3 SCC 280, it has been laid down
that a statement recorded under Section 164 of the Code of Criminal
Procedure is not            substantive evidence and it can be used to
corroborate the statement of a witness and it can be used to contradict
a witness.
16. In Baij Nath Sah vs. State of Bihar (2010) 6 SCC 736
also, the Apex Court has held that mere statement of the prosecutrix
recorded under Section 164 Cr.PC. is not enough to convict the
appellant and it is not substantive evidence and it can be utilised only
to corroborate or contradict the witness vis-a-vis statement made in
court.
17. In the case on hand, the Trial Court has held that though the
eyewitnesses to the occurrence had turned hostile during their
examination in court, their statements recorded under Section 164
Cr.P.C. corroborates the medical evidence viz., the wounds found on
the dead body as revealed in the post mortem certificate and thereby
found the appellant guilty.         However, strangely, the Trial Court has
ignored the fact that when the occurrence is said to have taken place
on 20.9.2010 and the post mortem certificate was issued on
21.9.2010, the statements from the witnesses had been recorded on
6.10.2010.          Such a long delay in recording the statements of the
witnesses speaks much.
18. Further, the Trial Court, taking presumption available under
Section 80 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872, had proceeded to rely
upon Exs.P11 to P14, the statements recorded from the witnesses
under Section 164 Cr.P.C. to render conviction against the appellant.
19. Of course, there a presumption is available under Section 80
of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 as to the documents produced as
record evidence. The legal provision reads as under:-
"80. Presumption as to documents produced as
record of evidence.—Whenever any document is
produced before any Court, purporting to be a record
or memorandum of the evidence, or of any part of
the evidence, given by a witness in a judicial
proceeding or before any officer authorized by law
to take such evidence, or to be a statement or
confession by any prisoner or accused person, taken
in accordance with law, and purporting to be signed
by any Judge or Magistrate, or by any such officer as
aforesaid,    the   Court shall  presume—    that the
document is genuine; that any statements as to the
circumstances under which it was taken, purporting
to be made by the person signing it, are true, and
that such evidence, statement or confession was duly
taken."
20. The question as to whether such presumption is applicable to
the statement (memorandum of identification proceedings) recorded
by a Magistrate under Section 164 Cr.P.C. has been elaborately dealt
with by a Three Judges Bench in              Sheo Raj vs. State (1963) SCC
OnLine All 123) and held that a statement made under Section 164,
Cr. P. C. is not 'evidence', is not made in a 'judicial proceeding' and is
not given under oath. It has been held therein as under:-
" .... it is open to any person to make a statement
or confession before a Magistrate (of a certain
class) in to course of an investigation, or at any
time thereafter, but before the commencement of
an enquiry or trial and the statement or confession
will be recorded by the Magistrate under Sec.164
and is not subject to the bar imposed by Sec. 162.
Such a statement, being a previous statement,
may be used only to contradict the person when he
appears as a witness at the enquiry or trial of the
offence or to corroborate him. A statement made
by a person before a Magistrate of the required
class  holding an    identification proceeding  and
recorded by him is a statement governed by Sec.
164; there is no dispute on this point. It is to be
noted   that   Sec.   164    simply mentions   “any
statement or confession made to him in the course
of an investigation” and not “any statement or
confession made to him in the course of an
investigation by any witness or accused person.” It
does not state whose statement of confession is to
be recorded by him Actually at this stage, when the
offence is still under investigation, there are no
witnesses and no accused persons (except in the
sense of persons against whom a charge of having
committed the offence is levelled and is under
investigation). It is only after the investigation has
been completed that the police can decide who is
to  be   the  accused     of   the offence   before  a
Magistrate and who are to be the witnesses in the
case. Till then there can be no decision about the
status of a person as an accused person or as a
witness and all persons examined by the police
during the investigation are mere interrogatories or
informants or statement-makers. The provisions in
the Code relating to investigation do not refer to
any person as a witness. Though “witness” is not
defined in the Evidence Act, Secs. 118, 119 and
120 of it make it clear that a witness is a person
who testifies before a court. Under section 59 all
facts may be proved by oral evidence and “oral
evidence” is defined in Sec. 3 to mean and include
all statements made by witnesses before a court.
The definition of “proved” shows that the question
of proof of a fact arises only before a court so long
as there is no court there is no question of a fact
being proved and consequently no question of oral
evidence and witnesses. Evidence can be given
only in respect of the existence or non-existence of
a fact in issue or a relevant fact, vide Sec. 5. Which
is a fact in issue or a relevant fact is a matter that
arises only before a court because only before a
court there can arise the question whether a
certain fact is proved or not. These provisions of
the Evidence Act make it clear that no person can
claim the status of a witness except in relation to a
proceeding before a court. It follows that while an
offence is still under investigation there is nobody
who can be called “witness” and there is no
statement that can be called “evidence.”
A Magistrate is certainly authorized by law to take
evidence but only in a case of which he has taken
cognizance; he is not authorised by law to take
evidence    in a   case   pending   before  another
Magistrate or in a case that has already been
decided by himself or another Magistrate or in a
case that has not yet reached a court. He is not
authorized by law to record evidence of any person
in  any   matter   and   in  any   circumstance.   A
Magistrate recording a statement under Sec. 164 is
not authorized by law to take evidence for the
simple reason that he is not charged with the fluty
(sic for "duty") of deciding any case and there is
no matter to be proved or disproved before him.
The other alternative is that the evidence must
have been given in a judicial proceeding. When a
Magistrate records a statement under Sec. 164
there are only two proceedings in which it can
possibly be said to have been recorded, (1) the
investigation by the police and (2) the proceeding
of recording the statement itself. The investigation
by the police is not a judicial proceeding. “Judicial
proceeding” is not defined in the Evidence Act, but
since we are concerned with a statement recorded
under the Code of Criminal Procedure the question
whether it was recorded in a judicial proceeding or
not must be decided in the light of the definition
given in the code. “Judicial proceeding” is defined
in Sec. 4(1)(m) to mean “any proceeding in the
course of which evidence is or may be legally taken
on oath.” If evidence may be legally taken on oath
it is enough even though evidence is actually not
taken on oath. An investigation is a judicial
proceeding only if it can be predicated that in the
course of it evidence may be legally taken on oath.
“In the course of which” means “in the carrying out
of which” or “in the conducting of which” and not
“during the pendency of which.” Anything that is
done    while    a  proceeding  is pending    is not
necessarily done in the course of it; if it is not a
part of it or is done by one not connected with it, it
is not done in the course of it even though it is
done during its pendency. In the course of an
investigation no evidence can be legally taken on
oath by anybody concerned in the investigation.
The police have no power to administer oath. As I
explained earlier, there is no question of evidence
being taken in the course of an investigation. If a
Magistrate does something while an investigation is
pending it is not done in the course of it. An
investigation  which   would   not   be  a   judicial
proceeding if a Magistrate did not do something
during its pendency does not become one simply
because he does something, such as recording a
statement under Sec. 164. Since an investigation is
to be done solely by the police nothing that he
does during its pendency becomes a part of it and
can be said to have been done in the course of it.
Consequently even if a Magistrate can legally
administer oath to a person before recording his
statement under Sec. 164 the investigation does
12. Thus I find that the statement made by a
person under Sec. 164 cannot be said to be made
in a judicial proceeding. Sec. 80, Evidence Act, is,
therefore, not applicable to it."
21. The principles laid down in the above decision make it clear
that presumption under Section 80 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872
cannot be drawn to rely upon the Statements of witnesses recorded
under Section 164 Cr.P.C during investigation to render a conviction.
22. Coming to the issue of bloodstains found in the shirt of the
appellant M.O.5, recovered at his instance, this court finds that the
witness to such recovery have also turned hostile, which, in turn,
makes the recovery itself unbelievable.          Of course, it is the case of the
prosecution that the shirt of the appellant was found to have stained
with human blood of “B” group, which was the same “blood group” as
that of the deceased.              However, it is relevant to note that mere
matching of blood group itself is not sufficient to convict the accused.
In Sonvir @ Somvir vs. State of NCT of Delhi (2018) 8 SCC 24, it
has been held as under:-
3. Alleged recovery of bloodstained shirt
As per the prosecution, a bloodstained shirt
was recovered at the instance of Sonvir alias Somvir
(Appellant-Accused 2) from his room in the house of
Teja Chaudhary, at the time of his arrest. The
bloodstained shirt was sent for analysis to the FSL. As
per the FSL report (Ext. PW 33/A), the shirt allegedly
recovered    from   Sonvir   alias Somvir   (Appellant-
Accused 2) was found to be stained with human
blood of “B” group, which was the same “blood
group” as that of the deceased.
In para 20, the High Court held the recovery of
the bloodstained shirt from Sonvir alias Somvir
(Appellant-Accused 2) to be incriminating against
him,   since   the  blood  samples    taken  from   the
bedsheet at the scene of crime, were also found to be
of the same blood group.
It is relevant to note that as per the FSL report
(Ext. PW 33/A), both the bloodstained shirt allegedly
recovered    from   Sonvir   alias Somvir   (Appellant-
Accused 2) and the blood samples taken from the
bedsheet at the scene of crime were found to be
stained with human blood of “B” group.
The mere matching of the blood group of the
blood samples taken from the bedsheet at the scene
of crime, and the bloodstained shirt recovered from
Sonvir alias Somvir (Appellant-Accused 2) cannot
lead to the conclusion that the appellant had been
involved in the commission of the crime.
On this issue, reliance can be placed on two
decisions of this Court in Prakash v. State of
Karnataka [Prakash v. State of Karnataka, (2014) 12
SCC 133 : (2014) 6 SCC (Cri) 642] , paras 41 and 45
and Debapriya Pal v. State of W.B. [Debapriya Pal v.
State of W.B., (2017) 11 SCC 31 : (2017) 3 SCC
(Cri) 832] , para 8 wherein this Court while deciding
cases based on circumstantial evidence had held that
mere matching of the blood group cannot lead to the
conclusion of the culpability of the accused, in the
absence of a detailed serological comparison, since
millions of people would have the same blood group.
In the present case, the prosecution has not
proved that the room from where the bloodstained
knife    and   bloodstained    shirt  were   allegedly
recovered, was in the exclusive possession of the
appellant. The prosecution case is that the said room
was in the house owned by one Teja Chaudhary. The
prosecution did not examine the said Teja Chaudhary
to prove that the said room was rented to Sonvir
alias Somvir and/or was in the exclusive custody of
the appellant.
Therefore, the recovery of the bloodstained
shirt from Sonvir alias Somvir (Appellant-Accused 2)
cannot    be  used   as  an   incriminating  piece  of
evidence."
23. In this case, as stated above, the eyewitnesses (including
the close relative of the deceased) and the recovery witnesses have
not supported the case of the prosecution.           Such being fatal to the
prosecution case, though there is medical evidence to the effect that
the bloodstains on the shirt of the appellant was found to belong "B"
group and it matched with the blood group of the deceased,             PW17,
Scientific Officer, during his cross examination, had admitted that in
Ex.P20 serology report, it has not been specifically mentioned as to
whether the blood group is 'B' positive or 'B' negative. Even assuming
that it matches completely, that alone cannot lead to a conclusion of
the culpability of the appellant/accused in the absence of a detailed
serological comparison and it cannot be used as an incriminating piece
of evidence as against the appellant, when especially, the recovery of
the shirt of the appellant is unbelievable in view of the fact that the
witness to the recovery had also turned hostile.
24. Therefore, this court is of the view that the prosecution has
not proved its case beyond all reasonable doubt and in such
circumstances, it may not be proper to convict the appellant/accused
on the materials available on record. However, the Trial court, having
misled itself into a specious reasoning that there is corroboration
between the statements of the witnesses recorded under Section 164
Cr.P.C and the medical evidence, had proceeded to render a conviction
against the appellant, which, we cannot endorse, in view of the law

sentence rendered by the Additional District and Sessions Judge, Fast
Track Court, Vellore made in S.C.No.90 of 2017 dated 11.9.2018 is set
aside and the appellant is acquitted of all the charges. The appellant is
set at liberty. Bail bond executed, if any, shall stand cancelled. Fine
amount paid, if any, shall be refunded to the appellant.
