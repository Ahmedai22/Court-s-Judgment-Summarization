has submitted that after thorough investigation, charge-sheet has

trial is on progress.
9.      It is clear from the above averment, petitioner is an accused in
that Case Crime No.286 of 2010 and charge-sheet has already been
filed. It is an accused, who has come up with a prayer for further
investigation. The right further is in the hands of the investigating
agency. The investigating agency has not come forward with any
prayer for further investigation. The object of this petition is only to
delay the pending proceedings.
                                      10.    Upon consideration the arguments raised by learned counsel for
                                      the petitioner and learned AGA, we are of the considered opinion that
                                      the right of further investigation under Section 173(8) Cr.P.C. is given
                                      to investigating agency, no other one except the investigating agency
                                      can thinks that further investigation is required for decision of the
                                      case, they can move application forwarded for further investigation
                                      under Section 173(8) Cr.P.C.
                                      11.    Since the trial is under progress, at this stage, neither the
                                      learned Magistrate suo motu nor on an application filed by the
                                      complainant/informant, can direct further investigation. Such a course
                                      would be open only on the request of the investigating agency, in
                                      circumstances warranting further investigation, on the detection of
                                      material evidence only to secure fair investigation and trial.
                                      12.    The facts of the case and perusal of material brought on record
                                      reveals that the investigation discloses the complicity of the petitioner
                                      in the crime. The accused cannot dictate the manner in which
                                      investigation is to be carried out, which is prerogative of the
                                      investigating agency alone. The investigating agency has filed a
                                      charge-sheet against the petitioner. The court below has taken
                                      cognizance and trial is under progress. No sufficient and valid reason
                                      exists for directing further investigation, prayed for.
                                      13.    The writ petition is accordingly, dismissed.
