The petitioners were appointed on various posts with the
respondent Bank No.3-Central Co-Operative Bank Ltd. During the
tenure of their services, the respondent Bank passed a resolution
dated 25.05.2010, whereby, the superannuation age of the
employees was reduced from 60 years to 58 years. The said
resolution was challenged in S.B. Civil Writ Petition No.
5332/2010, which was decided on 05.07.2011 and the
respondent Bank was directed to reconsider the age of retirement
and also to continue with the services of the employees. In
pursuance to the directions of this Court, the respondent Bank
reconsidered the issue but again took a resolution to fix the age of
superannuation at 58 years. As a consequence, the petitioners
stood retired.
The resolution dated 18.07.2011 was again challenged and
vide interim order dated 06.09.2011, the effect and operation of
the resolution was stayed. In consequence thereof, the petitioners
were allowed to resume their duties.
During the pendency of the writ petitions, the Bank again
took a resolution to increase the age of superannuation from 58
years to 60 years. The statement to that effect was made before
the Court on behalf of the respondent Bank and in view of the
submission made, the petitions of the petitioners were dismissed
as having become infructuous.
Meanwhile, the petitioners after completing the age of 60
years, superannuated.
The grievance in the present writ petition of the petitioners is
that they were not paid the salary of the period during which they
remained out of service because of the resolutions being passed
by the Bank.
The period during which the petitioners remained out of

Learned counsel for the petitioners has averred that it was
only on the basis of the submission made by the Bank that the
earlier writ petition was rendered as infructuous as the Bank had
promised the consequential benefits also in pursuance to the
Learned counsel for the petitioner has relied upon the
judgment passed in Civil Appeal No. 5527/2012 ; State of
Uttar Pradesh v. Dayanand Chakrawarty & Ors. He has
submitted that the employees had remained out of service only
because of the wrong decision taken by the Bank and not because
of any fault on their part.
Learned counsel has stated that even while passing the
interim order dated 06.09.2011 in the earlier writ petition (S.B.
Civil Writ Petition No. 7263/2011), the issue pertaining to the
arrears was kept pending by the Court for decision at the time of
final hearing. But because of the petition being dismissed as
infructuous, the same could not be decided at that stage.
Learned counsel further submitted that two employees
namely Kailash Chandra Shotriya and Harish Chandra Joshi have
been paid the arrears of salary of the disputed period by the Bank
and the present petitioners have been denied the same without
any plausible reason.
Learned counsel for the respondent Bank has submitted that
as the petitioners had not worked during the period as alleged,
they were not entitled to the salary for that period on the principle
of ‘no pay no work’.
Learned counsel did not dispute the fact of the other two
employees as named by the petitioners being paid the salary but
submitted that the same was on medical grounds.
Heard learned counsel for the parties and have perused the
material available on record.
It is clear on record that the respondent Bank had passed
the resolutions dated 25.05.2010 & 18.07.2011 without any logic
or reason, which were interfered in by this Court and ultimately
the resolution dated 16.12.2013 was passed by the Bank in the
interest of the Bank only. The said resolution dated 16.12.2013
was passed with the clear understanding that the benefits of that
decision are to be granted to even those employees who had
retired by that time.
The relevant portion of the resolution dated 16.12.2013

The    Hon’ble       Apex    Court    in   the   case    of    Dayanand
Chakrawarty (supra), while relying upon earlier judgments passed
in Harwindra Kumar reported in 2005(13) SCC 300, Radhey
Shyam Gautam reported in 2007(11) SCC 507 and Jaswant
Singh reported in 2006(11) SCC 464 observed as under:]
“We observe that the principle of ‘no pay no
work’ is not applicable to the employees who were
guided by specific rules like Leave Rules etc. relating
to absence from duty. Such principle can be applied to
only those employees who were not guided by any
specific rule relating to absence from duty. If an
employee        is   prevented      by    the   employer      from
performing his duties, the employee cannot be blamed
for having not worked, and the principle of ‘no
pay no work’ shall not be applicable to such employee.
38. In these cases as we have already held that
Regulation 31 shall be applicable and the age of
superannuation of employees of the Nigam shall be 60
years; we are of the view that following consequential
and pecuniary benefits should be allowed to different
sets of employees who were ordered to retire at the
(a) The employees including respondents
who moved before a court of law irrespective of
fact whether interim order was passed in their
favour or not, shall be entitled for full salary up to
the age of 60 years. The arrears of salary shall be
paid to them after adjusting the amount if any
paid.”
In view of the ratio as laid down by the Hon’ble Apex Court
in Dayanand Chakrawarty’s case (supra), it is held that the
present petitioners would be entitled for the salary for the period
during which they remained out of service. The same shall be paid
to them within a period of three months from the date of receipt
of the copy of this order. If the same is not paid within the said
period, it would then be payable along with an interest at the rate
of 6% per annum.
With these observations, the present writ petitions are
