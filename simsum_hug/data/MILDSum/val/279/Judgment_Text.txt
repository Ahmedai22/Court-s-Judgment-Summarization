On the last date of hearing, I had directed the petitioner to file a copy
of the order of the High Court of Punjab and Haryana at Chandigarh in the
present matter.
The order has been filed which shows that the Ms. „A‟ i.e., the
daughter of the complainant had approached the High Court of Punjab and
Haryana stating that she had married the applicant out of her own will and
that her parents were threatening to cause harm to her and her husband. As a
result of which, the High Court of Punjab and Haryana was pleased to direct
the respondent Police to provide adequate and appropriate protection to Ms.
„A‟ and her husband.
In the present case, the FIR has been filed by the father of Ms. „A‟
stating that his daughter aged about 17 years was married on 30.06.2021 to
one,                    . On 27.10.2021, Ms A came to the house of the
Applicant and on 28.10.2021, Applicant took Ms. „A‟ to Punjab and
performed marriage with her. Hence the FIR.
In my opinion the intention of POCSO was to protect children below
the age of 18 years from sexual exploitation. It was never meant to
criminalize consensual romantic relationships between young adults.
However, this has to be seen from facts and circumstances of each case.
There might be cases where the survivor of sexual offence, may under
pressure or trauma be forced to settle.
The    Madras     High    Court   in  Crl.O.P.No.232      of 2021    and
Crl.M.P.No.109 of 2021 titled Vijayalakshmi vs State, has also observed that
“11. There can be no second thought as to the seriousness of
offences under the POCSO Act and the object it seeks to achieve.
However, it is also imperative for this Court to draw the thin line
that demarcates the nature of acts that should not be made to fall
within the scope of the Act, for such is the severity of the sentences
provided under the Act, justifiably so, that if acted upon hastily or
irresponsibly, it could lead to irreparable damage to the reputation
and livelihood of youth whose actions would have been only
innocuous. What came to be a law to protect and render justice to
victims and survivors of child abuse, can, become a tool in the
hands of certain sections of the society to abuse the process of
This Court in Dharmender Singh v. State (Govt. of NCT) BAIL APPL.
1559/2020, granted bail to the accused while taking into consideration the
possibility of a reciprocal physical relationship between the accused and the
minor victim. It has also laid down the parameters that are to be followed
when considering bail of a person accused under the POCSO Act, it has held
77. Though the heinousness of the offence alleged will beget
the length of sentence after trial, in order to give due weightage to
the intent and purpose of the Legislature in engrafting section 29
in this special statute to protect children from sexual offences,
while deciding a bail plea at the post-charge stage, in addition to
the nature and quality of the evidence before it, the court would
also factor in certain real life considerations, illustrated below,
which would tilt the balance against or in favour of the accused :
a. the age of the minor victim : the younger the victim, the
more heinous the offence alleged;
b. the age of the accused : the older the accused, the more
heinous the offence alleged;
c. the comparative age of the victim and the accused : the
more their age difference, the more the element of perversion in
the offence alleged;
d. the familial relationship, if any, between the victim and
the accused : the closer such relationship, the more odious the
e. whether the offence alleged involved threat, intimidation,
violence and/or brutality;
f. the conduct of the accused after the offence, as alleged;
g. whether the offence was repeated against the victim; or
whether the accused is a repeat offender under the POCSO Act or
h. whether the victim and the accused are so placed that the
accused would have easy access to the victim, if enlarged on bail :
the more the access, greater the reservation in granting bail;
i. the comparative social standing of the victim and the
accused : this would give insight into whether the accused is in a
dominating position to subvert the trial;
j. whether the offence alleged was perpetrated when the
victim and the accused were at an age of innocence : an innocent,
though unholy, physical alliance may be looked at with less
k. whether it appears there was tacit approval-in-fact,
though not consent-in-law, for the offence alleged;
l. whether the offence alleged was committed alone or along
with other persons, acting in a group or otherwise;
m. other similar real-life considerations.
The above factors are some cardinal considerations, though
far from exhaustive, that would guide the court in assessing the
egregiousness of the offence alleged; and in deciding which way
the balance would tilt. At the end of the day however, considering
the myriad facets and nuances of real-life situations, it is
impossible to cast in stone all considerations for grant or refusal
of bail in light of section 29. The grant or denial of bail will
remain, as always, in the subjective satisfaction of a court; except
that in view of section 29, when a bail plea is being considered
after charges have been framed, the above additional factors
should be considered.”
In the present case, I have interacted with Ms. „A‟ in the Chamber in
the presence of learned APP.
She states that she was married to one, Mr.           but she does not
wish to stay with him. At the time of marriage with the applicant on
28.10.2021, she was an adolescent and around 17 years of age (her date of
birth is 01.10.2004).
She further states that she got married to the applicant out of her own
free will and without any undue influence, threat, pressure or coercion and
even today wants to stay with the applicant.
Thus, this is not a case where the girl was coerced into the
relationship with the boy. In fact, Ms. „A‟, herself went to the applicant‟s
house and asked him to marry her. The statement of the victim makes it
clear that this is a romantic relationship between the two and that the sexual
act involved between them was consensual. Although the victim is minor
and hence her consent does not have any legal bearing, I am of the opinion
that the factum of a consensual relationship borne out of love should be of
consideration while granting bail. To ignore the statement of the victim and
let the accused suffer behind jail, in the present case, would otherwise
amount to perversity of justice.
I am cognizant of the fact that the proceedings before me are of grant
of bail and not of quashing of FIR. It is not a case where the slate of
applicant is wiped clear. In the circumstances of the present case, the
applicant is entitled to bail for the reasons enumerated above.
In this view of the matter, applicant shall be released on bail on the
following terms and conditions:-
i.   The applicant shall furnish a personal bond and surety bond in the
sum of Rs. 10,000/- each, to the satisfaction of the Jail
ii.   The applicant shall appear before the Court as and when the matter
is taken up for hearing;
iii.   The applicant shall join investigation as and when called by the I.O
iv.    The applicant shall provide his mobile number to the Investigating
Officer (IO) concerned, which shall be kept in working condition
at all times. The applicant shall not switch off, or change the same
without prior intimation to the IO concerned, during the period of
v.  In case the applicant changes his address, he will inform the IO
concerned and this Court also;
vi.  The applicant shall not leave the country during the bail period and
surrender his passport, if any, at the time of release before the Jail
vii.  The applicant shall not indulge in any criminal activity during the
The application stands disposed of in the aforesaid terms.
