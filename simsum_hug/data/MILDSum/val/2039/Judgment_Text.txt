1.     This is a petition filed seeking setting aside of the orders dated
26.07.2021, 15.09.2021 and 18.10.2021 passed by the learned Metropolitan
Magistrate, Mahila Court-02, South East, Saket District Court, Delhi in CT
titled                                      qua car bearing
2.     The present petition has its genesis in a matrimonial dispute between
respondent No. 2 and respondent No. 3 who are wife and husband
respectively. Admittedly, petitioner is a company of which 75% shares were
Digitally Signed byAMIT CRL.M.C. 2872/2022                                                 Page 1 of 16
held by respondent No.3. The petitioner company is engaged in business of
construction, real estate. The petitioner is the registered owner of car bearing
registration No.                       make Audi Q7 (hereinafter referred to as
„Audi car‟). As per the petition, the company had given the said car to
respondent No. 3 for his official use and was being used by respondent
3.      It is further stated that the said car was returned by respondent No.3 to
petitioner at the time of his resignation, i.e 02.07.2021. On 19.07.2021,
respondent No. 2 took the car from the possession of the petitioner having
original title documents of 24 properties of the clients of the petitioner.
Since the petitioner was not aware of the whereabouts of the Audi car, the
petitioner filed a complaint at Sector 49, Noida Police Station with respect to
the theft of the Audi car.
4.      On 01.08.2021, FIR No. 861/2021 was registered at Sector 49, Noida
Police Station, under Section 379 IPC qua theft of the Audi car and original
title documents of the 24 properties.
5.      In the meanwhile, respondent No. 2 initiated proceedings under
Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act against respondent No. 3
before learned MM, Mahila Court-02, South East, Saket District Court,
6.      The petitioner was informed subsequently that the car is in the power
and possession of respondent No. 2 and her possession is protected by the
order of learned MM Mahila Court.
7.      On 26.07.2021, respondent No. 2 and respondent No. 3 were referred
to mediation. On the said date, the counsel for the respondent No.3 had
made a statement that the Audi car must be returned by the respondent No. 2
Digitally Signed byAMIT CRL.M.C. 2872/2022                                                   Page 2 of 16
and in place the respondent No. 3 would provide respondent No. 2 a BMW
car. However, the learned counsel for the respondent No. 3 later retracted
from the said statement regarding providing of a BMW car.
8.     On 15.09.2021, the learned MM Court directed that the said Audi car
will remain in power and possession of the respondent No. 2 till the matter is
heard on merits. On 18.10.2021, the application filed by petitioner company
seeking review of the order dated 15.09.2021 was dismissed. The learned
MM Court was of the view that there is no power of review under Protection
of Women from Domestic Violence Act. In addition, the learned MM Court
was of the view that assuming that the powers of Section 25 (2) of the
Domestic Violence Act permitted alteration/modification of the order, the
petitioner, i.e. the intervener before the learned MM Court had no locus
standi to move the application as it was neither an aggrieved person within
the meaning of the Act nor the respondent. Lastly, the learned MM Court
was of view that the respondent No. 3 was a Director of the petitioner
company with 75% shares. The respondent No. 3 resigned from petitioner
company only after the order of 26.07.2021 had been passed. Hence, the
learned MM dismissed the application filed on 04.10.2021 moved by the
petitioner company for return of the Audi car.
9.     Mr Vachher, learned counsel for petitioner states that the petitioner
company is suffering at the hands of the husband and wife i.e respondent
No. 3 and respondent No. 2 without any fault of the petitioner company. He
further states that in addition to the loss of car, there are original property
papers also lying were in the car and one Mr A.C. Juneja has initiated
criminal proceedings against the petitioner in this regard. He further submits
that petitioner being the registered owner of the Audi car, cannot be
Digitally Signed byAMIT CRL.M.C. 2872/2022                                                 Page 3 of 16
deprived of its assets on account of matrimonial disputes between
Respondents 2 and 3.
10.    Mr. Vachher has also relied upon Section 29 of Prevention of Women
from Domestic Violence Act to state that since the petitioner is neither the
respondent nor an aggrieved person in the present case, he cannot maintain
an appeal under section 29 of the said act.
11.    Mr Jauhar, learned counsel appearing for respondent No. 2 states that
the present petition is a proxy litigation by respondent No. 3, i.e. the
husband. He further states that the petitioner has already submitted to the
jurisdiction of the learned MM Court and has already filed an application for
recall of the order dated 15.09.2021. Once petitioner has submitted to the
jurisdiction, the present petition is not maintainable as all the orders i.e.
orders dated 26.07.2021, 15.09.2021 and 18.10.2021 are intermediate
orders. He further submits that the respondent No. 3 on 26.07.2021 made a
statement to the Court that he would provide the respondent No. 2 with a
BMW car in place of the Audi car and on that statement, respondent No. 2
was agreeable. Respondent No. 2 even today is agreeable to return the Audi
car, provided a BMW car is provided to respondent No. 2. Lastly, he
submits that the respondent No. 3 resigned from the petitioner company only
to play mischief with the Court and to deprive respondent No. 2 of the
benefits of orders dated 26.07.2021, 15.09.2021 and 18.10.2021. The
respondent No. 3 was a 75% shareholder of the petitioner company and a
Director and he resigned from Directorship only after passing of the orders.
12.    I have heard learned counsel for the parties.
13.    In present case, the first question which arises for my determination is
whether the present petition is maintainable against orders passed by the
Digitally Signed byAMIT CRL.M.C. 2872/2022                                                Page 4 of 16
learned MM under Section 12 of the Domestic Violence Act. It was stated
by Mr. Jauhar that the petitioner should have filed an appeal under Section
29 of the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act. I am unable to
agree. The petitioner in the present case is neither a respondent nor an
aggrieved person. As per section 2(a) of the Protection of Women from
Domestic Violence Act, an “aggrieved person” means any woman who is,
or has been, in a domestic relationship with the respondent and who alleges
to have been subjected to any act of domestic violence by the respondent. On
the other hand, section 2(q) of the Act defines a “respondent” as any adult
male person who is, or has been, in a domestic relationship with the
aggrieved person and against whom the aggrieved person has sought any
relief under this Act. The petitioner in the present case is a company of
which respondent No. 3 was a Director and 75 % shareholder. The
judgement of Chaitanya Singhania and Masood Khan is applicable to the
facts of the present case. In „Chaitanya Singhania and Another v.
Khushboo Singhania‟ (2021 SCC OnLine Cal 2602) on 27.09.2021, it was
“47. Similarly, there is no bar in invoking Section 482 in the
cases under Protection of Women against Domestic Violence
Act, 2005. In Suresh Ahirwar vs. Priya Ahirwar [M. Cr. C
No.22777/2017], vide order dated 11th November, 2018, the
Madhya    Pradesh High       Court   quashed   a   proceeding
under Section 482 of the Code where aggrieved person
impleaded some persons as respondents in a proceeding
under Section 12 of the said Act with whom she had no
domestic relationship.
Digitally Signed byAMIT CRL.M.C. 2872/2022                                               Page 5 of 16
48. This being the interpretation of the statute, a court of the
Judicial Magistrate or the Metropolitan Magistrate cannot
pass any order in a proceeding under Section 125 of the Code
or under the provision of Protection of Women against
Domestic Violence where there is no relation or domestic
relation exists between the parties. For example, an order of
maintenance cannot be passed against a stranger. Similarly,
an order of residence under Section 19 of the said Act cannot
be passed against a landlord under the instance of an
aggrieved person. Even a residence order cannot be passed
against the father-in-law of the aggrieved person if the
residence is not a shared household of the respondent along
with his father (See Satish Chander Ahuja Vs. Sneha Ahuja
reported in (2021) 1 SCC 414). If such application is filed by
an aggrieved person, will it be a logical proposition that the
respondent will not be able to nip the proceedings in bud
without waiting for a prolonged trial or otherwise wait for a
considerable period till the disposal of trial? My considered
reply is - such questions affecting the maintainability of the
procedure itself can be decided by this Court under Section
482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.”
14.    Furthermore, in „Masood Khan v. Millie Hazarika‟ (2021 SCC
OnLine Megh 58) on 04.03.2021, it was observed as under-
“35. The applicability of the said provision of Section 28 of the
said DV Act in criminal proceedings was emphasized by the
Digitally Signed byAMIT CRL.M.C. 2872/2022                                                 Page 6 of 16
Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Satish Chander Ahuja
(supra) at paragraphs 138 and 139 where it has restated that
the procedure to be followed shall be under the Code of
36. The learned counsel for the Respondent No. 2 has
submitted that the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the said case of
Satish Chander Ahuja (supra) at paragraph 146 of the same
has pointed out that only Section 19 of the DV Act, 2005 has
been singled out for consideration and exposition to examine
the conflict between orders passed in a criminal proceeding on
a civil proceeding and as such, it is maintained that the
observation of the Court at paragraphs 138 and 139 are
limited to this extent.
37. This Court is not in agreement with the submission of the
learned counsel for the Respondent No. 2 on the observation of
the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the said case of Satish Chander
Ahuja (supra) to say that it is limited, when it is clearly seen
that the Hon'ble Supreme Court has clearly spelt out
its position on the nature of proceedings under the DV Act,
2005 being governed by the procedure under the Code of
Criminal Procedure which is only a reiteration of the stated
provision of Section 28 and as such, the relief or remedy may
be civil in nature, but the procedure to be followed under
the DV Act, particularly for proceedings under Sections
12, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22 and 23 as well as under Section 31 has
Digitally Signed byAMIT CRL.M.C. 2872/2022                                                 Page 7 of 16
to be governed by the provisions of the Code of Criminal
Procedure. Even reference to paragraph 146 would also show
that Section 19 of the DV Act which is under consideration, is
one of the section indicated above to be governed by the
procedure of Code of Criminal Procedure.
38. It is also a fact that Section 482 Cr.P.C provides for
inherent power on the High Court to make such order as may
be necessary to give effect to any order under the Code and as
stated above, proceedings under the DV Act being governed by
the procedure under the Cr.P.C, therefore the logical
conclusion would be that an application under Section 482 is
maintainable       qua     order      passed     under Sections
12, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22 and 23 of the DV Act.
39. With due respect, the decisions of the Hon'ble Kerala High
Court and the Madras High Court cited above and relied upon
by the learned Counsel for the Respondent No 2, as far as the
procedural aspects under the DV Act is concerned, would not
stand the test in the light of the decision of the Hon'ble
Supreme Court in the case of Satish Chander Ahuja (supra).
40. Consequently, this Court finds that this instant petition
under Section 482 Cr.PC is maintainable. The submission and
contention of the parties on the issue of consideration of
converting this instant petition into one under Article 227 and
the authorities referred thereto would therefore not require
Digitally Signed byAMIT CRL.M.C. 2872/2022                                                Page 8 of 16
any decision or observation by this Court under the
circumstances.”
15.    Hence, for the reasons stated above and relying on the judgments, I
am of the view that the petitioner company is not a respondent and the
respondent No. 2 is not an aggrieved person within the meaning of
Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act vis-à-vis each other and
hence the petitioner cannot be relegated to filing an appeal under section 29
of Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act.
16.    Coming to the second limb of the argument, whether the learned MM
could have passed an order permitting the respondent No. 2 to retain the
control of the said Audi car? The Audi car belongs to the petitioner company
and the RC bearing No.                 is not in dispute. As already held, it is
not the petitioner company which is in a domestic relationship with
respondent No. 2. At best, the car was given to respondent No. 3 maybe as a
75% shareholder or as a Director of petitioner company, as a benefit. The
respondent No.2 under Section 12 of the Domestic Violence Act can only
have a grievance against the respondent No. 3 with whom she was in a
domestic relationship. Section 19 and 22 of the Act entitles the respondent
No. 2 with right of residence as well as relief of compensation and damages
against the respondent who has been defined under Section 2(q). The
petitioner company does not come within the ambit of the said definition.
The lifting of corporate veil and to hold that the Audi car even though
belongs to petitioner company but in fact belongs to respondent No. 3,
would not be legally tenable. The company and its shareholders and
Directors are separate legal entities.

17.    The Supreme Court in „Abhilash Vinodkumar Jain v. Cox & Kings
(India) Ltd.’ [(1995) 3 SCC 732] has held that-
“18. Section 630 of the Act provides speedy relief to the
company where its property is wrongfully obtained or
wrongfully withheld by an "employee or an officer" or a "past
employee or an officer" or "legal heirs and representatives"
deriving their colour and content from such an employee or
officer" in so far as the occupation and possession of the
property belonging to the company is concerned. The failure
to deliver property back to the employer on the termination,
resignation, superannuation or death of an employee, would
render the "holding" of that property wrongful and actionable
under Section 630 of the Act. To hold that the "legal heirs"
would not be covered by the provisions of Section 630 of the
Act would be unrealistic and illogical. It would defeat the
"beneficent" provision and ignore the factual realities that the
legal heirs or family members who are continuing in
possession of the allotted property, had obtained the right of
occupancy with the employee concerned in the property of the
employer only by virtue of their relationship with the
employee/officer and had not obtained or acquired the right to
possession of the property in any other capacity, status or
right. The legislature, which is supposed to know and
appreciate the needs of the people, by enacting Section 630 of
the Act manifested that it was conscious of the position that
today in the corporate sector - private or public enterprise -
Digitally Signed byAMIT CRL.M.C. 2872/2022                                                Page 10 of 16
the employees officers are often provided residential
accommodation by employer for the 'use and occupation' of
the concerned employee during the course of his employment.
More often than not, it is a part of the service conditions of the
employee that the employer shall provide him residential
accommodation during the course of his employment. If an
employee or a past employee or anyone claiming the right of
occupancy under them, were to continue to 'hold' the property
belonging to the company, after the right to be in occupation
has ceased for one reason or the other, it would not only
create difficulties for the company, which shall not be able to
allot that property to its other employees, but would also cause
hardship for the employee awaiting allotment and defeat the
intention of the legislature.”
18.    The Hon‟ble Supreme Court in „Life Insurance Corporation of India
v Escorts Ltd & Ors.’ [1986] 1 SCC 264] on 19.12.1985 had observed that-
“90. … Generally and broadly speaking, we may say that the
corporate veil may be lifted where a statute itself contemplates
lifting the veil, or fraud or improper conduct is intended to be
prevented or a taxing statute or a beneficent statute is sought to
be evaded or where associated companies are inextricably
connected as to be in reality, part of one concern.”
19.    Further, the Hon‟ble Supreme Court in „P.C. Agarwala v. Payment of
Wages Inspector, M.P’ [(2005) 8 SCC 104] in the year 2005 has cited with
Digitally Signed byAMIT CRL.M.C. 2872/2022                                                  Page 11 of 16
approval the law laid down in “Salomon v. Salomon & Co”, holding that a
company is a separate legal entity and the corporate veil is to be lifted only
in exceptional circumstances and cases like serious fraud. It has opined that-
“21. In TELCO v. State of Bihar [(1964) 6 SCR 885 : AIR 1965 SC
40] the basic features of a company, its corporate existence and its
position vis-á-vis shareholders was highlighted as follows: (SCR pp.
“The true legal position in regard to the character of
a corporation or a company which owes its incorporation
to a statutory authority, is not in doubt or dispute. The
corporation in law is equal to a natural person and has a
legal entity of its own. The entity of the corporation is
entirely separate from that of its shareholders; it bears its
own name and has a seal of its own; its assets are
separate and distinct from those of its members; it can
sue and be sued exclusively for its own purpose; its
creditors cannot obtain satisfaction from the assets of its
members; the liability of the members or shareholders is
limited to the capital invested by them; similarly, the
creditors of the members have no right to the assets of the
corporation. This position has been well established ever
since the decision in the case of Salomon v. Salomon &
Co. [1897 AC 22 : (1895-99) All ER Rep 33 (HL)] was
pronounced in 1897; and indeed, it has always been the
well-recognised principle of common law. However, in
Digitally Signed byAMIT CRL.M.C. 2872/2022                                                  Page 12 of 16
the course of time, the doctrine that the corporation or a
company has a legal and separate entity of its own has
been subjected to certain exceptions by the application of
the fiction that the veil of the corporation can be lifted
and its face examined in substance. The doctrine of the
lifting of the veil thus marks a change in the attitude that
law had originally adopted towards the concept of the
separate entity or personality of the corporation. As a
result of the impact of the complexity of economic factors,
judicial decisions have sometimes recognised exceptions
to the rule about the juristic personality of the
corporation. It may be that in course of time these
exceptions may grow in number and to meet the
requirements of different economic problems, the theory
about the personality of the corporation may be confined
more and more.”
23. Gower has similarly summarised this position with an
observation that in a number of important respects, the legislature
has rent the veil woven by Salomon case [1897 AC 22 : (1895-99)
All ER Rep 33 (HL)] . Particularly this is so, says Gower, in the
sphere of taxation and in the steps which have been taken towards
the recognition of the enterprise entity rather than corporate entity.
It is significant, however, that according to Gower the courts have
only construed the statutes as “cracking open the corporate shell”
when compelled to do so by the clear words of the statute—indeed
Digitally Signed byAMIT CRL.M.C. 2872/2022                                                 Page 13 of 16
they have gone out of their way to avoid this construction whenever
possible. Thus, at present the judicial approach in cracking open
the corporate shell is somewhat cautious and circumspect. It is only
when the legislative provision justifies the adoption of such a
course that the veil has been lifted. In exceptional cases where the
courts have felt “themselves able to ignore the corporate entity and
to treat the individual shareholder as liable for its acts” the same
course has been adopted. Summarising his conclusions, Gower has
classified seven categories of cases where the veil of corporate
body has been lifted. But it would not be possible to evolve a
rational, consistent and inflexible principle which can be invoked in
determining the question as to whether the veil of the corporation
should be lifted or not. Broadly, where fraud is intended to be
prevented, or trading with the enemy is sought to be defeated, the
veil of the corporation is lifted by judicial decision and the
shareholders are held to be “persons who actually work for the
corporation.”
20.    In the present case which is a matrimonial dispute, the corporate veil
cannot be permitted to be lifted to hold that the Audi car bearing registration
No.                  even though belongs to the petitioner company, must be
held to be belonging to and owned by respondent No. 3. The respondent
No.3 was a director of the petitioner company and a 75% shareholder. There
is another shareholder who owns 25% of the shareholding and there are
other directors of the petitioner company.
Digitally Signed byAMIT CRL.M.C. 2872/2022                                                Page 14 of 16
21.    The learned counsel for respondent No. 2 has tried to emphasise that
respondent No. 3 has been showing incorrect dates of resignation. He states
that respondent No. 3 has fraudulently shown his date of resignation as a
director from the petitioner company on 02.07.2021, when in fact he had
resigned from the petitioner company on 04.08.2021, i.e, only after passing
of the consent order dated 26.07.2021. The same is irrelevant for purpose of
adjudication as the proceedings which have been enumerated hereinabove
cannot be brought within the ambit of the phrase “fraud”. Black‟s Law
Dictionary has defined fraud as “A knowing misrepresentation of the truth or
concealment of a material fact to induce another to act to his or her
detriment”. The act and conduct of the respondent No. 3 does not come
within the said definition of fraud. The respondent No. 3 is entitled to resign
as a director from the petitioner company as and when he desires. The law
permits him to do so. Once the respondent No. 3 has done a legally
permissible act, the same cannot be considered a fraud in any way. Hence,
there cannot be a declaration to hold that the said Audi Car belongs not the
petitioner company but to the respondent No. 3.
22.    For the aforesaid reasons, I am inclined to allow the petition. The
orders dated 26.07.2021, 15.09.2021 and 18.10.2021 as far as permitting
respondent No. 2 to retain the Audi car are set aside and Audi car bearing
registration No.                 must be returned to the petitioner company
within one week of passing of this order. However, this order is only for the
return of the Audi car and in no way determines the right of respondent No.
2 to seek maintenance, right of residence commensurate with her stature and
her living lifestyle, from respondent No. 3. She shall be at liberty to initiate
any/all such proceedings for getting a car/maintenance for herself and her

children which if already filed or which may be filed in future, shall be
determined in accordance with law.
23.    With these observations, the petition is allowed.
