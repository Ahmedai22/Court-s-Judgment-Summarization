persons at Railway Station- Raipur, DRI further searched the house of

was put to challenge by the petitioner before this Court by way of filing writ
petition bearing WPC No.5388 of 2021, which was finally decided vide order
dated 02.03.2022 whereby the notice under Section 110 (2) of the Customs
Act, 1962 (for short “the Act of 1962”) for extending the time for investigation
was quashed and subsequent notices/summons issued to the petitioner
therein have been held to be without any authority of law. It is further
contended that in terms of Section 110 (2) of the Act of 1962, if proceedings
have not been concluded within prescribed period, the investigation agency
have to mandatorily return back the goods which were taken into possession
from the petitioner but that was not done till date. Order dated 02.03.2022
passed by the learned Single Judge was put to challenge by respondent-
Department along with the application for grant of interim relief but till date, no
interim relief has been granted in their favour and the order dated 02.03.2022
is still in existence and force. It is contended that after passing of order dated
02.03.2022, as on the date, proceedings of search and seizure was quashed,
no further proceedings under under Section 124 of the Act of 1962 which is
the proceedings for confiscation of good seized can be initiated. He submits
that pending consideration of this writ petition, awaiting reply of respondents,
further proceedings pursuant to the notice under Section 124 of the Act of
1962 may be stayed.
Shri Ramakant Mishra, learned ASG for the respondents would submit
that though there is order in favour of petitioner in WPC No.5388 of 2021 but
the said order is under challenge before the Division Bench in Writ Appeal
No.211 of 2022 and is pending consideration. Hence, proceedings have not
attained finality. He also contended that the amendment has been brought
into the Act of 1962 by virtue of Notification dated 31.03.2022 and in that
amended provision, there is no mention of Proper Officer and the amendment
has been made applicable with retrospective effect. Hence the interim relief
as sought for by the petitioner may not be granted at this stage.

taking into consideration the submission made by learned counsel for the
petitioner based on order dated 02.03.2022 passed by the High Court in WPC
No.5388 of 2021 whereby the notice under Section 110 (2) of the Act of 1962
was held to be without any authority of law, the notice was quashed, it is
directed that respondents shall not proceed any further pursuant to notice
