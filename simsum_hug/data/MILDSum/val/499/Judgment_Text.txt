In this appeal the appellant has challenged the
judgment        dated     03.03.2014       passed       in
M.V.C.No.1847/2010 by the Principal Senior Civil
(Hereinafter referred to as â€˜Tribunal' for short).
2. The appellant-insurance company was the
second respondent, respondent Nos.1 and 2 were
the petitioners, and respondent No.3 was respondent
No.1 before the Tribunal. The parties will be referred
with respect to their status before the Tribunal for
the sake of convenience.
3. Briefly stated, the facts are that, one Ravi,
the deceased, was the son of the first petitioner and
brother of second petitioner. They were the residents
of Mudigere Taluk. The deceased was suffering from
Jaundice. On 13.04.2010, for higher treatment, he
was carried in an Ambulance bearing No.KA-13/M-
0472 from Chikmagalur to Mangalore. At about 2.30
a.m., at Kodekkal Railway over bridge, Alape village
it was driven by its driver in a rash and negligent
manner    and   toppled,   causing   injures  to    the
deceased. He was succumbed to the injuries at
4. The petitioners moved the Tribunal seeking
compensation that the deceased died on account of
the  accident.  The   claim   was  opposed    by    the
respondents on the ground that there is no nexus
between the accident and death of the deceased.
The Tribunal considering     the   evidence   awarded
compensation of Rs.5,50,000/- with interest @ 6%.
5. The Insurance Company is before this court
on the ground that there was no nexus between the
accident and death of the deceased. FSL report has
suggested     that the   death  was    due   to   lobor
Pneumonia and Tuberculosis with mild steatosis of
liver, and it was not on account of the accident. The
Tribunal ought to have rejected the claim and also
urged that the income taken and assessment of
dependency was on higher side.
6. Heard Smt.H.R.Renuka, learned counsel for
the insurer and Sri.P.Karunakar, learned counsel for
the petitioner No.2. Respondent/Petitioner No.1 died
during the pendency of this appeal.
7. It has been argued by learned counsel for
the insurer referring to FSL report that death of the
deceased was due to his ailment for which he was
being carried to Mangalore and the Tribunal has
committed an error in assessing the compensation
instead of dismissing the claim.
8.   Per  contra,  learned   counsel    for  the
petitioners submitted that the deceased though was
suffering from illness, he was being carried to
Mangalore, if he had been admitted to Mangalore
Hospital, he would have been survived with proper
treatment, but because of the accident, his ailment
was aggravated and for this reason, he died and FSL
report is nothing to do with it and the death was on
account of the accident and there is a nexus.
9. I have given my anxious consideration to the
arguments advanced on both sides and perused the
materials on record.
10. There is no dispute that the deceased was
suffering from jaundice and the cause of death as
mentioned in the FSL report was on account of
Jaundice. If the deceased was carried to provide him
with better treatment, if he had treated at Mangalore
his ailment could have been cured and walked out of
the hospital, jaundice is not a fatal ailment, better
treatment is available at higher medical centers like
Mangalore and for that reason, he was being carried
in an Ambulance. The driver though knew that he is
carrying a patient, did not take precaution while
driving, instead, he negligently caused the accident,
due to the impact, the ailment of the deceased was
aggravated and the patient died in the hospital.
Hence, there is nexus to accident and cause of death
of the deceased, but the percentage may vary and
therefore, there is no sound argument on behalf of
the insurance company. Hence, the ground urged for
dismissal of claim cannot be supported with.
11.  Insofar  as   award   of  compensation     is
concerned, the Tribunal has taken the income of the
deceased at Rs.5,000/- per month and deducted
50% towards personal expenses and applied the
multiplier of '17' for the age of the deceased at 26
years    and    assessed    loss  of  dependency      at
Rs.5,10,000/-. Under conventional heads, awarded
Rs.40,000/-, in all Rs.5,50,000/-.
12. At the time of accident, deceased was alive,
because of the accident he died. The reason for the
death has nexus to the accident though his serious
ailment aggravated death. Even assuming for the
sake of argument that the accident may have
impacted and aggravated the ailment, but it cannot
be more than 50%.        The accident was of the year
2010, the deceased was a bachelor aged 26 years,
he was an earning member, without proof of income,
his income is taken at Rs.5,500/- and 40% of future
prospects Rs.2,200/- is added in view of National
Insurance      Co.Ltd.    -vs-   Pranay   Sethi    and
Others1 case, then it comes to Rs.7,700/- if 50% of
the impact is taken out, then it will come to
Rs.3,850/-, since the deceased was a bachelor,
another      50%        is taken   out  towards    personal
expenses, it comes to Rs.1,925/- multiplied by '17',
the loss of dependency comes to Rs.3,92,700/-
13. Under the conventional heads, for love and
affection Rs.40,000/-, loss of estate and funeral
expenses         Rs.15,000/-     each   if   added,    then
compensation will come to Rs.4,62,700/- as against
a   sum      of    Rs.5,50,000/-.     Hence,   the  second
petitioner being the unmarried sister since father
died during pendency of the appeal, is entitled to
Rs.4,62,700/- as against Rs.5,50,000/- awarded by
the Tribunal.        Accordingly, the appeal needs to be
allowed and order of the Tribunal needs modification.
14. In the result, I pass the following:
The appeal is allowed in part.
The   judgment     and    award     passed  by    the
Tribunal stands modified.
The petitioner No.2 is entitled to compensation
of Rs.4,62,700/- with interest @ 6% per annum from
the date of petition till its realization.
The 2nd respondent is directed to satisfy the
award within 8 weeks from the date of receipt of
certified copy of this judgment.
The   amount    in   deposit,    if  any,  shall   be
transmitted to the Tribunal for disbursal forthwith.
