1.    Leave granted. These appeals are directed against the judgment
and order dated 15.11.2018 passed by the High Court of Delhi
whereby the Court upheld the common final order dated 24.08.2017
of the Central Administrative Tribunal, Principal Bench [hereinafter
referred to as the ‘Tribunal’ for short] and dismissed the petitions filed
by the North Delhi Municipal Corporation [hereinafter referred to as
the ‘NDMC’ for short]. The Tribunal declared that the applicants who
are ayurvedic doctors covered under AYUSH are also entitled to the
benefit of enhanced superannuation age of 65 years (raised from 60
years), just like the allopathic doctors. The entitlement of the
respondents to continue in service upto 65 years and receive due
remuneration for the same is the only issue to be considered in these
cases. For the sake of convenience, the relevant facts are taken from
SLP (C) No. 10156 of 2019.
2.    Prior to 31.05.2016, the retirement age was 60 years for the
General Duty Medical Officers [‘GDMO’ for short] of the Central Health
Scheme [‘CHS’ for short], the Dentists and Doctors covered under
AYUSH (including ayurvedic doctors). At that stage, the Government
of India, Ministry of Health and Family Welfare issued the order dated
31.05.2016, with immediate effect, enhancing upto 65 years, the age
of superannuation of the specialists of Non­teaching and public health
sub­cadres of CHS and GDMOs of CHS. This was followed by
consequential amendment of the Fundamental Rules, 1922 by Gazette
Notification dated 31.05.2016 of the Department of Personnel
Training. On 30.06.2016 the NDMC adopted the Government of India
order by issuing office order dated 30.06.2016 and enhanced the
retirement age to 65 years for the Allopathic doctors working in the
NDMC. The Office Memorandum issued by the Ministry of Health and
Family Welfare on 30.08.2016 then clarified that the enhanced
superannuation age granted by order dated 31.05.2016 is applicable
to GDMOs of CHS i.e. the allopathic doctors and municipal
corporations and others were given the liberty to take their own
decision on the matter, on the applicability of the Ministry’s decision
on enhancement of superannuation age. Thus, the ayurvedic doctors
were not seen to have been covered by the Ministry’s order dated
3.    The above led to several Original Applications (OA) filed by the
ayurvedic doctors, before the Tribunal. The respondent Dr. Ram
Naresh Sharma and other ayurvedic doctors sought the benefit of the
Government decision and the office order of NDMC, for it to be made
applicable to the ayurvedic doctors as well. On 09.12.2016 an interim
order was passed by the Tribunal to the following effect.:
Applicant may be allowed to continue in service
on the post held by him beyond the date of his
retirement/superannuation till further orders,
however, he will not be paid any salary nor
shall this order confer any right or equity in
favour of the Applicant.”
4.    By the common final order dated 24.08.2017, the Tribunal
accepted the discrimination argument advanced by the ayurvedic
doctors vis­à­vis the allopathic doctors. Accordingly, it was held that
the applicants were entitled to same service conditions including the
enhanced age of superannuation to 65 years, as made applicable to
doctors (GDMOs) working under the CHS, in terms of the order dated
31.05.2016 of Ministry of Health and Family Welfare. Thus, the
employer was directed to allow the ayurvedic doctors to continue in
service till the age of 65 years. It was clarified that in case any of the
applicants had been made to superannuate at the age of 60 years,
he/she shall be reinstated and be permitted to serve until the age of
65 years.
5.    Aggrieved by the above decision of the Tribunal, the appellant
NDMC preferred Writ Petitions before the High Court of Delhi. During
the pendency of writ petition, on 24.11.2017, the Ministry of
Ayurveda, Yoga, Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha and Homeopathy
(‘AYUSH’ for short), Government of India, issued an order whereby it
was communicated that the superannuation age of AYUSH doctors is
also enhanced to 65 years w.e.f. 27.09.2017, i.e. the date of approval
of Union Cabinet. It was however directed that the doctors shall hold
administrative positions only until age of 62 years and thereafter,
their service shall be placed in non­administrative positions.
6.    It may be noted that the High Court on 26.09.2017 in WP(C)
8704/2017 arising out of OA 2712/ 2016 (NDMC vs. Dr. Santosh
Kumar Sharma), had passed the following interim order:
Since the private respondents are still working
under the orders as passed by the Tribunal, the
respondents may continue to work, if they so
desire without receiving any salary as of now.
We are inclined to permit the respondents to
continue to serve this interim order, since
learned counsel for the private respondents have
stated, on instructions, that in case the
petitioner succeeds, they shall not claim any
equity on account of the fact that they have
rendered services under the order of the Court.
The respondents shall remain bound by their
said statements.”
7.    When the Writ Petition 637/2018 arising out of O.A. 4026/2016
of the respondent Dr. Ram Naresh Sharma came up for consideration,
the High Court on 23.01.2018 while issuing notice passed an interim
order to the following effect.
“In the meantime, the operation of the impugned
order shall remain stayed on the same terms as
recorded in the interim order dated 26.09.2017,
passed in W.P.8704/2017”
8.    The Writ Petitions challenging the Tribunal’s common order
dated 24.08.2017 were heard analogously and were dismissed
affirming the Tribunal’s conclusion in favor of the ayurvedic doctors.
The Tribunal noted in its order that although initially the benefit of
policy decision of government to enhance the retirement age was
confined to allopathic doctors but subsequently the policy decision
was made applicable to other category doctors (including ayurvedic
doctors), covered by AYUSH. Significantly, while the NDMC has
adopted the Ministry’s decision but those ayurvedic doctors of the
NDMC who fall in the window between 31.05.2016 and 26.09.2017,
are deprived of getting the benefit of the enhanced retirement age. In
other words, only those retiring on or after 27.09.2017, could aspire to
serve until 65 years.
9.    The High Court in the analogous judgment referred to the case
of Dr. Pratibha Sharma who was employed as an ayurvedic doctor
under the East Delhi Municipal Corporation [‘EDMC’] and observed
that her employer, unlike the NDMC, has not adopted the Government
decision dated 24.11.2017 to enhance the retirement age to 65 years
for the AYUSH category doctors. Taking note that Dr. Pratibha
Sharma’s employers had not adopted the AYUSH Ministry’s decision
dated 24.11.2017, it was left open to the EDMC to deal with her case
as deemed appropriate. With such finding and observation, the WPs
came to be dismissed upholding the view taken by the Tribunal in
favor of the ayurvedic doctors and consequential direction was issued
to the NDMC to disburse payment of arrears of salary and allowances
to the ayurvedic doctors, who continue to serve with the NDMC
beyond the age of 60 years. Specific direction was also issued on their
entitlement to salary and other allowances till they superannuate at
the age of 65 years. Aggrieved by the said decision of the High Court of
Delhi, the present Appeals are filed.
10.   The Respondents in SLP (C) No. 19288/2019 (Dr. Brijesh
Kumari) and SLP (C) No. 19287/2019 (Dr. Mohd. Ahmed Khan) are
Ayurvedic and Unani doctors respectively, working under the South
Delhi Municipal Corporation [‘SDMC’]. Dr. Brijesh Kumar was
supposed to retire on 31.07.2017 upon attaining age of 60 years,
whereas Dr. Mohd. Ahmed Khan was supposed to superannuate on
31.05.2017. Dr. Brijesh Kumar filed O.A. 2503/2017 in the Tribunal,
which came to be decided on 05.09.2017. In its order the Tribunal,
relied on its earlier judgment in the matter of Dr. Santosh Sharma,
whereby the respondents were allowed to continue in service till they
attain the age of 65 years. Similarly, Dr. Khan’s application came to
be decided on 21.09.2017 with like consequences. Aggrieved by these
orders, Writ Petitions were preferred by the SDMC impugning the
judgments by the Tribunal. These Writ Petitions were dismissed by the
Delhi High Court on same day i.e. 27.03.2019 vide judgments in W.P.
(C) No. 1776/2018 and W.P.(C) No. 1769/2019. In this Court, the
SDMC has averred that the order of AYUSH Ministry dated
24.11.2017 has been adopted by the SDMC on 31.10.2018, but the
approval for the same from the House of SDMC, is still pending.
Hence, it cannot be said that the SDMC has adopted the order of
AYUSH Ministry dated 24.11.2017.
11.    The respondent in SLP (C) 24693/2019, Dr. Lata A. Dupare, was
working as a dental surgeon under CGHS, Nagpur. Dr. Lata was
supposed to retire on 31.05.2016. The Tribunal by an order dated
17.11.2017 in O.A. 3795/2017 citing its own judgment in Dr. Santosh
Sharma, and Dr. H. P. Singh vs. Union of India 1 gave her the benefit of
extended superannuation age. Aggrieved by this order, the Union
preferred a W.P.(C) 3210/2019 in the High Court of Delhi which came
to be dismissed on 01.04.2019.
12.    We have heard the learned counsel appearing for the appellants
and the respondents. Questioning the legality of the impugned
decision, Mr. R. Balasubramaniam, learned senior counsel contends
that the benefit of enhanced retirement age should have been
extended only w.e.f. 27.09.2017 as per the AYUSH Ministry’s decision,
as there is limited scope for interference on a cut­off date, stipulated
by the government. The interim order dated 26.09.2017 in W.P.
8704/2017 of the High Court is read by the counsel to argue that
while the respondents were permitted to continue in service beyond 60
years, they are disentitled to claim any equitable relief by way of
arrear of salary on account of the fact that they remained in service
under interim orders of the court. The financial implication for the
employer is highlighted by the learned senior counsel to argue that
the appellants should not be burdened with the liability to disburse
the unpaid arrear salary to the respondents.
13.   On the other hand, the learned counsel for respondents argue
that relief to the respondents was granted by the Tribunal and by the
High Court by concluding that the action of the authorities in
treatment of the allopathic doctors vis­à­vis the ayurvedic doctors was
discriminatory and violative of Art. 14 of Constitution. Accordingly, it
is argued that there can be no separate service condition in so far as
the superannuation age is concerned between allopathic and other
category doctors, particularly when the AYUSH Ministry itself on
24.11.2017 has enhanced the retirement age for the non­allopathic
doctors w.e.f. 27.09.2017, in tune with the Ministry’s order dated
14.     Ld. Sr. Counsel for appellant relied on judgment of this Court in
U. P. State Brasswar Corporation Ltd. and Anr. vs. Uday Narain
Pandey2, and argued that while earlier, awarding full arrears of salary
was the practice, under the prevalent pragmatic view of the issue, the
Court should determine the award of back wages based on facts and
circumstances of each case. For the Bench, Justice S. B. Sinha in
“17. Before adverting to the decisions relied
upon by the learned counsel for the parties, we
may observe that although direction to pay full
back wages on a declaration that the order of
termination was invalid used to be the usual
result but now, with the passage of time, a
pragmatic view of the matter is being taken by
the court realizing that an industry may not be
compelled to pay to the workman for the period
during which he apparently contributed little or
nothing at all to it and/ or for a period that was
spent unproductively as a result whereof the
employer would be compelled to go back to a
situation which prevailed many years ago,
namely, when the workman was retrenched.”
15.    The above ratio in Uday Narain Pandey (supra) is however not
attracted to the matters before us, as there is significant difference in
the factual matrix. In the cited case, the respondent­worker had not
re­joined or continued his employment after his retirement, and was
asking for wages for work, he did not actually render. Whereas, in this
bunch of cases, it is undisputed that the respondent doctors have
continuously served in hospitals till attaining the enhanced age of
superannuation i.e. 65 years vide the AYUSH Ministry order dated
24.11.2017 and by virtue of interim order of the High Court dated
26.09.2017.      In other words, they have been productive not only for
the patients but also for their employers.
16.    The learned senior counsel for appellant by placing reliance
upon the HC interim order submits that respondent doctors are not
entitled to remuneration and unpaid arrears as they were serving in
the hospitals on the strength of the Court’s interim order. Such
argument for appellants cannot however be accepted in light of the
principle ‘Actus Curiae Neminem Gravabit’. Explaining the principle,
Justice B. S. Chauhan speaking for this court in Kalabharati
Advertising vs. Hemant Vimalnath Narichania3, stated the following:
gravabit", which means that the act of the Court
shall prejudice no­one, becomes applicable in such
a case. In such a situation the Court is under an
obligation to undo the wrong done to a party by the
act of the Court. Thus, any undeserved or unfair
jurisdiction of the Court must be neutralised, as the
institution of litigation cannot be permitted to confer
any advantage on a party by the delayed action of
the Court.”
17.    Bearing in mind the above legal principle the Interim order of
Delhi High Court dated 26.09.2017 in our opinion cannot be the basis
to deny salary and arrear benefits to respondents. The said interim
order merged with the final judgment dated 15.11.2018 and all
consequential benefits of employment were due to the respondents.
Therefore, when the respondents worked and served patients, the
basic benefit of salary cannot be denied to the doctors.
18.    This Court in case of Central Electricity Supply Utility of Odisha
“51....Till the declaration is made, the incumbent
service he cannot be deprived of his salary.
admitted and the incumbent functions in the
post and neither suspended nor removed from
service, he is entitled to get salary, for it is his
legal right and it is the duty of the employer to
pay it as per the terms and conditions of the
appointment.…”
The above ratio correctly sets out the employers’ responsibility to
pay the wages for the productive employees serving under them.
19.   In the case of New Okhla Industrial Development Authority &
Anr. vs. B. D. Singhal & Ors. 5, this Court while dealing with a
comparable issue, declined to give retrospective application to the U.P.
State Government order dated 30th September 2012, which extended
the age of superannuation from 58 years to 60 years. The arrears of
salary to respondent employees who had retired on 31 st August, 2012,
upon attaining the age of 58 years was also denied. But that case can
have    no  application      in   the    present appeals  since  facts are
distinguishable. There are two vital factual differences, which need to
be considered. Firstly, the Allahabad High Court retrospectively
applied the U.P. State Government order dated 30 th September 2012,
from 29th June 2002 i.e. the day on which recommendation for
extending the age of superannuation was made. Whereas, in the case
5 2021 SCC OnLine SC 466, C.A. No. 2311 of 2021
at hand, on 31.05.2016 a notification was issued which was
expeditiously    implemented.     Secondly, arrears   of   salary  were
disallowed,    because    the  respondent­employees    in  New    Okhla
Industrial Development Authority had not worked even a single day
after retiring, on attaining 58 years of age. But, in the present case,
respondent­doctors have been working continuously without break,
pursuant to the Interim order of the Delhi High Court dated
26.09.2017. Hence, based on these two distinguishing aspects, the
ratio in New Okhla Industrial Development Authority cannot in our
opinion be applicable here, to defeat the legitimate expectation of the
respondents.
20.   In these matters, for almost 5 years, the respondent doctors
have    been    providing   service  to  countless   patients,  without
remuneration or benefits. Their services are utilized by the employer
in Government establishments, without demur. In this regard, the
learned senior counsel for appellant submits that paying arrear
unpaid wages to the respondent doctors will impose substantial
financial burden upon the State. Such submission cannot however be
countenanced as a fair submission by the State’s counsel. The
principle of ‘No Work, No Pay’ protects employers from paying their
employees if they don’t receive service from them. A corollary thereto
of ‘No work should go unpaid’ should be the appropriate doctrine to be
followed in these cases where the service rendered by the respondent
doctors have been productive both for the patients and also the
employer. Therefore, we are quite clear in our mind that the
respondents must be paid their lawful remuneration­ arrears and
current, as the case may be. The State cannot be allowed plead
financial burden to deny salary for the legally serving doctors.
Otherwise it would violate their rights under Articles 14, 21 and 23 of
the Constitution.
21.   In the case of the respondent in SLP (C) 12046/2019 i.e. Dr. H.
P. Singh, it is averred by the appellants, that he has not worked after
superannuation on attaining the age of 60 years. But, there is
sufficient evidence on record to suggest that the respondent­doctor
through several representations sought to be re­appointed but it was
the employer who created impediments and did not allow the
respondent to re­join his duties in hospitals. In such circumstances,
the principle of ‘No Work, No Pay’ cannot be raised by the employers,
as it is they who had obstructed the doctor from discharging his
service. For support we may cite Dayanand Chakrawarthy vs. State of
Uttar Pradesh6 where this Court speaking through Justice S. J.
employer from performing his duties, the employee
cannot be blamed for having not worked, and the
applicable to such employee.”
22.    The common contention of the appellants before us is that
classification of AYUSH doctors and doctors under CHS in different
categories is reasonable and permissible in law. This however does not
appeal to us and we are inclined to agree with the findings of the
Tribunal and the Delhi High Court that the classification is
discriminatory and unreasonable since doctors under both segments
are performing the same function of treating and healing their
patients. The only difference is that AYUSH doctors are using
indigenous systems of medicine like Ayurveda, Unani, etc. and CHS
doctors are using Allopathy for tending to their patients. In our
understanding, the mode of treatment by itself under the prevalent
scheme of things, does not qualify as an intelligible differentia.
Therefore, such unreasonable classification and discrimination based
on it would surely be inconsistent with Article 14 of the Constitution.
The order of AYUSH Ministry dated 24.11.2017 extending the age of
superannuation to 65 Years also endorses such a view. This extension
is in tune with the notification of Ministry of Health and Family
Welfare dated 31.05.2016.
23.   The doctors, both under AYUSH and CHS, render service to
patients and on this core aspect, there is nothing to distinguish them.
Therefore, no rational justification is seen for having different dates for
bestowing the benefit of extended age of superannuation to these two
categories of doctors. Hence, the order of AYUSH Ministry (F. No. D.
14019/4/2016­E­I        (AYUSH))      dated    24.11.2017      must      be
retrospectively applied from 31.05.2016 to all concerned respondent­
doctors, in the present appeals. All consequences must follow from
this conclusion.
24.   In light of the above discussion, the appellant’s actions in not
paying the respondent doctors their due salary and benefits, while
their counterparts in CHS system received salary and benefits in full,
must be seen as discriminatory. Hence, we have no hesitation in
holding that the respondent­doctors are entitled to their full salary
arrears and the same is ordered to be disbursed, within 8 weeks from
today. Belated payment beyond the stipulated period will carry
interest, at the rate of 6% from the date of this order until the date of
payment. It is ordered accordingly. The appeals are disposed of in
above terms without any order on cost.
