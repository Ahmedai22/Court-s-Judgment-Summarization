The instant appeal has been filed by the Insurance
Company (defendant in the claim petition) against the judgment
and decree dated 23.10.2021 passed by the Additional District
Judge No.4, Bikaner in Civil Original Suit No. 07/2020, whereby
while allowing the suit filed by the dependents of the deceased
Premaram      @   Premratan     under   the   Fatal   Accident    Act,
compensation of Rs.5,94,160/- has been awarded for which
employer, Pratibha Industries Limited Nagaur, its Supervisor,
Managing Director and Insurance Company were made liable
jointly and severely.
Deceased Premaram @ Premratan was an employee in
Pratibha Industries Ltd. He died on 18.6.2008, during the course
of his employment, while he was doing work of removing soil from
the pipeline in the ditch. The masala mixture machine fell upon
him as a result of which he collapsed. At the time of his death, he
was aged 25 years and earning Rs.250/- per day in lieu of labour
work. At that time, defendant nos. 1 and 2 were Supervisor and
Managing Director of the Pratibha Industries Ltd. The incident was
reported to the police, upon which FIR No. 231/2008 under
Section 302 and 287 IPC was registered. All the employees
working under Pratibha Industries Ltd. were insured under the
Wokmen’s Compensation Act, 1923 (now amended as The
Employees’s Compensation Act, 1923 w.e.f. 18.1.2010) (herein-
afterwards referred to as ‘the Act of 1923’).
After trial, the learned trial court decreed the suit.
Aggrieved with the same, this first appeal has been filed.
Learned counsel for the appellants during arguments on
admission submits that the insurance company issued policy in the
category of workmen compensation for 30 employees drawing
salary less than Rs.4,000/-. Since deceased was employee of
Pratibha Industries Ltd., the dependents of deceased had remedy
to file claim petition under the Employee’s Compensation Act,
1923.    Insurance Company is liable only under the provisions of
the Act of 1923. He also submits that wife of the deceased has re-
married, so she is not entitled to get the compensation. He further
submits that the Insurance Company was impleaded as party
respondent only on 30.11.2010 at a belated stage.
Learned counsel for the appellants also submits that
the income of the deceased was more than Rs.4,000/- per month,
whereas, the insurance was with regard to workers drawing salary
less than Rs.4,000/- per month each. At the time of incident, no
security measures were provided to the employees by the
employer. Therefore, the conditions of the policy have also been
violated. Learned counsel for the appellants further submits that
the deceased was working for sub-contractor.
Considered     the  arguments     raised by the   learned
counsel for the appellants and perused the record.
It is not in dispute that the deceased was an employee
of Pratibha Industries Ltd. It is also not in dispute that Workmen
Compensation Policy issued in favour of Pratibha Industries Ltd. by
the appellant – Insurance Company was in force at the time of
incident. It is not in dispute that the compensation was assessed
on the monthly income of Rs. 2600/- of the deceased, which is
below Rs.4,000/- per month. Regarding not filing claim under the
Act of 1923, it is made clear that though claimants had remedy
under the Act of 1923 also, however, there is no bar to file suit for
compensation under the provisions of Fatal Accident Act, 1855.
The provisions of Fatal Accident Act, 1855 applies against all
wrong doers including the employer. The scope of the provisions of
Fatal Accident Act, 1855 is wider than the scope of Act of 1923.
Civil Courts are competent to entertain any civil dispute unless it
is barred by any law. There is no bar under any provisions of law
to claim compensation under the Fatal Accident Act by employee
against his employer. Hence, the contention of the learned counsel
for the appellant in this regard is prima facie not tenable.
The other grounds raised by the learned counsel for the
appellants are also not tenable. Contention with regard to re-
marrying of the deceased’s wife is concerned, the same does not
disentitle her from claiming compensation for death of her
husband. The amount of compensation awarded by the learned
trial court looking to the young age of the deceased and number
of claimants cannot be said to be unreasonable. There is no merit
in this appeal.
Accordingly, this first appeal stands dismissed at
admission stage.
