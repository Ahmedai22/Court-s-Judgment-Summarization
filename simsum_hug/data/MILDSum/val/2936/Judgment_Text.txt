1.     No one is present either for the applicant or for respondents no. 2
to 6 when this case is taken up for hearing. Learned A.G.A. is however
present for the State.
2.     Instant appeal has been filed by the victim under Section 372
Cr.P.C. against the judgment and order dated 07.03.2013 passed by the
Judicial Magistrate, Ambedkar Nagar whereby the trial Court has
convicted the private respondents under Sections 323, 498-A, 506
I.P.C. and Section 3/4 D.P. Act, however, the accused persons/private
respondents instead of sentencing to undergo imprisonment            were
given the benefit of Probation of Offenders Act, 1958 and released on
probation and also against the judgment and order dated 30.09.2016
passed by the Appellate Court i.e. Additional Sessions Judge (Fast
Track Court-II), Ambedkar Nagar, whereby the appeal preferred by the
state against sentence was dismissed.
3.     Perusal of the record would reveal that the instant appeal has
been listed after a long time as it was on 04.12.2017 this appeal was
last listed and vide order dated 20.11.2017 the delay, which had
occurred in preferring the appeal has been condoned by a co-ordinate
Bench of this Court and the appeal was directed to be listed for
4.     Section 372 of the Cr.P.C., under which the instant appeal has
been preferred, is reproduced for ready reference as under:-
"372. No appeal to lie unless otherwise provided.— No appeal shall
lie from any judgment or order of a criminal court except as provided
for by this Code or by any other law for the time being in force:
Provided that the victim shall have a right to prefer an appeal against
any order passed by the court acquitting the accused or convicting for a
lesser offence or imposing inadequate compensation, and such appeal
shall lie to the court to which an appeal ordinarily lies against the order
of conviction of such court."
5.     Perusal of this Section would reveal that the same is starting
with a Non-Obstante Clause declaring that no appeal shall lie from any
judgment or order of a Criminal Court except as provided by this Code
or by any other law for the time being in force. Thus, it is clear that the
appeal could only be preferred in accordance with the scheme provided
in the Cr.P.C. or provided by any other law for the time being in force.
The proviso to Section 372 Cr.P.C. provides a right to the victim of an
offence to prefer an appeal and it says that the victim (as defined under
Section 2w (wa) of the Cr.P.C. may prefer an appeal against any
judgment or order passed by the Court acquitting the accused or
convicting      for  a    lesser  offence   or    imposing     inadequate
compensation. Thus, the appeal under Section 372 Cr.P.C. could only
be filed on the happening of three situations namely
(ii) When the accused person(s0 have been convicted for a lesser
(iii) Where inadequate compensation has been imposed by the Court
6.     The instant appeal has been preferred by the victim against the
order of the trial court as well as of the first Appellate Court and it is
evident that though the accused persons were convicted by the trial
Court for the offence committed under Sections 323, 498-A, 506 I.P.C.
and Section 3/4 D.P. Act, however, instead of sentencing them to
undergo imprisonment             the trial Court has given them benefit of
Section 4 of Probation of Offenders Act, 1958 and released themon
probation and the appeal preferred by the state against sentencing has
also been dismissed by the appellate Court.
7.      The issue as to whether a victim of the crime may prefer an
appeal under section 372 Crpc against inadequacy of sentence awarded
to the accused persons is now no more res integra. Hon’ble Supreme
Court in National Commission For Women v. State of Delhi, (2010)
12 SCC 599 has held as under:-
“11. An appeal is a creature of a statute and cannot lie under any inherent power.
This Court does undoubtedly grant leave to appeal under the discretionary power
conferred under Article 136 of the Constitution of India at the behest of the State
or an affected private individual but to permit anybody or an organisation pro
bono publico to file an appeal would be a dangerous doctrine and would cause
utter confusion in the criminal justice system. We are, therefore, of the opinion that
the special leave petition itself was not maintainable.
12. In Pritam Singh v. State [AIR 1950 SC 169 : (1950) 51 Cri LJ 1270] this Court
while dealing with a criminal matter (after the grant of leave under Article 136 of
the Constitution) considered the scope and ambit of this article and observed:
“9. On a careful examination of Article 136 along with the preceding article, it
seems clear that the wide discretionary power with which this Court is invested
under it is to be exercised sparingly and in exceptional cases only, and as far as
possible a more or less uniform standard should be adopted in granting special
leave in the wide range of matters which can come up before it under this article.
By virtue of this article, we can grant special leave in civil cases, in criminal
cases, in income tax cases, in cases which come up before different kinds of
tribunals and in a variety of other cases. The only uniform standard which in our
opinion can be laid down in the circumstances is that Court should grant special
leave to appeal only in those cases where special circumstances are shown to exist.
… It is sufficient for our purpose to say that though we are not bound to follow
them too rigidly since the reasons, constitutional and administrative, which
sometimes weighed with the Privy Council, need not weigh with us, yet some of
those principles are useful as furnishing in many cases a sound basis for invoking
the discretion of this Court in granting special leave. Generally speaking, this
Court will not grant special leave, unless it is shown that exceptional and special
circumstances exist, that substantial and grave injustice has been done and that
the case in question presents features of sufficient gravity to warrant a review of
the decision appealed against.”
13. In P.S.R. Sadhanantham v. Arunachalam [(1980) 3 SCC 141 : 1980 SCC (Cri)
649] this Court was dealing with the locus standi of a private person, in this case
the victim's brother, who was neither a complainant nor a first informant in the
criminal case but had filed a petition under Article 136 of the Constitution of
India. This Court observed that the strictest vigilance was required to be
maintained to prevent the abuse of the process of court, more particularly, in
criminal matters, and ordinarily a private party other than the complainant,
should not be permitted to file an appeal under Article 136, though the broad
scope of the article postulated an exception in suitable cases. It was spelt out as
under: (SCC p. 145, para 7)
“7. Specificity being essential to legality, let us see if the broad spectrum spread
out of Article 136 fills the bill from the point of view of ‘procedure established by
law’. In express terms, Article 136 does not confer a right of appeal on a party as
such but it confers a wide discretionary power on the Supreme Court to interfere in
suitable cases. The discretionary dimension is considerable but that relates to the
power of the court. The question is whether it spells by implication, a fair
procedure as contemplated by Article 21. In our view, it does. Article 136 is a
special jurisdiction. It is residuary power; it is extraordinary in its amplitude, its
limit, when it chases injustice, is the sky itself. This Court functionally fulfils itself
by reaching out to injustice wherever it is and this power is largely derived in the
common run of cases from Article 136. Is it merely a power in the court to be
exercised in any manner it fancies? Is there no procedural limitation in the manner
of exercise and the occasion for exercise? Is there no duty to act fairly while
hearing a case under Article 136, either in the matter of grant of leave or, after
such grant, in the final disposal of the appeal? We have hardly any doubt that
there is a procedure necessarily implicit in the power vested in the summit court. It
must be remembered that Article 136 confers jurisdiction on the highest court. The
Founding Fathers unarguably intended in the very terms of Article 136 that it shall
be exercised by the highest judges of the land with scrupulous adherence to
judicial principles well established by precedents in our jurisprudence. Judicial
discretion is canalised authority, not arbitrary eccentricity.”
14. The Court then examined the implications of completely shutting out a private
party from filing a petition under Article 136 on the locus standi and observed
thus: (Arunachalam case [(1980) 3 SCC 141 : 1980 SCC (Cri) 649] , SCC p. 147,
“14. Having said this, we must emphasise that we are living in times when many
societal pollutants create new problems of unredressed grievance when the State
becomes the sole repository for initiation of criminal action. Sometimes,
pachydermic indifference of bureaucratic officials, at other times politicisation of
higher functionaries may result in refusal to take a case to this Court under Article
136 even though the justice of the lis may well justify it. While ‘the criminal law
should not be used as a weapon in personal vendettas between private
individuals’, as Lord Shawcross once wrote, in the absence of an independent
prosecution authority easily accessible to every citizen, a wider connotation of the
expression ‘standing’ is necessary for Article 136 to further its mission.”
15. A reading of the aforesaid excerpts from the two judgments would reveal that
while an appeal by a private individual can be entertained but it should be done
sparingly and after due vigilance and particularly in a case where the remedy has
been shut out for the victims due to mala fides on the part of the State
functionaries or due to inability of the victims to approach the Court. In the
present matter, we find that neither the State which is the complainant nor the
heirs of the deceased have chosen to file a petition in the High Court. As this
responsibility has been taken up by the Commission at its own volition this is
clearly not permissible in the light of the aforesaid judgments.”
8.      In Parvinder Kansal v. State (NCT of Delhi), (2020) 19 SCC
496 Hon’ble Supreme Court has also held as under:-
“8. Chapter XXIX of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 deals with “Appeals”
and Section 372 makes it clear that no appeal to lie unless otherwise provided by
the Code or any other law for the time being in force. It is not in dispute that in the
instant case appellant has preferred appeal only under Section 372 CrPC. The
proviso is inserted to Section 372 CrPC by Act 5 of 2009. Section 372 and the
proviso which is subsequently inserted read as under:
“372. No appeal to lie unless otherwise provided.— No appeal shall lie from any
judgment or order of a criminal court except as provided for by this Code or by
any other law for the time being in force:
Provided that the victim shall have a right to prefer an appeal against any order
passed by the court acquitting the accused or convicting for a lesser offence or
imposing inadequate compensation, and such appeal shall lie to the court to which
an appeal ordinarily lies against the order of conviction of such court.”
A reading of the proviso makes it clear that so far as victim's right of appeal is
concerned, same is restricted to three eventualities, namely, acquittal of the
accused; conviction of the accused for lesser offence; or for imposing inadequate
compensation. While the victim is given opportunity to prefer appeal in the event
of imposing inadequate compensation, but at the same time there is no provision
for appeal by the victim for questioning the order of sentence as inadequate,
whereas Section 377 CrPC gives the power to the State Government to prefer
appeal for enhancement of sentence. While it is open for the State Government to
prefer appeal for inadequate sentence under Section 377 CrPC but similarly no
appeal can be maintained by victim under Section 372 CrPC on the ground of
inadequate sentence. It is fairly well-settled that the remedy of appeal is creature
of the statute. Unless same is provided either under Code of Criminal Procedure
or by any other law for the time being in force no appeal, seeking enhancement of
sentence at the instance of the victim, is maintainable. Further we are of the view
that the High Court while referring to the judgment of this Court in National
Commission for Women v. State (NCT of Delhi) [National Commission for
Women v. State (NCT of Delhi), (2010) 12 SCC 599 : (2011) 1 SCC (Cri) 774]
has rightly relied on the same and dismissed the appeal, as not maintainable.”
9.      Above placed case laws makes it clear that no appeal can be
maintained by the victim under Section 372 CrPC on the ground of
inadequacy of sentence. Thus the appeal preferred by the victim of the
crime against inadequacy of             sentence is not maintainable and is
dismissed as such.
