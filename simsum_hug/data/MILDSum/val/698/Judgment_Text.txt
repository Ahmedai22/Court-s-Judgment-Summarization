Heard the learned counsel Sri.Ranganatha S. Jois
for the petitioners, learned Additional Government
Advocate Sri.M.V.Ramesh Jois for respondent No.1 and
learned counsel Sri.H.L.Pradeep Kumar for respondent
No.2. Perused the writ petition papers.
2.     Learned counsel for the petitioners would
submit    that   the    petitioners retired from   second
respondent – the Karnataka Housing Board (for short
KHB) on attaining the age of superannuation on
30.06.2018 and 31.08.2020 respectively. Subsequent to
their retirement, Annexure-C, Charge Memo dated
21.06.2022 is issued to the petitioners initiating enquiry
in respect of an event taken place in the year 2005-06.
Learned counsel would submit that in terms of Rule 214
(2) (b)(ii) of the Karnataka Civil Services Rules [for short
KCSRs], Charge memo would not be maintainable and
no enquiry could be initiated against a retired person in
respect of an event which had taken place more than
four years prior to institution of enquiry against retired
Government Servant. Thus, he submits that only on the
ground that initiation of enquiry under Annexure-C,
Charge Memo dated 21.06.2022 is barred under Rule
214 (2) (b)(ii) of the KCSRs, it is liable to be set aside.
3.      Learned counsel Sri.H.L.Pradeep Kumar on
instructions would submit that initially enquiry was
initiated against the petitioners while they were in
service      on     28.09.2013    and     thereafter    under
Annexure-B, order dated 21.08.2014, petitioners were
exonerated       of  the  Charges.    Subsequently    on    the
recommendation of the Public Accounts Committee, the
present proceedings is initiated. Thus, he submits that
there is continuation of cause of action. Hence, he
justifies     the     Charge        Memo      issued      against   the
4.      It is not in dispute that petitioners retired on
30.06.2018 and 31.08.2020 respectively on attaining
the    age      of    superannuation.            Charge     Memo     at
Annexure-C dated 21.06.2022 was issued subsequent
to retirement of petitioners. The first charge against the
petitioners reads as follows:
¨É¼ÀUÁA f¯ÉèAiÀÄ PÀAPÀ£ÀªÁr UÁæªÀÄzÀ gÁªÀÄzÀÄUÀð

A reading of the above Charge would clearly
indicates that the Charge is against an incident which
had taken place in the year 2006.
6.     Rule 214 (2)(b)(ii) of the KCSRs reads thus:
“214       (2)   (b)    The     departmental
proceedings,       if  not   instituted    while   the
Government servant was in service, whether
before     his   retirement    or   during    his   re-
employment.
(ii) shall not be in respect of any event
which took place more than four years before
such institution.”
The  above    Rule which is applicable     to the
employees of KHB would not permit initiation of enquiry
in respect of an event which took place more than 4
years before such institution in respect of a retired
7.   In the case on hand, initiation of enquiry
and issuance     of Charge     Memo dated 21.06.2022
(Annexure-C) is in respect of an event which took place
more than 4 years before such institution against
retired petitioners. Thus, the institution of enquiry
under Charge Memo is barred by Rule 214 (2)(b)(ii) of
KCSRs. Thus, the Charge Memo is not sustainable in
law. Hence, the following:
b)   Annexure-C,     Charge    Memo  bearing
dated 21.06.2022 as well as Annexure-D,
appointment of Enquiry Officer bearing
dated 20.08.2022 are quashed.
c) The respondent No.2 is directed to
settle the terminal benefits of the
petitioners if there is no other enquiry
or impediment to release within three
months, if not already settled.
