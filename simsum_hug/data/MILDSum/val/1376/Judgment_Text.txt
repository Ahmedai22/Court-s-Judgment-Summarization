This petition has been filed seeking a direction to the second
respondent to produce the body of the petitioner's father Athikesavan, aged
about 74 years, before this Court and set him at liberty.
2. For the sake of convenience, the characters in this case will be
referred to by their names.
3. One Athikesavan, aged around 72 years, a bangle seller, was living
with his wife Ramathilagam in Door No.38/17, Muthiyaal Reddy Street,
Alandur, Chennai â€“ 600 016. He has three sons and one daughter viz.,
Thulasidass, Nandagopal, Mannivannan and Mahalakshmi, who are living
separately.
4. On 09.06.2020, Adikesavan was feeling a little unwell and therefore,
he went to the nearby Primary Health Centre and undertook Covid-19 test.
On 10.06.2020, he was informed that he was tested positive. In accordance
with the protocol established by the Government, the Corporation authorities
were alerted and one Ms.Divya Rani, Sanitary Inspector, went to the
residence of Adikesavan on 11.06.2020 and made arrangements for taking
him to Ekkattuthangal Urban Primary Health Centre (Division 170), for
further screening. She made arrangements to take Adikesavan by an
ambulance belonging to the Corporation of Chennai and the ambulance driver
was one Raman.
5. Adikesavan was taken to the said Ekkattuthangal Urban Primary
Health Centre along with another patient, by name, Akash Jain. At the
screening centre, Adikesavan was subjected to various medical examinations
and the doctors there felt that home quarantine would not be advisable for
him and therefore, referred him to Government Kilpauk Medical College and
Hospital for admission and treatment.
6. Accordingly, a 108 ambulance was arranged and Adikesavan was
sent to Government Kilpauk Medical College and Hospital on 11.06.2020.
Since Adikesavan did not have a mobile phone, his family members lost track
of him. Since they did not know the whereabouts of Adikesavan, they went
looking out for him at the screening centre and also at Government Kilpauk
Medical College and Hospital, but in vain.
7. Mannivannan, younger son of Adikesavan, went to S-1, St.Thomas
Mount Police Station on 17.06.2020 and gave a complaint saying that the
whereabouts of his father were not known to the family after he was taken
from his house for Covid-19 treatment. Based on the complaint, S-1,
St.Thomas Mount police did not register a regular First Information Report of
8. The disheartened family sent an online complaint on 21.06.2020
through the portal of the Tamil Nadu Police website, which was redirected to
G3, Kilpauk Police Station, where a First Information Report in Crime
No.458 of 2020 was registered for 'man-missing' on 23.06.2020.
9. Thereafter, the St.Thomas Mount police, belatedly, registered a CSR
on 25.06.2020 and assigned CSR No.88/2020 for the petitioner's complaint
dated 17.06.2020.
10. Since the police were not able to trace Adikesavan, Thulasidass,
elder son of Adikesavan, has filed the present Habeas Corpus Petition on
11. On 07.07.2020, it was brought to the notice of this Court that
Adikesavan was taken from Government Kilpauk Medical College and
Hospital to Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital and a video clipping
was submitted showing him walking out of the gate of Rajiv Gandhi
Government General Hospital. Therefore, this Court suo motu impleaded the
Inspector of Police, C1 Flower Bazaar Police Station, Chennai, as the third
respondent.
12. On 15.07.2020, this Court impleaded the Commissioner,
Corporation of Chennai, as the fourth respondent and called for a status
report from them.
13. Mr.G.Prakash, the then Commissioner of Greater Chennai
Corporation filed a status report dated 24.07.2020, wherein it is stated as

During that time Mr.Adhikesavan has given a mobile number
9941391821 as his contact number. The test result
Mr.Adhikesavan was found to be positive. As per standard
protocol, the Division Sanitary Inspector Miss Dhivya had called

examined the person and lab reports and referred
Mr.Adhikesavan to Government Kilpauk Medical College

Kilpauk Medical College Hospital the next day and enquired the
hospital authorities regarding the patient Mr.Adhikesavan. His
name was not found in the admission register at Government

Government Hospitals and found that there was no unclaimed
body.

Corporation Officials are sincerely taking efforts to trace the
missing person. The respondent Corporation is confident that the
person will be traced with the cooperation of Police and the
family members.'
14. On 01.08.2020, the case in G3, Kilpauk PS Crime No.458 of 2020
was transferred to the file of the Inspector of Police, C1 Flower Bazaar Police
Station. On 22.12.2020, the Inspector of Police, C1 Flower Bazaar Police
Station, filed a status report, with which we were not satisfied and hence, we
directed the presence of the Deputy Commissioner of Police, Kilpauk
District, on 25.02.2021. Accordingly, on 25.02.2021, Mr.Saminathan, Deputy
Commissioner of Police, Kilpauk District, appeared before us and we
directed him to supervise the investigation that was conducted by the C1
Flower Bazaar police and directed him to file a status report.
15. Mr.Saminathan, the Deputy Commissioner of Police, filed two
status reports dated 26.04.2021 and 15.06.2021 setting out the steps that
were being taken for tracing Adikesavan.
16. Thus, from the status reports filed by the Commissioner of Greater
Chennai Corporation and the Deputy Commissioner of Police, it is limpid that
Adikesavan underwent Covid-19 test on 09.06.2020 in the local Primary
Health Centre and was tested positive on 10.06.2020; Divya Rani, Sanitary
Inspector, sent him by an ambulance of the Chennai Corporation with one
Raman as driver to the National Skill Training Institute Covid Screening
Centre, Guindy, where the Ekkattuthangal Urban Primary Health Centre was
functioning; Adikesavan underwent the screening test there and on the advice
of the doctors there, he was sent by 108 ambulance, driven by one Rajan to
Government Kilpauk and Medical College Hospital on 11.06.2020; from
there, the same ambulance carried him to Rajiv Gandhi Government General
Hospital, Chennai, for being admitted as an inpatient; thereafter, the
whereabouts of Adikesavan are not known till date except the video clippings
of Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital showing Adikesavan walking
out of the hospital gate; when the family members of Adikesavan were shown
the video clippings, they confirmed the person as Adikesavan.
17. The case came up for hearing on 17.08.2021 and based on the
submissions made by the learned State Public Prosecutor, the following order
"Today, Mrs.K.Shobana, Inspector of Police, C-1, Flower
Bazaar Police Station, Mr.P.Saminathan, Superintendent of Police,
Special Security Branch and Ms.Divya, Sanitary Inspector are
present before this Court.
2. On instructions, Mr.Hasan Mohammed Jinnah, learned
Public Prosecutor submitted that an unidentified body resembling by
and large to Adikesavan was found on 03.08.2020 in Egmore area, in
connection with which, a case in Egmore P.S.Crime No.636 of 2020
has been registered on 03.08.2020 under Section 174 Cr.P.C.
3. Mr.Hasan Mohammed Jinnah futher submitted that after
taking the finger prints and other measurements, the body has been
buried by the Egmore police. He also submitted that if the petitioner
appears before the Inspector of Police, C-1, Flower Bazaar Police
Station, the police would take steps to match satisfactorily the
identity of the dead body with that of the missing person Adikesavan
through scientific means.
4. We find sufficient force in the above submission of
Mr.Hasan Mohammed Jinnah. In view of the above, we direct the
petitioner to cooperate with the police for the aforesaid purpose. If
necessary, the police is also permitted to exhume the body for the
purpose of either superimposition or DNA profiling. The revenue
authorities shall also cooperate with the police in this regard.
Post this matter on 14.09.2021."
18. Pursuant to the above order, the matter was once again taken up for
hearing on 22.03.2022 and an additional status report was filed by the
Inspector of Police, C1 Flower Bazaar Police Station, Chennai. Taking note
of the additional status report, the following order was passed by this Court:
"Today, Mr.R.Dhalavoisamy, Inspector of Police, C1 Flower
Bazaar Police Station, Chennai, and Ms.S.Dhivya, Sanitary
Inspector, Alandur [Mobile No.94450 25962] are present.
2. Mr.R.Dhalavoisamy, Inspector of Police, has filed an
additional status report dated 21.03.2022, wherein, it is stated that
the DNA report dated 29.12.2021 showed negative results, in that,
the DNA extracted from the exhumed body did not tally with the
DNA of Thulasidass Adikesavan s/o.Adikesavan.
3. Mr.R.Muniyapparaj, learned Additional Public Prosecutor,
submitted that the police are now trying to find out, if Adikesavan
had died of any rail accident.
At the request of the learned Additional Public Prosecutor,
adjd. to 19.04.2022."
19. The case came up for hearing thereafter on various occasions and
the fact remains that till date, the missing person Adikesavan has not been
traced either dead or alive and the stalemate continues.
20. We do appreciate the fact that the State of Tamil Nadu and the
Greater Chennai Corporation were doing their best to fight the Covid-19 war.
Therefore, we cannot fix the blame on any single officer for the lapse.
However, it would have been in the fitness of things, if the Inspector of
Police, S1, St.Thomas Mount Police Station, had registered a regular First
Information Report of 'man-missing' when the complaint was given to him on
17.06.2020 itself. Instead, the family was made to run from pillar to post and
ultimately, after great persuasion, the First Information Report in Crime
No.458 of 2020 was registered by the Inspector of Police, G3 Kilpauk Police
Station, only on 23.06.2020.
21. It is the grievance of the family of Adikesavan that had the police
acted with alacrity, the police would have been in a position to trace
Adikesavan. We do see sufficient force in the grievance ventilated by the
family of Adikesavan.
22. The Inspector of Police, C1 Flower Bazaar Police Station, Chennai,
is directed to continue with the investigation and take effective steps to find
the whereabouts of the missing person Adikesavan. The Investigation Officer
shall also take note of the guidelines issued by this Court in K.Sukumari v.
The Superintendent of Police, Virudhunagar District, Virudhunagar and
others [2018 (2) LW (Crl) 636], since the pending First Information Report
23. Taking into consideration the overall fact situation, we do not want
to be too harsh on the State Government and instead, on humanitarian ground,
we direct the State to pay a sum of Rs.1,00,000/- [Rupees One Lakh only] as
compensation to the family of Adikesavan within a period of four weeks from
the date of receipt of the copy of this order.
With the above direction, this Habeas Corpus Petition is disposed of.
