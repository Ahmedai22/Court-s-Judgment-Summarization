Counsel for Petitioner :- N.L. Srivastava,Bibhuti Narayan
Counsel for Respondent :- C.S.C.
1.     Heard learned counsel for the petitioners and the learned
Standing Counsel for the State-respondents.
2.     The present writ petition is preferred challenging the
order dated 28th January, 2015 passed by DIG (Establishment),
Police Head Quarter, U.P., Allahabad and with a further prayer
to issue a mandamus directing the respondent no.2 to appoint
petitioner no.2 on compassionate ground in the office of the
3.     The submission of the learned counsel for the petitioners
is that the husband of petitioner no.1 and father of petitioner
no.2, namely, Late Prem Shankar Dwivedi was a Constable and
he was posted at District Sultanpur in the year 1999. Late Prem
Shankar Dwivedi died during his service while working on the
post of Constable in District - Sultanpur. After the death of the
deceased employee, petitioner no.1 submitted a representation
dated 9th September 1999 before respondent no.2 and requested
that petitioner no.1 is an illiterate lady and, therefore,
compassionate appointment may be granted to her elder son,
namely, Shri Dinesh Kumar Dwivedi, as there is no earning
member in the family of petitioner no.1 after death of her
4.     After completion of all the formalities and after due
inquiry with regard to financial status of family, respondent
no.2, has issued appointment letter dated 11th December, 2014
appointing Shri Dinesh Kumar Dwivedi (eldest son of deceased
employee) on the post of Constable (M) and the aforesaid
appointment letter dated 11th December, 2004 further provided
that Shri Dinesh Kumar Dwivedi will appear before the Police
Training Centre, Moradabad on 15th December, 2004 for six
months training. Unfortunately, mental condition of Dinesh
Kumar Dwivedi was very serious on 14th December, 2004 and,
therefore, in place of joining the place of Training Centre,
Moradabad for training on 15th December, 2004, he was
hospitalized at Primary Health Centre, Tarun, Faizabad on 17 th
December, 2004 as he was suffering from mental disease and
was continuously undergoing treatment.
5.     On account of the aforesaid fact, eldest son of petitioner
no.1 (namely Shri Dinesh Kumar Dwivedi ) could not join the
aforesaid post. On 2nd May, 2006, petitioner no.1 filed a
representation along with an affidavit before the respondent
no.2 with a request that mental condition of her son namely
Shri Dinesh Kumar Dwivedi has deteriorated and is unable to
join the post in question and as such appointment letter may be
issued in favour of petitioner no.2, being younger son of
petitioner no.1, namely, Shri Manoj Kumar Dwivedi for being
appointed on compassionate ground.
6.     After    receiving  the    aforesaid  representation    of
petitioners, respondent no.2 did not pass any order and as such
petitioners preferred a reminder dated 1st January, 2008 before
respondent no.2 along with an affidavit and medical certificate
of Shri Dinesh Kumar Dwivedi. The petitioners thereafter
approached the respondent no.2 on several occasions for
consideration    of   appointment     of   petitioner   no.2   on
compassionate ground in place of his elder brother. However,
no action was taken on the request of the petitioners.
7.     Thereafter, the petitioner no.2 met respondent no.2
personally on 2nd July, 2008 at his office and narrated the entire
grievance and further requested for grant of compassionate
appointment. On the aforesaid, respondent no.2 orally directed
the petitioner no.1 to file a fresh representation in respect of
grant of compassionate appointment and in furtherance thereof,
petitioner no. 1 has filed a representation dated 5 th July, 2008
along with an affidavit and medical certificate of Shri Dinesh
Kumar Dwivedi before the respondent no.2.
8.     Despite the aforesaid representation, no order was passed
by the respondent no.2 for grant of compassionate appointment
and as such the petitioner preferred Writ-A No.67008 of 2008
before this Court wherein a direction was issued on 27 th August,
2012 to respondent no. 2 to consider the claim for
compassionate appointment of petitioner no.2 in accordance
with law by a reasoned order within a period of six weeks from
the date of submission of a certified copy of the order. The
respondent no.2 thereafter, referred the matter to respondent
no.1 for condonation of delay in accordance with Rule 5 of U.P.
Recruitment of Dependants of Government Servants Dying in
Harness Rules, 1974 (hereinafter referred as Rules of 1974).
The State Government by means of a communication dated 19th
January, 2015 to the Police Head Quarter has rejected the
application for compassionate appointment and has refused to
condone      the  delay   in   preferring    the   application for
compassionate appointment. In pursuance to the aforesaid, the
respondent no.2 passed the impugned order dated 28th January,
2015 rejecting the claim of the petitioners.
9.     It is submitted by learned counsel for the petitioners that
the rejection of the claim of the petitioners is arbitrary and is
not tenable under law. He submits that impugned order takes
notice of the fact that the deceased employee expired on 7 th
August,     1999    and   the    application   for   compassionate
appointment was submitted on 6th May, 2013, which is after a
period of 13 years from the date of death of the employee and
as such the application was held to be time barred. The
respondents further did not find it appropriate to condone the
delay in filing the application.
10.    The submission of learned counsel for the petitioners is
that the initial application for grant of compassionate
appointment was submitted on 9th September, 1999 before the
respondent no.2 and on the aforesaid application, appointment
letter was issued in favour of eldest son of petitioner no.1 on
11th December, 2004. However, eldest son of petitioner no.1
could not join in pursuance of the appointment letter as he was
mentally unfit and on account of aforesaid fact, petitioner no.1
again filed a representation dated 2nd May, 2006 before
respondent no.1, that in place of eldest son of petitioner no. 1
namely Shri Dinesh Kumar Dwivedi, who is now mentally
unsound, the younger son of petitioner no.1, namely, Shri
Manoj Kumar Dwivedi (Petitioner no. 2) be appointed. It is
further submitted that the aforesaid application remained
pending and the petitioner no. 1 had filed a reminder on 1st
January, 2008 along with medical certificate of Shri Dinesh
Kumar Dwivedi and an affidavit. It is further submitted that
when no action was taken, petitioner no.2 met respondent no.2
personally on 2nd July, 2008 at his office and respondent no.2
orally directed petitioner no. 1 to submit a fresh representation
in respect of the claim of petitioner no. 2 and, thereafter, a fresh
representation dated 5th July, 2008 was submitted by petitioner
no. 1 for appointment of petitioner no.2 on compassionate
11.    Learned counsel for petitioners further submits that once
the initial application has been submitted in the year 1999 and
the respondents after considering the financial condition and
other aspects of the matter has issued the appointment letter in
favour of eldest son of petitioner no.1, who subsequently
became medically unfit, when the appointment letter was
issued, as such the petitioner no.1 by representation had
requested for appointment of petitioner no.2 in place of eldest
son Shri Dinesh Kumar Dwivedi and as such there is no delay
in approaching the respondents for grant of compassionate
12.    It is submitted that the application for compassionate
appointment, which was firstly preferred in the year 1999 was
finally considered by the respondents in 2004 and when the
eldest son of the petitioner no. 1, namely, Shri Dinesh Kumar
Dwivedi could not join on account of his mental condition, an
application was filed to appoint petitioner no.2 in his place and
as such the circumstances in which the petitioner no. 1 was
forced to apply for changing the offer of compassionate
appointment in favour of petitioner no 1, warranted under law
for condonation of delay (if any) in exercise of power under the
proviso to Rule 5 of the Rules of 1974.
13.    It is further submitted that the rejection of the claim of
compassionate appointment of petitioners on the ground of
delay, is arbitrary and untenable under law and without
application of mind. While passing the impugned order, the
authority concerned has not taken into consideration the
aforesaid facts and circumstances which warranted condonation
of delay and further the finding recorded in the impugned order
that the petitioners applied for the first time in the year 2013 is
also dehors the record.
14.    It is further submitted on behalf of petitioners that the
impugned order further rejects the claim of petitioners on the
ground that the petitioners is receiving family pension to the
tune of Rs.7,000/- per month and has income from agricultural
land of Rs.7,700/- per month and as such respondent no.2 has
held that financial condition of the petitioners is not such that
the compassionate appointment may be granted. The respondent
no.2 further by passing impugned order has taken objection to
the marriage of petitioner no.2 during his poor financial
condition and as such has denied compassionate appointment. It
has also been taken note in the impugned order that the
petitioner no.1 is illiterate however, she could have applied for
appointment, as even illiterate persons are being given
appointment on compassionate ground. The impugned order
takes note of the fact that the medical certificate of petitioner
no.1 has not been filed and that the petitioner no. 1 has waited
for the fact that the petitioner no.2 becomes major and
thereafter, has applied for grant of compassionate appointment.
15.    It is submitted that the family pension being given to the
petitioners is not sufficient particularly in view of the fact that
eldest son of petitioner no.1 is suffering from mental illness and
a family of four persons would not survive at a meagre family
pension of Rs.7,000/- per month.
16.    It is further submitted that the agricultural income shown
as Rs.7,700/- per month is dehors the record as there was no
evidence before the respondent authorities which could have
found the basis of the aforesaid income nor any such
documentary evidence was served on the petitioners neither any
opportunity was given prior to determination of the agricultural
income of the petitioners. He submits that initially on the death
of the employee, the petitioner no.1 had given the name of his
eldest son Shri Dinesh Kumar Dwivedi. However, on the date
of issuance of appointment letter in 2004, he was mentally sick
and as such he was not in a position to join the duties and as
such respondents cannot raise objection that petitioner no.1
should have applied for grant of compassionate appointment.
The rules in this respect give a right to any family member to be
appointed on compassionate ground and as such the choice
vests with the petitioners.
17.    It is submitted that finding recorded by the respondent
no.2 that petitioner no. 1 waited for the younger son Manoj
Kumar Dwivedi to become major to apply for compassionate
appointment is not in accordance with law as initially eldest son
had applied for grant of compassionate appointment. However,
he suffered from mental sickness and as such change was
sought and petitioner no.2 was requested to be appointed on
compassionate ground .
18.    Learned Standing Counsel on behalf of the respondents
submits that the husband of petitioner no.1 was posted as
Constable in District Sultanpur, who died on 7th August, 1999
while in service. After the death of the aforesaid employee,
petitioner no.1 applied for appointment of Shri Dinesh Kumar
Dwivedi (eldest son of deceased employee) on compassionate
ground and the Police Head Quarter by order dated 11th
December, 2004 appointed Shri Dinesh Kumar Dwivedi as
Constable (M) with the condition that Dinesh Kumar Dwivedi
will join the Police Training Centre, Moradabad on 15 th
19.    Learned Standing Counsel further submitted that Shri
Dinesh Kumar Dwivedi due to his mental sickness could not
join   for  training. Thereafter, petitioner    no.1 preferred
application for grant of compassionate appointment to
petitioner no.2 in place of Shri Dinesh Kumar Dwivedi. The
aforesaid application remain pending and, therefore, this Court
by order dated 27th August, 2015 passed in Writ-A No.67008 of
2008 directed the respondents to decide the claim of the
petitioners for compassionate appointment within a period of
six weeks from the date of submission of a certified copy of the
order. However, the claim of the petitioners did not find favour
of the authorities concerned and the same was rejected by
means of the impugned order on the ground that the claim was
filed after a period of five years and no ground was
substantiated for condoning the delay in preferring the
application. He submits that the application of the petitioners
have been rightly rejected and the impugned order is in
accordance with law.
20.    Appointment in public service are to be made with open
invitation to all eligible candidates and on merit. In all the
government vacancies equal opportunity should be provided to
all aspirants as mandated under Articles 14 and 16 of the
Constitution. No other mode of appointment nor any other
consideration is permissible. However, appointment on
compassionate ground offered to a dependent of a deceased
employee is an exception to the said norms. The exception is
carved out to meet certain exigencies and in the interest of
justice out of humanitarian consideration. The whole object of
granting compassionate employment is thus to enable the
family to tide over the crisis. The favourable treatment given to
such dependant of the deceased employee in such posts has a
rational nexus with the object sought to be achieved viz. relief
against destitution. The exception to the rule made in favour of
the family of the deceased employee is in consideration of the
services rendered by him and the legitimate expectations, and
the change in the status and affairs, of the family on account of
sudden ending of erstwhile employment.
21.    Appointment on compassionate grounds is not automatic,
but subject to scrutiny of various parameters including the
financial position of the family, the economic dependence of the
family upon the deceased employee. Therefore, no one can
claim to have a vested right for appointment on compassionate
22.    In Malaya Nanda Sethy Vs. State of Orissa and others
passed in Civil Appeal No. 4103 of 2022 [Arising out of S.L.P.
(Civil) No. 936 of 2022] dated 20th May, 2022 has held that
application for compassionate appointment is to be considered
well in time. The consideration must be fair, reasonable and
based on relevant considerations. The application cannot be
rejected on the basis of frivolous and for reasons extraneous to
the facts of the case. Then and then only the object and purpose
of appointment on compassionate grounds can be achieved.
23.    In the present case, husband of petitioner no.1 and father
of petitioner no.2, namely, Late Prem Shankar Dwivedi was a
Constable and he was posted at District - Sultanpur in the year
1999. However, he died on 7.8.1999 during his service while
working on the post of Constable in District - Sultanpur. After
the death of deceased employee, petitioner no.1 submitted a
representation dated 9th September 1999, before the respondent
no.2 and requesting that the petitioner no.1 is an illiterate lady
and, therefore, compassionate appointment may be granted to
her elder son, namely, Dinesh Kumar Dwivedi because there is
no earning member in the family of petitioner no.1 after the
death of her husband.
24.    In pursuance to aforesaid application for grant of
compassionate appointment, respondent no. 2 has issued an
appointment letter dated 11th December, 2004 directing the
appointment of Shri Dinesh Kumar Dwivedi (eldest son of the
deceased employee) on the post of Constable (M) and the
aforesaid appointment letter further provided that Shri Dinesh
Kumar Dwivedi will appear before the Police Training Centre,
Moradabad on 15th December, 2004 for six months training.
25.    Unfortunately, the mental condition of Shri Dinesh
Kumar Dwivedi was very serious on 14th December, 2004 and,
therefore, in place of joining the place of Training Centre,
Moradabad for training on 15th December, 2004, he was
hospitalized at Primary Health Centre, Tarun, Faizabad on 17 th
December, 2004 as he was suffering from mental disease and
was continuously going under treatment. In this respect a
medical certificate dated 17th December, 2007 has been issued
by the In-charge, Medical Officer, Primary Health Centre,
26.    On account of the mental health of elder son of petitioner
no. 1 not been favourable, petitioner no. 1 preferred
representation dated 2nd May, 2006 along with affidavit
informing the respondent authorities that mental health of Shri
Dinesh Kumar Dwivedi have become worst and, therefore,
requested that appointment letter be issued in favour of the
petitioner no. 2 (younger son of petitioner no. 1) on
compassionate ground. The aforesaid representation dated 2nd
May, 2006 further stated that on 15th November, 2005 petitioner
no. 1 had informed the Superintendent of Police, Sultanpur
about the medical condition of Shri Dinesh Kumar Dwivedi and
had further requested for appointment of petitioner no. 2 in
place of Dinesh Kumar Dwivedi.
27.    When the respondents did not take any action on
representation of the petitioner no. 1 for appointment of
petitioner no. 2 in place of Shri Dinesh Kumar Dwivedi, then
the petitioner no. 1 again filed a representation dated 1st
January, 2008 before the respondent no. 2 along with affidavit
and medical certificate of Shri Dinesh Kumar Dwivedi. Despite
the aforesaid representation of the petitioner no. 1, no action
was taken by the respondent authorities and only assurances
were given that the matter would be taken up and the decision
would be communicated. Since no order was being passed on
the above-mentioned representation of the petitioners, the
petitioners met the respondent no. 2 personally on 2nd July, 2008
at Allahabad and the entire grievance was narrated to
respondent no. 2, then respondent no. 2 directed petitioner no. 1
to give a fresh representation along with entire records so that
matter can be considered. On the oral direction of respondents,
the petitioner no. 1 again preferred representation dated 5 th July,
2008 along with affidavit and medical certificate for issuance of
appointment letter in favour of petitioner no. 2 in place of Shri
Dinesh Kumar Dwivedi on compassionate ground.
28.    No action was taken by the respondents on the above-
mentioned representations of petitioner no. 1 and as such the
petitioner no. 1 preferred Writ Petition No 67008 of 2008 (Smt
Gomti Devi Vs State of U.P.) before this Court. The above-
mentioned writ petition was finally decided by judgement and
order dated 27th August, 2012. By order dated 27th August, 2012
this Court directed the respondents to consider the claim for
compassionate appointment of petitioner no. 2 in accordance
with law by a reasoned order within a period of six weeks from
the date of submission of certified copy of the order passed by
29.    The petitioner no. 2 submitted the above-mentioned order
dated 27th August, 2012 before the respondent no. 2 on 24th
September, 2012 along with the covering letter through
registered post. After receiving the certified copy of the order
dated 27th August, 2012, respondent no. 2 has rejected the claim
for compassionate appointment of the petitioner no. 2 by
impugned order dated 28th January, 2015.
30.    The claim for compassionate appointment is governed by
Uttar Pradesh Recruitment of Dependants of Government
Servants Dying in Harness Rules, 1974. The Rule 5 of the
aforesaid Rules of 1974 provides that in case the government
servant dies in harness after the commencement of these Rules
and the spouse of the deceased government servant is not
already employed under the Central Government or a State
Government, one member of his family who is not already
employed under the Central government or a State government
shall on making an application for the purpose be given a
suitable employment in government service on a post. The
aforesaid Rules further provides that the application for
employment shall be made within a period of five years from
the date of death of the government servant. The Rules of 1974
further empower the State Government to relax the requirement
including the time limit where it is satisfied that the time limit
fixed for making application for employment causes undue
hardship in a particular case.
31.    A perusal of the impugned order dated 28th January, 2015
would demonstrate that the application for compassionate
appointment of the petitioner no. 2 was send to the State
Government treating the same to be beyond the five years limit
prescribed in Rule 5 of the Rules of 1974. The respondent no. 2
by impugned order dated 28th January, 2015 rejected the claim
of the petitioner no. 2 for compassionate appointment and
thereby declined to relax the time limit provided in the above-
mentioned Rules of 1974.
32.    The rejection of the claim for compassionate appointment
is made by the respondents on the ground that the deceased
employee expired on 7th August, 1999 and the petitioner no. 1
has applied for appointment on compassionate ground by
application dated 6th May, 2013 after almost 13 years of the
death of the deceased employee. On the aforesaid basis
respondents came to the conclusion that the application for
compassionate appointment was barred by time. Further, the
claim of petitioners has also been rejected on the ground that
the petitioners are getting family pension of Rs. 7000/- per
month and further income from agricultural land to the tune of
Rs. 7700/- per month is being received by the petitioners and as
such the respondents have come to the conclusion that the
family is not in financial crisis. The respondents further taking
note of the fact that the petitioner no. 2 is married and in case
the financial condition of the petitioners’ family was not good
then the petitioner no. 2 would not have married. The impugned
order further states that the petitioner no. 1 has not applied for
compassionate appointment on the ground that she is illiterate
despite the fact that the State Government also provide
employment to illiterate person. The respondents further
recorded that the petitioners have not filed any proof with
regard to ill-health of petitioner no. 1 and petitioner no. 1
waited for petitioner no. 2 to become major and then has
applied for grant of compassionate appointment and on the
aforesaid basis claim of the petitioners for compassionate
appointment has been rejected being filed beyond the time
prescribed under the Rules of 1974.
33.    In the present case, deceased employee expired on 7 th
August, 1999 and application for grant of compassionate
appointment was preferred by petitioner no. 1 on 9 th September,
1999 for appointment of elder son of petitioner no. 1 being Shri
Dinesh Kumar Dwivedi. In the counter affidavit filed by the
respondents in paragraph 10 it has been stated that the claim for
compassionate appointment of the petitioner no. 1 for
appointment of the elder son of petitioner no. 1 was processed
by Superintendent of Police, Sultanpur by communication dated
8th March, 2000 within the time limit prescribed under the 1974
Rules and the appointment letter was issued on 11the
December, 2004 in favour of Shri Dinesh Kumar Dwivedi
(elder son of petitioner no. 1) by the police head quarter.
34.    In pursuance to above-mentioned appointment order
dated 11th December, 2004, Shri Dinesh Kumar Dwivedi could
not join the post on account of his serious mental condition. The
aforesaid fact with regard to Shri Dinesh Kumar Dwivedi not
joining in pursuance to the appointment letter dated 11 th
December, 2004 is admitted by the respondents in the counter
35.    The petitioner no. 1 considering the mental health of Shri
Dinesh Kumar Dwivedi and the fact that he may not be able to
join his post in pursuance to the appointment letter dated 11the
December, 2004 preferred representation dated 2nd May, 2006
along with affidavit before the respondent no. 2 informing
about the ill-health of Shri Dinesh Kumar Dwivedi and further
requesting that the petitioner no. 2 may be appointed in place of
Shri Dinesh Kumar Dwivedi. The aforesaid fact that the
petitioner no. 1 had approach the respondent by representation
dated 2nd May, 2006 has not been denied by the respondents in
the counter affidavit. The representation dated 2 nd May, 2006
further records that on 15th November, 2005, the Superintendent
of Police, Sultanpur was informed about the aforesaid fact.
36.    The petitioner no. 1 thereafter preferred representation
dated 1st January, 2008 before the respondent no. 2 along with
affidavit and medical certificate of Shri Dinesh Kumar Dwivedi
thereby requesting the respondent authorities to issue
appointment letter in favour of petitioner no. 2 as the mental
condition of Shri Dinesh Kumar Dwivedi is not such as would
permit him to join his duties. The aforesaid representation dated
1st January, 2008 is not disputed by the respondents in the
counter affidavit.
37.    Thereafter the petitioner no. 1 has approached the office
of respondent no. 2 and met him personally on 2nd July, 2008 at
Allahabad and has narrated the entire grievance of the
petitioner. The respondent no. 2 had orally directed the
petitioner no. 1 to submit a fresh representation along with the
entire record and as such petitioner no. 1 has filed
representation dated 5th July, 2008 along with medical
certificate of Shri Dinesh Kumar Dwivedi and affidavit and has
further requested for issuance of appointment letter in favour of
petitioner no. 2. The aforesaid representation dated 5 th July,
2008 has not been denied by the respondents in the counter
affidavit. When no action was taken by the respondents on the
representation of the petitioner no. 1, the petitioner no. 1
preferred Writ Petition No. 67008 of 2008 before this Court and
said writ petition was disposed of by order dated 27 th August,
2012 directing the respondents to take decision on the claim for
compassionate appointment of the petitioner no. 2. Thereafter
the claim for compassionate appointment of the petitioner no. 2
has been rejected by the respondent authorities by impugned
order dated 28th January, 2015.
38.    The basis for rejection of the claim of the petitioner no. 2
for grant of compassionate appointment is on account of the
fact that the application for grant of compassionate appointment
was preferred by petitioner no. 1 on 6th May, 2013 whereas the
deceased employee has died on 7th August, 1999. As per the
impugned order, the claim for compassionate appointment was
made by the petitioners beyond the five years limit prescribed
under the Rules of 1974.
39.    The aforesaid ground for rejection of the claim of the
petitioner is untenable in view of the fact that the petitioner no.
1 initially applied for grant of compassionate appointment on 9th
September, 1999 and the aforesaid application of the petitioner
for grant of compassionate appointment was processed by the
respondent authorities and the appointment letter dated 11th
December, 2004 was issued in favour of Shri Dinesh Kumar
Dwivedi (elder son of petitioner no. 1). It is to be noted that
petitioner no. 1 promptly made application for compassionate
appointment on 9th September, 1999 (within a month from the
date of death of the government servant) and the respondents
after almost 4 years proceeded to decide the aforesaid
application for compassionate appointment of the petitioners.
The appointment letter for compassionate appointment was
issued in favour of Shri Dinesh Kumar Dwivedi (elder son of
petitioner no. 1) on 11th Decmeber, 2004, however, during the
intervening period, mental health of Shri Dinesh Kumar
Dwivedi deteriorated and as such, he was not in a position to
join the post as per the appointment letter dated 11 th December,
2004. The petitioner no. 1 thereafter approached the
respondents for issuing appointment letter in favour of
petitioner no. 2 (being the younger son of petitioner no. 1) in
place of Shri Dinesh Kumar Dwivedi. The initial information
with regard to the aforesaid was submitted by the petitioner on
15th November, 2005 and thereafter the representation dated 2nd
May, 2006 along with the affidavit was also submitted before
the respondent authorities. Further representation was also
submitted by the petitioner on 1st January, 2008 and 5th July,
2008. The aforesaid facts have not been disputed by the
respondents in the counter affidavit filed in the present writ
40.    The impugned order takes notice of the application for
grant of compassionate appointment of 6th May, 2013 despite
the fact that prior to the aforesaid application, the petitioner had
already    preferred     the    application   for    compassionate
appointment on 9th September, 1999 which was followed by
issuance of appointment letter on 11th December, 2004 in favour
Dwivedi could not join his duty on account of his mental health
and as such representation dated 2nd May, 2006 was preferred
bringing to the notice of the respondent authorities the ill-health
and mental condition of Shri Dinesh Kumar Dwivedi and
further for issuance of appointment letter in favour of petitioner
no. 2 (younger son of petitioner no. 1). The aforesaid facts have
not been considered by the respondent authorities while passing
the impugned order.
41.    The date of application for compassionate appointment is
recorded in the impugned order as 6th May, 2013 despite the fact
that it is an admitted case of the respondents that the first
application for compassionate appointment was preferred in
1999 itself and thereafter in 2006, the petitioner no. 1 had
requested the change of the name of the beneficiary of
compassionate appointment in place of Shri Dinesh Kumar
Dwivedi who was mentally not of sound mind to join the post
offered. It is also to be noted that the respondent authorities by
order dated 11th December, 2004 has issued appointment letter
in favour of Shri Dinesh Kumar Dwivedi which was after
considering all the aspects with regard to grant of
compassionate appointment.
42.    The petitioner no. 1 had sought replacement of the name
of Shri Dinesh Kumar Dwivedi with the name of petitioner no.
2 on account of unsound mental condition of Shri Dinesh
Kumar Dwivedi. In this respect the petitioners have also filed
medical certificate and affidavit before the respondent
authorities. All these aspects have not been considered by the
respondent authorities while passing the impugned order. The
finding recorded in the impugned order that application for
compassionate appointment has been made on 6th May, 2013 is
not sustainable as it is admitted in the counter affidavit that the
application for compassionate appointment was preferred firstly
in the year 1999 and thereafter in the year 2006 (for
replacement of the name of the beneficiary), as such, the
impugned order insofar it as it rejects the application of the
petitioner as being time barred is not sustainable under law. The
respondents are obliged under law to take a decision
considering all the facts and circumstances of the case and the
non-consideration of the facts herein before stated would make
the impugned order unsustainable under law. The respondent
authorities while passing the impugned order has failed to take
into consideration the important facts which have bearing on
the decision of the respondent authorities.
43.    It is to be noted that the compassionate appointment was
offered by the respondent authorities in pursuance to the
application dated 9th September, 1999 to Shri Dinesh Kumar
Dwivedi, however, he could not join the post on account of his
mental health and as such the petitioner no. 1 sought
replacement of the name of the beneficiary as petitioner no. 2. It
is to be noted that Shri Dinesh Kumar Dwivedi has not joined
his duties in pursuance to the appointment letter dated 11th
December, 2004 and the right of employment on compassionate
ground which stood fortified by issuance of appointment letter
dated 11th December, 2004 has not extinguished on account of
non-joining of Shri Dinesh Kumar Dwivedi on medical grounds
and the subsequent replacement being sought by petitioner no.
1 by requesting for appointment of petitioner no. 2 in place of
Shri Dinesh Kumar Dwivedi was in continuation of the earlier
order dated 11th December, 2004. The aforesaid replacement of
the beneficiary under the compassionate appointment scheme
was being sought on account of the fact that the employee died
in the year 1999 and application for appointment on
compassionate ground was preferred in the year 1999 itself by
petitioner no. 1, however, the respondent authorities issued the
appointment letter on 11th December, 2004 and during the
intervening period subsequent developments have taken place
and as a result of the same, the mental health condition of Shri
Dinesh Kumar Dwivedi was not such as he could have joined
the post in pursuance to the appointment letter dated 11 th
December, 2004 and as such the petitioner no. 1 sought
replacement of the name of beneficiary for grant of
compassionate appointment in favour of the petitioner no. 2.
44.    It is further to be noted that the claim for compassionate
appointment was duly processed and accepted by the
respondent authorities and appointment letter was issued in the
year 2004, however, the acceptance of the compassionate
appointment by the respondents could not be completed by
joining of the beneficiary to the post on the ground of ill-health
and as such although the respondents had issued the
appointment letter, the beneficiary could not join duty and such
peculiar facts and circumstances which have developed after the
filing of the application for compassionate appointment in the
year 1999 was required to be considered by the respondent
authorities while passing the impugned order. The respondent
authority while passing the impugned order has not taken
aforesaid facts and circumstances into consideration and has
passed the order mechanically. Such an approach by the
respondent authorities is counter-productive to the very object
for which the compassionate appointment scheme have been
45.    It is trite in law that facts of a particular case has a
important bearing on the decision to be arrived at. The facts and
particulars are the foundation on which the justice is to be
administered. The administrative authorities while taking a
decision is expected to consider all the material facts and
circumstances to arrive at decision. Non-consideration of any
material facts and circumstances may lead to injustice. The
authority concerned is enjoined with the duty to apply the law
on the facts and circumstances of a particular case while
arriving at a decision. Such an approach is also required to
bring fairness and stability to the decision arrived at by the
administrative authority. Non-consideration of material facts
and circumstances in a particular case may lead the decision as
unfair and untenable under law. It is further to be noted that the
decision-making authority is also a fact-finding authority and as
such is required under law to consider all the facts in proper
perspective so that a fair decision is arrived at by the authority
concerned. Each matter before the administrative authority has
its own peculiar features. The authority concerned is enjoined
with the duty to apply these peculiar facts of the matter to the
law applicable and then recorded finding on the claim before
the aforesaid authority.
46.    The respondent in the impugned order has further
recorded a finding that the petitioners are receiving the family
pension of Rs. 7000/- per month and further has agricultural
income of Rs. 7700/- per month from agricultural land and as
such there is no financial distress to the family of the deceased
employee. It is to be noted that insofar as receiving of the
family pension is concerned, the same was also before the
respondent authorities when the decision for grant of
compassionate appointment was taken in the year 2004 and the
respondent authorities in considering the aforesaid fact of the
matter has granted compassionate appointment to the elder son
of the petitioner no 1. The respondent authorities further has
concluded that the petitioners have agricultural income to the
tune of Rs.7700/- per month. Learned counsel for the
petitioners have disputed the aforesaid fact and has stated that
the petitioners are earning Rs. 20,000/- per year from the
agricultural land. The aforesaid fact has been stated in
paragraph 14 of the writ petition, however, the aforesaid fact
has not been denied in paragraph 18 of the counter affidavit.
The basis on which the respondent authorities have come to the
conclusion that the petitioners have agricultural income to the
tune of Rs.7700/- per month has not been disclosed in the
counter affidavit.
47.    The impugned order is also silent on the basis on which
the authority concerned has come to the conclusion that the
petitioners is having agricultural income to the tune of Rs.
7700/- per month. The authority concerned while arriving at a
decision is required to consider objectively the facts and
circumstances of the case and any finding recorded by the
authority concerned without there being factual foundation as
well as evidence in support of the factual foundation would be
unsustainable in law. The respondents have failed to bring on
record any material to demonstrate as to how the respondents
have come to the conclusion that the petitioners have
agricultural income to the tune of Rs.7700/- per month and as
such the finding of the respondents that the petitioners have
agricultural income to the tune of Rs. 7700/- per month is
wholly unsustainable in law.
48.    It is further to be seen that the impugned order take
notice of the family pension and agricultural income and comes
to the conclusion that the petitioners are not in financial
constraint and as such the compassionate appointment has been
denied. The financial income of the family of a deceased
employee is to be considered by the employer by taking into
consideration whether the aforesaid income is enough to
support the family in a dignified manner. The State is a welfare
State and has duty under the Constitution to safeguard the
interest of a citizen and provide them a dignified life. The
respondent authority by passing the impugned order has not
considered whether a meagre amount of Rs.14,700/- per month
would be enough to support a family member of four persons of
the deceased employee specially in view of the fact that one of
the son of the deceased employee is having mental sickness and
expenditure is being incurred in his well-being. The respondent
authorities while passing the impugned order has not disclosed
the reasons as to why the income of the family has been
considered to be enough to support the family.
49.    The respondent authorities were also required to consider
the expenditure which the family of the deceased employee is
required to incur to maintain the dignified life and should have
objectively considered all the aforesaid aspect of the matter
specifically when the mental health of the elder son of the
deceased employee is not disputed in the counter affidavit filed
by the respondents before this Court.
50.    The respondents in the impugned order has further held
that the petitioner no. 2 is married and in case the family was
suffering from financial constraint then the petitioner no. 2
would not have married. The finding recorded by the
respondents in the impugned order is wholly unsustainable in
law. It is to be noted that the right to marry a person of one’s
own choice is an integral part of Article 21 of the Constitution.
The marriage of a person has no rational nexus with the
financial status of the person. It is to be noted that even a poor
person has a right to marry under the Constitution and the
respondents by passing the impugned order has held that the
petitioner no. 2 is married and in case the financial position of
the petitioners was not good then the petitioner no. 2 would not
have married. The aforesaid finding of connecting the financial
condition with the marriage is having no rational nexus. Even a
poor person can marry despite financial constraint.
51.    Marriage as an institution has great legal significance and
various obligations and duties flow out of marital relationship.
The institutions of marriage is important social institution that
provide for the security, support and companionship of
members of our society and bear an important role in the
rearing of children. Marriage is one of the civil right of an
52.    The civil society is based on the foundation of social
institutions and the cumulative aim of various social institution
is to bring harmony and order in the civil society. The
institution like marriage give recognition to the relationship by
the civil society and law.
53.    The marriage by itself would not denude an individual of
his financial status. The poorest person of the country has a
right to marry while his financial status may remain intact. Any
interpretation by the administrative authorities on the sole
criteria of marriage of an individual denuding the financial
status of the said individual is arbitrary and has no nexus to the
object of compassionate appointment. The financial position of
an individual is to be assessed by the authority concerned on the
settled criteria. The rules of compassionate appointment does
not provide that the marriage of an individual would raise
presumption that the individual has the financial capacity to
support itself. The marital status of the members of the family
may be a factor to consider the number of dependents in the
family or number of bread earners in the family and such an
approach should be considered to determine the financial crisis
of the family of the deceased employee.
54.     The impugned order further takes note that the petitioner
no. 1 could have herself applied for compassionate appointment
even if she is an illiterate person as the State even appoints an
illiterate person. In this respect, it is to be noted that in the year
1999 itself when the deceased employee died, the petitioner no.
1 had applied for grant of compassionate appointment to the
elder son of the petitioner no. 1. The Rules of 1974 provide that
the employment should be granted to one member of the family
of the deceased employee. The petitioner no. 1, therefore, had
applied for appointment of the elder son of petitioner no. 1 for
compassionate appointment, however, he could not joined the
post on account of his mental illness and, therefore, the
petitioner no. 1 had approached the respondent authorities for
replacement      of   the    name     of    beneficiary   under    the
compassionate appointment scheme and the benefit of
compassionate appointment be granted to petitioner no. 2.
55.     It is the choice of the family members of the deceased
employee as to the person who is to be accorded the benefit of
compassionate appointment. Under the facts and circumstances,
petitioners had promptly applied for grant of compassionate
appointment in the year 1999 and decision of granting
compassionate appointment was taken in the year 2004 by the
respondent authorities and as such there was a huge delay on
the part of respondent authorities in addressing the financial
distress of the family of deceased employee and on account of
the aforesaid delay subsequent intervening facts came into
consideration by way of mental illness of elder son of petitioner
no. 1 in respect of which the replacement of the beneficiary was
sought by the petitioner no. 1 from the respondent authorities.
56.    The petitioners have also filed the medical certificate and
affidavit to bring on record facts and circumstances before the
authority concerned. It is further to be noted that affidavit filed
before the authority concerned it is disclosed that the deceased
employee had two sons and one minor daughter and the elder
son of the deceased employee was mentally ill. The aforesaid
facts and circumstances have not been taken into consideration
by the respondent authorities while passing the impugned order.
The financial distress has not been addressed by the respondent
authorities in proper perspective. The liabilities being faced by
the family of the deceased employee on account of sudden
death has not been considered by the respondent authority
specifically the fact that one of the son of the deceased
employee has suffered mental illness after the death of the
employee concerned.
57.    Although,    respondent     authorities  have    positively
considered the application for compassionate appointment and
had offered appointment to the elder son of the petitioner no. 1
in 2004, however, he was mentally unfit when the aforesaid
offer for appointment was made and as such it was the duty of
the respondent authorities to have considered the aforesaid facts
and have offered the replacement. The respondent authorities
while passing the impugned order further has not taken into
consideration the liability that is faced by the family of the
deceased employee on account of the medical treatment of the
elder son of the deceased employee, who is mentally ill. The
respondent authorities have only taken note of the income of
the family of the deceased employee while passing the
impugned order, however, has not dealt with the liability aspect
as to whether the income generated by the family of the
deceased employee is sufficient to meet out the liability of the
family and would permit them to live a dignified life in
consonance with Article 21 of the Constitution of India.
58.    In view of the above-mentioned analysis the impugned
order dated 28th January, 2015 passed by respondent no. 2 is not
sustainable and as such is set aside and the matter is remanded
back to respondent no. 2 to consider the application for
compassionate appointment of petitioner no. 2 on merits and in
accordance with law and in view of the observations made by
this Court hereinabove. In peculiar facts and circumstances of
the case, it is directed that the application for compassionate
appointment shall be considered by the respondents as within
time. The above-mentioned exercise shall be completed by the
respondents within a period of three months from the date of
production of certified copy of the order. The respondents shall
prior to passing of the order shall give an opportunity of hearing
to the petitioners.
59.    As a result the writ petition is allowed with direction as
detailed herein above.
