1.   This Miscellaneous Application has been filed for
clarification of the judgment of this Court dated
27.11.2020 in W.P.(C) No. 804/2020.        Learned Attorney
General for India submitted that the direction given
in   para   53(ii)    of   the    judgment   pertaining  to
constitution of Search-cum-Selection Committee needs
modification. It is submitted that the Secretary to
the Ministry of Law and Justice, Government of India
who   is  made   a  member   of   the  Search-cum-Selection
Committee should be substituted by a Secretary to the
Government     of   India    nominated    by   the  Cabinet
Secretary from a Department other than the parent or
sponsoring department.
2.   Learned Attorney General submitted that there are
19   Tribunals    and  it   will    be  difficult  for  the
Secretary to the Ministry of Law and Justice to act
as a Member of every Search-cum-Selection Committee
which might hinder his other duties.           He suggested
that   the   composition    of   the   Search-cum-Selection
Committee should be changed and the Cabinet Secretary
may be permitted to nominate two Secretaries to the
Government of India from a Department other than the
parent or sponsoring department instead of Secretary
to Ministry of Law and Justice and another Secretary
for a Department other than the parent or sponsoring
department.    Learned Amicus Curiae has no objection
for this modification.      Therefore, the constitution
of  the   Search-cum-Selection   Committee   shall  be  as
(a)      The   Chief  Justice    of  India   or  his
nominee- Chairperson (with a casting vote).
(b)      The out-going Chairman or Chairperson
or President of the Tribunal in case of appointment
of the Chairman or Chairperson or President of the
Tribunal (or) the sitting Chairman or Chairperson or
President of the Tribunal in case of appointment of
other Members of the Tribunal (or) a retired Judge of
the Supreme Court of India or a retired Chief Justice
of a High Court in case the Chairman or Chairperson
or President of the Tribunal is not a Judicial member
or if the Chairman or Chairperson or President of the
Tribunal is seeking re-appointment – Member;
(c)   Two Secretaries to the Government of India
nominated by the Cabinet Secretary from a Department
other   than  the  parent  or   sponsoring   department  –
(d)   Secretary   to   the    sponsoring   or   parent
Ministry or Department – Member Secretary/Convener
(without a vote).
3.  Para   53(vi)    of  the  judgment     dated   27.11.2020
deals    with   the     eligibility     of   Advocates     for
appointment   as   Judicial   Members    in  the   Tribunals.
Advocates with 10 years’ experience were held to be
eligible   for   appointment    as   Judicial    Members   and
entitled for re-appointment for at least one term by
giving preference to the service rendered by them.
The modification sought by learned Attorney General
for India is that instead of the word “entitled”, the
word   “eligible”    may   be  substituted     as   it   would
provide   more   clarity   for   the   Search-cum-Selection
Committee   when    advocates   are    considered    for   re-
appointment.   Mr. Arvind Datar, learned Amicus Curiae
does not have any objection for such modification to
be made.    The last sentence of Para 53(vi) which is
“They shall be entitled for reappointment for at
least one term by giving preference to the
service rendered by them for the Tribunals.”
“They shall be eligible for being considered for
re-appointment for at least one term by giving
preference to the service rendered by them for
the Tribunals.”
4.  Para   53  (xv)    pertains   to   the   tenure    of  the
Chairpersons, Vice Chairpersons and members of the
Tribunals appointed prior to 12.02.2020 which shall
be   governed  by   the   parent   statute    and  Rules.
Learned    Attorney     General     for    India    seeks
clarification of the direction relating to the tenure
of  the  Members  appointed   prior   to  12.02.2020  as,
according to him, Section 184 of the Finance Act,
2017 which has been upheld by this Court in Rojer
Mathew v. South Indian Bank Ltd. reported in (2020) 6
SCC 1, provides that a Member cannot continue beyond
a period of five years. Whereas, on the other hand
certain statutes provide for continuance of a Member
of a Tribunal till he/she attains 62 years.        A list
of 7 Members appointed as Members of the Income Tax
Appellate Tribunal and Central Sales Tax Appellate
Tribunal   has  been   annexed   to   the   Miscellaneous
Application who would have a tenure between 8 years
to 15 years according to the parent statutes and the
Rules.   The learned Attorney General submitted that
the Members cannot have a tenure beyond five years.
5.  We direct the learned Amicus Curiae to submit his
response to the above suggestion made by the learned
Attorney General for India regarding the tenure of
members.
6.  Issue notice to the 7 Members whose names figure
in Annexure-I of the Miscellaneous Application.      They
are permitted to file their response before the next
date of hearing.
7.  If it is not possible to provide housing to the
members of the tribunal, the UOI was directed to pay
an amount of Rs. 1.5 lakhs as HRA to the Chairman &
Vice-Chairman and Rs. 1.25 lakhs per month to the
members  of  the   Tribunals.     The   Learned  Attorney
General submitted that standard HRA for all members
is not appropriate.    Fixation of a static amount may
lead to HRA becoming inadequate after a few years due
to inflation, according to him.       A clarification is
sought  in  respect   of  Para   53 (v)   by  fixing  HRA
payable to members at twice the HRA payable to the
Secretary to Government of India.
8.  The  UOI  is   directed   to  place   on  record  the
particulars of the members of the Tribunals working
in X, Y, Z cities/towns and the amounts paid to them
as HRA.  Details of the accommodation provided to the
members of the Tribunal shall also be provided.       The
UOI shall submit a proposal as to what amount would
be  reasonable   towards   HRA   in  case   accommodation
cannot be provided to members of the Tribunal.
