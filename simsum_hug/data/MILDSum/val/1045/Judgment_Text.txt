Counsel for Revisionist :- Irfan Raza Khan,Sr. Advocate
Counsel for Opposite Party :- G.A.
1.       Heard Sri Irfan Raza Khan, learned counsel for revisionist, Sri
L.D. Rahbhar, learned A.G.A. for the State and perused the record.
2.       The instant revision has been preferred against the impugned
order dated 11.11.2021 passed by learned Special Chief Judicial
Magistrate, Agra by which the application of the revisionist/applicant for
release of Vehicle No. Eicher Canter DL 1 GC 5909 in Case Crime No. 36
of 2021, under Sections 3/5A/8 Prevention of Cow Slaughter Act, Police
Station- Saiyan, District- Agra was rejected.
3. The brief facts necessary for disposal of this case are that on
24.03.2021 Sub-Inspector Virendra Kumar along with his companion
Constables Lalit Kumar, Ravi Kant Yadav and Saurabh Kumar and Driver
Brij Kumar proceeded from Police Station Sainya vide entry in general
diary report no. 27 at about 14:10 hours and were busy in patrolling duty
and when they reached at Saiyan crossing they were informed by the
informer that a red colour Tata Eicher Canter loaded with banned cow
skin was coming from the side of Dhaulpur, Rajasthan to Agra. On the
information, Sub-Inspector Virendra Kumar started checking the vehicles
by putting barrier near Saiyan Toll for apprehending the aforesaid Canter
and tried to take public witnesses, but none agreed to testify, under that
compulsion the police party searched each other and no incriminating
articles was found from any members of the police party. As soon as the
informer saw the red colour Tata Eicher Canter bearing Registration No.
DL 1 GC 5909, he pointed out the police party and left from the place,
thereafter, the policemen signalled the driver of the aforesaid Canter to
stop the vehicle. On seeing the police party, the driver stopped the
aforesaid vehicle some distance ahead and started turning back the
Canter in a hurry, then the police party convinced that there were
definitely some illegal goods in the Canter and they apprehended the
driver who told his name as Akash son of Man Singh, resident of
Firozabad and present address Tyagi Chaupal near Chhatarpur Temple,
Police Station- Mehrauli, New Delhi and he also told that his permanent
address is village Jarar, Police Station- Wah, District- Agra and told that
he is aged about 24 years. On his personal search, a mobile phone of
OPPO company was recovered from the right pocket of his trousers. The
IMEI numbers of the phone was obtained as (1) 863885033196312 (2)
863885033196304 and Rs. 3100/-and an Aadhar Card in the name of
Akash Pratiman Singh resident of Mohalla- Mahteli Gali, Shikohabad,
District Firozabad were also recovered from him. On being asked about
the reason for turning the vehicle back, he told that the vehicle was
loaded with cow skin on which the policemen removed the Tripal and
found 145 bundles of cow skin from which smell of rotten meat was
coming out and Dr. Mahendra Verma, Veterinary Medical Officer,
Saiyan, Agra was asked to come at the spot over phone who came there
in no time and after closely checking he told that the bundles of the skin
loaded in the Canter is the skin of cow and took three pieces of skin from
different bundles for sample which were separately kept in three jars
and sealed and sample seal was prepared. The accused Akash could not
produce the papers of the vehicle, therefore, the aforesaid vehicle was
seized under Section 207 of Motor Vehicle Act and the accused was
arrested after informing him that his act is punishable under Sections
3/5Ka/8 of Uttar Pradesh Cow Slaughter (Prevention) Act. The recovery
memo was prepared on the spot by Sub-Inspector Virendra Singh and
companion police constables and Dr. Mahendra Verma. On the basis of
recovery memo, Case Crime No.0036 of 2021, under Sections 3/5Ka/8
was registered against the accused/Driver Akash, later on who was
released by the coordinate Bench of this Court vide order dated
31.08.2021 passed in Criminal Misc. Bail Application No. 24517 of
2021 (Akash vs. State of UP).
4.      The revisionist is owner of the aforesaid Vehicle No. Eicher DL
1 GC 5909 who moved an application for the release of aforesaid Canter
which was rejected by learned Special Chief Judicial Magistrate, Agra
vide impugned order dated 11.11.2021.
5.      Feeling aggrieved by the aforesaid impugned order, the
revisionist has preferred this revision and has filed the photocopy of e-
Way Bill System as Annexure No.3, Registration Certificate of Canter
Wheelers Package Policy-Zone A (Annexure No.4), Bill of Supply in
favour of Maaz Traders, Mohalla- Peer Khan Soldpur Road, Gulaathi
(BSR) Uttar Pradesh issued by Maharashtra Leather Merchant dated
22.03.2021 (annexure no.5), Extract of Uttar Pradesh Prevention of Cow
Slaughter Act (annexure no.6), copy of NPPA document (annexure no.7),
photocopy of certified copy of impugned order dated 11.11.2021 passed
by Special Chief Judicial Magistrate, Agra in Case Crime No. 36 of
2021, under Sections 3/5A/8 Prevention of Cow Slaughter Act, P.S.
6.      Learned counsel for the revisionist has submitted that the lower
court has illegally held that in view of the law laid down by this Court in
“Yaash Mohammad vs. State of Uttar Pradesh and Others, reported in
2021 SCC Online Allahabad 608” that the Canter was seized under
special criminal act and it has no jurisdiction to release the Canter under
Sections 451, 452, 457 of Code of Criminal Procedure and has rejected
his release application. It is further submitted that the facts of the
aforesaid case referred by learned lower court while rejecting the
application do not apply in this case. Learned counsel has submitted that
this Court in Criminal Misc. Application No. 20507 of 2008 (Mohd.
Haneef vs. State of UP and Others) decided on 08.01.2010 relying upon
the order passed by this Court dated 06.01.2005 in Criminal Revision
No. 23 of 2005, the skin to be released in favour of the accused-
revisionist wherein it is also held that “A perusal of above order passed
in Criminal Revision goes to show that 456 pieces of leather were
recovered from possession of one Babu and a case under Section 3/5/8
of Cow Slaughter Act was registered. The applicant/revisionist who is
the owner of above leather, approached the lower court for release of the
above leather pieces, which was rejected by the court below. The
submission was made by the learned counsel for the revisionist in that
case that no offence under section 3/5/8 of Cow Slaughter Act was made
out as the leather pieces were recovered and the recovery of said leather
pieces was not an offence under the Act and only slaughtering and
keeping the beef is an offence under the Cow Slaughter Act. Considering
the facts and circumstances of the case and without going into the merits
of the same, this Court allowed the said revision and directed the
Magistrate to release 456 pieces of leather in favour of the revisionist.”
7.       In view of above analogy, this Court had allowed the application
under Section 482 Cr.P.C. in Mohd. Haneef vs. State of UP and others
(supra). Learned counsel for revisionist has submitted that on the above
anology and the above law laid down by this Court, the impugned order
dated 11.11.2021 passed by learned Special Chief Judicial Magistrate,
Agra in in Case Crime No. 36 of 2021 (State vs. Manjeet Tanwar) is
liable to be quashed and the lower court may be directed to release the
aforesaid Eicher Canter bearing Registration No. DL 1 GC 5909 in
favour of revisionist/applicant.
8.       It has been further submitted by learned counsel for revisionist
that Section 2 (a) which deals definition read as follows:-
“In this act, unless there is anything repugnant in the subject to
context- (a) ‘Beef’ means flash of cow but does not include such
flesh contained in sealed containers and imported as such in Uttar
9.       It is further submitted that leather does not fall within the
definition of ‘Beef’, therefore, Canter cannot be seized under Prevention
of Cow Slaughter Act. It is further submitted that the aforesaid Canter
was transporting the leather skins of cow which is not prohibited by the
provisions of Cow Slaughter Act. In above circumstances, learned lower
court has illegally held that it was contravention of cow slaughter and it
has no jurisdiction to release the Canter.
10.       Learned A.G.A. has opposed the release of the vehicle Eicher
Canter bearing Registration No. DL 1 GC 5909 and submitted that
learned lower court has rightly held that it has no jurisdiction to decide
the release application of the revisionist/applicant and rejected the
release application according to law vide impugned order dated
11.11.2021 which requires no interference by this Court.
11.       I have given thoughtful consideration to the contentions raised
by learned counsel for the applicant as well as learned A.G.A. In this
case, it is admitted to the parties that the Eicher Canter DL 1 GC 5909 is
seized in Crime No. 36 of 2021, under Section 3/5A/8 of Uttar Pradesh
Cow Slaughter Act. It is also admitted to the parties that the revisionist is
the registered owner of the aforesaid vehicle. Now, the question arose
whether transportation of leather skin outside the State is contravening
the provisions of Cow Slaughter Act as amended from time to time:-
“Section 3. Prohibition of Cow Slaughter.- No person shall
slaughter or cause to be slaughtered, or offer or cause to be offered
for slaughter, a cow, bull or bullock in any place in Uttar Pradesh,
anything contained in any other law for the time being in force or

(3) Where the person transporting a cow, bull or bullock on a

shall be deemed to have contravened the provision of sub-section
(4) The form of permit, the form of application therefor and the
procedure for disposal of such application shall be such as may be
(5) The State Government or any officer authorised by it in this
behalf by general or special notified order, may, at any time, for the
purpose of satisfying itself, or himself, as to the legality or propriety
of the action taken under this section, call for and examine the

deem fit.
(6) Where the said conveyance has been confirmed to be related to
beef by the competent authority or authorised laboratory under this
Act, the driver, operator and owner related to transport, shall be
charged with the offence under this Act, unless it is not proved that
the transport medium used in crime, despite all its precautions and
without its knowledge, has been used by some other person for
causing the offence.
(7) The vehicle by which the beef or cow and its progeny is
transported in violation of the provisions of this Act and the
relevant rules, shall be confiscated and seized by the law
enforcement         officers.       The        concerned         District
Magistrate/Commissioner of Police will do all proceedings of
confiscation and release, as the case may be.
(8) The cow and its progeny or the beef transported by the seized
vehicle shall also be confiscated and seized by the law enforcement
officers. The concerned District Magistrate/ Commissioner will do
all proceedings of the confiscation and release, as the case may be.
(9) The expenditure on the maintenance of the seized cows and its
progeny shall be recovered from the accused for a period of one
year or till the release of the cow and its progeny in favour of the
owner thereof whichever is earlier.
(10) Where a person is prosecuted for committing, abetting, or
attempting to an offense under Sections 3, 5 and 8 of this Act and
the beef or cow-remains in the possession of accused has been
proved by the prosecution and transported things are confirmed to
be beef by the competent authority or authorised laboratory, then
the court shall presume that such person has committed such
offence or attempt or abetment of such offence, as the case may be,
unless the contrary is proved.
(11) Where the provisions of this Act or the related rules in context
of search, acquisition, disposal and seizure are silent, the relevant
provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 shall be
effective thereto.
5B- Insertion of Section 5B-. Whoever causes any physical injury
to any cow or its progeny so as to endanger the life thereof such as
to mutilate its body or to transport it in any situation whereby
endangering the life thereof or with the intention of endangering the
life thereof does not provide with food or water shall be punished
with imprisonment for a term which shall not be less than one year
and which may extend to seven years and with fine which shall not
be less than one Lakh rupees and which may extend to three Lakh
rupees.
8. Amendment of section 8- (1) Whoever contravenes or attempts
to contravene or abets the contravention of the provisions of Section
3, Section 5 or Section 5-A shall be guilty of an offence punishable
with rigorous imprisonment for a term which shall not be less than
three years and which may be extend to ten years and with fine
which shall not be less than three Lakh rupees and which may
extend to five Lakh rupees.
(2) Whoever after conviction of an offence under this Act is again
guilty of an offence under this Act, shall be punished with double

(3) The names and the photograph of the person accused of the
contravention of the provision of Section 5-A shall be published at
some prominent place in locality where the accused ordinarily
resides or to a public place, if he conceals himself from the law
enforcement officers.”
12.      From perusal of Section 5A Cow Slaughter Act, it is very much
clear that there is no contravention of transportation of cow skin leather
from    outside      of   the   State.   In    such     a   matter,    the   District
Magistrate/Commissioner of the Police has no jurisdiction to confiscate
such vehicle in the event of seizure of vehicle by law enforcement
officer. This Court in Criminal Revision No. 23 of 2005 had held that
transport of cow skin leather does not amount any contravention of
provisions of Cow Slaughter Act which is followed by this Court in
Criminal Misc. Application No.20507 of 2008 (Mohd. Haneef vs. State
of UP and others decided on 08.01.2010).
13.      In above circumstances, the Judicial Magistrate has jurisdiction
to release the Canter DL1GC5909 as being the case property. The ruling
of Single Bench of this Court in Yaash Mohammad vs. State of UP
(supra) on which learned lower court has relied and held that the lower
court has no jurisdiction to release the Canter in question is not
applicable in this case because in the aforesaid case the application for
the release of vehicle was rejected on the ground that the cow or its
progeny was transported in contravention of Section 5A of Uttar Pradesh
Cow Slaughter Act regarding which special provisions were prescribed
and only District Magistrate/Commissioner of the Police was authorised
to pass order for confiscation in the event of seizure of cow or its
progeny and transport medium.
14.      It is further provided that in case where the provisions of this
Act or the related rules in context of such, acquisition, disposal and
seizure are silent, the provision of Criminal Procedure Code, 1973 shall
be affected thereto.
Section 5A (11) of Cow Slaughter Act reads as follows:-
“5A(11). Where the provision of this Act or the related rules in
context of such, acquisition, disposal and seizure are silent, the
provision of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 shall be effective
thereto.”
15.      From above discussion, it is, prima facie, established that the
skin leather of cow was not transported in contravention of the
provisions of Cow Slaughter Act or rule of Uttar Pradesh Cow Slaughter
Rules. In above circumstances, the Special Magistrate, Agra has
jurisdiction to decide the release of the vehicle in question by which the
skin leather of cow or its progeny was transported. Learned Magistrate
has    jurisdiction     to   decide     the   release    application       of the
revisionist/applicant and learned lower court has illegally held that he
has no jurisdiction to hear on the release application of Canter
DL1GC5909, hence, the revision is liable to be allowed and order of the
lower court is liable to be set-aside.
16.      Accordingly, the criminal revision is allowed. The impugned
order dated 11.11.2021 passed by Special Chief Judicial Magistrate,
Agra is set-aside and learned Special Chief Judicial Magistrate, Agra is
directed to decide the release application of applicant within a period of
one month from the date of production of the certified copy of this order.
