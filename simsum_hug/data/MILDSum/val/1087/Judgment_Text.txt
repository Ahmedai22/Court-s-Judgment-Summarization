The petitioner is before this Court calling in question
proceedings in Special C.C.No.188 of 2022 arising out of crime
No.70 of 2021 registered for offences punishable under Section
376(2)(i)(n) of the IPC and Sections 5(j)(ii), 5(l) and 6 of the
Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012 (for short
2. Heard Sri V.Manjunath, learned counsel appearing for
the  petitioner   and   Sri K.S.Abhijith,  learned   High Court
Government Pleader appearing for respondent No.1.
CRL.P No. 6789 of 2022
3. Facts that lead the petitioner to this Court, succinctly
stated, are as follows:-
Petitioner is the accused, a man of 45 years working as a
Conductor with the KSRTC. A crime comes to be registered on
19-02-2021 by the 2nd respondent, father of the victim.       The
allegation against the petitioner is that the daughter of the
complainant who was 12 years old had become pregnant. The
reason for pregnancy is the act of the petitioner/accused who is
a relative of the family of the complainant. It is the allegation
that on the night of 05-01-2021 the petitioner had indulged in
sexual act with the victim and on 17-02-2021 the victim had
developed nausea which necessitated the complainant to take
her to the doctor and then comes to know that his daughter is
pregnant and the reason for pregnancy is the petitioner. The
crime then comes to be registered on the complaint of the 2nd
respondent in crime No.70 of 2021 for the afore-quoted
offences. Since the victim was 12 years old, foetus had to be
removed and sent for DNA analysis. The blood sample of the
petitioner was also sent along for the analysis. The report of
the DNA sample that was sent for analysis was yet to come
CRL.P No. 6789 of 2022
about. The police, however, after investigation filed a charge
sheet in the matter pending receipt of the report of the DNA
4. When the proceedings in terms of the charge sheet
filed in Special C.C.No.188 of 2022 was in progress, the report
of DNA comes about and the report of the DNA was in favour of
the petitioner, opining that the DNA sample of the foetus did
not match with the blood sample of the petitioner. The
petitioner on receipt of DNA report rushes to this Court with the
subject petition, contending that he was not responsible for the
daughter of the complainant becoming pregnant.
5. The learned counsel appearing for the petitioner
elaborating the DNA report would contend that no such act had
happened on the victim and if at all it had happened, the DNA
sample of the foetus should have matched with that of the
petitioner. Since DNA report is negative, no offence can be
made out against the petitioner and, therefore, the proceedings
are to be terminated.
6. On the other hand, the learned High Court Government
Pleader placing reliance on the entire records of the case would
submit that Section 164 CrPC statement rendered by the victim
is clear as to what acts the petitioner had indulged in and,
therefore, it would become a matter for trial for the petitioner
to come out clean, notwithstanding the report of the DNA being
in favour of the petitioner.
7.  I   have   given   my  anxious  consideration   to the
submissions made by the respective learned counsel and
perused the material on record.
8. The afore-narrated facts are not in dispute.        The
incident is alleged to have happened at 12.30 a.m. on
05-01-2021. It is the said incident that becomes the fulcrum of
allegations against the petitioner. The incident narrated in the
complaint is that when all the members of the family were
asleep in the house of the victim where the petitioner was also
sleeping, the aunt of the victim walks out and goes to use the
washroom for a considerable time. Between the time the aunt
of the victim going to the wash room and coming back, the
CRL.P No. 6789 of 2022
petitioner is alleged to have indulged in sexual assault on the
12 year old victim. This fact was known to none.
9. On 17-02-2021 the victim develops nausea and begins
to regurgitate and was later taken to the hospital where the
Doctor on examination finds the victim to be pregnant of 7 to 8
weeks by then. Therefore, the alleged act of the petitioner is
said to have resulted in the victim getting pregnant of about 7
to 8 weeks as on 20-02-2021. Since the victim was 12 years
old, the pregnancy had to be medically terminated and MTP
was carried out on the victim and while doing so, the sample of
the foetus in the womb was taken and sent for DNA analysis
along with the blood sample of the petitioner.
10. The Police, who were investigating into the crime that
had been registered against the petitioner, filed charge sheet
without waiting for DNA report invoking the aforementioned
Sections. The report of the DNA comes during the pendency of
the proceedings before the Special Court and the report depicts
that the sample sent was negative to the sample of the
petitioner. The report reads as follows:

Duration of Examination:29.05.2021 to 27.04.2022.
1. Due care taken for the integrity of the sample by
coding and decoding.
2 The DNA was extracted from the source of sample
sent.
3. The DNA was quantified from the above sample and
then amplified by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
using VersaPlex TM         27PY system PCR Amplification kit
containing primers for 23 STR loci, gender marker
Amelogenin and three Y-Specific Loci. The PCR products
were separated on Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems
Inc.) 3500 XL and analyzed using GeneMapper TM ID-X
CRL.P No. 6789 of 2022
Software v1.6 to generate allele profile. The DNA profile
resides for the samples are shown in the enclosed table as
4. The following loci were examined D3S1358: DIS1656,
D2S1338. CSEIPO, Penta D. THOI, vWA, D21S11, D7S820,
D2251045, FGA. gender marker Amelogenin and three Y-
Specific loci DYS391. DYS576 and DYS570.
From the comprehensive analysis of the test
results as shown in Annexure I it is found that:
1. The alleles in the DNA profile result of product
of conception, sent in item no.I is consistent with
having come from the offspring of victim and
matching with that of the alleles in the DNA profile
result of sample blood son in item no. 2, under 23
STR (short tandem repeats) loci.
2. In the DNA profile of product of conception, sent in
item no.1, the alleles present in the loci DIS1358,
Penta D, D8S1179, D12S391 and D22S1045 are not
matching with that of the alleles present in the DNA
profile of Swamy s/o Late Basavaraju, sample blood sent
in item no.3, under 23 STR (short tanden repeats) loci
As per the international guidelines, the situation in
which the father is lacking an allele of a system that ought
to have been contributed to the child and the situation in
which the child lacks either of the alleles of a system
present in the alleged father are instances of "definite
exclusion of a father from the paternity of the child‚Äù.
From the DNA profile results of the samples sent,
CRL.P No. 6789 of 2022
1. The product of conception, sent in item no. I is
of human origin and female sex.
2. The DNA profile result of product of conception,
sent in item no. 1 is matching with the DNA profile
results of victim, sample blood sent in item no. 2.
3. The DNA profile result of product of conception.
sent in item no. 1 is not matching with the DNA
profile results of Swamy s/o Late Basavaraju, sample
blood sent in item no. 3.
Therefore, victim, sample blood sent in item no.2
is included from being the biological mother and
Swamy S/o Late Basavaraju, sample blood sent in
item no.3 is excluded form being the biological father
of the product of conception, sent in item no.1.
The opinion of the analyst was that the petitioner was excluded
being the biological father of the product of conception and the
victim was included being the biological mother. The product of
conception did not match with the DNA profile result of the
petitioner i.e., the blood sample that was sent for analysis.
11. It is no doubt true that DNA analysis has emerged in
favour of the petitioner, for him not being the biological father.
That would not, in the considered view of this Court, absolve
the petitioner in entirety for the offences so alleged. Paternity
CRL.P No. 6789 of 2022
may have been in doubt due to the analysis. The alleged act
has not at all happened cannot be the inference that can be
drawn due to a DNA sample coming in favour of the petitioner.
Even otherwise, the DNA sample report that is given by the
analyst is also to be confirmed by way of evidence. Mere
production of DNA sample report before this Court would not
mean that it has to be taken as gospel truth without
examination or cross-examination of the doctor who has
rendered such opinion.
12. It is germane to notice the statement of the victim
girl as recorded under Section 164 of the Cr.P.C.                             The victim
narrates the horrendous acts of the petitioner, a 45 year old
man on a 12 year old child.                  Section 164 Cr.P.C. statement
reads as follows:

If what the 12 year old child narrates before the learned
Magistrate, as quoted hereinabove, is taken note of, they are
all unpardonable acts on the part of the petitioner unless
proved otherwise. The DNA test would exclude the petitioner as
father of the child, but cannot discredit what the victim has
narrated in her 164 Cr.P.C. statement that the petitioner had
forcibly committed sexual acts on her. There is no reason to
disbelieve the testimony of the victim as narrated in the said
statement.         The DNA test cannot be said to be a conclusive
evidence with regard to the allegations made against the
petitioner. The DNA test can at best be used as a corroborative
evidence. Reference being made to the judgment of the Apex
CRL.P No. 6789 of 2022
Court   in   the   case  of SUNIL       V. STATE      OF    MADHYA
PRADESH1 in the circumstances would be apposite. The Apex
Court has held as follows:
‚Äú4. From the provisions of Section 53-A of the
Code and the decision of this Court in Krishan Kumar
[Krishan Kumar Malik v. State of Haryana, (2011) 7 SCC
130 : (2011) 3 SCC (Cri) 61] it does not follow that failure
to conduct the DNA test of the samples taken from the
accused or prove the report of DNA profiling as in the
present case would necessarily result in the failure of the
prosecution case. As held in Krishan Kumar [Krishan
Kumar Malik v. State of Haryana, (2011) 7 SCC 130 :
(2011) 3 SCC (Cri) 61] (para 44), Section 53-A really
‚Äúfacilitates the prosecution to prove its case‚Äù. A
positive result of the DNA test would constitute
clinching evidence against the accused if, however,
the result of the test is in the negative i.e. favouring
the accused or if DNA profiling had not been done in
a given case, the weight of the other materials and
evidence on record will still have to be considered.
It is to the other materials brought on record by the
prosecution that we may now turn to.‚Äù
(Emphasis supplied)
In the light of the judgment rendered by the Apex Court in the
case of SUNIL (supra), the unmistakable inference would be, if
a positive result of the DNA comes about against the accused,
it would constitute a clinching evidence against him for further
proceeding.      If the result is negative i.e., favouring the
CRL.P No. 6789 of 2022
accused, then the weight of other materials and evidence on
record will still have to be considered for corroboration.
Therefore, it does not form such a clinching evidence that
would result in termination of proceedings against the accused,
the petitioner in the case at hand.
13. Finding no merit, the Criminal Petition is dismissed.
Consequently, I.A.No.1/2022 also stands dismissed.
