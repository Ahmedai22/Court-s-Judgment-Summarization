No one has appeared on behalf of the Respondent No.2 in spite
of notice.
This appeal is against an order dated 24.11.2021 passed by the
High Court of Punjab and Haryana at Chandigarh dismissing Criminal
Misc. No.33701/2021 in Criminal Miscellaneous Petition No. 33995 of
2021 filed by the Appellant for permission to travel back to the
United              States  of  America,   where     he    has a job, and  resume his
duties.
The short question in this appeal is, whether the Appellant
can be denied his fundamental right of personal liberty to travel
abroad, subject to possession of a valid passport, visa and other
requisite travel documents, only because he is arrayed as accused
in a complaint filed by his brother’s wife against his brother
being the husband of the complainant and his parents, particularly
mother and that too when the allegations in the complaint do not
disclose any criminal offence on the part of the Appellant.                       The
answer to the aforesaid question has to be in the negative.
The Appellant is the brother-in-law (husband’s brother) of the
Respondent No.2 (hereinafter referred to as the “complainant”). The
Appellant is employed in Texas in the United States of America.
The   complainant   Annupriya      Sharma,     a permanent   resident  of
Kurukshetra was married to Nitin Sharma, brother of the Appellant,
according to the Hindu rites and customs on 20.01.2019.
On  03.02.2019,   the    complainant’s       husband  went  back  to  the
United States of America, where he had been working. On 16.02.2019,
the complainant left for the United States of America, to join her
husband.   She had to travel alone.
The complainant has stated that the said Nitin Sharma had been
working as Application Engineer in a Multinational Company NOVOPLM
(SCONCE), and had been residing in the United States of America
since 2009 on H1B-Visa.       The said Nitin Sharma apparently resides
at Charlotte in North Carolina, as would be evident from the array
of accused persons in the complaint.
It   appears   that    there     were     differences   and   matrimonial
disputes   between  the   complainant       and   her husband   Nitin  Sharma,
brother of the Appellant from the inception of their marriage.
According to the complainant she was also harassed for dowry by her
parents-in-law, particularly mother-in-law.
On 16.08.2019, the complainant returned to India, allegedly at
the behest of her in-laws.           In November 2019, the complainant’s
parents-in-law returned to India. After the complainant’s parents-
in-law returned, the complainant and her parents tried to contact
them and also tried to contact the complainant’s husband Nitin
Sharma. The complainant’s in-laws tried to avoid the complainant
and her parents on one pretext or the other and the complainant’s
husband Nitin Sharma did not answer their calls. The complainant
was not allowed to live in her matrimonial home at Faridabad.
On 07.09.2020, an FIR was filed by the complainant against her
husband and in-laws under Sections 323, 34, 406, 420, 498A and 506
of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 was registered at the Thanesar City
Police Station at Kurukshetra under Section 154 of the Criminal
Procedure Code, 1973.    The complainant’s husband Nitin Sharma, her
father-in-law, Suresh Chand Sharma, her mother-in-law, Satyawati
Sharma and the Appellant were arrayed as Accused Nos. 1, 2, 3 and 4
In a nutshell, the material allegations in the FIR were:
(i) The accused pressurized the complainant’s family to organise
the marriage ceremony of the complainant and the said Nitin
Sharma (Accused No.1) at Faridabad instead of Kurukshetra. As
ceremonies/functions   were     held    at  Kurukshetra   and   Faridabad
complainant’s parents incurred expenditure of Rs.23 lakhs.
(ii) The complainant’s mother-in-law (Accused No.3) had demanded
gold ornaments of her choice, saying that her elder daughter-
in-law had brought 70 tolas of gold.
(iii)   After   marriage     the     complainant’s       in-laws    expressed
dissatisfaction over the dowry brought by her.            Her mother-in-
law (Accused No.3) taunted her for bringing less dowry.
(iv) The complainant’s mother in law (Accused No.3) insulted the
complainant  even   more   after     a   cousin   of  the  complainant’s
husband,  whose   marriage     took     place   three   days   after  the
complainant  got   married,     was    gifted   a  car  by   the  bride’s
family.    It is alleged that the complainant’s mother-in-law
(Accused No.3) demanded a car.
(v) The complainant’s husband (Accused No.1) was not interested in
her and found excuses to harass her.           He returned home late in
an inebriated state and fought with her without reason.             After
watching television till late at night, he slept on the couch.
(vi) The complainant's husband (Accused No.1) did not allow her to
go  out  of  the  Apartment.        He    did  not  arrange   for  social
security,   health   insurance       or     driving   licence   for   the
complainant.   He also did not allow her to obtain the same on
her own.
(vii) The complainant’s husband (Accused No.1) made the complainant
dependent   on him  even   for    small     things.    He  did  not  give
attention to her health, and smoked at home and also stocked
non-vegetarian   food    in     the    refrigerator,     though,   before
marriage, he had told her that he was a vegetarian and a non-
smoker. The complainant’s husband (Accused No.1) twisted her
arms when she tried to stop him from smoking.
(viii) On the pretext of going to play cricket, the complainant’s
husband left the house early and returned at 3 o’clock at
night.   She suspected he was living with a lady, after she
found lease documents in a closet. When the complainant asked
her husband(Accused No.1) about the lease documents, he left
the apartment without giving any answer.             He had been in a
live-in relationship with a woman before marriage.              This had
not been disclosed to the complainant.
(ix) On one occasion, after the complainant’s husband (Accused No.
1)   had    intoxicated    himself      with     weed   (Marijuana),   the
complainant     found weed pipe in her husband’s pocket.              When
she told this to her brother-in-law (the Appellant) and his
wife,   the   complainant’s     husband     (Accused  No.1)   abused  her,
pushed her and twisted her arm.
(x) The complainant’s husband (Accused No.1) tortured and harassed
her with a view     to make her leave or to compel her to commit
suicide.
(xi) In June 2019, the complainant’s parents-in-law (Accused Nos.2
and 3) went to U.S.A. Instead of solving the complainant’s
problems, they both (Accused Nos. 2 and 3) started harassing
(xii)  The   complainant’s    mother-in-law       (Accused    No.3)  gave  the
complainant stale food and scolded her without reason.                When
the complainant protested, her husband (Accused No.1) rebuked
her for raising her voice in front of her parents-in-law and
insulting them.
(xiii) The complainant’s husband’s family told the complainant to
go   to   India,   so   that     they      could   reform   her   husband.
Accordingly, she came to India in August, 2019.
(xiv) When the complainant’s parents-in-law returned to India in
November, 2019 the complainant and her parents tried to contact
them (Accused Nos. 2 and 3) and also tried to contact the
complainant’s    husband    (Accused       No.1).      The   complainant’s
parents-in-law (Accused Nos. 2 and 3) avoided the complainant
and her parents, giving excuses, and the complainant’s husband
(Accused No.1) did not take calls.
(xv) The   complainant’s   parents-in-law         (Accused   Nos.2   and   3)
insulted the complainant’s parents when they went to visit the
complainant’s   parents-in-law       and    they   did  not   allow   the
complainant to live in her matrimonial home at Faridabad.            They
made it clear that the complainant would be allowed to stay in
her matrimonial home in Faridabad and           be sent to USA only if
their dowry demands were satisfied.
(xvi) The accused have collectively ruined the complainant’s life
by falsely representing that the complainant’s husband(Accused
No.1) was a vegetarian, a teetotaller and non-smoker, when in
fact he was a non-vegetarian, a chain smoker and an alcoholic
and also by suppressing his live-in relationship with another
woman.
In the entire complaint there is no specific complaint against
the Appellant.   The only allegations against the Appellant are:
“My mother-in-law and my brother-in-law have taken all
gold and have kept with them. I went to USA with one
Mangal Sutra and Chain.
I am religious and vegetarian, which was known to
Nitin. For the purpose of harassing me, he used to
stock non-veg in the refrigerator.            Before marriage,
he himself stated that he is non-smoker, non-drinker
and vegetarian, whereas truth was against this. He
used to take intoxicated materials. One time, I found
weed pipe from his pocket. When this fact was brought
into the notice of my brother-in-law, he instead asked
me to accept the culture of Nitin.
One day, Nitin came after doing intoxication (weed
marijuana), I thought that I found weed pipe earlier
from his pocket and he may not have the habit of weed,
then I told about this to his brother and sister-in-
law. On this Nitin started abusing and pushed me while
twisting my arm and he had been playing psychological
game and had been torturing and harassing, so that
either I myself leave him or commit suicide.                     My
brother-in-law threatened me to remain quiet otherwise
Nitin is a very bad enemy.”
The allegations in the complaint against the Appellant prima
facie do not disclose, against the Appellant, any offence under
Section  498A   of   the  IPC,   which     contemplates      cruelty,  that   is
willful conduct of such a nature, as is likely to drive the woman
to commit suicide or to cause grave injury or danger to the life,
limb or health (whether physical or mental) of the woman.
It   is   interesting    to    note    that     in  the    complaint,   the
complainant has given the address of her husband in U.S.A. in
addition to his permanent address at Faridabad.                 The complainant
has, for reasons known to herself, not made any reference in her
complaint to the fact that the Appellant is a resident of Texas,
where he is working.      The complaint gives the impression that the
Appellant is a resident of Faridabad.
From   the  complaint   itself,      it   is   patently   clear  that   the
Appellant does not reside in the same premises as his brother,
being  the   husband   of  the   complainant.          The   averments   in  the
pleadings in the Courts below read with the complaint show that
they do not even live in the same place.               The Appellant works in
Texas,  U.S.A.,    whereas   his    brother      lives   and   works  in   North
Section   498A   of the     IPC     is    extracted   hereinbelow  for
“498-A. Husband or relative of husband of a woman
subjecting her to cruelty.—Whoever, being the husband or
the relative of the husband of a woman, subjects such woman
to cruelty shall be punished with imprisonment for a term
which may extend to three years and shall also be liable to
fine.”
The complainant has not given any particulars of the jewellery
that had allegedly been taken by her mother-in-law and brother-in-
law. There is not a whisper of whether any jewellery is lying with
the Appellant.   It is not even alleged that the Appellant forcibly
took away or misappropriated the complainant’s jewellery or refused
to return the same inspite of request.         Taking custody of jewellery
for safety cannot constitute cruelty within the meaning of Section
498A of the IPC.
There is not even any allegation against the Appellant of any
demand or threat or torture for dowry or property.               Failure to
control an adult brother, living independently, or giving advice to
the complainant to adjust to avoid vindictive retaliation from the
Accused   No. 1   cannot constitute       cruelty    on  the  part   of the
Appellant within the meaning of Section 498A of the IPC.
There are no specific allegations against the Appellant of
misrepresentation or concealment.         There is not a whisper of the
Appellant’s role in the marriage negotiations that took place in
India.   As observed above, the Appellant who is the elder brother-
in-law of the complainant, resides in U.S.A.              There is only a
general omnibus allegation that all the accused ruined the life of
the complainant by misrepresentation, concealment, etc.              On the
face of the averments in the complaint, the complainant’s husband
made  certain   misrepresentations      to    her.    The   Appellant   is  not
liable  for  the   acts  of   cruelty,      or   any  other   wrongful   and/or
criminal acts on the part of his parents or brother.
There is nothing specific against the Appellant except the
vague allegation that the Appellant and his mother, that is the
complainant’s   mother-in-law     kept    her    jewellery.   The  only   other
allegation is that the Appellant had not done anything, when the
complainant had spoken to the Appellant about his brother’s conduct
and behaviour, he had told the complainant to remain quiet as Nitin
could be a very bad enemy.       In any event a deed of compromise has
now been executed between the complainant and her husband being the
Accused  No.   1.  A  copy   of    the    compromise    settlement   has   been
enclosed.   The Appellant is not party to the settlement.
Having regard to the nature of the allegations, it is not
understood how and why the Appellant should have been detained in
India.   In our considered opinion, the Chief Judicial Magistrate,
Kurukshetra, erred in directing this Appellant not to leave the
country without prior permission of the Court.                 The High Court
rejected the prayer of the Appellant to leave the country with the
“I have heard learned counsel for the Applicant-Petitioner
No.4, learned State Counsel and perused the record.
This Court vide order dated 13.10.2021 heard the parties
and in view of the agreed position directed them to appear
before the Magistrate concerned for recording their
statement on 28.10.2021.              Thereafter, learned Chief
Judicial Magistrate, Kurukshetra, sent its report dated
02.11.2021.     It has been recorded in the statement that
complainant-respondent No.2 had stated that she is not
willing to get her statement recorded regarding compromise
as the divorce proceeding between her and her husband,
namely, Nitin, were pending before the Family Court,
Kurukshetra, for 22.02.2022 for recording of the second
motion statement.     She stated that she wanted to get her
statement recorded regarding compromise as well as under
second motion on the same day as there was apprehension of
fleeing away of her husband who is working in USA.
As the complainant expressed her non-willingness to get
the statement recorded regarding compromise, the statement
of the parties could not be recorded.            The main petition
has been filed for quashing of the FIR on the basis of the
compromise arrived at between the parties.                  As the
complainant had the apprehension that the accused might
flee to USA hence she expressed her willingness for not
recording her statement till 22.02.2022 when the case is
fixed before the Family Court for recording the second
motion statement.
In view of the statement made by the complainant-
respondent No.2, this Court finds no merit in the present
application for allowing applicant-petitioner No.4 to leave
the country during pendency of the present petition.
The application being devoid of any merit is hereby
dismissed.”
The apprehension that the husband of the complainant (Accused
No.1) who had been working in the U.S.A. might leave the country
cannot be ground to deny the Appellant’s prayer to go back to the
U.S.A. to resume his duties in a Company in which he has been
working  for  about   9/10   years.      The    High  Court  has  also  not
considered the allegations against the Appellant.             There is not
even any prima facie finding with regard to liability, if any, of
the Appellant to the complainant. There are no specific allegations
against the Appellant.
The  order  of  the   High     Court     denying  permission  to  this
Appellant to leave the country is not sustainable in law and is set
aside. The order of the Chief Judicial Magistrate is, accordingly
modified to the extent that this Appellant has been directed not to
leave the country without prior permission of Court.       The aforesaid
condition shall stand deleted in respect of the Appellant(Accused
No.4). It is made clear that the husband-Nitin Sharma shall be
bound by all the directions in the order dated 13.09.2021 passed by
the Court of the Chief Judicial Magistrate, Kurukshetra.
The instant application was strongly opposed by the State.
This Court finds no merit in the contentions of the State. Ex
facie, the allegations in the FIR do not disclose any offence under
the provisions of the IPC referred to in the FIR. Ms. Monika Gusain
stated that charge-sheet has been filed.       She has not been able to
point out what is the offence so far as this Appellant being the
brother of Nitin Sharma, living in the USA is concerned.             The
repetitive allegations in the complaint are directed against the
husband of the complainant, Nitin Sharma (Accused No.1) and his
parents, particularly, his mother being the Accused No.2.
The appeal is, accordingly, allowed.
Pending applications, if any, stand disposed of accordingly.
