1.      By way of the present petition under Section 15 of the
Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (hereinafter referred to as
“Act”), petitioner is seeking appointment of a substitute arbitrator as
the earlier arbitrator recused himself from adjudicating the matter vide
order dated 27.07.2015 conveyed by email of even date.
2.      Two Share Purchase agreements dated 04.11.2006 were signed
and executed between the petitioners and respondents. Subsequently,
Digitally Signed By:PURAN O.M.P. (T) (COMM.) 99/2018                                      Page 1 of 32
since disputes arose between the parties in respect of the agreements,
petitioners through their counsel issued arbitration notice dated
27.05.2009 to the respondents invoking arbitration clause.
3.      As per the agreements, one arbitrator was to be appointed by
each of the parties. The two appointed arbitrators were to appoint a
Presiding arbitrator. Thus, petitioners nominated an arbitrator in terms
of the agreements between the parties. Vide notice dated 27.05.2009,
respondents were requested to appoint their nominee arbitrator within
30 days of receipt of the said notice. Even after completion of the
statutory period, respondents did not reply to the notice of the
petitioners and did not nominate their arbitrator in terms of the
agreement between the parties.
4.      Hence, in these circumstances petitioners approached this Court
in Arbitration Petition No. 289/2009 under Section 11 of the Act for
appointment of an Arbitrator. Even though as per the specific clause
of the agreements between the parties there was provision for an
arbitral tribunal of three members, the parties agreed for appointment
of a sole arbitrator before this Court. Thus, with the consent of the
parties vide order dated 12.05.2010, this Court appointed a retired
High Court judge as the sole arbitrator to adjudicate disputes between
the parties.
5.      Both the parties appeared before the learned sole arbitrator and
filed their respective pleadings. After completion of the pleadings,
evidence of the parties was concluded on 26.03.2015. The matter was
posted for final arguments on 24.08.2015. At that stage, the learned
sole arbitrator vide order dated 27.07.2015 recused himself from
adjudicating the matter due to personal reasons. Learned arbitrator
Digitally Signed By:PURAN O.M.P. (T) (COMM.) 99/2018                                 Page 2 of 32
sent the said order dated 27.07.2015 thereby recusing himself by email
to the respective parties on the same date, i.e., 27.07.2015.
6.      It is the case of the petitioner that due to some technical default,
the email account of the petitioner was not fully operational for almost
a week. Hence, the said mail was not within the knowledge of the
counsel for the petitioner. The petitioner‟s counsel could access her
mail account by the second week of August, 2015 only when she
noticed the mail by learned arbitrator and immediately intimated the
petitioner accordingly. In the present circumstances, petitioner has
approached this Court for appointment/substitution of another sole
arbitrator to adjudicate the disputes between the parties.
7.      The present petition is accompanied with an application, I.A.
No. 13048/2018 under Section 5 of the Limitation Act read with
Section 151 CPC seeking condonation of delay in filing the present
petition. By way of the said application, it is sought to be explained on
behalf of the petitioner that the learned sole arbitrator sent the order
dated 27.07.2015 of his recusal to the petitioner‟s counsel through
email. However, due to some technical default, the email account of
the petitioner was not fully operational for almost a week. The
petitioner‟s counsel could access her mail account by the second week
of August, 2015. Hence, the order came to the knowledge of the
petitioner only in the second week of August, 2015. The petitioner
filed the present petition on 01.08.2018 within three years from the
date of knowledge of the recusal order. Hence, there is no delay in
filing the present petition.
8.      It is further stated in the said application that the counsel for the
petitioner also deals with other matters of the petitioner. Since the
Digitally Signed By:PURAN O.M.P. (T) (COMM.) 99/2018                                      Page 3 of 32
learned arbitrator recused himself from the matter, counsel for the
petitioner returned the brief back to the office of the petitioner along
with other matters. It appears that the file of the present matter got
mixed up with other disposed of files. Further, there were other two-
three matters of the petitioner in which the learned arbitrator had
recused himself. In some of the matters, compromise talks were going
on and in some of the matters, new arbitrators got appointed. Hence,
in this process the present matter got misplaced. However, recently
while checking the old matters, the present case came to the notice of
the petitioner and the instant petition was immediately filed. Thus, it is
submitted that this Court may condone the delay, if any, in filing the
present petition, though it is the case of the petitioner that the present
petition for substitution of arbitrator has been filed within three years
from the date of knowledge of the order of learned arbitrator by which
he recused himself.
9.      Opposing the petition vehemently, it is submitted on behalf of
respondents that the present petition has been filed after an inordinate
delay of more than 3 years without any acceptable justification. The
petitioners have grossly failed to show any sufficient cause for the
inordinate delay in approaching this Court and have miserably failed
to provide any acceptable reason for delay of more than three years. It
is submitted that petitioners consciously decided to sit on the fence
and permit the limitation to run out. The conduct of the petitioners is
not acceptable as they did not make any efforts for substitution of
arbitrator for three years. Their conduct demonstrates lack of
bonafides and complete indifference to the process of Dispute
Resolution through the mechanism of Arbitration.

10.     It is further submitted on behalf of respondents that email dated
27.07.2015 sent by learned arbitrator was deliberately suppressed in
the present proceedings by filing only a true typed copy purporting the
same to be the correct version of the said email. Respondents have
filed copy of the email sent by learned arbitrator to all parties and its
counsels on 27.07.2015 along with their reply. Referring to the said
email, it is contended that communication from the learned arbitrator
to all the concerned parties and their counsels was always through
email address. As is apparent from the bare perusal of the said email,
the same is marked to three individuals working in the law firm
representing the petitioners. Thus, the contention on behalf of the
petitioners that petitioners‟ counsel could access her email account by
second week of August, 2015, refers to only one of the three persons
to whom the email was sent.
11.     It is further contended that no sufficient cause has been
disclosed by the petitioners for condonation of delay. In the
application for condonation of delay, petitioners have alleged that due
to some technical default, the email account of the petitioners‟ counsel
was not fully operational for almost a week. However, there is no
specific date or period of the month stated in the application as regards
alleged technical default and neither have the petitioners given any
detail or proof of the alleged technical default. It is, thus, denied by
the respondents that there was any technical default in the email
account of the petitioners‟ counsel or that the petitioners‟ counsel
accessed her email account in the second week of August, 2015 only.
It is submitted that the application for condonation of delay as filed by
the petitioners contains nothing but falsehood and that the petitioners
Digitally Signed By:PURAN O.M.P. (T) (COMM.) 99/2018                                   Page 5 of 32
have tried to overreach this Court by resorting to falsehood.
12.     In rejoinder, by referring to Article 137 of the Limitation Act,
1963, it is submitted on behalf of petitioners that the period of
limitation for filing a petition under Section 15 of the Act commences
from the date when the right to apply accrues. The right to apply
accrued only after expiry of 30 days from the date of recusal of the
learned Arbitrator. Thus, right to apply arose on 26.08.2015. The
learned arbitrator recused himself on 27.07.2015 and the limitation of
three years started running only after the expiry of 30 days from the
date of said recusal, which expired on 26.08.2018. It is submitted that
the present petition was filed on 01.08.2018 and after removal of
defects was re-filed on 25.08.2018. Hence, the present petition has
been filed well within the limitation period as provided under Article
137 of the Limitation Act, 1963.
13.      The petitioners have relied upon the following judgments in
support of their submissions:
(i) National Highways Authority of India and Anr. Vs.
(ii) Balwant Singh and Ors. Vs. Gurbachan Singh and Ors.,
(iii) Govt of Maharashtra Vs. Bose Brothers Engineers and
14.     In rebuttal, respondents made further submissions and
contended that the right to apply accrued from the date when the sole
Arbitrator recused himself. As per Section 15(2) of the Act, an
arbitrator shall be substituted in the same manner and according to the
same Rules that were applicable to the appointment of an arbitrator
Digitally Signed By:PURAN O.M.P. (T) (COMM.) 99/2018                                  Page 6 of 32
being replaced. Since in the present case, initial appointment of
Arbitrator was by this Court, substituted Arbitrator can be appointed
only by this Court in terms of Section 15 of the Act. Thus, petitioners
cannot count period of 30 days while calculating the period of
limitation on the wrong premise that respondents were to appoint
substitute Arbitrator within 30 days of recusal by Arbitrator.
15.     In support of their submissions, respondents have relied upon
the following judgments:
(i)    Bharat Sanchar Nigam Ltd. and Another Vs. Nortel
(ii)   Government of Maharashtra (Water Resources
Department) Vs. Borse Brothers Engineers and

16.      I have heard learned counsels for the parties and given my
thoughtful consideration to the issues raised before this Court.
17.       There is no dispute that since no time limit is fixed by the Act
for filing a petition under Section 15 for substitution of an Arbitrator,
the Limitation is to be computed as per Article 137 of the Limitation
Act, 1963, which reads as under:
Description of                        Period of       Time from which period
application                           limitation            begins to run
137.Any other application for which   Three years  When the right to apply accrues.
no period of limitation is provided
18.      From a plain reading of Article 137 of Limitation Act, 1963 it is
clear that the period of limitation for filing a petition under Section 15
of the Act commences from the day „when the right to apply accrues‟.
19.      This Court has to consider as to when the right to apply accrued
in the instant case. It has been contended on behalf of the petitioners
that the learned sole Arbitrator recused himself vide order dated
27.07.2015, which was sent to the petitioners‟ counsel through E-mail.
However, the petitioners‟ counsel was able to access her e-mail
Digitally Signed By:PURAN O.M.P. (T) (COMM.) 99/2018                                         Page 8 of 32
account only by the second week of August, 2015, since due to some
technical default, the e-mail account of the petitioners‟ counsel was
not operational for almost a week. Thus, it has been contended that
present petition filed on 01.08.2018 is within time having been filed
within three years from the date of knowledge of the recusal order.
20.     Having considered the submissions made on behalf of
petitioners, the same do not inspire confidence. Their explanation in
order to bring their petition within the period of limitation is nebulous
and doubtful and cannot be accepted on the face of it.
21.     Even otherwise, from perusal of Article 137 of the Limitation
Act, it is clear that the said Article is not based on knowledge. The
statute clearly stipulates so, wherever knowledge is intended to be the
basis upon which time is to commence for the purpose of reckoning
limitation. Thus, Articles 4, 54, 56, 57, 59, 61, 68, 71, 91, 92-95, 110
and 123 of the Limitation Act are based on knowledge, whereas
Article 137 is not based on knowledge.
22.     On the issue of knowledge for commencement of limitation,
Supreme Court in the case of Popat Bahiru Govardhane and Others
Vs. Special Land Acquisition Officer and Another, (2013) 10 SCC
765 held as follows:-
―8. The sole question for the consideration of the Court is
whether limitation for filing the application for
redetermination of the compensation under Section 28-A of
the Act would commence from the date of the award or
from the date of knowledge of the court's award on the
basis of which such application is being filed?
9. Though, there is nothing on record to substantiate the
appellants' claim that they could acquire the knowledge of
the court's award only on 17-7-2006 and immediately took
steps to file application for redetermination under Section
Digitally Signed By:PURAN O.M.P. (T) (COMM.) 99/2018                                   Page 9 of 32
28-A of the Act.
10. The issue involved herein is no more res integra. The
appellants' case before the High Court as well as before us
has been that the limitation would commence from the date
of acquisition of knowledge and not from the date of
award. Though, Shri Gaurav Agarwal, learned counsel for
the appellants, has fairly conceded that there is no
occasion for this Court to consider the application of the
provisions of the Limitation Act, 1963 (hereinafter called
―the 1963 Act‖) inasmuch as the provisions of Section 5 of
the said Act.
14. In State of A.P. v. Marri Venkaiah [(2003) 7 SCC 280 :
AIR 2003 SC 2949] , this Court reconsidered the aforesaid
judgments including the judgment in Harish Chandra Raj
Singh [AIR 1961 SC 1500] and held that the statute
provides limitation of 3 months from the date of award by
the court excluding the time required for obtaining the
copy from the date of award. It has no relevance so far as
the date of acquisition of knowledge by the applicant is
concerned. In view of the express language of the statute,
the question of knowledge did not arise and, therefore, the
plea of the applicants that limitation of 3 months would
begin from the date of knowledge, was clearly
unsustainable and could not be accepted. The Court also
rejected the contention of the applicants that a beneficial
legislation should be given a liberal interpretation
observing that whosoever wants to take advantage of the
beneficial legislation has to be vigilant and has to take
appropriate action within the time-limit prescribed under
the statute. Such an applicant must at least be vigilant in
making efforts to find out whether the other landowners
have filed any reference application and if so, what is the
result thereof. If that is not done then the law cannot help
him. The ratio of the judgment in Harish Chandra Raj
Singh [AIR 1961 SC 1500] was held to be non-applicable
in case of Section 28-A of the Act. The Court observed :
(Marri Venkaiah case [(2003) 7 SCC 280 : AIR 2003 SC
2949] , SCC pp. 284-85, paras 11-12)
―11. … In that case, the Court interpreted the
Digitally Signed By:PURAN O.M.P. (T) (COMM.) 99/2018                                   Page 10 of 32
proviso to Section 18 of the Act and held that clause
(a) of the proviso was not applicable in the said case
because the person making the application was not
present or was not represented before the Collector
at the time when he made his award. The Court also
held that notice from the Collector under Section
12(2) was also not issued, therefore, that part of
clause (b) of the proviso would not be applicable.
The Court, therefore, referred to the second part of
the proviso which provides that such application
can be made within six months from the date of the
Collector's award. In the context of the scheme of
Section 18 of the Act, the Court held that the award
by the Land Acquisition Officer is an offer of market
price by the State for purchase of the
property. Hence, for the said offer, knowledge,
actual or constructive, of the party affected by the
award was an essential requirement of fair play and
natural justice. Therefore, the second part of the
proviso must mean the date when either the award
was communicated to the party or was known by
him either actually or constructively.
12. The aforesaid reasoning would not be applicable
for interpretation of Section 28-A because there is
no question of issuing notice to such an applicant as
he is not a party to the reference proceeding before
the court. The award passed by the court cannot be
termed as an offer for market price for purchase of
the land. There is no duty cast upon the court to
issue notice to the landowners who have not
initiated proceedings for enhancement of
compensation by filing reference applications;
maybe, that their lands are acquired by a common
notification issued under Section 4 of the Act. As
against this, under Section 18 it is the duty of the
Collector to issue notice either under Section 12(2)
of the Act at the time of passing of the award or in
any case the date to be pronounced before passing
of the award and if this is not done then the period
prescribed for filing application under Section 18 is
Digitally Signed By:PURAN O.M.P. (T) (COMM.) 99/2018                                    Page 11 of 32
six months from the date of the Collector's award.‖
16. It is a settled legal proposition that law of limitation
may harshly affect a particular party but it has to be
applied with all its rigour when the statute so prescribes.
The court has no power to extend the period of limitation
on equitable grounds. The statutory provision may cause
hardship or inconvenience to a particular party but the
court has no choice but to enforce it giving full effect to the
same. The legal maxim dura lex sed lex which means ―the
law is hard but it is the law‖, stands attracted in such a
situation. It has consistently been held that,
―inconvenience is not‖ a decisive factor to be considered
while interpreting a statute. ―A result flowing from a
statutory provision is never an evil. A court has no power
to ignore that provision to relieve what it considers a
distress resulting from its operation.‖
23.     Similarly in the case of Gaon Sabha Samhalka Vs. RN Sahani
and Ors., 2004 SCC OnLine Del 575; ILR (2004) 2 Delhi 128, this
Court has held in very categorical terms that where Parliament
intended knowledge to be the basis upon which time is to commence
for the purposes of reckoning limitation, the statute has enacted it to
be so. Thus, this Court has held as follows:-
―20. The well-known canon of statutory interpretation
embodied in the maxim ―Expresio unis est exclusio
alterius‖- i.e. what is expressly mentioned in one place but
not in another must be taken to be deliberately omitted has
been resorted to frequently by the Supreme Court [Khemka
& Co. (Agencies) Pvt. Ltd. v. State of Maharashtra, (1975)
2 SCC 22 : AIR 1975 SC 1549. Union of India v. Shiv
That rule would squarely apply to the present case. The
express allusion to knowledge in Entry 15 leads to the
conclusion that knowledge has no role to play in respect of
the other periods of limitation under the Act.
Digitally Signed By:PURAN O.M.P. (T) (COMM.) 99/2018                                       Page 12 of 32
21. It is, therefore, clear that where Parliament intended
knowledge to be the basis upon which time is to commence
for the purposes of reckoning limitation, the Statute has
enacted it to be so. This consider the ―knowledge‖ based
construction canvassed by Mr. Shali, in respect of Entry
22. So far as the argument of an interpretation based on
the objects, or purpose of the enactment is concerned, it is
settled law that where the words of a statute are plain,
there can be no recourse to external aids [N. Bhagvattry
Ammal v. Commissioner of Income Tax, (2003) 3 SCC 161
: AIR 2003 SC 1040; Bhaiji v. Sub Divisional Officer,
(2003) 1 SCC 692.] . Hence the plain meaning of the
expression ―use‖ in Entry 17 has to be applied.
Consequently, the limitation (for taking action)
commenced in the present case at least from 1988, when
the use of the lands had changed. The proceedings were
started on 29/01/1993, admittedly beyond the period of
three years.
23. The issue can be viewed from another perspective. The
power to initiate proceedings under Section 81(2) for
ejectment is regulated by express terms of the enactment.
One such express term is the limitation placed upon the
power, namely, the period within which it can be
exercised. Such limitation is not merely akin to statute or a
provision that prescribes a period of limitation — it also
trenches upon the very exercise of power. Having not used
the power within the parameters prescribed by the statute,
it is not open to the authority, to wit, the
Collector/Additional Collector to take recourse to it
beyond the conditions imposed by law.
24. It may be observed that the Supreme Court has held
that while interpreting a provision in a statute prescribing
a time limit for initiation of proceedings, considerations of
equity and hardship are out of place.
25. In view of the above discussion, inescapable
conclusion is that the period of limitation prescribed by
entry 17 in the first Schedule to the Delhi Land Reforms
Act, 1954 is the actual date of unlawful use of land and not
the date of knowledge.‖
Digitally Signed By:PURAN O.M.P. (T) (COMM.) 99/2018                                   Page 13 of 32
24.     In view of the aforesaid discussion, it is clear that the right to
apply accrues in the present case on 27.07.2015 when the learned
arbitrator recused himself by order dated 27.07.2015 which was sent
by e-mail to the respective parties. The contention raised on behalf of
the petitioners that the period of limitation will commence from the
date of the alleged knowledge in the second week of August, 2015, is
accordingly rejected.
25.     The second contention raised on behalf of the petitioners on the
aspect of limitation is that the right to apply in terms of Article 137 of
the Limitation Act accrued only after expiry of 30 days from the date
of recusal of the learned arbitrator. From the perusal of record, it is
seen that when the disputes arose between the parties, the petitioners
issued arbitration notice dated 27.05.2009 to respondents invoking
arbitration clause and nominated an arbitrator on their behalf, and
requested the respondents to appoint their nominee arbitrator within
30 days of receipt of the said notice. Since respondents did not
nominate their arbitrator, petitioners approached this Court by way of
filing a petition under Section 11 of the Act. Thus, by order dated
12.05.2010, this Court appointed a sole arbitrator with the consent of
the parties.
26.     It is settled law that the procedure for substitution of an
arbitrator under Section 15 of the Act must be the same as the initial
appointment of the said arbitrator, who is sought to be substituted.
Section 15 of the Act is very categorical in its stipulation that where
the mandate of an arbitrator terminates, a substitute arbitrator shall be
appointed according to the Rules that were applicable to the
Digitally Signed By:PURAN O.M.P. (T) (COMM.) 99/2018                                   Page 14 of 32
appointment of the arbitrator being replaced. Section 14 of the Act
states that mandate of an arbitrator shall terminate and he shall be
substituted by another arbitrator if he withdraws from his office. Thus,
in the present case the mandate of the arbitrator was terminated when
he recused himself from the arbitral proceedings.
27.     Considering the facts in the present case, it is clear that
appointment of the sole arbitrator in the present case was done by this
Court. Section 11(2) of the Act provides that the parties are free to
agree on a procedure for appointing an arbitrator or arbitrators. If there
is no procedure agreed between the parties for appointment of an
arbitrator, then in terms of Section 11(5) of the Act, appointment of an
arbitrator is to be made within 30 days from receipt of a request by
one party from the other party. If an arbitrator is not so appointed
within 30 days of receipt of request for appointment of an arbitrator,
then as per Section 11(4) of the Act, an application is made before
Court for appointment of an arbitrator. In the present case, arbitrator
was not appointed by respondent in terms of Section 11(5) of the Act.
Thus, this Court in exercise of its power under Section 11(6) of the
Act appointed sole arbitrator in the present case. Once a party forfeits
its right for appointment of an arbitrator and arbitrator is appointed by
Court, then said right cannot be revived subsequently for substitution
of an arbitrator in terms of Section 15 of the Act. The procedure as
given under Section 11(5) of the Act cannot be resorted to for
substitution of an arbitrator, when the initial appointment of an
arbitrator is done by Court in exercise of its power under Section
11(6) of the Act.
28.     In the present case, order appointing the arbitrator by this Court
Digitally Signed By:PURAN O.M.P. (T) (COMM.) 99/2018                                   Page 15 of 32
was a consent order and on this account, the parties in the present case
had given up their right for appointment of an arbitrator. Therefore,
petitioner did not have the option to resort to the procedure as
envisaged under Section 11(5) of the Act to wait for 30 days for the
respondent to appoint an arbitrator after recusal by the arbitrator in
order to contend that the limitation period in terms of Article 137 of
the Limitation Act commenced only after expiry of 30 days. Such a
course of action was not available to the petitioner.
29.     Considering the above, substituted arbitrator in the present case
is to be appointed by this Court only in terms of Section 15 of the Act
in consonance with the Rules applicable to the appointment of the
arbitrator being replaced. It was not permissible for the respondents to
appoint a substitute arbitrator as the initial appointment itself was
made by this Court. Therefore, the contention on behalf of the
petitioners that the limitation period of 3 years in terms of Article 137
of the Limitation Act started running only after expiry of 30 days from
the date of recusal of the arbitrator, is totally misplaced and is
rejected.
30.     Reliance by the petitioner on the decision of National
Highways Authority of India and Anr. Vs. Bhumihiway DDB Ltd.
(JV) & Ors. (supra), is not found tenable. In the said case, Supreme
Court held that the initial appointment by the High Court under
Section 11(6) was invalid as the Procedure under the Contract had not
been followed. It was only after holding the initial appointment to be
bad that the Supreme Court held that parties would need to follow the
procedure under their contract for substitution under Section 15(2).
However, that is not the position in the present case, as petition under
Digitally Signed By:PURAN O.M.P. (T) (COMM.) 99/2018                                   Page 16 of 32
Section 11(6) of the Act was filed as per law which culminated in
appointment of the Arbitrator, who is now sought to be substituted.
31.     Distinguishing the judgment in the case of Bhumihiway (supra)
from a case like the present one where there was failure on the part of
the party to appoint/nominate their arbitrator, this Court in the case of
Highway Authority of India & Ors., 2018 SCC OnLine Del 7588
―10. However, if one may look into paras 4, 9, 26 & 40 of
the same judgment one finds the facts are little
different Bhumihiway case (supra). Para 4 gives the
relevant arbitration clause which is as under:
―4. On 11.06.2001, the appellants entered into an
agreement with respondent No. 1 for the aforesaid
contract. The contract agreement contained a
mechanism for resolution of disputes between the
parties as contained in Sub-Clause 67.3 Sub-Clause
67.3 reads as follows:
(i) A dispute with an Indian Contractor shall
be finally settled by arbitration in accordance
with the Arbitration & Conciliation Act, 1996,
or any statutory amendment thereof. The
arbitral tribunal shall consist of 3 arbitrators,
one each to be appointed by the Employer and
the Contractor. The third Arbitrator shall be
chosen by the two Arbitrators so appointed by
the Parties and shall act as Presiding
arbitrator. In case of failure of the two
arbitrators, appointed by the parties to reach
upon a consensus within a period of 30 days
from the appointment of the arbitrator
appointed subsequently, the Presiding
arbitrator shall be appointed by the

No. 3. Thereafter, in view of the disagreement
between the two nominated arbitrators, respondent
No. 1 sought clarification from respondent No. 2
herein vide its letter dated 29.04.2005. Respondent
No. 1 requested respondent No. 2 if any judicial
arbitrator is available with them for the purpose of
nomination as Presiding Arbitrator. It was pointed
out that respondent No. 1 never sought any
intervention of respondent No. 2 for appointment of
the Presiding Arbitrator rather it only sought
clarification in this regard. Vide letter dated
03.05.2005, respondent No. 2 - Indian Road
Congress (IRC) informed respondent No. 1 that
there does not exist any judicial arbitrator in its
panel. Thereafter, respondent No. 1 filed Arbitration
Petition No. 23 of 2005 before the High Court under
Section 11(6) of the Arbitration & Conciliation Act,
1996 (hereinafter referred to as ―the Act‖)
requesting for the appointment of the Presiding
Arbitrator. The said petition, according to the
appellants, was in gross violation of the statutory
provisions of Section 11(6) as also against the
contractual terms agreed to between the parties
without making any reference to respondent No. 2
for the appointment of the Presiding Arbitrator.
26. It is pertinent to state that under Section 11(6) of
the Act, the Court has jurisdiction to make the
appointment only when the person including an
institution, fails to perform any function entrusted to
it under that procedure. In the present case, the
relief claimed by the respondents by invoking
Section 11(6) is wholly erroneous as prior to the
order dated 1.7.2005, the respondents only sought a
clarification from IRC and without making a
reference to them, immediately filed the petition
under Section 11(6) on the purported ground that
the Indian Road Congress had failed to make the
appointment within the stipulated time. Therefore,
the reliance placed by the respondent on the
judgment of this Court in the case of Punj Lloyd
Digitally Signed By:PURAN O.M.P. (T) (COMM.) 99/2018                                     Page 18 of 32
Ltd. v. Petronet MHB Ltd., (2006) 2 SCC 638 is
wholly erroneous and is not applicable to the facts
of the present case.
40. As rightly pointed out by the appellants, the
High Court failed to appreciate that in accordance
with Section 15(2) of the Act on the termination of
the mandate of the Presiding Arbitrator, the two
nominated arbitrators were first required to reach a
consensus and on their failure to arrive at a
consensus only respondent No. 2 was authorized to
make the appointment. Unless respondent No. 2
failed to exercise its jurisdiction, the High Court
could not assume jurisdiction under Section 11(6) of
the Act. Respondent No. 1 has wrongly invoked the
jurisdiction of this Court without first following the
procedure agreed to between the parties. Thus no
cause of action had arisen in the facts of the case to
seek the appointment from the High Court under
Section 11(6) of the Act and thus the said petition
was premature. The High Court also is not correct
in relying on the contention of the respondent No. 1
that in case one of the arbitrators is retired Chief
Justice, the Presiding Arbitrator should be at least a
retired Chief Justice or a retired Judge of a High
Court with considerable experience. It was
submitted by learned Solicitor General appearing
for the appellants that the said finding of the High
Court is self contradictory inasmuch as if the
Presiding Arbitrator is a retired Judge of the High
Court and one of the arbitrators is a retired Chief
Justice of the High Court, the member of hierarchy
is upset. Even otherwise, there does not exist any
such provision in law which requires that if one of
the arbitrators is a retired Judge the Presiding
Arbitrator also has to be a retired Judge. The
parties have entered into a contract after fully
understanding the import of the terms so agreed to
from which there cannot be any deviation. The
Courts have held that the parties are required to
comply with the procedure of appointment as agreed
Digitally Signed By:PURAN O.M.P. (T) (COMM.) 99/2018                                    Page 19 of 32
to and the defaulting party cannot be allowed to
take advantage of its own wrong.‖
12. Thus the law as discussed is very clear that if within 30
days time a party fail to respond to the request of the
applicant to appoint an arbitrator or it fails to appoint till
prior to filing of an application under Section 11 of the Act
he can still appoint, but once application under Section
11(6) is filed by the applicant the right of appointment of
the non-applicant seizes.
13. Bhumihiway (Supra) is distinguishable from the
judgments cited above in the sense that instead of refusal
to appoint the presiding arbitrator, the respondent no. 1
rather sought a clarification from Indian Road Congress
vide its letter dated 29.04.2005 requesting if any panel of
judicial arbitrators is with them. It never sought
intervention of respondent no. 2 for appointment of
presiding arbitrator nor refused but simply sought
clarification, hence as there was no failure on the part of
the respondent no. 2 to nominate the presiding arbitrator,
the Court held the respondent no. 1 had no right to
approach the Court under Section 11(6) of the Act.
14. However in the present case as there was a failure on
the part of respondent no. 2 and 3 to appoint to nominate
their arbitrator, so the Court appointed the same under
Section 11(6). Per settled law as this Court had appointed
Mr. Justice B.N. Kirpal (Retd.) the nominee arbitrator for
respondents no. 2 and 3, hence only this Court can
nominate a substitute arbitrator inplace of the said
arbitrator.‖
32.     In the present case, neither party has asserted that the initial
appointment by this Court was incorrect. Accordingly, when one of
the parties to the arbitration agreement approached this Court for
appointment of an arbitrator, the rights of the other party for
appointment of an arbitrator stand forfeited. In the case of Sap India
Private Limited Vs. Cox and Kings Limited, 2019 SCC OnLine Bom
722, it has been held as follows:-
Digitally Signed By:PURAN O.M.P. (T) (COMM.) 99/2018                                   Page 20 of 32
―48. It can be thus clearly seen from the common thread
which flows from decisions of the Supreme Court in
Yashwith Constructions (P) Ltd. (supra)*1 and Shailesh
Dhairyawan (supra)*2 and the decisions of learned Single
Judge of Delhi High Court in Mithlesh Kumar Aggarwal
(supra)*3 and GMR Ambala Chandigarh Expressways Pvt.
Ltd. (supra) *4, and the decision of learned Single Judge of
Calcutta High Court in ―R.B. Rajesh Vs. The Chief
Engineer‖ (supra) *5, and the decisions of learned Single
Judge of this Court in Rajesh K. Shah Vs. Kamlesh K.
Sahani (supra)*6, and Ignatius Tony Pereira (supra)*7,
that when the initial appointment of an arbitrator is made
by the Court by an order passed under Section 11 of the
Act, an appointment of a substitute arbitrator would be
required to be made in the same manner by the Court, as
in terms of Section 15 subsection (2) of the Act the initial
procedure and the rule so followed, would be required to
be followed in appointing a substitute arbitrator. This is
also for the reason that the party whose right to make an
appointment of an arbitrator as per the arbitration
agreement stands forfeited, in the Court making the
appointment as per Section 11 of the Act, would not have
any authority to make an appointment of a substitute
arbitrator.
49. The following principles of law can be clearly derived
from the aforesaid decisions of the Supreme Court and the
(i) Parties to an arbitration agreement at the threshold
would have a right to appoint an arbitral tribunal as per
the arbitration agreement entered between the parties. In
case of non-concurrence, inaction or disagreement to so
appoint, if requested by one party, this right if not
exercised for a period of 30 days would continue to exist
Digitally Signed By:PURAN O.M.P. (T) (COMM.) 99/2018                                   Page 21 of 32
till an application by the other party is filed under Section
11(6) of the Act.
(ii) Once one of the parties to an arbitration agreement
approaches the Court under Section 11(6) of the Act
seeking appointment of an arbitrator on failure of the
other party to appoint an arbitrator, the rights of the party
not appointing an arbitrator stands forfeited and it will be
for the Court to then pass an order under Section 11(6) of
the Act to appoint an arbitrator.
(iii) Once the Court appoints an arbitrator by an order
passed on an application under Section 11 of the Act, and
a vacancy arises on the arbitral tribunal on account of any
of the circumstances as set out under Section 14(1) and/or
Section 15(1) of the Act, then necessarily Section 15(2)
becomes operational for appointment of a substitute
arbitrator and it would be the Court which would be
required to be approached to fill up the vacancy. The same
procedure/rule would be required to be followed by an
application under Section 15(2) of the Act to fill up the
vacancy of the Court appointed arbitrator.
(iv) As a sequel to (iii) above, once the Court appoints an
arbitrator under Section 11(6) of the Act, it is not open for
the party against whom such an order is passed to contend
that the right which was so forfeited would revive for any
purpose including to appoint a substitute arbitrator in case
of any vacancy on the arbitral tribunal as postulated by
Sections 14 and 15 of the Act.
(v) In other words a party who suffers an order under
Section 11(6) of the Act of the Court appointing an
arbitrator, cannot contend that the arbitration agreement
has become available to such a party after the very
foundation of such right to appoint an arbitrator is taken
away by the Court appointing an arbitrator.
(vi) The above position in law is implicit from the
provisions of subsection 2 of Section 15 of the Act when
the provision says that when the mandate of an arbitral
tribunal terminates, a substitute arbitrator shall be
appointed ―according to the rules that were applicable to
the appointment of an arbitrator being replaced‖.
50. As observed by the Supreme Court in ACC Ltd. Vs.
Digitally Signed By:PURAN O.M.P. (T) (COMM.) 99/2018                                    Page 22 of 32
Global Cements Ltd.(supra)*1 Section 15(2) of the Act has
to be given a liberal interpretation so as to apply to all
possible circumstances in which the mandate of the
arbitrator could be terminated. Also considering the clear
position in law which would flow from the decisions as
referred above, it cannot be conceived that Section 15(2)
would not recognize rights of a party being forfeited (to
take recourse to the arbitration agreement) to appoint a
substitute arbitrator when such right stood extinguished
when the Court appointed an arbitrator in an order passed
under Section 11(6) of the Act. Thus, necessarily the rule
that would be applicable to the appointment of a substitute
arbitrator would be the rule/procedure which was
applicable for the initial appointment namely the
appointment by the Court and not appointment by a party
who had already lost and/or forfeited its right to make an
appointment of an arbitrator. In other words, once such
right to make an appointment of an arbitrator/arbitral
tribunal are given up by one of the parties, then
necessarily the only rule and procedure of an arbitrator
being appointed by the Court is required to be recognized
in terms of Section 15(2) and no other procedure. It cannot
be accepted that the forfeiture of the right of a party not
appointing an arbitrator is only a partial or temporary
forfeiture limited to Section 11(6) of the Act and that such
a right would resurrect or is reborn when it comes to
appointment of substitute arbitrator. Such an
interpretation would amount to a complete misreading of
the legislative scheme of Sections 11, 14 and 15 of the Act.
51. In addition to the above discussion in my opinion, a
rebirth of a right which stood forfeited also cannot be
conceived for other two primary reasons, firstly for the
reason that this would amount to a clear waiver of right as
recognised by Section 4 of the Act, and secondly and most
importantly the law would not permit sanctity of judicial
procedure adopted in the court passing an order under
Section 11(6) of the Act to be obliterated, diluted, taken
Digitally Signed By:PURAN O.M.P. (T) (COMM.) 99/2018                                   Page 23 of 32
away or being extinguished, merely because there is
vacancy on the arbitral tribunal. Once the initial
appointment itself is under the orders of the Court, there is
no question of waived rights or forfeited rights being
revived or resurrected for the purposes of either Section 14
and 15 of the Act. In the present case indubitably the
appointment of Mr. Justice D.B. Bhosale (Retd) was made
in pursuance of an order dated 30 November 2018 passed
by this Court under Section 11(6) of the Act as a nominee
arbitrator of the respondent. This order was confirmed by
the Supreme Court by its order dated 2 January 2019
passed in a petition of the respondent for Special Leave to
Appeal (c) No.33555 of 2018. Thus the rule and the
procedure as followed in appointment of initial arbitrator
Mr. Justice D.B. Bhosale (Retd) was the rule and the
procedure under Section 11(6) of the Act and not any other
procedure. This procedure would be required to be
recognised as a rule followed in the appointment of initial
arbitrator in terms of Section 15(2) of the Act for the
purpose of appointment of a substitute arbitrator.‖
33.     In view of the law discussed as aforesaid, it is clear that the
limitation period of 3 years in terms of Article 137 of the Limitation
Act commenced from the date when the arbitrator recused himself.
Once the initial appointment was under the order of the Court, the
right of the party to appoint an arbitrator stood extinguished and
forfeited. Thus, period of 30 days for appointment of an arbitrator
after recusal of the sole arbitrator, would not be available for the
purposes of calculating the period of limitation in order to assess when
the limitation period commenced in terms of Article 137 of the
34.     In this regard, following dates are material:
(i)     27.07.2015 – Recusal by Arbitrator
Digitally Signed By:PURAN O.M.P. (T) (COMM.) 99/2018                                   Page 24 of 32
(ii)    26.07.2018 – 3 years period came to an end
(iii)   01.08.2018 – Present petition under Section 15 was filed
without any condonation of delay
(iv)    22.09.2018 – Application under Section 5 of the Limitation Act
was filed for condonation of delay.
35.     In view thereof, the present petition is clearly barred by
limitation.
36.     The next question that arises for consideration of this Court is
whether the petitioner has made out a case for condonation of delay in
the present case. There is a delay of 5 days in filing the present
petition.
37.      On the aspect of limitation, this Court in the case of Tarun
ILR (2011) 4 Del 530 has held as follows:-
―13. The period within which a party must approach the
competent court to seek the appointment of an arbitrator is
three years in terms of entry No.137 of the schedule to
the Limitation Act. The right to apply to the court to seek
the appointment of substitute arbitrator accrued upon the
passing of the order dated 8th October, 2006. Therefore
the petitioner should have approached the court for
appointment of substitute arbitrator by 17th October,
14. Reliance placed by Mr. Singla on Section 15(2) of the
Act is again misplaced. All that the said provision provides
is that where the mandate of an arbitrator terminates, a
substitute arbitrator shall be appointed according to the
rules that were applicable to the appointment of the
arbitrator being replaced. However, this does not mean
that the process for appointment of substituted arbitrator
can be delayed by a party indefinitely. The said process
has to be initiated within the period of limitation
prescribed by law.‖

38.     Holding that three year period of limitation as prescribed under
Article 137 of the Limitation Act is unduly long period for filing an
application under Section 11 for appointment of an arbitrator, since it
would defeat the object of Arbitration Act, Supreme Court in the case
of Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited and Another Vs. Nortel Networks
India Private Limited, (2021) 5 SCC 738 held as under:-
―21. Given the vacuum in the law to provide a period of
limitation under Section 11 of the Arbitration and
Conciliation 1996, the Courts have taken recourse to the
position that the limitation period would be governed
by Article 137, which provides a period of 3 years from the
date when the right to apply accrues. However, this is an
unduly long period for filing an application under Section
11, since it would defeat the very object of the Act, which
provides for expeditious resolution of commercial disputes
within a time-bound period. The 1996 Act has been
amended twice over in 2015 and 2019, to provide for
further time-limits to ensure that the arbitration
proceedings        are    conducted      and       concluded
expeditiously. Section 29-A mandates that the Arbitral
Tribunal will conclude the proceedings within a period of
18 months. In view of the legislative intent, the period of 3
years for filing an application under Section 11 would run
contrary to the scheme of the Act. It would be necessary
for Parliament to effect an amendment to Section 11,
prescribing a specific period of limitation within which a
party may move the court for making an application for
appointment of the arbitration under Section 11 of the
39.     Thus, Supreme Court has time and again stressed that
arbitration proceedings ought to be conducted in a time bound manner
and concluded expeditiously. It has been held that one of the main
Digitally Signed By:PURAN O.M.P. (T) (COMM.) 99/2018                                    Page 26 of 32
objectives of the Arbitration Act is the speedy disposal of disputes
through the arbitral process. Unduly long period of limitation for filing
an application under Section 11 for appointment of an arbitrator has
been held by Supreme Court to defeat the very object of the
Arbitration Act for expeditious resolution of disputes. The aforesaid
observations of Supreme Court apply fully to petitions under Section
15 of the Act for substitution of an arbitrator.
40.     It has been repeatedly held by various courts that the main
object of the Arbitration Act is speedy resolution of disputes and that
the said object would be the most important principle to be applied
when applications under Section 5 of the Limitation Act are filed
seeking condonation of delay in courts in respect of proceedings qua
Arbitration. It has been held by Supreme Court that delay qua
proceedings under Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 are to be
condoned by way of exception and not by way of rule. Thus, in the
case of Government of Maharashtra (Water Resources Department)
Vs. Borse Brothers Engineers and Contractors Private Limited,
(2021) 6 SCC 460, Hon‟ble Supreme Court has held as follows:-
―...........27. Even in the rare situation in which an appeal
under Section 37 of the Arbitration Act would be of a
specified value less than three lakh rupees, resulting in
Article 116 or 117 of the Limitation Act applying, the main
object of the Arbitration Act requiring speedy resolution of
disputes would be the most important principle to be
applied when applications under Section 5 of the
Limitation Act are filed to condone delay beyond 90 days
and/or 30 days depending upon whether Article 116(a) or
116(b) or 117 applies. As a matter of fact, given the
timelines contained in Sections 8, 9(2), 11(4), 11(13),
13(2)-(5), 29-A, 29-B, 33(3)-(5) and 34(3) of the
Arbitration Act, and the observations made in some of this
Digitally Signed By:PURAN O.M.P. (T) (COMM.) 99/2018                                    Page 27 of 32
Court's judgments, the object of speedy resolution of
disputes would govern appeals covered by Articles 116
and 117 of the Limitation Act.
63. Given the aforesaid and the object of speedy disposal
sought to be achieved both under the Arbitration Act and
the Commercial Courts Act, for appeals filed under
Section 37 of the Arbitration Act that are governed by
Articles 116 and 117 of the Limitation Act or Section 13(1-
A) of the Commercial Courts Act, a delay beyond 90 days,
30 days or 60 days, respectively, is to be condoned by way
of exception and not by way of rule. In a fit case in which a
party has otherwise acted bona fide and not in a negligent
manner, a short delay beyond such period can, in the
discretion of the court, be condoned, always bearing in
mind that the other side of the picture is that the opposite
party may have acquired both in equity and justice, what
may now be lost by the first party's inaction, negligence or
laches.
41.     Undisputed position of law is that when there is no sufficient
cause shown for condoning delay or when the application for
condonation of delay is vague, then such application for condonation
of delay must be rejected, regardless of duration. Detailing as to what
is “sufficient cause” which may prevent a party from approaching the
Court within limitation, Supreme Court in the case of Basawaraj and
2013 SCC OnLine SC 758 held as follows:-
―9. Sufficient cause is the cause for which the defendant
could not be blamed for his absence. The meaning of the
word ―sufficient‖ is ―adequate‖ or ―enough‖, inasmuch
as may be necessary to answer the purpose intended.
Therefore, the word ―sufficient‖ embraces no more than
that which provides a platitude, which when the act done
suffices to accomplish the purpose intended in the facts
Digitally Signed By:PURAN O.M.P. (T) (COMM.) 99/2018                                    Page 28 of 32
and circumstances existing in a case, duly examined from
the viewpoint of a reasonable standard of a cautious man.
In this context, ―sufficient cause‖ means that the party
should not have acted in a negligent manner or there was
a want of bona fide on its part in view of the facts and
circumstances of a case or it cannot be alleged that the
party has ―not acted diligently‖ or ―remained inactive‖.
However, the facts and circumstances of each case must
afford sufficient ground to enable the court concerned to
exercise discretion for the reason that whenever the court
exercises discretion, it has to be exercised judiciously. The
applicant must satisfy the court that he was prevented by
any ―sufficient cause‖ from prosecuting his case, and
unless a satisfactory explanation is furnished, the court
should not allow the application for condonation of delay.
The court has to examine whether the mistake is bona fide
or was merely a device to cover an ulterior purpose.
(See Manindra Land and Building Corpn. Ltd. v. Bhutnath
Banerjee [AIR 1964 SC 1336] , Mata Din v. A.
, Parimal v. Veena [(2011) 3 SCC 545 : (2011) 2 SCC
(Civ) 1 : AIR 2011 SC 1150] and Maniben Devraj
Shah v. Municipal Corpn. of Brihan Mumbai [(2012) 5
11. The expression ―sufficient cause‖ should be given a
liberal interpretation to ensure that substantial justice is
done, but only so long as negligence, inaction or lack of
bona fides cannot be imputed to the party concerned,
whether or not sufficient cause has been furnished, can be
decided on the facts of a particular case and no
straitjacket            formula          is         possible.
(Vide Madanlal v. Shyamlal [(2002) 1 SCC 535 : AIR 2002
SC 100] and Ram Nath Sao v. Gobardhan Sao [(2002) 3
12. It is a settled legal proposition that law of limitation
may harshly affect a particular party but it has to be
applied with all its rigour when the statute so prescribes.
The court has no power to extend the period of limitation
on equitable grounds. ―A result flowing from a statutory
Digitally Signed By:PURAN O.M.P. (T) (COMM.) 99/2018                                   Page 29 of 32
provision is never an evil. A court has no power to ignore
that provision to relieve what it considers a distress
resulting from its operation.‖ The statutory provision may
cause hardship or inconvenience to a particular party but
the court has no choice but to enforce it giving full effect to
the same. The legal maxim dura lex sed lex which means
―the law is hard but it is the law‖, stands attracted in such
a situation. It has consistently been held that,
―inconvenience is not‖ a decisive factor to be considered
while interpreting a statute.
13. The statute of limitation is founded on public policy, its
aim being to secure peace in the community, to suppress
fraud and perjury, to quicken diligence and to prevent
oppression. It seeks to bury all acts of the past which have
not been agitated unexplainably and have from lapse of
time become stale. According to Halsbury's Laws of
England, Vol. 28, p. 266:
―605. Policy of the Limitation Acts.—The courts
have expressed at least three differing reasons
supporting the existence of statutes of limitations
namely, (1) that long dormant claims have more of
cruelty than justice in them, (2) that a defendant
might have lost the evidence to disprove a stale
claim, and (3) that persons with good causes of
actions should pursue them with reasonable
diligence.‖
An unlimited limitation would lead to a sense of insecurity
and uncertainty, and therefore, limitation prevents
disturbance or deprivation of what may have been
acquired in equity and justice by long enjoyment or what
may have been lost by a party's own inaction, negligence
or laches. (See Popat and Kotecha Property v. SBI Staff
Assn. [(2005) 7 SCC 510] , Rajender Singh v. Santa
and Pundlik            Jalam      Patil v. Jalgaon    Medium
15. The law on the issue can be summarised to the effect
that where a case has been presented in the court beyond
limitation, the applicant has to explain the court as to what
Digitally Signed By:PURAN O.M.P. (T) (COMM.) 99/2018                                    Page 30 of 32
was the ―sufficient cause‖ which means an adequate and
enough reason which prevented him to approach the court
within limitation. In case a party is found to be negligent,
or for want of bona fide on his part in the facts and
circumstances of the case, or found to have not acted
diligently or remained inactive, there cannot be a justified
ground to condone the delay. No court could be justified in
condoning such an inordinate delay by imposing any
condition whatsoever. The application is to be decided
only within the parameters laid down by this Court in
regard to the condonation of delay. In case there was no
sufficient cause to prevent a litigant to approach the court
on time condoning the delay without any justification,
putting any condition whatsoever, amounts to passing an
order in violation of the statutory provisions and it
tantamounts to showing utter disregard to the legislature.‖
42.     Considering the aforesaid law, it is seen that in the present case
initially the present petition was filed on 01.08.2018. The application
for condonation of delay came to be filed only on 22.09.2018. Perusal
of the application for condonation of delay shows that the petitioner
has miserably failed to show any „sufficient cause‟ for the delay
caused in filing the present petition. The petitioner did not make any
efforts for substitution of the arbitrator for three years and permitted
the limitation period to run out. No sufficient cause has been disclosed
by the petitioner for condonation of delay. The petitioner has tried to
cover up its lackadaisical approach in approaching this Court under
the garb of technical default of the mail account of the lawyer in
question and the vague explanation regarding case file of the present
case getting mixed up with other disposed of files. The said
explanation is totally ambiguous and does not disclose any „sufficient‟
cause to condone delay.
43.     In the light of the aforesaid discussion, it is held that the

application under Section 5 of the Limitation Act filed by petitioners
does not disclose any justifiable reasons for condoning delay. As
noticed above, the basic principle of Arbitration and Conciliation Act
is to achieve an expeditious and effective disposal of matters. Thus,
the very object of the Act shall be hampered if delay is condoned in
proceedings qua the arbitration, when no cause, least to say „sufficient
cause‟, has been disclosed by the petitioner. The conduct of the
petitioners in the present case demonstrates lack of bonafides and
complete indifference to the process of dispute resolution through the
mechanism of arbitration. By allowing application for condonation of
delay in the absence of any „sufficient cause‟, the very purpose of
expeditious resolution of dispute by way of arbitration, would stand
defeated.
44.     In view of the aforesaid discussion, it is held that there is no
sufficient cause for condoning delay in the present case. This Court is
aware that delay in filing in the present case is only five days.
However, it is not length of delay but „sufficient cause‟ which is the
criteria for condoning delay in approaching the Court, all the more so
in matters related to arbitration, taking into account the object of
speedy disposal sought to be achieved under the Arbitration and
Conciliation Act, 1996. Hence, application for condonation of delay is
dismissed.
45.     Accordingly, the present petition is dismissed.
