Through: Mr. Parag P. Tripathi, Sr. Adv. and
Mr. A.K. Sinha, Sr. Adv. with
1.      By this order, I shall consider the application being
EX.APPL.(OS) No.2933/2022. Suffice it to state that the execution
petition bearing OMP (ENF.) (COMM.) No.145/2021 was disposed of
by this Court on March 10, 2022, holding as under:
“40. …………………The award dated 11.05.2017 has
attained finality and cannot be allowed to remain as a
paper award, therefore, the judgment debtor is duty bound
to either divert its finds shown to be available in different
heads mentioned in the affidavit of 14.02.2022 after
seeking permission of the Central Government, if
necessary, or raise loans to satisfy the award.
41. Accordingly, out of the funds available under the head
Total DMRC Funds of Rs.1,452.10 cores, judgment debtor
is directed to keep aside amount of Rs.628 crore (Rs.514+
Rs.114 crore) towards statutory expenses as mentioned
herein above and from the remaining amount, part
payment of decreetal amount be made within two weeks.
42. For the remaining outstanding amount, judgment
debtor is directed to make the payments in two equal
instalments within two months. The first instalment shall
be paid on or before 30.04.2022 and the second instalment
shall be made on or before 31.05.2022.
43. With aforesaid directions, the present petition and
pending applications are accordingly disposed of.”
2.      The aforesaid order was the subject matter of a Civil Appeal
No.3657/2022 („appeal‟ in short) filed by the Decree Holder before the
Supreme Court, with regard to the findings of this Court in Paragraph
30 of the judgment which reads as under:
“30. Further, the plea whether the decree holder has a
right to claim interest over interest till the date of the
payment in terms of arbitral award in question or not, the
impugned arbitral award holds that the decree holder
shall be entitled to the interest from the date requisite
stamp duty is paid by it. In the present case, the requisite
stamp duty is said to have been made good by the decree
holder on 12.05.2017. Meaning thereby, the interest on the
awarded amount shall commence from 12.05.2017 till the
date of realization. There is no observation in the award
that interest, if not paid, shall be added in the principal
amount for future interest. Therefore, the claim of decree
holder that the outstanding interest has to be added in the
principal amount cannot be accepted.”
3.      The     appeal filed by      the   applicant  herein,   i.e.,  the
petitioner/decree-holder was dismissed.
4.      The submission of Mr. Sandeep Sethi, learned Senior Counsel
appearing for the applicant i.e., Delhi Airport Metro Express Pvt. Ltd.
(„DAMEPL‟, for short and hereinafter referred to as decree-holder /
DAMEPL interchangeably) is, despite the Court directing payment of
the awarded amount in the aforesaid terms, the Judgment debtor, i.e.,
the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation („DMRC‟, for short and hereinafter
referred to as DMRC / Judgment Debtor interchangeably) has paid only
a sum of ₹166.44 crores to DAMEPL on March 14, 2022, and has not
paid any amount thereafter. Hence, DAMEPL filed the present
application claiming the payment of ₹4427.41 crores (as on May 10,
2022) by attachment of, inter alia, bank accounts, fixed deposit, etc. of
DMRC. Further, interest continues to apply till the date of actual
payment by DMRC.
5.      It is his submission that DMRC has, contrary to the Arbitral
Award dated May 11, 2017 („Award‟, for short) and the Supreme Court
judgment dated September 09, 2021, upholding the Award, contended
that paragraph 30 of the Execution Judgement allegedly rejects the
present applicant‟s entitlement to all pre-award interest. He states the
attempt of DMRC is to read a single sentence de hors the remaining
Execution Judgement to mislead this Court. To buttress his arguments,
Mr. Sethi stated that in addition to the Termination Payment of
₹2782.33 crores, the Arbitral Tribunal has awarded ₹210.16 crores in
favour of the Decree Holder towards other claims/compensation as
well as ₹46.94 crores in favour of the respondent towards outstanding
Concession Fee. Pre-award interest has been granted in favour of the
Decree Holder only on Termination Payment. Other than Termination
Payment, on which there is pre-award as well as post-award interest at
SBI Prime Lending Rate („PLR‟, for short) +2% per annum, the interest
granted by the Arbitral Tribunal on other claims is @ 11% per annum
only from the date of payment of stamp duty. While DAMEPL has
paid therequisite stamp duty on May 12, 2017, DMRC is yet to do so.
6.      It is his case that paragraph 129 of the Award has expressly
granted interest at SBI PLR +2% per annum on Termination Payment
from August 07, 2013, in concurrence with the stipulation provided in
Article 29.8 of the Concession Agreement. The relevant Paragraph 129
of the Arbitral Award and Article 29.8 of the Concession Agreement
on which he placed reliance are reproduced as under:
“As such, we decide that the Termination payment will be
as per the provisions of Article 29.8 of CA and the interest
on the Termination payment will accrue from 7.8.2013
(i.e. the date 30 days after the demand of Termination
payment by OAMEPL on 08.07.2013).”
pursuant to this Agreement shall become due and payable
to the Concessionaire by DMRC within thirty days of a
demand being made by ·the Concessionaire with the
necessary particulars duly certified by the Statutory
Auditors. If DMRC fails to disburse the full Termination
Payment within 30 (thirty) days, the amount remaining
unpaid shall be disbursed along with interest at an
annualized rate of SBI PLR plus two per cent for the
period of delay on such amount.”
7.      This    grant  of   interest  by the Arbitral Tribunal on
Termination Payment has been upheld by the Supreme Court in its
Judgement dated September 09, 2021, titled Delhi Airport Metro
Express Pvt. Ltd. v. Delhi Metro Rail Corporation Ltd., SLP (Civil)
No. 4115/2019, relevant portion whereof is set out below:
“45. The Tribunal awarded interest in accordance with
the terms of the Concession Agreement on termination
payment. DMRC contended before the High Court that
the award in respect of interest had to be set aside on the
ground that it would result in unjust enrichment. After a
thorough consideration of Article 29.08 and Article
36.2.6.2 of the Concession Agreement, the High Court
has rightly refused to interfere with the findings by the
Tribunal relating to interest and we see no cause for
interference.”
8.     Paragraph 30 of the Execution Judgement dated March 10,
2022, does not disturb the express grant of pre-award interest
component on Termination Payment by the Arbitral Tribunal.
Contrary to DMRC‟s assertions, the pre-award interest component on
Termination Payment has been expressly affirmed by the Executing
Court in Paragraphs 26, 28 and 29 of the Execution Judgement,
which are extracted below:
11.05.2017 shows that the decree holder has been
awarded Termination Payment of Rs.2782.33 crores
with interest at the rate of SBI PLR +2% w.e.f.
07.08.2013 onwards. In addition, the tribunal has
awarded Rs. 147.52 crores with 11 % p.a. interest as
expenses incurred in running the line post-
termination; Rs. 62.07 crores with interest @11 %
p.a. as costs of decree holder's Bank Guarantee
wrongfully invoked and Rs.56.80 lakh with interest
@11 % p.a. towards security deposits.
28.      Regarding other claims, the decree holder has
made the following claims:
S.    Claim No.      Claim    Start  End      No. of   Interes Interest
No.                  amount date     date     Days     tRate   for the
29. A perusal of the aforesaid claims shows that
calculation for interest for the delayed payment of
Termination Payment has been done in accordance
with Article 29.8 of the Concession Agreement i.e.
SBI Prime Lending Rate + 2% and not generic Prime
Lending Rate + 2% as alleged and the rates of SBI
PLR have been taken for the period 07.08.2013 to
10.09.2021. The plea of judgment debtor that interest
has to be calculated keeping in mind the various
notifications issued by RBI changing the basis from
PLR to BLR and then to MCLR cannot be permitted
to be raised in execution proceedings. Moreover, the
Hon'ble Supreme Court in its judgment dated
09.09.2021 has categorically held that the interest
component is not required to be interfered with.”
9.      A bare perusal of the complete paragraph 30 read with
Paragraphs 26 to 29 of the Execution Judgement dated March 10,
2022, evidences that the sentence being relied upon by DMRC deals
with the post-award interest component commencing from May 12,
2017, i.e., the date of payment of stamp duty and that too on claims
other than Termination Payment. The aforesaid position is amply clear
from the following two sentences of Paragraph 30 extracted herein
“In the present case, the requisite stamp duty is said
to have been made good by the decree holder on
12.05.2017. Meaning thereby, the interest on the
awarded amount shall commence from 12.05.2017 till
the date of realization.”
10.       He stated that, contrary to the assertions of DMRC, the pre-
award interest on Termination Payment could not and has not been
disturbed by the Executing Court in Paragraph 30 of the Execution
Judgment. Hence, there was no requirement for DAMEPL to challenge
the same.
11.       DAMEPL had challenged a limited portion namely Paragraph
30 of the Execution Judgement by way of SLP (C) No.4901/2022
(Civil Appeal No.3657/2022). This grant of pre-award interest on
Termination Payment commencing from August 07, 2013, has been
unequivocally affirmed by the Supreme Court in its judgment dated
May 05, 2022, disposing of Civil Appeal No.3657/2022, the relevant
extract whereof is set out below:
“28. It is thus clear that the Arbitral Tribunal has
directed that the Termination payment would be as
per the provisions of the Concession Agreement and
the interest on the Termination payment would accrue
from 7th August, 2013 (i.e., the date 30 days after the
demand of Termination payment by DAMEPL on 8th
July, 2013). It is pertinent to note that though the
Arbitral Tribunal has found that the rates of interest
on loans taken by the appellant- DAMEPL are lower
than SBI PLR + 2%, it has observed that it was
beyond the competence of the Arbitral Tribunal to
change or alter or modify the provisions of the
therefore, has granted interest at an annualized rate
of SBI PLR + 2%, though it had found that the rate of
interest on which the loan was taken by the
appellant-DAMEPL was on the lower side.              The
Arbitral Tribunal, therefore, has rightly given
effect to the specific agreement between the parties
with regard to the rate of interest. We find that the
arbitral award has been passed in consonance with
the provisions as contained in clause (a) of
sub-section (7) of Section 31 of the 1996 Act and
specifically, in consonance with the phrase “unless
otherwise agreed by the parties”.
35. We are therefore of the considered view that in
view of the specific agreement between the parties,
the interest prior to the date of award so also after the
date of award will be governed by Article 29.8 of the
Concession Agreement, as has been directed by the
Arbitral Tribunal. The findings recorded by the
Arbitral Tribunal have reached finality in view of the
judgment and order dated 9th September, 2021,
passed by this Court in Civil Appeal No.5627 of 2021
[arising out of Special Leave Petition (Civil) No.4115
of 2019].”
12.       Further, he submitted that the contentions of DMRC are
merely an afterthought, misleading, and mala fide as all along,
including in the counter affidavit dated April 12, 2022, filed by DMRC
in Civil Appeal No.3657/2022, it has been DMRC‟s position that the
interest on Termination Payment granted as per Article 29.8 accrues
from August 07, 2013. Paragraphs 10, 14, and 16 of DMRC‟s counter-
affidavit in this regard are extracted below:
“10. It is apparent from the aforesaid observation in
the Arbitral Award, that the Arbitral Tribunal, did not
considered appropriate to interfere in the rate of
interest applicable on the payment of Termination
Payment, agreed to between the Parties in the
Concession Agreement under Article 29.8, though the
SBI PLR + 2% rate as mentioned to in Article 29.8
was much more than the rate of interest payable by
Petitioner on the loans taken by it for the project.
However, the Arbitral Tribunal directed that the
payment of Termination Payment should be as per the
provisions of Article 29.8 of Concession Agreement
and the interest on the Termination Payment would
accrue from 07.08.2013.
It is explicit that the Article 29.8 of the Concession
Agreement, laid down the agreement between the
parties in respect of interest payable on the
Termination Payment and period for which the said
interest would be payable. This period was mandated
to be the whole, “period of delay” which had
occurred between the expiry of the 30 days demand
notice and the date on which the payment of
Termination Payment is actually done by the
14. The Arbitral Award on the contrary had directed
the payment of interest on the Termination Payment
as per the provisions of Article 29.8 of the Concession
Agreement, and which direction would include the
whole period starting from the date of accrual of
cause of action, i.e. 07.08.2013 till the amount is
actually paid to by the Respondent.
The Execution Petition therefore, in as much as it
relates to enforcement of payment of Termination
Payment is liable to be dismissed as the amount
claimed under the Execution petition with respect to
termination payment does not reflect the express
relief granted by the Arbitral Award.
16. That as per the Annexure CC-1 to the Counter
Claim, the amount of interest of Rs. 194 cr. (Rs. 3470
– Rs. 3276) was sought between the date of
07.08.2013 (i.e. when the Termination payment has
become due) to 14.12.2013 (i.e., the date of the filing
of Counter Claim before the Arbitral Tribunal had
not prayed for any interest at the rate of SBI PLR +
2% on the combined amount of Principle amount due
+ interest due on such Principal amount till filling of
the Counter Claim i.e. Rs. 3,470 cr. In fact, explicitly
the future interest of SBI PLR + 2% was prayed for
only on the amount of Rs. 3276 Crore, which was the
principal Termination Amount due on the date of
accrual of cause of action, i.e. 07.08.2013.
In the instant case the petitioner has confined its
prayer to challenge only in limited portion of the
order dated 10.03.2022 i.e. para 30 of the impugned
order. The prayer of the decree holder as quoted in
paragraph 16 of the counter claim confines its claim
of the future interest at the rate of SBI PLR + 2% of
the amount of Rs.3276.00 Crore only which is the
principal termination amount not on the aggregate
sum of termination payment and interest.
It is well settled that a relief which is neither prayed
for nor sought for cannot be granted and thus the
petitioner/decree holder as per its own prayer is
entitled to future interest only on the principal
termination payment amount and not on the combined
amount of principal termination payment amount and
the interest accrued on the said principal termination
amount till the date of award. Even the arbitral
award directed the payment of interest on the
termination payment as per the provisions of Art. 29.8
of the Concession Agreement and the direction would
include the whole period starting from the date of
accrual of cause of action i.e. 07.08.2013 till the
amount is actually paid to by the respondent.”
13.     That apart, he states that DMRC has accepted the interest on
Termination Payment granted as per Article 29.8 of the Concession
Agreement from August 07, 2013, in its counter-affidavit dated April
12, 2022, (paragraphs 17 and 18) in the aforesaid appeal, and is now
taking a contrary stand to intentionally mislead this Court. In any
event, it is settled law that the court in execution proceedings cannot go
behind the decree.       In this regard, he has placed reliance on the
following judgments:
•       Vasudev Dhanjibhai Modi v. Rajabhai Abdul Rehman
and Others, (1970) 1 SCC 670;
•       Sneh Lata Goel vs. Pushplata and Others, (2019) 3
•       Lekh Raj (dead) through his LRs and Others v. Ranjit
Singh and Others, (2018) 12 SCC 750 and
•       Punjab State Civil Supplies Corpn. Ltd. v. Atwal Rice
14.       Further, the executing court has not set aside the grant of
interest on Termination Payments from August 07, 2013, which has
also been upheld by the Supreme Court vide order dated September 09,
2021. It is Mr. Sethi‟s submission that accordingly, on the awarded
Termination Payment of ₹2782.33 crores, the applicant is entitled to
pre-award interest from August 07, 2013 to May 11, 2017, at SBI
PLR+ 2 % per annum amounting to ₹1717.04 crores.
15.        He stated, that DMRC‟s calculation that only an amount of
₹2652.17 crores remains to be paid as on May 20, 2022, is erroneous,
as they have not considered ₹1717.04 crores towards the interest
component on the Termination Payment for the period between August
07, 2013 to May 11, 2017. Further, as per the summary of payments as
on May 20, 2022, DMRC has wrongly deducted an amount of ₹25.94
crores towards interest on the Concession Fee @11%. In this regard,
Mr. Sethi has relied upon Paragraph 111 of the Award which reads as
“Therefore, we award an amount of Rs. 46.94 crore to be
paid by DAMEPL to DMRC. Interest at the rate of 11
percent per annum will accrue from the date requisite
stamp duty is paid by DMRC.”
He stated, as is clear from the express directions in the award,
that DMRC‟s entitlement to interest on the claim of ₹46.94 crores
would arise only upon payment of stamp duty by DMRC, which has not
been done by DMRC as of yet.
16.       He has further submitted that DMRC‟s contention that
DAMEPL has not made adjustments as on the date of the payments by
DMRC and DAMEPL‟s interest computation thereafter is not made on
the balance principal amount after adjusting DMRC‟s payments, is
erroneous. In support of their contentions, the DMRC has relied upon
the figure of ₹2221.56 crores as set out in Document 5 annexed to this
application. However, the said document filed only sets out two equal
instalments of ₹2221.56 crores in case DMRC has made payments on
April 30, 2022 and May 31, 2022, in terms of the Execution Judgment.
No such payment has been made by the DMRC.                In fact, it is
Document 7 annexed to this application that actually sets out the
working in relation to the balance amounts to be paid by the DMRC as
on May 10, 2022, towards satisfaction of the decretal amount after
taking into consideration payments to be made by the DMRC till date.
17.       Mr. Sethi submitted that the total amount of interest on the
Termination Payment itself is much more than the total payment made
by the DMRC so far, i.e., ₹2444.87 crores. Even after adjusting this,
the interest on Termination Payment from mid-January, 2019 as well as
principal amounts and interest on other awarded claims remain
outstanding in full. Therefore, the question of adjustment of such
payments against the principal amount does not arise.
18.       That apart, Mr. Sethi has vehemently contested the
submissions made on behalf of DMRC regarding its funds and the
same cannot be attached. He stated that as per the Additional Affidavit
filed by DMRC on May 30, 2022, the DMRC‟s Net Funds after
adjusting the earnings from the operation of Airport Line would come
to ₹71.07 crores. DMRC has also stated on June 01, 2022, that even
this sum is needed for payment of salaries for the month of June 2022,
and hence cannot be attached. Effectively, DMRC is stating that it has
no funds to comply with the Execution Judgment, which amounts to
saying that it is practically bankrupt.
19.       He has also opposed the contention of DMRC that only its
earnings could be attached as other assets are protected by virtue of
Section 89 of the Metro Railways (Operation and Maintenance) Act,
2002 („MR Act‟, for short), by stating that Section 89 only prohibits
attachment of properties listed in Section 89 (1) of the MR Act and
DAMEPL is not seeking to attach any assets protected thereunder.
There is no restriction on the attachment of bank accounts or any
properties not being used or provided by a metro railway
administration for the purpose of traffic on its railway, stations,
workshops, or offices. Rigours of Section 89(1) of the MR Act will not
apply to all assets. Section 89(2) of the MR Act clarifies that Section
89(1) will not affect the power of any court to attach the earnings of the
metro railway in the execution of a decree.
20.       He submitted that money lying in any other form in the bank
accounts of DMRC, even if it was in the nature of an investment, and
which did not fall within the strict restriction under section 89(1) of the
MR Act (which is exhaustive in nature) would not be prevented from
the rigours of attachment by a court in execution. He also submitted
that DMRC's statement has funds under the three heads “Total DMRC
Funds”, “Total Project Funds” and “Total Other Funds”. DMRC has
asserted that only “Total DMRC Funds” were amenable to attachment,
as other funds did not belong to DMRC. This contention that the funds
lying with DMRC for project works and other works entrusted by
various state governments and agencies cannot be attached, according
to Mr. Sethi is meritless and deserves outright rejection.
21.       It is stated that DMRC's assertions are contrary to the express
directions in Execution Judgment whereby this Court has directed
utilisation of money lying under all three heads, namely Total DMRC
Funds, Total Project Funds, and Total Other Funds for payments of
balance decretal amounts. The relevant portion of the judgment is as
“40. According to the aforesaid affidavit, as on
14.02.2022, the total funds available with the judgment
debtor under the head Total DMRC Funds is Rs.1,452.10
cores; under the head Total Project Funds is Rs.2681.29
and under the head Total Other Funds is Rs.1,560/-.
However, as per details of funds shown in Annexure-A in
the affidavit dated 10.01.2022 filed on behalf of judgment
debtor, a sum of Rs.514 crore is committed to the salary,
medical and post retiral benefits of employees and Rs.114
crore is the portion of security deposit on smart cards,
which is refundable to the commuters. In the considered
opinion of this Court, the said amount i.e. Rs.514+
Rs.114 crore has to be kept aside for the aforesaid
purpose, however, from the remaining amount available
in different bank accounts of judgment debtor as well as
under other heads, the payments towards decreetal
amount has to be made. The award dated 11.05.2017 has
attained finality and cannot be allowed to remain as a
paper award, therefore, the judgment debtor is duty
bound to either divert its finds shown to be available in
different heads mentioned in the affidavit of 14.02.2022
after seeking permission of the Central Government, if
necessary, or raise loans to satisfy the award.”
22.      Further,   Mr.    Sethi   also   stated     that    the  different
allocations/alleged encumbrances made by DMRC for utilising money
already lying in their bank accounts, which are intended expenditures
not already incurred or are contractual liabilities, are irrelevant and are
liable to be attached. Attempts by DMRC to evade the execution of
the Award is apparent from the fact that DMRC is, contrary to the law,
prioritising such liabilities over making payments in accordance with
the Execution Judgement.
23.      That apart, it is submitted that the funds of DMRC as on May
19, 2022, showed a total of ₹1009.50 crores as available funds which
are liable to be attached. Even as per the Additional Affidavit filed by
DMRC on May 30, 2022, the funds of DMRC as on May 27, 2022,
are ₹960.62 crores, which ought to be attached towards the
satisfaction of decretal sums.
24.      According to him, the dubious conduct of DMRC is apparent
from its actions in so far as it has diverted an amount of ₹3131.89
crores lying with it for construction of Metro Projects in Delhi and
elsewhere, purportedly acting on a letter dated April 27, 2022, of the
Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs, Government of India. As a
result, the bank balances of DMRC now stand depleted at only
₹960.62 crores as on May 27, 2022, against ₹5694.25 crores on
25.      Despite the Execution Judgment dated March 10, 2022, not
having been challenged by DMRC, which directed payment of the
outstanding decretal amount in two equal instalments by April 30,
2022 and May 31, 2022, respectively, and the Execution Judgment
being in operation, DMRC has now submitted that time may be given
to DMRC to arrange bank loans to pay the decretal amount.
26.      In this regard, he stated that it is the contention of DMRC that;
(a) DMRC is in advanced negotiations with banks to raise loan to pay
the remaining amount; (b) the Central Govt has refused sanction to
divert funds available with DMRC to pay towards the decree; (c)
DMRC is allegedly in dire financial straits and any further recovery
would lead to stoppage of operations of DMRC, thereby affecting the
public interest. DMRC‟s request for further time is not bona fide as
the Award was passed on May 11, 2017, and upheld by the Supreme
Court on September 09, 2021. No action has been taken by DMRC for
raising funds for almost nine months after the judgment dated
September 09, 2021, of the Supreme Court, upholding the decree. In
fact, even as per reply to EA No.2933/2022, the first step taken by
DMRC appears to be only on April 06, 2022. Further, DMRC has
called for bids from banks only in May 2022.
27.      That apart, he stated that DMRC ought to have initiated steps
to arrange funds immediately after the Supreme Court judgment dated
September 09, 2021, which it failed to do. DMRC has further orally
submitted during the hearing on June 01, 2022, before this Court that
attaching the said amount of ₹71.07 crores being meagre, no purpose
would be served with attaching the same and hence the same also
ought not to be attached.
28.      He alleges this is an attempt to turn the orders of the Arbitral
Tribunal, this Court, and the Supreme Court into mere paper decrees.
In this regard, he has placed reliance on the judgments in the cases of
Satyawati v. Rajinder Singh and Anr., (2013) 9 SCC 491, and
Subhash Agarwal v. Abhishek Andley and Ors., (2019) 265 DLT
29.      It is his submission that the Execution Judgment dated March
10, 2022, being still in operation not having been challenged, DMRC
now cannot be allowed to seek further time to arrange for bank loans
in order to pay the decretal amount. Such a request by the DMRC is
not bona fide as the award was passed on May 11, 2017, and was
upheld by the Supreme Court on September 09, 2021.
30.     The submission of DMRC regarding the deficiency of
resources to satisfy the awarded amount, also goes contrary to the
records available, as its total revenue for the financial year 2019-2020
was approximately ₹7015 crores.         Other bank balances (deposits)
amounted to ₹10,280 crores. DMRC being a completely sovereign
entity having total assets of ₹78,439 crores, will have no difficulty in
raising debts for this purpose. Therefore, the conduct of DMRC
shows that it has no intention to comply with the Execution Judgment.
That apart, Mr. Sethi has also contested the averment of DMRC that
its operations could be affected if its accounts were to be attached.
Merely because the Judgment debtor is a sovereign entity, it cannot
claim any differential treatment and refuse to honour a decree, more
so, when the Supreme Court has upheld the Arbitral Award.         In this
regard he has referred to the Judgment in the case of Pam
Developments Pvt. Ltd. v. State of West Bengal, (2019) 8 SCC 112.
31.     Mr. Sethi has also submitted that the promotor company of the
applicant, had lent out money to the applicant company by taking
loans from public sector banks. As the promoter company has not
been able to pay its creditors owing to the non-reimbursement of funds
from the applicant, it is facing liquidation proceedings, debt recovery
proceedings, and other legal actions under the SARFAESI Act, 2002,
Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016, Negotiable Instruments Act,
1881, etc.
32.     Considering the fact that the daily interest on the decretal
amount is ₹1.15 crores and the incremental interest from September
10, 2021 to May 31, 2022, is ₹287.06 crores, it is in the interest of
both the parties that the Supreme Court vide order January 24, 2022,
in SLP (Civil) No. 770/2022 directed as follows:
“We request the High Court to take up the matter at the
earliest and dispose of the Execution Application without
any further delay, as consequences of the pendency of the
said application are detrimental to the interest of the
petitioner as well as the respondent”.
33.     Reliance has been placed on the judgment of the Supreme
Court in the case of Rahul S. Shah v. Jinendra Kumar Gandhi,
(2021) 6 SCC 418, to contend that execution proceedings must be
disposed of within six months from the date of filing.
34.     Mr. Sethi has prayed, that DMRC not be granted any further
time and be directed to immediately make full payment towards the
balance decretal sums of ₹4451.63 crores as on May 31, 2022, along
with further interest up to the date of actual payment, for which the
bank accounts and amounts lying in the credit of such bank accounts
of DMRC along with all its fixed deposits, other financial investments
and daily revenue / earnings be attached towards satisfaction of the
decretal amount.
35.     Mr. Parag P. Tripathi, learned Senior Counsel appearing for
the DMRC / Judgment debtor has stated the instant application filed
by the DAMEPL praying for an order of attachment of bank accounts
of the DMRC including the fixed assets to the extent of ₹4427.41
crores, i.e., the amount which is calculated as payable by DMRC
under the Arbitral Award up to May 10, 2022. Admittedly, ₹2444.87
crores have already been paid in the escrow account of the decree
holder, and the remaining amount to be paid is ₹2652.17 crores. He
has admitted that this Court vide order dated March 10, 2022, had
directed DMRC to either divert the funds shown to be available under
different heads mentioned in the affidavit of February 14, 2022, after
seeking permission of the Central Government, if necessary or raise
loans to satisfy the Award. It was further directed to keep aside a sum
of ₹628 crores from the amount of ₹1452 crores available under the
head of DMRC Funds and from the remaining amount, make part
payment of the decretal amount within two weeks.
36.     Mr. Tripathi stated that DMRC had agreed to deposit a sum of
₹600 crores, which was recorded in the Order of this Court dated
February 21, 2022, out of the “Total DMRC Funds”. Out of the
balance of ₹224 crores (₹1452 crores - ₹628 crores - ₹600 crores), a
sum of ₹166.44 crores remained in the running account as on the date
of passing of the judgment dated March 10, 2022, after defraying
running expenditure. The said sum was also paid on March 14, 2022.
37.     On April 06, 2022, and April 26, 2022, permission was sought
by DMRC from the Central Government seeking sanction under
Section 89 of the MR Act for use of the funds lying under the head of
Total Project Funds and Total Other Funds for the satisfaction of the
Arbitral Award / decree. The said sanction was declined by the Central
Government on April 13, 2022 and April 27, 2022, respectively.
38.     Mr. Tripathi has submitted that quotations / proposals have
been invited for raising Capex Loan from various banks for payment
of the amount due and payable to DAMEPL under the Award dated
May 11, 2017. Banks have asked for extending the deadline for filing
bids till June 10, 2022, to present their bids as a Consortium. DMRC
expects to process the bids of the banks by July 10, 2022 and expects
signing of loan documents by August 15, 2022.
39.      He has argued that Section 89 of the MR Act is in the nature
of statutory protection conferred by the Parliament in recognition of
the function carried out by the DMRC in the public interest. As per
Section 89 of the MR Act, only “Earnings” of DMRC would be open
for attachment, and not the amounts held by DMRC in trust for
construction of Metro Projects in NCR and elsewhere. “Earnings” are
to be contradistinguished with “Revenue”, the latter being the total
turnover of the DMRC in a particular year, out of which expenses are
to be defrayed to reach the amount of “Earnings”. If the whole amount
of Revenue is liable to be attached then the statutory scheme of
granting protection to operation and maintenance assets under the MR
Act, so that the public carriage services can continue, would be
defeated. Further, Section 60 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908
(„CPC‟, for short) contemplates that only such properties belonging to
the Judgment debtor which are under its disposing power are liable to
be attached in execution. As is clear from the DMRC affidavit dated
May 30, 2022, only a sum of ₹71.07 crores, is the amount over which
DMRC has disposing power as on May 27, 2022. But even the said
sum would have to be used to defray expenses towards salaries for the
month of June 2022. Thus, any attachment of funds lying in the Bank
Accounts of DMRC would lead to the stoppage of operation and
maintenance activities of DMRC and halting of public carriage
activities of DMRC.
40.      Mr. Tripathi has vehemently contested the submission of
Mr. Sethi that the DMRC had diverted sums amounting to ₹3131
crores. He states that the said contention is wholly misplaced for the
1. The said sums were advanced to DMRC for the specific
purpose of carrying out development work of Phase III & IV
of Delhi Metro as well as other Metro Projects. The DMRC,
therefore, had no disposing power over the said funds as
they were held in trust for government agencies that had
advanced the said sums.
2. It was noting this fact that this Court in the order dated
March 10, 2022, had directed payment only out of the funds
available under the head „Total DMRC funds‟ after keeping
aside ₹628 crores towards salaries and statutory dues.
3. This contention of diversion of funds was not raised before
the Supreme Court in Civil Appeal No. 3657/2022 filed
against the Judgment of this Court on March 10, 2022. The
said findings have thus attained finality.
4. Further, it was in the light of Section 89 of the MR Act that
the Central Government wrote to the DMRC on April 13,
2022, and April 27, 2022, stating that such sums were only
to be used for the purpose for which they have been
earmarked and directed such sums be returned to the
government agencies which had released the said funds.
41.     It is also stated that Canara Bank has preferred an O.A. No.
116/2022 before the Debt Recovery Tribunal, Mumbai wherein a
prayer has been sought for attachment of the amount of ₹700 crores
receivable by Defendant No.1 therein (Reliance Infrastructure Ltd.)
from DRMC under the award dated May 11, 2017.
42.     Further, he submitted that the Paragraph 30 of the judgment
dated March 10, 2022, has been challenged by the applicant in the
Supreme Court in Civil Appeal No. 3657/2022, which was dismissed
by the Supreme Court by stating that there is no error in the
observations made by the learned Single Judge in Paragraph 30. The
said judgment has thus attained finality, and as such the applicant
cannot be allowed to argue that the interest shall not be calculated from
the date of payment of requisite stamp duty, i.e., May 12, 2017, but
from August 07, 2013.
43.     He has also refuted the contention that the DMRC has not
complied with the direction made in paragraph 41 of the judgment
dated March 10, 2022, as a sum of ₹600 crores was paid to the
applicant on February 22, 2022, in compliance with the undertaking
recorded in the order dated February 21, 2022. This aspect has also
been clarified in the order of this Court dated May 20, 2022 passed in
Review Petition No. 107/2022. The balance sum of ₹166.44 crores
lying in the account after defrayment of Operations and Maintenance
expenses was remitted on March 14, 2022. He seeks further time to
make the payments as per the Arbitral Award.
44.     Having heard the learned counsel for the parties and perused
the record and the written submissions filed by the counsel for the
parties, as stated above, I am considering the application being
EX.APPL.(OS) No.2933/2022, which has been filed with the following
“In view of the aforesaid facts and circumstances of the
present case, it is, therefore, most respectfully and
humbly prayed that this Hon'ble Court may be pleased
a)       Pass an ex-parte ad interim order of
attachment of the Bank Accounts of the Judgment
Debtor, including its fixed deposits, to the extent of Rs.
4427.41 crores, the amount which is calculated as
payable under the Award by DMRC up to 10.05.2022
(considering the payments made by DMRC till date);
b)       Pass an order directing the Judgement Debtor
to declare through an affidavit the particulars of its
bank accounts and the amounts available therein, as
well as the particulars of its fixed deposits and other
financial investments/assets as on date;
c)       Pass such other further order/orders in
favour of the Decree Holder which this Hon'ble Court
may deem fit and proper in the interest of justice.”
45.     It is a fact that the execution petition was disposed of on March
10, 2022, the directions of which have already been reproduced in
paragraph 1 above. It is also a fact that the order dated March 10,
2022, was the subject matter of a challenge in Civil Appeal
No.3657/2022 to the extent of Paragraph 30 of the order dated March
10, 2022. The appeal was dismissed by the Supreme Court on May 05,
2022. The review petition filed by the Judgment debtor seeking review
of the order dated March 10, 2022, has been dismissed by this Court
vide order dated May 20, 2022.
46.      The submission of Mr. Sethi is that, after the directions given
in the order dated March 10, 2022, only an amount of ₹166.44 crores
has been paid to the decree-holder on March 14, 2022. The DMRC has
not paid any amount thereafter.
47.      An issue has been raised by Mr. Tripathi by relying upon
Paragraph 30 of the judgment dated March 10, 2022, to state that the
applicant / decree holder cannot be allowed to argue that the interest
shall not be calculated from the date of payment of the requisite stamp
duty i.e., May 12, 2017, but from August 07, 2013. This submission of
Mr. Tripathi relating to termination payment, is not appealing.            It
appears the attempt is to reargue an issue that has attained finality with
the upholding of the Award by the Supreme Court on September 09,
2021. The Arbitral Tribunal has on the issue of termination payment
which aspect has been noted by the Supreme Court in Paragraph 27 of
its judgment, has held as under:
“129. Therefore, the Termination Payment to DAMEPL
works out to Rs. 983.02 + Rs. 1260.73 +Rs. 538.58 crores
= Rs. 2782.33 crores. As regards rate of interest on the
Termination payment, the stipulation of Article 29.8 of CA
is at an annualized rate of SBI PLR +2%. We have noted
from the financial documents of DAMEPL (Pg 299 of
CD11-Supplementary reply of DMRC dated 22.2.2014 to
the Counter Claim of the Respondent) that the secured
loan taken by DAMEPL carries the rate of interest of 12.
75% on Rupee Term Loan and is in the range of 4.83% to
5.6% for Foreign Currency Loan. Although the rates of
interest on loans taken by DAMEPL are lower than SBI
PLR +2%, we are of the opinion that it is beyond the
competence of the Tribunal to change or alter or modify
the provisions of CA. As such, we decide that the
Termination payment will be as per the provisions of
Article 29.8 of CA and the interest on the Termination
payment will accrue from 7.8.2013 (i.e. the date 30 days
after the demand of Termination payment by OAMEPL on
08.07.2013). In terms of Article 29.9 of CA, this amount
shall be paid by DMRC by way of credit to the Escrow
Account, details of which are available in Annexure CC-4
of the Counter Claim. We award accordingly.”
48.     In Paragraph 30 of the judgment dated March 10, 2022, of this
Court of which a reference has been made by Mr. Tripathi, as is clear,
is with regard to the plea: “whether the decree holder has a right to
claim interest over interest till the date of payment in terms of Arbitral
Award”. It was this issue, which was negated by the Supreme Court in
its judgment dated May 05, 2022. In this regard, I may state that the
issue, which has been raised now by Mr. Tripathi has been dealt with
by this Court in paragraph 29 of its judgment dated March 10, 2022,
which reads as under:
“29. A perusal of the aforesaid claims shows that
calculation for interest for the delayed payment of
Termination Payment has been done in accordance with
Article 29.8 of the Concession Agreement i.e. SBI Prime
Lending Rate + 2% and not generic Prime Lending Rate
+ 2% as alleged and the rates of SBI PLR have been
taken for the period 07.08.2013 to 10.09.2021. The plea
of judgment debtor that interest has to be calculated
keeping in mind the various notifications issued by RBI
changing the basis from PLR to BLR and then to MCLR
cannot be permitted to be raised in execution
proceedings. Moreover, the Hon'ble Supreme Court in its
judgment dated 09.09.2021 has categorically held that the
interest component is not required to be interfered with.”
49.     Mr. Sethi is justified in referring to the counter affidavit filed
by the DMRC / Judgment debtor before the Supreme Court, more
particularly Paragraphs 10, 14, and 16 which I have reproduced in
50.      One of the submissions of Mr. Sethi is with regard to the
recovery of the outstanding amount from the funds other than the
DMRC funds available with the DMRC. He had also opposed the
contention of DMRC that only its earnings could be attached as other
assets are protected by virtue of Section 89 of the MR Act. His
submission was also, that the money lying in any other form in the
bank accounts of DMRC, even if it is in the nature of investment which
did not fall within the strict restriction under Section 89 of the MR Act
would not be prevented from attachment by a Court in execution.
51.      Mr. Tripathi has opposed the plea by stating that Section 89 of
the MR Act is in the nature of statutory protection conferred by the
Parliament in recognition of the functions carried out by DMRC in the
public interest. He also stated that as per Section 89 of the MR Act
only earnings of DMRC would be open for attachment and not the
amounts held by DMRC in Trust for construction of metro projects in
NCR and elsewhere. In other words, any attachment of funds lying in
the bank accounts of DMRC would lead to the stoppage of operation
and maintenance activities of DMRC and halting of public carriage
activities of DMRC.
52.       Similar submissions were made by the applicant / decree
holder before this Court which resulted in the order dated March 10,
2022. The Court in Paragraph 40 gave an option to the DMRC /
Judgment debtor either to divert its funds shown to be available in
different heads after seeking the permission of the Central Government
or raise loans to satisfy the Award. It is the case of the DMRC /
Judgment debtor that the Central Government has not granted sanction
for diversion of funds in terms of their communications dated April 13,
2022 and April 27, 2022, respectively.
53.     Rather the case of the DMRC / Judgment debtor is that in terms
of the liberty granted for raising loans, the DMRC has called for
quotations / proposals for raising Capex loan from various banks for
payment of the amount due and payable to the applicant / decree holder
and the DMRC expects to process the bids of the banks by July 10,
2022, and expects the signing of loan documents by August 15, 2022.
He, during his oral submissions, did state that the matter be posted in
the early part of August 2022 to ensure payment of the outstanding
amount to the applicant / decree holder.
54.     Noting the submissions made by the counsels, this Court is of
the view that the challenge to the order dated March 10, 2022, by the
petitioner was decided on May 05, 2022, and action has been initiated
by the DMRC, as noted above, time should be granted to DMRC to
ensure payment of the outstanding amount to the applicant/decree
holder on or before August 05, 2022. It is ordered accordingly.
55.     The DMRC / Judgment debtor shall file an affidavit, giving the
break up of the payments made to satisfy the award within one week
thereafter.
56.     Renotify the application on August 16, 2022.
