This criminal revision petition has been preferred claiming
the following reliefs:
“It is, therefore, most respectfully prayed that this revision
petition may kindly be allowed and the order dated 06.03.2019
passed by the learned Family Court, in Criminal Misc. Case
No.101/2016 (Sarvjeet Kaur & Ors. Vs. Lakhveer Singh) may
kindly be quashed and set aside and the respondent No.2 also
ordered to be directed to pay maintenance of Rs.10,000/- to
humble petitioner.”
Learned     counsel    for   the    petitioner submits     that   the
petitioner-wife alongwith her two children, are living separately,
and thus, they sought maintenance, which was partly allowed and
the children were granted maintenance to a sum of Rs.3000/- per
(2 of 3)            [CRLR-629/2019]
month each. The maintenance was not granted to the petitioner-
wife as she knew tailoring job and was stitching clothes for the
ladies at domestic level.
Learned counsel for the respondent No.2-husband opposes
the submissions on the ground that the respondent No.2-husband
is a welder and does not have any source of income.
On being asked, it was also reported that the maintenance
awarded to the children has not been paid after the impugned
order was passed.
This Court, after hearing the submissions and analyzing the
record of the case, is of the firm opinion that even if the
petitioner-wife is stitching clothes domestically then also she is
entitled to get the maintenance. The respondent No.2-husband is
a welder, which is almost like a skilled workman, and thus, it
cannot be presumed that he is not earning sufficiently to maintain
the petitioner-wife, even if the petitioner-wife has some income
source, then also there are three family members whom the
respondent No.2-husband is liable to maintain. In the given
circumstances, it is a fit case for grant of maintenance to the
In view of the above, the present revision petition is allowed,
the impugned order dated 06.03.2019 passed by the learned
Family Court in Criminal Misc. Case No.101/2016 (Sarvjeet Kour
and Ors. Vs. Lakhveer Singh) is quashed to the extent of denial of
maintenance to the petitioner-wife and it is directed that the
petitioner-wife shall also be paid the monthly maintenance to a
sum of Rs.3000/- from the date of filing of the initial application.
However, it is made clear that the monthly maintenance of the
(3 of 3)        [CRLR-629/2019]
children awarded earlier shall remain as per the impugned order
All pending applications stand disposed of.
