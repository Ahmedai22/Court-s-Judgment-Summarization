The recent attack on an undertrial inside a Trial Court in
Rohini (Delhi) by two assailants dressed up as Advocates, isa
harbinger of our worst nightmare coming true. Similar attacks
have taken place, several times in the District Courts in Madhya
Pradesh where security and security consciousness is zero. The
difference between the incidents that have taken place in our
District  Courts  and   the   Rohini  episode is   the  manner     of
execution.   In MP,   the   assailants  enter the   District  Court
complex as members of the public and execute their plan. In
Rohini, the assailants entered as Advocates, and that made all
the difference.
"Advocates, the Print spoke to said there is no frisking at
the entry points,   ID cards are not checked,         cars are not
inspected and the metal detectors don't work. All one needs to
enter the   premises is a     black coat and     a  white   shirt...."
(extracted from the Print from an article on the Rohini incident).
As in the past, our wisdom dawns ex post facto. It is in
this backdrop that we feel it is essential for the courts in
Madhya Pradesh to introduce an RFID based identification
system for Advocates, which can verify their identity seamlessly,
without necessitating them to stop and prove their credentials
while entering the court premises. This SOP is being drawn up
to put in place a discipline to be followed by the learned
members of the legal profession so as to ensure their own safety
and security and also assist in making the courts a safer place.
The security of the Courts can be described in alliterative
phraseology as the 3P's; Perimeter, Proximate and Personal.
