Dated this the 10th day of September, 2021
The petitioner is the defendant in O.S.No. 61
of 2019 on the files of the Sub Court, Sulthan
Bathery. The suit is filed, seeking to cancel two
assignment deeds registered by the respondent in
favour   of   the  petitioner.    After   the   petitioner
filing his written statement, respondent amended
the    plaint.    Thereupon,    the   petitioner     filed
additional written statement. Later, when the case
was    listed    for   trial,   the    petitioner    filed
I.A.No.15 of     2021 seeking    to amend     the written
statement.     Plaintiff    opposed    the   application,
contending      that    the    amendment     is    totally
misconceived and     filed only     for the    purpose of
protracting the suit. The trial court dismissed
the amendment application vide Ext. P5. Hence, the
original petition.
2.   The  amendment     application     was   dismissed
finding that the attempt of the petitioner is to
withdraw the admissions in the written statement
and   to  incorporate     new    contentions.     The   trial
court also found the petitioner guilty of wanton
negligence and callousness.
3.   Sri.R.Sudhish,      learned   Counsel     for   the
petitioner    assailed     the   findings   and    submitted
that   the   purpose    of   amendment    is   to   withdraw
certain portions from the written statement and to
incorporate      identical       averments     with     minor
modifications. According to the learned Counsel,
the amendment is only clarificatory in nature. As
regards the finding that the petitioner is guilty
of callous negligence, it is submitted that the
suit was listed for trial on 04.08.2021, whereas
the    application     for    amendment    was    filed    on
29.7.2021.    The  trial    having    not  commenced,     the
proviso   to   Order   VI  Rule   17,  interdicting   the
court from allowing the amendment, in the absence
of due diligence by the party, is not applicable.
Moreover, the Court should have taken a liberal
approach, as it was the written statement that was
sought   to   be   amended   and   not  the  plaint.   In
support of the contention, the following decisions
are relied on; Pavithran v. Narayanan [1997 (2)
KLT 271], Estralla Rubber v. Dass Estate (P) Ltd
[(2001)    8   SCC   97],  Ram   Niranjan   Kajaria   and
another v. Sheo Prakash Kajaria and others [2015
KHC 4631] and Mohinder Kumar Mehra v. Roop Rani
Mehra and others [(2018) 2 SCC 132].
4.   Sri.K.M.Firoz,     learned   Counsel  for   the
respondent     contended    that   the   amendments,   if
allowed, would change the nature and scope of the
suit.   According     to   the   learned   Counsel,   the
amendments are not clarificatory or explanatory in
nature,    but   are   intended   to   set  up  a   case,
hitherto not pleaded. To buttress the argument,
particular emphasis was laid on the portions in
the amendment     where the    percentage of    share is
sought to be changed from 22.5% to 32.5%,         payment
in  the   name   of   the  power   of  attorney   of  the
defendant changed to payment to the defendant and
the term 'adjustment' replaced with 'payment'. It
is pointed out that the application for amendment
was   filed   after    the  respondent    had  filed  his
affidavit in lieu of chief examination and trial
commenced from the date on which the affidavit in
lieu of chief examination was filed. There being
no whisper in the amendment application about the
due diligence factor, the trial court was fully
justified in dismissing the amendment application.
In  support    of  his   contentions,   learned   Counsel
relied   on   the   decisions   in   Modi   Spinning  and
Weaving Mills Co.Ltd v. M/s.Ladha Ram and Company
[AIR 1977 SC 680], Heera Lal v. Kalyan Mal and
others   [(1998)    1  SCC   278]  and  Sasikala  T.V  v.
Swami and others v. Kiran Appaso Swami and others
5.   In the impugned order, after referring to
the relevant portions of the written statement and
the amendment application, the trial court came to
the   conclusion    that   certain   material  admissions
are    sought    to   be    withdrawn    and  new   facts
introduced. The relevant portions of the written
statement and the amendment application has been
extracted in the impugned order. Having heard the
learned    Counsel      and   having    scrutinised   the
extracted portion in the order, I find no reason
to  arrive    at  a   different   conclusion.   More  so,
since   even   in   the   lengthy   explanations  in  the
additional written statement, the petitioner had
not mentioned about the contentions now sought to
be incorporated.
6.   In Ram Niranjan Kajaria, the Apex Court
held that even though an attempt to wholly resile
from    an   admission   cannot    be   permitted,    the
admission can be clarified or explained by way of
amendment    and   the  basis   of   admission    can  be
attacked in a substantive proceedings. This court
in Pavithran also held that if an admission could
be   explained     away  or    can   be    rescinded   or
superseded,     there   cannot    be   any    prohibition
against such admission being allowed to be taken
away by amending the pleading. The aforementioned
decisions would have applied, had the attempt of
the petitioner been to only explain or clarify the
admission. On the contrary, the attempt here is to
withdraw the admissions and set forth an entirely
new   case.   As  held  by  the   Apex   Court   in  Modi
Spinning and Weaving Mills (supra), the defendant
cannot be permitted to change his case completely
and substitute     an entirely    new case.    Here, the
the amendments would, not only have the effect of
the defendant making inconsistent and alternative
pleadings, but also of completely displacing          the
admissions made in the written statement. Even the
most liberal approach towards amendment of written
statements will not justify the approval of such
an application.
7.    The  sequence  of   events  reveal  that   the
petitioner had been permitted to file additional
written statement.     Thereafter, he waited till the
case was listed for trial before filing the second
amendment    application.   Going   by  the  order,   the
application for amendment was filed on 2.8.2021
and  considered    by  the  court   when  the  suit   was
taken up for evidence. There is no dispute to the
fact   that    the  amendment   application   was   filed
after the plaintiff had submitted his affidavit in
lieu    of   chief   examination.    According   to   the
learned Counsel for the petitioner, the amendment
application having been filed before examination
of parties had commenced, the interdiction under
Order 6 Rule 17 CPC is not attracted. On the other
hand, learned Counsel for the respondent contended
that trial had commenced from the day on which the
plaintiff had submitted his affidavit in lieu of
chief   examination.    Therefore,    it   was   incumbent
upon the petitioner to have satisfied the trial
court that he could not have filed the application
earlier, in spite of due diligence. In Sasikala
(supra),     this    Court,    after   considering     the
precedents,     held   that    the   trial   in    a  suit
commences on the date on which the affidavit in
lieu of examination in chief of a party or his
witness   is   filed   for  the   purpose   of   recording
evidence. In Mohinda Kumar (supra), the amendment
application was filed before evidence was led by
the plaintiff and hence, the Apex Court held that
the amendment application was filed            before the
commencement of trial. In the case at hand, the
affidavit in lieu of chief examination was filed
prior to the filing of application for amendment
and therefore, even if it is accepted that the
application was filed before the date fixed for
leading evidence, the interdiction in the proviso
to Order VI Rule 17 will apply.
8.   Estralla Rubber is cited to contend that
the Apex Court has held the delay in making an
application for amendment, by itself, cannot be a
ground for rejection of the application, unless
serious prejudice is caused to the other party and
accrued rights taken away. It may be pertinent to
note   that   in  the   case    at  hand,   the  suit  was
included in the provisional list for the month of
August,   2021   on   the  request    of   the  plaintiff,
since he is working abroad. The plaintiff had come
down for the purpose of giving evidence and also
submitted     his   affidavit      in    lieu   of   chief
examination. The amendment application was filed
thereafter,    just    prior   to   the  date   fixed for
trial. Being so,       there cannot be any doubt that
substantial was caused to the plaintiff.
9.   Considering the nature of the amendments
and   the   stage    at   which    the  application   for
amendment was     filed, the     trial court    was fully
justified    in rejecting the application.
In   the   result,    the    original   petition  is
dismissed.
