The facts in all these Writ Petitions are common and the issues involved are also
common and hence, this Court is taking up all the Writ Petitions together and passing this
2.The petitioner is the proprietor of M/s. Meena Advertisers which is an advertising
concern. The South Asian Federation Games (hereinafter referred to as ‘SAF games’) were
held at Chennai during December 1995. The Government of Tamil Nadu made elaborate
arrangements to conduct the event in a grand manner. The Government thought it fit to
utilise these games and make a viable economic proposition by commercialisation of the
events and to involve private players. In the said process, M/s.Times TV was appointed as
the marketing agency and they were expected to obtain sponsorship for television, instadia
publicity, sole status appointment such as mineral water supplies, official caterer etc. They
were expected to pay 30% of the gross revenue generated through commercialisation and
for all direct revenue sources through SAF games organisers. M/s. Times TV was permitted to
retain 5% commission.
3.A letter of appointment was issued to M/s. Times TV on 2.11.1995. It seems that
M/s. Times TV were not able to get any concrete financial commitment and therefore, it was
decided to call for quotations from leading marketing agents in Madras city and appoint
marketing agent to carry on with the decision taken by the Government.
4.The petitioner participated in the tender process and submitted the highest bid
amount. Thereafter, the petitioner was called for negotiations and was asked to improve the
offer and ultimately the petitioner guaranteed a sum of Rs.3 Crores for commercialisation of
the games subject to certain rights given to the petitioner. This resulted in the passing of
G.O.(D) No. 177, dated 9.12.1995. The Government Order recorded the guarantee given by
the petitioner and the exclusive rights given to the petitioner were provided at paragraph 9 of
the G.O. and paragraph 10 of the G.O. contemplated signing of a Memorandum of
Understanding and the conditions were also specifically stipulated therein. The G.O. also
directed the petitioner to pay a sum of Rs.3.50 Lakhs to M/s. Times TV as a reimbursement
for the publicity measures already undertaken by them.
5.A Memorandum of Understanding was entered into on 9.12.1995 and it specifically
provided the terms and conditions and the rights given to the petitioner.
6.After the completion of the SAF games, the petitioner made a representation on
3.2.1996 to the Chairman and Managing Director of TAMIN and requested for remitting a
sum of Rs.1 Crore instead of Rs.3 Crores and to waive the balance of Rs.2 Crores. The
petitioner gave various reasons for making this request. According to the petitioner, he
incurred a loss of Rs.26.75 Lakhs and that he had spent a sum of Rs.2.25 Crores towards
advertisement charges and requested the Government to release the payment.
7.The Government issued G.O.Ms.No.324, dated 6.5.1996 and waived the sum of
Rs.2 Crores that was guaranteed by the petitioner subject to the condition that the petitioner
must pay the sum of Rs.3.50 Lakhs to M/s. Times TV and must withdraw the suit filed by him
for recovery of money. Accordingly, the petitioner paid the amount to M/s. times TV and also
withdrew C.S.No.95 of 1996 that was pending before this Court.
8.An FIR came to be registered by the Vigilance and Anti-Corruption Department on
27.8.1996. The petitioner was also added as A6 in this FIR. The complaint that led to the
registration of the FIR was that a favourable treatment was given to the petitioner inspite of
the Model Code of Conduct which was in force in view of the Assembly elections and inspite
of the serious objections raised by the Finance Department which resulted in the State
exchequer incurring a wrongful loss of a sum of Rs.2 Crores. The FIR was registered as
against six accused persons for offences under the Prevention of Corruption Act and IPC.
9.The petitioner started knocking the doors of the State Government and called upon
the Government to pay the expenses incurred by the petitioner towards advertisement
charges. The Government replied to the petitioner stating that the criminal case is pending
and it will not be possible to settle the claims made by the petitioner.
10.The petitioner was also blacklisted by the Government of Tamil Nadu through a
G.O. dated 3.4.1997. It is stated that W.P.No.5257 of 1997, was filed against this Order and
the Writ Petition was allowed by an Order dated 5.10.2002.
11.A communication dated 20.6.2000 was sent to the petitioner calling upon the
petitioner to show cause as to why G.O.Ms.No.324, dated 6.5.1996 should not be cancelled.
The petitioner challenged the same by filing W.P.No.11616 of 2000 and this Writ Petition was
dismissed by an Order dated 12.7.2000 and the petitioner was directed to submit his reply for
the show cause notice.
12.There was exchange of notices between the petitioner and the Government
wherein the petitioner was requesting for copies of documents relied upon by the
Government. Ultimately, the petitioner was allowed to inspect the documents and according
to the petitioner, the counsel was allowed to inspect only certain documents and the entire
materials were not shown to him. Thereafter, the petitioner once again filed W.P.No.14476 of
2000 questioning the letter dated 21.8.2000 issued by the Government, wherein the
Government informed the petitioner that no further extension of time will be granted for
giving the reply for the show cause notice and the petitioner also sought for the relevant
materials relied upon by the Government. The above Writ Petition came to be dismissed by
this Court by an Order dated 25.8.2000. The petitioner thereafter gave an additional reply
dated 27.8.2000 through his Counsel.
13.The Government considered the explanation given by the petitioner and
G.O.Ms.No.45,       dated 12.10.2000     was    issued   and   by     virtue of   the   same,
G.O.Ms.No.324, dated 6.5.1996 was cancelled. The petitioner filed W.P.No.17844 of 2000 and
challenged G.O.Ms.No.45, dated 12.10.2000. The Government also filed a detailed Counter in
this Writ Petition. The petitioner chose to withdraw this Writ Petition on the ground that he
intends to approach the Government to reconsider the G.O. and the Writ Petition, by an
Order dated 22.8.2002 was dismissed as withdrawn and it was made clear that if the
petitioner is aggrieved by any further decision of the Government, he was at liberty to
approach the Court.
14.The petitioner made a representation dated 2.12.2002 to the Government and
requested for the cancellation of G.O.Ms.No.45, releasing his payments incurred towards
advertisement charges and to drop the action in the criminal case.
15.A closure report was filed in the criminal case before the concerned Court and
further action was dropped and the concerned Court also passed an Order on 9.12.2004,
recording the same.
16.The Collector of Chennai issued a Notice dated 31.10.2006 and initiated
proceedings under the Revenue Recovery Act for the recovery of a sum of Rs.2 Crores from
the petitioner. The petitioner filed W.P.No.49785 and 49786 of 2006 and challenged
G.O.Ms.No.45 and also the communication dated 31.10.2006 sent by the Collector.
17.The petitioner chose to withdraw both the Writ Petitions on the ground that they
once again wanted to make a representation to the Government and this Court disposed of
the Writ Petitions as withdrawn and gave liberty to the petitioner if in any case, any adverse
order is passed against him. Immediately thereafter a representation was made by the
petitioner to the Government on 6.9.2011 and a further representation on 16.9.2011.
A detailed reminder dated 11.10.2011 was also sent to the Government.
18.The Government, on considering the representations made by the petitioner,
through a letter dated 2.6.2012, rejected the request made by the petitioner. The District
Collector also initiated proceedings under the Revenue Recovery Act, for the recovery of a
sum of Rs.2 Crores from the petitioner.
19.The petitioner has therefore filed three Writ Petitions. W.P.No.19342 of 2013, has
been filed challenging the proceedings of the District Collector dated 2.7.2013. W.P.No.19343
of 2013, has been filed challenging G.O.Ms.No.45, dated 12.10.2000. W.P.No.19344 of 2013,
has been filed challenging the letter dated 2.6.2012 issued by the Government rejecting the
representations made by the petitioner.
20.The 1st respondent has filed a common counter affidavit. All the claims made by the
petitioner has been refuted in the counter affidavit and the 1 st respondent has given their
justification for cancelling G.O.Ms.No.324 and for initiating Revenue Recovery proceedings
against the petitioner.
21.Heard Mr.G.Rajagopalan, learned Senior Counsel for the petitioner and Mr.U.Arun,
learned Additional Advocate General for the respondents.
22.This Court has carefully considered the submissions made on either side and the
23.The main issue that has to be focused by this Court is with respect to
G.O.Ms.No.45, dated 12.10.2000 through which the earlier G.O. in G.O.Ms.No.324, dated
6.5.1996 was cancelled and the waiver that was granted in favour of the petitioner was
withdrawn. The subject matter of challenge in W.P.No.19342 and 19344 of 2013 wherein the
proceedings of the Collector of Chennai dated 2.7.2013 and the communication of the
Government of Tamil Nadu, dated 2.6.2012, are consequential to G.O.Ms.No.45. Therefore, if
G.O.Ms.No.45 is interfered by this Court, the consequential proceedings will automatically
fall. On the other hand, if this Court does not interfere with G.O.Ms.No.45, the consequential
proceedings will stand.
24.The main ground of attack by the Learned Senior Counsel appearing on behalf of
• The Government Order was passed in violation of principles of natural justice.
• After the FAD report was filed in the criminal case, there is no ground to
sustain the impugned G.O.
• The materials relied upon by the Government was not disclosed to the
petitioner.
• The impugned G.O. suffers from lack of jurisdiction since the dispute between
the petitioner and the Government should have been decided by a different
body and the Government should not have decided its own case.
• The petitioner was made to act upon G.O.Ms.No.324 and hence,
G.O.Ms.No.45 is vitiated by principles of estoppel.
• The impugned G.O. is vitiated by mala fides.
25.This is a peculiar case where the petitioner used his proximity with the Government
which was in the helm of affairs and managed to get certain favours. The proximity of the
petitioner with the head of the Government is clearly admitted by the petitioner in the
affidavit filed in support of the Writ Petition. The conduct of the petitioner right through also
clearly indicates that he will use this Court by filing Writ Petitions whenever the political
climate is not in his favour and withdraw the same once it turns in his favour. The reason as
to why this Court predicated this Order with such an adverse statement, will be evident while
discussing the facts of the case hereunder.
26.The     Government took a decision to use the SAF games as a viable economic
proposition by commercialisation of the events involving private sector in this regard. This
decision was taken on 28.7.1994 and the SAF games were planned to be conducted between
18.12.1995 to 27.12.1995. A tender was floated in this regard on 31.5.1995 and M/s. Times
TV, was declared as the highest bidder and they started spending money on the
advertisements. It is at this point of time, the petitioner got into the scene and he quoted an
amount of Rs.2 Crores. Immediately, a discussion was held with the petitioner and he seems
to have increased the offer to Rs.3 Crores. A G.O. was passed on 9.12.1995 in favour of the
petitioner and a Memorandum of Understanding was also entered into with the petitioner.
The G.O. as well as the Memorandum of Understanding contains various terms and
conditions. After the SAF games ended, the petitioner made a request on 3.2.1996 seeking
for the waiver of a sum of Rs.2 Crores and the petitioner came forward to remit only a sum
of Rs.1 Crore. On 15.4.1996, the petitioner submitted a breakup of the expenditure and
receipts. In this letter, there were absolutely no details or bills attached to substantiate the
claim made for the expenditure incurred by the petitioner. By the time this letter was issued,
the Model Code of Conduct was brought into force by the Election Commission on 10.3.1996
since the Assembly elections were slated to be held on 2.5.1996. It is quite surprising that
even during this period, the request made by the petitioner was very actively considered and
G.O.Ms.No.324, dated 6.5.1996 was issued by granting waiver to the petitioner to the tune of
27.The results of the Assembly elections was declared on 9.5.1996 and the party in
power lost the said election. The party which came to power found that the entire transaction
was done against the interest of the State and consequently, there was a loss for the State
exchequer. It was also found that the G.O. was issued inspite of the objections raised by the
Finance department. It was further found that the G.O. was issued hurriedly just before the
declaration of the election results and when the Model Code of Conduct was in force. Hence,
the Vigilance and Anti-Corruption Wing registered an FIR against six accused persons and the
petitioner was made as A6. The investigation was going on in this criminal case.
28.The Government took a decision to reconsider G.O.Ms.No.324 and hence issued a
show cause notice dated 20.6.2000 to the petitioner calling upon the petitioner to show
cause as to why the said G.O. should not be cancelled. The attempt made by the petitioner
to challenge the steps taken by the Government to cancel the G.O. in W.P. 11616 of 2000
and W.P.14476 of 2000 failed and this Court directed the petitioner to submit his reply for the
show cause notice. Accordingly, the petitioner also gave his reply.
29.The Government, on considering the reply given by the petitioner and various other
facts and circumstances, issued G.O.Ms.No.45, dated 12.10.2000 cancelling G.O.Ms No.324,
dated 6.5.1996. This Court carefully went through the entire G.O. and found that sufficient
reasons have been assigned to justify the cancellation of G.O.Ms.No.324. Every ground that
was raised by the petitioner was considered and rejected and the same is evident from
paragraph 21 of the said G.O. The Government came to a categoric conclusion that it was the
petitioner who volunteered and agreed to give a minimum guarantee amount of Rs.3 Crores
to the Government and there was no compulsion for the petitioner if he had felt that it will
not be possible for him to earn such an income. The Government also came to a conclusion
that G.O.Ms. No. 324 was issued by flouting the Tamil Nadu Government Business Rules and
undue favouritism was shown in favour of the petitioner.
30.The petitioner chose to challenge G.O.Ms.No.45 by filing W.P.17844 of 2000. A
detailed counter affidavit was also filed by the Government justifying the issuance of the G.O.
If the petitioner was really serious and aggrieved by the issuance of G.O.Ms.No.45, he should
have contested this Writ Petition on merits. However, the petitioner found that there was a
subsequent change in the political climate and the party which favoured him took over the
reins. The petitioner obviously wanted to take advantage of the changed scenario and he
consciously took a decision to withdraw the Writ Petition and accordingly, the Writ Petition
was dismissed as withdrawn through an Order dated 22.8.2002. Immediately thereafter, the
petitioner makes a representation dated 2.12.2002 to the Government and it will be
interesting to take note of the request that was made by the petitioner which is extracted
“9) Hence I request the Government.
(g) To Cancell G.O.MS No.45 youth Welfare and Sports Development
Department dated 12.10.2000 and restore G.O. M.S no.324 dated 6.5.96.
(h) Release Payment of newspapers to us, so that we can inturn
release payment to the newspapers.
(i) Forthwith drop further action in crime no.8/96 DVAC Hq.”
31.The representation made by the petitioner was acted upon and as a first step, a
closure report was filed before the Criminal Court and an Order was passed on 9.12.2004,
closing the FIR as “further action dropped”.
32.The petitioner also started pushing for the payments made by him for
advertisement and hence called upon the Government to release the payments as per
G.O.Ms.No.324. At this point of time, there was once again a change in Government after the
next elections. Since G.O.M.S.No.45 was in force, the Collector of Chennai called upon the
petitioner to settle the sum of Rs.2 Crores, failing which, proceedings would be initiated
33.The petitioner decided to once again challenge G.O.M.S.No.45 and also the letter of
the Collector informing the petitioner that proceedings will be initiated under the Revenue
Recovery Act and hence, filed W.P.Nos.49785 and 49786 of 2006. Some interim orders were
passed in these Writ Petitions and these Writ Petitions were pending.
34.Once again there was a change in the political climate in the year 2011.        The
petitioner obviously decided to make use of the same and once again chose to withdraw both
the Writ Petitions and the Writ Petitions were dismissed as withdrawn by an Order dated
30.8.2011. The petitioner also got a liberty to work out his remedy with the State
Government. For the first time, the then Government was not prepared to accede to the
request made by the petitioner for withdrawing G.O.Ms.No.45 and for making the payments
claimed by the petitioner. Hence, the representations made by the petitioner were rejected
through a communication dated 2.6.2012 and once again revenue recovery proceedings were
initiated by the Collector for recovery of a sum of Rs.2 Crores from the petitioner. Once again
the petitioner knocked the doors of this Court and filed the above three Writ Petitions. It is
clear from the conduct of the petitioner that he will resort to legal proceedings depending
upon the Government that was in the helm of affairs. By doing so, the petitioner has
challenged G.O.Ms.No.45 for the third time and the revenue recovery proceedings for the
second time before this Court.
35.The ground raised by the learned Senior Counsel for the petitioner as if, the
impugned G.O. was issued in violation of principles of natural justice, is clearly unsustainable.
The petitioner was put on notice and he gave detailed reply and every ground was
considered and only thereafter, G.O.Ms.No.45 came to be issued. Merely because further
action was dropped in the criminal case, that by itself is not a ground for withdrawing
G.O.Ms.No.45 and the reasons for issuing this G.O. has been elaborately discussed in the
36.Insofar as the ground of lack of jurisdiction is concerned, it is always left open to a
Government to correct its mistakes when a palpable illegality is brought to its notice. The
circumstances under which G.O.Ms.No.324 was issued, is quite curious. This G.O. was issued
with a tearing hurry just before the election results were announced and the powers that be
went that extra mile to favour the petitioner and caused a loss of Rs.2 Crores to the State
exchequer. The petitioner was bound by G.O.(D)No.177 and Memorandum of Understanding
and the terms and conditions contained therein and for a commercial venture of this nature,
it is too unnatural for a Government to waive the amount undertaken by the petitioner. That
is the reason why this Court commented that undue favour was shown to the petitioner
utilising his proximity to the then head of the Government. In view of the same, this Court
holds that it was perfectly within the power and jurisdiction of the Government to issue
37.There is no question of applying the principles of estoppel in this case since
G.O.Ms.No.324 was a favour that was done to the petitioner for obvious reasons and the
principle of estoppel is not meant to be applied in cases of this nature.
38.The ground of mala fides raised by the Petitioner also does not pass muster. This
Court has already found that there were sufficient grounds to cancel G.O.Ms.No.324 through
G.O.Ms.No.45 and this was done after affording opportunity to the petitioner and after
providing sufficient reasons for the cancellation of the earlier G.O. If any person chooses to
conduct his business with an apparent political identity, it has its own consequences. With
such a political identity, a routine ground that is always raised is mala fides when action is
initiated by the subsequent Government. Mala fides is a ground which has to be pleaded and
proved and it is not a matter of assumption. The petitioner has not made out a case for mala
fides and G.O.Ms.No.45 gives solid reasons as to why the earlier G.O. was cancelled and it
has to be sustained on its own merits.
39.The learned Additional Advocate General questioned the maintainability of these
Writ Petitions on the ground that the petitioner had withdrawn the earlier Writ Petitions and
hence, the present Writ Petitions are hit by the principles of res judicata. In the considered
view of this Court, the petitioner managed to get some liberty from this Court and hence this
Court did not want to reject the Writ Petitions on the ground of res judicata and hence,
discussed the merits of the case. However, the manner in which the petitioner was filing one
Writ Petition after another and withdrawing it on his own whims and fancies, is a conduct
which strongly goes against the petitioner.
40.In view of the above discussion, this Court does not find any merits in the claim
made by the petitioner and there are absolutely no grounds to interfere with G.O.Ms.No.45
dated 12.10.2000. Accordingly, W.P.No.19343 of 2013 is liable to be dismissed.
41.Insofar as W.P.Nos.19342 and 19344 are concerned, the impugned proceedings
under challenge are consequential to G.O.Ms.No.45. Since this Court upholds G.O.Ms.No.45,
the consequential proceedings will also stand and as a result, these two Writ Petitions are
also liable to be dismissed.
42.The learned Senior Counsel appearing on behalf of the petitioner was continuously
harping on the advertisement charges not being paid by the Government. The petitioner
ought to have prosecuted and sought for the recovery of the amount in the Civil Suit. The
petitioner took a calculated risk and withdrew the Civil Suit and hence he has to blame only
himself for the situation in which he is placed. A litigant must understand that Court
proceedings are to be taken seriously and the rights have to be agitated sincerely before a
Court. The Court will come to the aid of only such litigants. Insofar as the petitioner is
concerned, he was coming to this Court as if it was an amusement park and he got in and
got out as per his own whims and fancies. The petitioner has to necessarily face the
consequences for such a conduct.
43.In the result, all the Writ Petitions stand dismissed and the petitioner is directed to
pay a cost of Rs.1,00,000/- (Rupees One Lakh only) to the Chief Justice Relief Fund
within a period of four weeks from the date of receipt of copy of this Order.   No costs.
Consequently, connected miscellaneous petitions are closed.
