Petitioners are before this Court calling in question
proceedings in C.C.No.115 of 2021 pending before the Principal
Civil Judge & JMFC, Channapatna, arising out of PCR No.151 of
2018, initiated for offences punishable under Sections 494 and
109 of IPC r/w. Section 34 of the IPC.
2. Heard Sri Ravindranath K., learned counsel for the
petitioners and Sri S.G.Rajendra Reddy, learned counsel for the
3. Brief facts leading to the filing of the present petition, as
borne out from the pleadings, are as follows:-
Petitioner No.1 presently aged 76 years is the husband of
the   complainant/wife/respondent        who    is  aged  69    years.
Petitioner Nos.2 to 6 are all either family members, close
relatives or friends of the 1st petitioner/husband. Marriage
between the 1st petitioner and the respondent takes place on
02.05.1968.     It is stated that from the wedlock of the 1st
petitioner and the respondent three children were born. Out of
the three, one is no more and two others who are daughters are
residing in their respective matrimonial houses.         It is the
averment in the petition that in the year 1972-73, the 1st
petitioner with the consent of the respondent married one Smt.
Savitramma who is the sister of the respondent/complainant.
From that wedlock, the 1st petitioner and Smt. Savitramma have
two children – one is 45 years old and the other is 43 years old.
4. The 1st petitioner again gets married in the year 1993
with the 2nd petitioner/Smt. Varalakshmi. Again the averment is
that, it was with the permission and consent of the 1st and 2nd
wives. It is also stated that the properties of the 1st petitioner
were equally divided amongst all of them.     Therefore, it is the
contention that the 1st wife - Smt. Chandramma/respondent
was aware of the marriage of the 1st petitioner with Smt.
Savitramma, the second marriage and both Smt. Savitramma
and the respondent were aware of the marriage of the 1st
petitioner with the 2nd petitioner i.e., the third marriage. It is
also stated that all of them lived together peacefully.
5. In the year 2008, it appears that the 1st petitioner
constructed a residential house in which the 1st and the 2nd
petitioners performed all the rituals in the presence of all the
members of the family and the wives.         On 12-01-2015, it is
averred that a gift deed was registered by the 1st petitioner in
favour of the 2nd petitioner of a particular property.   Likewise,
another property was also gifted to the 2nd petitioner. The gifts
made by the 1st petitioner in favour of the 2nd petitioner did not
go well with the respondent/wife referred to as the first wife. On
07-07-2017, the respondent causes a legal notice upon the 1st
and 2nd petitioners contending that the 1st and the 2nd
petitioners have got married on suppression of earlier marriage
that took place between the respondent and the 1st petitioner.
The 1st and the 2nd petitioners also replied to the notice.
Another civil proceeding is instituted by the daughters of the 1st
petitioner and the respondent in O.S.No.91 of 2017 claiming
partition   and   separate   possession   of  various  properties
belonging to the 1st petitioner.      Both the 1st and the 2nd
petitioners are defendants in the said suit.
6. Things standing thus, the respondent files a private
complaint invoking Section 200 of the Cr.P.C. against the
petitioners herein alleging offences punishable under Section
494 of the IPC for bigamy, Section 109 of the IPC for abatement
and Section 34 of the IPC in PCR No.151 of 2018.              The
respondent also files an application under Section 12 of the
Domestic Violence Act, 2015 on the very next day of registration
of the aforesaid private complaint in Criminal Miscellaneous
No.138 of 2018.     The other petitioners appear to have given
evidence in Criminal Miscellaneous No.138 of 2018. Later, the
learned Magistrate in P.C.R.No.151 of 2018 issued summons to
the petitioners on 08-02-2021 after registering the crime in
C.C.No.115 of 2021 in terms of Section 204 of the Cr.P.C., which
was after an order taking cognizance of the offences against the
petitioners. It is this act of the learned Magistrate taking
cognizance that is called in question in the subject petition.
7. The learned counsel appearing for the petitioners would
vehemently argue and contend that the allegation of polygamy
against    the    1st     petitioner   is   unfounded       as   the
complainant/respondent         was   very   well   aware     of  the
relationships of the 1st petitioner as with her consent the 1st
petitioner   married     one   Smt.  Savitramma,     sister   of the
complainant and with the consent of both the sisters married
the 2nd petitioner. It is his submission that all these events have
happened first in the year 1972-73 and later, in the year 1993-
94. The complaint is registered in the year 2018, after about 25
years of the marriage with the 2nd petitioner and after about 45
years of the complainant being aware of the 2nd marriage. In all,
the submission of the learned counsel is that, the dispute with
regard to distribution of properties is racked up by registering a
private complaint 25 years after the marriage of the 2nd
8. On other hand, the learned counsel appearing for the
respondent would vehemently refute the submissions to contend
that the complainant was not even aware of the marriage of the
1st petitioner with the 2nd petitioner. Suppressing the fact that
the 1st petitioner is already married, he married the 2nd
petitioner which would definitely amount to bigamy and there
can be no delay in cases of bigamy is his emphatic submission.
9.   I  have  given   my   anxious    consideration   to the
submissions made by the respective learned counsel appearing
for the parties and perused the material on record.
10. The afore-narrated graphic details of dates and events
are not disputed and are therefore not reiterated.         The 3rd
marriage of the 1st petitioner is admitted even in the petition.
Therefore, the only issue that false for my consideration is,
“Whether the offence of bigamy is a continuing
offence or the proceedings instituted for offence punishable
for bigamy under Section 494 of the Cr.P.C. can be
obliterated on the ground of delay?
11. A few dates that would be needed for the said
consideration are that, the marriage of the 1st petitioner with the
complainant is on 02-05-1968. Marriage with the sister of the
complainant is in the year 1972-73. From the wedlock, the 1st
petitioner with the complainant or her sister has three and two
children respectively, who are all aged more than 45 years.
During the subsistence of these two marriages, the 1st petitioner
marries the 2nd petitioner on 12-04-1993. Therefore, the 1st
petitioner has admitted that he has contracted three marriages.
The complainant being aware of subsequent marriages are not
would be legally immaterial.    The Apex Court in the case of
STATE OF BIHAR v. DEOKARAN NENSHI AND ANOTHER1,
has interpreted the phrase ‘continuing offence’ and holds as
“5. A continuing offence is one which is susceptible of
continuance and is distinguishable from the one which is
committed once and for all. It is one of those offences which
arise out of a failure to obey or comply with a rule or its
requirement and which involves a penalty, the liability for
which continues until the rule or its requirement is obeyed or
complied with. On every occasion that such disobedience or
non-compliance occurs and reoccurs, there is the offence
committed.      The distinction between the two kinds of
offences is between an act or omission which constitutes an
offence once and for all and an act or omission which
continues, and therefore, constitutes a fresh offence every
time or occasion on which it continues. In the case of a
continuing offence, there is thus the ingredient of
continuance of the offence which is absent in the case of an
offence which takes place when an act or omission is
committed once and for all.”
The Apex Court holds that a continuing offence is one which is
susceptible of continuance and is distinguishable from the one
which is committed once and for all.            Following the aforesaid
judgment, a learned single Judge of the High Court of Gujarat in
the case of JAFAR ABBAS RASOOLMOHAMMAD MERCHANT v.
STATE OF GUJARAT2, holds that bigamy is a continuing
offence. The learned Judge has held as follows:
“56. In interpreting Section 494 of the IPC, one
should look into the purpose of enactment and also to the
mischief to be prevented. The object of enacting Section
494 of the Penal Code, 1860, to my mind, clearly was to
punish persons, who in defiance of the law applicable to
them in matters of marriage and divorce, etc., take a
second wife during the existence of the first, but for the
Personal Law of the Muslim, as discussed above, the
applicant would be guilty of the offence of bigamy, if
ultimately proved, on the basis of the evidence recorded in
the course of the trial. He is able to get away with which
by misinterpreting and misusing to his advantage, the
message of the holy prophet Mohmmad, which is reflected
in the holy ‘Quran’. The ‘Quran’ does not say that a
Muslim can treat his wife cruelly, drive her out and without
dissolution the first marriage in accordance with law, he
can marry for the second time and upto four times. The
message of the holy prophet is loud and clear. Everyone
knows about it, but still do not want to follow it.
77. In the case of State of Bihar v. Deokaran Nenshi,
reported in (1972) 2 SCC 890: (AIR 1973 SC 908), it was
observed by the Apex Court that a continuing offence is one
which is susceptible of continuance and is distinguished
from the one which is committed once and for all. It is one
of those offences which arise out of a failure to obey or
comply with a rule or its requirement and which involves a
penalty, the liability for which continues until the rule or its
requirement is obeyed or complied with. On every occasion
that such disobedience or non-compliance occurs and
reoccurs, there is the offence committed. The distinction
between the two kinds of offences is between an act or
omission which constitutes an offence once and for all and
an act or omission which continues, and therefore,
constitutes a fresh offence every time or occasion on which
it continues. In the case of a continuing offence, there is
thus the ingredient of continuance of the offence which is
absent in the case of an offence which takes place when
an act or omission is committed once and for all.”
Several other High Courts have also taken the similar view that
bigamy is a continuing offence. If admitted facts as deliberated
hereinabove are taken note of, it cannot be in doubt that the 1st
petitioner has contracted second and even third marriages
during the subsistence of the 1st marriage with the complainant.
In the teeth of the admitted fact, no further interpretation need
be given, as even to day, the 1st petitioner admits that he is the
husband of three women.      Therefore, he is in the web of the
offence   punishable   under   Section   494   of  the  IPC.  The
proceedings against the 1st and 2nd petitioners cannot be
quashed as the offence is admitted by the 1st petitioner in the
petition. It being with the consent of the 1st wife or with the
consent of the 1st and 2nd wives for the third time would become
immaterial for consideration of offence of bigamy. In the teeth of
the admitted facts of the petitioner marrying thrice and its
subsistence even as on day, the plea of delay in registration of
the crime would pale into insignificance, as bigamy in the case
at hand is a continuing offence.       The 1st petitioner, the 2nd
petitioner and the other two wives of the 1st petitioner have all
married the 1st petitioner during the subsistence of each others
marriage and being fully aware of the preceding marriage.
Therefore, the proceedings will have to be continued against
12. Insofar as the case of petitioner Nos.3, 4, 5 and 6 is
concerned, it will have to be viewed with a different lens. The act
of bigamy generally is a triangle involving the husband, the 1st
wife and the 2nd wife. This is a peculiar case where it is a
quadrangle, though the 2nd wife is not before the Court.
Therefore, the 1st petitioner, 2nd petitioner and the complainant
will have to resolve the issue amongst themselves. Petitioner
Nos.3, 4, 5, and 6 who are other family members or friends of
the 1st petitioner cannot be hauled into these proceedings unless
there are instances to demonstrate that they were responsible
for the commission of second marriage or even the third
marriage. That is not the averment in the complaint.        The 2nd
marriage has taken place in the year 1973 and the third
marriage in the year 1993. Dragging all other members of the
family and friends into the web of these proceedings sans
13. Therefore, criminal proceedings against petitioner
Nos.3, 4, 5 and 6 require to be obliterated and the charge sheet
against petitioner Nos.1 and 2 is required to be sustained only
for the offence under Section 494 of the IPC and not under
Section 109 of IPC.
14. It is for the protagonists in the quadrangle to resolve
the issue amongst themselves and not drag other persons into
these proceedings. If the proceedings against other petitioners
are not quashed, it would become an abuse of the process of
law, result in miscarriage of justice and quadruplet harassment
to petitioner Nos.3 to 6.
15. For the aforesaid reasons, I pass the following:
i.    The Criminal Petition is allowed in part.
ii.   Criminal Petition insofar as it concerns petitioner
Nos.1 and 2 stands dismissed.
iii. Criminal petition insofar as petitioner Nos.3, 4, 5 and
6 is concerned is allowed. Proceedings against them
stand quashed.
iv.  It is made clear that the observations made in the
course of this order are only for the purpose of
consideration of the case of the petitioners either to
sustain or to obliterate the proceedings. The same
would not influence or bind further proceedings
against petitioner Nos.1 and 2 or any other accused
or   any  other   proceedings    pending   before    the
authorities.
