This is an appeal filed under Section 374(2) of the Code of
Criminal Procedure by accused Nos.1 and 2 in S.C.No.1317/2003
on the file of the IInd Additional Sessions Court, Kollam, assailing
conviction and sentence imposed against them as per judgment
dated 12.03.2007.          State of Kerala represented by the Public
Prosecutor is the respondent.
2.      Heard the learned counsel for the appellants as well as
the learned Public Prosecutor in detail.
It is alleged by the prosecution that the 1 st accused had
married one Suja, the cousin sister of the defacto complainant, in
accordance with the religious rites and customs prevalent in their
community, on 6.2.1999. At the time of marriage, 35 sovereigns of
gold ornaments had been given to Suja and a sum of Rs.2,50,000/-
was promised to be paid as dowry within 2 years from the date of
marriage. Subsequent to the marriage, the above Suja as well as
the 1st accused were lived together as husband and wife in
Village, which is the family house of the 1st accused as well as the
2nd accused, who is the mother of the 1st accused. It is alleged
further that during the stay, the accused had subjected Suja to
cruelty and harassed her demanding the promised dowry which had
not been paid even after one year of the marriage. The 1 st accused
had demanded Suja to go to her house and bring dowry and the 2 nd
accused had asked her to commit suicide if she could not pay
dowry.       So the consistent nagging and demand for dowry had
driven Suja to suicide, some time between 9.30 p.m on 13.03.2000
and 4 o' clock in the morning on the next day, by hanging on a fan
hook at the bed room of the residential house of the accused,
Balakrishnavilasom veedu bearig Door No.250 of Ward No.II of
Ummannoor Panchayat.            Thus the accused alleged to have
committed the offences punishable under Sections 304(B), 306 r/w
34 of I.P.C.
4.      On the above facts, Kottarakkara police registered crime
No.186/2000 and on investigation charge was laid against the
accused under Section 304(B), 306 r/w 34 of I.P.C.
5.      The case was committed to the Sessions Court, Kollam
and in turn made over to the IInd Additional Sessions Court, Kollam
and the said Court tried the case after framing charge.
6.      During trial, the prosecution adduced evidence by
examining PWs 1 to 11 and marked Exts.P1 to P15. During cross
examination of the prosecution witnesses, Exts.D1 and D2
contradictions were marked on the side of the defence.
7.      Though after questioning the accused under Section 313
of Cr.P.C, opportunity was given to adduce evidence, no defence
evidence adduced.
8.      On analysing the evidence after hearing both sides, the
trial court found that accused 1 and 2 committed offences under
Section 304(B) and 306 r/w 34 of I.P.C and accordingly they were
sentenced to undergo R.I for a period of 7 years for the offence
under Section 304(B) r/w 34 of I.P.C and to undergo R.I for a
period of 3 years under Section 306 r/w 34 of I.P.C.
9.      It is argued by the learned counsel for the appellants that
the trial court convicted the appellants without support of sufficient
evidence and remote evidence given by PW2 and PW3 was given
emphasis to find the commission of the above offences by the
appellants. He also pointed out that Ext.P4 diary, alleged to be
written by the deceased when forwarded to FSL, Ext.P12 report
was given by the expert suggesting that there is probability to write
the diary by the deceased.
10. Repelling this argument, the learned Public Prosecutor
vehemently supported the conviction and sentence and he pressed
for upholding the conviction and sentence, since the prosecution
successfully established commission of offences under Section
304B and 306 of I.P.C.
11.     In view of the rival arguments, it is necessary in the
interest of justice to appreciate the evidence in this case.
12. PW1 examined in this case is the cousin brother of Suja.
He deposed about the marriage between the 1st accused and Suja
held on 06.02.1999 at Anupama Auditorium, Chadayamangalam
and the joint residence of the 1st accused and Suja at the
matrimonial home in Odanavattom. His evidence further is that on
14.03.2000 morning Suja died and there were problems in the
marital life. 1st and 2nd accused created problems demanding more
dowry and the 1st accused used to make scenes demanding dowry
under the influence of alcohol. His evidence further is that Suja
committed suicide due to cruelty, demanding more dowry. Ext.P1
marked through PW1 is the F.I statement. PW1 given evidence
further that at the time of marriage 35 sovereigns of gold ornaments
were given to Suja and it was agreed to give Rs.2.5 lakh more
within 2 years as dowry. He deposed further that his statement in
Ext.P1 to the effect that Suja would not commit suicide on the
ground of dowry for the reason that there was 2 years' time for
paying the same is not correct and this portion of his previous
statement was marked as Ext.D1 on the side of the defence.
13. PW2 examined in this case is the mother of Suja. She
deposed before the court that Suja is her daughter and the accused
are the husband and mother in law of Suja. She also deposed about
the marriage between the 1st accused and Suja held on 06.02.1999
and their joint residence at the matrimonial home thereafter.
According to PW2, the marital life of Suja and the 1 st accused was
not satisfactory and the 1st accused used to create problems
demanding dowry after consuming alcohol. According to PW2, at
the time of marriage, 35 sovereigns of gold ornaments were given
and it was agreed to give Rs.2.5 lakh more within 2 years. But the
accused demanded the said amount before 2 years. Though her
daughter demanded the same, money was not given. She deposed
about the cruelty on the part of the accused which led to suicide of
Suja. She deposed about abortion of Suja after 2 to 3 months of the
marriage. She deposed further that gold chain with thali, one ring,
a pair of earrings and an anklet were the items available at the time
of death and the other items of gold ornaments were in the custody
of the accused. When PW2 was confronted about the handwriting
in Ext.P4, a diary alleged to be written by Suja before suicide, she
emphatically denied the same as the hand writing of Suja. Her
evidence further is that the 1st accused maintained relationship with
another lady, by name Elisa, even before the marriage. During
cross examination, PW2 admitted that the 1 st accused and Suja used
to visit her house and they used to stay there for 2 days and PW2
also used to visit the matrimonial home occassionally.          PW3
examined in this case is the younger sister of Suja.        She also
deposed supporting the evidence of PW2 in the matter of marriage
and its aftermath. According to her, a few days after the marriage,
Suja informed her that there was cruelty on the part of the accused
demanding dowry. She also deposed that the 1 st accused was of
drinking habit and he used to manhandle Suja after consuming
alcohol. PW3 given evidence further that Suja committed suicide
due to harassment of the accused demanding dowry. Further when
Suja became pregnant, the 1st accused pulled her down from the cot
and thereby she had abortion.       Suja was hospitalised in this
connection in Kottarakkara. PW3 also given evidence stating that
the husband of PW2 and her father died 17 years prior to the date
of occurrence and the 2 daughters including Suja were looked after
by PW2 by utilising her income as a Peon in Public Works
Department. She also given evidence that PW2 given education to
the daughters and both daughters are graduates. While admitting
the signature of Suja in Ext.P2 series letters, PW3 denied the
handwriting in Ext.P4 diary.    She also given evidence supporting
the evidence of PW2 to the effect that the 1 st accused maintained
relationship with another lady by name Elisa and the relationship
was in existence even prior to the marriage of the 1st accused and
14. PW4 examined in this case is the Grama Panchayat
President, Ummannoor. According to him, the accused were his
neighbours and he had put signature in Ext.P3 inquest report
prepared after the death of Suja. He also given evidence that the
autopsy examination of Suja was at MCH, Thiruvananthapuram
and the body was brought to the house of the 1 st accused and later
burried in Chadayamangalam, the house of Suja. He also given
evidence that he participated in the funeral where he could not find
the 1st accused and the other accused.
15. PW5 examined in this case is none other than the
husband of the sister of the 1st accused and the daughter of the 2nd
accused. He had given evidence denying production of Ext.P4
diary alleged to be written by Suja before death. According to
PW5, Ext.P4 diary was taken by the police from the place of
occurrence on the date of occurrence itself. The prosecution case is
that it was PW5, who produced Ext.P4 before the police after a
week from the date of occurrence. In fact, PW5 turned hostile to
the prosecution.       PW6 examined in this case was the police
constable at Thenmala police station as on 15.09.2000 and he had
given evidence that he had put signature in Ext.P5 mahazar
prepared for taking custody of Ext.P4 diary when it was produced
by PW5. He also admitted during cross examination that Ext.P5
mahazar is in his own handwriting.
16. PW8 in this case prepared Ext.P3 inquest report while
working as Tahsildar and Executive Magistrate at Kottarakkara
during March, 2000.       PW9 examined in this case is Dr.Rema,
Assistant       Professor and Deputy     Police   Surgeon,   MCH,
Thiruvananthapuram during March, 2000 and she had given
evidence supporting Ext.P7 postmortem certificate. As per Ext.P7
and as per evidence of PW9, opinion as to cause of death is stated
as “postmortem appearances are consistent with death due to
hanging”. PW10, the then A.S.I of Police Kottarakkara, deposed
about the recording of Ext.P1 statement of PW1 and registration of
crime No.156/2000 under Section 174 Cr.P.C                          and Ext.P1(a)
marked through him is copy of FIR.                     He had arrested the 1 st
accused on 2.6.2000. Ext.D1 contradiction stands proved through
PW10. PW11 is the Investigating Officer. He generally supported
the investigation. It seems that the learned Sessions Judge given
much emphasis to the evidence of PW2 and PW3 to find that the
accused herein committed offences under Section 304B, 306 r/w 34
17. Before addressing the question as to whether the
findings entered into by the trial court is justifiable, it is worthwhile
to discuss the essentials required to constitute offences under
Section 304B as well as 306 of I.P.C. Section 304 of I.P.C deals
with dowry death. Section 304B of I.P.C is extracted hereunder:
“304B. Dowry death. -- (1) Where the death of a woman is
caused by any burns or bodily injury or occurs otherwise than under
normal circumstances within seven years of her marriage and it is
shown that soon before her death she was subjected to cruelty or
harassment by her husband or any relative of her husband for, or in
connection with, any demand for dowry, such death shall be called
"dowry death", and such husband or relative shall be deemed to have
caused her death.
Explanation.For the purposes of this sub-section, "dowry" shall
have the same meaning as in section 2 of the Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961
(28 of 1961).
(2) Whoever commits dowry death shall be punished with
imprisonment for a term which shall not be less than seven years but
which may extend to imprisonment for life."
18. Thus the ingredients to constitute an offence under
(a)     There was an unnatural death of a woman;
(b)     that woman had been married within 7 years preceding
her aforesaid unnatural death,                    and
(c)     soon before her death she was subjected to cruelty or
(i)     such cruelty or harassment had been caused to her by
her husband or husband's other relative;
(ii) that such cruelty or harassment was for or in connection
with any demand for dowry.
In all dowry death cases the standard of appreciation of evidence
has to be in the light of the provisions contained in Section 113A of
19. It is relevant to note that when an offence under Section
304B of I.P.C is alleged, the same has a proximate nexus with
Section 113B of the Evidence Act, 1872 which reads as follows:
“Section 113B: Presumption as to dowry death;-- When the
question is whether a person has committed the dowry death of a woman
and it is shown that soon before her death such woman had been subjected
by such person to cruelty or harassment for, or in connection with, any
demand for dowry, the Court shall presume that such person had caused
the dowry death.
Explanation:-- For the purposes of this section, “dowry death”
shall have the same meaning as in section 304B of the Indian Penal Code
(45 of 1860).”
20. Section 113B of the Evidence Act in the later part
mandates drawing of presumptions that the husband or relative of
the husband of the victim girl have caused her death and this
presumption of dowry death corresponds to presumption as to
dowry death envisaged in Section 113B of the Evidence Act, 1872.
Section 304B(1) of the I.P.C, 1860 has 2 limbs. First limb defines
dowry death and the second limb deals with the legal consequence
of occurrence of dowry death namely, that the husband or such
other relative of the husband who soon before the death of the lady
was found to have subjected the lady to cruelty or harassment shall
conclusively be held to be guilty of the offence of dowry death. In
the decision reported in [2015 (8) Scale 270 : AIR 2015 SC 3043 :
2015 Crl.J 4021 (SC)], V.K.Mishra v. State of Uttarakhand, a 3
Judge Bench of the Apex Court while dealing with Section 304B of
IPC and 113B of the Evidence Act, inter alia, held, after referring
another decision reported in [AIR 2015 SC 980], Shersing alias
Partapa v. State of Haryana that the word `shown' instead of
`proved' in Section 304B of I.P.C indicates that the onous cast on
the prosecution would stand satisfied on the anvil of a mere
preponderance of probability. In other words, `shown' would have
to be read upon to mean `proved', but only to the extent of
preponderance of probability. It was held further that in a case of
demand for dowry, independent and direct evidence with regard to
the occurrence is ordinarily not available.                        That is why the
legislature had introduced Section 113A and 113B in the Evidence
Act by permitting presumptions to be raised in certain
21. In another decision of the Apex Court reported in [AIR
2016 SC 5313 : 2016 KHC 6768] Baijnath & Ors. v. State of
Madhya Pradesh, the Apex Court considered the legislative
mandate to invoke the presumption under Section 113B of the
Evidence Act and held as under:
“33.    A conjoint reading of these three provisions, thus predicate
the burden of the prosecution to unassailably substantiate the ingredients of
the two offences by direct and convincing evidence so as to avail the
presumption engrafted in S.113B of the Act against the accused. Proof of
cruelty or harassment by the husband or her relative or the person charged
is thus the sine qua non to inspirit the statutory presumption, to draw the
person charged within the coils thereof.         If the prosecution fails to
demonstrate by cogent coherent and persuasive evidence to prove such
fact, the person accused of either of the above referred offences cannot be
held guilty by taking refuge only of the presumption to cover up the
shortfall in proof.
34.     The legislative premature of relieving the prosecution of the
rigour of the proof of the often practically inaccessible recesses of life
within the guarded confines of a matrimonial home and of replenishing the
consequential void, by according a presumption against the person
charged, cannot be overeased to gloss – over and condone its failure to
prove credibly, the basic facts enumerated in the Sections involved, lest
justice is the casualty.
35.     This Court while often dwelling on the scope and purport of
S.304B of the Code and S.113B of the Act have propounded that the
presumption is contingent on the fact that the prosecution first spell out the
ingredients of the offence of S.304B as in Shindo Alias Sawinder Kaur and
another Vs. State of Punjab – 2011 (11) SCC 517 and echoed in Rajeev
Kumar Vs. State of Haryana – 2013 (16) SCC 640.                In the latter
pronouncement, this Court propounded that one of the essential ingredients
of dowry death under S.304B of the Code is that the accused must have
subjected the woman to cruelty in connection with demand for dowry soon
before her death and that this ingredient has to be proved by the
prosecution beyond reasonable doubt and only then the Court will presume
that the accused has committed the offence of dowry death under S.113B of
the Act. It referred to with approval, the earlier decision of this Court in
K.Prema S.Rao v. Yadla Srinivasa Rao – 2003 (1) SCC 217 to the effect
that to attract the provision of S.304B of the Code, one of the main
ingredients of the offence which is required to be established is that “soon
before her death” she was subjected to cruelty and harassment “in
connection with the demand for dowry”.
22. Similarly, in another decision reported in [AIR 2014 SC
227 : 2013 (13) Scale 410], Rajeev Kumar v. State of Haryana, the
Hon'ble Supreme Court referred another decision reported in [AIR
2003 SC 11], K.Prema S.Rao & anr. v. Yadla Srinivasa Rao &
ors. and held as under:
“One of the main ingredients of the offence of dowry death under
section 304-B of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 which is required to be
established is that “soon before the death” the accused must have subjected
a woman to cruelty in connection with demand of dowry.”
23. In the decision reported in [2015 SC 1359], Rajinder
Singh v. State of Punjab, the Apex Court held that “soon before”
in Section 304B, is not synonymous with “immediately before”.
The same proposition is laid by the Apex Court in another decision
reported in [AIR 2021 SC 2627 : 2021 KHC 6284], Satbir Singh
& anr. v. State of Haryana.
24. In the decision reported in [AIR 2004 SC 1714], Baljeet
Singh v. State of Haryana the Apex Court set out the condition
precedent for establishing offence under Section 304B of I.P.C as
a)      That a married woman had died otherwise than under
normal circumstances;
b)      such death was within 7 years of her marriage; and
c)      the prosecution has established that there was cruelty
and harassment in connection with the demand for dowry soon
25. In another decision reported in [AIR 2009 SC 913],
Baldev Singh v. State of Punjab the expression “soon before her
death” used in the substantive section of 304B of I.P.C and Section
113B of the Evidence Act is present with the idea of proximity test.
No definite period has been indicated and the expression “soon
before” is not defined. A reference to expression “soon before” in
Section 114 illustration (a) of the Evidence Act is relevant. It lays
down that a man who is in the possession of goods “soon after
theft” is either the thief or has received the goods knowing the
same to be stolen, unless he can account for his possession. The
determination of the period which can come with the term `soon
before' is left to be determined by the courts depending upon facts
and circumstances of each case. Suffice, however, to indicate that
the expression “soon before” would normally imply that the
interval should not be much between the concerned cruelty or
harassment and the death in question.
26. In the same decision, in para.17 it was observed as
“The law on Section 304-B IPC and Section 113-B of the
Evidence Act has been pithily summarised as follows:
(1)    Section 304-B IPC must be interpreted keeping in
mind the legislative intent to curb the social evil of bride burning
and dowry demand.
(2)    The prosecution must at first establish the existence
of the necessary ingredients for constituting an offence under
Section 304B IPC.       Once these ingredients are satisfied, the
rebuttable presumption of casualty, provided under Section 113B
of the Evidence Act operates against the accused.
(3)    The phrase “soon before” as appearing in Section
304B IPC cannot be construed to mean “immediately before”.
The prosecution must establish existence of “proximate and live
link” between the dowry death and cruelty or harassment for
dowry demand by the husband or his relatives.
(4)    Section 304B IPC does not take a pigeonhole
approach in categorising death as homicidal or suicidal or
accidental. The reason for such non-categorisation is due to the
fact that death occurring “otherwise than under normal
circumstances” can, in cases, be homicidal or suicidal or
accidental.”
27.     In the said judgment while confirming the conviction
imposed by the trial court and the High Court under Section 304B
and under Section 498A of I.P.C, the Apex Court also upheld
acquittal found by the High Court under Section 306 of I.P.C.
28. In another decision reported in [2022 Cri.LJ 2545 : AIR
OnLine 2022 SC 577], Devender Singh and Ors. v. State of
Uttarakhand, another 3 Bench decision, the Apex Court considered
the ingredients of Section 304B of I.P.C within the ambit of Section
113B of the Evidence Act and finally confirmed conviction
imposed against the husband under Section 304B of I.P.C while
acquitting appellants 2 and 3 on the finding that there is no specific
role with regard to the demand of dowry and nor any specific
instances of cruelty and harassment been ascribed to the appellants
2 and 3 except for the general assertion against appellants 2 and 3.
29. In a latest decision of the Apex Court reported in
[(2022) 5 SCC 401], State of Madhya Pradesh v. Jogendra & anr.,
3 Bench of the Apex Court considered the menace of dowry death
while dealing with a case alleging commission of offences under
Section 304B, 498A and Section 306 of I.P.C. In the said case also
the Apex Court in para.9 set forth the following as the most
fundamental constituent for attracting the provisions of Section
304B of I.P.C.
(i) that the death of a woman must have been caused by
burns or bodily injury or occurred otherwise than under normal
(ii)    that such a death must have occurred within a period
of seven years of her marriage;
(iii)   that the woman must have been subjected to cruelty
or harassment at the hands of her husband, soon before her
(iv)     that such a cruelty or harassment must have been for or related
to any demand for dowry.
30. Thus when the four essentials required to prove offence
under Section 304B, viz;              (i) death of a woman should have
occurred otherwise than under normal circumstances (ii) within 7
years of her marriage; (iii) soon before her death she should have
been subjected to cruelty or harassment by the accused, and (iv) in
connection with any demand for dowry to presume that the accused
has committed dowry death.
31. Once the prosecution succeeded in establishing that the
death of the lady was the outcome of cruelty or harassment by her
husband or any relative of her husband soon before her death
within a period of 7 years of her marriage, if the accused wants
protection from the said catch, the burden is on him to disprove and
if he fails to rebut the presumption under Section 113B of the
Evidence Act, the court is bound to act on it. To put it differently,
Section 113B of the Evidence Act, casts a reverse burden on the
accused to disprove the prosecution case. Then the question is;
what is the standard of proof in cases involving reverse burden?
The Apex Court considered the same in the decision reported in
[(2008) 16 SCC 417 : 2008 KHC 5054], Noor Aga v. State of
Punjab & anr., while interpreting the provisions of the Narcotic
Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985, wherein also a
reverse burden is cast upon the accused. In this judgment, the
Apex Court considered the draconian provisions in the NDPS Act
and it was held that though the Act contains draconian provisions,
it must, however be borne in mind that the Act was enacted having
regard to the mandate contained in international conventions on
narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances.       Only because the
burden of proof under certain circumstances is placed on the
accused, the same, by itself, would not render the impugned
provisions unconstitutional. It was concluded in the said judgment
that Sections 35 and 54 are not ultra-vires the Constitution of India
and ultimately it has been held that the constitutionality of a penal
provision placing burden of proof on the accused must be tested on
the anvil of the State's responsibility to protect innocent citizens.
Even then, an initial burden exists upon the prosecution and only
when it stands satisfied, the reverse burden would arise and the
standard of proof required to prove the guilt of the accused on the
prosecution is `beyond all reasonable doubt'.                          But it is
`preponderance of probabilities' on the accused. Thus the law is
clear on the point that proof of reverse burden shall be discharged
on the basis of `preponderance of probabilities'.
32. In the decision reported in [AIR 2001 SCC 2828],
Satwir Singh v. State of Punjab, the Apex Court considered the
meaning of dowry and it was held that some customary payment in
connection with birth of a child or other ceremonies are prevalent
in different societies. Such payments are not enveloped within the
ambit of “dowry”. Hence, the dowry mentioned in Section 304B
should be any property or valuable security given or agreed to be
given in connection with the marriage.
33. Coming to Section 306 of I.P.C, the ingredients to
constitute an offence under Section 306 may be useful. Section
306 provides as under:
“306. Abetment of suicide.—If any person commits suicide,
whoever abets the commission of such suicide, shall be punished with
imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to ten
years, and shall also be liable to fine.
Classification of Offence:-- The offence under this section is cognizable,
non-bailable, non-compoundable and triable by Court of Session.
34. In the decision reported in [AIR 1989 SC 378 : (1989) 1
anr. v. State of Haryana, the Apex Court held that in order to
convict any person for instigating any person to commit suicide, it
has to be established that the victim committed suicide.
35.      In the decision reported in [(2001) 9 SCC 618 : 2002
SCC (Crl) 1088], Ramesh Kumar v. State of Chattisgarh, the
Apex Court held that Sections 498A and 306, I.P.C are independent
and constitute different offences. Though, depending on the facts
and circumstances of an individual case, subjecting a woman to
cruelty may amount to an offence under Section 498A and may
also, if a course of conduct amounting to cruelty is established
leaving no other option for the woman except to commit suicide,
amount to abetment to commit suicide. However, merely because
an accused has been held liable to be punished under Section
498A, I.P.C, it does not follow that on the same evidence he must
also and necessarily be held guilty of having abetted the
commission of suicide by the woman concerned.
36. Coming to Section 306, wherein also presumption of
abetment is embodied under Section 113A of the Evidence Act,
1872. Section 113A of the Evidence Act, 1872 is extracted
“Section 113-A: Presumption as to abetment of suicide by a
married woman:-- When the question is whether the commission of
suicide by a woman had been abetted by her husband or any relative of
her husband and it is shown that she had committed suicide within a
period of seven years from the date of her marriage and that her husband
or such relative of her husband had subjected her to cruelty, the Court
may presume, having regard to all the other circumstances of the case,
that such suicide had been abetted by her husband or by such relative of
her husband.
Explanation:-- For the purposes of this section, “cruelty” shall
have the same meaning as in section 498A, Indian Penal Code, 1860.”
37. In the decision reported in [2014 CrLJ 2425 : AIR 2014
SC 1782], Mangat Ram v. State of Haryana, the Apex Court held
that a woman may attempt to commit suicide due to various
reasons, such as depression, financial difficulties, disappointment
in love, tired of domestic worries, acute or chronic ailments and so
on and need not be due to abetment.
38. In this case, Ext.P4 diary has been given emphasis by
the accused to rebut the presumption under Section 113B of the
Evidence Act. In Ext.P4, alleged to be written by Suja just before
her death, there is recital to the effect that the husband or his men
had no role in the death and the death was the like of Suja.
According to the accused, the entry in Ext.P4 was written by Suja
just before her death and the same would go to show that the
accused are innocent. The prosecution forwarded the entries in
Ext.P4 with the admitted hand writings of Suja, marked as Ext.P2
series, for comparison to ensure as to whether the text in Ext.P4
was written by Suja before her death. Ext.P12 is the report. As per
Ext.P12 it was reported as under:
“The questioned documents in this case were carefully and
thoroughly examined and compared with standard documents in all
aspects of handwriting identification and detection of forgery with
scientific aids in the State Laboratory at Thiruvananthapuram. The
results of examination are the following.
2.      The person who wrote the red enclosed standard
writings stamped and marked A3 to A10 probably also wrote the red
enclosed questioned writings similarly stamped and marked Q1 and
3.     It has not been possible to arrive at any conclusion
regarding the authorship of the red enclosed questioned signature
stamped and marked Q1(a) in comparison with the red enclosed
standard writings similarly stamped and marked A3 to A10.”
Thus the evidence as per Ext.P12 does not suggest that the entries
in Ext.P4 are actually written by Suja. The trial court considered
the authenticity of the handwriting in Ext.P4 diary. It has been
observed that evidence of PW5 that the police recovered Ext.P4 on
the date of occurrence from the place of occurrence could not be
believed as it has been established in evidence that PW5 produced
the same before the Investigating Officer and it was taken into
custody as per Ext.P5 mahazar, as categorically deposed by PW6,
who witnessed Ext.P5 recovery mahazar. It has been observed
further that if the deceased had any intention to reveal the cause
which led to her suicide, there was no possibility of the suicide note
being concealed in the almirah which might not come to the
immediate notice of any person entering the room, where Ext.P4
was kept. It has been observed further that the only one writing in
the diary is this suicide note and no other entries could be found in
the diary are reasons to disbelieve Ext.P4. Similarly, the trial court
observed that there was nothing in Ext.P4 to indicate that it was
being used by Suja prior to her death regularly. In fact, in Ext.P4
the only one entry is the disputed text to the effect that Suja
committed suicide on her volition. That apart, Ext.P4 also did not
suggest that Ext.P4 was written by Suja.
39. In fact, the reasons stated by the learned Sessions Judge
to disbelieve Ext.P4 is justifiable and I do agree with the said
40. In this matter, the case advanced in defence right from
the very beginning is that the accused have no responsibility in the
suicide of Suja and Suja had committed suicide out of depression
as she felt that the marriage of her sister PW3, would not take place
as arranged since her relative, who had promised some amount to
41. In this regard, during cross examination of PW2 and
PW3 it had come in evidence that PWs 1 to 3 had visited the
residence of a relative one Prasad in Adoor to invite him for
marriage of PW3. Further, evidence of PWs 1 to 3 would suggest
that they had reached the house of the relative Prasad in Adoor for
collecting the amount offered by him, but the amount was not paid.
However, even on searching cross examination, PWs 1 to 3
emphatically denied the suggestion that Suja committed suicide
arising out of the said depression. It is relevant to note that during
cross examination, PW3 categorically stated that though the money
was not given by Prasad as expected on the date, Prasad agreed to
give the money.
42. The crucial question to be decided is whether Suja was
subjected to cruelty by demanding the offered dowry soon before
the occurrence. Reading the evidence of PW2 and PW3, demand
for the offered dowry soon after the marriage and harassment at the
hands of the 1st accused/1st appellant, repeatedly stated by them
could be gathered. It is pertinent to note that Suja committed
suicide just after one year of the marriage on 14.03.2000, after the
marriage which took place on 06.02.1999. PW2 and PW3 given
evidence that PW2 was employed as Peon in Public Works
Department, Government of Kerala and she had a chitty with
Kerala State Financial Enterprises to conduct the marriage of PW3
and ultimately PW2 stated that the marriage of PW3 was
solemnised on the date earlier fixed.        Thus the prosecution
evidence established that Suja committed suicide just after one year
of marriage and soon before her death she was subjected to cruelty
and harassment by the 1st appellant/1st accused and she committed
suicide in consequence thereof. The evidence available does not
suggest cruelty and harassment on the part of the 2nd appellant/2nd
accused in a satisfactory manner.
43. Coming to the facts of this case, as I have already
pointed out, PW2 and PW3 specifically deposed about the demand
for dowry by the 1st accused and cruelty and harassment demanding
the offered dowry soon after the marriage and continuance of the
same thereafter. While so, just after completion of one year of
married life, Suja committed suicide.         There is no reason to
disbelieve the categorical evidence given by PW2 and PW3. To be
more explicit, the evidence of PW2 and PW3 along with the other
evidence discussed in detail herein above, categorically established
the four essentials to constitute an offence under Section 304B of
IPC committed by the 1st accused. Similar is the position of the 1 st
accused as far as offence under Section 306 of IPC is concerned.
However, the allegation of cruelty and harassment on the part of
the 2nd accused not fully established in this case. That is to say, the
prosecution not succeeded in establishing that the 2nd accused
committed the offences under Section 304B and 306 of IPC by
convincing evidence. Therefore, I hold that the conviction imposed
on the 1st accused under Section 304B and 306 of IPC would
sustain. As far as the 2 nd accused is concerned, the conviction and
sentence imposed under the above Sections found to be not
44. Though it is the bounden duty of the accused to
disprove the presumption under Section 113B of the Evidence Act,
no convincing evidence forthcoming to rebut the presumption.
Therefore, I am of the view that the trial court convicted the 1 st
appellant/1st accused under Section 304B and 306 of I.P.C, in
accordance with law.       However, the conviction and sentence
imposed against the 2nd accused is not with the support of
convincing evidence and, therefore, the said conviction and
sentence are liable to be set aside.
45. Coming to the sentence imposed against the 1 st
appellant/1st accused, Section 304B of I.P.C mandates that whoever
commits dowry death shall be punished with imprisonment for a
term which shall not be less than 7 years, but which may extend to
imprisonment for life. Since the court below imposed the statutory
minimum sentence, the sentence imposed by the Sessions Court for
the offence under Section 304B of I.P.C is not liable to be
interfered and as such the same is confirmed. Similarly, for the
offence under Section 306 of I.P.C, if any person commits suicide,
whoever abets the commission of suicide, shall be punished with
imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to
10 years and shall also be liable to fine. The Sessions Court
imposed rigorous imprisonment for a period of 3 years for the
offence under Section 306 of I.P.C, without imposing any fine.
The said procedure adopted by the learned Sessions Judge is
illegal. It is to be borne in mind that when the statute imposes
imprisonment and fine, the same shall be read in `conjunctive' and
not `disjunctive'. Therefore, both forms of punishment shall be
imposed. Since there is no statutory minimum sentence for the
offence under Section 306 of I.P.C, I am inclined to reduce the said
sentence for a period of 2 years and impose a fine of Rs.20,000/-
(Rupees Twenty thousand only). In default of payment of fine, the
1st accused shall undergo default rigorous imprisonment for a
46. In the result, this appeal is allowed in part.        The
conviction and sentence imposed against the 2 nd accused stand set
aside and the 2nd accused is acquitted for the offences under Section
304B and 306 r/w 34 of I.P.C. The bail bond executed by the 2 nd
appellant/2nd accused shall stand cancelled and she is set at liberty
47. The conviction imposed against the 1st appellant/1st
accused for the offences under Section 304B and 306 r/w 34 of
I.P.C is confirmed while modifying the sentence as under:
i) The 1st appellant/1st accused shall undergo rigorous
imprisonment for a period of 7 years for the offence punishable
under Section 304B of I.P.C.
ii) The 1st appellant/1st accused shall undergo rigorous
imprisonment for a period of one year and to pay fine of
Rs.20,000/- (Rupees Twenty thousand only) for the offence
punishable under Section 306 of I.P.C. In default of payment of
fine, he shall undergo rigorous imprisonment for a period of one
month. Set off is allowed for the period the 1st appellant/1st accused
had been in custody in connection with this crime.
Regarding destruction of M.Os 1 to 4, the order passed by the
Sessions Judge is confirmed.
Bail bond executed by the 1st appellant stands cancelled and
the 1st accused/1st appellant is directed to surrender before the trial
court within 10 days from today to undergo the sentence.
