1.         By the present Writ Petition, Petitioner takes exception to
the orders dated (i) 20.09.2019 passed by Respondent No. 4 - State of
Maharashtra, (ii) 08.02.2019 passed by Respondent No. 1 – Collector
of Nasik and (iii) 04.12.2018 passed by Respondent No. 2 – The
2.         Respondent No. 1 is the licensing authority under the
Maharashtra Prohibition Act, 1949 (for short “the said Act”). Petitioner
is the citizen of India and resident of Village Peth, District Nashik.
Respondent No. 3 holds a CL III license under the said Act.
Respondent No. 1 – Collector of Nasik passed order dated 08.02.2019
permitting Respondent No. 3 to shift his CL III license from the
existing premises to the new premises. This permission was granted by
the Collector after obtaining prior permission of the Commissioner on
3.         Admittedly Respondent No. 3 is carrying on business of
Restaurant and Bar in the name and style of M/s Hotel Mohana
Garden since 1996. The Excise Department has duly approved the plan
of the said hotel with Restaurant and Permit Room on Plot No. 284.
The said Restaurant and Bar was shut down pursuant to the order
passed by the Supreme Court on 15.12.2016 since the same was
abutting the National highway. Respondent No. 3 thereafter
constructed a wall on three sides of Plot No. 284 in order to restrict
the entry from the highway and thereafter made fresh Application to
the Competent Authority seeking a license on the ground that the
distance from the highway to the entrance of the restaurant was in
excess of the ceiling permissible under the order passed by the
4.         Respondent No. 3 also procured a CL III license. Admittedly
CL III license did not fall within the restricted distance from the
highway and is unaffected by the Supreme Court judgment.
Respondent No. 3, therefore, made an Application to the Competent
Authority for allowing him to shift his license and conduct his business
on the basis of CL III license separately from the Restaurant and Hotel
namely Hotel Mohana Garden Bar & Restaurant which was in
operation from Plot No. 284.
5.         Though admittedly for the purpose of CL III license, the
restriction of the distance from highway was not applicable, the Sub-
Inspector of State Excise procured information from the Executive
Engineer of the National Highway authority, who certified that the
distance of the hotel premises was 235 meters away from the National
Highway No. 848. A plan was also annexed to the certificate for
distance dated 18.07.2017 issued by the Excise Department.
Respondent No. 3 submitted an affidavit dated 19.06.2017 stating that
the establishment was beyond the restrictive distance from 220 meters
from the National Highway and also undertook to satisfy the other
applicable conditions.
6.         Petitioner is the resident of the area in the vicinity of Plot
No. 284. On being asked, it is informed across the bar that Petitioner’s
residential house is at a distance of 500 meters from Plot No. 284.
7.         It is Petitioner’s case that several persons residing in the
vicinity of Plot No. 284 have objected to the commencement of the
Country Liquor Bar under CL III license issued to Respondent No. 3 by
filing objections and complaints to the Statutory Authorities. Petitioner
has thereafter referred to a series of correspondence between the
officers of the Respondents Nos. 1 and 2. However, Petitioner’s
objection is to the fact that Respondent No. 3 has been permitted to
operate his CL III license from the premises of Hotel Mohana Garden
on Plot No. 284 where the Respondent No. 3 was also granted a FL III
8.         By order dated 08.02.2019, Respondent No. 1 – The
Collector of Nasik permitted Respondent No. 3 to shift his CL III
license from Ozar, Taluka Niphad, District Nashik to Gat No. 233, Plot
No 284 Taluka Peth, District Nashik after receiving prior permission
from Respondent No. 2 – The Commissioner of State Excise on
9.         Petitioner being aggrieved filed a Revision Application and
Application for stay to the said order. Respondent No. 4 granted an
interim order dated 14.08.2019 staying the orders passed by the
Collector and the Commissioner State Excise. Thereafter, Respondent
No. 4 heard the Revision Application finally and passed order on
20.09.2019 rejecting the same and vacated the interim stay order
dated 14.08.2019 and upheld the orders viz. dated 04.12.2018 passed
by Respondent No. 2 and 08.02.2019 passed by Respondent No. 1.
10.       Mrs. Thadani, learned Advocate appearing for Petitioner
would submit that the orders impugned are bad in law in view of the
following reasons:
(i)      that   they  are   passed   in  contravention      of
considering the restricted distance of the subject
premises from the National Highway; that infact
the subject premises are abutting the National
Highway and after grant of license, Respondent
No. 3 has demolished the wall on the southern
side thereby having direct access to the subject
premises from the National Highway; that in view
of this, the subject premises which also house
Mohana Garden permit room under the FL III
license now stands abutting the National Highway;
(ii)     that Peth Nagar Parishd has not given its NOC to
Respondent No. 3 for commencement of a Country
Liquor Bar from Plot No. 284 and in the absence of
the same the license ought not to have been
(iii) that by virtue of shifting of the CL III license,
Respondent No. 3 has violated the distance
condition from the National Highway in respect of
the FL III license;
(iv)  that by virtue of the impugned orders, Respondent
No. 3 has been permitted to commence the
business     of  selling   Country   Liquor    in     a
predominantly      residential  area  and    as    per
government regulations, commercial activity is
prohibited in premises abutting the road which is
less than 12 meters; that there is violation of the
conditions mentioned in government resolution
dated 21.11.2018;
(v)   that Respondent No. 3 has produced a bogus NOC
of the Nagar Parishad and relied upon bogus
documents to procure permission for his CL III
(vi)  that as a concession for only licenses affected by
the   Judgment      of   the   Supreme   Court,     on
07.06.2017 the Government issued a Circular
exempting licenses affected by the said Judgment
from procuring “NOC of the local body” as
mandated in Rule 25, if the licence was being
shifted in the same District. A period of one year
was given for obtaining NA certificate for the
premises etc.;
(vii)        that the mandatory requirement in Rule 25 of the
Maharashtra Country Liquor Rules, 1973 for
obtaining “No Objection of the Municipal Council”
was sought to be relaxed by the State Government
by a mere Circular, which is not legally tenable;
(viii)       that in view of the above submissions the
impugned orders deserve to be set aside and that
the CL III license granted to the Petitioner be
cancelled.
11.       PER CONTRA, Mr. Patil, learned Advocate for Respondent
No. 3 has made the following submissions:-
(i)    that the Petitioner has no locus to file the present
Petition as he is neither concerned with the license of
this Respondent        or license of Mr. Kanade and
therefore, the Petition though styled as Writ Petition is
actually a P.I.L. not public interest litigation but
personal interest litigation and therefore, the same is
liable to be dismissed with heavy costs;
(ii) that the main objections raised by the Petitioner is
distance from State highway less than 220 mtrs;
however the Engineer from the PWD department has
submitted his report and the same is neither challenged
not the subject matter in the Petition;
(iii) that Petitioner has in the course of his submission
stated that his layout is near the premises of the
Respondent.      However, he has not produced any
documents to that effect but actually resides more than
2 km. away from the premises of the Respondent
wherein Respondent is carrying on his business
(iv) that it is alleged that there are several complaints filed
in respect of Respondent’s premises but it is pertinent
to note that under the jurisdiction of Peth Municipal
Council area there are 1 CL-III and 4 FL-III licenses
which are functioning. Petitioner has no objection for
functioning of the said licenses in the Municipal
Council Area and this clearly shows that the Petitioner
has not approached this Court with clean hands and
also suppressed material facts from this Court;
(v) that it is alleged that Commercial NA is not submitted
by the Respondent.      In this regard, it is stated that
Commercial NA for Plot No. 284 was granted by the
Sub-Divisional Officer Nashik on 10.01.1996. Further
the Chief Officer Peth Municipal Council vide its order
dated 31.03.2021 granted Commercial NA permission
to Survey No. / Gat No. 233 (old 337) Plot No. 284
admeasuring 495 sq. mtrs.       Thereafter by exercising
powers under Section 44 of the Maharashtra Land
Revenue Code, 1966 the Sub-Divisional Officer Dindori
vide its order dated 19.01.2022 granted the permission
of change of user from residential to commercial of the
(vi) that in the event if the license holder commits any
breach or violation in provisions in that event Section
54 of the Maharashtra Prohibition Act empower the
licensing authority to suspend or cancel the license and
Section 56 of the said Act empowers the licensing
authority to cancel the license by recording reason in
writing.    Since the Respondent is carrying business
strictly in accordance with the Maharashtra Prohibition
Act 1949, the Maharashtra Country Liquor Rules 1973
and circular issued from Government of Maharashtra,
Commissioner of State Excise and Collector of Nashik,
no action under Sections 54 or 56 has been initiated till
date.
12.       Mr. Patil and the        learned   AGP    appearing for the
Respondents have both supported the impugned orders and submitted
that the transfer application of Respondent No. 3 was thoroughly
inquired into and verified by Respondent No. 1 through the Inspector
for State Excise who opined that the subject premises were situated at
a distance of 235 meters away from the National Highway No. 848;
that there is no educational or religious institution or statue of any
national leader within the distance of 100 meters from the subject
premises; that construction of the proposed subject premises was
complete in all respect; that in the case for shifting of license in the
case of Respondent No. 3, it was permissible if the rules, guidelines
and circular were adhered to and as such the Petition was devoid of
merit and deserved to be dismissed.
12.1.     That apart, it was contended that the Petition filed by the
Petitioner is not maintainable since the Petitioner did not object to the
application for shifting of Respondent No. 3’s CL III license to the
subject premises and it is only after the same was allowed, the
Petitioner has filed the present Petition seeking a Writ of Certiorari.
12.2.      That the petition filed by the Petitioner is a malafide and
colourable exercise of power borne out of jealousy and an extortionist
reason without the Petitioner having any nexus whatsoever with the
12.3.      Hence the Respondents have prayed for dismissal of the
13.        I have heard the learned Advocates appearing for the parties
and with their able assistance, perused the record and pleading in the
present case.
14.        At the outset, it is seen that the locus of the Petitioner in
filing the present Petition is required to be seen. The Petition is not
filed as a Public Interest Litigation. Though it is argued across the bar
that having a Country Liquor bar in the predominantly residential area
is detrimental to the residents of the area, the said submissions
however do not find mention in any of the pleadings. Challenge to the
Petitioner’s CL III license is on account of non-compliance of certain
statutory conditions by Respondent No. 3. However, whether the
Petitioner is entitled to maintain the said challenge and whether the
proceedings under the Article 227 of the Constitution of India are
maintainable is the moot question which needs to be addressed at the
outset. The impugned order for granting license is passed by the
Collector. Respondent No. 2 Commissioner has given his consent to
Respondent No. 1 after following the due process of law to grant the
license. Respondent No. 1 is the licensing authority who has granted
the license. Admittedly, Petitioner never objected or was not a party to
the original Application seeking transfer of the CL III license from Ozar
to the subject premises in Peth. The Petition as seen is not filed by the
Petitioner in a representative capacity on behalf of the residents in the
area. Therefore, the Petitioner has no locus standi to file the present
15.        That apart perusal of record clearly reveals that the manner
in which the Petition is drafted is an abuse of the process of law. It is
seen that the Petition proceeds on the basis of the violation of
fundamental rights of the Petitioner under Article 14 and Article 21 of
the Constitution of India. However, Petitioner has not given any event
or incident as to how his fundamental rights are violated. On the
contrary the Respondent No. 3’s right under article 19(1)(g) to carry
on trade and business by following the due process of law is in fact
hampered on the allegations of the Petitioner. Record clearly indicates
that the Licensing Authority has followed the due process of law in
granting the license. The entire gamut of documentary material i.e.
Application, NOC, permissions etc. have all been enumerated in the
affidavit-in-reply  filed by   Respondent No. 3 and is confirmed by
Respondent Nos. 1, 2 and 4 in its affidavit-in-reply dated 12.03.2021.
All such necessary documents namely Application, NOC, permission,
affidavits, orders, etc. are all appended to the affidavit-in-reply of the
Respondent No. 3. That apart, the Statutory Authority has confirmed
on affidavit that the transfer application in respect of Respondent No 3
was thoroughly inquired into by Respondent No. 1 only after following
the due process of law the same has been issued. Record also indicates
that Respondent No. 3 has received N.A. Permission for Plot No. 284
in the year 1996 and copy of the same is produced on record. Hence,
this objection of the Petitioner also does not survive. Record clearly
indicates that the FL III license premises and CL III license premises
are both running independently from Plot No. 284 with separate
entrances and there is no violation of any conditions or rule by
Respondent No. 3. That both the premises are separate and distinct.
Needless to state that if there is any violation by Respondent No. 3 of
any rules under the Maharashtra Country Liquor Rules 1973, the
Statutory Authorities shall take cognizance and action in accordance
with law.
16.        In view of the above observations and findings, Writ Petition
fails and deserves to be dismissed with costs. Petitioner is directed to
pay costs of Rs. 10,000/- to the Kirtikar Law Library, High Court,
Mumbai as costs for filing the present Writ Petition. The Cost shall be
paid within a period of one week from today failing which the same
shall be recovered as arrears of land revenue by the Collector Nashik
from the Petitioner.
17.        Writ Petition is dismissed.   Though the Writ Petition is
dismissed, list the Petition on board on 01.02.2023 for compliance of
payment of costs by the Petitioner. To be placed under the caption ‘for
