Pharmacist with the respondent Sangh for a period of 11 years
continuously on a monthly salary of Rs.1,775/-. His services
came to be terminated on 31.3.1992.
2.2    Aggrieved, the petitioner raised dispute before the learned
Labour Commissioner who by order dated 31.7.1992 was
pleased to make a reference to the learned Labour Court,
Ahmedabad being Reference (LCA) No.1800 of 1992.
2.3    The parties subjected themselves to the jurisdiction of the
learned Labour Court. They led oral as well as documentary
evidence in support of their case. By judgment and award dated
7.5.2007, the learned Labour Court was pleased to dismiss the
2.4    Aggrieved, the petitioner herein has filed the present
3.     The present Special Civil Application came to be admitted
by this Court vide order dated 25.3.2008.
4.     Mr. T.R.Mishra, learned advocate appearing on behalf of
the petitioner would submit that the petitioner had put-in
continuous service of 11 years uninterruptedly as a Pharmacist
with the respondent Sangh. His services came to be terminated
on the ground that the medical store run by the respondent
Sangh was being closed. He was retrenched and amounts of
Rs.13,410/- and Rs.49,314/- were paid by cheque to the
petitioner towards the legal dues which included retrenchment
compensation and other terminal benefits. He further submitted
that instead of closing the medical store, the respondent Sangh
had given the said medical store on rent to somebody to run the
same and therefore, the termination of the petitioner was bad in
law and not in accordance with the reasons stated in the
termination letter. The petitioner had sent a legal notice to the
respondent Sangh which was duly replied to by the learned
advocate for the respondent Sangh. It was further submitted
that false allegations were levelled against the petitioner herein
by the respondent Sangh and therefore, the learned Labour
Court ought to have lifted the veil and held that the action of
terminating the services of the petitioner on the ground of
retrenchment due to closure of the medical store was illegal and
he was retrenched without conducting any departmental inquiry
or without affording any opportunity under the guise of closure
of medical store. He has also argued that the petitioner has
placed on record an advertisement issued in February-1992 by
the respondent Sangh for the post of Pharmacist and the said
act shows that the petitioner was being removed on the false
ground of closure of medical store. He would submit that the
impugned judgment and award is bad in law and ought to be set
aside and the petitioner be reinstated in service with the
5.     Ms.      A.H.Gupta, learned     advocate   appearing         for    the
respondent Sangh opposed the present Special Civil Application
and submitted that the respondent Sangh had decided to close
the medical store business as it was running in loss and that as
per the new arrangement, all the Taluka level societies were to
run their own medical stores. Therefore, by resolution dated
24.2.1992, the respondent Sangh in its Managing Committee
meeting decided to close the medical store since it was running
in losses and it was resolved that the employees of the medical
stores would be retrenched in accordance with law. Accordingly,
the petitioner was paid his dues by cheque which has been duly
encashed by him and he has been retrenched in accordance with
law and therefore, no interference is called for. It was further
submitted that even though the advertisement was issued by the
respondent Sangh, it was not acted upon, no applications were
considered and no any Pharmacist was appointed after closure
of the business of medical store and therefore, it cannot be said
that the petitioner has been prejudiced by being retrenched. It is
further submitted that after the classification by the State
Government of Gandhinagar District into Jilla and Taluka
separately, the respondent establishment had no longer control,
charge and administration or hold over the property held by it
earlier before such classification. After the classification, the said
property which is situated in the Civil Hospital compound came
to be owned by the Gandhinagar Taluka Sahkari Kharid Vechan
Sangh and even the respondent Sangh shifted its office from the
said Civil Hospital compound. Therefore, the medical store,
which was earlier run by the respondent Sangh had become the
property of Gandhinagar Taluka Sahkari Kharid Vechan Sangh
and the present respondent Sangh has nothing to do with the
said property. Further, after passing of the resolution dated
29.2.1992, the said medical store was rented to one Natubhai
Becharbhai Chaudhary on rent note agreement for a period of 3
years from 1.3.1992 along with furniture after selling the
medical stock of medicines. The respondent Sangh does not have
any control or administration over the working of the medical
store since the said premises has been rented out. After the
classification into District and Taluka, the rent of the medical
store is now being collected by the Gandhinagar Taluka Sahkari
Kharid Vechan Sangh which is the owner and the respondent
Sangh has not at all any further concern with the same. It was
submitted that the impugned award passed by the learned
Labour Court is just, proper and legal and therefore, the same
should be upheld.
6.     Heard learned counsel for the parties and perused the
documents on record.
7.     While adjudicating the reference, the learned Labour Court
has framed five issues. All the five issues have been adjudicated
on the basis of evidence on record. It is seen from the evidence
brought on record that the respondent Sangh was initially
holding charge of both, the Jilla and Talukas of Gandhinagar
district and was functioning on no profit no loss basis. Since the
business of medical store was running in losses, it was resolved
by the Managing Committee of the respondent Sangh vide
resolution dated 24.2.1992 to relieve two employees which
included the petitioner herein after following due procedure of
law and to retrench them since the respondent Sangh wanted to
exist from the business of medical store. Accordingly, in
accordance with the said resolution, the business of medical
store was closed and the services of the petitioner came to be
retrenched. Amount of Rs.13,410/- was paid vide cheque
No.114398 and Rs.49,314/- was paid vide cheque No.158224
towards the legal dues, which included the retrenchment
compensation and other terminal benefits which has been
admittedly received by the petitioner and duly encashed also.
The main grievance of the petitioner is that instead of closing
down the medical store, the respondent Sangh had rented out
the medical store to a third person and therefore, in that
background, his retrenchment is illegal. It was also argued that
the     respondent   Sangh    had      issued advertisement           dated
16.2.1992 inviting applications for Pharmacist in its medical
store. However, no further evidence brought on record to show
that pursuant to such advertisement, any person was appointed
as Pharmacist by the respondent Sangh. On the contrary, by
way of evidence, the respondent Sangh has brought on record
that as per its Managing Committeeâ€™s resolution, the medial
store was closed, its stock was sold and only the store premises
with fixed furniture therein was rented out to a third person,
who would run the medical store at his own cost and expenses
while giving a fixed rent to the respondent Sangh. Therefore, it is
seen that after the retrenchment of the petitioner, no person has
been appointed as a Pharmacist by the respondent Sangh and
that they have closed down their business of running medical
store in the Civil Hospital compound, Gandhinagar. By way of
affidavit-in-reply to the present Special Civil Application, it has
been further brought on record by affidavit that subsequently,
the State Government has classified the Jilla Sangh into Jilla
and Taluka Sanghs. In pursuance of the same, the said medical
store property has gone to the share and has been transferred to
Gandhinagar Taluka Sahkari Kharid Vechan Sangh and the
respondent Sangh does not have any control over the said
premises subsequently. It is further stated on affidavit that the
rent is also being now collected by the        Gandhinagar Taluka
Sahkari Kharid Vechan Sangh subsequent to the orders by the
8.      The evidence and documents on record reveal that the
business of the medical store has been closed down by the
respondent Sangh. The petitioner has been retrenched in
accordance with law after payment of all the retrenchment
compensation and other terminal benefits which has been duly
accepted by the petitioner.
In view of the same and for the aforesaid reasons, this
Court finds no infirmity in the impugned judgment and award
passed by the learned Labour Court. Therefore, the present
Special Civil Application is dismissed with no order as to costs.
Rule is discharged.
