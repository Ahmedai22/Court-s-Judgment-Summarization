Counsel for Respondent :- C.S.C.,Pranesh Dutt Tripathi
Heard learned counsel for the petitioner; learned Standing
Counsel appearing on behalf of respondent no.1 and Sri Pranesh
Dutt Tripathi, learned counsel for respondent no.2.
This writ petition has been filed praying for direction to the
respondent no.2, i.e., District Basic Education Officer, Kushinagar,
to grant compassionate appointment to the petitioner on any
suitable post as per her educational qualification on account of
death of her husband, Late Yantish Dev Jha, within some fixed
period of time.
The brief facts of the petition are that the husband of the
petitioner was appointed as Assistant Teacher in the Basic School
run under the Uttar Pradesh Basic Education Board, Allahabad at
Kushinagar. The husband of the petitioner was appointed by the
order of District Basic Education Officer, Kushinagar, dated
21.9.2015 and he died on 23.9.2021 in harness. The petitioner is
widow of the deceased having one year old daughter, Gyanvi Jha.
She made an application dated 30.11.2021 before the respondent
no.2 to grant compassionate appointment to her duly supported by
documents. An objection was raised by the             District Basic
Education Officer, Kushinagar, regarding some documents not
being annexed with the application for compassionate appointment
made by the petitioner. The petitioner, thereafter, provided the
certificate issued by Sub Divisional Magistrate, Sadar, District
Bareilly giving details of the members of the family of the
deceased. In the certificate, the petitioner, her minor daughter and
father of the deceased, namely, Har Prasad Sharma, were
mentioned as legal heirs of the deceased.
The petitioner has qualification of B.Sc., B.Ed., and C.T.E.T.
and is entitled to get appointment on compassionate basis as per
her qualification. She has no source of income and after the death
of her husband, she has reached the stage of starvation alongwith
her one year old child.
A counter affidavit has been filed on the behalf of the District
Basic Education Officer, Kushinagar, wherein it has been admitted
that petitioner’s husband, Yantish Dev Jha, died in harness on
23.9.2021 while working as Assistant Teacher in the School of
Basic Education Board. The petitioner made an incomplete
application and therefore,        District Basic Education Officer,
Kushinagar, sent a letter dated 14.12.2021 to supply the essential
documents. In the meantime, her father-in-law, Har Prasad
Sharma, sent a registered letter dated 10.01.2022 to the Block
Education Officer, Moti Chak, Kushinagar, by forwarding a copy to
District Magistrate, Kushinagar. Her father-in-law alleged in the
letter that the petitioner was harassing his son due to which he
became ill and later died on 23.9.2021. He further stated that on
account of cruelty meted out by the petitioner to his son, he had
died. Thereafter, brother-in-law of the petitioner, namely, Jhadev
Sharma, lodged the F.I.R. against the petitioner and her brother
and sisters alleging that his brother was appointed as Assistant
Teacher in the primary school at Kushinagar in the year 2015 and
the petitioner was married to him on 26.8.2018. The behaviour of
the petitioner with her husband was not good and she used to
humiliate him. By hatching conspiracy she got her younger sister
married to the informant. Both the sisters started misbehaving with
the family members of her matrimonial home. On 22.8.2021, she
alongwith her sister have broken household goods and abused the
family members. When the police came, the situation came under
control. The petitioner had threatened her brother-in-law of slitting
his neck on phone. Number of other wild allegations have made in
the F.I.R. lodged against the petitioner by her brother-in-law
Father of the deceased has also sent a Will dated 29.8.2021
of his son, Yantish Jha, executed in his favour to the District Basic
Education Officer, Kushinagar and he has in turn forwarded the
same to Block Education Officer, Moti Chak, Kushinagar, to verify
the same. On account of the aforesaid facts, the compassionate
appointment of the petitioner is pending.
After hearing the rival submissions and before proceeding
with the facts of this case, it would be relevant to consider the
relevant provisions of the U.P. Recruitment of Dependents of
Government Servants Dying in Harness, Rules 1974. Rule 2 (c)
defines “family” of the deceased Government servant, as including
“wife or husband, sons and unmarried and widowed daughters”.
Rule 6 specifies the contents of the application for seeking
compassionate       appointment     and    following   informations  are
required from the persons applying for the same:-
(a) the date of the death of the deceased Government servant; the
department in which he was working and the post which he was
holding prior to his death;
(b) names, age and other details pertaining to all the members of
the family of the deceased, particularly about their marriage,
employment and income;
(c) details of the financial condition of the family; and
(d) the educational and other qualifications, if any, of the applicant.
As per Rule 8, a candidate seeking appointment must not be
less than 18 years at the time of appointment.
In the present case, the application of the petitioner made for
compassionate appointment dated 30.11.2021 clearly states the
name of the deceased employee, his place of working, and the
post he was holding, the name of the dependent, and her
relationship with the deceased. She has also filed her affidavit in
support of application alongwith the photographs of her daughter.
In the affidavit she has clearly stated that apart from the petitioner
and her minor daughter, Gyanvi Jha, deceased has not left behind
any member of his family. She has also stated that after the death
of her husband, her financial condition is pitiable and she is not
employed in any government, non-government or semi government
organization. Father of the deceased is aged about 72 years and
not entitled to grant compassionate appointment. She has clearly
stated her education qualification as B.Sc., B.Ed. C.T.E.T. and her
date of birth as 06.6.1990. She has also given undertaking that in
case she is granted compassionate appointment, she will look after
her family. She has supplied copies of her educational certificates,
marks-sheets etc., alongwith the application and certified them as
The District Basic Education Officer, Kushinagar, by his letter
dated 14.12.2021 has only ojbected that the application is defective
and the required documents/certificates are not annexed. Nothing
has been stated as to what is required by District Basic Education
Officer, Kushinagar, from the petitioner. However, the petitioner has
applied again by means of application dated 14.02.2022 before the
District Basic Education Officer, Kushinagar, giving required details
again alonwith the her educational certificates and certificate from
the office of Sub Divisional Officer, Sadar, Bareilly, certifying the
legal heirs of her deceased husband, which includes her father-in-
law and minor daughter alongwith the petitioner.
It is notable that prior to the death of the deceased neither the
father-in-law of the petitioner nor her brother-in-law had raised any
grievance against the petitioner. Only after the death of her
husband, father-in-law, Har Prasad Sharma, had produced
unregistered Will of his son in his favour before the District Basic
Education Officer, Kushinagar and her brother-in-law, Jhadev,
lodged the F.I.R. under Sections 427, 506, 504, 323 I.P.C. against
the petitioner and her brother and sister.
Obviously, the father and brother of the deceased do not
want that the petitioner may be given compassionate appointment.
Their conduct is not uncommon since the majority of the parents,
whose son dies untimely, blame his widow for his death and want
to get rid of her by resorting ho all means, fair and foul, to deprive
her of the estate of her husband. This is one such case where after
the death of husband of petitioner, her father-in-law and brother-in-
law    are    bent    upon    depriving   her    from  appointment    on
compassionate basis on account of untimely death of her husband
in harness. Their conduct shows that they will not accept her and
her minor daughter as their family members any more. In such a
situation the petitioner is absolutely helpless.
There is nothing in the counter affidavit, which may indicate
that the petitioner is gainfully employed anywhere or has any other
means of survival. She has responsibility of caring and rearing a
minor daughter aged about one year left behind by her husband
and in case she is not provided employment, it would be difficult for
her to survive and bring up on her minor daughter. Section 2 (c) of
the Rules mentioned above does not includes father-in-law or
brother-in-law within the definition of family. Admittedly, father-in-
law has at least one more son to look after him. Therefore, it is
clear that the petitioner and her minor daughter are the only
members of the family of the deceased government servant and
petitioner is entitled to compassionate appointment under the
Dying in Harness Rules. The objection being raised by her father-
in-law and brother-in-law are not to be considered as grounds of
her depriving the petitioner of her right to get compassionate
appointment. Her      implication in criminal case has only been
sought to be made by the brother-in-law of the petitioner so as to
deprive her of the benefits of compassionate appointment. Even
otherwise the offences alleged in the F.I.R. are minor in nature and
from reading of the F.I.R., it appeares to be prima facie concocted
and false at this stage. It has not been stated in the counter
affidavit about the fate of the investigation in the aforesaid F.I.R.
lodged by the brother-in-law of the petitioner and its outcome.
The unregistered Will dated 29.8.2021 of the deceased
annexed as Annexure CA-4 of the counter affidavit is absurd so far
the recital therein that after death of testator, his father should be
given compassionate appointment. The father of the deceased is
aged about 72 years and cannot be appointed in government job.
Even otherwise, unless the Will is proved before the competent
court, since it would never be acceptable to petitioner and her
minor child, no benefit of the same, regarding other benefits willed
by the deceased in favour of his father, can accrue to the
beneficiary of Will, the father of the deceased. The District Basic
Education Officer has sent the Will to the Block Education Officer
for verification, which is an absurd defence. The Block Education
Officer cannot certify a Will at all. Only civil court can grant decree
regarding genuineness of a Will.
On the overall consideration of the facts and circumstances
of the case and the conduct of the respondent no.2, District Basic
Education Officer, of keeping decision of appointment of the
petitioner on compassionate basis pending on account of grounds
which are not in accordance with law this Court is of the firm view
that positive mandamus should be issued to the respondent no.2 in
this case. The Apex Court in the case of Destruction of Public
and Private Properties Act Vs. State of A.P. and others, AIR
2009 SC 2266 has relied upon para 20 of the judgement in the
case of Comptroller And Auditor General Vs. K.S. Jagannathan
& Anr, (1986) SCR 17. In the aforesaid judgement, the Apex Court
has laid down the contingencies where positive mandamus can be
issued by the High Court in exercise of its power under Article 226
of the Constitution as follows:-
“20. There is thus no doubt that the High Courts
in India exercising their jurisdiction under Article 226
have the power to issue a writ of mandamus or a writ
in the nature of mandamus or to pass orders and give
necessary directions where the government or a
public authority has failed to exercise or has wrongly
exercised the discretion conferred upon it by a statute
or a rule or a policy decision of the government or has
exercised such discretion mala fide or on irrelevant
considerations or by ignoring the relevant
considerations and materials or in such a manner as
to frustrate the object of conferring such discretion or
the policy for implementing which such discretion has
been conferred. In all such cases and in any other fit
and proper case a High Court can, in the exercise of
its jurisdiction under Article 226, issue a writ of
mandamus or a writ in the nature of mandamus or
pass orders and give directions to compel the
performance in a proper and lawful manner of the
discretion conferred upon the government or a public
authority, and in a proper case, in order to prevent
injustice resulting to the concerned parties, the court
may itself pass an order or give directions which the
government or the public authority should have
passed or given had it properly and lawfully exercised
its discretion."
In the present case the respondent no.2 is delaying the relief
due to petitioner on account of irrelevant considerations and is
frustrating the object of the Rule of 1974. The rule was framed to
provide immediate relief by way of appointment of one member of
the family of deceased so that the family may not be pushed
towards starvation after loss of sole bread winner. In this case,
about seven months have passed and respondent no.2 is lingering
the decision because of frivolous objections from the persons who
are not member of the family of deceased as per the Rule and who
cannot get compassionate appointment at all on account of death
of the husband of the petitioner.
respondent no.2, is directed to grant compassionate appointment
to the petitioner on any suitable post, within 12 weeks from today.
In case no post is available then by creating a supernumerary post
after requesting for due sanction of a post, within 10 days from
competent authority, who shall also be bound by the time frame
fixed in this order.
