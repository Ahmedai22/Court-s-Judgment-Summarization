23.06.2011. After inquest proceedings got concluded FSL Team,
comprising of the experts from biology, serology, physics, ballistics,

of the toilet and clotted. One plastic bottle, half filled with water like
liquid, was also fond on the door of the toilet, blood was detected on

22. Dr. B.S. Arora, Additional Director and Dr. S.C. Mittal, Joint
Director, State Forensic Medicine Experts, Government of U.P. vide
their report dated 22.07.2011 opined that the death of Dr. Y.S. Sachan
did not appear to be a case of suicide.
23. The CBI, during the course of investigation, requisitioned the
services of experts of CFSL, CBI, New Delhi, along with Dr. T.D.
Dogra, Professor & Head, Department of Forensic Medicine and
Toxicology, AIIMS, New-Delhi. The experts collected certain samples
from the scene of occurrence and the place was also photographed.
During inspection, jail hospital premises was also searched to trace
any physical clue/chance, however, nothing incriminating was found.
Dr. M.S. Dahiya, Deputy Director, FSL, Gandhinagar, Gujarat also
inspected the place of occurrence. CCTV footage of cameras installed
in District Jail, Lucknow were scanned/scrutinized for movement of
any person and vehicle.
24. The CBI sought constitution of a medical board of experts at
AIIMS, New-Delhi for opinion on the nature of injuries and cause of
death. Expert opinion of the hand-writing experts of documents
seized/recovered during investigation was also sought. Polygraph
examination of suspected persons was conducted.
25. The Medical Board of AIIMS, New-Delhi was of the opinion that
the deceased could have first attempted to kill himself by inflicting
incised wounds on the known suicidal sites where arteries and veins
were situated i.e. writs, elbow, neck and inguinal region. The injuries
inflicted did not cut any artery or vein instead of superficial veins
were cut from which there was bleeding, but it was very slow. Hence,
after sometime, when the deceased realized that the injuries were not
killing him fast, he could have attempted to hang himself with the
help of belt in which he had succeeded and, therefore, the immediate
cause of death in this case was asphyxia as a result of hanging
associated with the bleeding from the injuries inflicted. This
observation was made by the Board of Doctors of AIIMS, New-Delhi
after perusing/examining postmortem report, video recording of
postmortem examination and photographs of dead-body and place of
occurrence taken on 22/23.06.2011-. The Board answered the
questions framed by the CBI in detail which is part of the
investigation report of the CBI.
26. As many as seven jail officials and one Ajmat Ullah Beg, convict,
who was working in Jail Hospital, were subjected to polygraph
examination and they denied their involvement in any foul play
relating to murder of Dr. Y.S. Sachan, and the CBI did not find their
involvement on any of the material issues. The CBI, after analyzing
its evidence and opinion of the experts, was of the view that the
deceased had committed suicide.
27. The final/closure report submitted under Section 173(2) CrPC by
the CBI had included the detailed scientific investigation with the help
of experts carried bout by the CBI which runs into several pages and
on the basis of the said detailed scientific investigation, the CBI had
concluded that Dr. Y.S. Sachan had committed suicide, and it was not
a case of homicidal death. The closure report would also disclose that
the experts, who conducted serological autopsy in respect of death of
Dr. Y.S. Sachan had found that Dr. Y.S. Sachan was under tremendous
pressure/stress after seeing newspaper reports dated 18.06.2011
wherein his involvement in murder of two CMOs was widely
reported. He was highly disturbed and shown less interest in eating
food after 18.06.2011. His blood pressure was very high. He had
written typical suicide note, which was recovered among his
belongings on the date of incident, suggests that it was in his hand-
writing. The injuries would suggest self-inflicted one, specially in
absence of definite wounds.
28. The CBI also investigated the procedure/practice for locking and
unlocking jail and counting of inmates and jail staff in District Jail,
Lucknow and actual events in this regard on 22.06.2011.
29. It is mentioned in the report that Dr. Y.S. Sachan was present in
Ward No. 2 at the time of unlocking of jail at 6 hours on 22.06.2011.
He used to wake up early in morning for morning walk. On the date
of incident, he was seen in the ward in the morning by co-inmates,
namely, Furkan, Ramkpal Verma and Kailash. Inmate Shripal Verma

his hand. Inmate, Ram Pal Verma who was allotted Bed No. 14 in
Ward No. 2 had seen Dr. Y.S. Sachan washing/cleaning his face. He
collected water in the bottle at about 7.30 hours in morning of
22.06.2011. Dr. Y.S. Sachan was wearing pant and shirt.
30. During evening counting and locking of the jail hospital, when
strength of inmates was communicated by the Head Warder, Mr. Babu
Ram Dubey to the Control Room, Chief Head Warder on duty
detected discrepancy of shortage of one inmate of Jail Hospital.
Control Room informed the same to Mr. Babu Ram Dubey and called
him in Control Room. When Mr. Babu Ram Dubey pointed out about
Dr. Y.S. Sachan went on remand, he was asked about the slip issued
by the office of Deputy Jailer, Under Trial Section, for sending Dr.
Y.S. Sachan on remand. On search, the said slip was not found
available. When this fact was cross-checked from office of Deputy

started for tracing Dr. Y.S. Sachan out.

jail hospital had no electricity supply, but there was visibility due to
percolation of lights through glass window panes of the operation
theater and toilet ventilator. Head Warder Babu Ram Dubey shouted
from 1st floor that Dr. Y.S. Sachan had been found in toilet. On hearing
shouts of Mr. Dubey, Mr. Bhimsen Mukund along with Warder Dan
Singh and others rushed to 1st floor of the jail hospital.
32. On reaching 1st floor, Mr. Bhimsen Mukund checked inside the
toilet. Dr. Y.S. Sachan was taken out from toilet and his body was kept

10/11/06/2011, he was taken to Police Station Chinhat where he was
interrogated by team of Inspector, Mr. Anil Singh and others. In the
morning of 11.06.2011, he was lodged back at District Jail, Lucknow
where he was again interrogated by Inspector, Mr. Anil Singh and
36. During interrogation, Dr. Y.S. Sachan gave a hand-written
note/letter meant to be given to Dr. A.K. Shukla, to Inspector, Mr. Anil
Singh, who in turn handed over the said letter to Mr. Subeh Kumar
Singh, the then IGP, Lucknow Zone, Lucknow. During investigation,
the said letter was produced by Mr. Subesh Kumar Singh before the
CBI.     The letter dated 11.06.2011 written by Dr. Y.S. Sachan
addressed to Dr. A.K. Shukla would read as “CMO Dr. A.K. Shukla
mai jail me bahut pareshan go gaya hon. Mere pariwar ki halat
kharab hai. Ap ne meri kuchh madad nihi kiya. Agar aap ne madad
nahi ki to agli remand ki tarikh par police va midia to bata donga ki
dono CMO ki hatya apne karwaya hai. Mere parivar ki suraksha ka
dhyan rakhiyega. Apka”.
37. The said note would indicate that both Dr. Y.S. Sachan and Dr.
A.K. Shukla were privy to murder of both the CMOs.
38. The CBI concluded after thorough, detailed and scientific
investigation from all angles, including the opinion of the experts, that
no evidence had come on record indicating death of Dr. Y.S. Sachan in
jail hospital on 22.06.2011 to be a homicide and no evidence could
come, pointing out presence of second person on 1 st floor of the toilet
of jail hospital. The evidence collected during investigation, included
statements of witnesses, expert opinion of Board of Directors of
AIIMS, New-Delhi, the reports of CFSL experts including biological
reports, physics, fingerprint, hand-writing experts, chemical examiner
& forensic psychologist all of which indicated that Dr. Y.S. Sachan
had committed suicide.
39. The evidence included circumstantial evidence which emerged
during investigation revealed that Dr. Y.S. Sachan was extremely
disturbed and stressed after disclosure of his complicity in the murder
cases of CMOs and he even stopped taking meals. The opinion of the
Board of Doctors of AIIMS, New-Delhi that the cause of death in
case of Dr. Y.S. Sachan was antemortem hanging associated with
multiple suicidal wounds was also fully got corroborated by the oral
as well as documentary evidence which came on record during
investigation. There was some omissions and commissions on the part
of Pahender Singh the then warder and Babu Ram Dubey the then
head warder for failing to do actual head count of inmates and
maintain correct entries as well as failure on the part of Mr. V.K.
Gupta then then IGP (Jail Administration and Reform Services) for
bringing on record the note written by Dr. Y.S. Sachan and causing
disappearance of the same in view of which matter was taken up by
the CBI with the Government of Uttar Pradesh for taking an
appropriate departmental action against them.
40. The closure report dated 27.09.2012 was filed by CBI under
Section 173 (2) CrPC after reaching to the conclusion that death of Dr.
Y.S. Sachan was not homicide, but suicide. The complainant filed a
protest petition alleging therein various gaps in the investigation and
prayed for further investigation.
41. The CBI filed reply to the protest petition, however, the learned
Magistrate vide order dated 22.02.2013 directed the CBI for further
investigation of the offence.
42. The CBI undertook the further investigation and filed a
supplementary closure report after investigating all the aspects
highlighted in the order of learned Magistrate as well as on each of the
allegations made by the complainant in the said protest petition; viz.
(i) the injuries were not self-inflicted (ii) recovery of blade doubtful
(iii) difference of opinion between panel of Board of Forensic
Medicine Experts, AIIMS and panel of Doctors who conducted
postmortem examination (iv) no proper investigation on belt (v) no
report on the surgical knife taken by the police from the pharmacist
(vi) statements under Section 161 CrPC of Anil Kumar Singh and
petitioner, Subesh Kumar Singh, which were recorded for the note in
question (vii) CBI's approach had been abinitio towards the
conclusion as a case of suicide (viii) CJM inquiry report; and (ix)
second opinion from Board of Experts (AIIMS).
43. The complainant was not satisfied even with the supplementary
closure report and again filed a protest petition for summoning of
seven accused persons (the petitioners) for trial of murder of Dr. Y.S.
Sachan and for causing disappearance of evidence.
44. The CBI filed reply to the protest petition.
45. The learned Magistrate vide order dated 19.11.2019 had rejected
the second final report, treating the protest petition as a complaint
case. The statement of complainant, Malti Sachan got recorded under
Section 200 CrPC and statement of six witnesses got recorded under
Section 202 CrPC. Thereafter, the impugned order was passed,
summoning the petitioners to face trial under Section 302 read with
46. The petitioners are Ex-serving government servants. There is no
prior sanction under Section 197 CrPC. Absence of sanction, as
mandated under Section 197 CrPC, would otherwise vitiate the
impugned order. In sum & substance, the allegation is for
disappearance of evidence.
47. In the case reported in (2020) 7 SCC 695 (D. Devaraja Vs. Owais
Sabeer Hussain), in respect of police officer (accused of offence),
while discharging duties, has held in paragraphs 65 to 75, which read
“65. The law relating to the requirement of sanction to
entertain and/or take cognizance of an offence, allegedly
committed by a police officer under Section 197 of the Code of
Criminal Procedure read with Section 170 of the Karnataka
Police Act, is well settled by this Court, inter alia by its
decisions referred to above.
66. Sanction of the Government, to prosecute a police officer,
for any act related to the discharge of an official duty, is
imperative to protect the police officer from facing harassive,
retaliatory, revengeful and frivolous proceedings. The
requirement of sanction from the Government, to prosecute
would give an upright police officer the confidence to discharge
his official duties efficiently, without fear of vindictive
retaliation by initiation of criminal action, from which he would
be protected under Section 197 of the Code of Criminal
Procedure, read with Section 170 of the Karnataka Police Act.
At the same time, if the policeman has committed a wrong,
which constitutes a criminal offence and renders him liable for
prosecution, he can be prosecuted with sanction from the
appropriate Government.
67. Every offence committed by a police officer does not attract
Section 197 of the Code of Criminal Procedure read with
Section 170 of the Karnataka Police Act. The protection given
under Section 197 of the Criminal Procedure Code read with
Section 170 of the Karnataka Police Act has its limitations. The
protection is available only when the alleged act done by the
public servant is reasonably connected with the discharge of his
official duty and official duty is not merely a cloak for the
objectionable act. An offence committed entirely outside the
scope of the duty of the police officer, would certainly not
require sanction. To cite an example, a policeman assaulting a
domestic help or indulging in domestic violence would certainly
not be entitled to protection. However, if an act is connected to
the discharge of official duty of investigation of a recorded
criminal case, the act is certainly under colour of duty, no
matter how illegal the act may be.
68. If in doing an official duty a policeman has acted in excess
of duty, but there is a reasonable connection between the act
and the performance of the official duty, the fact that the act
alleged is in excess of duty will not be ground enough to
deprive the policeman of the protection of the government
sanction for initiation of criminal action against him.
69. The language and tenor of Section 197 of the Code of
Criminal Procedure and Section 170 of the Karnataka Police
Act makes it absolutely clear that sanction is required not only
for acts done in discharge of official duty, it is also required for
an act purported to be done in discharge of official duty and/or
act done under colour of or in excess of such duty or authority.
70. To decide whether sanction is necessary, the test is whether
the act is totally unconnected with official duty or whether there
is a reasonable connection with the official duty. In the case of
an act of a policeman or any other public servant unconnected
with the official duty there can be no question of sanction.
However, if the act alleged against a policeman is reasonably
connected with discharge of his official duty, it does not matter
if the policeman has exceeded the scope of his powers and/or
acted beyond the four corners of law.
71. If the act alleged in a complaint purported to be filed
against the policeman is reasonably connected to discharge of
some official duty, cognizance thereof cannot be taken unless
requisite sanction of the appropriate Government is obtained
under Section 197 of the Code of Criminal Procedure and/or
Section 170 of the Karnataka Police Act.
72. On the question of the stage at which the trial court has to
examine whether sanction has been obtained and if not whether
the criminal proceedings should be nipped in the bud, there are
diverse decisions of this Court.
73. While this Court has, in D.T. Virupakshappa [D.T.
Virupakshappa v. C. Subash, (2015) 12 SCC 231 : (2016) 1
SCC (Cri) 82] held that the High Court had erred [D.T.
Virupakshappa v. C. Subash, 2013 SCC OnLine Kar 10774] in
not setting aside an order of the trial court taking cognizance of
a complaint, in exercise of the power under Section 482 of the
Criminal Procedure Code, in Matajog Dobey [Matajog Dobey
v. H.C. Bhari, AIR 1956 SC 44 : 1956 Cri LJ 140] this Court
held that it is not always necessary that the need for sanction
under Section 197 is to be considered as soon as the complaint
is lodged and on the allegations contained therein. The
complainant may not disclose that the act constituting the
offence was done or purported to be done in the discharge of
official duty and/or under colour of duty. However, the facts
subsequently coming to light in course of the trial or upon
police or judicial enquiry may establish the necessity for
sanction. Thus, whether sanction is necessary or not may have
to be determined at any stage of the proceedings.
74. It is well settled that an application under Section 482 of the
Criminal Procedure Code is maintainable to quash proceedings
which are ex facie bad for want of sanction, frivolous or in
abuse of process of court. If, on the face of the complaint, the
act alleged appears to have a reasonable relationship with
official duty, where the criminal proceeding is apparently
prompted by mala fides and instituted with ulterior motive,
power under Section 482 of the Criminal Procedure Code
would have to be exercised to quash the proceedings, to prevent
abuse of process of court.
75. There is also no reason to suppose that sanction will be
withheld in case of prosecution, where there is substance in a
complaint and in any case if, in such a case, sanction is refused,
the aggrieved complainant can take recourse to law. At the cost
of repetition, it is reiterated that the records of the instant case
clearly reveal that the complainant alleged of police excesses
while the respondent was in custody, in the course of
investigation in connection with Crime No. 12/2012. Patently,
the complaint pertains to an act under colour of duty.”
48. The learned Magistrate, while issuing summoning order, has failed
to record reasons for summoning the petitioners under Sections 302
read with Section 120-B IPC. The impugned order neither reflects an
application of mind nor it deals with the investigation reports
submitted by the CBI on every aspects and allegations.
49. As mentioned above, the CBI had filed the first closure report, and
thereafter, under the direction of learned Magistrate carried out further
investigation other than the points highlighted and had again filed the
closure report. However, the learned Magistrate has rejected both the
closure reports and treated the protest petition as a 'complaint case'.
50. The learned Magistrate, while taking cognizance on the basis of
the complaint, has to be more cautious and careful than taking
cognizance on police report as in the latter scenario, the Magistrate
had an advantage of police report, which would be filed after
collecting evidence and material by the investigating agency. In the
case in hand, the Magistrate did not have the benefit of police reports,
which are against the theory of the complainant. It was the duty of the
learned Magistrate to be more careful inasmuch as he would summon
the persons on the allegations of the complaint to face trial for an
offence under Section 302 IPC. There must be compelling reasons and
overwhelming material to discard conclusion of the investigation
reports submitted by the CBI. However, the statement of the
complainant and witnesses recorded under Section 200 and 202 CrPC
respectively would suggest that those are in respect of same
allegations which got investigated thoroughly, impartially, fairly and
scientifically by the CBI and found no substance in the theory of the
complaint. No new evidence and material has been brought on record.
There was nothing new before the learned Magistrate to take
cognizance for an offence under Section 302 IPC.
51. The allegations are against the retired/serving public/police
officers, who were acting in discharge of their official duty when the
police was carrying out investigation. The Magistrate should not have
acted on guess of the complainant. The complainant is obsesses with
new theory of gaps in the investigation by the CBI. Existence of
overwhelming material and compelling reasons is a must before
summoning a person. Summoning of a person to face trial for a
criminal case is a serious matter. The complaint in the present case
would not disclose commission of offence under Sections 302 and
52. In the case reported in (1998) 5 SCC 749 (Pepsi Foods Ltd. and
another Vs. Special Judicial Magistrate and others) in paragraph-28
it has been held as under:-
“28. Summoning of an accused in a criminal case is a serious
matter. Criminal law cannot be set into motion as a matter of
course. It is not that the complainant has to bring only two
witnesses to support his allegations in the complaint to have the
criminal law set into motion. The order of the Magistrate
summoning the accused must reflect that he has applied his
mind to the facts of the case and the law applicable thereto. He
has to examine the nature of allegations made in the complaint
and the evidence both oral and documentary in support thereof
and would that be sufficient for the complainant to succeed in
bringing charge home to the accused. It is not that the
Magistrate is a silent spectator at the time of recording of
preliminary evidence before summoning of the accused. The
Magistrate has to carefully scrutinise the evidence brought on
record and may even himself put questions to the complainant
and his witnesses to elicit answers to find out the truthfulness of
the allegations or otherwise and then examine if any offence is
prima facie committed by all or any of the accused.”
53. In the case report in (2015) 12 SCC 420 (Mehmood Ul Rehman
Vs. Khazir Mohammad Tunda and others) in paragraphs 21, 22 and
23 it has been held as under:-
"21. Under Section 190(1)(b) CrPC, the Magistrate has the
advantage of a police report and under Section 190(1)(c)
CrPC, he has the information or knowledge of commission of
an offence. But under Section 190(1)(a) CrPC, he has only a
complaint before him. The Code hence specifies that “a
complaint of facts which constitute such offence”. Therefore, if
the complaint, on the face of it, does not disclose the
commission of any offence, the Magistrate shall not take
cognizance under Section 190(1)(a) CrPC. The complaint is
simply to be rejected.
22. The steps taken by the Magistrate under Section 190(1)(a)
CrPC followed by Section 204 CrPC should reflect that the
Magistrate has applied his mind to the facts and the statements
and he is satisfied that there is ground for proceeding further in
the matter by asking the person against whom the violation of
law is alleged, to appear before the court. The satisfaction on
the ground for proceeding would mean that the facts alleged in
the complaint would constitute an offence, and when
considered along with the statements recorded, would, prima
facie, make the accused answerable before the court. No doubt,
no formal order or a speaking order is required to be passed at
that stage. The Code of Criminal Procedure requires speaking
order to be passed under Section 203 CrPC when the complaint
is dismissed and that too the reasons need to be stated only
briefly. In other words, the Magistrate is not to act as a post
office in taking cognizance of each and every complaint filed
before him and issue process as a matter of course. There must
be sufficient indication in the order passed by the Magistrate
that he is satisfied that the allegations in the complaint
constitute an offence and when considered along with the
statements recorded and the result of inquiry or report of
investigation under Section 202 CrPC, if any, the accused is
answerable before the criminal court, there is ground for
proceeding against the accused under Section 204 CrPC, by
issuing process for appearance. The application of mind is best
demonstrated by disclosure of mind on the satisfaction. If there
is no such indication in a case where the Magistrate proceeds
under Sections 190/204 CrPC, the High Court under Section
482 CrPC is bound to invoke its inherent power in order to
prevent abuse of the power of the criminal court. To be called
to appear before the criminal court as an accused is serious
matter affecting one's dignity, self-respect and image in society.
Hence, the process of criminal court shall not be made a
weapon of harassment.
23. Having gone through the order passed by the Magistrate,
we are satisfied that there is no indication on the application of
mind by the learned Magistrate in taking cognizance and
issuing process to the appellants. The contention that the
application of mind has to be inferred cannot be appreciated.
The further contention that without application of mind, the
process will not be issued cannot also be appreciated. Though
no formal or speaking or reasoned orders are required at the
stage of Sections 190/204 CrPC, there must be sufficient
indication on the application of mind by the Magistrate to the
facts constituting commission of an offence and the statements
recorded under Section 200 CrPC so as to proceed against the
offender. No doubt, the High Court is right in holding that the
veracity of the allegations is a question of evidence. The
question is not about veracity of the allegations, but whether
the respondents are answerable at all before the criminal court.
There is no indication in that regard in the order passed by the
learned Magistrate.”
54. The findings of the CBI have been mentioned-herein above in
detail to highlight that how detail scientific, meticulous and fair
investigation was carried out by the CBI for reaching to the
conclusion that it was not a case of homicide, but suicide. There
should    have been overwhelming material             and evidence     to
discard/ignore such a report before the learned Magistrate. At the cost
of repetition, it is mentioned here that there has been nothing before
the learned Magistrate to discard the reports submitted by the CBI.
55. In view of the aforesaid discussion, in absence of order of sanction
for prosecution of the petitioners for the offence in question, the order
of cognizance is bad in law and is liable to be set-aside. Even
otherwise, the impugned order, which would disclose non-application
of mind by the learned Magistrate and without there being any
overwhelming evidence and material to discard the closure reports
filed by the CBI under Section 173 (2) CrPC, summoning the
petitioners, who are retired/serving government officers to face trial
for such a serious offence under Section 302 read with Section 120-B
IPC, is preposterous and to some extent outrageous. The impugned
order is, therefore, set-aside.
56. Accordingly, all the petitions are allowed.
