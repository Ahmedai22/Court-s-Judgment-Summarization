Through:    Mr. Rahul Tyagi, ASC for State with
1.     Exemption allowed, subject to all just exceptions.
2.     Applications stand disposed of.
3.     This is a petition seeking setting aside of the impugned judgment
dated 19.11.2022 passed by learned Sessions Court in Crl. Rev. 23/2020 and
to restore the order dated 06.01.2020 passed by the learned ACMM.
4.     In the present case, the learned ACMM vide order dated 06.01.2020
on an application u/s 156(3) Cr.P.C. filed by the petitioner was pleased to
disregard the action taken report (“ATR”) and direct registration of the FIR.
5.     The said order was challenged by the respondents herein in a revision
petition before Additional Sessions Judge who firstly discussed the legal
Digitally Signed byAMIT W.P.(CRL) 209/2023                                                    Page 1 of 7
position and held that the revision petition is maintainable.
6.     Secondly, the learned Sessions Court was of the view that once the
action taken report opined that no cognizable offence is made out and the
matter is civil in nature, for the learned ACMM to disagree with the opinion
of the inquiry officer and order registration of FIR would require reasons.
7.     The Sessions Court was of the view that the order of 06.01.2020 was
devoid of reasons and hence the Sessions Court was pleased to set aside the
order dated 06.01.2020 and remand the matter to ACMM to hear afresh and
take a reasoned decision.
8.     This order of the Sessions Court has been challenged by the
petitioner.
9.     It is stated by Mr. Dwivedi, learned counsel that the order directing
registration of FIR is an interlocutory order and has relied upon judgment of
Gujarat High Court in “Parmar Rameshchandra Ganpatray & Ors. vs. State
of Gujarat & Ors.” in Spl. Criminal Appl. No. 5789/2016 and more
particularly para 45 and 50 which read as under:
“45. The moot question is if a revision application against
mere registration of F.I.R. by the police is not maintainable
whether such revision would be held maintainable when the
Magistrate only directs registration of FIR. In the opinion of
this Court, the answer is an emphatic No. Exercise of revisory
power conferred by the Court under Section 397 read with
Section 401 of the Code would occasion when there is an order
passed by the competent court, which is not interlocutory in
nature, however, the said power cannot be exercised to quash
the FIR or investigation because such power can be exercised
only by the High Court under Section 482 of the Code or under
Article 226/227 of the Constitution of India. If the revision
application is considered to be maintainable before the
Sessions Court against an order passed by the Magistrate
Digitally Signed byAMIT W.P.(CRL) 209/2023                                                   Page 2 of 7
under Section 156(3) and if such revision is allowed it would
have effect of quashing the FIR, therefore, if the Sessions Court
has no such powers otherwise, it cannot do so by entertaining a
revision against an order passed by the Magistrate under
Section 156(3) of the Code. [See: Amor Nath vs. State of
50. In view of the aforesaid discussion, I hold that the order
under Section 156(3) of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973
is an "interlocutory order" and the revision under Section 397
read with Section 401 of the Cr.P.C. would not lie. At the same
time, an order of the Magistrate rejecting an application under
Section 156(3) of the Code for the registration of a case by the
police and for investigation is not an "interlocutory order".
Such an order is amenable to the remedy of a criminal revision
under Sections 397 read with 401 of the Cr.P.C.”
10.    He also relied on the judgment of Allahabad High Court viz., “Father
Thomas vs. State of U.P. & Ors.” in CRL.REV. No. 1581/2001, 1640/2001,
1656/2001, 1658/2001, 1727/2001, 1731/2001 and more particularly para 46
and 54 which read as under:
“46. As the direction for investigation passed by the
Magistrate under Section 156(3) is purely interlocutory in
nature, and involves no substantial rights of the parties, we are
of the view that the bar under Section 397(2) Code of Criminal
Procedure to the entertainment of a criminal revision can also
not be circumvented by moving an application under Section
482 Code of Criminal Procedure. As observed in State v.
Navjot Sandhu, MANU/SC/0396/2003: (2003) 6 SCC 641, in
54. As on the basis of the aforesaid reasoning we have already
held the order under Section 156(3) Code of Criminal
Procedure not to be amenable to challenge in a criminal
revision or an application under Section 482 Code of Criminal
Procedure it is not necessary for this Court to go into the
further question whether the said order is administrative in
Digitally Signed byAMIT W.P.(CRL) 209/2023                                                   Page 3 of 7
nature as urged by Sri G.S. Chaturvedi and the learned
Government Advocate or judicial in nature as contended by Sri
D.S. Mishra and Sri Dileep Gupta. Following the decision of
the Apex Court in Asit Bhattacharjee v. Hanuman Prasad Ojha
and Ors., MANU/SC/7676/2007: (2007) 5 SCC 786, we are
also not inclined to express any opinion on this issue, and leave
the question open for decision in a subsequent proceeding
where an answer to this question may become necessary.”
11.    I am unable to agree with the two judgments.
12.    The Delhi High Court in “Nishu Wadhwa vs. Siddharth Wadhwa &
Anr.” in W.P.(CRL) 1253/2016 on 10.01.2017 observed as under:
“13. The issue that since the accused has not been
summoned as an accused and has no right to file a revision
petition is alien, while deciding an application under Section
156(3) Cr.P.C. The said issue crops up when the Magistrate
entertains the complaint and on taking cognizance proceeds
as a complaint case. In case directions are issued for
registration of FIR immediately, on registration of FIR, the
person against whom allegations are made in the FIR
attains the status of an accused. His rights in so far as the
Police can summon him for investigation, arrest him without
warrants for allegations of cognizable offences are duly
affected. In a situation where the fundamental right of
freedom and liberty of a person is affected, it cannot be held
that he has no right to be heard at that stage. Thus to hold
that since directions only have been issued under Section
156(3) Cr.P.C. and no cognizance has been taken thus no
revision would lie would be an erroneous reading of the
decisions of the Supreme Court. Therefore, an order
dismissing or allowing an application under Section 156
(3) Cr.P.C. is not an interlocutory order and a revision
petition against the same is maintainable.”
Digitally Signed byAMIT W.P.(CRL) 209/2023                                                   Page 4 of 7
13.     I am of the view that the registration of FIR affects the fundamental
right and freedom of the accused person. He can be summoned for
investigation, arrested without warrants for allegations of cognizable
offences. Therefore, an order directing registration of FIR u/s 156(3) Cr.P.C.
is not an interlocutory order and the revision petition against the same would
be maintainable as the accused has a valuable right to be heard.
14.    It is further stated by Mr. Dwivedi that only brief reasons are required
for registration of an FIR which was done, which has been given by the
learned MM.
15.    The operative portion of the order dated 06.01.2020 reads as under:
“Per contra, as per the ATR, it is denied that any cognizable
offence is made out. It is stated that the collaboration
agreement has not been fabricated as alleged and full & final
payment of Rs. 85,00,000/- is acknowledged by receipt dated
06.01.2013 and another undated receipt.
The complainant has denied his signature on the undated
receipt and fabricated pages of collaboration agreement. It is
conceded by the IO that verification of transfer of RS. 40. 00
Lacs through cheques to the account of the Complajnant per
the undated receipt was not verified.
In these facts and circumstances, this Court deems it
appropriate to order registration of FIR under relevant
Sections as commission of cognizable offences are made out
and complainant is not equipped to collect evidence by himself.
SHO concerned is directed to register the same and file
compliance report, within a week. He shall investigate/get the
matter investigated, as per law.”
16.    In “Harpal Singh Arora and Ors. vs. State and Anr.” 2008 (103) DRJ
282 this Court formulated the relevant question which reads as under:
Digitally Signed byAMIT W.P.(CRL) 209/2023                                                    Page 5 of 7
“(b) Is a Magistrate, when approached thereafter by a
complainant with a complaint under Section 190 read with
Section 200 CrPC along with an application under Section 156
(3) Cr.PC seeking a direction for investigation by the police,
bound to deal with the said report before disposing of the
application under Section 156 (3) CrPC and proceeding with
the complaint under Section 200 CrPC?
16. Considering the fact that the learned MM called for the
report of the CAW Cell, which is fairly detailed, the proper
course of action before ordering an investigation under Section
156 (3) would have been to examine that report before deciding
to issue a direction for investigation. When the police in the
CAW Cell has come to conclusion that no cognizable offence is
made out, the Magistrate cannot brush aside that conclusion
lightly. Although that the said conclusion of the CAW Cell is
not binding on the Magistrate at that stage, since his order is a
judicial one he must give reasons, however brief, why he is
inclined to order investigation notwithstanding the said report.
Question (b) is answered accordingly.”
17.     In „Arvindbhai Ravjibhai Patel vs. Dhirubhai Sambhubhai‟ 1998(1)
Crimes 351, the Gujarat High Court took exception to the growing tendency
of asking the police to investigate cases u/s 156(3) of the Code and advised
Magistrate not to pass orders mechanically. It was held:-
“Magistrates should act under Section 156 (3) of the Code only
in those cases where the assistance of the police is essentially
required and the Magistrate is of the considered view that the
complainant on his own may not be in a position to collect and
produce evidence in support of the accusation”.
18.    I am of the view that the ATR has not been considered by the learned
19.    The MM directed that “in these facts and circumstances this Court
Digitally Signed byAMIT W.P.(CRL) 209/2023                                                  Page 6 of 7
deems it appropriate to order registration of FIR…” This order is not
showing application of mind as to why and how the ATR has been
considered and the reasons as to why the learned MM has not agreed with
the opinion expressed by the IO that no cognizable offence has been made
out. This aspect has been correctly analysed by the learned Sessions Court in
its revisional jurisdiction.
20.    In this view of the matter, I find no merit in the petition and the same
is dismissed.
