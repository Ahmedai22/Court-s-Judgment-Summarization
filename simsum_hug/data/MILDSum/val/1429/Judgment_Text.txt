[2]     It is a case where the petitioner who was serving as Police
Sub-Inspector was proceeded departmentally on account of an
incident involving escape of under-trial prisoner from the custody.
The challenge to the impugned order is two fold, firstly on merits
where learned Senior Advocate Mr. G.M.Joshi appearing for the
petitioner has contended that there is no evidence of any
involvement of the petitioner in the escape of under-trial from the
custody as the petitioner was not found part of the escort/japta to
the hospital from where he made the escape. Secondly, other police
personnel who formed the escort group and were only responsible
when the under-trial prisoner was hospitalized were also proceeded,
but were inflicted with only punishments like withholding of
increment or penalty to the tune of Rs.5,000/- etc. whereas against
the petitioner, the effect of order is that of dismissal from service.
Therefore, it is argued that the case of the petitioner requires to be
reconsider even on the aspect of punishment.
[3]     Learned Senior Advocate for the petitioner in support of his
argument has taken this Court through the charges against the
petitioner and the inquiry report pursuant to the inquiry and
submitted that the only connecting factor of the petitioner that the
escape of the under-trial prisoner from the hospital is that the
petitioner was in contact on mobile with the under-trial prisoner, his
friend, treating doctor of under-trial prisoner and the jailer.
[3.1] It is submitted that the there are no proceedings initiated
against the jailer or the doctors who are also Government servants.
Moreover, the petitioner had given proper explanation or the reason
for which he was in contact with the doctor and the jailer. It is
submitted that such reasons were proper and genuine, the
authorities have not taken into consideration. Learned advocate has
relied    upon       the  decision  of   Anand     Regional         Coop.         Oil
Seedsgrowers’              Union     Limited        v/s.     Shaileshkumar
Harshadbhai            Shah,.   Reported      in (2006)    6   SCC        548       to
substantiate his argument that the institution has to maintain parity
in punishment and in the present case, the other delinquents of the
same incident have not been punished as severally as the petitioner
and therefore, on the ground of parity for punishment, at least the
case of the petitioner deserves consideration. Learned advocate in
this regard has also relied upon the decision in the case of
Nareshchandra Bhardwaj v/s. Bank of India and others,
reported in AIR 2019 SC 2075.
[4]     Learned      Assistant Government     Pleader   at    the       outset
submitted that the action on the part of the petitioner is of a grave
nature where on account of his dereliction of duty, the under-trial
prisoner had escaped from his custody. The petitioner was the
highest officer responsible for the escort party of the under-trial
while he was hospitalized. The authorities while considering the
case of the petitioner were able to establish that the petitioner had
played role even to the extent of creating a ground to see to it that
the under-trial is for some ingenuine reason shifted to the hospital
and from there he manages to escape from the custody and
therefore, it is the petitioner who had set up the background and
engineered the escape. It is submitted that the inquiry has been
conducted in due course and by applying the principles of natural
justice and following all the procedural laws and it is only thereafter,
by taking into consideration the nature of evidence on record that
the punishment is inflicted. It is submitted that the case of the
petitioner on the ground of parity cannot be taken into consideration
as the role of the other delinquents who were present when the
escape was made was only their presence whereas the case against
the petitioner that he had connived with the under-trial accused, his
friends and other Government servants to stage and escape of the
under-trial prisoner. Therefore, the role of the petitioner being much
graver, the petitioner has been held guilty and while inflicting the
punishment as the petitioner had retired, the Government was
within its rights to invoke Rule 24 of the Gujarat Civil Service
(Pension) Rules, 2002 and passed the order of withholding of 100%
[4.1] Learned Assistant Government Pleader has relied upon the
decision in the case of Union of India and others v/s. Dalbir
Singh, reported in (2021) 11 SCC 321 in support of the contention
that the interference by the High Court under Article 226 of the
Constitution of India is justified only if the disciplinary authority has
based its finding of “no evidence or in case of infraction of any rule
or regulations or the violation of principles of natural justice”. It is
submitted that in the instant case there is sufficient evidence and
therefore, no interference is required either on merits or on the
ground of parity of punishment.
[5]     Heard learned advocates for the parties and perused the
documents placed on record. It is a case where the petitioner was
issued with the charge-sheet, wherein Jigar @ Dholiya Satishbhai
Patel, resi. At–Thamna, under trial prisoner of the offence u/s. 302,
344, 364 of I.P.C. registered in Rural Police Station - Anand vide F.
C.R. no. 12/2008 was admitted for the treatment as an indoor
patient in Room no. 4 of Anand Municipality General Hospital under
the accused custody of 4 police men for the period from 08:00 hrs.
from     26/09/2012 to 08:00 hrs. On 27/09/2012. The said prisoner
Jigar @ Dholiyo Satishbhai Patel was the offender of serious offence
like double murder, had absconded from the legal custody of the
persons who were with him in surveillance at 19:30 hrs. Dt.
26/09/2012 and the petitioner has colluded the accused Jigar @
Dholiya Satishbhai Patel with the Doctor Mr. Arvind Jetha Dalvadi of
Municipal Hospital, Anand. The petitioner also has talked with the
accused and with the friend of accused from his mobile no.
9998188313 and has committed serious misconduct. The petitioner
has also made arrangements to give the tiffine from house to the
accused without the permission of Sub-Jailer and also abetted with
the accused, with the government Doctor and with the Jailer and
thereby, the petitioner has committed serious misconduct and
negligence in duty by abetting each other to escape the accused.
[6]     In the year 2012, an FIR being C.R.No.I-235 under Sections
223, 224, 225(a) and 114 of the IPC was registered with the Anand
Town Police Station wherein an under trial prisoner named Jigar @
Dholiya Satishbhai Patel arrested in Anand Rural I-C.R. No.12 of
2008 under Sections 302, 344 and 364 of IPC and was admitted in
Anand Municipality Hospital had fled away from the hospital,
wherein four police personnel were appointed from 26.09.2012 at
8:00 hours to 27.09.2012 till 8:00 hours at the hospital as Kaidi
Japta. In the meantime of this deployment of 4 personnel prisoner
Jigar @ Dholiya was escaped/fled.
[6.1] Charge-sheet dated 16.11.2013 was issued to the petitioner.
The petitioner replied to the said charge-sheet on 16.12.2013. After
receiving the reply by the petitioner, the departmental proceedings
was initiated against the petitioner on 10.01.2014 which was
completed on 09.10.2014. The petitioner in the meantime was
transferred to Surendrangar District on 19.10.2012 and from the
same place the petitioner was superannuated on 31.12.2013. The
office of the Superintendant        of Police, Anand had sent the
departmental inquiry report to the office of the Superintendent of
Police, Surendrangar. As the petitioner was superannuated from
Surendrangar on 31.12.2013 the departmental inquiry report was
forwarded to Home Department for final decision.
[6.2] The Home Department on 02.05.2015 issued show-cause
notice to the petitioner that why the pension or part thereof should
not    be     deducted. Before  passing     any  order     second         time
representation was made by the petitioner on 27.07.2015.
[6.3] From the record, it appears that four police persons who were
deployed at the hospital were also penalized/charge-sheeted by the
authorities. The names of the said four personnel are as under:-
[7]     From the inquiry report which contains the evidence in the
form of statement recorded during the inquiry by various witnesses
would go on to indicate that the petitioner was indeed in touch with
the friend of the under-trial prisoner during the proximate period. He
was also in contact on mobile which apparently was being used by
the under-trial himself and in the proximate period the petitioner
was in touch with the doctor as well as the jailer. Even if the
explanation offered by the petitioner with regard to his contact with
the doctor as well jailer may be accepted, but his mobile contact
with the friend of a under-trial prisoner as well as on the mobile
number allegedly used by the under-trial person himself was
sufficient for the authority to presume the role of the petitioner in
the entire incident more particularly when such Call Detail Record
was of proximate period of the incident of escape. The narration of
the gist of the oral evidence of the witnesses points a finger towards
the complexity of the petitioner. For this purpose, the Court has
referred to the gist of the statement given by one of the witnesses
Quarter, wherein he has categorically stated that the friend of the
under-trial prisoner was permitted at the behest of the petitioner to
enter into hospital where the under-trial prisoner was hospitalized
and has categorically stated that it was with the permission of the
present petitioner that he was allowed to enter. In the cross-
examination he has stood with his version given in the inquiry.
Similarly, statement of witness Pratapsinh Hemaji, Buckle No.641,
Anand Town Police Station, also substantiates the same clearly
indicating the role of the petitioner and therefore, in the opinion of
the Court, the authority was justified in accepting the inquiry report.
[8]     The argument made on behalf of learned advocate for the
petitioner regarding the presumption by the authorities only on the
basis of calls made inter-se between the accused, friends of the
accused and the jailer and doctor does not disclose the nature of
conversation or the subject of conversation and therefore, the
explanation offered by the petitioner ought to have been considered
in this regard. This Court is of the view that in service jurisprudence,
it is the preponderance of possibilities on the the basis of which the
authority is expected to arrive at conclusion. As held in the
preceding paras even if the explanation offered for the mobile
conversation with doctor and jailer is accepted, there is no denial
nor any explanation to the conversation of the petitioner with the
friends of the under-trial prisoner or on the mobile phone operated
by the under-trial prisoner himself.
[9]     In that view of the matter, it is not required for the authority
to search for the evidence which is in the nature to establish the
guilt beyond reasonable doubt, but in the facts of the present case,
the parameters of preponderance of possibilities is clearly achieved
on the basis of ocular evidence of the witnesses as well as
supporting documentary evidence. In that view of the matter also,
the Court is not inclined to interfere with the finding arrived at by
the authority against the petitioner.
[10] In so far as the procedural aspect of conducting the
departmental inquiry is concerned, there is no serious challenge to
it however, having gone through the record which includes the
charge-sheet imputation of charges, the inquiry report, final notice
and the replies filed by the petitioner from time to time which go on
to indicate that the principles of natural justice have not been
violated and there is no procedural lapse.
[11] In view of the aforesaid also, the Court is not inclined to
interfere with the decision of the authority in holding the petitioner
guilty of the charges.
[12]    The view of the Apex Court is supported by the decision of
the Apex Court      Union of India and others v/s. Dalbir Singh
(Supra) in para-28, which reads as under:-
“28. The burden of proof in the departmental proceedings is
not of beyond reasonable doubt as is the principle in the
criminal trial but probabilities of the misconduct. The
delinquent such as the writ petitioner could examine himself
to rebut the allegations of misconduct including use of
personal weapon. In fact, the reliance of the writ petitioner is
upon a communication dated 1.5.2014 made to the
Commandant through the inquiry officer. He has stated that
he has not fired on higher officers and that he was out of
camp at the alleged time of incident. Therefore, a false case
has been made against him. His further stand is that it was a
terrorist attack and terrorists have fired on the Camp. None
of the departmental witnesses have been even suggested
about any terrorist attack or that the writ petitioner was out
of camp. Constable D.K. Mishra had immobilized the writ
petitioner whereas all other witnesses have seen the writ
petitioner being immobilized and being removed to quarter
guard. PW-5 Brij Kishore Singh deposed that 3-4 soldiers had
taken the Self-Loading Rifle (S.L.R.) of the writ petitioner in
their possession. Therefore, the allegations in the
chargesheet dated 25.2.2013 that the writ petitioner has
fired from the official weapon is a reliable finding returned by
the Departmental Authorities on the basis of evidence placed
before them. It is not a case of no evidence, which alone
would warrant interference by the High Court in exercise of
power of judicial review. It is not the case of the writ
petitioner that there was any infraction of any rule or
regulations or the violation of the principles of natural justice.
The best available evidence had been produced by the
appellants in the course of enquiry conducted after long
lapse of time.”
[13]     Second aspect of the matter being the proportion of
punishment, whereby the impugned order 100% pension has been
deducted, the Court would like to refer to the decision in case of
(Supra), wherein the Supreme Court in paras-27 to 29 which held
“24. The Labour Court although has jurisdiction to consider
the question in regard to the quantum of punishment but it
had a limited role to play.
25. It is now well-settled that the industrial courts do not
interfere with the quantum of punishment unless there exists
sufficient reasons therefor. [See North Eastern Karnataka
R.T.Corpn. V. Ashappa, State of U.P. v. Sheo Shanker Lal
Srivastava, A. Sudhakar v. Post Master General , Mahindra
and Mahindra Ltd. v. N.B.Narawade, M.P. Electricity Board v.
and Another v. State of Karnataka and Bharat Petroleum
Corpn Ltd v. T.K. Raju).
26. A wrong test was applied herein by the Labour Court in
observing "If the nature of the offence is grave he could
have been inflicted punishment of stoppage of the
increments". On what premise the said observations were
made is not known.
“27. There is, however, another aspect of the matter which
cannot be lost sight of. Identical allegations were made
against seven persons. The Management did not take
serious note of misconduct committed by six others although
they were similarly situated. They were allowed to take the
benefit of the voluntary retirement scheme.”
[14]    It is a matter of record now that the respondent-State has
also proceeded against the other police personnel for the same
incident however, three constables i.e. Ghanshyambhai Popatbhai
was given charge-sheet and minor penalty were attracted as per the
Bombay Police (Discipline and Appeal), Rules 1956 wherein, his one
increment was stopped for six months by Superintendent of Police,
Anand, the second Lok-Rakshak namely Yogeshkumar Arvindbhai
was also given a charge-sheet under Bombay Police (Discipline and
Appeal) Rules, 1956 and he was also given minor penalty for fine of
one basic pay by Superintendent of Police, Patan and No.3 i.e. Lok-
Rakshak Virambhai Sarabhai was dismissed from the service by
Deputy Police Commissioner, Police Head Quarter, Surat City and
against which he preferred an appeal to Police Commissioner, Surat
City and dismissal was reduced to fine of Rs.5,000/-.
[15] Moreover, nothing has come on record about the action taken
by the State against the other erring person like jailor or the medical
officer qua whom also role is attributed in this incident.
[16] In this view of the matter, the Court deems it judicious to
consider the case of the petitioner on the ground of parity with other
delinquent. Hence, the punishment inflicted of 100% withdrawal of
the pension to be harsh punishment and hence, it is deemed fit to
modify the impugned order to the extent of punishment.
[17]     The Court has also considered the fact of the long tenure of
service period of the petitioner. During his career, nothing adverse
is brought on record and this being the sole incident, the entire
service record cannot be disregarded.
[18] In view of the aforesaid, the Court is of the opinion that the
impugned order be modified to read that the deduction of pension
be 25% instead of 100% which would commensurate with the
proved guilt. The petitioner is therefore, entitled to receive pension
to aforesaid extent. As the entitlement is decided by this order,
petitioner will not receive any interest on claim of arrears.
[19] With the aforesaid, the petition stands partly allowed. Rule
is made absolute to the aforesaid extent.
