Harij at Annexure-B to the present petition, in the
interest of justice.
C.      Pending admission, hearing and final disposal of
this petition, be pleased to stay the further
proceedings of the Criminal Case No.334 of 2017
below Exh.80 at Annexure-B to the present petition,
in the interest of justice.
D.      Your Lordships may be pleased to pass such other
order as may be deemed just and proper in the
circumstances of the case.”
2.     Short facts as can be gathered from the memo of
petition, stated as under :
2.1    That one criminal complaint being Criminal Case No.334
of 2017 filed before the learned Principal Civil Judge and
Judicial Magistrate First Class at Harij under the provision of
Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act against the
present petitioner.
2.2    After completion of recording of further statement under
Section 313 of the Cr.P.C., the petitioner submitted an
application        at Exh.80    dated       26.10.2021,   tendering            his
2.3    The learned Principal Civil Judge and Judicial Magistrate
First Class at Harij, vide its order dated 7.12.2021, dismissed
the said application below Exh.80.
3.     Feeling aggrieved by the aforesaid, the petitioner
approached the learned Sessions Judge, Patan by way of
Criminal Revision Application No.196 of 2021. The said
Criminal Revision Application, after having heard the parties,
the learned Sessions Judge, Patan has rejected by way of
judgment and order dated 24.3.2022.
4.     Feeling aggrieved by the aforesaid, the petitioner –
original accused has approached this Court by way of this
Special Criminal Application for the relief stated herein-above.
5.     I have heard Mr.Amit Joshi, learned counsel appearing
for the petitioner and Mr.Pranav Trivedi, learned Additional
Public Prosecutor for the respondent – State.
6.     Mr.Amit        Joshi,  learned counsel        for   the petitioner,
submitted that the courts below have committed serious error
in rejecting the application at Exh.80. He further submitted
that both the courts below have not properly appreciated the
provision of Section 145 of the Negotiable Instruments Act.
Learned counsel strongly relying upon the provision of
Section 315 of the Cr.P.C., contended that the accused is also
said to be competent witness and thus, the courts below ought
not to have rejected the application Exh.80. According to
Mr.Joshi,        both     the    courts        below   have       completely
misunderstood and misread the provision of Section 315 of
the Cr.P.C., by not allowing the petitioner to file examination-
6.1    Mr.Joshi, learned counsel, with a view to strengthen his
contentions, relied upon the judgment of the Coordinate
Bench of this Court in the case of Rakeshbhai Maganbhai
Barot v. State of Gujarat, reported in 2019 (4) GLR 2719.
6.2     By making above submissions, Mr.Joshi urged this Court
to allow the present petition.
7.      Per contra, Mr.Pranav Trivedi, learned Additional Public
Prosecutor for the respondent – State, vehemently opposed
the present petition, contending that the orders passed by the
courts below are perfectly justified and within the four
corners of law. Mr.Trivedi submitted that present application
appears to have been filed by the accused is with an intention
to derail the proceedings. He further submitted that normally,
the accused can give his evidence on oath as envisaged under
Section 243 of the Cr.P.C. However, if the accused wants to
be treated himself as a witness as envisaged under Section
315 of the Cr.P.C., in that event the accused has to specifically
file an application in writing seeking permission to be termed
as ‘witness’. Mr.Trivedi further submitted that in the instant
case, the petitioner has not filed any application seeking
permission treating him as an accused. Instead, straightaway,
he filed an application at Exh.80 requesting the trial court to
accept       the      examination-in-chief,    by  relying      upon         the
judgments          cited  by   the    Advocate    for   the     petitioner.
Mr.Trivedi, therefore, submitted that unless there is specific
permission is sought for and in turn, granted by the trial
court, accused cannot tender examination-in-chief, but can
give his evidence on oath under Section 243 of the Cr.P.C, as
7.1     By making above submissions, Mr.Trivedi urged this
Court to dismiss the present petition.
8.     I have heard the learned counsel appearing for the
respective parties and have gone through the material
produced        on    record in  detail.    No other    and        further
submissions have been canvassed by learned counsel for the
respective parties, except what are stated herein-above.
9.     Having heard the submissions of the learned advocates,
a short question that falls for consideration of this Court is
whether the order passed by the trial court as well as the
appellate court refusing to accept the examination-in-chief of
the accused, is justified?
10.    So as to consider the aforesaid question, it would be apt
to note relevant provision of Section 315 of the Cr.P.C., which
“315. Accused person to be competent witness:
(1) Any person accused of an offence before a Criminal
Court shall be a competent witness for the defence and
may give evidence on oath in disproof of the charges
made against him or any person charged together with
him at the same trial:
(a) he shall not be called as a witness except on his
own request in writing;
(b) his failure to give evidence shall not be made the
subject of any comment by any of the parties or the
Court or give rise to any presumption against himself or
any person charged together with him at the same trial.
(2) Any person against whom proceedings are
instituted in any Criminal Court under section 98, or
section 107, or section 108, or section 109, or section
110, or under Chapter IX or under Part B, Part C or
Part D of Chapter X, may offer himself as a witness in
such proceedings:
Provided that in proceedings under section 108,
section 109 or section 110, the failure of such person to
give evidence shall not be made the subject or any
comment by any of the parties or the Court or give rise
to any presumption against him or any other person
proceeded against together with him at the same
inquiry.”
11.    Bare perusal of the provision of Section 315 would
indicate that accused person can be competent witness,
provided there is a written permission or there is a written
request made to the concerned court at the instance of
accused. Thus, in view of the provision of Section 315 of the
Cr.P.C., accused person can be a competent witness, but
before that, accused is required to request in writing to the
12.    Keeping in mind the aforesaid legal provision as well as
the facts of the present case, it appears that in the instant
case, the petitioner has filed an application at Exh.80 dated
26.10.2021 before the concerned Magistrate, requesting to
accept his examination-in-chief. I have an occasion to go
through the certified copy of the original application at
Exh.80. It appears that the petitioner by relying upon the
judgment in the case of Rakeshbhai Maganbhai Barot
(supra), straightaway, sought to submit his examination-in-
chief. Admittedly, no written request made to the concerned
court as envisaged in Section 315 of the Cr.P.C. Keeping in
mind this peculiar and distinguishing fact and the mandate of
Section 315 of the Cr.P.C., in my considered opinion, both the
courts below have committed no mistake in not accepting the
examination-in-chief of the present petitioner.
13.    So far as the reliance place by learned counsel for the
petitioner in judgment of the Coordinate Bench of this Court
in the case of Rakeshbhai Maganbhai Barot                     (supra) is
concerned, in the said judgment, the Coordinate Bench has
noted the facts as under :
“2. It appears from the materials on record that the
respondent no.2 herein – original complainant filed a
private complaint in the Court of the Chief Judicial
Magistrate, Himmatnagar, against the applicant
herein for the offence punishable under Section 138
of the Negotiable Instruments Act. The complaint has
been registered as the Criminal Case No.3145 of
2014 and the same is pending as on date in the Court
of the Chief Judicial Magistrate, Himmatnagar. The
applicant – original accused preferred an application
Exh.128, which reads as under :
“1) The present matter is at the stage of evidence of
the accused.
2) The court has refused to accept the evidence of the
accused on oath, therefore, it is necessary to file the
present application.
3) This application is preferred relying upon the
judgment dated 21.04.2013 delivered in the case of
Banking Association V/s. Union of India, whereby all
the courts of the country are directed to follow the
instructions contained therein.
“The Apex Court appreciating the efforts of
Bombay and Kolkata High Courts for speedy
disposal of 138 cases, finally laid down the
following procedure to be observed by all
criminal courts in the country for speedy and
expeditious disposal of 138 cases. The essence of
these procedures can be summarized as follows:
“The Apex Court of the country has given
directions to make speedy disposal of the
complaints of Section-138 of the Negotiable
Instrument Act. The said directions are
mentioned at last in the judgment annexed
herewith. I request the Ld. Court to go through
the same. It is mentioned in the Para-5 that "Ld.
Courts should accept the evidences of the
witness on oath instead of recording it orally. Ld.
Court can direct the witnesses of the
complainant and accused to remain present for
cross - examination as and when the Ld. Court
calls for.”
4) The Hon'ble Supreme Court has passed this
judgment after considering the decision in the case of
Mandavi Cooperative Bank Ltd. v/s. Nimesh Thakore
and, therefore, the directions given in this judgment
should be followed by all the courts of the country.
5) Before disposing of the present application, the
court should take into consideration that, “not only
the courts should follow the laws, but they should
also follow the directions given by the Hon'ble Apex
In the aforesaid circumstances, by submitting this
application we, the accused, as well as our witnesses,
propose to give our evidence on affidavit by way of
examination-in-chief. Therefore, an appropriate order
be passed for giving evidence of the accused as well
as of the witnesses of the accused on affidavit by way
of examination-in-chief.”
14.    Having gone through the aforesaid facts, it is emerging
that in the said case, the accused preferred an application at
Exh.128 and wherein, written request appears to have been
made     for      submitting   evidence       on affidavit    by      way       of
examination-in-chief. However, in the instant case, no such
written request came to be made by the petitioner to the
concerned Magistrate and straightaway, moved an application
Exh.80, submitting examination-in-chief. In view of the
aforesaid, the facts of the present case and the facts of the
case relied upon by the petitioner are materially different and
thereby, the same are not applicable.
15.       In view of the aforesaid, the present petition is bereft of
any merits and thereby, requires to be dismissed and the
same is accordingly dismissed.
