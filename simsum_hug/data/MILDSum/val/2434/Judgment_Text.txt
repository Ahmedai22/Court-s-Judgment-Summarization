2.           This appeal has been filed against the judgment of
the High Court dated 01.09.2015 dismissing the Criminal
Revision           filed   by   the    appellant   challenging   his
conviction and sentence under Section 279, 337 and 338
The  appellant,  a   bus   driver,  while  driving  bus
No.KL7D 4770 caused an accident on 16.02.1995 in which
car driver of KL 10B 5634 was injured. The appellant
was charged with offence under Sections 279, 337 and
338 IPC. The learned Judicial First Class Magistrate
vide   his   judgment     dated     28.04.1999   convicted    the
accused under Section 279 IPC and 338 IPC and sentence
him  to   undergo   six   months    imprisonment   and   fine  of
Rs.500/-   was  imposed,     in   default   to  undergo    simple
imprisonment for one month under Section 337 IPC.
4.   An  appeal   was   filed    by   the appellant    which  was
dismissed   by the    learned Sessions      Judge by     judgment
dated 29.05.2003. Criminal Revision was filed in the
High   Court  challenging      the   judgment  of   the   learned
Sessions   Judge   which    Criminal    Revision   petition   has
been  dismissed    by   the   High   Court  vide   the   impugned
judgment dated 01.09.2015.
5.   This Court on 01.08.2016 issued notice only on the
question of sentence. Service of notice is complete but
no one has appeared for respondent.
6.  Learned Counsel for the appellant contends that the
appellant is sole bread earning member of a poor family
consisting   of   four  children     and    his   wife.  It  is
submitted that the appellant if sent to jail after more
than 21 years, will suffer irreparable injury.
7.  Learned   counsel    for    the   appellant     has  placed
reliance on judgment of this Court in A.P. Raju versus
State  of  Orissa,   1995   Supp.(2)   SCC    385  and  Prakash
Chandra Agnihotri versus State of M.P., (1990) Supp.
8.  We   have   considered    the   submissions     of  learned
counsel for the appellant and have perused the record.
9.  The   judgment   of  this    Court    in   Prakash  Chandra
Agnihotri (Supra) as relied by learned counsel for the
appellant does support his submissions. In the above
case, the accused was convicted and sentenced for six
months  under Section    304A. This      Court converted    the
sentence  of imprisonment      into fine     of Rs.500/-.   The
Court was of the view that it would be harsh to send
the  appellant  to   the    Jail   after  18 years  of the
occurrence. Following was observed in paragraph 1 of
“1. The Courts below have maintained the
conviction    of    the    appellant   under
Section 304-A Indian Penal Code. We have
gone through the judgments of courts
below and we find no infirmity therein.
We uphold the conviction. The occurrence
took place on February 18, 1972. The
appellant has throughout been on bail.
He has been sentenced to six months
rigorous imprisonment and a fine of
Rs.250. We are of the view that it would
be rather harsh to send the appellant to
jail after 18 years of the occurrence.
The ends of justice would be met if the
appellant is asked to pay a fine of
Rs.2000/-.    The      sentence    is   thus
converted to a fine of Rs.2000/-. On
realisation the amount shall be paid to
the family of the deceased girl. The
amount be deposited with the Trial Court
within two months from today and the
trial court shall disburse the same to
the parents of the girl and in absence
of the parents to the next of kin of the
girl. In default of the payment of fine
the appellant shall undergo imprisonment
for six months.”
10. The incident took place on 16.02.1995 i.e. more
than  26  years   ago.   It   appears   that appellant was
throughout    on    the   bail.    The    Trial    Court    after
marshalling the evidence has recorded the conviction
under   Section    279,    338   and    awarded    sentence    of
imprisonment of six months and further sentenced to pay
a fine of Rs.500/- under Section 337.
11. We do not find any error in conviction recorded by
the   Trial   Court.    The   conviction     of   appellant    is
affirmed,     however,     looking     to    the     facts    and
circumstances of the present case specially the fact
that 26 years have elapsed from the incident, we are
inclined   to   substitute    the   sentence    of   six   months
imprisonment under Section 279 and 338 into fine. Six
months   sentence    under  Section    279   and   338   IPC  are
substituted by fine of Rs.1000/- each whereas sentence
of fine under Section 337 IPC is maintained.
12. The accused may deposit the fine of Rs.1000+1000
i.e. Rs.2000/- within a period of one month in the
Trial  Court.    The  judgments   of   the   Courts   below   are
modified  to  the above   extent.   The   appeal  is  partly
allowed accordingly.
