deposed that he did not remember from whom the said
information was sent to Munna Purwa. All the aforesaid family
members came from Munna Purwa at 07:00 a.m.                 After

his village, on foot and reached Nighasan at about 09:00 a.m.
On the crossroad of Nighasan, he found a person named

In cross-examination, P.W.1 had deposed that he went from the
police station before the Inspector through bicycle. He went
alone to lodge the report and returned back from there alone. He
came home at about 12:00 O’clock. After one hour of reaching

corpse before him.
P.W.1 had further deposed in his cross-examination that eight
years ago, a countrymade pistol 12 bore was not recovered from
him. However, he went to jail in relation to a case pertaining to
the said pistol and that case is still going on. Before 11 years
ago, his father had lodged a case under Section 307 I.P.C.
against   Kamlesh      and    his son.    The   father  of  Ajay
(convict/appellant), namely, Kamlesh, was the forest guard in
his area and after that he became Forester therein. He denied the
suggestion that he and his father Kadhiley were caught by
Kamlesh while cutting wood in the forest. He also denied the
suggestion that after cutting wood, he supplied that to Nepal.
He also denied the suggestion that due to monitoring by
Kamlesh of his family, his business of wood was closed.
However, he himself stated that he went to the forest to cut
‘wasti’ (by which wood is collected).
P.W.1 had further deposed in his cross-examination that hand-

used to live in thatch adjacent to corridor and none else were
living there.  First of all, sound of screaming of his father
Kadhiley (deceased) came and after that sound of screaming of
his sister Maina Devi (P.W.2) came. Maina Devi (P.W.2) was
with his father.   When he reached there, he saw the three
accused (convicts/appellants) were assaulting his father. He saw
a sword in the hand of Sarafat (convict/appellant no.1) and he
did not see any weapon with the other accused. He saw Sarafat

father Kadhiley (deceased) brought small pieces of wood, then,
Noor Mohammad and Sarafat (convicts/appellants) caught them
(P.W.1 and his father Kadhiley). He denied the suggestion that
as   Noor    Mohammad        and   Sarafat (convicts/appellants)
restrained him (P.W.1) from bringing wood, hence he falsely
implicated them.
(16) P.W.2-Maina Devi, who is the sister of the informant P.W.1
Brahmadeen and daughter of the deceased Kadhiley, had
deposed in her examination-in-chief that hand-pump was

police reached at the place of occurrence, she was present near
the deadbody of her father (Kadhiley). The police did not

Kadhiley, had deposed in his examination-in-chief       that the
incident had occurred three years ago. His house is adjacent to
the house of Kadhiley (deceased). On the date of incident, he
was sleeping in his house. At about 02:00 a.m., on noise, he
woke up; came outside his house; and saw towards the house of
Brahmadeen (P.W.1) in the light of torch that Sarafat, Noor
Mohammad and Ajay (convicts/appellants), while using abusive
language, were dragging Kadhiley (deceased) and at the same
time, Maina Devi (P.W.1) ran to save Kadhiley (deceased).
Then, Sarafat, Noor Mohammad and Ajay (convicts/appellants)
hit on the neck of Kadhiley with a sword, as a consequence of
which, Kadhiley (deceased) died on the spot. Thereafter,
convicts/appellants, while threatening to kill, ran away. Tulsi
came there on alarm raised.
In cross-examination, P.W.3 had deposed that his house is on
the western side of the house of Kadhiley. He denied that he
reached on the spot when assailants fled away. He reached on
the spot when accused assaulted the deceased. He denied that
Brahmadeen (P.W.1) told the name of murderers to him. The

the incident, he was not sleeping in his house but he was awake;
his family members were sleeping; he returned from the field
after sprinkling medicine on wheat; and after taking food, he

lying on the back; Maina Devi and Pammi were crying on
clinging the deadbody of Kadhiley; and there were blood on
their cloths.
P.W.3 had further deposed that there was no light on the spot
but he had a torch. The police personnel did not see his torch
nor memo of his torch was prepared. Apart from him, he did not
see the torch of anyone. He further deposed that before this
case, Kadhiley (deceased) had lodged a case under Section 307
I.P.C. against the accused, in which he was a witness. He was
not aware whether the accused were acquitted or not in the said
case. In the said case, he had deposed before the Court that he
had not seen the incident. He further deposed that Kadhiley
(deceased) had lodged another case under Section 307 I.P.C.
against the accused, wherein he was also a witness. He further
deposed that from the place where the deadbody of Kadhiley
was lying, inner portion of the house of Kadhiley was visible
and a lamp was lighting inside the house of Kadhiley.
P.W.3 had further deposed that after cutting forest wood, he was
preparing ‘Jhabai’. Kamlesh (father of convict/appellant Ajay),
who was working as Forester, caught him once and asked him
not to cut the wood again and since then, he had stopped the
work of cutting wood.       He denied the suggestion that on
account of the aforesaid, he falsely deposed against the son of
Kamlesh, namely, Ajay. He also denied that the incident did not
occur before him.
P.W.3 had further deposed in his cross-examination that the
deceased Kadhiley was the elder brother of his father. At the
time of incident, Noor Mohammad and Sarafat (convicts/
appellants) were working as ‘Watch-man’ in the forest. When
he used to prepare ‘Jhabai’ after cutting the wood from forest
and sold that, his business was going on but when Noor
Mohammad and Sarafat (convicts/appellants) did strictness,
then, his business of preparing ‘Jhabai’ after cutting the wood
from forest was stopped. He denied the suggestion that on
account of the aforesaid, he falsely deposed against Noor
Mohammd and Sarafat (convicts/appellants). He also denied
that he had not seen any incident.
P.W.3 had also deposed in his cross-examination that Inspector
had recorded his statement. The Investigating Officer of the
case had recorded his statement after 1-1½ month from the
date of incident. When the ‘panchayatnama’ of the deadbody
was prepared, he was present but his statement was not
recorded    by    the   Inspector,  who    was     preparing the
‘panchayatnama’ of the deadbody. His statement was recorded
by another police personnel. The place where he was standing
at the time of incident, was shown by him to the Inspector.
(18) After completion of the prosecution evidence, statement of the
convicts/appellants under Section 313 Cr.P.C. was recorded in
which they have denied the entire prosecution case and had
stated that Sarafat and Noor Mohammad (convicts/appellants)
were the ‘Watchman’ in the Forest Department, whereas father
of Ajay (convict/appellant), namely, Kamlesh, was the Forester
in the Forest Department. The informant (P.W.1) and his family
members used to cut wood of forest stealthily, therefore, they
(convicts/appellants Sarafat, Noor Mohammad and father of
convict/appellant Ajay, namely, Kamlesh) restrained the
informant (P.W.1) and his family members from cutting the
wood in the forest and        due to this reason, the convicts/
appellants were falsely implicated in the instant case.
(19) The learned trial Court believed the evidence of Brahmadeen
(P.W.1), Maina Devi (P.W.2) and Gauri Shanker (P.W.3) and
found the appellants guilty for the offence punishable under
Section 302 read with Section 34 I.P.C. and, accordingly,
convicted and sentenced the appellants in the manner stated in
paragraph-2 here-in-above. The trial Court, however, acquitted
the appellants for the offences punishable under Sections 504,
506 (2) I.P.C. and Section 3(2)(v) of the S.C./S.T. Act.
(20) It is pertinent to mention that the State of U.P. has not preferred
any appeal under Section 378 (1) of the Code of Criminal
Procedure against the acquittal of the appellants under Sections
504, 506 (2) I.P.C. and Section 3 (2) (v) of the S.C./S.T. Act.
(21) As mentioned earlier, aggrieved by their conviction and
sentences, convicts/appellants Sarafat and Noor Mohammad
preferred Criminal Appeal No. 61 of 2010 before this Court and
convict/appellant Ajay also preferred another appeal i.e.
Criminal Appeal No. 120 of 2010.

Mishra, learned Counsel for the convicts/appellant Ajay in
Criminal Appeal No. 120 of 2010, Shri Nadeem Murtaza,
learned Counsel for the convicts/appellants Sarafat and Noor
Mohammad in Criminal Appeal No. 61 of 2010 and Smt. Smiti

respondent/State.
(23) Shri Abhishek Mishra, learned Counsel for the complainant did
not appear.
(24) Shri Nagendra Mohan assisted by Shri Anil Kumar Mishra,
learned Counsel for the convicts/appellant Ajay in Criminal
Appeal No. 120 of 2010 has argued as under :-
I.    The alleged incident was said to be occurred on
18/19.04.2004, at 02:00 a.m., whereas the F.I.R. of the
alleged incident was lodged on 19.04.2004 at 10 a.m. The
distance between the place of the incident and police
station Nighasan was 13 Kms.       Thus, there was an
unexplained delay of about eight hours in lodging the
FIR which indicates that the alleged eyewitnesses i.e.
P.W.1, P.W.2 and P.W.3 were not present at the scene of
II.   There was no motive on the part of the convicts/
appellants to commit the murder of the deceased
Kadhiley. However, motive for falsely implicating the
convicts/appellants was available on the part of the
informant (P.W.1) and his family members inasmuch as
informant (P.W.1) and his family members used to cut the
wood of forest by theft and the convicts/appellants
Sarafat, Noor Mohammad and father of convict/appellant
Ajay, namely, Kamlesh, being Watchman and Forester,
respectively, used to restrain the informant (P.W.1) and
his family members from cutting the wood from the
forest illegally.
III. P.W.1, P.W.2 and P.W.3, the alleged eyewitnesses, were
son, daughter and nephew of the deceased Kadhiley and
they were interested witnesses, hence testimonies of all
three eyewitnesses being interested testimony cannot be
IV.  Though at the time of incident, the prosecution had
alleged that the independent witnesses were also present
but none of the independent witness was produced by the
prosecution to prove the prosecution case.
V.   The alleged incident occurred on 18/19.04.2004, at 02:00
a.m. in a dark night and, hence identification of convicts/
appellants was not possible as there was no source of
light available. Prosecution story of ‘Dibbi’ (a kerosene
oil lamp), placed on ‘Kuthla’ (box made with soil) in the
thatch of the deceased Kudhiley burning and P.W.3 Gauri
Shanker armed with torch at the time of incident, is
incredible as during investigation also no alleged ‘Dibbi’
(a kerosene oil lamp) and no torch were seized by the
Investigating Officer and therefore, in absence of any
source of light, claim by the witnesses that they had
identified the convicts/appellants, was impossible and is
not creditworthy.
VI.   The evidence of PW-1, PW-2 and PW-3 indicates that
there was prior enmity between the deceased Kadhiley
and    convicts/appellants   because   of    which     false
implication cannot be ruled out;
VII. The investigation of the case was tainted as the blood
stained clothes were not seized by the Investigating
Officer at the time of panchayatnama. P.W.3-Gauri
Shanker had deposed in his cross-examination that when
he reached at the place of occurrence, Maina Devi
(P.W.2) and Pammi were crying by clinging the deadbody
of the deceased Kadhiley and stains of blood was present
on the cloths of Maina Devi (P.W.2) and Pammi. But the
Investigating Officer did not seize the clothes of Maina
Devi (P.W.2) and Pammi;
VIII. The prosecution story does not find any corroboration
from medical evidence. In the F.I.R., it was alleged that
all the three convicts/appellants murdered the deceased
Kadhiley by inflicting injuries with sword. All the alleged
three eye-witnesses had deposed before the trial Court
that at the time of incident, Sarafat (convict/appellant)
assaulted the deceased with sword, whereas other two
convicts, namely, Noor Mohammad and Ajay only caught
hold the legs and hands of the deceased Kadhiley.
However, injuries no. 5 and 6, are contusions, which
could be attributable by blunt object like lathi and danda
but the prosecution had denied the use of any blunt object
like lathi and danda in the alleged incident. Hence,
looking to the aforesaid contradictions, convicts/
appellants be granted benefit of doubt.
(25) Shri    Nadeem      Murtaza,    learned    Counsel      for   the
convicts/appellants in Criminal Appeal No. 61 of 2010 has
supported the aforesaid arguments and argued that he has
nothing to add further.
(26) Mrs. Smiti Sahai, learned Additional Government Advocate for
the respondent/State, on the other hand, has vehemently
opposed the aforesaid submissions of the learned Counsel for
the convicts/appellants and has argued as under :-
I.    The prosecution version stood proved beyond all
reasonable doubt on the basis of testimonies of witnesses
of facts i.e. P.W.1, P.W.2 and P.W.3 during the trial
proving the charge framed against the convicts/
appellants.
II.   The delay in lodging the FIR has been satisfactorily
explained by P.W.1 and P.W.2 in their respective
testimonies. Both these witnesses have categorically
stated that the incident was occurred on 18/19.04.2004, at
02:00 a.m. but on account of fear, informant (P.W.1) did
not go to the police station for lodging the report of the
incident and he went to the police station only in the
morning.
III. At the time of incident, there was sufficient light at the
place of incident to recognize the convicts/appellants as
P.W.1 and P.W.2 had deposed that at the time of incident,
‘Dibbi’ (a kerosene oil lamp) placed beneath thatch was
burning, whereas P.W.3 had deposed that he was having
torch at the time of incident.
IV.  The medical evidence on record fully corroborates the
ocular testimonies, and despite embellishments and
deviations, is not going to change the texture of
prosecution case.
V.   The recorded conviction of the convicts/appellants is
based upon cogent and clinching evidence and the
sentence of imprisonment for life awarded to them is also
supported by relevant considerations.
VI.  So far as minor contradictions in the statement of the
prosecution witnesses viz. P.W.1, P.W.2 and P.W.3 are
concerned, she argued that there is much gap in recording
the examination-in-chief and cross-examination of P.W.1,
P.W.2     and   P.W.3,     hence  possibility    of   minor
contradictions in their statements cannot be ruled out and
on that basis, the convicts/appellants cannot be granted
benefit of doubt as the prosecution has proved it’s case
beyond all reasonable doubts on the basis of evidence
available on record.
VII. Hence, the impugned order passed by learned trial Court
does not suffer from any illegality, infirmity or perversity
warranting any interference by the Court.
E.1. Delay in lodging the F.I.R.
(27) The first issue relates to the credibility of the F.I.R. Learned
counsel for the convicts/appellants has questioned its reliability
on the ground that there was unexplained delay of 8 hours in
lodging of the F.I.R. which has rendered the entire prosecution
liable to be rejected.
(28) It is pertinent to mention here that the issue whether
prosecution case is liable to be thrown out merely on the ground
of delay itself or not has been examined by the Apex Court in a
catena of decisions and this Court deem it apt to refer to some
of the authorities on the issue.
(29) In Ravinder Kumar and another Vs. State of Punjab : AIR
2001 SC 3576, the Apex Court has observed as under :-
"The attack on prosecution cases on the ground
of delay in lodging FIR has almost bogged down
as a stereotyped redundancy in criminal cases. It
is a recurring feature in most of the criminal cases
that there would be some delay in furnishing the
first information to the police. It has to be
remembered that law has not fixed any time for
lodging the FIR. Hence a delayed FIR is not
illegal. Of course a prompt and immediate lodging
of the FIR is the ideal as that would give the
prosecution a twin advantage. First is that it
affords commencement of the investigation
without any time lapse. Second is that it expels
the opportunity for any possible concoction of a
false version. Barring these two plus points for a
promptly lodged FIR the demerits of the delayed
FIR cannot operate as fatal to any prosecution
case. It cannot be overlooked that even a
promptly lodged FIR is not an unreserved
guarantee for the genuineness of the version
incorporated therein.
When there is criticism on the ground that FIR in
a case was delayed the court has to look at the
reason why there was such a delay. There can be
a variety of genuine causes for FIR lodgment to
get delayed. Rural people might be ignorant of
the need for informing the police of a crime
without any lapse of time. This kind of
unconversantness is not too uncommon among
urban people also. They might not immediately
think of going to the police station. Another
possibility is due to lack of adequate transport
facilities for the informers to reach the police
station. The third, which is a quite common
bearing, is that the kith and kin of the deceased
might take some appreciable time to regain a
certain level of tranquility of mind or sedativeness
of temper for moving to the police station for the
purpose of furnishing the requisite information.
Yet another cause is, the persons who are
supposed to give such information themselves
could be so physically impaired that the police
had to reach them on getting some nebulous
information about the incident.
We are not providing an exhausting catalogue of
instances which could cause delay in lodging the
FIR. Our effort is to try to point out that the stale
demand made in the criminal courts to treat the
FIR vitiated merely on the ground of delay in its
lodgment cannot be approved as a legal corollary.
In any case, where there is delay in making the
FIR the court is to look at the causes for it and if
such causes are not attributable to any effort to
concoct a version no consequence shall be
attached to the mere delay in lodging the FIR.
[Vide Zahoor vs. State of UP (1991 Suppl.(1)
SCC 372; Tara Singh vs. State of Punjab (1991
Suppl.(1) SCC 536); Jamna vs. State of UP (1994
(1) SCC 185). In Tara Singh (Supra) the Court
made the following observations:
"It is well settled that the delay in giving the FIR
by itself cannot be a ground to doubt the
prosecution case. Knowing the Indian conditions
as they are we cannot expect these villagers to
rush to the police station immediately after the
occurrence. Human nature as it is, the kith and
kin who have witnessed the occurrence cannot be
expected to act mechanically with all the
promptitude in giving the report to the police. At
times being grief-stricken because of the calamity
it may not immediately occur to them that they
should give a report. After all it is but natural in
these circumstances for them to take some time
to go to the police station for giving the report." "
(30) In State of Himanchal Pradesh Vs. Gian Chand : AIR
2001(1) SC 2075, the Apex Court has observed as under :-
"Delay in lodging the FIR cannot be used as a
ritualistic formula for doubting the prosecution
case and discarding the same solely on the
ground of delay in lodging the first information
report. Delay has the effect of putting the Court in
its guard to search if any explanation has been
offered for the delay, and if offered, whether it is
satisfactory or not. If the prosecution fails to
satisfactorily explain the delay and there is
possibility of embellishment in prosecution
version on account of such delay, the delay would
be fatal to the prosecution. However, if the delay
is explained to the satisfaction of the court, the
delay cannot by itself be a ground for disbelieving
and discarding the entire prosecution case."
(31) In view of the aforesaid dictum of the Apex Court, the legal
position which emerges out is that it is settled principle of
criminal jurisprudence that mere delay in lodging the FIR may
not prove fatal in all cases, but in the given circumstances of the
case delay in lodging the FIR can be one of the factors which
may corrode the credibility of the prosecution version but delay
in lodging the FIR cannot be a ground itself for throwing away
the entire prosecution version as given in the FIR and later
substantiated by the evidence, unless there are indications of
fabrication. The Court has further to seek explanation for delay
and check the truthfulness of the version to inquire and if the
court is satisfied then the case of prosecution cannot fall on this
ground alone.
(32) In the instant case, the incident was occurred in the intervening
night of 18/19.04.2004, at 02:00 a.m., whereas the F.I.R. of the
incident was lodged on 19.04.2004 at 10:00 a.m. by
Brahmadeen (P.W.1), the son of deceased. The distance
between the place of occurrence and the police station Nighasan
was 13 Kms. Thus, in order to ascertain whether the
prosecution has come up with any satisfactory explanation for
the delay in lodging the F.I.R., it would be useful to look into
the evidence of PW1 and PW2 in this regard.
(33) PW1, Brahmadeen, informant, in his examination-in-chief, had
deposed that on account of fear, he could not go to lodge the
report in the night. In his cross-examination, he had
categorically deposed that at the time of incident, his mother
Shakuntala, his brother Sunder Lal and his wife went to in-
law’s house of his brother Sunder Lal at Munna Purwa, which
is situated 3 Kms. away from his village, for attending the
marriage function of brother-in-law of his brother Sunder Lal.
In the morning at 06:00 a.m., he sent the information with
regard to the incident to his brother Sunder Lal, his wife and
mother Shakuntala, who, on receiving the information of the
incident, returned back to his village at about 07:00 a.m.
Thereafter, he proceeded to police station for lodging the report
of the incident at police station Nighasan on foot and reached
Nighasan at 09:00 a.m. On the crossroad of Nighasan, he found
a person named Ramesh and he narrated the incident to him.
Thereafter, the said Ramesh, after bringing a paper and pen
from the stationery shop, scribed the report on his dictation and
after that he affixed his thumb impression on that and
proceeded to lodge the report at Police Station Nighasan. He
categorically stated that half an hour was consumed in scribing
the report and after that he went to police station Nighasan,
wherein he sat at police station Nighasan at about half an hour.
He proved the written report (Ext. Ka.1).
(34) P.W.2-Smt. Maina Devi, in cross-examination, had deposed that
her brother (P.W.1) was going to lodge the report of the incident
in the night but he (P.W.1) returned back to home on seeing that
convicts/appellants was barricading the way in southern
direction of her house.
(35) Thus, from the relevant extracts of the statement of PW1 and
PW2, it transpires that although there was some delay in
lodging the F.I.R. but the same cannot be attributed to the
informant or can be said to be deliberate with the object of
implicating the convicts/appellants. The delay in lodging the
F.I.R., in our opinion, has been satisfactory explained by P.W.1
and P.W.2.
E.2  Evidence of ‘interested witnesses’
(36) The contention of the learned Counsel for the convicts/
appellants is that all the prosecution witnesses P.W.1, P.W.2 and
P.W.3 (so called eye-witnesses) are all related and interested
witnesses as they are son, daughter and nephew, respectively, to
the deceased Kadhiley, hence their evidence cannot be said to
be a trustworthy.
(37) To prove its case, the prosecution has relied upon the evidence
of three eye-witnesses viz. PW-1 Brahmadeen, PW-2 Maina
Devi and PW-3 Gauri Shanker. PW-1, who is the son of the
deceased, had deposed that on the day of incident i.e. in the
intervening night of 18/19.04.2004, at about 2:00 am, convicts/
appellants Sarafat, Noor Mohammad and Ajay, were drinking
water from the hand-pump installed in front of his house, upon
which his father Kadhiley (deceased) had made objection.
Thereafter, convicts/appellants used abusive language against
his father Kadhiley, to which his father Kadhiley asked
convicts/appellants not to use abusive language. After that
convicts/appellants brought his father Kadhiley towards road.
On seeing this, he (P.W.1) and his sister Maina Devi (P.W.2) ran
to save his father Kadhiley but convicts/appellants were
inflicting injuries on the neck of his father Kadhiley with
sword, as a consequence of which, his father Kadhiley died on
spot. On hue and cry, Gauri Shanker (P.W.3) and Tulsi were
also came there and they challenged the convicts/appellants.
After that, convicts/appellants, while threatening to kill them,
ran away towards southern direction. PW-1 also deposed that he
did not immediately went to the police station due to the fear of
the convicts/appellants and lodged his report on 19.04.2014 at
10:00 a.m. He also deposed that a case under Section 307 I.P.C.
was contested between the deceased Kadhiley and Kamlesh and
his son before 11 years ago. During the course of his cross-
examination, PW-1 was questioned in detail about the location
of the incident and the position of the deceased. He also
deposed that first of all, he heard the noise of his father
Kadhiley and after that he heard the noise of his sister Maina
Devi. At the time of the incident, Maina Devi (P.W.2) was with
his father Kadhiley. His house and thatch where his father
(deceased) and his sister (P.W.2) used to live, were joined with
a corridor. At the time of incident, he was at his house, which
was 5-6 steps away from the house where his father Kadhiley
and Maina Devi (P.W.2) were living. He denied the fact that he
had written in the report that all the three convicts/appellants
murdered his father by inflicting injuries on the neck of his
father with sword, but he deposed that when he reached at the
place of incident, he saw sword in the hands of Sarafat (convict/
appellant) and no weapon was seen by him in the hands of other
convicts/appellants. P.W.1 had also deposed that lamp was
burning inside the thatch of his father Kadhiley. P.W.2 – Maina
Devi specifically deposed about the proximity of her house
from the house of her brothers Brahmadeen (P.W.1) and Sunder
Lal. She denied that at the time of incident, she went to wake up
his brother Brahmadeen nor his brother Brahmadeen came her
house to wake up her. She furnished a cogent reason to be
present at the place of incident stating that she being daughter
of the deceased Kadhiley was sleeping on a cot inside the house
along with his sister Kanyawati. During his deposition, PW-2
specifically referred to the role and presence of the
convicts/appellant Sarafat being armed with sword and other
convicts/appellants caught hold the legs and hands of the
deceased Kadhiley. PW-3 Gauri Shanker, in similar terms,
deposed about the place where convicts/appellants inflicted
injuries on the person of the deceased. PW-3 stated that at the
time of    incident, he was sleeping in his house, which is
adjacent to the house of the deceased Kadhiley. On hearing the
noise of Maina Devi (P.W.2), he came outside his house and
saw in the light of his torch that while using abusive language,
Sarafat, Noor Mohammad and Ajay were pulling the deceased
Kadhiley and then Maina Devi (P.W.2) ran to save his father.
After that Sarafat, Noor Mohammad and Ajay hit with sword on
the neck of the deceased Kadhiley, as a consequence of which,
the deceased Kadhiley died instantaneously. Thereafter, the
convicts/ appellants, while threatening to kill them, fled away.
On screaming, Tulsi came.
(38) Having carefully considered the depositions of P.W.1, P.W.2
and P.W.3, there is no material inconsistency regarding the
nature or genesis of the incident. All the three witnesses have
deposed to (i) the presence of the deceased at the place of
incident; (ii) the presence of the convicts/appellants at the place
of occurrence; and (iii) convicts/appellants while using abusive
language pulled out the deceased and killed the deceased with
sword; as a result of which the deceased died instantaneously.
(39) It is well-settled in law that mere fact that relatives of the
deceased are the only witnesses is not sufficient to discredit
their cogent testimonies. The Apex Court in Mohd. Rojali v.
State of Assam : (2019) 19 SCC 567 reiterated the distinction
between “interested” and “related” witnesses and has held that
the mere fact that the witnesses are related to the deceased does
not impugn the credibility of their evidence if it is otherwise
credible and cogent. The relevant extract of the report is
reproduced as under :-
“13. As regards the contention that all the eye-
witnesses are close relatives of the deceased, it
is by now well settled that a related witness
cannot be said to be an ‘interested’ witness
merely by virtue of being a relative of the victim.
This Court has elucidated the difference between
‘interested’ and ‘related’ witnesses in a plethora of
cases, stating that a witness may be called
interested only when he or she derives some
benefit from the result of a litigation, which in the
context of a criminal case would mean that the
witness has a direct or indirect interest in seeing
the accused punished due to prior enmity or other
reasons, and thus has a motive to falsely
implicate the accused (for instance, see State of
Rajasthan v. Kalki, (1981) 2 SCC 752; Amit v.
State of Uttar Pradesh, (2012) 4 SCC 107; and
Gangabhavani v. Rayapati Venkat Reddy, (2013)
15 SCC298). Recently, this difference was
reiterated in Ganapathi v. State of Tamil Nadu,
(2018) 5 SCC 549, in the following terms, by
referring to the three-Judge bench decision
inState of Rajasthan v. Kalki (supra):
“interested” only when he or she derives
some benefit from the result of a litigation;
in the decree in a civil case, or in seeing an
accused person punished. A witness who is
a natural one and is the only possible eye
witness in the circumstances of a case
14. In criminal cases, it is often the case that the
offence is witnessed by a close relative of the
victim, whose presence on the scene of the
offence would be natural. The evidence of such a
witness cannot automatically be discarded by
labelling the witness as interested. Indeed, one of
the earliest statements with respect to interested
witnesses in criminal cases was made by this
Court in Dalip Singh v. State of Punjab, 1954
SCR 145, wherein this Court observed:
“26. A witness is normally to be considered
independent unless he or she springs from
sources which are likely to be tainted and
that usually means unless the witness has
cause, such as enmity against the accused,
to wish to implicate him falsely. Ordinarily, a
close relative would be the last to screen
the real culprit and falsely implicate an
15. In case of a related witness, the Court may
not treat his or her testimony as inherently
tainted, and needs to ensure only that the
evidence is inherently reliable, probable, cogent
and consistent. We may refer to the observations
of this Court in Jayabalan v. Union Territory of
“23. We are of the considered view that in
cases where the Court is called upon to
deal with the evidence of the interested
witnesses, the approach of the Court while
appreciating the evidence of such
witnesses must not be pedantic. The Court
must be cautious in appreciating and
interested witnesses but the Court must not
be suspicious of such evidence. The
primary endeavour of the Court must be to
look for consistency. The evidence of a
solely because it comes from the mouth of
a person who is closely related to the
(40) Keeping in mind the aforesaid dictum of the Apex Court and
also considering the testimonies of P.W.1, P.W.2 and P.W.3 as
well as on perusal of the impugned order, this Court find that
the evidence on the record has been carefully evaluated by the
trial Court. There is no basis to discredit the presence of the
three eye-witnesses i.e. P.W.1, P.W.2 and P.W.3 and nothing has
been elicited out in the course of the cross-examination to doubt
their presence. The nature of the injuries found to have been
sustained by the deceased is consistent with the account
furnished by the eye-witnesses.
E.3  Contradictions in the statements of the eye-witnesses P.W.1,
P.W.2 and P.W.3
(41) From examination of the statements made by the witnesses
PWs-1, 2 and 3, it would apt to mention here that it cannot be
said that the omissions/improvements in the version of the
witnesses makes their testimony untrustworthy due to
contradiction therein. As a matter of fact, from a close scrutiny
of the Case Diary, this Court find that the statements of the
witnesses had been recorded by the Investigating Officer in a
concised form by confining the same to the substance of the
statement, without going into every details and therefore, it is
possible that the minute details which the witnesses had
deposed before the Court were not recorded by the police in the
statement recorded under Section 161 Cr.P.C.
(42) Section 145 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872, lays down the
manner in which cross-examination of the witnesses is to be
made as to any previous statement made in writing. Section 145
of the Evidence Act is quoted herein below :-
"145. Cross-examination as to previous
statements in writing.--A witness may be cross-
examined as to previous statements made by him
in writing or reduced into writing, and relevant to
matters in question, without such writing being
shown to him, or being proved; but, if it is
intended to contradict him by the writing, his
attention must, before the writing can be proved,
be called to those parts of it which are to be used
for the purpose of contradicting him."
(43) In V. K. Mishra and another Vs. State of Uttarakhand and
another : (2015) 9 SCC 588, the Apex Court also had the
occasion    to   consider   the   correct  manner     of   proving
contradictions as to any previous statement made by a witness.
Upon interpretation of Section 145 of the Evidence Act, the
following observations have been made by the Apex Court in
paragraph 19 of the aforesaid decision, which are as follows :-
"19. Under Section 145 of the Evidence Act when
it is intended to contradict the witness by his
previous statement reduced into writing, the
attention of such witness must be called to those
parts of it which are to be used for the purpose of
contradicting him, before the writing can be used.
While recording the deposition of a witness, it
become the duty of the trial court to ensure that the
part of the police statement with which it is
intended to contradict the witness is brought to the
notice of the witness in his cross-examination. The
attention of witness is drawn to that part and this
must reflect in his cross-examination by
reproducing it. If the witness admits the part
intended to contradict him, it stands proved and
there is no need to further proof of contradiction
and it will be read while appreciating the evidence.
If he denies having made that part of the statement,
his attention must be drawn to that statement and
must be mentioned in the deposition. By this
process the contradiction is merely brought on
record, but it is yet to be proved. Thereafter when
investigating officer is examined in the court, his
attention should be drawn to the passage marked
for the purpose of contradiction, it will then be
proved in the deposition of the investigating officer
who again by referring to the police statement will
depose about the witness having made that
statement. The process again involves referring to
the police statement and culling out that part with
which the maker of the statement was intended to
be contradicted. If the witness was not confronted
with that part of the statement with which the
defence wanted to contradict him, then the court
cannot suo motu make use of statements to police
not proved in compliance with Section 145 of the
Evidence Act that is, by drawing attention to the
parts intended for contradiction."
(44) In the instant case, this Court finds that the Counsel for the
appellants had failed to invite the attention of the witnesses
PWs-1, 2 and 3 as to any previous statements in writing so as to
contradict the witnesses. On the contrary, an attempt has been
made to prove such contradictions.
(45) It is pertinent to mention here that from depositions of the
prosecution witnesses i.e. P.Ws. 1, 2 and 3, it transpires that the
examination-in-chief of P.W.1 was recorded by the trial Court
on 18.05.2005, whereas his cross-examinations was recorded
before the trial Court on five different dates i.e. on 24.05.2005,
02.09.2005, 18.11.2005, 12.06.2006 and 11.10.2006. The
examination-in-chief of P.W.2 was recorded before the trial
Court on 18.05.2005 and her cross-examination was recorded
before the trial Court on 11.10.2006. The examination-in-chief
of P.W.3 and some part of his cross-examination were recorded
before the trial Court on 04.11.2006, whereas some part of his
cross-examination was recorded on 11.12.2006. Thus, it clearly
shows that there were quite long gaps/intervals between
recording the examination-in-chief and cross-examination of
the eye-witnesses (P.Ws. 1, 2 and 3). Hence, it is quite possible
that contradictions as pointed out by the learned Counsel for the
appellants could be made on account of loss of memory. More
so, sense of observation differs from person to person.
(46) In Narayan Chetanram Chaudhary & Anr. v. State of
Maharashtra :(2000) 8 SCC 457, the Apex Court has
considered the minor contradictions in the testimony, while
appreciating the evidence in criminal trial and has held that
only contradictions in material particulars and not minor
contradictions can be a ground to discredit the testimony of the
witnesses. Relevant portion of Para 42 of the judgment reads as
“42. Only such omissions which amount to
contradiction in material particulars can be used
to discredit the testimony of the witness. The
omission in the police statement by itself would
not necessarily render the testimony of witness
unreliable. When the version given by the witness
in the court is different in material particulars from
that disclosed in his earlier statements, the case
of the prosecution becomes doubtful and not
otherwise. Minor contradictions are bound to
appear in the statements of truthful witnesses as
memory sometimes plays false and the sense of
observation differ from person to person. The
omissions in the earlier statement if found to be of
trivial details, as in the present case, the same
would not cause any dent in the testimony of PW
2. Even if there is contradiction of statement of a
witness on any material point, that is no ground to
reject the whole of the testimony of such
witness………...”
(47) Having regard to the ratio of law laid down in Narayan
Chetanram Chaudhary (supra) and V. K. Mishra (supra),
this Court is of the view that learned Counsel for the convicts/
appellants had failed to prove the contradictions in the
statements, made by the prosecution witnesses as per the
requirement of law and therefore, they could not be permitted to
avail the benefit of such alleged contradictions, if any, in the
testimony of the prosecution witnesses and further such
contradictions do not erode the credibility of the prosecution
witnesses since the basic facts stated by them before the police
do not contradict their earlier statements in such a manner so
that both their statements cannot co-exist. Moreover, this Court
finds that the version given by P.Ws-1, 2 and 3 broadly bears up
the same story without any vital contradictions and therefore,
their evidence is found to be trustworthy.
(48) Learned Counsel for the appellants/convicts has argued that
there is nothing on record which may attract or warrants the
commission of offence at deadly hours of night. According to
him, there was no motive on the part of the convicts/appellants
to commit the murder of the deceased Kadhiley.
(49) It transpires from perusal of the impugned judgment and order
dated 14.12.2009 that convicts/appellants themselves had
shown previous enmity with the informant by filing list Kha-8
as earlier also a report was made against the convicts/appellants
for the deadly attack on the informant by them. Paper No. Kha
8/2 filed before the trial Court related to the report of the
incident occurred on 13.05.1996, at 12 O’clock in the night
when accused Kamlesh, Ajai, Sarafat and Noor Mohammad
(convicts/appellants) armed with lathi, danda and countrymade
pistol had entered the house of the informant and with intention
to kill him fired upon the informant and also inflicted injuries
upon other family members of the informant with lathi and
danda. Paper No. Kha 8/4 filed before the trial Court related to
the report of the incident occurred on 23.05.1994 at mid night
when Kamlesh and other accused persons entered the house of
the informant and fired on the chest of the informant. Paper No.
Kha 9/2 filed before the trial Court is related to the judgment in
Case Crime No. 83 of 1994. The trial Court, after considering
the aforesaid documents, came to the conclusion that these
documents shows that before the incident, convicts/appellants
had entered into the house of the informant and fired upon him
with intention to kill him and further in the statement recorded
under Section 313 Cr.P.C., convicts/appellants themselves
admitted the fact that there was enmity with the informant. The
trial Court had also found that vide orders dated 31.08.2009 and
23.09.2009 passed in Sessions Trial No. 991 of 1997 : State Vs.
Sarafat, which was relating to the incident when the convicts/
appellants entered into the house of the informant and caused
injuries with intention to kill him, the trial Court had convicted
the convicts/appellants. In these backgrounds, the trial Court
had came to the conclusion that the prosecution had established
the motive to commit the murder of the deceased.
(50) On due consideration, this Court is of the view that the trial
Court has rightly came to the conclusion that there was motive
on the part of the convicts/appellants to commit the murder of
the deceased.
E.5. Non-examination of Independent Witness
(51) It has been contended by the learned Counsel for the appellants
that though at the time of incident, the prosecution had alleged
that the independent witnesses were also present but none of the
independent witness was produced by the prosecution to prove
the prosecution case.
(52) In Surinder Kumar v. State of Punjab : (2020) 2 SCC 563,
the Apex Court has observed that merely because prosecution
did not examine any independent witness, would not
necessarily lead to conclusion that accused was falsely
implicated.
(53) In Rizwan Khan v. State of Chhattisgarh : (2020) 9 SCC 627,
after referring to State of H.P. v. Pardeep Kumar (2018) 13
SCC 808, the Apex Court has observed that the examination of
independent witnesses is not an indispensable requirement and
such non-examination is not necessarily fatal to the prosecution
case.
(54)  In Gulam Sarbar v. State of Bihar : (2014) 3 SCC 401, the
Apex Court has held as under :-
"19. In the matter of appreciation of evidence of
witnesses, it is not the number of witnesses but
quality of their evidence which is important, as
there is no requirement under the Law of
Evidence that any particular number of witnesses
is to be examined to prove/disprove a fact. It is a
time-honoured principle that evidence must be
weighed and not counted. The test is whether the
evidence has a ring of truth, is cogent, credible
and trustworthy or otherwise.
The legal system has laid emphasis on value
provided by each witness, rather than the
multiplicity or plurality of witnesses. It is quality
and not quantity, which determines the adequacy
of evidence as has been provided by Section 134
of the Evidence Act. Even in probate cases,
where the law requires the examination of at least
one attesting witness, it has been held that
production of more witnesses does not carry any
weight.
Thus, conviction can even be based on the
testimony of a sole eyewitness, if the same
inspires confidence. (Vide Vadivelu Thevar v.
State of Madras [AIR 1957 SC 614: 1957 Cri LJ
1000] , Kunju v. State of T.N. [(2008) 2 SCC 151:
(2008) 1 SCC (Cri) 331] , Bipin Kumar Mondal v.
State of W.B. [(2010) 12 SCC 91: (2011) 2 SCC

SCC 10 : (2012) 1 SCC (Cri) 1] and Kishan
Chand v. State of Haryana [(2013) 2 SCC 502 :
(55) Applying the law laid down by the Apex Court in the aforesaid
decisions to the facts of the case on hand and when, as observed
by the trial Court, the prosecution witnesses have fully
supported the case of the prosecution, more particularly P.W.1,
P.W.2 and P.W.3 and they are found to be trustworthy and
reliable, non-examination of the independent witnesses is not
fatal to the case of the prosecution.
(56) Nothing is on record that Tulsi son of Tekan and other persons
as mentioned in the FIR reached the spot were mentioned as
witnesses in the chargesheet. In any case, P.W.1, P.W.2 and
P.W.3 have fully supported the case of the prosecution and,
therefore, non-examination of the aforesaid persons shall not be
fatal to the case of the prosecution.
(57) Learned Counsel for the appellant has contended that
availability of source of light has not been mentioned in the
written report submitted by the informant P.W.1. According to
him, though P.W.1 had stated before the trial Court that ‘Dibbi’
(a kerosene oil lamp) was lighting under chappar of the
deceased at the time of the incident, whereas P.W.2 had stated
that there was no source of light and P.W.3 claimed to see the
incident in the light of torch but during investigation, the
Investigating Officer had neither seized the alleged ‘Dibbi’ (a
kerosene oil lamp) nor seized the torch, hence in absence of any
source of light, claim of P.W.1, P.W.2 and P.W.3 that they had
identified the convicts/appellants was impossible and is not
trustworthy.
(58) In State of Uttar Pradesh v. Naresh and Ors. : (2011) 4 SCC
324, the Apex Court observed that it is settled legal proposition
that FIR is not an encyclopedia of the entire case. It may not
and need not contain all the details. Naming of the accused
therein may be important but not naming of an accused in FIR
may not be a ground to doubt the contents thereof in case the
statement of the witness is found to be trustworthy. The court
has to determine after examining the entire factual scenario
whether a person has participated in the crime or has been
falsely implicated. The informant fully acquainted with the
facts may lack necessary skill or ability to reproduce details of
the entire incident without anything missing from the same.
Some people may miss even the most important details in
narration.
(59) In view of the aforesaid dictum, this Court is of the view that
non-mentioning the availability of ‘Dibbi’ (a kerosene oil lamp)
and torch by the informant P.W.1 in the written report is not
fatal for the prosecution.
(60) So far as other contentions of the learned Counsel for the
appellant regarding absence of source of light on spot is
concerned, the evidence of P.W.1 shows that at the time of the
incident, ‘Dibbi’ (a kerosene oil lamp) was lighting under
chappar of the deceased Kadhiley. The evidence of P.W.2
shows that though she had stated that there was no source of
light at the time of the incident. P.W.3-Gauri Shanker had
stated before the trial Court that though he had not seen any
source of light on the spot but he was having a torch at the time
of the incident. P.W.3-Gauri Shanker had also stated that from
the place where the deadbody of the deceased was lying, the
inner portion of the house of the deceased was visible, where
‘Dibbi’ (a kerosene oil lamp) was burning.             All these
circumstances have established the fact that the prosecution
witnesses had pointed out the source of light in any manner on
spot at the time of the incident.
(61) So far as non-seizure of ‘Dibbi’ (a kerosene oil lamp) and torch
by the Investigating Officer is concerned, no doubt, the
Investigating Officer had committed mistake in not seizing the
‘Dibbi’ (a kerosene oil lamp) and torch under recovery memo
but the benefit of same cannot be permitted to be given to the
convicts/appellant, particularly when eye-witnesses of the
incident P.W.1, P.W.2 and P.W.3 had supported the prosecution
case beyond reasonable doubt.
(62) At this juncture, it would be apt to mention that in Nathuni
Yadav vs State of Bihar : (1998) 9 SCC 238, with regard to
identification in the dark, the Apex Court observed as under :-
"9.... Even assuming that there was no
possibility of some light reaching there
from the glow of stars, and the fact that
victims could have had enough visibility
to correctly identify the assailants. Over
and above those factors, we must bear
eyewitnesses being well acquainted with
the physiognomy of each one of the
assailants or that there was possibility
for making a wrong identification of
faces of the intruders standing in front of
them."
(63) In the instant case, from perusal of the testimonies of P.W.1,
P.W.2 and P.W.3, it transpires that there is evidence about the
availability of light near the place of occurrence. Even
otherwise there may not have been any source of light is hardly
considered relevant in view of the fact that the parties were
known to each other from earlier. The criminal jurisprudence
developed in this country recognizes that the eye sight capacity
of those who live in rural areas is far better than compared to
the town folks. Identification at night between known persons is
acknowledged to be possible by voice, silhouette, shadow, and
gait also. Therefore, this Court do not find much substance in
the submission of the convicts/ appellants that identification
was not possible in the night to give them the benefit of doubt.
(64) Learned Counsel for the convicts/appellants had contended that
in the F.I.R., it has been stated that all three convicts/appellants
armed with sword had murdered the deceased but P.W.1, P.W.2
and P.W.3 had deposed before the trial Court that at the time of
the incident, Sarafat (convict/appellant) assaulted the deceased
with sword, whereas other two convicts, namely, Noor
Mohammad and Ajay only caught hold the legs and hands of
the deceased Kadhiley. According to him, injuries no. 5 and 6
are contusions, which could be attributable by blunt object like
lathi and danda but the prosecution witnesses had denied the
use of any blunt object like lathi and danda in the alleged
incident, hence, the prosecution story does not find any
corroboration from medical evidence as the prosecution has
failed to explain the injuries no. 5 and 6 sustained by the
deceased Kadhiley.
(65) From the testimonies of P.W.1 and P.W.2 recorded before the
trial Court, it appears that Sarafat (convict/appellant) inflicted
the injuries with sword on the neck of the deceased Kadhiley,
whereas other two convicts/appelalnts, Noor Mohammad and
Ajay, were caught hold the legs and hands of the deceased
Kadhiley. P.W.1-Brahmadeeen, in his cross-examination, had
denied that he has mentioned in the F.I.R. that all three accused
(convicts/appellants) had murdered by inflicting injuries on the
neck of his father with sword. P.W.1 had also deposed that if
the aforesaid fact has been mentioned in the F.I.R., then, he
could not tell the reasons thereof. Thus, the trial Court has
rightly observed that the meaning of the prosecution could not
be that all the three accused (convicts/appellants) had sword
and all of them had inflicted injuries to the deceased with sword
but it means that the deceased was murdered by the accused, in
order to fulfill their common intention, with sword.
(66) It is true that the FIR is certainly the starting point of the
investigation, but it is well within the rights of the prosecution
to produce witness statements as they progress further into the
investigation and unearth the specific roles of accused persons.
The FIR as is known, only sets the investigative machinery, into
motion. Thus, the plea of the appellants in this regard has no
substance.
(67) P.W.6 Dr. J.P. Bhargava, who conducted the post-mortem of the
deceased Kadhiley, had found six ante-mortem injuries on the
person    of   the    deceased,   as  referred   in  paragraph-11
hereinabove, out of which, four were incised wounds and two
were contusions. P.W.6 Dr. J.P. Bhargava, in his cross-
examination, had deposed before the trial Court that the death
of the deceased could be caused on 18/19.04.2004 at 2:00 p.m.;
incised wounds on the person of the deceased could be
attributable by sharp edged weapons. In cross-examination,
P.W.6 had deposed that ante-mortem injuries of the deceased
could be attributable by two objects; (i) sharp edged weapon;
(ii) blunt object. P.W.6 had further deposed that injuries no.5
and 6 could be attributable if injured was hit by big stone or
injured was fallen on it. The evidence of P.W.1-Brahmadeen
and P.W.2-Maina Devi shows that convicts/appellants dragged
the deceased on the way; pushed him on the ground; and
assaulted him with sword. Considering the aforesaid, the trial
Court came to the conclusion that it is possible that during
dragging the deceased; pushing him on the ground; and
thereafter assaulted him, injuries no. 5 and 6 i.e. contusions
could be attributable to the deceased.
(68) Considering the facts and circumstances of the case, this Court
is of the view that it cannot be said that medical evidence does
not corroborate the testimonies of the prosecution witnesses.
Hence the submission of the learned Counsel for the appellant
has no substance in this regard.
(69) From the above analysis, this Court is of the view that the
prosecution has proved its case beyond reasonable doubt
against convicts/appellants and their conviction and sentence
for the murder of deceased Kadhiley in the intervening night of
18/19.4.2004 by the impugned judgment is fully justified.
(70) In view of the foregoing discussions, the conviction and
sentence of the appellants, Sarafat, Noor Mohammad and
Ajay, for the murder of deceased Kadhiley by means of the
impugned order dated 14.12.2009 does not call for any
interference by this Court.
Appellants Sarafat, Noor Mohammad and Ajay are in jail and
they shall serve out the sentence as ordered by the trial Court by
means of impugned order dated 14.12.2019.
(71) Both the above-captioned appeals stand dismissed.
(72) Let a copy of this judgment and the original record be
transmitted to the trial court concerned forthwith for
information and necessary compliance.
