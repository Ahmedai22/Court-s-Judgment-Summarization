This public interest litigation has been filed seeking
intervention of this Court in the matter of transfer of some
Elephants from State of Karnataka to respondent No.3
Trust which was reported in the media.        A direction has
been sought to the State Government to issue guidelines
directing that no person can sell or transfer or translocate
Elephants from the State of Karnataka to the respondent
No.3 Trust.    A direction has been sought to respondent
No.3 Trust to send back the 4 Elephants that were
transported to the said Trust and also send back all the
Elephants which have been taken by the Trust, back to the
respective Forest Department of the States from which
these Elephants were obtained.
2.    Notice for respondent No.1 has been accepted
by   learned   Additional  Government   Advocate,     whereas
Dr. Sujay N. Kantawala has put in appearance on behalf of
respondent No.3. With the consent of learned counsel for
the parties, we propose to dispose of the writ petition at the
admission stage without calling for counter affidavit /
statement of objections.
3.    The case of the petitioner in brief is that the
Elephants cannot be entrusted with private individuals or
organizations   and   must   be  reclaimed   by   the    State
Government. His case is that by allowing organizations like
the respondent No.3 to give refuge to Elephants, the State
Governments or the Central Government is abdicating its
responsibility. A perusal of documents annexed to the writ
petition indicates that 4 Elephants were rescued from a
Circus couple of decades ago.      The Court, acting on a
petition filed by animal rights activists, had directed the
Forest Department to take over the Elephants.        After the
Court order, the Mysore Royal Family volunteered to take
care of the Elephants and they were accordingly sent to the
Mysore Palace. The Elephants were a tourist attraction at
the Palace and were used for Elephant Safaris. The Forest
officials has informed that in 2017, the Royal Family wrote
to the Forest Department that the handlers were not taking
proper care of the animals. However, the animals were not
shifted due to administrative issues.     These 4 Elephants
have been given to respondent No.3 Trust by way of Gift
Deeds for their better care. The permission was given by
the Forest Department for transportation / translocation of
these animals.
4.    Learned    counsel   for   the   petitioner   has
contended that respondent No.1 should not allow the
transfer   of   Elephants  from   Karnataka.      The    forest
authorities had wrongly granted permit in favour             of
respondent No.3 to transfer the Elephants from Karnataka
to Jamnagar, Gujarat.       It is also contended that the
preference is being given to respondent No.3 in getting the
wild animals on extraneous considerations. It is submitted
that the animals which are transferred or translocated shall
be sterilized. The counsel for the petitioner has argued that
there is a strong apprehension that these animals would be
put to commercial use and the respondent No.3 may
misuse these animals by opening a breeding centre.
5.     The respondent No.3 has vehemently opposed
the petition. We have perused the counter affidavit. The
preliminary objections regarding maintainability of the writ
petition has been raised, which are as under:
i.     The instant writ petition is not maintainable either in
law or on facts and hence the petition to be dismissed at
the outset.
ii.    The Respondent No.3 is a separate, distinct and
independent organization in the form of a Public Trust and
has no legal association with Reliance Industries Limited as
is confused in many news reports attached with the
iii.   The Petitioner has suppressed material facts and
made false statements in this writ petition and averments
contained in the instant writ are clearly aimed at misleading
this Hon'ble Court and therefore the Petitioner is not
entitled to any relief ads claimed in this writ petition.
iv.    It is submitted that instant writ petition is clearly an
abuse of process of this Hon'ble Court and hence the Writ
Petition is to be dismissed at the very outset.
6.    Learned counsel for respondent No.3 submits
that the Respondent No.3 began as an informal associated
of like-minded persons who have immense passion and a
deep sense of attachment to the well-being of Elephants
and large mammals, especially those who were and are
victims of circumstances (injured in train accidents, fell in
water tunnels etc.) from the wild and victims of abuse in
captivity (circus, street begging etc). Though there is no
specific date from which its activities of helping Elephants
began, the first few efforts taken for the welfare of
Elephants began from 2013-2014. The Respondent No.3
began to provide shelter to rescued, diseased, old aged
Elephants from around 2014.
7.    The   Respondent    No.3  Trust   was   formally
registered as a Public Charitable Trust under the Gujarat
Public Trust Act, 1950 on 30th September 2019. The objects
for which the Trust is formed is to promote welfare of
animals and to establish buildings, maintain shelters and
provide state of the art facilities for animals who are
rescued, hurt, ill, of advanced age, victims of human -
animal conflict, victims of human abuse or compulsions or
are abandoned.
8.      The Respondent No.3 both before and after its
incorporation has been tirelessly working for the cause of
Elephants. The Respondent No.3 has established a very
large facility in the green belts alongside Jamnagar Refinery
along with use of over 50 acres of land for large shelters,
ponds, grazing areas, playing areas, eating areas, hospital
and care Camps, for Elephants. The Respondent No.3 also
received a formal permission from the Principal Chief
Conservator of Forest (Wildlife) and Chief Wildlife Warden,
Gujarat on 9th July 2020 for the Elephant Care Camp at
9.      Since   the   beginning   and   until now,   the
Respondent No.3 has:
a.      Created state of the art shelters and enclosures
for Elephants up to the capacity of 300 with potential
to increase the intake capacity depending on the fact
if the Respondent No.3 is called upon to rehabilitate
and/or rescue more Elephants.
b.      Received    up  to  153   sick, abandoned    and
victimized Elephants from past owners, possessors,
mahouts, handlers, circuses or rescued or from State
Government and other agencies.
c.      Employed 237 Mahouts, 8 veterinarians, 8
para-veterinarians and further 22 care takes and
trained staff members for the round the clock care
and attention of the Elephants.
d.      Established a supply chain of diet appropriate
foods and medicines for the Elephants.
e.      Established a State of the Art Elephant Hospital
equipped with a first of a kind restraining device for
treatment of Elephants, endoscopy machine, surgery
facility, hydraulic crane and cataract surgery facilities.
f.      Established   an   exercise   and   rejuvenation
regime for all the Elephants by using technology and
created a software that ensures Elephants have
adequate exercise.
g.      Established walking and grazing tracks for the
h.      Established   ponds  and    hydrotherapy   water
bodies for the Elephants.
j.      Employed    mahouts   of   a  large  number     of
Elephants who were working as mahouts prior to the
Elephant's rescue so as to rehabilitate mahouts as
well.
10.     Respondent No.3 has taken all steps without
any compromises to ensure the wellbeing of each and every
Elephant which has been sent to its Camp. It is a matter of
satisfaction that all of the said 153 Elephants as on date
have been treated and kept in the most appropriate and
conducive conditions which is evident from the fact that
large number of Elephants have integrated and formed
themselves into herds and are enjoying a peaceful retired
11.    The Respondent No.3 facilities are open to all
Elephants. The Respondent No.3 is a no-profit organization.
The Respondent No.3 does not intend to convert the Camp
into any sort of zoo or carry out any commercial activity
12.    It is contended that there is no prohibition or
restriction on the respondent No.3 carrying out the non-
profit activity of taking care of the rescued Elephants. It is
also contended that the respondent No.3 is not involved in
any commercial activity with these animals and they have
been kept only for rehabilitation and proper care. It is also
contended that respondent No.3 is not having any breeding
centres for these animals.      The respondent No.3 is only
concerned with the care and rehabilitation of Elephants and
other animals.     The Elephants who form themselves into
herds in a natural course of their nature and behavior may
intend to breed.    However, the respondent No.3 does not
use any artificial means of breeding of the animals.
13.   The counsel for respondent No.3 vehemently
submits that the writ petition has been filed with ulterior
motive and malafide intentions to malign the respondent
No.3 which is involved in pious work of animal care due to
animal love and affection and its Trustees.
14.   We have considered the submissions made by
the learned counsel for the petitioner as well as learned
counsel for respondent Nos.1 and 3.
15.   We have also perused the Wild Life (Protection)
Maximus stands at Sr. No.12B of Schedule I of the said Act.
Section 40 of the said Act deals with Declarations to be
made by persons in possession of animals or animal article.
The portion of Section 40 relevant to us reads as under:
“(2) No person shall, after the commencement
of this Act, acquire, receive, keep in his
control, custody or possession, sell, offer for
sale or 420 otherwise transfer or transport any
animal specified in Schedule I or Part ll of
Schedule II or any uncured trophy or meat
derived from such animal, or the salted or
dried skins of such animal or the musk of a
musk deer or the horn of a rhinoceros, except
with the previous permission in writing of the
Chief Wild Life Warden or the authorised
officer.
[(2A) No person other than a person having a
certificate of ownership, shall, after the
commencement of the Wild Life (Protection)
Amendment Act, 2002 (16 of 2003) acquire,
receive, keep in his control, custody or
possession any captive animal, animal article,
trophy or uncured trophy specified in Schedule
I or Part Il of Schedule II, except by way of
inheritance.]
[(2B) Every person inheriting any captive
animal, animal article, trophy or uncured
trophy under sub-section (2A) shall, within
ninety days of such inheritance make a
declaration to the Chief Wild Life Warden or
the authorised officer and the provisions of
sections 41 and 42 shall apply as if the
declaration had been made under sub-section
(1) of section 40:
Provided that nothing in sub-sections (2A) and
(2B) shall apply to the live elephant.]”
16.    Thus while no person other than one having a
certificate of ownership can acquire, receive or keep any
animal from Schedule I in his possession as per Section
40(2A), the proviso in the Section carves out exception in
case of live Elephants. This permits private individuals to
have ownership over live Elephants. Next Section 43 states
that no person having in his possession any captive animal
shall transfer the animal by way of sale or transaction of a
commercial nature.
17.   The   case   of  the   Petitioner that the  1st
Respondent should not have allowed transfer of the 4
Elephants from Karnataka is based on an article from a
news paper website. The article when read itself shows that
the four female Elephants mentioned therein belonged to a
private family. We find from the article itself that the
private family had first acquired the Elephant in pursuance
of their offer to take care of them as they were then circus
Elephants. Since the handlers were unable to look after
them they were sought to be returned. The Respondent
No.3 appears to have given them refuge. We do not find
any transaction of a commercial nature in this. Even
otherwise it is not the case of the Petitioner that the
transaction was of a commercial nature.
18.   In such cases where the Elephants are or were
private owned, the question of involvement of Forest
Authorities in minimal and limited only to the extent of
granting a transfer permit in accordance with Rule 125-e of
the Central Motor Vehicle Rules. We therefore find nothing
wrong     with  the   relocation    of the Elephants  to the
Respondent No.3. We also do not see anything wrong in
other instances of transfers private Elephants which are
loosely stated in the Petition. In fact the only aspect
relevant for relocation of an Elephant which is privately
owned is the consent of the person in whose possession the
Elephant is, such consent having been given without any
element of commercial transaction. Once such consent is
given it is incumbent on authorities to grant transfer
permits in accordance with law.
19.   The Petitioner's case about preference being
given to Respondent No.3 Trust and its capability required
attention. We have gone through the Counter and the
presentation submitted across the Bar. We have also
perused photographs of the Elephants themselves and the
facilities of the Respondent No.3 Trust. We are satisfied
that the Respondent No.3 is a bonafide Trust which is
carrying out a laudable object. To satisfy our conscience,
we intend to bind the Respondent No.3 to its statements
made in the Counter and also across the Bar and give
directions in this regard at the end of our judgment.
20.    The Petitioner has alleged preference being
given to the Respondent No.3 Trust. We find that the said
allegation is without any data or basis. In so far private
Elephants are concerned, we have already expressed our
view as above. In so far as Elephants which are possession
of the Central or State Government is concerned, we find
that there is no bar in the forest or wildlife authorities of
the Central or State Governments in relocating Elephants as
per their choice. This is for the reason that the bar of
Section 43 of the said Act applies only to private persons.
Also, the decision to relocate Elephants would be purely a
policy decision affecting no rights of any party. We are
fortified in holding so by a judgment of this Court in Writ
Petition No.18442-443 of 2012 decided on 13th March 2013
in which it was held as under:
“4. During the course of submission, the
petitioner's counsel has placed reliance on
Section 43 of the Wild Life (Protection) Act,
1972 which deals with regulation and transfer
of animals. We have perused the said section.
It states that no captive animal in respect of
which a person has certificate of ownership can
transfer by way of sale or offer for sole or by
any other mode of consideration of commercial
nature. Sub-section (2) of the said provision
also states that where a person transfers or
transports from the State in which he resides
to another State or acquires by transfer from
outside the State, any such animal in respect
of which he has a certificate of ownership, then
he must intimate to the Chief Wild Life Warden
or the authorized officer within whose
jurisdiction the transfer or transport is
effected. The said section, in our view, deals
with the transfer of captive animal by the
owner or a private person. Section 2(24) of the
above Act defines a ‘person' to include a 'firm'.
The expression 'person' cannot encompass
within its meaning a ‘State Government.'
5. In the instant case, the State Government in
its wisdom has taken a policy decision for the
translocation of the Elephants having regard to
the expenditure to be incurred in maintaining
the said Elephants and other considerations.
These are matters within the realm of the
State Government. This Court, in exercise of
its jurisdiction under Article 226 of the
Constitution cannot sit in judgment over the
decision of the State Government to
translocate the Elephants concerned.”
21.    The Petitioner's case that restrictions must be
brought in to prevent sterilization of Elephants is a
contention that only requires to be stated to be rejected.
The Hon’ble Apex Court in Shanti Prasad Nayak vs. Union of
India1 in which the following observations were made:
“18. At this juncture, we are obliged to take
note of the submission made by Mr. Tapesh
Kumar Singh, learned counsel appearing for
State of Jharkhand that State of West Bengal
has decided to take a regressive step by
introducing    contraceptives    so   that    the
Elephants do not procreate and consequently
the accidents of the present nature are
avoided. If it is so, it is absolutely
impermissible and also condemnable. Mr. Avijit
Bhattacharjee, learned counsel appearing for
the State of West Bengal shall take instructions
in this regard and file an affidavit of the
competent authority. However, as advised at
present, we restrain the authorities of the
State of West Bengal from taking any steps to
administer any kind of contraceptives or
introducing any method of sterilization which
hinders natural procreative process of the
Elephants or any wildlife.”
22.   In view of the above words of the Hon’ble Apex
Court, we find that the last request of the Petitioner is
condemnable to say the least. In this regard, we record the
submission of the Respondent No.3 Trust that it does not
promote breeding and it does not intend to be a breeding
centre. However we intend to bind the Respondent No.3
with the added responsibility that in cases where Elephants
at their facility by natural procreative process produce any
calves, the Respondent No.3 shall report the same to the
local authorities within 48 hours and the Respondent No.3
shall give an undertaking to the local authorities that they
shall provide for and take care of the said calves.
23.   The Petitioner's case regarding execution of gift
deeds without ascertaining source etc. is a frivolous
argument with no material facts pleaded. The Respondent
No.3 is a public trust of which according to us the Elephants
are beneficiaries. The relationship between them is of
trustee and beneficiary.
24.  In view of what we have held above, we do not
see the need of formal documentation for a privately owned
Elephant, especially which is in need of rescue or adoption.
In fact the law does not require any documentation.
According to us, any document with any nomenclature is
sufficient as long as it shows consent and absence of
commercial transaction.
25.  We see no reason whatsoever as to why the
153 Elephants, which we would like to refer as adoptee
Elephants, in custody and care of Respondent No.3 should
be disturbed by anyone especially since they are getting
good care, good facilities and seem integrated and well
26.  As stated by us above, in order to satisfy our
conscience, we wish to give following directions to the
Respondent No.3. The Learned Counsel for Respondent
No.3 has agreed and undertaken on behalf of Respondent
No.3 to abide by these directions:
(i)     The Elephants that are in the custody and care
of the Respondent No.3 Trust, shall till the end of
their respective lives, be continued to be given the
same care and facilities as specified in the Counter
filed in these proceedings.
(ii)    In case any more Elephants are relocated to the
Respondent No.3’s facility by private individuals,
organizations, Central or any State Governments or
their departments and agencies, the same care and
facilities as specified in the Counter filed in these
proceedings shall be provided to them for the rest of
their respective lives.
(iii)   The Respondent No.3 shall not enter into any
commercial transaction referred to in Section 43 of
the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972.
(iv)    The Respondent No.3 shall before receiving any
further Elephants, ensure that the same infrastructure
as present is available and sufficient for the new
adoptee Elephants.
(v)     The Respondent No.3 shall not use its facilities
for any commercial purpose.
(vi)    The   Respondent      No.3 shall not   promote
breeding by use of any scientific methods. However
only if as a result of natural procreative process any
calves are born, the Respondent No.3 shall report the
same,    to   the  local    forest   authorities  in whose
jurisdiction they are situate, within 48 hours and the
Respondent No.3 shall give an undertaking to the
local forest authorities that the Respondent No.3 shall
provide for and take care of the said calves.
(vii) The Respondent No.3 shall submit an annual
report of its activities and facilities for the Elephants
under its care to the local forest authorities in whose
jurisdiction they are situated.
27.    With    the  aforesaid      directions,   we  hereby
dispose of the writ petition.
