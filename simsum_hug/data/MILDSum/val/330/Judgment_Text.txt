1.    The matter is taken up through hybrid mode.
2.    Heard Mr. K. Panigrahi, learned counsel for the claimant –
Appellants and Mr. J. Mishra, learned counsel for insurer –
3.      Present appeal by the claimants is directed against impugned
judgment dated 17th February, 2012 of learned Commissioner for
Employee’s Compensation, Berhampur, Ganjam passed in W.C. Case
No.50 of 2001, wherein compensation to the tune of Rs.1,22,310/- has
been granted on account of death of deceased Purushottam Sethi
arising out of and in course of his employment as coolie in the truck
bearing registration number OR 16 2078.
4.      The Commissioner has directed the owner to pay the
compensation amount by exempting the insurer from the liability.
This is challenged by the claimants. Mr. Panigrahi, learned counsel
for the claimants submits that when the validity of the insurance
policy is not disputed and the cover note was issued on 25th January,
2000 at 2 pm, the insurance company cannot wash its hands from the
5.      The sole dispute remains in the present appeal that, as to from
which date and time the insurance coverage would be treated effective
in respect of the vehicle in question. As per the cover note produced
on record (Cover Note No.706757), it has been issued on 25th January,
2000 at 2 pm and the accident took place on 25th January, 2000 at
4pm. Learned counsel for the insurance company does not dispute
issuance of the cover note on 25th January, 2000 at 2 pm and no
dispute is also raised with regard to the timing of the accident, i.e. at
4pm on 25th January, 2000. Admittedly, the corresponding policy
issued in respect of said cover note has been stated to be effective
6.     Mr. Panigrahi while submitting his case relies on a decision of
the Supreme Court rendered in the case of Oriental Insurance Co.
Ltd. v. Dharam Chand @ Others, 2011 (I) OLR (SC) 103 to
substantiate his contention that the effectiveness of the policy should
be deemed to have commenced from the time of issuance of the cover
7.     On the contrary, Mr. Mishra, learned counsel for the insurance
company relies on a decision of the Madras High Court dated 3rd
March, 2022 rendered in CMA No.3291 of 2017 and CMP No.20764
of 2017 to contend that the policy coverage would operate only from
the date and time mentioned in the policy and not prior to that.
8.     In the case of Dharam Chand (supra), the Supreme Court have
stated that from the time the premium amount was received, the
insurance coverage must be deemed to have commenced from that
9.     The case of Madras High Court as cited by Mr. Mishra for the
insurance company, the same is found distinguishable on the present
facts of the case since in that case no cover note was issued and the
accident took place two days prior to issuance of the insurance policy.
10.    In terms of Section 64-VB of the Insurance Act, the risk on the
part of the insurer commences on receipt of payment of premium from
the insured.
11.    In the case at hand, the insurance policy bearing No. 034302/
31/021/11/07201/1999 was issued mentioning the effective date from
00:00 hours on 27th January, 2000 to 26th January, 2001. But the cover
FAO No.480 of 2012                                          Page 3 of 5
note as stated above has been issued on 25th January, 2000 at 2 pm
and it is clearly mentioned in the cover note that premium of
Rs.3012/- in respect of the vehicle in question have been paid and
received. Therefore, in terms of Section 64-VB of the Insurance Act
and the observation given by the Supreme Court in the case of
Dharam Chand (supra), it is held in the present facts of the case that,
the insurance coverage commenced from 2 pm on 25th January, 2000
as mentioned in the cover note. When the accident took place at 4pm,
i.e. 2 hours after the cover note was issued and premium received,
undoubtedly the liability of the insurer cannot be absolved.
12.    Mr. Panigrahi further contends that the Commissioner has
committed further error by not granting interest on the compensation
amount and observed that the interest would be payable only on
default of payment of compensation within the specified time. The
law is well settled in the case of Pratap Narain Singh Deo v. Srinivas
Sabata, (1976) 1 SCC 289 that the interest on the compensation
amount is payable from the date of accident. As such, this court is of
the opinion that the claimants are entitled for interest on the
compensation amount @ 12% per annum from the date of accident.
13.    In the result the appeal is allowed and the insurer – Respondent
No.2 is directed to pay the compensation amount of Rs.1,22,310/- on
behalf of the owner as directed by the Commissioner along with
interest @ 12% per annum from the date of accident, and shall deposit
the entire amount within a period of two months from today, which
shall be disbursed in favour of the claimant – Appellants on such
terms and proportion to be decided by the learned Commissioner.
