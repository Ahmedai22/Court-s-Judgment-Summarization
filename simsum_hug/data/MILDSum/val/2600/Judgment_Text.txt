of the parties, matter is taken up for final hearing at the
admission stage.
2.      Petitioner - National Highways Authority of India has
filed this Petition seeking leave of this Court to execute the
project of development of Vadodara Mumbai Expressway
(Phase-II Main Alignment) from Km 26+320 to km 104+700
(km 390.864 of NH-8) of Main Expressway (Length 78.118
km). Leave is sought as some portion of the project comes
within Coastal Regulation Zone - IA area. The project would
affect 2686 number of mangrove trees within proposed Right
of Way, out of which 1,001 mangrove trees are located within
(24) wp 9368.2021.doc
the construction zone, which are required to be felled. Leave is
sought in view of directions of this Court in paragraph 85 of
the judgment and order dated 17th September 2018 passed by
this Court in Public Interest Litigation No.87 of 2006 in
Bombay Environmental Action Group and Another Versus
State of Maharashtra and others.
3.         Petitioner - National Highways Authority of India
(NHAI) is constituted under Section 3 of The National
Highways Authority of India Act, 1988 and has been entrusted
with the development, maintenance and management of
National Highways and for matters connected therewith or
incidental thereto. The Government of India has entrusted to
Petitioner the project of development of Vadodara Mumbai
Expressway, which is a part of Delhi-Mumbai expressway
corridor. Petition concerns Phase-II Main Alignment from Km
26+320 to km 104+700 (km 390.864 of NH-8) of Main
Expressway (Length 78.118 km) (for short, “the project”). The
project of Vadodara Mumbai Expressway is part of the
is averred by Petitioner that the present traffic on NH-48 (old
NH-8) is about 94,322 PCUs (2020) and projected traffic is
(24) wp 9368.2021.doc
1,41,533 PCUs in 2030 which would exceed the capacity of
present 6 lane highway. Since, widening of NH-48(old N-8) is
not feasible, the Government of India has decided to construct
4.        The proposed expressway crosses Vaitarana River with
Coastal Regulation Zone (CRZ) categories CRZ I, II, III and IV.
The Village wise breakup of CRZ Categories as stated in the
Petition is as under;
Total (in ha)     3.20        2.68      6.36       1.17       12.83    0.00        7.95
Grand Total = 341809.3 Sq. m / 34.2 Ha
5.      Petitioner approached the Maharashtra Coastal Zone
Management Authority (“MCZMA”) with a proposal for
seeking its approval for environmental clearance. MCZMA in
its 144th meeting held on 11th June 2020 deliberated the
proposal of Petitioner and decided to recommend the same to
the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change
(“MoEFCC”) subject to conditions specified therein. MCZMA
accordingly conveyed its recommendations to the Director (IA-
III), Coastal Zone Regulation, MoEFCC, vide its letter dated 3 rd
September 2020. This is how the project has received
clearance from MCZMA.
6.      Petitioner simultaneously approached MoEFCC seeking
environmental clearance. After considering recommendations
of the Expert Appraisal Committee (“EAC”) for infrastructure,
CRZ and other miscellaneous projects, MoEFCC decided to
grant environmental and CRZ clearance for the project subject
to various conditions stated therein.
7.      As execution of project also envisaged diversion of some
portion of protected forest, mangrove private land and
mangroves on Government land, reserved forest and private
(24) wp 9368.2021.doc
forest land, Petitioner sought permission of MoEFCC for such
diversion. Vide letter dated 26th August 2021, MoEFCC was
pleased to grant permission for diversion of 193.1777 ha of
forest land subject to various conditions mentioned therein.
8.      Petitioner has also obtained various other permissions
from        the Monitoring   Committee    of   Dahanu       Taluka
Environment Protection Authority (DTEPA) on 4th March 2021
and Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (“MPCB”) on 19th
9.      On 6th January, 2011, MoEFCC published in the Gazette
Coastal Regulation Zone Notification (“CRZ Notification”) in ex-
ercise of powers conferred by clause (d) and sub rule (3) of
rule 5 of Environment (Protection) Act, 1986. The CRZ Notifi-
cation is issued inter alia to ensure livelihood & security to
fisher communities and other local communities living in the
coastal areas, to conserve and protect coastal stretches, its
unique environment and its marine area and to promote devel-
opment through sustainable manner based on scientific princi-
ples taking into account the dangers of natural hazards in the
coastal areas, sea level rise due to global warming. The Notifi-
(24) wp 9368.2021.doc
cation declared coastal stretches of the country and the water
area upto its territorial water limit, excluding the islands of
Andaman and Nicobar and Lakshadweep and marine area sur-
rounding these islands upto its territorial limit, as Coastal Reg-
ulation Zone and restricted setting up and expansion of any in-
dustry, operations or processes and manufacture or handling
or storage or disposal of hazardous substances in the aforesaid
10.     CRZ Notification classified various CRZ areas as under:
7. Classification of the CRZ – For the purpose of conserving and pro-
tecting the coastal areas and marine waters, the CRZ area shall be
classified as follows, namely:-
A.   The areas that are ecologically sensitive and the geomorphologi-
cal features which play a role in the maintaining the integrity of
(a) Mangroves, in case mangrove area is more than 1000 sq
mts, a buffer of 50meters along the mangroves shall be pro-
(b) Corals and coral reefs and associated biodiversity;
(d) Mudflats which are biologically active;
(e) National parks, marine parks, sanctuaries, reserve forests,
wildlife habitats and other protected areas under the provi-
sions of Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972 (53 of 1972), the
Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980 (69 of 1980) or Environ-
ment (Protection) Act, 1986 (29 of 1986); including Bio-
(g) Turtle nesting grounds;
(k) Areas or structures of archaeological importance and her-
itage sites.
B.    The area between Low Tide Line and High Tide Line;
(24) wp 9368.2021.doc
The areas that have been developed upto or close to the shore-
line.
Explanation.- For the purposes of the expression “developed area”
is referred to as that area within the existing municipal limits or in
other existing legally designated urban areas which are substan-
tially built-up and has been provided with drainage and approach
roads and other infrastructural facilities, such as water supply and
Areas that are relatively undisturbed and those do not belong to
either CRZ-I or II which include coastal zone in the rural areas
(developed and undeveloped) and also areas within municipal
limits or in other legally designated urban areas, which are not
substantially built up.
A. the water area from the Low Tide Line to twelve nautical
miles on the seaward side;
B. shall include the water area of the tidal influenced water
body from the mouth of the water body at the sea upto the
influence of tide which is measured as five parts per thou-
sand during the driest season of the year.
(v) Areas requiring special consideration for the purpose of pro-
tecting the critical coastal environment and difficulties faced by
local communities,-
A. (i) CRZ area falling within municipal limits of Greater
(ii) the CRZ areas of Kerala including the backwaters and
backwater islands;
B. Critically Vulnerable Coastal Areas (CVCA) such as Sunder-
bans region of West Bengal and other ecologically sensitive
areas identified as under Environment (Protection) Act,
1986 and managed with the involvement of coastal commu-
nities including fisherfolk.
Thus, as per the CRZ Notifications, areas where mangrove
trees are located as well as such area falling in 50 meters from
mangrove area of 1000 sq. mtrs. comes under CRZ-1A.
(24) wp 9368.2021.doc
Respondent No.3 herein had filed PIL No.87 of 2006 raising
issue of destruction of mangroves in the entire State of
Maharashtra. PIL came to be disposed of by this Court vide its
judgment and order dated 17th September 2018. In various
directives issued in paragraph 85 of the said judgment, this
Court has imposed total freeze on the destruction and cutting
of mangroves in the entire State of Maharashtra, stoppage of
all constructions within 50 meters on all sides of all mangroves
areas, prohibition of issuance of development permission by
any authority on any mangrove areas etc. The said Order came
to be modified by a further Order dated 27 th January 2010 in
PIL No. 87 of 2006, wherein this Hon’ble Court was pleased to
direct that nothing would prevent statutory bodies from
approaching competent authorities to seek permissions for
their respective projects as required in accordance with law
falling in mangrove areas and that such application would be
considered strictly in accordance with law keeping in mind the
principle of sustainable development and that grant of such
permission would be subject to the approval of this Court.
(24) wp 9368.2021.doc
12.     Accordingly, Petitioner has filed present Petition seeking
leave of this Court for execution of the project. It must be
noted here that even though it is averred in paragraph 21 of
the Petition that execution of the project would involve felling
of 1,001 mangrove trees, Petitioner has filed an additional
affidavit dated 19th January 2023 stating that only 350
number of mangrove trees are required to be felled for
execution of entire project. Furthermore, even though it is
stated in paragraph 23 of Petition that permission was needed
for diversion of 3.950 ha of mangrove forest land, it has been
clarified in affidavit dated 19th January 2023 that the
mangrove affected area falling within CRZ-IA would be only
0.0785 ha.
13.     Appearing   for   Petitioner    Mr. Singh,   the     learned
Additional Solicitor General of India would contend that
Petitioner has procured all requisite permissions from various
authorities like MCZMA, MoEFCC, DTEPA, MPCB etc for
execution of the project. He would explain us the importance
and need of the project involving public interest and would
urge us to grant leave to execute the project by granting
permission to fell 350 number of mangrove trees falling within
(24) wp 9368.2021.doc
CRZ-IA by diverting about 0.0785 ha forest area. Mr. Singh
would submit that this Court has granted permissions for
execution of several other projects of public importance. In
support of his contention Mr. Singh would rely on the following
State   of   Maharashtra         and     others      1
permission to Petitioner therein to execute the
involving felling of large number of mangrove trees.
(ii) Maharashtra Maritime Board Versus Union of India 2,
granting permission to Petitioner therein to execute
the project of construction of proposed passenger
jetty and allied facilities at Kelwa, Palghar and the
project of passenger jetties at various locations.
(iii) National Highways Authority of India Versus The
State of Maharashtra & ors 3: granting permission to
Petitioner therein for execution of work of widening
National Highway-3 involving felling of 91 number of
mangrove trees.
(iv) M.M.R.D.A. Versus Union of India and ors 4, granting
permission to project of Metro Line 6 partly falling
within CRZ – II.
2   WP No.759 of 2021 decided on 29th October 2021 of this Court.
3   WP No.2634 of 2021 decided on 22nd November 2021 of this Court.
4   WP-LD-VC No.87 of 2020 decided on 26th June 2020.
(24) wp 9368.2021.doc
(v) Jawaharlal Nehru Port Trust Versus Union of India
and ors 5 granting permission to Petitioner therein to
execute the project of proposed boat landing jetty at
(vi) National Highways Authority of India Versus The
State of Maharashtra and ors 6 granting permission to
Petitioner herein to fell mangrove trees for execution
of four-lane new bridge across Versova Creek.
14.     Mr. Rodrigues, the learned counsel appearing for Union
of India, Mr. Pabale, the learned Assistant Govt. Pleader
appearing for the State Government and Ms. Bagwe, the
learned counsel appearing for MCZMA, would confirm grant of
requisite permissions and clearances granted by their
respective clients for execution of the project.
15.     Mr.    Kelkar,   the     learned      counsel       appearing          for
Respondent No.3 – BEAG would oppose the Petition. Firstly, he
would urge to adjourn hearing of the present Petition till the
Supreme Court decides the Special Leave Petition (Civil) Diary
No.29692/2022 filed by BEAG challenging the judgment and
order dated 29th October, 2021 passed by this Court in Writ
5 WP ST No.424 of 2021 decided on 14th January 2021 of this Court.
6 WP (L) No.203 of 2019 decided on 21st February 2019 of this Court.
(24) wp 9368.2021.doc
Petition No.442 of 2020 (Maharashtra Maritime Board Versus
Union of India). He would then express an apprehension about
Petitioner proposing to fell higher number of mangrove trees
(10001) and affecting / diversing larger area (3.950 ha) for
executing the project. This apprehension is expressed on the
basis of averments in paragraphs 21 and 23 of Petition. Mr.
Kelkar would take us through various provisions of Coastal
Regulation Zone Notification dated 6th January 2011 to
demonstrate as to how the proposed project of construction of
Highway cannot be executed in area falling within CRZ-IA. Mr.
Kelkar would urge this Court not to grant leave to Petitioner
for felling any mangrove trees or for diversion of mangrove
forest area in any manner. Mr. Kelkar would therefore pray for
dismissal of the Petition.
16.     After having heard learned counsels appearing for the
parties, there appears to be no dispute on the position that
Petitioner has procured all requisite permissions from all
authorities such as MCZMA, MoEFCC, DTEPA, MPCB etc. for
execution of proposed project. All authorities have imposed
stringent conditions on Petitioner for grant of their respective
permission. To illustrate, MoEFCC while granting permission
(24) wp 9368.2021.doc
for diversion of forest lands on 26th August 2021 has imposed
condition    of   compensatory    afforestation  through       forest
departments at lands indicated therein. Another condition is to
develop a separate nursery to raise at least 1,00,000 seedlings
of forestry species.
17.     Though the Petition is opposed by BEAG, the need and
importance of project is fairly not disputed by it. BEAG has
essentially     raised  the   issue    about   permissibility        of
development of the project in the area falling within CRZ – IA.
Relying on the various provisions of the Notification dated 6 th
January 2011, BEAG has strenuously made efforts to show
that development of road or bridge is impermissible in the area
falling within CRZ-IA. We could have dealt with this aspect by
examining various provisions of CRZ Notification and their
interpretation. However, we observe that the issue sought to be
raised by BEAG is no more res integra and all the submissions
of Mr. Kelkar based on CRZ Notification are already dealt with
by this Court in its judgment in Maharashtra Maritime Board
Versus Union of India (supra). The contentions of BEAG with
regard to permissibility of carrying out development work in
CRZ-IA area has been negatived by this Court. This Court in
(24) wp 9368.2021.doc
paragraph nos. 26 to 29 of the judgment held as under:
26. In addition to the regulation of permissible activities in CRZ
areas as provided in paragraph 4 of the said notification, the norms
for regulation of activities permissible under the said notification
are provided for in paragraph 8 and which are specific to the
different regulations namely Regulations I to IV. In so far as CRZ-I is
concerned,       paragraph 8 provides that the development or
construction activities in different categories of CRZ shall be
regulated by the concerned Coastal Zone Management Authority
(CZMA), in accordance with the norms as specified in each of the
CRZ i.e. CRZ-I to CRZ-IV. In so far as CRZ-I is concerned, it clearly
provides that no new construction shall be permitted in CRZ-I
except for the activities expressly mentioned in sub-clauses (a) to
(f). The relevant being sub-clause (c) of paragraph 8 which carves
out an exception for the facilities that are essential for the activities
permissible under CRZ-I. This has some relevance in so far as the
permissible activities in CRZ-I are concerned, namely, those directly
related to waterfront or directly needing foreshore facilities as
provided in paragraph 3 read with paragraph 4 which also
recognizes construction and operation for ports and harbours,
jetties, wharves, quays, slipways, ship construction yards,
breakwaters, groynes, erosion control measures etc. This apart,
CRZ-I includes the area between Low Tide Line and High Tide Line.
Paragraph 8 (I)(ii) provides that the areas between Low Tide Line
and High Tide Line which are not ecologically sensitive, necessary
safety measures will be incorporated while permitting interalia
construction of dispensaries, schools, public rain-shelter,
community toilets, bridges, roads, jetties, erosion control measures,
water supply etc. Thus, on a holistic reading of paragraph 8, it is not
a case that no new construction Is permitted in CRZ-I, when it
permits construction of projects relating to Department of Atomic
Energy, installation of pipelines, conveying systems including
transmission lines, providing for facilities that are essential for
activities permissible as provided in sub-clauses (a) to (f) under
CRZ-I. In the present context, the relevant provision under
paragraph 8 (I) (CRZ-I) is sub-clause (c) which permits setting up
“the facilities that are essential for activities permissible under CRZ-
I”. These are activities directly related to waterfront or directly
needing foreshore facilities, held to be permissible under the said
notification such as ports and harbours, jetties, quays, wharves,
erosion control measures, breakwaters, pipelines, lighthouses,
navigational safety facilities, coastal police stations as provided for
in paragraph 3(i)(a) of the said notification as also falling under
paragraph 4(i)(f) dealing with the regulation of permissible
activities in relation to construction and operation for ports and
harbours, jetties, wharves, quays, slipways, ship construction
yards, breakwaters, groynes, erosion control measures and salt
works.
27.        It is thus difficult to accept Mr.Jagtiani’s contention
that the activity of construction of a jetty merely because it falls in a
buffer zone of 50 meters along the mangrove area, would amount to
a prohibited activity under the CRZ-I. Such interpretation certainly
is not reflected from a cumulative reading of paragraphs 3, 4 and 8
of the 2011 Notification as understood in the context of paragraph 7
of the 2011 Notification, which classifies CRZ into such different
categories. If the interpretation as suggested by Mr.Jagtiani is
accepted, it would negate so many of the essential activities in the
CRZ I, which are clearly specified in paragraph 3 and paragraph 4
read with paragraph 8 as permissible activities as discussed above,
being activities requiring waterfront and foreshore facilities,
construction and operation of ports and harbours, jetties, wharves,
quays, slipways, ship construction yards, breakwaters, groynes,
erosion control measures etc. to name some.
28.       In interpreting the 2011 CRZ Notification, it cannot be
overlooked that the object of the notification is not merely
protecting the environment but also while doing so promoting the
development through sustainable manner, which is also a significant
object being achieved in regulating activities in the coastal zone
areas. Thus, CRZ-I cannot be interpreted to mean a zone which
freezes every activity. In other words, in the present context,
merely because the area is a mangrove area which is more than
1000 sq.meters requiring buffer zone of 50 meters along the
mangroves to be provided as prescribed in paragraph 7 of the 2011
Notification, it cannot be inferred that no activity such as the one
intended to be undertaken by the petitioner, becomes a prohibited
activity. Such a reading of the Notification would render nugatory
the activities specifically permitted in the CRZ-I zone as clear from
the reading of paragraph 3, 4 and 8 of the 2011 Notification.
29.        From a holistic reading of the different paragraphs of
the 2011Notification as discussed above, it cannot be said that there
is any prohibition to the permissible activities as recognized under
the Notification itself. In our opinion, Mr. Mone would be correct in
placing reliance on the decision of the Supreme Court in N.D.Jayal
& Anr. Vs. Union of India & Ors. (supra) wherein the Supreme Court
has reiterated the principles as laid down in Vellore Citizens Welfare
Forum v. Union of India and M C Mehta v. Union of India, that a
balance between environmental protection and developmental
activities can only be maintained by strictly following the principles
of ‘sustainable development’. The Supreme Court held that the
principle of sustainable development is a development strategy that
caters to the needs of the present, without negotiating the ability of
upcoming generations to satisfy their needs and that strict
observance of sustainable development would put us on a path that
ensures development while protecting the environment, a path that
works for all people and for all generations. It is held that all
(24) wp 9368.2021.doc
environmental related developmental activities should benefit more
people while maintaining the environmental balance which could be
ensured only by the strict adherence of sustainable development,
without which life for coming generations will be in jeopardy. It was
held that the adherence to the principles of sustainable
development is a sine qua non for the maintenance of the symbiotic
balance between the rights to environment and development. It is
also held that the right to development cannot be treated as a mere
right to economic betterment or cannot be limited to as a misnomer
to simple construction activities. It is observed that right to
development encompasses much more than economic well being,
and includes within its definition the guarantee of fundamental
rights, which are an integral part of human rights. It is hence held
that the construction of a dam or a mega project is definitely an
attempt to achieve the goal of wholesome development, and such
works could very well be treated as integral component for
development. To ensure sustainable development is held to be one of
the goals of Environmental Protection Act, 1986 which is necessary
to make effective the guarantee of‘ 'right to life’' under Article 21.
The Supreme Court, hence, has observed that the concerned
authorities by exercising its powers under the Act will have to
ensure the acquiescence of sustainable development, hence, the
Environment Protection Act cannot be treated as a power
simpliciter, but it is a power coupled with duty.
18.      Thus this Court in Maharashtra Maritime Authority
rejected the contention of BEAG that no development activity
can be carried out in CRZ-1A area. This Court also emphasized
the     importance and need of carrying out large projects of
public importance by maintaining environment balance and
adhering to the principle of sustainable development.
19.     It must however be noted here that the judgment in
Maharashtra Maritime Board (supra) has been assailed by
BEAG before the Apex Court by filing Special Leave Petition
(Civil) Diary No.29692 of 2022. While issuing notices in SLP
(24) wp 9368.2021.doc
filed by BEAG, the Apex Court has stayed the directions of this
Court by order dated 10th October 2022. We did adjourn the
present Petition at the request of BEAG for some period.
However mere grant of stay in Maharashtra Maritime Board
cannot be a reason to keep present Petition pending
indefinitely, particularly considering the importance and need
involved in execution of the project. It is also well settled law
that mere stay of this Court’s Order by the Supreme Court
would not wipe out that order. We may make useful reference
in this regard to the Judgment of the Apex Court in Shree
Chamundi Mopeds Ltd. v. Church of South India Trust Assn. ,
(1992) 3 SCC 1, in which it is held as under:
While considering the effect of an interim order staying
the operation of the order under challenge, a distinction
has to be made between quashing of an order and stay of
operation of an order. Quashing of an order results in the
restoration of the position as it stood on the date of the
passing of the order which has been quashed. The stay of
operation of an order does not, however, lead to such a
result. It only means that the order which has been
stayed would not be operative from the date of the
passing of the stay order and it does not mean that the
said order has been wiped out from existence. This
means that if an order passed by the Appellate Authority
is quashed and the matter is remanded, the result would
be that the appeal which had been disposed of by the said
order of the Appellate Authority would be restored and it
can be said to be pending before the Appellate Authority
after the quashing of the order of the Appellate
Authority. The same cannot be said with regard to an
order staying the operation of the order of the Appellate
(24) wp 9368.2021.doc
Authority because in spite of the said order, the order of
the Appellate Authority continues to exist in law and so
long as it exists, it cannot be said that the appeal which
has been disposed of by the said order has not been
disposed of and is still pending.
20.     After considering the provisions of CRZ Notification, we
are convinced that development of roads and bridges is a
permissible activity and in any case not a prohibited activity.
Relevant provision of the Notification reads thus:
Prohibited activities within CRZ,- The following are declared as pro-
hibited activities within the CRZ,-
(iv) Land reclamation, bunding or disturbing the natural course of
seawater except those,-
(a) required for setting up, construction or modernisation or expan-
sion of foreshore facilities like ports, harbours, jetties, wharves,
quays, slipways, bridges, sealink, road on stilts, and such a s meant
for defence and security purpose and for other facilities that are es-
sential for activities permissible under the notification;
(Emphasis supplied)
21.     As contended by Mr. Singh, this Court has granted
permissions for execution of various projects by several
proponents including the National Highways Authority of India
for execution of works of public importance.
22.     The concerns expressed by BEAG about felling of higher
number of mangrove trees and diversion of larger area of
mangrove forest are taken care of by the additional affidavit
(24) wp 9368.2021.doc
dated 19th January 2023 filed by Petitioner in which it is
clarified that only 350 mangrove trees would be felled and
0.0785 ha of mangrove forest would be diverted. Thus, even
though Petitioner has requested clearance from the various
authorities for diversion of larger area of mangrove forest it
has undertaken before this Court to restrict the diversion only
to 0.0785 of mangrove forest area as well as felling of 350
number of mangrove trees. Mr. Singh has assured this Court
that NHAI would scrupulously comply with its statements
made in additional affidavit with regard to number of
mangrove trees to be felled and area of diversion of mangrove
forest. We reproduce paragraph 1 of the additional affidavit
filed on 19th January 2023 as under;
1. I am GM(T) & Project Director PIU-Thane, and I am aware of the
facts of the above-mentioned case, and I am filing this Affidavit to
place on record that the number of mangrove trees which will be
affected due to construction of bridge over Vaitarna River for the
purpose of connecting Vadodara-Mumbai Green Field Express
Highway at Palghar District may be approximately 350 mangrove
trees. The mangrove affected area (permanently) would be within
CRZ-1A in about 0.0785 hectares. The construction is by way of
“well” foundation / pile foundation with 10 m dia periphery within
the CRZ-1A area and major mangroves shall be affected at a total 10
nos of pier locations with scattered mangroves affected at other few
locations. To show the location of bridge as well as the Pillars within
CRZ-1A area, Hereto annexed to and marked Exhibit-A is the copy of
sketch plan.
23.      Various     authorities     have     already     imposed          strict
conditions on NHAI including that of afforestation while
(24) wp 9368.2021.doc
granting their respective permissions. NHAI will have to
strictly comply those conditions. This will ensure adherence to
the principle of sustainable development.
24. Bharatmala Pariyojana is a new umbrella program for the
highways sector that focuses on optimizing efficiency of freight
and passenger movement across the country by bridging
critical infrastructure gaps through effective interventions like
development of Economic Corridors, Inter Corridors and
Border and International connectivity roads, Coastal and Port
connectivity roads and Green-field expressways. Its an
ambitious and mammoth project of Government of India, of
which Delhi-Mumbai express way is a part. Vadodara-Mumbai
greenfield expressway which forms part of Delhi-Mumbai
expressway corridor will benefit large sections of population in
Maharashtra, Gujrat and Union Territory of Daman, Dadra &
Nagar Haveli. Execution of project Considering the importance
of the project proposed to be undertaken by Petitioner, we
deem it appropriate to grant permission as sought for in the
25. The Petition is accordingly allowed in terms of prayer
clause (a) which reads thus;
(a) That this Hon’ble Court may be pleased to grant permission to
the Petitioner i.e. National Highways Authority of India to remove /
fell mangrove trees in an area admeasuring 3.9500 ha of mangrove
forest land for the Development of Vadodara Mumbai Expressway
(Phase-II Main Alignment) from Km 26+320 to km 104+700 (km
390.864 of NH-8) of Main Expressway (Length 78.118 km) to be
executed on Hybrid Annuity Mode in the State of Maharashtra.”
26.     Rule is made absolute accordingly.
