Opposite Party :- State of U.P. and Another
Counsel for Applicant :- Umesh Pal Singh
Counsel for Opposite Party :- G.A.
Counter affidavit filed by the learned A.G.A., is taken on
Heard learned counsel for the applicant as well as learned
A.G.A. and perused the record.
The accused- applicant, Manoj Saxena, is involved in Case
Crime No.189 of 2022, under Sections 376A, B, 354 I.P.C. &
It is submitted by the learned counsel for the applicant that
there is general allegation in the FIR. In the statements under
Sections 161 and 164 Cr.P.C. of the victim, there is no
ingredient of Section 376 I.P.C. No medical has been conducted
as the parents of the victim denied to get her daughter medically
examined. No injury has been found on the person of the
victim. In fact the father of the victim is a police personnel and
this FIR is only the misuse of that power. The applicant is 50
years of age so the incident appears to be suspicious. He is
languishing in jail since 13.04.2022 and in case he is enlarged
on bail he will not misuse the liberty of bail. Hence, bail has
been prayed for.
Learned A.G.A. has opposed the bail application and submitted
that as per medical report, the victim is 10 years of age and as
per school leaving certificate the age of the girl is seven years.
From the perusal of the FIR, it appears that in the absence of
other family members when eight years old victim was alone at
her home and when she saw her TV dish connection was
disturbed, she called Manoj Saxena (applicant), the person who
used to go to repair the dish connection. When Manoj Saxena
(applicant) came inside the house, he saw the girl alone at her
home, he started vulgar activities with her. The victim made hue
and cry then he ran away from the house. In the statement under
Section 161 Cr.PC. the victim has stated that when Manoj
Saxena came in the house of the first informant to repair the
dish connection, seeing the girl alone at her home he inserted
his hand in her clothes and kissed her on lips. As per statement
under Section 164 Cr.P.C. of the victim, Manoj Saxena came at
the house of the first informant repaired the dish connection
then hold her tightly and kissed on her lips, inserted his hand
into her panty and also pressed her breast by inserting her hands
therein.
Admittedly, the parents of the victim have denied for any
medical examination of the victim.
Having heard the submissions of learned counsel of both sides,
considering the seriousness of the charge and the severity of
punishment in case of conviction and the nature of supporting
evidence, prima facie satisfaction of the Court in support of the
charge, reformative theory of punishment, and larger mandate
of the Article 21 of the Constitution of India, the dictum of
Apex Court in the case of Dataram Singh v. State of U.P. and
another, reported in (2018) 2 SCC 22 and without expressing
any opinion on the merit of the case, I find it to be a case of
bail.
Let the applicant, Manoj Saxena, who is involved in aforesaid
crime be released on bail on his furnishing a personal bond and
two sureties each in the like amount to the satisfaction of the
court concerned subject to following conditions.
1. The applicant will attend and co-operate in the trial pending
before the court concerned on the date fixed after release.
2. He will not tamper with the witnesses.
3. He will not indulge himself in any illegal activities during the
bail period.
The identity, status and residential proof of sureties will be
verified by the court concerned and in case of breach of any of
the above conditions, the court below shall be at liberty to
cancel the bail and send the applicant to prison.
It is clarified that the observations, if any, made in this order are
strictly confined to the disposal of this bail application and must
not be construed to have any reflection on the ultimate merits of
the case.
In case of breach of any of the above conditions, it shall be a
ground for cancellation of bail.
