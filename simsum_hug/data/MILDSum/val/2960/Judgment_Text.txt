family is agriculture and they have no other source of income.                   The
petitioner got married and living with his wife and mother jointly. The
mother of the petitioner used to go for agricultural work everyday. There
was a huge problem in the Village with regard to the stray dogs. The
District Administration took steps to control the outnumbered population of
stray dogs by catching and sterilizing them. The same was opposed by the
Animal Welfare Organization during the relevant point of time. The District
Administration deputed the said work to the Local Village Panchayat. As
such, the respondents 5 and 6 engaged the 8th respondent who belongs to
“Narikuravar Community” to shoot out the stray dogs wandering on the
streets.
3.On 25.02.2015 at about 9.30 p.m., the respondents 5 to 7 along
with the 8th respondent shot down the stray dogs in the Village. During that
time, the mother of the petitioner was doing her household works. The 8 th
respondent randomly shot down the stray dogs without aiming or without
any concern, he shoot the mother of the petitioner and she sustained serious
injuries in her foot.       Immediately, she was taken to the Government

Government Hospital by the respondents 5 to 7 on 25.02.2015, the bullet
was not removed from the leg of the mother of the petitioner. She was
provided with treatment only for the injury and was discharged.                The

been done till today. The petitioner states that the respondents 3 and 4 are
hand-in-glove with the respondents 5 to 7 and they are highly influential

agricultural coolie and the respondents 5 to 8 are powerful persons in the

“4.I submit that on our enquiry, it is came to know
that due to Berries dog in Eraiyur Pt. it was decided by the
formerly President of Eraiyur Mr.Kolanji, Vice President
Mr.Chinnadurai and Union Councilor Mr.Jeyaraman have
a discussion together and fixed one person Narikurava
named Ramadurai on 25.02.2015 for shooting the dogs
during 10.00 p.m.       On that day the deceased person

9.The 6th respondent filed a counter stating that he was no way
connected with the alleged incident.
10.However, the status report as well as the counter affidavit filed by
the Inspector of Police and the Block Development Officer categorically
reveals that the respondents 5 to 7 instructed the 8th respondent to shoot out
the stray dogs in that Village and while carrying out the instructions of the
respondents 5 to 7, the mother of the petitioner sustained bullet injuries and
she was admitted in the hospital. Unfortunately, the bullet was not removed
immediately and subsequently, she died on account of the fact that the bullet
injury which was inside the leg is the cause for the death. The medical
report also revealed that a small bullet which was used in the country gun,
more particularly, by the Narikuravars was found in her foot and the said
bullet was not removed at the time of providing treatment in Government
Hospital on 25.02.2015. This being the factum established, the criminal cse
registered must go on and the 3rd respondent should urge the criminal Court
of law to proceed with the matter as expeditiously as possible.
11.As far as the writ petition is concerned, the petitioner could able to
establish a prima facie case and the death of the mother of the petitioner
occurred due to the illegal operation conducted by the respondents 5 to 8 by
shooting the stray dogs in that Village. Shooting the stray dogs itself is an
illegal act. The respondents 5 to 7 engaged the 8 th respondent and thereby
committed the act of illegality and an offence. The prosecution has been
initiated and it is for them to defend their case before the Competent Court
of law.         However, the petitioner is entitled for compensation as the 5 th
respondent is the President and the respondents 6 and 7 were the
12.It is an unusual incident where the responsible Panchayat President
and the Councilors have engaged the 8th respondent for shooting out the
stray dogs in the Village. The very operation itself is illegal and further the
bullet removed from the mother of the petitioner during postmortem
confirms that the death occurred due to the bullet injuries. Under these
circumstances, this Court is inclined to consider the case of the petitioner for
grant of compensation. Unfortunately, the official respondents 1 to 4 have
not shown an sensitiveness in this matter nor initiated appropriate immediate
action, contrarily they have slowed down the actions and thereby colluded in
a passive manner. Even the passive collusion of the public authorities can
never be tolerated. The illegal operations made by the respondents 5 to 8
were not seriously taken nor immediate actions are initiated.
13.This being the factum established, the respondents 5 to 7 are
directed to jointly pay a sum of Rs.5,00,000/- [Rupees Five Lakhs only] to
the petitioner towards compensation.            Further, the first respondent is
directed to pay a sum of Rs.5,00,000/- [Rupees Five Lakhs only] to the
petitioner.       Thus, the petitioner is entitled for a total compensation of
Rs.10,00,000/- [Rupees Ten Lakhs only]. The respondents 1, 5, 6 & 7 are
directed to settle their respective portion of the compensation in favour of the
writ petitioner within a period of eight weeks from the date of receipt of a
copy of this order. The amount of compensation is to be shared between the
legal heirs of the deceased mother of the petitioner equally and in this
regard, the petitioner is directed to furnish legal heir certificate and the
particulars of the legal heirs to the first respondent District Collector within a
period of four weeks from the date of receipt of a copy of this order.
15.With these directions, the writ petition stands allowed. No costs.
