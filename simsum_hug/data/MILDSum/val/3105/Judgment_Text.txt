Mr. Gaurav Agrawal, learned Amicus Curiae has drawn our attention to order dated
29.11.2022 qua the issue of undertrial prisoners who continue to be in custody despite
having been granted the benefit of bail on account of their inability to fulfill the conditions.
In this behalf the report by the NALSA has been placed before us filed on 30.01.2023.
After recording the discussions which have been held, it has been stated in para 5 of the
report that there are 5,000 undertrial prisoners who were in jail, despite grant of bail, out
of which, 2,357 persons were provided legal assistance and now 1,417 persons have
since been released.
One of the main reasons flagged why the accused are in jail despite the grant of
bail is that he may be an accused in multiple cases and is apparently not willing to furnish
bail bonds until he is given bail in all the cases as undertrial custody will be counted in all
the cases.
De hors this, it is pointed out that to ensure that the remaining undertrial prisoners
who are unable to furnish surety or bail bonds due to poverty, NALSA is in the process of
creating a master data of all such undertrial prisoners in excel sheet with all relevant
details, including, reasons for non-release and steps qua persons who are unable to
furnish bail bonds or surety are being taken up with the respective SLSAs/DLSAs and
result would be obtainable in about one or two months’ time.
Learned Amicus Curiae has also drawn our attention to the discussions with Shri
Shashikant Sharma, HOD and Sr. Technical Director of NIC recording that five meetings
were held along with the participation of Shri K.M. Nataraj, learned ASG and Home
Ministry officials. A Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) has been prepared by NIC which
also deals with this aspect. A relevant aspect is that the NIC e-prison software, which is
working in about 1,300 jails in the country, would now have a field where the date of grant
of bail would have to be entered by the jail authorities. If the accused is not released within
seven days of the date of grant of bail, the e-prison software would automatically generate
a flag/reminder and simultaneously the e-mail would be sent to the office of the concerned
DLSA so that the DLSA can find out the reason for non-release of the accused. The SOP
has para 2.4 under the heading “Bailed out but not Released” which facility enables prison
user to access the data of inmates, to assist in identifying inmates who are bailed out but
not released due to some reasons like sureties or pending cases.
Insofar as the discussion with TISS is concerned, some suggestions are stated to
be made but learned Amicus Curiae submits that a more detailed work out of that is
Another issue which has crept up during discussion is whether the Government
would give access to this portal on a protected basis to the Secretaries of the SLSAs and
DLSAs which would facilitate better follow up.
We call upon the Government of India to discuss this issue with NALSA so that
necessary directions, if any, can be passed. Learned ASG would obtain instructions in
that behalf by the next date.
With a view to ameliorate the problems a number of directions are sought. We have
examined the directions which we reproduce hereinafter with certain modifications:
“1)     The Court which grants bail to an undertrial prisoner/convict would be required to
send a soft copy of the bail order by e-mail to the prisoner through the Jail Superintendent
on the same day or the next day. The Jail Superintendent would be required to enter the
date of grant of bail in the e-prisons software [or any other software which is being used
by the Prison Department].
2)      If the accused is not released within aperiod of 7 days from the date of grant of bail,
it would be the duty of the Superintendent of Jail to inform the Secretary, DLSA who may
depute para legal volunteer or jail visiting advocate to interact with the prisoner and assist
the prisoner in all ways possible for his release.
3)      NIC would make attempts to createnecessary fields in the e-prison software so that
the date of grant of bail and date of release are entered by the Prison Department and in
case the prisoner is not released within 7 days, then an automatic email can be sent to
4)      The Secretary, DLSA with a view to findout the economic condition of the accused,
may take help of the Probation Officers or the Para Legal Volunteers to prepare a report
on the socio-economic conditions of the inmate which may be placed before the
concerned Court with a request to relax the condition (s) of bail/surety.
5)      In cases where the undertrial or convictrequests that he can furnish bail bond or
sureties once released, then in an appropriate case, the Court may consider granting
temporary bail for a specified period to the accused so that he can furnish bail bond or
6)      If the bail bonds are not furnished within one month from the date of grant bail, the
concerned Court may suo moto take up the case and consider whether the conditions of
bail require modification/ relaxation.
7)      One of the reasons which delays therelease of the accused/ convict is the insistence
upon local surety. It is suggested that in such cases, the courts may not impose the
condition of local surety.”
We order that the aforesaid directions shall be complied with.
IA No. 203407/2022 and IA NO. 203408/2022 have been filed for intervention and
appropriate directions by the National Law University, Delhi through Fair Trial Fellowship
Programme under Project 39A.
We are of the view that instead of looking to the suggestions and directions sought,
more appropriate course of action would be for Shri Gaurav Agrawal, learned Amicus to
look into them on behalf of the NALSA and accordingly make suggestions to us taking
them as inputs.
