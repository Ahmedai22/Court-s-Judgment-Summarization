These two petitions have been disposed of by
a common order.        The facts of these two petitions
2. The petitioner in Criminal Revision Petition
989/2012     is  the   accused     in Special  Case   No.
19/2008 on the file of II Additional District and
Sessions (Special) Judge, D.K, Mangalore, facing
trial for the offence under section 3(1)(ix) of the
Scheduled      Castes    and     the  Scheduled    Tribes
(Prevention of Atrocities) Act (for short hereinafter
referred   to   as   ‘the  Act’).     The  petitioner  in
Criminal Revision Petition 988/2012 is the accused
in Special Case No. 23/2008 on the file of the
same court for the same offence.              They were
prosecuted for the said offence on the allegation
that they produced false caste certificates to show
that they belonged to Marathi caste which comes
under Scheduled Tribe category.           Charge sheet
was filed for the offence under section 3(1)(x) of
the Act.    The petitioners filed applications under
section 227 Cr.P.C seeking their discharge.              The
court    below    by   its    order      dated    22.8.2012
dismissed     their  applications       and   hence    these
revision petitions.
3.   I have heard Sri Nataraja Ballal, learned
counsel   for   the  petitioner     in   Criminal  Revision
Petition   No.   988/2012      and     Sri  Suyog    Herele,
learned   counsel    for   the    petitioner   in   Criminal
Revision Petition No. 989/2012.          I have also heard
the learned Government Pleader.
4.    Sri Nataraj Ballal and Sri Suyog Herele
submit that the caste certificates were issued in
the years 1977 and 1983.               When these caste
certificates   were   issued,      the   Act   was   not  in
existence, it enacted in the year 1989.          It was not
an offence at the time when the caste certificates
were issued. The petitioners cannot be prosecuted
for the offence under section 3(1)(x) of the Act.
The   second    point    of   argument      is  that   even
assuming that the certificates are falsely obtained
by   the  petitioners,     the     provisions   of   section
3(1)(ix)  of  the    Act   are    not   attracted.     Their
submission   is   that   giving     false  information    to
obtain a caste certificate to the effect that the
petitioners belonged to Scheduled Tribe does not
amount    to  an    offence    within    the   meaning    of
section 3(1)(x) of the Act (as it stood before
amendment) because there is nothing to show that
by giving false information to a public servant, the
petitioners intended to induce that public servant
to cause annoyance to a member of Scheduled
Caste or Scheduled Tribe.           Moreover they submit
that the matter is still pending before the District
Caste Verification Committee and it has not taken
any decision.    In this view, charge sheet could not
have   been   filed   against     the   petitioners.    The
learned Judge of the trial court ought to have
applied     his mind    that no offence is made out
against the petitioners and therefore he should
have allowed their applications under section 227
Cr.P.C for discharging them.        In support of their
arguments, they have placed reliance on some of
the judgments to which I will refer to later.
5.     The   learned   High  Court   Government
Pleader submits that the trial court is justified in
dismissing the applications for discharge.          It is
clearly observed by the trial court that at the time
of  framing     charge,   only   materials available   on
record should be considered to find out whether
there is a case for framing of charge or not.        It is
not necessary for the court to consider whether
the accused is going to be convicted or not and
such a conclusion can be drawn only after holding
trial.    The trial court has referred to some of the
authorities that the petitioners have now relied
upon      for  dismissing    their  applications  under
section 227 of Cr.P.C.       There are no infirmities in
the order and therefore, these petitions deserve to
be dismissed.
6.      I    have    considered      the    points  of
arguments.      So far as the petitioner in Criminal
Revision    Petition   988/2012       is  concerned,    the
allegation is that the petitioner, though belonged
to Konkani caste, gave false information to the
Tahsildar that he belonged to Marathi caste for
obtaining a caste certificate in order to secure
employment in New Mangalore Port Trust.                 The
allegation    against    the    petitioner    in   Criminal
Revision    Petition   989/2012      is  also   the  same.
There is no dispute that these caste certificates
were    issued   in  1977    and    1983.     Therefore   it
becomes      very    clear     that    when     the   caste
certificates were issued, the Act had not been
enacted at all, it came into force from 30.1.1990.
Article 20(1) of the Constitution of India clearly
says that, no person shall be convicted of any
offence except for violation of the law in force at
the time of the commission of the act charged as
an offence, nor be subjected to a penalty greater
than that which might have been inflicted under
the law in force at the time of the commission of
the offence.   Petitioners have been charge sheeted
for the offence under section 3(1)(ix) of the Act.
In view of Article 20(1) of the Constitution of
India, they cannot be prosecuted for the offence
under section 3(1)(ix) of the Act as the law did not
exist on the day when the certificates were issued.
This aspect has been made clear by the earlier
judgments of this court. In Haridevanandaji Rao
Pawar vs The State of Karnataka (Criminal
Petition No. 2813/2008), it is held as below: -
“7.   A certificate said to have
been issued originally during 1984,
but the provisions of section 3(1)(ix)
of    the    SC/ST      (Prevention  of
Atrocities)   Act,   1989,      came    into
effect  during    1990.       In  order   to
prosecute the petitioner, the mischief
should have been committed after the
enactment of the provision but for
the past act of mischief done by the
petitioner by applying the principle of
ex-post facto law, the petitioner has
to be exonerated from prosecuting.
However, the certificate produced by
the petitioner along with annexure at
page 5 of the petition shows that the
petitioner    belongs      to    Scheduled
7.  Then in the case of B.Venugopal vs The
State of Karnataka (Criminal Revision Petition
No. 321/2015), the judgment of this court in
Haridevanandaji has been referred to reiterate
the principle which is as follows : -
“8. Learned Judge of the trial
court   has   not  referred      about   the
applicability  of   Article    20   of   the
Constitution   of  India,    which   is  re-
iterated by this court in the case of
State of Karnataka.           The error  so
committed by learned trial Judge is
apparent on the face of the record
and hence the impugned order needs
to be set aside and the matter be
remitted back to the trial court to
pass    appropriate    order,   keeping  in
mind the principles re-iterated by this
court and the mandate of Article 20
of the Constitution of India.”
8.    In fact the judgment of this court in
Haridevanandaji was brought to the notice of the
trial   court   but, it  has    wrongly   held  that the
principle laid down therein is not applicable.
9.   Further, if it is examined whether section
3(1)(x) of the Act chould be invoked against the
petitioners, it may be stated that as the language
of the said section indicates, it is altogether for a
different purpose.      This court had an occasion to
deal with the applicability of section 3(1)(x) (now
section    3(1)(q)  of  the   Act   after  amendment).
Under    what   circumstances     this  section   can  be
invoked     is  discussed    in   the    case   of  Smt.
K.Susheela      vs  The   State    of   Karnataka     and
“7. Having heard the arguments,
it is to be stated that Section 3(1)(q)
of   the   Scheduled    Castes    and    the
Scheduled      Tribes    (Prevention      of
Atrocities) Act [3(1)(ix as it stood)
before amendment] reads:-
3. Punishments for offences
member of a Scheduled Caste
(q) gives any false or frivolous
information    to     any     public
servant   and    thereby     causes
such public servant to use his
lawful power to the injury or
Scheduled caste or a Scheduled
imprisonment for a term which shall
not be less than six months but which
may extend to five years and with
8.  If   this   section     is   read,   it
becomes clear that false or frivolous
information should have been given
to  a   public    servant     to   cause    that
public servant to use his authority for
causing    injury     or   annoyance      to   a
member      of    a   scheduled       caste   or
scheduled      tribe.       That     means,    a
public   servant      should     take    action
against a member of scheduled caste
or scheduled tribe upon a false or
frivolous     information       given    by    a
person    who       does    not    belong     to
scheduled caste or scheduled tribe,
and    such     action    should     result   in
injury or annoyance to a member of
scheduled caste or scheduled tribe.”
10.  Therefore it is clear that if a false caste
certificate is obtained by persons not belonging to
Scheduled Caste/Scheduled Tribe by giving wrong
information, it does not mean that a public servant
is induced to take action against a member of
Scheduled     Caste/Scheduled       Tribe.     The   said
provision cannot be invoked in the charge sheet
even if it is assumed for the argument sake that
certificates     are   obtained      by    giving  false
information.     In this view filing of charge sheet
against the petitioners was unwarranted.
11.   The trial court at the time of framing
charge must examine whether any offence is made
out   from   the   charge   sheet   or  not.    When   an
application under section 227 Cr.P.C., is made, the
trial Court has all the powers to discharge an
accused if the charge sheet does not indicate any
offence being committed.           Even at the time of
framing charge, the trial court has ample power to
examine whether the offence has been constituted
or not, and if no offence is forthcoming from the
charge sheet, the jurisdiction under section 227
Cr.P.C   can   be  exercised     for   discharging   the
accused.   In this case, apparently the trial court
has not exercised jurisdiction under section 227 of
Cr.P.C under an erroneous impression that only
the  High   Court   can   quash    the   charge  sheet.
Indeed the High Court can quash the charge sheet,
and at the same time if discharge is sought under
Section 227 of Cr.P.C., the Sessions Court or the
Special  Court   can  discharge     an   accused  if  no
offence is constituted.   Therefore I find that these
two petitions deserve to be allowed. Hence, I pass
(a)  Petitions are allowed.
(b) The   orders    of   the  trial court  dated
22.8.2012    in   both   the  cases  are set
aside.
(c) The applications filed by the petitioners
under section 227 Cr.P.C are allowed.
The  petitioners     are  discharged  of the
offence under section 3(1)(x) of the Act.
