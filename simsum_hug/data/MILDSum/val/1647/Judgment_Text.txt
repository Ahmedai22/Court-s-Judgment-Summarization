persons, the applicant-State of Gujarat has preferred this application
to grant leave to appeal as provided under Section 378(1)(3) of the
Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (‘the Code’ for short).
2.     The facts involved in the present appeal are reproduced in
2.1. The case of the prosecution, is that on 23.12.2017 at about
11:00 o’clock, while the complainant was going at the house of
Sanjaybhai at village Bagasara, he has received phone call from one
Rajubhai Chavda on his mobile, whereby he has informed to reach at
Bagasara, S.T. Depot as the Rajubhai Chavda is beaten by 7 to 8
persons in the S.T. Depot. Therefore, son of maternal uncle of the
complainant Pankaj came with the complainant on his motor cycle
and he had dropped the complainant at Bagasara S.T. Depot where
the said Rajubhai was standing and waiting for the complainant. The
complainant met Rajubhai and asked about the incident and
Rajubhai has informed him that he was beaten by Pratap @ Tiku
Vala, Gautam Vala and other five to six persons of village Timbla.
The complainant has seen Pratap @ Tiku Vala and Gautam Vala
departing from the place alongwith the other accused persons.
2.2. Complainant further stated that Pratapbhai @ Tiku Vala had
demanded Rs.500/- from Rajubhai which was not given by him and
therefore Pratap @ Tiku Vala and Gautam Vala and other five to six
persons gave me kick and fist blows and has also abused the
complainant in the filthy language relating to his caste and
threatened him to kill the complainant. Thereafter, Rajubhai has
gone to his factory of diamond polishing and complainant has gone
to his college.
2.3. It is the case of the prosecution that in the evening hours, the
complainant had tried to contact Rajubhai but he has not received
any reply and ultimately complainant had gone personally at the
house of Rajubhai and found that Rajubhai has committed suicide by
hanging himself below the fan. Therefore, the complainant has
lodged complainant with the        Bagasara Police Station which is
registered with C.R.I-40/2017 for the alleged offence punishable
under Section 306, 323, 504, 506(2) of the Indian Penal Code and
Section 3(1)(R), 3(1)(S) and 3(2)(5) of the Scheduled Castes and
Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989.
2.4. In pursuance of the complaint lodged by the complainant, the
Investigating Agency started investigation and collected evidence in
the form of statement of witnesses and also in the nature of
documentary evidence and after that found some material evidence
against the respondents-accused persons, the charge-sheet came to
be filed before the learned Court.
2.5. Upon the committal of the case, the Sessions Court at Dhari
registered the case as Special (Atrocity) Case No. 03 of 2018 and the
trial has commenced and the learned Trial Court has framed the
charge at Exh. 15 under Section 228(1)(B) of the Code of Criminal
Procedure, 1973 and statements of the accused persons were
recorded under Section 228(2) of the Code of Criminal Procedure,
1973 at Exh. 16 to Exh. 18. The accused person in the statement
pleaded (not guilty) and claimed to proceed with the trial.
3.       The prosecution has examined 20 witnesses and also produced
2.    Arrest panchnama of accused Nos. 1 and 2                             23
4.    Discovery panchnama for clothes from dead body                       27
9.   Yaddi made by the Medical Officer, Bagasara to the Head of                36
the Forensic Department of Bhavnagar Medical College.
10. Discovery Panchnama of muddamal motor-cycle                                38
12. Form for collection of viscera of dead body                                43
14. Caste certificate of the complainant                                       54
15. Site inspection report by F.S.L. van                                       56
17. Forwarding letter of F.S.L. Junagadh                                       61
18. Letter to include F.S.L. Officer as a witness in the charge-               62
19. Muddamal analysis report and opinion of the F.S.L. Junagadh                63
20. Certificate of Tibla Gram Panchayat of accused No. 2                       64
21. Certificate of Jamka Gram Panchayat of accused No. 1                       65
22. Certificate of Jamka Gram Panchayat of accused No. 3                       66
4.      Upon conclusion of the trial, the respondent-accused persons
were examined under the provisions of Section 313 of the Code of
Criminal Procedure and in their further statement, the respondents-
accused persons denied their involvement in the alleged crime and
stated that false case is lodged against them. After hearing both the
parties and after analysis of the evidence on record, the Sessions
Court at Dhari has acquitted the accused persons from the charge of
Section 306, 323, 504 and 506(2) of the Indian Penal Code
(hereinafter referred to as ‘IPC’ for short) as well as Section 3(1)
(R), 3(1)(S) and 3(2)(5) of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled
Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989 (‘the Act’ for short) by
giving benefit of doubt to the accused persons and therefore, the
present appeal is preferred by the State of Gujarat, being aggrieved
and dissatisfied with the judgment and order passed by learned
Sessions Court for acquittal of the accused.
5.     The learned APP Ms. Monali Bhatt has submitted that from
the deposition recorded of prosecution witness Nos. 10 and 11 by
Exh. 44 and 46 respectively, it clearly transpires that Rajubhai has
committed suicide due to the harassment caused by Pratap @ Tiku
Vala, Gautam Vala and other five to six persons. She has also
pointed out that there is deposition of Sagarbhai Shamjibhai Chavda
at Exh 44 who is the complainant, and he has stated that Rajubhai
has specifically earlier stated about incident of harassment which has
taken place. He has also deposed in his deposition that Rajubhai has
committed suicide due to torturous action of the accused. Learned
APP Ms. Monali Bhatt has also pointed out that from the deposition
of Jigar Hareshbhai Khitoliya at Exh. 46 and stated that he, being
eye-witness, his depositions cannot be discarded by the learned Trial
Court while appreciating the evidence. She has pointed out from the
deposition of the said witness that when he reached the S.T. Depot at
Bagasara, he found that there is a big gathering of the public and he
has also found that Pratap @ Tiku Vala and Gautam Vala were
beating Rajubhai with kick and fist blows and when he tried to
rescue Rajubhai, the accused Pratap @ Tikubhai has threatened him
in filthy language and also threatened him to go away from this
place otherwise they will kill Jigar Hareshbhai Khitoliya. He has
also deposed that Rajubhai thereafter informed him that Pratap @
Tiku Vala was asking for Rs.500/- from him and as Rajubhai has not
given said money to Pratap @ Tiku Vala, they have beaten Rajubhai
and thereafter he found that Rajubhai has committed suicide in the
evening at his residence and thereafter as per the submissions made
by learned APP Ms. Monali Bhatt that the said witness has also
supported the allegation of the complainant about the incident
occurred and he can be also considered as a eye-witness. She has
also pointed out that from the deposition of the prosecution witness
No. 7 Dr. Prakash Kumar Balubhai Savaliya at Exh. 32, the case of
the prosecution is also supported as the doctor has performed the
post mortem of the deceased Rajubhai and he has referred the body
to Sir T Hospital, Bhavnagar in order to find out the real cause of
death. Though, he has admitted that there is no external injury found
from the dead body except ligature mark. In substance, the said
witness is supporting the possibility of the death caused due to the
suicide committed by the deceased, the prosecution has also
examined         prosecution witness        No. 9   Dr.      Milindsingh
Badriprasadsingh Yadav at Exh. 41 who is a Medical Officer at Sir T
Hospital, Bhavnagar. He has also further carried out the post mortem
and has found that at the end of post mortem, the cause of death is
due to suffocation in the respiratory retract and therefore, learned
APP Ms. Monali Bhatt has also stated that prosecution has proved
that cause of death is unnatural, not natural and therefore, she has
submitted that learned Trial Court has committed error in giving
benefit of doubt to the accused persons and therefore she prays to
allow the appeal by exercising powers under Section 378 of the
6.     Before the evidences are further scrutinized, it is necessary
that prosecution is required to prove the case in the criminal
proceedings by leading cogent and convincing evidence and the
charge levelled against the accused persons should be proved beyond
7.     In the present case, neither complainant nor the other witness
examined at Exh. 47, Hareshbhai Khitoliya are supporting the case
of the prosecution in view of the charge framed against the accused
persons. On re-appreciation of the evidence, we have noticed that the
complaint of the complainant is not trustworthy and even from the
deposition of the complainant, we found no material which clearly
implicate the accused persons for the charge levelled against the
tham. We find that from the deposition given by the witness
Hareshbhai Khitoliya at Exh. 46, the said witness has not given his
version in the appeals, about Pratap @ Tiku Vala who has given the
threat about killing him if he has not left the place of offence. He has
also not stated that Rajubhai has told him that Pratap @ Tiku Vala
was asking Rs.500/- from him and as Rajubhai has not given that
amount, the accused persons have beaten Rajubhai. He has claimed
himself as eye-witness of the offence committed by the accused and
given his version that the accused have given 10 to 15 kick and fist
blows to Rajubhai but when we have perused the deposition of Dr.
Prakash Kumar Balubhai Savaliya at Exh. 32 in relation to the above
version of the witness Hareshbhai Khitoliyav are the doctor has
stated that there is no external injury or kick and fist blows found
from the body of the deceased Rajubhai and therefore the said aspect
about the veracity of the version given by the said witness is also
doubtful. The prosecution has also examined the witness at Exh. 49-
Nareshbhai Chhaganbhai Chavda but he was only available at the
house of Rajubhai as Rajubhai has committed suicide at his
residence and Nareshbhai Chhaganbhai Chavda being a brother of
Rajubhai has deposed, but he is not having any personal knowledge
about the earlier incident occurred at the S.T. Depot, Bagasara.
Another witness Khodabhai Raghavbhai Chavda, who is examined
at Exh. 50, has also stated that thus he was informed about such
incidence by Sagarbhai Shamjibhai Chavda and therefore he has no
personal knowledge about the alleged incident. The prosecution has
also examined witness Shamjibhai Badhabhai Chavda at Exh. 51 and
he has also not supported any version given in the complaint by the
complainant and he has reached at the residence of Rajubhai where
Rajubhai has committed suicide but he is not having anything
personal knowledge about the earlier incident occurred at S.T.
Depot, Bagasara and therefore he has also not supported the other
witnesses who are examined but they are turned hostile and they
have not given any start to the case of the prosecution. Now we
considered the Section 306 of the Indian Penal Code which is as
“Abetment of suicide.—If any person commits suicide, whoever
abets the commission of such suicide, shall be punished with
imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to
ten years, and shall also be liable to fine.”
And Section 107 which should be read with Section 107 of the
“Abetment of a thing.—A person abets the doing of a thing, who-
(i) Instigates any person to do that thing; or
(ii) Engages with one or more other person or persons in any conspiracy
for the doing of that thing, if an act or illegal omission takes place in
pursuance of that conspiracy, and in order to the doing of that thing; or
(iii) Intentionally aids, by any act or illegal omission, the doing of that
thing. Explanation 1.—A person who, by wilful misrepresentation, or by
wilful concealment of a material fact which he is bound to disclose,
voluntarily causes or procures, or attempts to cause or procure, a thing to
be done, is said to instigate the doing of that thing. Illustration A, a public
officer, is authorized by a warrant from a Court of Justice to apprehend
Z. B, knowing that fact and also that C is not Z, willfully represents to A
that C is Z, and thereby intentionally causes A to apprehend C. Here B
abets by instigation the apprehension of C. Explanation 2.—Whoever,
either prior to or at the time of the commission of an act, does anything in
order to facilitate the commission of that act, and thereby facilitate the
commission thereof, is said to aid the doing of that act.”
8.     And therefore to prove the element of offence under Section
306, the prosecution must prove the first ingredients of Section 107
which pertains to instigate. It is also fruitful to refer the judgment
reported on this aspect for the purpose of considering the aspect to
consider the word “instigate” the judgment reported in 2002 5 SCC
371 in the case of Sanju @ Sanjay Singh Sengar Vs. State of M.P.
where the Hon’ble Apex Court in para 12 is reproduced as under:
“Reverting to the facts of the case, both the courts below have
erroneously accepted the prosecution story that the suicide by the
deceased is the direct result of the quarrel that had taken place on
25.07.1998 wherein it is alleged that the appellant had used abusive
language and had reportedly told the deceased 'to go and die'. For this,
the courts relied on a statement of Shashi Bhushan, brother of the
deceased, made under Section 161 Cr.P.C. when reportedly the
deceased, after coming back from the house of the appellant, told him
that the appellant had humiliated him and abused him with filthy
words. The statement of Shashi Bhushan, recorded under Section 161
Cr.P.C. is annexed as annexure P-3 to this appeal and going through
the statement, we find that he has not stated that the deceased had told
him that the appellant had asked him 'to go and die'. Even if we accept
the prosecution story that the appellant did tell the deceased 'to go and
die', that itself does not constitute the ingredient of 'instigation'. The
word 'instigate' denotes incitement or urging to do some drastic or
unadvisable action or to stimulate or incite. Presence of mens rea,
therefore, is the necessary concomitant of instigation. It is common
knowledge that the words uttered in a quarrel or in a spur of the
moment cannot be taken to be uttered with mens rea. It is in a fit of
anger and emotional. Secondly, the alleged abusive words, said to have
been told to the deceased were on 25.07.1998 ensued by quarrel. The
deceased was found hanging on 27.07.1998. Assuming that the
deceased had taken the abusive language seriously, he had enough time
in between to think over and reflect and, therefore, it cannot be said
that the abusive language, which had been used by the appellant on
25.07.1998 drove the deceased to commit suicide. Suicide by the
deceased on 27.07.1998 is not proximate to the abusive language
uttered by the appellant on 25.07.1998. The fact that the deceased
committed suicide on 27.07.1998 would itself clearly pointed out that it
is not the direct result of the quarrel taken place on 25.07.1998 when it
is alleged that the appellant had used the abusive language and also
told the deceased to go and die. This fact had escaped notice of the
9.     It is also relevant to look at the observations made in para 9
and 12 from recent judgment in the case reported in 2021 SCC
OnLine SC 737, Kanchan Sharma Versus State of Uttar Pradesh
“9.      Having heard learned counsel on both sides, we have
perused the impugned order and other material placed on
record. Except the self-serving statements of the complainant
and other witnesses stating that deceased was in love with the
appellant, there is no other material to show that appellant was
maintaining any relation with the deceased. From the material
placed on record it is clear that on the date of incident on
04.05.2018 deceased went to the house of the appellant and
consumed poison by taking out from a smail bottle which he
has carried in his pocket. Merely because he consumed poison
in front of the house of the appellant, that itself will not
indicate any relation of the appellant with the deceased.
‘Abetment’ involves mental process of instigating a person or
intentionally aiding a person in doing of a thing. Without
positive act on the part of the accused to instigate or aid in
committing suicide, no one can be convicted for offence under
Section 306, IPC. To proceed against any person for the
offence under Section 306 IPC it requires an active act or
direct act which led the deceased to commit suicide, seeing no
option and that act must have been intended to push the
deceased into such a position that he committed suicide. There
is nothing on record to show that appellant was maintaining
relation with the deceased and further there is absolutely no
material to allege that appellant abetted for suicide of the
deceased within the meaning of Section 306, IPC. Even with
regard to offence alleged under Section 3(2)(v) of the Act it is
to be noticed that except vague and bald statement that the
appellant and other family members abused deceased by
uttering casteist words but there is nothing on record to show
to attract any of the ingredients for the alleged offence also.
This Court in the case of Chitresh Kumar Chopra v. State
(Govt. of NCT of Delhi) had an occasion to deal with the
aspect of abetment. In the said case this Court has opined that
there should be an intention to provoke, incite or encourage the
doing of an act by the accused. Besides, the judgment also
observed that each person's suicidability pattern is different
from the other and each person has his own idea of self-esteem
and self-respect. In the said judgment it is held that it is
impossible to lay down any straightjacket formula dealing with
the cases of suicide and each case has to be decided on the
basis of its own facts and circumstances. In the case of
Amalendu Pal @ J/hantu v. State of West Bengalé in order to
bring a case within the purview of Section 306, IPC this Court
“12. Thus, this Court has consistently taken the view that
before holding an accused guilty of an offence under
Section 306 IPC, the court must scrupulously examine
the facts and circumstances of the case and also assess
the evidence adduced before it in order to find out
whether the cruelty and harassment meted out to the
victim had left the victim with no other alternative but to
put an end to her life. It is also to be borne in mind that
in cases of alleged abetment of suicide there must be
proof of direct or indirect acts of incitement to the
commission of suicide. Merely on the allegation of
harassment without there being any positive action
proximate to the time of occurrence on the part of the
accused which led or compelled the person to commit
suicide, conviction in terms of Section 306 IPC is not
sustainable.
13. In order to bring a case within the purview of
Section 306 IPC there must be a case of suicide and in
the commission of the said offence, the person who is
said to have abetted the commission of suicide must have
played an active role by an act of instigation or by doing
certain act to facilitate the commission of suicide.
Therefore, the act of abetment by the person charged
with the said offence must be proved and established by
the prosecution before he could be convicted under
10.      In the judgment in the case of S.S. Chheena v. Vijay
Kumar Mahajan this Court reiterated the ingredients of offence
of Section 306 IPC. Paragraph 25 of the judgment reads as
“25. Abetment involves a mental process of instigating a
person or intentionally aiding a person in doing of a
thing. Without a positive act on the part of the accused
to instigate or aid in committing suicide, conviction
cannot be sustained. The intention of the legislature and
the ratio of the cases decided by this Court is clear that
in order to convict a person under Section 306 IPC there
has to be a clear mens rea to commit the offence. It also
requires an active act or direct act which led the
deceased to commit suicide seeing no option and that act
must have been intended to push the deceased into such
a position that he committed suicide.”
11.      In the judgment in the case of Rajiv Thapar v. Madan
Lal Kapur this Court has considered the scope of the provision
under Section 482, Cr.PC and has laid down the steps which
should be followed by the High Court to determine the veracity
of a prayer for quashing of proceedings in exercise of power
under Section 482, Cr.PC. Paragraph 30 containing the four
“30. Based on the factors canvassed in the foregoing
paragraphs, we would delineate the following steps to
determine the veracity of a prayer for quashment raised
by an accused by invoking the power vested in the High
30.1. Step one: whether the material relied upon by the
accused is sound, reasonable, and indubitable i.e. the
material is of sterling and impeccable quality?
30.2. Step two: whether the material relied upon by the
accused would rule out the assertions contained in the
charges levelled against the accused i.e. the material is
sufficient to reject and overrule the factual assertions
contained in the complaint i.e. the material is such as
would persuade a reasonable person to dismiss and
condemn the factual basis of the accusations as false?
30.3. Step three: whether the material relied upon by the
prosecution/complainant; and/or the material is such
that     it cannot    be    justifiably    refuted    by    the
30.4. Step four: whether proceeding with the trial would
result in an abuse of process of the court, and would not
30.5. If the answer to all the steps is in the affirmative,
the judicial conscience of the High Court should
persuade it to quash such criminal proceedings in
exercise of power vested in it under Section 482 CrPC.
Such exercise of power, besides doing justice to the
accused, would save precious court time, which would
otherwise be wasted in holding such a trial (as well as
proceedings arising therefrom) specially when it is clear
that the same would not conclude in the conviction of the
accused.”
12. By applying the aforesaid ratio decided by this Court, we
have carefully scrutinized the material on record and examined
the facts of the case on hand. Except the statement that the
deceased was in relation with the appellant, there is no
material at all to show that appellant was maintaining any
relation with the deceased. In fact, at earlier point of time when
the deceased was stalking the appellant, the appellant along
with her father went to the police station complained about the
calls which were being made by the deceased to the appellant.
Same is evident from the statement of S.1. Manoj Kumar
recorded on 05.07.2018. In his statement recorded he has
clearly deposed that the father along with the appellant went to
the police post and complained against the deceased who was
continuously calling the appellant and Proposing that she
should marry him with a threat that he will die otherwise.
Having regard to such material placed on record and in
absence of any material within the meaning of Section 107 of
IPC, there is absolutely no basis to proceed against the
appellant for the alleged offence under Section 306 IPC and
Section 3(2)(v) of the Act. It would be travesty of justice to
compel the appellant to face a criminal trial without any
credible material whatsoever.”
10.     Therefore, in view of the above position when the medical
officer has not supported the case of the prosecution and has not
found any external injuries which can be caused by kick and fist
blows and more particularly when it is unexplained version of the
complaint that earlier also Rajubhai was tortured by the accused but
Rajubhai has not lodged any complaint but also further unexplained
version of the story of the prosecution that when Sagarbhai
Shamjibhai Chavda had reached S.T. Depot,                        Bagasara and
thereafter the incident was over he met Rajubhai and Rajubhai has
told him about the demand of Rs.500/- and also the threats given by
Pratap @ Tiku Vala to the complainant himself that you go away
from the scene of offence otherwise he will be killed by the accused,
even then though Bagasara Police Station is just to 10 minutes
distance away from S.T. Bus Depot, but they chose not to go to the
police station and lodge the complaint and that conduct is also not
proper and therefore that conduct is also not inspiring any
confidence about the story given by the complainant about the
alleged incident, therefore, on re-appreciation and after going
through the entire record of the case we have found that the
prosecution has failed miserably in proving any ingredients of
Section 306, 323, 504 and 506(2) of the Indian Penal Code
(hereinafter referred to as ‘IPC’ for short) as well as Section 3(1)
(R), 3(1)(S) and 3(2)(5) of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled
Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989 (‘the Act’ for short). As
there is no documentary evidence to establish that the complainant
and the deceased are from the Scheduled Caste/Scheduled Tribes
available on record and the prosecution has also failed to establish
said offence under the Act by leading cogent and convincing
evidence which can be proved beyond reasonable doubt and hence
the Trial Court has righty acquitted the respondents-accused by
giving benefit of doubt, we do not find any illegality or infirmity
with the judgment given by the Trial Court and hence we confirm
the judgment and order passed by the learned trial Court as no other
interference of this Court is required by exercising of power under
Section 378 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973.
11.    It is a cardinal principal of criminal jurisprudence that in an
acquittal appeal if other view is possible, then also the appellate
Court cannot substitute its own view by reversing the acquittal into
conviction, unless the findings of the Trial Court are perverse,
contrary to the material on record, probably wrong, manifestly
erroneous or demonstrably unsustainable. (Ramesh Babulal Doshi
V. State of Gujarat (1996) 9 SCC 225). In the instant case, the
learned APP has not been able to point out to us as to how the
findings recorded by the learned Trial Court are perverse, contrary to
material on record, probably wrong, manifestly erroneous or
demonstrably unsustainable.
12.     In the case of Ram Kumar v. State of Haryana, reported in
AIR 1995 SC 280, Supreme Court has held as under:
“The powers of the High Court in an appeal from order of
acquittal to reassess the evidence and reach its own
conclusions under Sections 378 and 379, Cr.P.C. are as
extensive as in any appeal against the order of conviction. But
as a rule of prudence, it is desirable that the High Court should
give proper weight and consideration to the view of the Trial
Court with regard to the credibility of the witness, the
presumption of innocence in favour of the accused, the right of
the accused to the benefit of any doubt and the slowness of
appellate Court in justifying a finding of fact arrived at by a
Judge who had the advantage of seeing the witness. It is settled
law that if the main grounds on which the lower Court has
based its order acquitting the accused are reasonable and
plausible, and the same cannot entirely and effectively be
dislodged or demolished, the High Court should not disturb the
13.    As observed by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case
of Rajesh Singh & Others vs. State of Uttar Pradesh reported
in (2011) 11 SCC 444 and in the case of Bhaiyamiyan Alias
Jardar Khan and Another vs. State of Madhya Pradesh
reported in (2011) 6 SCC 394, while dealing with the
judgment of acquittal, unless reasoning by the learned Trial
Court is found to be perverse, the acquittal cannot be upset. It
is further observed that High Court's interference in such
appeal in somewhat circumscribed and if the view taken by the
learned Trial Court is possible on the evidence, the High Court
should stay its hands and not interfere in the matter in the
belief that if it had been the Trial Court, it might have taken a
different view.
14.    In the very recent judgment reported in 2021 (15) SCALE Pg.
184 in the case of Mohan @ Srinivas @ Seena @ Tailor Seena V/s.
State of Karnataka, the Hon’ble Apex Court has observed the scope
“Section 378 CrPC enables the State to prefer an appeal
against an order of acquittal. Section 384 CrPC speaks of the
powers that can be exercised by the Appellate Court. When the
trial Court renders its decision by acquitting the accused,
presumption of innocence gathers strength before the
Appellate Court. As a consequence, the onus on the
prosecution becomes more burdensome as there is a double
presumption of innocence. Certainly, the court of first instance
has its own advantages in delivering its verdict, which is to see
the witnesses in person while they depose. The Appellate Court
is expected to involve itself in a deeper, studied scrutiny of not
only the evidence before it, but is duty bound to satisfy itself
whether the decision of the trial Court is both possible and
plausible view. When two views are possible, the one taken by
the trial court in a case of acquittal is to be followed on the
touchstone of liberty along with the advantage of having seen
the witnesses. Article 21 of the Constitution of India also aids
the accused after acquittal in a certain way, though not
absolute. Suffice it is to state that the Appellate Court shall
remind itself of the role required to play, while dealing with a
case of an acquittal.
21. Every case has its own journey towards the truth and it is
the Court’s role undertake. Truth has to be found on the basis
of evidence available before it. There is no room for
subjectivity nor the nature of offence affects its performance.
We have a hierarchy of courts in dealing with cases. An
Appellate Court shall not expect the trial Court to act in a
particular way depending upon the sensitivity of the case.
Rather it should be appreciated if a trial Court decides a case
on its own merits despite its sensitivity.
22. At times, courts do have their constraints. We find,
different decisions being made by different courts, namely,
trial court on the one hand and the Appellate Courts on the
other. If such decisions are made due to institutional
constraints, they do not augur well. The district judiciary is
expected to be the foundational court, and therefore, should
have the freedom of mind to decide a case on its own merit or
else it might become a stereotyped one rendering conviction on
a moral platform. Indictment and condemnation over a
decision rendered, on considering all the materials placed
before it, should be avoided. The Appellate Court is expected to
maintain a degree of caution before making any remark.”
15.    Considering the aforesaid facts and circumstances of the
case and law laid down by the Hon'ble Supreme Court while
considering the scope of appeal under Section 378 of the
Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 no case is made out to
interfere with the impugned judgment and order of acquittal.

present application for leave to appeal being Criminal Misc.
Application No. 20079 of 2021 fails and same deserves to be
dismissed and is accordingly dismissed. In view of dismissal
of the application for leave to appeal, Criminal Appeal No.
1673 of 2021 also deserves to be dismissed and is accordingly
