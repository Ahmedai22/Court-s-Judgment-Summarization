Petitioner a Grama Panchayat Member from a constituency
reserved for Scheduled Tribe has been unseated by the learned II
Addl. Sr. Civil Judge, Shivamogga vide order dated 01.02.2022
(Annexure-A)    in Election    Misc.  No.3/2021  filed by the  1st
respondent- Smt.Abhilasha on the ground of lack of social status.
After service of notice the 1st respondent is represented by a
private advocate.   Official respondents 5 & 6 are represented by
learned AGA and the 7th respondent –State Election Commission is
represented by its Panel Counsel. All the respondents oppose the
writ petition making submission in justification of the impugned
2.     Having heard the learned counsel for the parties and
having perused the petition papers, this Court declines to grant
indulgence in the matter for the following reasons:
(a)   There is no dispute as to petitioner does not belong to
Scheduled Tribe, by birth, although she claims to have acquired
the said social status by marriage to a member of scheduled tribe.
Ordinarily, caste is determined by birth and caste of a person
follows that of his/her father.     That is why Mahabharath states:
“daivaa yatnam kule janma, purushaa yatnam pourusham”. True
it is, in rare circumstances a lady acquires the caste status of her
husband provided she pleads and proves her admission to the
community of the husband by social acceptance. However, that is
not the case put forth by the petitioner in the court below in her
objections to election petition as rightly contended by learned
counsel for the respondent no.1. Such a plea now being taken in
the writ petition is only an after thought and cannot be accepted as
the pleadings in the election petition.
(b)     Learned AGA appearing for the official respondents
vehemently resists the writ petition placing heavy reliance on a
decision of a Co-ordinate Bench in M/S. SHANTHA NAIK VS.
ordinate Judge having surveyed this branch of law has observed
at paragraph 8 & 20 as under:
“8. From the material on record, what is seen is
that the petitioner by birth belongs to Scheduled Caste
and thereafter; on her marriage on 7/9/1993, she
might have been recognised as belonging to the
husband’s family and therefore. Belongs to Scheduled
Tribe community. But What has to be seen in the
instant case is as to whether the petitioner was entitled
to be certified as belonging to Scheduled Tribe and
therefore, which is necessary contest for the post.
20. In the instant case, it is also necessary to
observe that the petitioner belonged to a Scheduled
Caste by birth. Therefore, it is not a case where a
person who belongs to a forward caste sought to
contest the election which was reserved for a
Scheduled Tribe category. Although the petitioner
belong to a Scheduled Caste, it is necessary to note
that the seat was reserved for a Scheduled Tribe
candidate and under the circumstances, it is only a
Scheduled Tribe candidate by birth who could have
contested for the said seat. The reliance placed by the
petitioner on the caste certificate which was issued to
her stating that she belong to Scheduled Tribe could
not have been relied upon by the petitioner in support
of her status as a Scheduled Tribe and the same would
have been useful to her social purpose only. But for
seeking reservation of a seat for the purpose of
election in the instant case or for any benefit under the
Constitution, a person could claim such reservation
only if she is a Scheduled Tribe by birth as in the
present case, the said seat was reserved for Scheduled
Tribe woman.”
(c)    Learned counsel for the petitioner found fault with the
procedure adopted by the Election Tribunal arguing that no fair
opportunity was given to his client.   This is difficult to countenance
inasmuch as petitioner herself had appeared in the matter and
sought time for engaging another advocate, after the first one
retired from the case.    Thrice adjournment was granted and she
concurrently remained absent. Even here no plausible explanation
is offered for such a lapse. Petitioner is an elected representative
of people and not a peasant or a labourer who can seek leniency in
matters like this. This apart, learned AGA is more than justified in
pointing out that in matters pertaining to election, equity and
common law principles have no place vide JYOTHI BASU vs.
DEBI PRASAD GHOSAL, AIR 1982 SC 983 wherein it is observed
“An election petition is not an action at common law, nor an equity.
It is a statutory proceeding to which neither the common law nor
the principles of equity apply but only those rules which the statute
makes and applies”.
In the above circumstances this writ petition being devoid of
merits is liable to be rejected and accordingly it is, costs having
been made easy.
This Court appreciates the valuable assistance rendered by
Sri B.S.Prasad, learned advocate appearing for the 1st respondent
and Sri Nithyananda, learned AGA appearing for respondents nos.
