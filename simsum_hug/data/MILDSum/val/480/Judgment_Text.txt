The prayer in the present petition under Section 439 Cr.P.C is for
the grant of regular bail in case bearing FIR No.26 dated 08.02.2022
(Annexure P-1) registered under Sections 387, 120-B IPC and Sections 25,

2.           The present FIR has been lodged on the statement of Angrej
Singh with the averments that on 28.01.2022 at 6.30 PM, he received a
WhatsApp call on his mobile. The caller disclosed his identity to be Goldy
Brar and demanded a ransom of Rs.1 crore. He showed his inability to make
the payment of the ransom amount and also told the caller that he is busy. The
caller told him to call back. However, he did not call back the caller. On
25.01.2022, again a call was received on WhatsApp. Caller disclosed himself
to be Goldy Brar. He again told the caller that he was busy and would call
him back after some time. On 27.01.2022, he again received a call at 04.00
PM. The caller told him that despite making calls 2-3 times he (complainant)
has not called him (caller) back. He (complainant) was threatened with death.
Thereafter, he told the caller that he would call back after 10 minutes and
accordingly made a call. The caller demanded a ransom of Rs.1 crore. He
(complainant) expressed his inability to make the payment of the said ransom
amount. The caller replied that he (complainant) was a rich man and also
threatened that his children would be kidnapped. On being so threatened, he
offered to pay a ransom amount of Rs.5 lakhs. He was told to pay Rs.25 lakhs
and was directed to make the payment of Rs.10 lakh first and Rs.15 lakhs in
October. He was also told that he would receive another call and a person
would come and receive the money. On 28.02.2022 at 6-7 PM he received a
WhatsApp call from the petitioner-Manjit Singh @ Sonu asking him as to
whether he (complainant) was receiving phone calls from Goldy Brar. He
replied in the affirmative. The petitioner asked him (complainant) to come
and meet him at Panchkula. He went to meet the accused/petitioner at Sector-
20, Panchkula in the presence of Sandres Jamata and Rakesh Kalta. The
petitioner told him that Sampat Nehra was his brother-in-law and that he
(complainant) had committed to make a payment of Rs.25 lakhs and now he
could not retract from the commitment. He showed his inability to make the
payment of said amount. The petitioner told him that he would talk to Sampat
and thereafter he would not receive any call. On 01.02.2022 the
accused/petitioner called him and asked him to come to the office of Sandres
Jamata. He (complainant) was made to talk to Sampat on a video call and was
told to make the payment to the accused/petitioner. The accused/petitioner
and Sandres Jamata requested Sampat that he (complainant) could not make a
payment of Rs.15 lakhs and requested Sampat to receive a sum of Rs.10 lakh.
He (complainant) insisted that he did not have a sum of Rs.10 lakhs and then
was asked to make the payment of any amount he could make. He transferred
a sum of Rs.3 lakhs in the account number provided by the accused Manjit.
He paid a cash of Rs.4 lakhs in cash to the accused in the presence of Sandres
Jamata. On 04.02.2022 the accused Manjit connected him to Goldy Brar
through a video call. He was told that Rs.7 lakhs out of Rs.50 lakhs had been
received and the remaining amount be paid at the earliest. A phone call was
received by him from the accused Manjit Singh asking him not to pick any
phone call. Thereafter a threatening voice message was received from Goldy
Brar. He also stated that he suspected that all this was a ploy of the accused
3.            The learned Senior counsel for the petitioner contends that the
petitioner had never made a demand for any money from the complainant.
The petitioner was trying to help the complainant against the demands made
by Sampat Nehra and Goldy Brar. The petitioner and the complainant had
their offices at Sector 20, Panchkula and it is only out of professional rivalry
that the complainant had falsely implicated the petitioner in this case. The
petitioner had no prior record and merely because he had some association
with Sampat Nehra would not imply his complicity in the illegal and unlawful
activities of the others. Even otherwise, it was highly unlikely that the
petitioner would take the ransom amount in his bank account as per the
allegations of the complainant. The entire case of the prosecution was based
on assumptions and disclosures extracted from the petitioner during the police
remand. Even otherwise, the petitioner had been in custody in since
08.02.2022, the investigation stood completed and since none of the 22
prosecution witnesses had been examined so far, the further incarceration of
the petitioner was not required as the Trial was not likely to be concluded
anytime soon. Even otherwise, the case was triable by the Court of             a
4.            On the other hand, Mr. C.S. Bakshi, Addl. P.P. for U.T.,
Chandigarh contends that the complainant had paid money to the petitioner at
the instance of Sampat Nehra who is a dreaded gangster lodged in jail. The
said Sampat Nehra was the brother-in-law of the petitioner. A sum of money
had also been transferred in the account of the petitioner. One Vishwajeet
alias Vishu had also handed over Rs.3 lakhs to the Investigating Officer on
the ground that he had been handed over the said money by the petitioner. The
petitioner on his arrest got recovered a country-made pistol, 04 live
cartridges, 01 mobile phone and 11 SIM cards. So, considering the nature of
the offence and the mode and manner in which it has been committed along
with the recoveries from the petitioner, the petitioner did not deserve the
concession of bail.
5.            I have heard the learned counsel for both the parties.
6.            Undoubtedly, the allegations against the petitioner are extremely
grave. Offences of this kind are certainly on the rise and must be nipped in the
bud. However, the veracity of the allegations would be a matter of
adjudication during the course of Trial. At this stage, the petitioner is in
custody since 08.02.2022. None of the 22 prosecution witnesses have been
examined so far and therefore, the Trial of the present case is not likely to be
concluded in the near future. Even otherwise, the case is a triable by the Court
of a Magistrate. In such a situation, the further incarceration of the petitioner
is not required.
7.            Thus without commenting on the merits of the case, the present
petition is allowed and the petitioner-Manjit Singh @ Sonu is ordered to be
released on bail subject to his furnishing bail bonds and surety bonds to the
satisfaction of learned CJM/Duty Magistrate, concerned.
8.            The petitioner shall deposit his passport with the Trial Court in
case it has not already been deposited.
9.            The petitioner shall also appear before the police station
concerned on the first Monday of every month till the conclusion of the Trial
and inform in writing each time that he is not involved in any other crime
other than the cases mentioned in this order.
10.           If the petitioner or his family members/associates make any
attempt to contact/threaten/intimidate the witnesses in the present case, the
State would be at liberty to move an application for cancellation of bail
granted vide this order.
10.           In addition, the petitioner (or anyone on his behalf) shall prepare
an FDR in the sum of Rs.5,00,000/- and deposit the same with the Trial Court.
The same would be liable to be forfeited as per law in case of the absence of
the petitioner from trial without sufficient cause.
11.           The petition stands disposed of.
