The Punjab and Haryana High Court last week granted bail to a relative (brother-in-law) of alleged Gangster Sampat Nehra accused of receiving ransom money in his bank account.
Observing that offences of this kind must be nipped in the bud, the bench of Justice Jasjit Singh Bedi, however, went ahead to grant bail in view of the fact that the trial of the case is not likely to be concluded in the near future.
"10. Undoubtedly, the allegations against the petitioner are extremely grave. Offences of this kind are certainly on the rise and must be nipped in the bud. However, the veracity of the allegations would be a matter of adjudication during the course of Trial. At this stage, the petitioner is in custody since 08.02.2022. None of the 22 prosecution witnesses have been examined so far and therefore, the Trial of the present case is not likely to be concluded in the near future. Even otherwise, the case is a triable by the Court of a Magistrate. In such a situation, the further incarceration of the petitioner is not required," the bench remarked.
The case in brief
In this case, the accused/bail applicant was booked under Sections 387, 120-B IPC and Sections 25, 27, 54, 59 of the Arms Act pursuant to an FIR lodged by the statement of Angrej Singh (complainant) alleging that Goldy Brar (an alleged gangster) had been calling him repeatedly demanding a ransom of Rs. 1 crore from him.
He further alleged that he was told that he would receive another call and a person would come and receive the money and thereafter, the accused/petitioner herein called him and told him that the said money was required to be paid to him.
When the complainant expressed his inability to give a ransom of Rs. 25 lakhs, the accused made him talk to alleged gangster Sampat Nehra. Finally, the complainant agreed to give Rs. 7 lakhs and transferred Rs. 3 lakhs in the account number provided by the accused Manjit, and rest 4 lakhs were given to him in cash.
The accused was arrested on February 8, 2022, and he moved to the HC with the instant bail plea arguing that he never made a demand for any money from the complainant and in fact, the petitioner was trying to help the complainant against the demands made by Sampat Nehra and Goldy Brar. 
It was further argued that the complainant had falsely implicated the petitioner in this case and that merely because he had some association with Sampat Nehra would not imply his complicity in the illegal and unlawful activities of the others. 
On the other hand, the counsel for UT Chandigarh argued that the complainant had paid money to the petitioner at the instance of Sampat Nehra who is a dreaded gangster lodged in jail. Further, it was also submitted that the petitioner on his arrest got recovered a country-made pistol, 04 live cartridges, 01 mobile phone, and 11 SIM cards. 
Taking into account the facts and circumstances of the case, the Court that though the allegations are grave, the veracity of the allegations would be a matter of adjudication during the course of the Trial. In view of this, the Court granted him bail.
Appearances: Senior Advocate Bipan Ghai, with Advocates Nikhil Ghai and Nipun Bhardwaj for the petitioner. Mr. C.S. Bakshi, Addl. P.P. appeared for the respondent UT.
