1.    This matter is taken up by virtual/physical mode.
2.    Assailing the Order dated 8th February, 2022 passed by the
Commissioner of CT & GST, Odisha in Revision Case No.
BHU-105/G/2021-22 under Section 80 of the Odisha Goods
and Services Tax Act, 2017 (for short, “the OGST”) read
with Rule 158 of the Odisha Goods and Services Tax Rules,
2017 (for brevity, “the OGST” Rules), directed against the
demand of interest for the periods from April, 2019 to
December,     2019    raised  by    the  CT&GST      Officer,
Bhubaneswar-II Circle, Bhubaneswar for belated deposit of
admitted tax, the petitioner has approached this Court
invoking provisions of Article 226/227 of the Constitution
of India with the following prayers:
“(a) Rule NISI calling upon the Opposite Parties as to
why the impugned Order under Annexure-4 in
absence of any reason, shall not be held to be illegal,
arbitrary and violation of Natural Justice.
(b)     And if they fail to show cause or show insufficient
cause make the Rule absolute.
(c)     Issue a direction to O.P. to rectify the demand raised
vide DRC-07 under Annexure-1.
(d)     And be further pleased to allow the petitioner to pay
the admissible interest amount in 24 installments in
accordance with law.
(e)     Issue any appropriate order/orders deemed fit in the
fact and circumstances of the case.”
3. The case of the petitioner is that in terms of the Section 39
read with Section 59 of the OGST Act, returns for the
period 2019-20 in Form GSTR-3B and GSTR-1 have been
furnished on self-assessment. While undertaking the
scrutiny of said self-assessed returns furnished for each tax
periods as per Section 39, the CT & GST Officer noticed
that the petitioner has filed the returns belatedly.
4. The petitioner has alleged that non-payment of admitted tax
is attributed to non-disbursal of substantial amount standing
due from IDCOL, a Government Agency. It is submitted by
Ms. Kananbala Roy Choudhury, counsel for the petitioner
that as of now, entire tax component stands deposited,
though belatedly. Ms. Roy Choudhury advancing argument
submitted that the petitioner is not in a position to discharge
demand of interest as raised by the CT&GST Organisation
on account of such belated deposit of admitted tax.
Therefore, the petitioner prayed before the Commissioner of
CT&GST, Odisha to allow it to discharge interest demand
to the tune of Rs.68,15,506/- by instalments. The learned
counsel for the petitioner has made submission that the
Commissioner of CT&GST being vested with power under
Section 80 of the OGST Act ought not to have rejected its
application in Form GST DRC-20 filed in consonance with
Rule 158 of the OGST Rules and facilitated the petitioner
by allowing it to discharge the liability towards the huge
burden of interest. It is submitted at the bar that the
rejection of prayer for deposit of interest demand in
instalments by the Commissioner of CT&GST is outcome
of not only arbitrary exercise of power but misreading of
provision of the statute.
5. Per contra, stressing on Annexure-1, i.e., Form GST DRC-
07 issued by the CT&GST Officer, Bhubaneswar-II Circle,
Bhubaneswar, Sri Sidharth Shankar Padhy, learned
Advocate for the CT&GST Organisation submitted that
when the statute requires doing certain things in certain
way, the thing must be done in that way or not at all and,
thereby other methods or modes of performance are
impliedly and necessarily forbidden. Drawing attention of
this Court to the heading “issue involved” appearing in
Form GST DRC-07 (Annexure-1), Sri Padhy further
submitted that, it is explicit from the demand raised by the
CT&GST Officer that “Interest has not been paid on
delayed payment of tax (paid through cash)”. Sri Padhy,
learned Advocate for the CT&GST Organisation referred to
the following as stated at Annexure appended to Form GST
“You are a registered taxpayer under the CGST/OGST Act,
2017 and you have been self-assessed under Section 59 of
the aforesaid Act by filing returns in GSTR-3B and GSTR-1
for the tax period 2019-20 under Section 39 of CGST/OGST
Act, 2017. You are also required to pay interest @18% in
accordance with the provision under Section 50(1) of
OGST/CGST Act or rule made thereunder, if you fail to pay
the tax or any part thereof within the due date of return
filing. However, on the basis of GSTR-3B returns filed by
you, it is noticed that you have filed GSTR-3B returns
belatedly as mentioned below but have not paid the interest
liability, on your own, on the delayed payment of tax
(through cash) which violates the statutory provisions.
Hence, as per your GSTR-3B returns, you have to pay
interest amount of Rs.68,15,506/- ***”
5.1. Sri Padhy also submitted, on instruction, that the
Commissioner of CT&GST has rightly rejected the prayer
of the petitioner inasmuch as the claim is contrary to the
express language of Section 80 of the OGST Act. With
reference to Annexure-2 to the writ petition, i.e.,
Application in Form GST DRC-20 filed before the
Commissioner of CT&GST, it is contended by him that the
rejection of prayer for allowing the petitioner 36 (thirty-six)
instalments is just and proper. The learned Advocate for the
CT&GST Organisation pressed for rejection of the writ
petition by subscribing to the following reason ascribed by
the Commissioner of CT&GST while rejecting the
Application in Form GST DRC-20 vide impugned Order
dated 08.02.2022 (Annexure-4):
“*** Gone through the prayers of the petitioner and order
passed by the forum below. It is noticed that impugned
demand has been raised for belated filing of the returns
which contravenes the provisions under Section 39 of OGST
Act and attract penal action as per provision under Section
50(1) of the said Act. Further Section 80 of the OGST Act
also mandates that on an application filed by a taxable
person, the Commissioner may, for reasons to be recorded
in writing, extend the time for payment or allow payment of
any amount due under this Act, other than the amount due
as per the liability self-assessed in any return, by such
person in monthly instalments not exceeding twenty four,
subject to payment of interest under Section 50 and subject
to such conditions and limitations as may be prescribed.”
[Emphasis supplied]
5.2. It is suggested that the well-reasoned order of the
Commissioner of CT&GST needs no indulgence by this
Court inasmuch as there was no scope or occasion to allow
thirty-six instalments as sought for by the petitioner. Doing
so would be contrary to the statutory mandate.
6.   The issue raised in the present case is:
7. As the period under consideration is April, 2019 to
December, 2019, the provisions for furnishing return under
Section 39, as they existed at the material period, so far as
required for the present purpose, stood as follows:
“39. Furnishing of returns.—
(1)   Every registered person, other than an Input Service
Distributor or a non-resident taxable person or a
person paying tax under the provisions of Section 10
or Section 51 or Section 52 shall, for every calendar
month or part thereof, furnish, in such form, manner
as may be prescribed, a return, electronically, of
inward and outward supplies of goods or services or
both, input tax credit availed, tax payable, tax paid
and such other particulars as may be prescribed on
or before the twentieth day of the month succeeding
such calendar month or part thereof.
(7)   Every registered person, who is required to furnish a
return under sub-section (1) or sub-section (2) or
subsection (3) or sub-section (5), shall pay to the
Government the tax due as per such return not later
than the last date on which he is required to furnish
such return.
(8)    Every registered person who is required to furnish a
return under sub-section (1) or sub-section (2) shall
furnish a return for every tax period whether or not
any supplies of goods or services or both have been
made during such tax period.
(9) Subject to the provisions of Sections 37 and 38, if any
registered person after furnishing a return under sub-
section (1) or sub-section (2), sub-section (3) or sub-
section (4) or sub-section (5) discovers any omission
or incorrect particulars therein, other than as a result
of scrutiny, audit, inspection or enforcement activity by
the tax authorities, he shall rectify such omission or
incorrect particulars in the return to be furnished for
the month or quarter during which such omission or
incorrect particulars are noticed, subject to payment of
interest under this Act:
Provided that no such rectification of any omission or
incorrect particulars shall be allowed after the due
date for furnishing of return for the month of
September or second quarter following or the end of
the financial year, or the actual date of furnishing of
relevant annual return, whichever is earlier.
7.1. Section 50 speaks of interest on delayed payment of tax
which reads as under:
“50. Interest on delayed payment of tax.—
(1)    Every person who is liable to pay tax in accordance
with the provisions of this Act or the rules made
thereunder, but fails to pay the tax or any part
thereof to the Government within the period
prescribed, shall for the period for which the tax or
any part thereof remains unpaid, pay, on his own,
interest at such rate, not exceeding eighteen per
cent., as may be notified by the Government on the
recommendations of the Council.
Provided that the interest on tax payable in respect of
supplies made during a tax period and declared in
the return for the said period furnished after the due
date in accordance with the provisions of Section 39,
except where such return is furnished after
commencement of any proceedings under Section 73
or Section 74 in respect of the said period, shall be
payable on the portion of the tax which is paid by
debiting the electronic cash ledger.
(2)    The interest under sub-section (1) shall be
calculated, in such manner as may be prescribed,
from the day succeeding the day on which such tax
was due to be paid.
(3)    A taxable person who makes an undue or excess
claim of input tax credit under sub-section (10) of
Section 42 or undue or excess reduction in output tax
liability under sub-section (10) of Section 43, shall
pay interest on such undue or excess claim or on
such undue or excess reduction, as the case may be,
at such rate not exceeding twenty-four per cent., as
may be notified by the Government on the
recommendations of the Council.”
7.2. Section 39(7) of OGST Act requires every registered
person, who is required to furnish a return, is to pay to the
Government the tax due as per such return not later than the
last date on which the return is to be furnished. The period
prescribed for payment of tax in respect of every month is
on or before the 20th day of the succeeding calendar month.
However, in case after furnishing return(s), if there is
discovery of any omission or incorrect particulars therein by
the taxpayer, scope is given to rectify in view of Section
39(9), which is subject to payment of interest.
7.3. Section 50 deals with interest on delayed payment of tax
and by virtue of provisions contained therein, a burden is
cast on the taxpayer, who is liable to pay tax, but failed to
pay the same, to pay interest not exceeding 18%. The
liability to pay interest under Section 50(1) is a statutory
obligation which the taxpayer is obligated to comply with
“ON   HIS OWN”   accord. The liability to pay interest under
Section 50, being compensatory for non-deposit of tax
within the stipulated period envisaged under Section 39, is
not penal in nature. Therefore, the petitioner cannot escape
the rigours of liability of interest.
7.4. From sub-section (1) of Section 50, it is manifest that the
liability to pay interest arises automatically, when a person
who is liable to pay tax, fails to pay the tax to the
Government within the period prescribed. The liability to
pay interest arises in respect of the period for which the tax
remains unpaid. In fact, the liability to pay interest under
Section 50(1) arises even without any assessment, as the
person is required to pay such interest “ON HIS OWN”. While
sub-section (1) of Section 50 speaks about the liability to
pay interest under one contingency, viz., the failure to pay
tax within the period prescribed, sub-section (3) thereof
speaks about the liability to pay interest under a different
contingency, i.e., whenever an undue or excess claim of
ITC is made or whenever an undue or excess reduction in
output tax liability is made. The words “ON          HIS OWN”
employed in sub-section (1) of Section 50 are not used in
sub-section (3) of Section 50. Therefore, it is clear that the
liability to pay interest under Section 50(1) is self-
determined and automatic without intervention from
anyone. Apt here to look at the definition of “assessment”
contained in Section 2(11) which inter alia comprehends
“SELF-ASSESSMENT”. When the admitted tax is deposited
belatedly as per the figures disclosed in the returns, interest
component is also to be concomitant with the same and is
required to be deposited on its own computation. Hence, the
liability to pay interest is compensatory in nature.
7.5. When the levy of interest emanates as a statutory
consequence and such liability is a direct consequence of
non-payment of tax, such a levy is different from the levy of
interest which is dependent on the discretion of the
assessing officer. The default arising out of non-payment of
tax on an admitted liability in the case of self-assessment
attracts automatic levy of interest, whereas the default in
filing incomplete and incorrect return attracts best judgment
assessment in which the levy of interest is based on the
adjudication by the assessing officer. Reference be had to
EID Parry (India) Ltd. Vrs. Assistant Commissioner of
7.6. It has been observed in Haji Lal Mohammad Biri Works
Vrs. State of Uttar Pradesh, (1973) 32 STC 496 (SC); and
(1977) 39 STC 36 (SC) that liability to pay interest is
automatic and arises by operation of law. In Commissioner
of Sales Tax Vrs. Qureshi Crucible Centre, (1993) 89 STC
467 (SC) and Commissioner of Trade Tax Vrs. Kanhai Ram
Thekedar, (2005) 141 STC 1 (SC) consistent view has been
expressed to the effect that a dealer shall have to deposit the
tax admittedly payable within the time prescribed under the
statute and if he fails to do so, interest becomes payable.
This levy of interest is by operation of law. It does not
require a separate order as such by any authority.
7.7. In Garg Associates Pvt. Ltd. Vrs. Commissioner of Trade
Tax, (2005) 139 STC 368 (All) referring to J.K. Synthetics
it has been held that the statutory provision authorising the
State or the Revenue to charge interest on delayed payment
of tax must be construed as the substantive law and not
procedural law. Thus, the State Government is empowered
by the Legislature to raise revenue through the mode
prescribed in the Act so that the State should not suffer on
account of delay, caused by the tax-payers in payment of
tax. The interest is payable on the tax admittedly payable
which is due. The purpose of charging interest is to
compensate the revenue for the loss caused to it due to the
late payment. If no loss has been caused to the department
or the revenue as the money was already lying in deposit
with the department earlier, no interest can be charged in
such circumstances, by the department. The condition
precedent for levy of interest under the provisions of the
Act is only if there is default in payment of tax admittedly
due to the department. In Prahlad Rai Vrs. Sales Tax
Officer, (1992) 84 STC 375 (SC) it has been laid down that
accrual of interest is automatic and no separate notice of
demand is necessary.
8. The meaning of “interest” and its purport has been
discussed in State of Karnataka Vrs. Karnataka Pawn
Brokers Association, (2018) 6 SCC 363. The relevant
paragraphs are quoted hereunder:
“29. *** It has been repeatedly held that interest is
basically compensation for the use or retention of
money. In Halsbury’s Laws of England, 4th Edn.,
Vol. 32, “interest” has been defined as follows:
“127. Interest in general.—
Interest is the return or compensation for the
use or retention by one person of a sum of
money belonging to or owed to another.
Interest accrues from day to day even if
payable only at intervals, and is, therefore,
apportionable in respect of time between
persons entitled in succession to the
principal.”
30.   According to Law Lexicon, by P. Ramanathan Aiyar,
“ “Interest” means the time value of the funds or
money involved, which, unless otherwise agreed, is
calculated at the rate and on the basis customarily
accepted by the banking community for the funds of
money involved.”
31.   In Words and Phrases Permanent Edition, Vol. 22 p.
148, “interest” means:
“(i)  “Interest” is compensation for loss of use of
principal. [Jersey City v. Zink, 44 A 2d 825 :
133 NJ Law 437 (1945)], A 2d p. 828”.
(ii)  “Interest” means compensation for the use or
forbearance of money. [Commissioner of
Internal Revenue v. Meyer, 139 F 2d 256 (6th
Cir 1943)], F 2d at p. 259.”
32.   Black’s Law Dictionary, 6th Edn. (p. 812) defines
“For use of money.—
Interest is the compensation allowed by law or fixed
by the parties for the use or forbearance of borrowed
money. [Jones v. Kansas Gas and Electric Company,
222 Kan 390 : 565 P 2d 597 (1977)] , P 2d p. 604.”
33.   There is no manner of doubt that normally a person
would be entitled to interest for the period he is
deprived of the use of money and the same is used by
the person with whom the money is lying. ***”
8.1. This Court in Naili Kanta Muduli Vrs. Bhubaneswar
Development Authority, 2008 (II) OLR 18 (Ori) has
observed that ‘Interest’ means the compensation allowed by
law or fixed on by the parties for the use or forbearance for
borrowed money. In common parlance, it is naive to
mention that a creditor when allows a debtor to use his
money for a period exceeding the date until which, such
credit was given, takes an extra amount is known as
interest.
8.2. “Conventional interest” and “legal interest” have been
explained in Black’s Law Dictionary thus:
Conventional interest:
“Interest at the rate agreed upon and fixed by the parties
themselves, as distinguished from that which the law would
prescribe in the absence of an explicit agreement.”
“A rate of interest fixed by statute as either the maximum
rate of interest permitted to be charged by law, or a rate of
interest to be applied when the parties to a contract intend
an interest to be paid but do not fix the rate in the contract.
Even in the latter case, frequently this rate is the same as
the statutory maximum rate permitted. Term may also be
used to distinguish interest in property or in claim
cognisable at law in contrast to equitable interest.”
8.3. In Pratibha Processors Vrs. Union of India, AIR 1997 SC
138 = (1996) 11 SCC 101, distinction between “tax”,
“interest” and “penalty” has been culled out in the
following manner:
“13. In fiscal statutes, the import of the words— ‘tax’,
‘interest’, ‘penalty’, etc. are well known. They are
different concepts. Tax is the amount payable as a
result of the charging provision. It is a compulsory
exaction of money by a public authority for public
purposes, the payment of which is enforced by law.
Penalty is ordinarily levied on an assessee for some
contumacious conduct or for a deliberate violation of
the provisions of the particular statute. Interest is
compensatory in character and is imposed on an
assessee who has withheld payment of any tax as and
when it is due and payable. The levy of interest is
geared to actual amount of tax withheld and the
extent of the delay in paying the tax on the due date.
Essentially, it is compensatory and different from
penalty — which is penal in character.”
8.4. In Bhai Jaspal Singh Vrs. Assistant Commissioner of
Commercial Taxes, (2010) 35 VST 456 (SC) it is laid down
that interest on failure to pay sales tax before expiry of last
date for filing the return means that the assessee would be
liable to pay interest on the amount of such tax from the
date it was payable, i.e., from the expiry of the last date for
filing returns under the Act. Where the tax due on the basis
of quarterly return is not paid before the expiry of the last
date of filing such return, it is not necessary to issue any
notice of demand, but on the default being committed by
the dealer, he becomes liable to pay interest on the amount
of such tax from the last date of filing quarterly returns
prescribed under the Act.
8.5. In Alok Shanker Pandey Vrs. Union of India, AIR 2007 SC
1198 = (2007) 3 SCC 545 it has been observed as follows:
“9.    It may be mentioned that there is misconception
about interest. Interest is not a penalty or punishment
at all, but it is the normal accretion on capital. For
example if A had to pay B a certain amount, say 10
years ago, but he offers that amount to him today,
then he has pocketed the interest on the principal
amount. Had A paid that amount to B 10 years ago, B
would have invested that amount somewhere and
earned interest thereon, but instead of that A has kept
that amount with himself and earned interest on it for
this period. Hence, equity demands that A should not
only pay back the principal amount but also the
interest thereon to B.”
8.6. In equity, interest may be recovered in certain cases where a
particular relationship exists between the creditor and the
debtor. Interest is also payable where there has been
misconduct or improper delay in payment, or in the case of
money obtained or retained by fraud. It may also be allowed
where the defendant ought to have done something which
would have entitled the plaintiff to interest at common law,
or has wrongfully prevented the plaintiff from doing
something which would have so entitled him. However,
payment of tax is not under a contract between the taxpayer
and the State. There is plain repugnance between contract
and taxation. Taxation is the very antithesis of contract.
8.7. In the present case the admitted tax on self-assessment
being not deposited within the period stipulated, the
petitioner is liable to compensate the State Government by
way of interest which is provided for under the statute.
9.   In Khazan Chand Vrs. State of Jammu & Kashmir, (1984)
56 STC 214 (SC) it has been laid down that payment of
interest in case of default in payment of tax is a means of
compelling the assessee to pay the tax due by the prescribed
date and that it is a mode of recovery of tax and well within
the legislative power of the State. Provisions in that behalf
form part of the recovery machinery provided in a taxing
statute. It is for the State to provide by what means payment
of tax is to be enforced and a person who does not pay the
amount of tax lawfully and admittedly due by him can
hardly complain of the measures adopted by the State to
compel him to pay such amount. It neither lies in the
defaulter’s mouth to protest against the rate of interest
charged to him nor is it open to him to dictate to the State
the methods which it should adopt for recovering the
amount of tax due by him.
9.1. The mode and manner of payment of tax and interest have
been envisaged in Section 49. For better appreciation
provisions of said section are extracted hereunder:
“49. Payment of          tax, interest, penalty    and   other
amounts.—
(1)    Every deposit made towards tax, interest, penalty, fee
or any other amount by a person by internet banking
or by using credit or debit cards or National
Electronic Fund Transfer or Real Time Gross
Settlement or by such other mode and subject to such
conditions and restrictions as may be prescribed,
shall be credited to the electronic cash ledger of such
person to be maintained in such manner as may be
prescribed.
(2) The input tax credit as self-assessed in the return of a
registered person shall be credited to his electronic
credit ledger, in accordance with Section 41, to be
maintained in such manner as may be prescribed.
(3) The amount available in the electronic cash ledger
may be used for making any payment towards tax,
interest, penalty, fees or any other amount payable
under the provisions of this Act or the rules made
thereunder in such manner and subject to such
conditions and within such time as may be
prescribed.
(4) The amount available in the electronic credit ledger
may be used for making any payment towards output
tax under this Act or under the Integrated Goods and
Services Tax Act, 2017 (Act No.13 of 2017) in such
manner and subject to such conditions and within
such time as may be prescribed.
(5) The amount of input tax credit available in the
electronic credit ledger of the registered person on
(a)    integrated tax shall first be utilised towards
payment of integrated tax and the amount
remaining, if any, may be utilised towards the
payment of central tax and State tax, or as the
case may be, Union Territory tax, in that
(b)    the central tax shall first be utilised towards
payment of central tax and the amount
remaining, if any, may be utilised towards the
payment of integrated tax;
(c)    the State tax shall first be utilised towards
payment of State tax and the amount
remaining, if any, may be utilised towards
payment of integrated tax;
(d)    the Union territory tax shall first be utilized
towards payment of Union territory tax and the
amount remaining, if any, may be utilised
towards payment of integrated tax;
(e)    the central tax shall not be utilised towards
payment of State tax or Union territory tax;
(f)    the State tax or Union territory tax shall not be
utilised towards payment of central tax.
(6) The balance in the electronic cash ledger or
electronic credit ledger after payment of tax, interest,
penalty, fee or any other amount payable under this
Act or the rules made thereunder may be refunded in
accordance with the provisions of Section 54.
(7) All liabilities of a taxable person under this Act shall
be recorded and maintained in an electronic liability
register in such manner as may be prescribed.
(8) Every taxable person shall discharge his tax and
other dues under this Act or the rules made
thereunder in the following order, namely:
(a)    self-assessed tax, and other dues related to
returns of previous tax periods;
(b)    self-assessed tax, and other dues related to the
return of the current tax period;
(c)   any other amount payable under this Act or the
rules made thereunder including the demand
determined under Section 73 or Section 74.
(9)    Every person who has paid the tax on goods or
services or both under this Act shall, unless the
contrary is proved by him, be deemed to have passed
on the full incidence of such tax to the recipient of
such goods or services or both.
(a)   the date of credit to the account of the
Government in the authorised bank shall be
deemed to be the date of deposit in the
electronic cash ledger;
(i)  “tax dues” means the tax payable under
this Act and does not include interest, fee
(ii) “other dues” means interest, penalty, fee
or any other amount payable under this
Act or the rules made thereunder.”
9.2. Every taxable person, thus, is required to make a self-
assessment of the tax and to file the return within the time
prescribed. The word ‘prescribed’ has been defined in
Section 2(87) to mean “prescribed by rules made under this
Act on the recommendations of the Council”. The dealer is
bound to file self-assessed return in prescribed form along
with the payment of tax in the manner and within the period
stipulated therein. The date of filing the return and for
making payment varies depending on various factors, the
mode of payment, the nature of the transaction, and the
turnover. Payment of tax due is also to be made within the
period stipulated in the rules from the date of expiry of each
quarter. Therefore, the due date for payment for interest
under the Act to run is not the date of the assessment.
10. The Commissioner of CT&GST having taken into
consideration the analysis made by the Hon’ble Telangana
High Court at Hyderabad, vide Judgment dated 18.04.2019
rendered     in   the   case     of Megha      Engineering     &
Infrastructures Ltd. Vrs. Commissioner of Central Tax, Writ
Petition No.44517 of 2018, has come to the just conclusion.
The Judgment of Single Bench of the Hon’ble Kerala High
Court rendered in the case of Pazhayidom Food Ventures
No. 14275 of 2020 (H), Decided on July 24, 2020 reported
at 2020 SCC OnLine Ker 12929, as referred to by the
petitioner is distinguishable on facts. Material fact on which
the said Court proceeded to allow the petitioner therein to
discharge liability to pay interest on instalment is that:
“4. It is also relevant to note that, as of today, there is no
demand against the petitioner for the unpaid tax
amount.”
Said Court having not discussed the provisions of the GSTT
Act, said Judgment may not have binding precedent to
persuade this court to grant similar relief to the petitioner.
However, in the present case, the petitioner has taken step
by approaching the Commissioner of CT&GST by making
an application in Form GSTR DRC-20 prescribed under
Rule 158 invoking Section 80 after it has received the notice
of demand in Form GST DRC-07. Therefore, this Court is
not inclined to accede to the prayer of the petitioner.
10.1. It is noticed that had the CT&GST Officer, Bhubaneswar-II
Circle, Bhubaneswar not issued demand notice in Form
GST DRC-07 directing the petitioner to deposit interest on
delayed payment, interest to the tune of Rs.68,15,505/-
would have escaped. It is reason best known to the
petitioner as to why after deposit of admitted tax belatedly,
did not deposit the interest component thereon “ON          HIS
OWN”.   Matter would have stood on different footing had the
petitioner sought to deposit interest on its own in view of
requirement under Section 50(1).
10.2. Furthermore, provision of Section 80 apparently restricts
consideration of payment of tax/interest in instalments
where the same emanates from self-assessment. For proper
appreciation it is fruitful to have a glance at the provisions
contained in Section 80 of the OGST Act, which stands as
“On an application filed by a taxable person, the
Commissioner may, for reasons to be recorded in writing,
extend the time for payment or allow payment of any
amount due under this Act, other than the amount due as
per the liability self-assessed in any return, by such person
in monthly installments not exceeding twenty four, subject to
payment of interest under Section 50 and subject to such
conditions and limitations as may be prescribed.
Provided that where there is default in payment of any one
installment on its due date, the whole outstanding balance
payable on such date shall become due and payable
forthwith and shall without any further notice being served
on the person, be liable for recovery.”
[Emphasis supplied]
Corresponding rule is found at Rule 158, which reads thus:
“(1) On an application filed electronically by a taxable
person, in Form GST DRC-20, seeking extension of
time for the payment of taxes or any amount due under
the Act for allowing payment of such taxes or amount
in installments in accordance with the provisions of
Section 80, the Commissioner shall call for a report
from the jurisdictional officer about the financial
ability of the taxable person to pay the said amount.
(2) Upon consideration of the request of the taxable
person and the report of the jurisdictional officer, the
Commissioner may issue an order in Form GST DRC-
21 allowing the taxable person further time to make
payment and/or to pay the amount in such monthly
installments, not exceeding twenty-four, as he may
deem fit.
(3) The facility referred to in sub-rule (2) shall not be
(a) The taxable person has already defaulted on the
payment of any amount under the Act or the Integrated
Goods and Service Tax Act, 2017 or the Union
Territory Gods and Services Tax Act, 2017 or any of
the Central Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017 for
which the recovery process is on;
(b) The taxable person has not been allowed to make
payment in installments in the preceding financial year
under the Act or the Integrated Goods and Services
Tax Act, 2017 or the Union Territory Goods and
Services Tax Act, 2017 or any of the Central Goods
and Services Tax Act, 2017;
(c) The amount for which installment facility is sought is
less than twenty-five thousand rupees.”
10.3. As has been held in Baidyanath Ayurved Bhawan v. Excise
Commissioner, U.P., AIR 1971 SC 378, in interpreting a
taxing statute, the Court should not ordinarily concern
themselves with the policy behind the provisions or even
with its impact. In that case, the Hon’ble Supreme Court of
India referred with approval to the observations made by
Rowlatt, J., in Cape Brandy Syndicate v. Inland Revenue
Commissioners, [1921] 1 KB 64 (at p. 71) which were as
“*** in a taxing Act one has to look at what is clearly said.
There is no room for any intendment. There is no equity
about a tax. There is no presumption as to a tax. Nothing is
to be read in, nothing is to be implied. One can only look
fairly at the language used.”
10.4. Be it noted that individual cases of hardship and injustice do
not and cannot have any bearing for rejecting the natural
construction by attributing normal meanings to the words
used since hard cases do not make bad laws. A fiscal statute
shall have to be interpreted on the basis of the language
used therein and not de hors the same. No words ought to
be added and only the language used ought to be considered
so as to ascertain the proper meaning and intent of the
legislation. The Court is to ascribe the natural and ordinary
meaning to the words used by the Legislature and the Court
ought not, under any circumstances, to substitute its own
impression and ideas in place of the legislative intent as is
available from a plain reading of the statutory provisions.
Reference may be had to Cooke Vrs. Charles A Vogeler
Co. Vrs. Commissioner of Income Tax, (1990) 183 ITR 1
Commissioner of Income Tax, (1999) 4 SCC 197; State of
10.5. In the case of Union of India Vrs. Deoki Nandan Aggarwal, AIR
1992 SC 96, the Supreme Court has observed as follows (para 14,
“It is not the duty of the court either to enlarge the scope of the
legislation or the intention of the Legislature when the language of
the provision is plain and unambiguous. The court cannot rewrite,
recast or reframe the legislation for the very good reason that it
has no power to legislate. The power to legislate has not been
conferred on the courts. The court cannot add words to a statute or
read words into it which are not there. Assuming there is a defect
or an omission in the words used by the Legislature the court could
not go to its aid to correct or make up the deficiency. Courts shall
decide what the law is and not what it should be. The court of
course adopts a construction which will carry out the obvious
intention of the Legislature but could not legislate itself. But to
invoke judicial activism to set at naught legislative judgment is
subversive of the constitutional harmony and comity of
instrumentalities.”
10.6. It is fairly well-settled that statute being an edict of the Legislature,
it is necessary that it is expressed in clear and unambiguous
language. Where, however, the words were clear, there is no
obscurity, there is no ambiguity and the intention of the Legislature
is clearly conveyed, there is no scope for the court to innovate or
take upon itself the task of amending or altering the statutory
provisions. In that situation the judges should not proclaim that
they are playing the role of a lawmaker merely for an exhibition of
judicial valour. They have to remember that there is a line, though
thin, which separates adjudication from legislation. That line
should not be crossed or erased. This can be vouchsafed by “an
alert recognition of the necessity not to cross it and instinctive, as
well as trained reluctance to do so”. (See Frankfurter: “Some
Reflections     on   the    Reading      of   Statutes”    in   Essays   on
Jurisprudence, Columbia Law Review, p. 51 as referred to in A.
Ram Mohan Vrs. State by the Inspector of Police and Others, 2015
2005 SC 648, the Apex Court held that,
“13.     The interpretative function of the court is to discover the
true legislative intent. It is trite that in interpreting a statute
the court must, if the words are clear, plain, unambiguous
and reasonably susceptible to only one meaning, give to the
words that meaning, irrespective of the consequences.
Those words must be expounded in their natural and
ordinary sense. When the language is plain and
unambiguous and admits of only one meaning, no question
of construction of statute arises, for the Act speaks for itself.
Courts are not concerned with the policy involved or that
the results are injurious or otherwise, which may follow
from giving effect to the language used. If the words used
are capable of one construction only then it would not be
open to the courts to adopt any other hypothetical
construction on the ground that such construction is more
consistent with the alleged object and policy of the Act. In
considering whether there is ambiguity, the court must look
at the statute as a whole and consider the appropriateness
of the meaning in a particular context avoiding absurdity
and inconsistencies or unreasonableness which may render
the statute unconstitutional.
14.    It is equally well settled that in interpreting a statute, effort
should be made to give effect to each and every word used
by the legislature. The courts always presume that the
legislature inserted every part thereof for a purpose and the
legislative intention is that every part of the statute should
have effect. A construction which attributes redundancy to
the legislature will not be accepted except for compelling
reasons such as obvious drafting errors. [See State of U.P.
360; Nyadar Singh Vrs. Union of India, (1988) 4 SCC 170
SC 1979; J.K. Cotton Spg. and Wvg. Mills Co. Ltd. Vrs.
State of U.P., AIR 1961 SC 1170; and Ghanshyamdas Vrs.
10.8. Plain reading of the provisions of Section 80 admits of no
ambiguity      that   the    Commissioner        of    CT&GST         is
empowered to allow the payment of “any amount due”
under the Act in monthly instalments not exceeding twenty-
four subject to payment of interest under Section 50 and
also subject to such condition and limitation under Rule
158. One of the conditions is reflected in the said provision
itself, i.e., the instalment cannot be allowed in the
circumstance when the liability to be discharged is on
account of self-assessed returns. Therefore, necessary
corollary would be that the Commissioner of CT&GST is
empowered to invoke Section 80 for allowing taxpayer to
discharge liability in instalment when demand is raised
under the statute. However, the Commissioner of CT&GST
is required to assign reasons in writing for the said purpose.
In other words, it may be stated that this section permits a
taxable person to make payment of an amount due on
instalment basis, other than the amount due as per self-
assessed return. The term ‘instalments’ in general parlance
would mean equated periodical payments (money due)
spread over an agreed period of time. This provision
happens to be a beneficial piece of law to the tax payers to
pay the demand in instalments along with interest.
Nonetheless, as stated earlier, the amount should not be the
amount due as per the liability as self-assessed in any
return. Therefore, the amount which is payable pertains to a
demand notice can be deferred or paid in instalments.
10.9. Section 39 of the OGST/CGST Act specifies time frame
within which returns are to be furnished. Such returns are
considered to be self-assessed returns under Section 59 ibid.
10.10. Section 59 is reproduced herein below:
“Every registered person shall self-assess the taxes payable
under this Act and furnish a return for each tax period as
specified under Section 39.”
11.   It is admitted fact on record that the petitioner has deposited
an amount of tax admitted in self-assessed returns beyond
the time stipulated under Section 39 and hence the CT &
GST Officer, Bhubaneswar-II Circle, Bhubaneswar had
raised demand of interest to the tune of Rs.68,15,506/- vide
GST DRC-07 for the period April 2019 to December 2019.
11.1. Since interest is a part of tax and such tax being belated
payment in respect of self-assessment, Section 80 of the
OGST Act clearly excludes grant of instalment under the
present fact-situation. However, the Commissioner is not
conferred with power to allow such instalment in respect of
amount due as per self-assessment return(s) furnished.
Section 80 empowers the Commissioner to grant permission
only to the taxable person to make payment of any amount
due     on  instalment    basis, on     an   application   filed
electronically in Form GST DRC-20 as prescribed under
Rule 158. The Commissioner after considering the request
by the taxable person in Form GST DRC-20 and report of
the jurisdictional officer, may issue an order in Form GST
DRC-21, allowing the taxable person either extend the time
or allow payment of any amount due under the Act on
instalment basis. This provision, therefore, applies to
amounts due other than the self-assessed liability shown in
any return. The instalment period shall not exceed 24
months. The taxable person shall also be liable to pay
prescribed interest on the amount due from the first day
such tax was due to be payable till the date tax is paid. In
view of proviso to Section 80, if default occurs in payment
of any one instalment, the taxable person would be required
to pay the whole outstanding balance payable on such date
of default itself without further notice. There was, therefore,
no scope for the Commissioner of CT&GST to entertain
application for grant of instalment.
12.   In view of the above discussion, the Commissioner of
CT&GST is justified in rejecting the prayer of the petitioner
to deposit the interest levied on account of belated deposit
of admitted tax as per self-assessed returns furnished in
terms of Section 39 read with Section 59 of the
CGST/OGST Act in instalment under Section 80 read with
Rule 158. The writ petition, thus, being devoid of any merit,
is dismissed.
