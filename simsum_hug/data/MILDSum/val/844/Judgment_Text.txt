1.       The appellant/husband preferred this appeal under Section 19 of
Family Courts Act, 1984 to quash and set aside the judgment dated
10.08.2021 passed by learned Principal Judge, Family Court, South District,
Saket Courts, Delhi in HMA No. 388 of 2011 titled as Smt. Preeti Sharma
Vs Sh. Sunil Kumar Sharma. The Family Court granted divorce by the
impugned judgment in favour of the respondent/wife under Section 13(1)(ia)
of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 (hereinafter referred as HMA).
2.       The necessary facts giving rise to the present appeal are that the
marriage between the appellant and the respondent was solemnized on
MAT.APP. (F.C.) No. 116/2021                                             Page 1 of 22
22.05.1997 as per the Hindu rites and ceremonies at respondent’s father’s
house in New Delhi. The parties cohabited as husband and wife, and two
daughters were born out of the wedlock.
3.             Soon after the marriage, the relationship between the couple turned
sour. Marital differences cropped up between the parties and the divorce
petition was preferred by the respondent on grounds of continuous acts of
cruelty inflicted by the appellant upon the respondent. The Family Court
allowed the divorce petition against the appellant by the impugned
judgment.
4.             The appellant in the present appeal alleges that the Family Court has
erred in striking out the defence of the appellant, and not allowing the
appellant to lead his defence evidence, and granted divorce by relying on the
allegations of the respondent, which are contrary to submissions on record.
5.             The issues which require adjudication in this case are as follows:
(i)            Whether the Family Court was right in striking off the defence of the
(ii)           Whether the respondent/wife was able to prove the charge of cruelty
with cogent evidence against the appellant/husband before the Family
6.             The appellant and the respondent appeared before us, and we
interacted with them, with a view to explore the possibility of reconciliation.
The parties agreed to appear before the Delhi High Court Mediation and
Conciliation Centre to settle their dispute with regard to the alimony and
maintenance for both the daughters. However, the parties could not reach to
a settlement, and the matter was referred back to the court. Accordingly, we
heard the submissions of the parties on merits and reserved judgment.
MAT.APP. (F.C.) No. 116/2021                                                  Page 2 of 22
7.       After the relations between the parties soured, the respondent wife
initiated a proceeding under Section 12 of the Protection of Woman against
Domestic Violence Act, 2005 (hereinafter referred to as DV Act), which is
pending adjudication before learned MM, Saket Courts, South District,
Delhi. It is submitted by the learned counsel for the respondent that due to
societal pressure, it took so long for the respondent to take the first step and
file the said case.          In the aforesaid case, vide order dated 15.04.2010, the
learned MM granted interim relief to the respondent and directed the
appellant to leave the shared household and refrain from visiting the school
of the children. Hence, on 18.04.2010, the appellant left the house of the
petitioner/respondent and till date they have been living separately. The
submission of the respondent is that the said order was passed, after the
learned MM was satisfied that the respondent was subjected to cruelty by
the appellant. Thereafter, the appellant preferred an appeal against the
aforesaid order, which was dismissed vide order dated 27.08.2015 by the
learned ASJ, Saket Courts, Delhi. The respondent, thus submits, that the
finding of cruelty against the appellant stood affirmed and became final. As
a counter blast to the case under DV Act, the appellant also filed a complaint
against the respondent and her father.
8.       The respondent then filed the divorce petition based on the order
dated 15.04.2010 of the learned MM on the prima facie findings of cruelty
meted out by the appellant.
9.       The appellant denied the allegations of the respondent. He claimed
that the respondent harassed the appellant mentally and physically, and, in
fact, appellant helped the respondent overcome her family’s debt, and
always took care of all the expenditures, and has been a doting father. He
MAT.APP. (F.C.) No. 116/2021                                               Page 3 of 22
claimed that the respondent is obsessed with her colleague, who is also a
Radha Swami follower, and the allegations of the respondent are only aimed
to remove the appellant from the family, and deprive the daughters of the
love of their father.
10.            It appears that an application was filed before the Family Court by the
appellant for grant of 8 weeks’ time to file his evidentiary affidavit, which
was dismissed by the Family Court vide order dated 13.07.2021. The Family
Court then proceeded to adjudicate the matter in the absence of any defence
evidence of the appellant. The appellant has challenged the judgment of the
Family Court on the grounds that the Family Court did not allow the
appellant to lead his evidence and decided the petition without giving him
any opportunity to defend his case. He submits that serious injustice has
been caused to him by not allowing him to submit his evidentiary affidavit,
and striking off his defence vide order dated 23.07.2021.
11.            The learned counsel for the appellant further submitted that Family
Court was wrong in dismissing the application of the appellant for grant of 8
weeks to file his evidentiary affidavit along with relevant documents. He
submits that the Family Court is obligated to allow all evidence, irrespective
of it being admissible or relevant; it is the duty of the family court under
Section 14 of the Family Court Act, 1984 to admit all documents and decide
the admissibility or relevance of those documents while adjudicating the
matter before it. Learned counsel for the appellant relied on decision of
learned Single Judges in Deepali Santosh Lokhande v. Santosh Vasantrao
Lokhande, (2018) 1 Mah LJ 944 (Bom) and Deepti Kapur v. Kunal, AIR
12.            The learned counsel for the appellant further submitted that the
MAT.APP. (F.C.) No. 116/2021                                                 Page 4 of 22
Family Court granted divorce to the respondent on false allegation raised by
the respondent, solely relying on the submissions of the respondent. It is
further submitted that the allegations of cruelty levelled against him by the
respondent could not have been established from the pleadings or evidence
on record.
13.      On the other hand, learned counsel for the respondent submitted that
the respondent filed her evidentiary affidavit in the divorce petition,
whereafter she was cross-examined by the counsel for the appellant. The
respondent closed her evidence in the affirmative on 26.06.2021. The
Family Court on 13.07.2021, granted 3 days time to the appellant to file his
evidentiary affidavit, which was challenged by the appellant before this
Court in CM (M) No. 436/2021. This court on 15.07.2021, directed the
Family Court to adjudicate the divorce petition, and the connected
maintenance petition on merits before 14.08.2021, and time granted to the
appellant for filing his affidavit was extended by 10 days. The appellant
challenged the said order before the Supreme Court by filing SLP (Civil)
No. 11118/2021, which was dismissed as withdrawn. The appellant failed to
file his evidentiary affidavit within the time granted by this court vide order
dated 15.07.2021. Later, his defence was also struck off by the Family Court
for repeated non-compliance of orders. In the aforesaid background, the
appellant’s written statement was perused by the Family Court before
pronouncing the judgment.
14.      We have considered the submissions of the learned counsels for the
appellant and the respondent, and we have gone through the impugned
judgment and documents placed on record.
15.      First and foremost, it is pertinent to mention here that while rejecting
MAT.APP. (F.C.) No. 116/2021                                            Page 5 of 22
the plea of the appellant by order dated 13.07.2021, the Family Court
observed that the fresh documents cannot be filed at the stage of evidence
and are required to be filed along with the reply or written statement, “One
party cannot file fresh documents on basis of the cross-examination of the
opposite party”. The appellant challenged the aforesaid order before this
Court without success, and later, before the Supreme Court, which petition
was dismissed as withdrawn. The appellant was granted time to file his
evidentiary affidavit, and only his plea to file additional documents was
rejected, but the appellant failed to file his evidentiary affidavit within time.
16.            Order 8 Rule 1A (1) of Civil Procedure Code, 1908 (hereinafter
referred to as CPC) mandates the defendant to file the documents in his
possession at the time of filing the written statement. In case the defendant
fails to file such documents at the time of presenting the written statement,
then the same shall not be allowed to be received in evidence on behalf of
the defendant. Filing of additional documents by the defendant can be
permitted only with the leave of the court.
17.            Section 14 of the Family Courts Act, 1984 empowers the Family
Court to receive any evidence, whether or not the same is relevant or
admissible under the Indian Evidence Act if, in its opinion the same would
assist it to deal effectually with the dispute before it. However, the Family
Court is deemed to be a Civil Court and provisions of CPC apply to the
proceedings before it by virtue of Section 10 of the Family Courts Act.
Section 14 cannot be read as an exemption from the application of Order 8
Rule 1A (i) of the CPC. The issue before the Family Court was not about
the admissibility of the documents, but about the belated stage at which the
appellant sought to bring the same on record.
MAT.APP. (F.C.) No. 116/2021                                             Page 6 of 22
18.      A bare perusal of the order dated 23.07.2021 shows that the appellant
preferred an appeal before this Court, against the order of the learned MM in
Domestic Violence case for payment of maintenance to the respondent. On
31.10.2018, this Court directed the appellant to pay the arrears within six
months, over and above the monthly allowances, on or before 15.11.2018.
The appellant filed Crl. M.C. 4816/2015 before this Court, for extension of
time to comply with the aforesaid order. On 03.05.2019, the said petition
was dismissed and no extension of time was granted. Thereafter, the
appellant challenged the said order before the Supreme Court in SLP No.
4980/2019. The same was dismissed vide order dated30.05.2019, wherein,
the Court observed: “Having heard the learned counsel appearing on behalf
of petitioner and upon perusal of the record, no case is made out to interfere
in view of the specific undertaking given by the petitioner. Hence, the
special leave petition is dismissed”, although the Court extended the period
for three months i.e. 30.08.2019, for payment of the maintenance amount.
The appellant again approached this court to extend time to pay Rs. 1 lakh.
He was directed to pay Rs. 25000 by 30.06.2021, and remaining amount
within three weeks, which the appellant did not pay. This Court vide order
dated 11.05.2021 in CM (M) 368/2021, gave him last and final opportunity
to pay the amount, failing which, the court decided to proceed on merits.
The appellant failed to comply with various orders of this Court, as well of
the Supreme Court, and the Family Court qua payment of the maintenance
and preferred to indulge in frivolous litigations instead of paying the
outstanding maintenance amount. The appellant was directed by this court to
deposit the maintenance amount, failing which the appellant shall bear the
consequences. Instead of the paying the maintenance on time, the appellant
MAT.APP. (F.C.) No. 116/2021                                          Page 7 of 22
preferred to repeatedly flout the directions of this Court. Hence, we are of
the view that the Family Court was justified in striking off the defence of the
appellant. The appellant was very well aware of the consequences of his
actions.
19.            The Family Court in its order dated 04.08.2021, observed as follows :
“14. The contention of Ld. Counsel for the respondent that
order dated 23.7.2021 passed by this Court is liable to be
reviewed as alleged non-compliance of High Court orders was
not an issue on the said date before this court, is without any
merit. It is for this Court to see on every date that the orders of
this court and the High Courts are complied with in letter and
spirit. In case unscrupulous litigants are allowed to violate the
orders of the court, people will lose faith in the courts of justice
and jungle raj will prevail. It is the bounden duty of every Court
to see that the majesty of the court is not lowered. The orders
passed by the High Court of Delhi/Apex Court must be treated
by every litigant with utmost respect and be complied with in its
letter and spirit but in the present case respondent has
repeatedly overlooked and neglected the compliance of the said
orders and has treated them as something written on an
ordinary piece of paper.
16. From March 2021 till date the respondent had preferred 10
petitions i.e. CM(M)-280/21, CM(M)-281/21 CM(M)-368/21,
436/21, TP(CRL)-40/2021 and TP (CRL)-37/2021, Crl M.C.
1725/2021 and 3-4 Miscellaneous Applications before the High
Court of Delhi, various applications before this Court as well.
He had filed one Miscellaneous Application and 2 Petitions
before the Apex Court. This clearly shows that the Respondent
is not having any financial crunch as all the petitions preferred
by him only shows that he is in habit of luxurious litigations
instead of paying the maintenance of his own daughters, while
claiming that he is poor and ex-serviceman.”
MAT.APP. (F.C.) No. 116/2021                                                    Page 8 of 22
20.      The conduct of the appellant clearly shows that the appellant
deliberately and intentionally did not abide by the orders of the Supreme
Court, this Court and the Family Court. At various instances, the appellant
undertook to make the payment and the dates were extended with his
consent, but he disobeyed the orders. Number of opportunities were given to
the appellant. However, it appears that the intentions of the appellant was
not clean from the beginning. Even after number of directions of the Courts,
the appellant casually filed petitions, without following any of the
directions.
21.      In this regard, reference may be made to Bimal Chand Jain v. Sri
GopalAgarwal, (1981) 3 SCC 486, wherein the Supreme Court – while
deciding an appeal where the defence of the appellant was struck off for
default in making payment under Rule 5 of Order 15, inter alia, held as
“6. ………..Sub-rule (2) obliges the court, before making an
order for striking off the defence to consider any representation
made by the defendant in that behalf. In other words, the
defendant has been vested with a statutory right to make a
representation to the court must consider it on its merits, and
then decide whether the defence should or should not be struck
off. This is a right expressly vested in the defendant and enables
him to show by bringing material on the record that he has not
been guilty of the default alleged or if the default has occurred
there is good reason for it. Now, it is not impossible that the
record may contain such material already. In that event, can it
be said that sub-rule (1) obliges the court to strike off the
defence? We must remember that an order under sub-rule (1)
striking off the defence is in the nature of a penalty. A serious
responsibility rests on the court in the matter and the power is
not to be exercised mechanically. There is a reserve of
discretion vested in the court entitling it not to strike off the
MAT.APP. (F.C.) No. 116/2021                                            Page 9 of 22
defence if on the facts and circumstances already existing on
the record it finds good reason for not doing so. It will always
be a matter for the judgment of the court to decide whether on
the material before it, notwithstanding the absence of a
representation under sub-rule (2), the defence should or should
not be struck off.”
22.            Reference may also be made to M/s Babbar Sewing Machine Co. v.
Triloknath Mahajan, (1978) 4 SCC 188. In this case, the Supreme Court,
while dealing with Order 11 Rule 21 CPC, considered the effect of non-
compliance of order for discovery, and observed:
"25. ...….. A perusal of Order XI, Rule 21 shows that where a
defence is to be struck off in the circumstances mentioned
therein, the order would be that the defendant „be placed in the
same position as if he has not defended‟. This indicates that
once the defence is struck off under Order XI, Rule 21, the
position would be as if the defendant had not defended and
accordingly the suit would proceed ex parte. In Sangram Singh
v. Election Tribunal1 it was held that if the court proceeds ex
parte against the defendant under Order IX, Rule 6(a), the
defendant is still entitled to cross-examine the witnesses
examined by the plaintiff........"
23.            The Supreme Court in Modula India v. Kamakshya Singh Deo,
(1988) 4 SCC 619, while dealing with the appeal, where the defence of
tenant was struck off against delivery of possession under West Bengal
Premises Tenancy Act,1956, inter alia, observed:
"24. …..,even in a case where the defence against delivery of
possession of a tenant is struck off under Section 17(4) of the
Act, the defendant, subject to the exercise of an appropriate
discretion by the court on the facts of a particular case, would
generally be entitled:
(a) to cross-examine the plaintiff's witnesses; and
(b) to address argument on the basis of the plaintiff's case.
We would like to make it clear that the defendant would not be
entitled to lead any evidence of his own nor can his cross-
examination be permitted to travel beyond the very limited
objective of pointing out the falsity or weaknesses of the
plaintiff's case. In no circumstances should the cross-
examination be permitted to travel beyond this legitimate scope
and to convert itself virtually into a presentation of the
defendant's case either directly or in the form of suggestions put
to the plaintiff's witnesses."
24.      A Division Bench of this Court applied the ratio of the decision of
Modula India (supra) in Kulbhushan Seth v. Seema Seth &Ors., ILR
(2008) 2 Del 698. The defence of the appellant was struck off by the learned
Single Judge because the appellant failed to file an affidavit disclosing his
gross salary in petition for maintenance by the respondent. After referring to
the above extract from Modula India (supra), the Division Bench held as
"5. A perusal of the above judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme
Court makes it clear that the right of the defendant in such a
situation is to cross-examine the plaintiff's witnesses and to
address arguments on the basis of the plaintiff's case. It has
also been held that in no circumstances the cross-examination
can be permitted to travel beyond the legitimate scope and to
convert itself virtually to a presentation of the defendant's case
either directly or in the form of suggestions put to the plaintiff's
witnesses. In our view, this itself shows that the judgment of the
Hon'ble Supreme Court does not support the plea advanced by
the learned Counsel for the appellant and on the contrary
supports the stand of the respondent that the appellant's written
statement cannot be taken in account. Accordingly, there is no
merit in the appeal".
25.            For the above reasons, we are of the view that the Family Court was
right in striking off the defence of the appellant qua non-payment of the
maintenance, after number of opportunities were given by various Courts.
Since, the evidentiary affidavit or additional documents that the appellant
wishes to place on record could not have been relied upon by the Family
Court, the dismissal of application to file evidentiary affidavit does not
prejudice any right of the appellant. A perusal of the impugned judgment
shows that the Family Court relied upon the written statement of the
appellant. The appellant cross examined the respondent. Since the defence
of the appellant was struck off, he was not allowed to lead his evidence or
file additional documents, representing his case, directly or indirectly.
26.            Secondly, the learned counsel for the appellant submitted that the
Family Court relied on serious allegation of sexual weakness/ impotency,
which was not even proved, in spite of the appellant having two daughters.
Upon perusal of the pleadings and evidence, we find that the respondent in
her cross examination was suggested on behalf of the learned counsel for the
appellant that she made false allegation, that the appellant is suffering from
sexual weakness. This was denied by the respondent. The learned counsel
for the appellant further asked the respondent to explain the sexual weakness
suffered by the appellant. The respondent answered that she was informed
by the appellant about his sexual weakness when they were not able to
consummate the marriage for approximately a week. The respondent has
reiterated the same in her pleadings, that the appellant suffered from sexual
weakness, for that reason the marriage was consummated at a much later
date. However, as submitted by the appellant, the allegation of impotency
against the appellant, has no basis. Pertinently, there has been no mention of
MAT.APP. (F.C.) No. 116/2021                                             Page 12 of 22
the word „impotency‟ in the divorce petition, or the impugned judgment of
the Family Court.
27.      The learned counsel for the appellant in the cross-examination of the
respondent suggested that she made false allegation that the appellant was
impotent. This was also denied by the respondent. It appears that the
contention of sexual weakness was not pressed by the respondent, and the
Family Court did not rely on the said ground to grant divorce. No finding in
this regard has been returned by the Family Court against the appellant.
Thus, the aforesaid contention of the appellant cannot be a ground to set
aside the judgment of the Family Court.
28.      The appellant has not disclosed any reason, or pointed out any
contradictions in the respondent’s testimony, which could create a
reasonable doubt in our mind to disbelieve the testimony of the respondent.
The appellant did not file any evidence to support his grounds or prove the
contrary. It is pertinent to mention that the respondent in her cross
examination, by the learned counsel for the appellant, did not falter and
withstood her testimony, which has also been appreciated by the Family
Court in the impugned judgment. The Family Court was also of the view
that respondent proved that the conduct of the appellant amounted to cruelty
within the parameters of Section 13(1)(ia) of the HMA and the relevant
paragraphs from the impugned judgment read as follows:
“29. I find the testimony of PW-1 reliable and trustworthy. Her
testimony could not be shaken in the cross examination
conducted on behalf of the respondent. Respondent subjected
the petitioner and the children with immense cruelty and
deprived them for the natural love affection. He neglected his
matrimonial obligations and harassed the petitioner to such an
extent that finally she had to approach the Court of law for
MAT.APP. (F.C.) No. 116/2021                                         Page 13 of 22
redressal for her grievances. The petitioner has narrated
several incidents of cruelty and has relied upon documents to
prove the same. Being fed up of the cruelties subjected by the
respondent petitioner filed under D.V. Act in the Court of the
l.d. M.M. Interim relief was granted to the petitioner vide order
dated 13.04.2010 (ex. PW 1/G) where upon respondent vacated
the matrimonial house at Lodhi Road on 18.04.2010. It also
stands proved that petitioner took financial assistance from her
father/relatives to repay respondent‟s debts and rent of the
house. The respondent forced the petitioner to shift 6 houses as
he was always in the search of a house for which he had to pay
less rent. Such an attitude of the respondent brought humiliated
to the petitioner. When the petitioner got a promotion as
Program Executive, she was not allowed to go Barelly, U.P.
The petitioner and her daughter were not taken care of by the
respondent when they were not well. The petitioner was
defamed by the respondent by alleging that she was a
characterless lady and he further taunted that both the
daughters are not his daughters and DNA test should be
conducted. He threatened the petitioner not to divorce her and
raised a demand of Rs. 50 lakhs for giving divorce. He used to
call the petitioner and her daughters as lesbians as they used to
sleep together. He used to call the petitioner Chudail and
Bhootani. To take care of her daughters, the petitioner had to
often take leave from her department and she has proved
documents in this respect as Ex. PW1/F. The petitioner has
relied upon the Resume dated 01.04.2009 of the respondent
(Ex. PW/F.) wherein respondent has given details of his 10
years professional carrier in private security from 1999 till
2009. In the cross examination of the respondent when he was
asked about his professional and educational qualification till
date, he deposed that he is a graduate and a diploma holder in
electrical Engineering. It appears that he deliberately did not
disclose his other qualifications as in response to question no.
3, he stated as under :-
(Professional/Qualification) apart from the above mentioned
MAT.APP. (F.C.) No. 116/2021                                                 Page 14 of 22
ones? If yes, kindly provide the details of the same.
Ans. During pre-release courses in the year 1992, I underwent
the training in Diploma Course and Computer and Tours and
Travel Agency management Course.”
30. Thus it stands proved that the respondent is a professionally
qualified person and was in business. He was discharged on
31.08.1992 from Indian Air Force as a Sergeant. He has
admitted that from 2000 to 2009, he was a partner in Vigil
Services with Lt. Col. V.K. Sharma. He has admitted that ITRs
were filled by him after year 2000. In response to a question as
to why he has not filed ITRs, he replied that owing to his
engagement in his younger brother‟s murder case, he could not
do so. The respondent is contesting the cases filed by the
petition with full vigour and has filed multiple petitions up to
the Apex Court. The conduct of the respondent shows that he
tried to evade filing of the ITRs in order to conceal his true
income from this Court. Thus, an adverse inference is to be
drawn against him for not filing the ITRs. He has admitted in
his cross examination that since 2009 till April 2020, he had
been a part time consultant in Lucknow and Jhansi and the
income is already mentioned in his ITRs. He has not disclosed
the names of the companies and the places where he worked on
the ground that there is an oral non-disclosure agreement and
for the said reason, the names cannot be shared. The plea taken
by the respondent is not believable at all. The respondent has
deliberately not shared the details of the companies in which he
worked from 2009 till April 2020 to conceal his true income.
31. He has also invested money which stands proved vide
receipt (EX.PW 1/I) with Ambey Car Rental Pvt. Ltd. The
petitioner          had also  booked      plots    with   several
developers/builders. He purchased a WagonR Car in the year
32. PW-2 Mr. Harsh has proved the income details of the
respondent since 201-16 till 2020-21 vide letter dated
08.07.2021 Ex. PW 2/I. For the AYs-2016-21, total income of
the respondent as per ITR was Rs.2,68,500/-, Rs.4,65,850/-,
Rs.5,22,490, Rs.6,74,600/- and Rs.5,24,690/- respectively. As
per Ex. PW 2/2, amounts of Rs.63592/-, Rs.1417/-, Rs.152129/-
MAT.APP. (F.C.) No. 116/2021                                          Page 15 of 22
and Rs. 192478/- were deducted under Chapter V-A for the
year 2017-2021. It appears that for these years certain
investments were made by the respondent.”
29.            Thus, the respondent proved her ground that the appellant is earning
handsomely, and deliberately did not provide for the family and is now
avoiding paying the maintenance, by relying on the ITR details of the
appellant for the assessment years 2015-2021, and receipts from Ambey Car
Rental Services Pvt. Ltd. However, the appellant could not prove that he was
bearing the expenditure of the family or, as submitted by him, got expensive
gifts for the respondent. The averment of the appellant that he was only
getting pension and had no other source of income was disproved by
testimony of the Tax Assistant from Income Tax department as PW-2. This
shows that the appellant is not interested in taking responsibility of his
daughters and contributing towards the family expenses. This itself would
have caused considerable trauma and harassment to the respondent, who was
single handedly shouldering the responsibility of bringing up two daughters,
without any financial or emotional support from their father. Hence, we do
not agree with this submission of the appellant that the respondent had not
substantiated her ground of cruelty before the Family Court.
30.            In A. Jayachandra versus AneelKaur (2005) 2 SCC 22, the Supreme
Court has held that the cruelty can be physical as well as mental. The Court,
inter alia, observed:
“10. The expression “cruelty” has not been defined in the Act.
Cruelty can be physical or mental. Cruelty which is a ground
for dissolution of marriage may be defined as wilful and
unjustified conduct of such character as to cause danger to life,
limb or health, bodily or mental, or as to give rise to a
reasonable apprehension of such a danger. The question of
MAT.APP. (F.C.) No. 116/2021                                               Page 16 of 22
mental cruelty has to be considered in the light of the norms of
marital ties of the particular society to which they live. Cruelty,
as noted above, includes mental cruelty, which falls within the
purview of a matrimonial wrong. Cruelty need not be physical.
If from the conduct of the spouse same is established and/or an
inference can be legitimately drawn that the treatment of the
spouse, about his or her mental welfare then this conduct
amounts to cruelty. In a delicate human relationship like
matrimony, one has to see the probabilities of the case. The
concept, proof beyond the shadow of doubt, is to be applied to
criminal trials and not to civil matters and certainly not to
matters of such delicate personal relationship as those of
husband and wife. Therefore, one has to see what are the
probabilities in a case and legal cruelty has to be found out, not
merely as a matter of fact, but as the effect on the mind of the
complainant spouse because of the acts or omissions of the
other. Cruelty may be physical or corporeal or may be mental.
In physical cruelty, there can be tangible and direct evidence,
but in the case of mental cruelty there may not at the same time
be direct evidence. In cases where there is no direct evidence,
courts are required to probe into the mental process and mental
effect of incidents that are brought out on evidence. It is in this
view that one has to consider the evidence in matrimonial
disputes.”
31.      In V. Bhagat v. D. Bhagat, (1994) 1 SCC 337, the Supreme Court
was dealing with the divorce petition filed by husband which he amended
later from adultery to cruelty. The Court observed, as follows:
“16. Mental cruelty in Section 13(1)(i-a) can broadly be
defined as that conduct which inflicts upon the other party such
mental pain and suffering as would make it not possible for that
party to live with the other. In other words, mental cruelty must
be of such a nature that the parties cannot reasonably be
expected to live together. The situation must be such that the
wronged party cannot reasonably be asked to put up with such
conduct and continue to live with the other party. It is not
MAT.APP. (F.C.) No. 116/2021                                            Page 17 of 22
necessary to prove that the mental cruelty is such as to cause
injury to the health of the petitioner. While arriving at such
conclusion, regard must be had to the social status, educational
level of the parties, the society they move in, the possibility or
otherwise of the parties ever living together in case they are
already living apart and all other relevant facts and
circumstances which it is neither possible nor desirable to set
out exhaustively. What is cruelty in one case may not amount to
cruelty in another case. It is a matter to be Determined in each
case having regard to the facts and circumstances of that case.
If it is a case of accusations and allegations, regard must also
be had to the context in which they were made.”
32.            The Family Court granted divorce to the respondent under Section
13(1)(ia) of the HMA solely relying on ground of „mental cruelty‟. The
Family Court considered the said aspect in the impugned judgment as
“36. All the suggestions put to PW1 regarding the defence of
the respondent have been denied by her. Mental cruelty and its
effect cannot be stated with arithmetical accuracy. It varies
from individual to individual, from society to society and also
depends on the status of the persons. What would be mental
cruelty in the life of two individuals belonging to a particular
stratum of the society my not amount to mental cruelty in
respect of another couple belonging to a different stratum of
society…….”
The Family Court also relied on the judgment of this Court in Hema v.
Harish Aggarwal, MAT APP (FC) 249/2019, decided on 27.9.2019,
wherein the Court held the following:
“Ever since the decision in Dr. N.G. Dastane v. Mrs. S.
Dastane, reported as Air 1975 SC 1534, courts have
consistently held that that the inquiry required to be conducted
has to be as to whether the conduct of a spouse alleged as
MAT.APP. (F.C.) No. 116/2021                                                  Page 18 of 22
cruelty, is of such a character as to cause a reasonable
apprehension in the mind of the petitioner that it would be
harmful or injurious for him to continue living with the
respondent. The courts are not dealing with ideal husbands and
wives, but disputant couples. Cruelty would always depend
upon the social background of the parties, their way of life,
relationship, temperament and emotions. We are of the opinion
that in the present case, the conduct of the appellant that in the
present case, the conduct of the appellant/wife has been
disclosed to be of such a quality, magnitude and impact as to
have caused mental pain, agony and suffering to the
respondent/husband on a regular and continuous basis, which
clearly amounts to cruelty. The learned Family Court had
rightly granted a decree of divorce in favour of the
respondent/husband.” (emphasis supplied)
33.      Husband and wife are two pillars of the family. Together they can
deal with any situation, balancing the family in all circumstances. If one
pillar gets weak or breaks, the whole house crashes down. The pillars can
withstand all the abuses together, the moment one pillar gets weak or
deteriorates, it becomes difficult to hold the house together. When one pillar
gives up, and puts all the burden on the other pillar, then it cannot be
expected that one pillar will single handedly hold the house together.
34.      As noticed above, we find no reason to differ with the view expressed
by the learned Principal Judge Family Court. The appellant had put the
entire burden on the respondent to manage the house, her job, and to look
after the children. The appellant did not take any responsibility and, on the
other hand, continuously abused the respondent and insulted her and her
family members. The appellant even disrespected her father, and doubted
the respondent’s character. The appellant demanded money to give divorce
to the respondent. He failed to discharge his duties as a husband – and
MAT.APP. (F.C.) No. 116/2021                                           Page 19 of 22
especially as a father. Even after directions of this Court and the Family
Court, the appellant falsified about his earnings and failed to pay the
maintenance for his daughters. Prima facie, the allegation of domestic
violence had been proved and learned MM granted interim relief to the
respondent.
35.            In A. Jayachandra versus AneelKaur (2005) 2 SCC 22 (supra) the
court has also stated that “Mental cruelty may consist of verbal abuses and
insults by using filthy language leading to constant disturbance of mental
peace of the other party.” The aforementioned circumstances, clearly lead to
mental cruelty. No direct evidence is required, the trauma and mental
suffering undergone by the respondent, and attitude of the appellant towards
his family, evidently show that the appellant has caused mental cruelty to the
appellant.
36.            The Supreme Court in Sivasankaran v. Santhimeenal, 2021 SCC
OnLine SC 702, held that where the Court is convinced that the marriage
has broken irretrievably and there are no chances of marriage surviving, the
Court may exercise its power and dissolve the marriage. This Court in
Laxmi v. Kanhaiya Lal, MAT.APP.(F.C.) 5/2020, held as follows:
“23. When the marriage sours, the vows that the couple takes at
the time of marriage are a casualty. We take it that neither of
the parties to a marriage enters into the matrimonial bond, only
to break it later. For the said bond to breach, there are bound
to be some underlying reasons. In some cases, those reasons
may come to the surface and the court may be able to see them.
In others, they may remain latent for myriad reasons. Those
reasons would, invariably, be attributable to both the parties,
as it takes two to fight. And when the fight goes to the point of
them filing cases against each other, the situation becomes
messy and bitter for both of them. Unless the situation is
MAT.APP. (F.C.) No. 116/2021                                                Page 20 of 22
diffused early and the parties decide to reconcile and call a
truce, with passage of time, the void between them only
increases, and the feeling of love and warmth in their
relationship begins to fade. What is left is only a feeling of hurt,
hatred, disrespect, disregard and bitterness for the other. These
negative feelings and thoughts are bound to give rise to mental
trauma, harassment and cause immense cruelty to one-if not
both the parties. It is well known and medically established that
constant feeling of sorrow, hatred, stress, pain, hurt-and the
like, do also manifest in the form of serious diseases such as
heart diseases, diabetes, cancer, etc. [The same has been a
point of study in an article by Timothy W. Smith and Brian R.
W. Baucom, wherein it was stated that quality of intimate
relationships matters as “strain and disruption are associated
with increased risk” (of coronary heart disease)]1 . The data
from NCRB suggests that there are more suicides resulting
from unsettled marital disputes, compared to those resulting
from divorce. In our view, there is no reason, not to recognize
this as cruelty, entitling the court to pass a decree of divorce on
the ground of cruelty.”
37.      In the present case, even though the parties have been married for
nearly 24 years, they have not spent major part together as husband and
wife. They separated on 13.04.2010, and have not lived together since. The
bond between the parties has irretrievably broken down and the respondent
was subjected to repeated harassment at the hands of the appellant, making it
impossible to reconcile their differences. We are, therefore of the view, that
the respondent has well established the ground of mental cruelty by the
appellant, in the light of Samar Ghosh v. Jaya Ghosh, (2007) 4 SCC 511.
38.      The learned counsel for the appellant has requested to modify the
decree of divorce dated 10.08.2021 passed in favour of the respondent under
Section 13(1)(ia) of the HMA, into a decree of divorce by way of mutual
MAT.APP. (F.C.) No. 116/2021                                             Page 21 of 22
consent under Section 13B of the HMA. The respondent has not consented
to divorce by mutual consent. For this reason, we cannot grant divorce by
mutual consent to the parties.
39.            For all the aforesaid reasons, we do not find ourselves inclined to
grant the appellant’s prayer against the dissolution of marriage and find no
infirmity in the impugned judgment of the learned Family Court dated
10.08.2021. Accordingly, the present appeal is dismissed.
