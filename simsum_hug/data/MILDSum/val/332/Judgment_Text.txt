1            By this interim application, the applicants (applicants Nos.
1 and 2 are the daughter and daughter-in-law of deceased Govind
Pansare) seek the following reliefs :
“b. The further investigation to identify masterminds as
well as shooters of Comrade Govind Pansare under
Criminal Case No. 39 of 2015 may please be transferred
form the Respondent SIT to the Maharashtra ATS with
c. The Investigation as to identify masterminds may be
handed over to dedicated team of ATS Maharashtra;
d. The Hon’ble Court may please direct the SIT
Maharashtra as well as the CBI to provide all necessary
cooperation to the Maharashtra ATS for the necessary
hand-over of the Criminal Case No.39 of 2015”.
2           Learned counsel for the applicants submits that this Court
has been monitoring the investigation of the murder of Comrade
Pansare in the aforesaid petition, being Writ Petition No. 3512/2015,
and, that the police have been filing reports with respect to the
investigation carried out by them, from time to time. He submits that
several orders have been passed by this Court since 2015 till date. He
submits that as far as Comrade Pansare’s case is concerned, till date,
the shooters in the said case have not been arrested, much less the
masterminds.
3           The principal ground for seeking transfer of the case, from
Special Investigating Team (`SIT’) which is presently conducting the
investigation, to Anti-Terrorist Squad (`ATS’), Maharashtra, is, that the
real break-through in all the four murder cases i.e. in the murder cases
of Dr. Dabholkar, Comrade Govind Pansare, Dr. M.M. Kalburgi and
Gauri Lankesh, came when ATS, Maharashtra investigated the
Nallasopara Bomb Blast case in 2019. He submits that although, the
Central Bureau of Investigation (`CBI’) had named Sarang Akolkar
and Vinay Pawar (also alleged shooters in the present case) as accused
in Dr. Dabholkar case, however, had subsequently dropped their
names, at the time of filing of the supplementary charge-sheet on 13 th
February 2019, as it had transpired that two of the accused arrested in
the Nallasopara case i.e. Sharad Kalaskar and Sachin Andhure, were
infact the alleged shooters in Dr. Dabholkar case. He further submits
that the ATS charge-sheet filed in the Nallasopara’s case on 18 th
February 2019 reveals the gravity of all the four cases i.e. Comrade
Pansare, Dr. Dabholkar, Prof. Kalburgi and Gauri Lankesh and that the
accused arrested in all the four cases as well as in the Nallasopara
Bomb Blast case are front-line accused. He further submits that there
exists a common sophisticated network of criminals and organization
behind the four murders. In order to place on record, the gravity of
the situation in all the four cases, learned counsel relied on an extract
from the charge-sheet titled as “ दहशतवादी टोळीचे उददषे” (Objectives
of the Terrorist Groups).    He further submits that in the Nallasopara
case, large number of country-made bombs, gelatin sticks, electronic,
non-electronic detonators, gun powder, chemicals, etc. were seized and
that the investigation in the said case revealed, that after committing
the murders of four rationalists, the mastermind were planning to
plant bombs at the Sunburn Festival in December 2017 in Pune.
According to the learned counsel, the charge-sheet in the Nallasopara
case further reveals that the accused had conducted a recce of the said
place (where the Sun Burn festival was to be held) and that before the
event, two days training was provided for making bombs. Learned
counsel submits that the investigation also revealed that two Bengali
speaking trainers had given training to make bombs, however, the plan
was dropped, as some of the accused came in front of the cameras.
The trainers were, however, not arrested.
4           Mr. Nevagi submits that all the five charge-sheets i.e. in the
murder cases of     Dr. Dabholkar,    Comrade Pansare, Dr. Kalburgi,
Gauri Lankesh and Nallasopara Bomb Blast case, reveal that the
offences are interconnected and that the same weapons were used in
the murders of Dr. Dabholkar, Comrade Pansare, Dr. Kalburgi and
5           Learned counsel for the applicants submits that although
Comrade Pansare was killed on February 16, 2015, even after more
than seven years, the SIT has failed to bring in any clear and clinching
breakthrough in the said case. He submits that whereas, a serious
breakthrough showing connection between all the said cases was
unearthed due to the efforts of the ATS, Maharashtra in the
Nallasopara Bomb Blast case. He submits that the Nallasopara case
reveals a larger conspiracy, pursuant to which, the respective State
Governments provided protection to the people named in the hit-list
and that the said intellectuals, including the applicants have been
provided with security, and, that the level of security of the applicants
was further enhanced, pursuant to the said information/disclosure.
The grievance of the applicants is that despite efforts of SIT, the
officers are unable to reach the mastermind behind the said five cases,
much less, the shooters.
6            Learned counsel for the applicants submits that          the
accused in the Nallasopara Bomb Blast case were found to be the
shooters in Dr. Dabholkar’s case i.e. Sharad Kalaskar and Sachin
Andhure. He submits that initially the very same accused i.e. Sharad
Kalaskar and Sachin Andhure were named as witnesses in the present
case i.e. in Comrade Pansare’s murder case, and later, after their arrest
in the Nallasopara case, they were dropped as witnesses by SIT.
7            According to the learned counsel for the applicants, the
investigation conducted by SIT has not made any headway, despite
several orders being passed by this Court, from time to time. The
grievance of the applicants also is that not only the shooters but even
the mastermind in the said case have not been traced till date and
hence, the investigation ought to be transferred to the ATS, so as to
enable them to not only to trace the shooters, but also the mastermind
in the said case.
8            Mr. Nevagi, learned counsel for the applicants further
submits that in order to identify the mastermind, special skills and
investigation is required. He submits that the ATS, Maharashtra had
cracked the Nallasopara Bomb Blast case and it is only pursuant to
their investigation, that the shooters in Dr. Dabholkar’s case were
identified. He submits that the investigation can be transferred to ATS
and continued, without disturbing the present status of the pending
case.
9            Mr. Mundargi, learned senior counsel and Special Public
Prosecutor appearing for the respondent-State, on 1 st August 2022,
had tendered a letter dated 25 th July 2022 sent to the Special Public
Prosecutor by Mr. Retesh Kumaarr, Addl. DGP, CID, Maharashtra
State, Pune. He submits that the SIT has no objection for transferring
of the investigation to the ATS on the request of the applicants, if the
High Court so desires.      Today, Mr. Mundargi reiterates the said
position. He further submits that some members of the SIT can join
the ATS team, so that, there is continuity in the investigation.
10          Perused the application and heard learned counsel for the
respective parties on the application seeking transfer of investigation
from the respondent-SIT to the ATS, Maharashtra.
11          A few facts are as under:
On 20th August 2013, Dr. Narendra Dabholkar was shot
dead at Pune by motorcycle borne assailants; on 20 th February 2015,
Comrade Govind Pansare was shot dead; and on 30 th August 2015,
Professor Kalburgi was shot dead at Dharwad, Karnataka. On 14 th
December 2015, SIT (Additional S.P., Kolhapur) filed charge-sheet as
against Sameer Gaikwad in the trial Court at Kolhapur for the alleged
offences punishable under Sections 120-B, 302, 307 r/w 34 of the
Indian Penal Code (`IPC’) and Sections 3 r/w 25 and Section 5 r/w
Section 27 of the Arms Act, in the Comrade Pansare’s case. On 10 th
June 2016 Dr. Virendra Tawde was arrested by CBI in connection with
the Dr. Dabholkar murder case.       After investigation, the CBI filed
charge-sheet in the said case on 6 th September 2016 as against Dr.
Tawde for the alleged offences punishable under Sections 120-B r/w
302 of the IPC. On 29th November 2016, SIT (Addl. S.P, Kolhapur)
filed supplementary charge-sheet as against some of the accused in
Comrade Pansare’s case. On 5th September 2017, Gauri Lankesh was
murdered in Bengaluru. It appears that in March 2018, the wife of
Professor Kalburgi filed a petition in the Apex Court for constitution
of a dedicated SIT for investigating the murder case of Professor
Kalburgi. It appears that in the said petition, National Investigating
Agency (`NIA’) had filed counter affidavit dated 8 th March 2018, inter
alia, stating therein, that the absconding accused-Sarang Akolkar and
Vinay Pawar (alleged shooters in Comrade Pansare’s case) were also
involved in the Goa Bomb Blast case and are not traceable. In August
2018, ATS, Maharashtra registered C.R. No. 11/2018 in Nallasopara
case. The offences alleged were under Sections 4 and 5 of the
Explosive Substance Act, provisions under the Unlawful Activities
(Prevention) Act and the Arms Act. Three accused were arrested in the
said case by the ATS, including Sharad Kalaskar, who were allegedly
planning terror plots in Mumbai, Satara and Solapur.           On 11 th
February 2019, SIT (Addl. S.P., Kolhapur) filed supplementary charge-
sheet as against Sameer Gaikwad, Virendra Tawde, Amol Kale,
Vasudev Suryawanshi, etc. On 13 th February 2019, CBI also filed a
supplementary charge-sheet as against Virendra Tawde, Sachin
Andhure and Sharad Kalaskar. On 18th February 2019, ATS,
Maharashtra filed charge-sheet in the Nallasopara case and 12 persons
were named in the said case.
12           The applicant Nos. 1 and 2 have filed the aforesaid writ
petition in 2015, seeking for a writ or direction in the nature of
Mandamus to the respondent No.1-State of Maharashtra for
appointing an independent Special Investigating Team led by the
Additional Director General of Police, Maharashtra, comprising of
officers of the ranks of Inspector General of Police, Deputy Inspector
General of Police, Superintendent of Police and other senior officers,
to conduct the investigation into the conspiracy of the gruesome
murder of Comrade Pansare at Kolhapur. It is also prayed that the
investigation carried out by SIT be monitored by this Court till the
time, investigation reaches its logical conclusion. It is also prayed that
the respondent be directed to submit status report as to the progress of
the investigation made in the said case.
13          As far as Comrade Pansare’s murder case is concerned, SIT
was formed consisting of six persons under the leadership of Mr.
Sanjay Kumar, ADG, CID, Crime, Pune. Periodically, status reports
were filed by SIT in sealed envelopes in this court. This Court
(Coram : S.C. Dharmadhikari & Shalini Phansalkar-Joshi, JJ.) vide
order dated 3rd May 2016, had observed that “…… if we do not find a
real headway, we would be constrained to summon high level officials
of both investigating agencies to Court and on the next occasion. We
are hopeful that these officers personally monitor and avoid such a
situation.”    It was also observed that “We are expecting the
investigating agencies to now, at least, show us a real and concrete
progress.”
14           Vide order dated 4th August 2019, this Court (Coram :
S.C. Dharmadhikari & Shalini Phansalkar-Joshi, JJ.) had observed that
SIT would be continuing with the investigation of Comrade Pansare’s
case and it was noted that the SIT is expected not to make any change
or make any alteration in the composition of the SIT, without
obtaining leave of the Court. Vide the said order, the SIT was also
directed to expedite the process.
15           Again, vide order dated 29th September 2016, this Court
(Coram : S.C. Dharmadhikari & B. P. Colabawalla, JJ.) noted that it
was expected that an early conclusion to the investigations would be
arrived at, given that the crimes have been committed long back. It
was also noted that there is alleged common thread or link in two or
three crimes and, therefore, the nexus has to be probed and established
fully, that does not mean that the investigations can go on endlessly.
16           Again, vide order dated 23rd November 2016, this Court
(Coram : S.C. Dharmadhikari & B. P. Colabawalla, JJ.) observed, after
perusing the status report submitted by the SIT, that they were
dissatisfied with the contents of the same. It was further observed that
the guilty should be brought to book expeditiously so as to prevent
attacks on social workers, writers, thinkers, rationalists and liberal
minded people in all walks of life. Certain observations were made in
the said order, which the central agencies were expected to be mindful
17           Vide order dated 17th March 2017, this Court (Coram:
S.C. Dharmadhikari & B.P. Colabawalla, JJ.) observed as under :
“4.       ……… We expect that something would
emerge from the ongoing joint efforts, particularly, in
the light of the directions issued by us today. If nothing
emerges, then, we would be constrained to pass such
further orders and directions, as are permissible in
law…...”
Vide the said order, this Court recorded the statement of
Mr. Mundargi on instruction, that the agencies would concentrate and
devote their time essentially on these investigations.
Dangre, JJ.) again, in its order dated 7th December 2017, observed in
“3.      During the course of hearing, we have
impressed upon both the agencies, through learned
special senior counsel Mr. Mundargi and learned
Additional Solicitor General Mr. Singh, that those
guiding and directing their officials, the superiors to
them in the hierarchy and to whom the investigating
officials are reporting should now take a lead. The
court is anxious and now getting a feeling of being
not assisted properly in taking cognizance of the
grievances of the family members of the deceased as
also the general public.
In para 6, it is noted that the learned Special P.P. stated that
a meeting would be convened with the superior officials at the level of
the Secretary in the Department of Home, Government of
Maharashtra and the Director General of Police and equally the Joint
Director in the CBI and that after such a meeting, it is expected that
the court will find a definite progress and advancement towards
concluding the investigations and apprehending the absconding
accused.
Dangre, JJ.) again, vide order dated 19th April 2018, observed in para
“3.       With the assistance of both senior counsel,
we have perused these reports and which indicate
that sincere efforts are being made by the teams of
officials under the supervision of competent seniors.
However, at some stage, it is admitted that the police
machinery has not been able to reach the absconding
accused, though off and on they are getting
information that they have been seen in some parts of
India and particularly in northeastern states. The
teams have rushed to such sites, but for want of
adequate assistance at the ground level, were not able
to nab and apprehend these absconding accused. The
only manner of tracking and reaching them is
through the mobile phone towers. There are certain
mobile numbers and once used by the accused or
presently, there are mobile numbers made available
and used by their near and dear relatives with whom
they are establishing contacts, but not regularly and
on occasions. Based on the vigil maintained and the
checks and restrictions imposed, the call data records
in relation to these mobile numbers of the relatives
have been made available.
constrained to summon these officials, as named
above, entirely at their cost and consequences. We
give a final opportunity to the investigation teams to
proceed and carry out the investigation so as to reach
the absconding accused.”
20          Vide some of the orders, the officers were also asked to
remain present personally, during the course of the hearing.
21          Again, vide order dated 6th September 2018, this Court
(Coram: S.C. Dharmadhikari & B.P. Colabawalla, JJ.), in paras 5 and
6, observed as under :
“5       We have also perused the report tendered by
Mr. Mundargi who says that insofar as the
investigations in Comrade Govind Pansare murder
case, the SIT is closely monitoring the matter. If there
is an involvement of those who are arrested in the
case of Dr. Dabholkar's murder, then, after the CBI
completes the procedural aspects and particularly
after obtaining custody of the persons named as
accused, the SIT will take any decision and prompt
steps. The SIT wants to investigate whether there is
any common link and whether the same persons are
involved. Since the investigations are at a crucial
stage, Mr. Mundargi says that it will not be possible to
divulge anything further. At the same time, he assures
the Court that independent of this, the SIT will
continue its probe and investigation.
6       Both have assured this Court that the steps
and measures taken in the past have not been
abandoned nor any final opinion is expressed with
regard to involvement of other persons in the crime.”
22           Vide order dated 10th October 2018, this Court (Coram:
S.C.Dharmadhikari & B.P.Colabawalla, JJ.), after perusing the report,
tendered by Mr. Mundargi, observed thus :
“7.      On perusal of the report tendered by Mr.
Mundargi, we inquired when the further steps in
relation to the investigations in the murder of
Comrade Govind Pansare wold be taken and on
instructions, Mr. Mundargi states that after the
custody of certain persons is obtained, the
investigations would take further shape and he says
that the Special Investigation Team hopes to conclude
them expeditiously.”
It appears that during the proceedings, some of the accused
arrested in Gauri Lankesh’s case were found to be involved in the
murder of Comrade Govind Pansare and as such, the said accused
were also arrested in the said case. It appears that as far as absconding
accused were concerned, it was submitted that all efforts were being
taken to apprehend them.
23           Again, this Court (Coram: S.C. Dharmadhikari & B.P.
Colabawalla, JJ.), vide order dated 14th March 2019 was constrained
to observe in para 5, as under :
“5.       As far as the report placed by Mrs.Deshmukh
with regard to the investigations in the other crime
(murder of Comrade Govind Pansare), we do not find
any attempts being made by the State police to nab
the absconding accused. The same old story is
repeated in this report and we are sorry to say, it is
nothing but an eye wash. By the methodology
adopted, the absconding accused are not going to be
arrested and for years together. By now, these accused
are sufficiently aware of the fact or are made aware of
it, that it is this Court which is monitoring the
investigations and calls for the report of the same. If
the details about the absconding accused are
continuously highlighted by the Special Investigation
Team (SIT), then, such accused are not expected to
reside in the State or in the vicinity of the crime spot.
If the crime is committed in the State of Maharashtra
and not far away from the city of Pune, then, merely
because one of the absconding accused owns
immovable property in Pune, he is not worried to
such an extent that he would visit Pune frequently.
Secondly, such persons do not have a secured job.
Thirdly, they are already uprooted and are away from
the family and at times disowned by the family
members after indulging in such acts. Therefore, they
are bound to seek shelter anywhere and everywhere
and this is a huge country, thickly populated and one
can easily, by modern means of transport, reach the
boundaries of India on all sides. We have also found
that at times, impression is given to the investigating
officials that these accused are somewhere near the
scene of the crime, they are being given shelter very
near to it, but the investigating agencies are unaware
of it. If the investigation team visits the places near
the scene of the crime, they are then misled and
return clueless. The accused have already left that
place or have never visited it after the commission of
the crime. Thereafter, if nothing has been done or the
investigating machinery only acts at intervals or when
reminded of their duty by the Court, then, such
absconding accused and those shielding them are
emboldened to move the accused to their
acquaintances for harbouring such criminals and
accused. It is not impossible in this country to obtain
identification proof and by changing a name,
designation and place of residence. In such
circumstances, we do not think that this report can be
accepted. While we discard it, we do wish to express
our strong displeasure with harsh remarks for we have
given enough opportunities to the concerned officials
to show their bona fides.”
24          Again, in the order dated 28th March 2019, this Court
(Coram: S.C. Dharmadhikari & B.P. Colabawalla, JJ.) has observed in
paras 4, 5, 6 and 8 as under :
“4.      Mr. Mundargi, learned Senior Counsel,
appearing on behalf of the investigating team
investigating the murder of Comrade Govind Pansare
would submit that after the last hearing at least two
steps have been taken. Firstly, the number of officials
or members of the investigating team has now been
increased. The restructuring of the team is done.
Earlier there was a problem because of shortage of
manpower and staff but thereafter the services of
additional officers are made available. The time that
was consumed in preparing and filing charge-sheets
has admittedly taken its toll. Mr. Mundargi admits
that during that period and time attempts to trace the
absconding accused and apprehend them could not be
made. That was on account of time constraints for
presenting the charge-sheets. The officials were
engaged and busy in performing that duty. Now that
the charge-sheets have been laid in the Competent
Criminal Courts, the officials, as also the added ones,
will fully devote their time and attention and then this
Court will see some concrete changes in the next few
months. The composition of the team will not be
altered unless and until the State informs this Court
and takes its permission. Mr. Mundargi submits that
some harsh remarks and critical observations have
been made in the earlier order but the State would
like to give one more opportunity to the investigating
officer Mr. Tirupati Kakade. He is a dedicated official
and fully devotes himself in performing his duty. He
performs it sincerely and honestly. Let him be given
an opportunity to complete the job or the task
assigned to him.
5.       We indicated to Mr. Mundargi that we are
not personally against any official nor we derive any
pleasure in making critical comments, much less
scathing one. It is only to impress upon the officials
who are present in the Court that it is their duty to
protect and safeguard everybody, including those who
are propounding extreme views and opinions. The
State is duty bound to protect everyone and till now
everybody was speaking and expressing oneself very
fearlessly but now at least some of them are scared.
They fear for their lives. Those committing such
ghastly crimes and the institutions and persons behind
them ought to realise that tomorrow it may be their
turn. Ultimately, extremists and those terrorising
others alone go and eliminate their opponents. The
opponents of such persons may then resort to similar
means. However, violence is not the answer. Violence
only breeds violence. If peace and law and order are
to prevail, then, every crime against the society and
committed in such ghastly manner, as is projected
before us, should be investigated and the guilty have
to be brought to book. This is the prime duty of the
State and it must assure every resident that none will
be victimised hereafter. A chilling message has to be
sent to the perpetrators of the crime and wherever
they are hiding.
6.        The second development that Mr. Mundargi
informs us is about the enhancement in the quantum
of the reward. It is now enhanced to Rs.50,00,000/
(Rupees Fifty Lakhs) and if any person gives
information about the absconding accused, he would
be duly rewarded. We impressed upon Mr. Mundargi
that it is the duty of the investigating officials to nab
the accused, even if he is absconding. It is they who
must reach him/her and make every attempt to reach
the accused wherever he or she is hiding. The State
cannot entirely depend upon residents or citizens of
this country to give them clues or information about
the absconding accused. The State officials should not
be so naive and ignorant and ought to realise that
people who harbour criminals or shield or protect
them otherwise get much more in return than what is
offered by the State. Possibly some of them may be
gaining everyday and every month by shielding and
protecting the accused or by misleading the
investigating machinery with regard to their
whereabouts. Therefore this development can hardly
be termed as positive. Rather, it is an admission of the
inept handling and tardy and slow pace of the
investigation. This is hardly a development worth
noting and by this Court.”
“8.      We hope and trust that during the time that is
sought from the Court something worth noting will
occur, this Court would be informed and would be
kept posted about the attempts made to nab and
arrest the absconding accused. The further reports of
the team should be placed on record by both the CBI
as also the Special Investigation Team (SIT).”
25          Vide order dated 26th April 2019, this Court (Coram: S.C.
Dharmadhikari & B.P .Colabawalla, JJ.) observed in paras 9 to 11 as
“9.       We expect all concerned now to render the
requisite assistance to the investigating machineries
both, at the Central and the State level.
10.       The Government of Maharashtra must realise
that when a crime of this nature was committed in the
adjoining State, namely, in the State of Karnataka
(murder of Gauri Lankesh), the functionaries and
officials in-charge of maintenance of law and order in
that State acted swiftly and without any intervention
of the court. Nobody was required to file any legal
proceedings, much less a Public Interest Litigation so
as to ensure investigation, interrogation and arrest of
the accused. In fact, the police machinery in that State
arrested some of the accused involved in the murder
of Gauri Lankesh from the State of Maharashtra. We
think that lessons have to be learnt by our machinery
and there is nothing wrong in even now improving the
state of affairs in this State.
11.       We do not think that the State functionaries
expect orders and directions from the court to
investigate crimes and to bring the guilty to book. We
are informed by Mr.Mundargi that insofar as the
investigation in the crime (murder of Comrade Govind
Pansare), the Additional Chief Secretary, Home and
the Director General of Police, State of Maharashtra
are jointly supervising and monitoring the operations.
The Additional manpower deployed by the
Government of Maharashtra, through this Department
of Home, has now taken over the investigation. The
officers are posted at specific locations and after the
clues are received about the absconding accused,
definite strategies have been evolved and put in place
and the assurance is that this court would see a
positive result by the next date.”
26          Similarly, this Court (Coram: S.C. Dharmadhikari & G.S.
Patel, JJ.), vide order dated 14th June 2019, in paras 14 to 16,
“14.     In so far as the Comrade Govind Pansare
murder case is concerned, the report is taken on
record, but we find that the prosecution in that case is
resting only on the revelations made by the accused in
two other murder cases. It may be that there is a
common thread flowing in the three to four crimes
across Maharashtra and Karnataka. However, there
are peculiarities of every murder case. That element
cannot be excluded from consideration in the manner
suggested in this report. Therefore, the Special
Investigation Team (SIT) in the Comrade Govind
Pansare murder case would have to make independent
efforts to bring all the guilty persons in that crime to
book. They cannot only rest on the statements of
arrested accused and the witnesses in the two other
murder cases.
15.      It is stated that the two absconding accused
could not be traced despite serious efforts. We do not
think that announcing rewards and prizes and taking a
police officer or official all over India would result in
the apprehension and nabbing of the absconding
accused. We only remind the Chief Secretary and
Executive that this is not the way in which the crime
as serious as the murder of Comrade Govind Pansare
ought to be investigated and tried. It is the reputation,
image and prestige of the investigating agencies in the
State of Maharashtra which is at stake. If the Chief
Secretary, Additional Chief Secretary (Home) and the
Principal Secretary in that Department, the Director
General of Police and senior officials are not
concerned about all this, then, we do not know how
they will ever impress upon their subordinates the
seriousness of a fair and complete investigation. Their
investigating skills are put to test in such crime and it
is only when every suspect becomes an accused and
every accused is tried that the police machinery will
come out with flying colours. In the past, the State
police machinery has excelled in their investigation
skills, even when compared with the investigating
agencies abroad. We fail to see that spark and possibly
that is missing in the investigation relating to the
Comrade Govind Pansare murder case. We are not
presuming that the absconding accused would never
be traced. We are sure that they will be nabbed some
day. However, we must not wait till they surrender or
give up. One has to corner them in such a manner that
there is absolutely no escape route and they are left
with no choice but to surrender to the police. That is
surprisingly not happening despite our orders and
observations therein. We hope and trust that when
persons in power proclaim that they would make
every endeavour to win the confidence and trust of
every single person be it him or her, high or low and
belonging to whichever community, caste and religion,
carry them along and extend to them all opportunities
to develop and shape their personality, then the
investigation and the conduct of the police officials in
this case ought to reflect and depict that effort.
Unfortunately, until now, the investigation has not
achieved that standard. Once the political leaders
leading this country proclaim that they stand for
peace, tolerance and upholding of the constitutional
values, then, the response from the police officials
ought to be in tune with that proclamation. The police
and the Home Ministry officials must realise that their
performance alone will give the confidence, not only
to their political and executive superiors, but to the
general public.
16.        We hope and trust that the efforts to nab the
absconding accused would now take a proper course.
It must chart a course which comes from experience,
expertise and a high degree of skill. If necessary, the
investigating officials and the police team must be
guided by their seniors, maybe even retired police
officials. They are still available and the State must
explore the possibility of taking their advice and
opinion.”
27          Again,     this  Court   (Coram:     S.C.Dharmadhikari      &
G.S.Patel, JJ.), in its order dated 16th September 2019, has, in paras 4
to 7 observed as under :
“4.      We have also perused the report of the SIT set
up to investigate the other case, namely, murder of
Comrade Govind Pansare. The said report sets out
the steps taken in that case. It is stated that the
signatory of this report is associated with the process
mentioned in paragraph 4 of the report of the
Central Bureau of Investigation and he is aware of the
same.
5.      We are anxious to note as to when this report
will contain a statement of independent steps taken
by the SIT during the course of this prolonged
investigation. Uptil now the SIT is resting on the
steps taken by the investigation team set up to
investigate the murders of Gauri Lankesh and
Professor MM Kalburgi in the State of Karnataka and
Dr Narendra Dabholkar in the State of Maharashtra.
This report does not indicate that independent of the
same, the investigations till date revealed anything
other than the details obtained during the course of
investigation in the other cases.
6.      We have expressed even today our displeasure
with this method of investigation. Although we could
have made critical comments with regard to the
contents of the report placed on record by Mr
Tirupati Kakade, the investigating officer who is also
the Additional Superintendent of Police, Kolhapur, it
is only because Mr Mundargi persuades us to give
him one more opportunity that we refrain from
saying anything further. Mr Mundargi prays for such
an opportunity only in the light of recent
developments, particularly the flooding in the region
on account of incessant and continuous rains in this
season.
7.      It is in these circumstances, we post these
matters on 14th October 2019. We expect a more
comprehensive and better report from the SIT which
is set up to investigate the murder of Comrade
28          Again, in its order dated 22nd November 2019, this Court
(Coram: S.C. Dharmadhikari & R.I. Chagla, JJ.), observed in paras 7
“7.      Insofar as the other case is concerned i.e Writ
Petition No. 1565 of 2015 (Smita Pansare & Anr. Vs.
The State of Maharashtra), we have taken on record
the status report of the investigating officer. The
special investigating team set up to investigate this
crime has stated that it is making sincere and genuine
efforts to trace the absconding accused. The details of
the combing operations carried out in the State of
Maharashtra and all over India are set out in this
report. We do not wish to divulge the contents of this
report as well.
8.       We think that the alleged failure of the SIT to
bring all accused to book by itself is not enough to
cast any aspersion presently on the capacity and
capability of the investigating team and its officials.”
29          Again, on 16th January 2020, this Court (Coram: S.C.
Dharmadhikari & R.I. Chagla, JJ.), in paras 4 to 7 observed as under :
“4.        As far as the other case is concerned, namely,
the murder of Comrade Govind Pansare, the status
report of the SIT is tendered and it says that there is
an arrest made by the investigating officers in the State
of Karnataka (SIT, Bengaluru) in the murder of Smt.
Gauri Lankesh. The SIT is keen to investigate, after
this arrest made recently, and trying to ascertain
whether there is any commonality as far as the role of
the recently arrested accused in the murder of
Comrade Govind Pansare. It is said that a team of
police officers is camping at Bengaluru from 13-1-
2020 and in co-ordination with the SIT, Bengaluru, it
is making the necessary inquiry and investigation.
5.       It is stated that by the next date the details of
these measures or steps by the SIT would be placed on
record.
6.       Mr. Mundargi has said that apart from what
has been set out in this report, up till now the SIT has
not been able to make substantial progress insofar as
the arrest of the absconding accused. Yet efforts are on
and in addition to the State of Maharashtra, police
teams have been despatched to the State of Uttar
Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat and Goa in this
regard. From time to time, the details of the
operations launched by them are forwarded to the SIT
which are summarised in this report. Mr. Mundargi
says that within the State of Maharashtra as well, the
search operations are carried out and will continue
with the same intensity and seriousness, as before.
7.       The SIT is hopeful of tracing out the
30         In the order dated 13th February 2020 passed by this Court
(Coram: S.C. Dharmadhikari & R.I. Chagla, JJ.), in paras 3 and 4, it is
“3        In the other crime, Mr. Mundargi, learned
senior counsel submits that there is a report placed
before this Court. That indicates that there are some
developments. The developments would reveal that
the absconding accused are taking shelter in some
parts of India. However, the search team has been
camping in almost every such State where there is a
possibility of the absconding accused, and required in
several crimes, taking shelter and residing by changing
their identities.
including taking assistance from the service providers,
the location of such persons would be ascertained.
Thereafter, intense search would be undertaken.
Presently, some clues are available, but Mr. Mundargi
says that it will not be proper to disclose the clues or
the details in relation thereto.”
31          We may note that there are several orders passed by this
Court in the aforesaid writ petition alongwith other connected
petitions, from time to time, apart from what are reproduced
hereinabove.
32          As there has been no headway or breakthrough in the
investigation till date, the applicants have filed the aforesaid
application, seeking transfer of investigation from SIT to the ATS,
Maharashtra. According to the applicants, despite SIT filing their
reports, stating therein that investigation is in progress, in respect of
the two absconding accused who are named as shooters, no arrests
have been made, till date. The applicants want not only the shooters
to be arrested but even the mastermind behind the said killing of
33          Learned counsel for the applicants submits that the real
breakthrough in the four murder cases i.e. of Dr. Dabholkar,
Comrade Govind Pansare, Dr. M.M. Kalburgi and Gauri Lankesh,
came when ATS, Maharashtra investigated the Nallasopara Bomb
Blast case in 2019. Pursuant to the investigation carried out by ATS in
the said case and the names revealed, in particular of Sharad Kalaskar
and Sachin Andhure, CBI dropped Sarang Akolkar and Vinay Pawar’s
names, as accused, at the time of filing of supplementary charge-sheet
in Dr. Dabholkar’s case on 13 th February 2019. According to the
learned counsel for the applicants, the charge-sheet filed by the ATS,
Maharashtra, in the Nallasopara Bomb Blast case, reveals the gravity
of all the cases and that the accused arrested in the four murder cases
as well as in the Nallasopara Bomb Blast case, were frontline accused
and that they alongwith the mastermind, had hatched a conspiracy to
kill intellectuals. It is submitted that the part of the mastermind and
conspiracy to kill intellectuals, is still to be investigated. He submits
that a perusal of the charge-sheet in the Nallasopara case, would
reveal that a large number of explosives, ammunition and such other
material were confiscated by the ATS, Maharashtra and that there
exists a common sophisticated network of criminals and organisations
behind the said murders. In order to place on record the gravity of
the situation in the four murder cases and as to how some
organizations were vitiating the minds of young people to achieve its
objective, the applicants have reproduced the extract taken from the
Nallasopara charge-sheet in the application at page 40. The same

34             Learned counsel for the applicants submits that even the
weapons used in the four cases were similar. He submits that initially
Sharad Kalaskar and Sachin Andhure were shown as witnesses in
Comrade Pansare’s case, however, subsequently pursuant to the
investigation carried out by the ATS, Maharashtra, they were dropped
as witnesses by the State.         The grievance of the applicants is that
although, common weapons were used and some of the accused are
common, no investigation has been done to find the shooters and the
mastermind. He submits that a combined reading of the five charge-
sheets and a specific reading of the charge-sheet in the Nallasopara
Bomb Blast case, would make it clear that there exists a deeper and
larger conspiracy, however, the mastermind behind all the five cases
have not been traced, till date.
35          As far as Comrade Pansare’s case is concerned, it is not in
dispute that Sachin Andhure and Vinay Pawar, the alleged shooters,
are still absconding. According to the learned counsel for the
applciants, till the breakthrough in the Nallasopara’s case, Sharad
Kalaskar and Sachin Andhure, who are now named as shooters in
Dr. Dabholkar’s case and who are also accused in the other cases,
including the Nallasopara case, were shown as witnesses in Comrade
Pansare’s case. He submits that hence the Pansare family preferred an
application before this Court and brought the same to the notice of
this Court. He submits that thereafter, in the supplementary charge-
sheet dated 6th September 2019, the said witnesses were named as
accused in Comrade Pansare’s case and thereafter, Supplementary
charge-sheet was filed against them and they were arraigned as
accused.    According to the learned counsel for the applicants,
investigations have not made any headway as is reflected even from
the observations made by this Court from time to time and hence, the
applicants pray for transfer of investigation to the ATS, Maharashtra.
36           It appears to us, that it is only when the ATS, Maharashtra
cracked the Nallasopara case, that the accused arrested in the said
case, were identified as shooters in Dr. Dabholkar murder case and
other cases. As investigation by ATS, Maharashtra, had yielded
positive results, the applicants pray that the investigation in Comrade
Pansare’s case be handed over to a specially dedicated team of ATS,
Maharashtra.      The applicants have further stated in the application,
that the trial of the accused in the present case can continue, and, that
the investigation can be transferred without disturbing the present
status of the case.
37           Considering the prayer of the applicants, we asked the
learned Special P.P. Mr. Mundargi to take instructions on the said
application, seeking transfer of investigation from SIT to ATS,
Maharashtra. Pursuant thereto, Mr. Mundargi tendered a letter dated
25th July 2022 addressed to him by Mr. Retesh Kumaarr, Addl. DGP,
CID, Maharashtra State, Pune. In the said letter, the Addl. DGP, CID,
has stated that either a new team of SIT can be constituted or the
investigation can be transferred to ATS, Maharashtra, if the High
Court so desires. We had, on the last occasion, whilst hearing the
application, asked Mr. Mundargi to take instructions whether a few
members of the ATS could join the SIT. Today, Mr. Mundargi informs
us that the officers who have investigated the Nallasopara case, have
already been transferred and as such, the SIT has no objection, if the
said investigation is transferred to ATS, Maharashtra. He, however,
states that some of the officers of SIT can be part of the investigation
conducted by the ATS, Maharashtra, so as to ensure continuity in the
investigation.
38           We have noted several orders passed by this Court. On the
last date, Mr. Mundargi had tendered the latest report in a sealed
envelope. We have opened the seal and perused the said report. The
reports are resealed. The said reports to be kept in the safe custody of
39           No doubt, SIT has taken steps, however, we do not find
any major headway being made in the said investigation. Despite the
efforts of the Officers of SIT, there is no breakthrough. This Court in
the aforesaid petition has been monitoring the investigation since
2016. SIT has been regularly submitting reports with respect to steps
taken to nab the shooters. However, till date, they are absconding.
The wait for the family of Comrade Pansare has been long, for almost
seven years. There is a legitimate expectation not only for the family
of Comrade Pansare, but also the public at large, to see that the
perpetrators of the ghastly crime, are brought to book. And, this is
the responsibility of the investigating machinery, which exists to
preserve law and order. In the present case, SIT and ATS, both are
part of the Maharashtra Police. The transfer of investigation, even
according to Mr. Nevagi, learned counsel for the applicants and Mr.
Mundargi, Special P.P., will not impede the ongoing trial. We are of
the opinion, that transfer is necessiated to ATS to enable them to look
at the investigation from their angle, as enough and more than
sufficient time was given to SIT by this Court. It is necessary that
investigation is taken to its logical end, failing which, the perpetrators
of the crime would be emboldened.
40          Hence, having regard to what is stated aforesaid and also
the statement made by the learned Special P.P, we deem it appropriate
to transfer the investigation to the ATS, Maharashtra.
41          Accordingly,    the Additional Director General of Police,
ATS,    to constitute a team of ATS Officers on similar lines, as
constituted earlier, by SIT.    The said team to include some of the
officers of SIT, who have been investigating the said case and are in
the know-how of the investigation carried out, till date. The
constitution of the team shall be done at the earliest, and in any event,
within one week from the date of uploading of this order.
42          We direct the SIT to hand over all papers of investigation
in the Comdrade Pansare’s case to the Additional Director General,
ATS, within one week from the date of uploading of this order.
43          The Addl. DGP (ATS) to place on record on the next date,
the names of Officers of the ATS team and their designations.
44          Needless to state, that as done earlier, SIT and CBI to
provide    necessary   co-operation  to  ATS,    Maharashtra,     in   its
investigation in the murder of Comrade Govind Pansare.
45          Application is allowed in the aforesaid terms. To be listed
on 20th August 2022, for recording compliance of the constitution of
the team of ATS Officers, including some Officers of SIT.
46          We may note, that the application was heard at length on
the earlier date i.e. on 1st August 2022 and was kept today, only to
enable Mr. Mundargi, Special P.P. to take instructions, as noted by us
earlier.  Today, in the midst, when Mr. Mundargi told us, on the
instructions taken by him, Mr. Jha appearing for the accused tried to
intervene, stating that he be permitted to intervene and address the
Court. The said intervention was vehemently refuted by both, Mr.
Nevagi and Mr. Mundargi. They submitted that the accused had no
locus and that a similar attempt made earlier, was not permitted by
this Court. There is no application on board filed by the accused
seeking intervention in the aforesaid application. Hence, oral request
to intervene is refused.
47         Learned A.P.P assures to forward a copy of this order to
the Additional Director General, ATS, Maharashtra.
48          All concerned to act on the authenticated copy of this
order.
