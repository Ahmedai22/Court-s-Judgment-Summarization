Counsel for Applicant :- Pavan Kumar
1. This is an application seeking transfer of Original Suit
No.925 of 2020, Mohd. Sarfaraz vs. Mohd. Abid and
others, from the Court of Civil Judge (Jr. Division),
Nagina, District - Bijnore to any other Court of competent
jurisdiction in the Judgeship of Bijnore.
2. The applicant has sought transfer on the ground of
allegations against the Presiding Officer in the Court of
Civil Judge (Jr. Division). The learned District Judge was
moved in the first instance, who after perusal of the
material on record did not find any merit and rejected the
applicant's plea seeking transfer, vide order dated
3.8.2022. The applicant has now moved to this Court for
the same relief.
3. The allegation against the Presiding Officer in the Trial
Court is that learned Judge is under the influence of
respondent nos.2 to 4. On 23.9.2021, Shubham Jain, the
Parokar of respondent nos.2 to 4 visited the Trial Judge
and the learned counsel representing respondent nos.2 to
4 also visited the Judge for 15 minutes in his chamber. At
that time, the Parokar of respondent nos.2 to 4, to wit,
Shubham Jain was standing outside the Chamber of the
learned Judge. It is further stated in paragraph 15 that no
written statement has been filed by the defendants till
date. There is no possibility of the trial of suit being
concluded in the near future.
4. Heard Mr. Pavan Kumar, learned counsel for the
applicant at length in support of this application.
5. The allegations that have been levelled against the
Presiding Officer in the Trial Court are reflective of the
current trend in the society where the general public have
developed the mind set to overawe Judges by
complaining and maligning them on baseless allegations.
The allegations disclosed on affidavit in the present
transfer application are so frivolous that they are only
stated to be rejected. Such tendencies are required to be
put down with a heavy hand.
6. In the circumstances, this application is dismissed with
the costs of Rs.10,000/- which the applicant shall deposit
in the account of District Services Legal Authority, Bijnore
within 15 days hence. In case, the cost is not deposited,
the District Magistrate, Bijnore shall recover the costs as
arrears of land revenue and cause them to be deposited
in the account of the Secretary, District Legal Services
Authority, Bijnore forthwith.
7. Let this order be communicated to the Civil Judge
(Junior Division) Nagina, District - Bijnore through the
learned District Judge, Bijnore, the learned District Judge,
Bijnore, the Secretary, District Legal Services Authority,
Bijnore and the District Magistrate, Bijnore by the
Registrar (Compliance) by 31.8.2022.
