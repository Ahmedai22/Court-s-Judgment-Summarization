4.   The learned counsel for the petitioner submits the
petitioner is the owner of the VIVO mobile phone and
investigation is already completed, therefore Investigating
Officer has directed to release the mobile phone in his favour
and there is no need for any investigation and mobile phone is
not required. Hence prayed for allowing the petition.
5.   Per contra learned HCGP objected the petition and
contended that as per the report of the Investigating Officer
obtained by him, there are so many notices issued to this
petitioner for opening the lock of the mobile phone, in order to
collect the data of the video clippings, but the petitioner is not
co-operating with the Investigating Officer. The Investigating
Officer made complaint against this petitioner before the trial
court, however, inspite of the trial court advising him to open
the lock of the mobile phone, the petitioner has not yet opened.
Therefore the mobile phone shall not be released in his favour,
hence prayed for dismissing the petition.
6.    Having heard the arguments and perused the
records, ofcourse on perusal of the records, which reveals the
petitioner said to have covered the video graph through his
mobile    phone   during  the  proceedings    of  Mysore    Urban
CRL.P No. 10518 of 2022
Development Authority (MUDA).        Also, the petitioner said to
have prevented discharging of official duty of the MUDA
commissioner, hence complainant came to be filed against this
petitioner. This petitioner said to be RTI activist, who is said to
have covered the proceedings of the meeting. After registering
the FIR the petitioner said to be arrested and released on bail.
The police seized the mobile phone for having taken the video
clippings.   Now the investigating is completed, charge sheet
has been filed.    The Investigation Officer categorically stated
the petitioner is not cooperating with the Investigation Officer
for opening the lock of the mobile phone in order to download
the data and also send it for the FSL.         The report of the
Investigation officer reveals there were so many notices issued
to the petitioner, but inspite of the same, the petitioner is not
opening the lock of mobile phone by using the password.
Though the charge sheet is filed, but the police officer is not
able to retrieve the data from the mobile phone due to locking
of the mobile phone by this petitioner.         The petitioner is
keeping the password secret and is not co-operating with the
Investigating Officer. The notices were issued to the petitioner
on 12.4.2022, 19.4.2022 and 9.5.2022 and inspite of the
issuing notices at different intervals, the petitioner is not
CRL.P No. 10518 of 2022
cooperating and has not unlocked the mobile phone by using
the password which shows that the petitioner is not cooperating
with Investigation Officer.     Therefore, until the petitioner is
opening the lock of the mobile phone and helping the
Investigating Officer to verify the video clippings and other
messages, this petitioner is not entitled for the release of the
mobile phone. The petitioner not co-operated, the Investigating
Officer then they seek cancellation of bail. If the petitioner do
not co-operate with the Investigation Officer, then they can
seek cancellation of his bail.
Accordingly, this petition is dismissed.
However, the petitioner is having liberty to approach the
Court for release of the mobile phone by opening the video
after unlocking the mobile phone by using the password.
