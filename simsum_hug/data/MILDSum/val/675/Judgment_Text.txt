1.     This second appeal is directed against the judgment and decree
dated 09.09.2010 passed by the learned Senior Civil Judge, Nirmal,
in A.S.No.15 of 2006 confirming the judgment and decree dated
14.08.2006 passed by the learned Junior Civil Judge, Nirmal, in
O.S.No.108 of 1997. The said suit was filed by the plaintiff seeking
for declaration and recovery of possession of suit schedule property.
By the judgment dated 14.08.2006, the trial Court decreed the suit
with costs in favour of the plaintiff.
2.     Vemula Sulochana-plaintiff filed a suit for declaration of
possession of the land admeasuring Ac.2.25 guntas, dry, situated in
Sy.No.392 of Rajura Village of Khanapur Mandal (hereinafter referred
to as ‘suit land’), inter alia contending that she is the owner and
possessor of the suit land and that she succeeded the same from her
deceased mother-Lalitha Bai and her mother died in the year 1996
leaving behind her daughter, the plaintiff, as the sole legal heir.
Thereafter, the plaintiff approached the Mandal Revenue Officer,
Khanapur, to mutate the suit land in her favour after the death of her
mother as successor. The defendant is the brother of her father i.e.
junior paternal uncle and he was looking after the properties of her
mother and cultivating the suit land on batai basis and he was giving
share in the crop to her mother every year. Even after the demise of
her mother, the defendant used to give paddy crop to her. When the
plaintiff approached the Village Administrative Officer of Rajura
Village for payment of land revenue and also for issuance of pattadar
pass book and title deed, he refused to issue the same, and as such,
she approached the Mandal Revenue Officer and applied certified
copies of pahanies in respect of the suit land and also to know the
procedure to mutate the suit land in her name. At that point of time
she noticed that the name of the defendant is reflecting in the
pattedar column and cultivation column. The plaintiff would also
submit that the defendant got mutated his name in revenue records
with the collusion of the Village Administrative Officer by name
Venkat Rao who is his close relative. Thereafter, the plaintiff filed a
petition on 02.09.1997 before the Mandal Revenue Officer to cancel
the mutation in the name of the defendant and to affect the same in
her name. As the Mandal Revenue Officer refused to cancel the name
of the defendant, the plaintiff filed the present suit seeking
declaration and recovery of possession as well as rectification of the
revenue entries.
3.     The defendant in his written statement while denying the
averments made by the plaintiff, submitted that the father of the
plaintiff was his elder brother and that their joint family consists of
three brothers and the suit land was the joint family property. As the
plaintiff’s father late Basa Hanumantha Rao was the elder and kartha
of joint family was looking after the entire agricultural operations, the
lands were kept in his name and after his death, the properties were
mutated in the name of his wife. The defendant would submit that as
there are disputes arose between the parties regarding the suit land,
with the intervention of the relatives and caste elders a panchayat
was held in the Ellapi Sangham on 24.01.1993. In the said
panchayat it was agreed by both the parties that the suit land has to
be mutated in the name of the defendant and the husband of the
plaintiff-Venkat Ramulu agreed and signed for the proposed mutation
and in view of the re-arrangement between the parties as agreed, the
suit land was mutated in the name of the defendant. He would
further assert that the plaintiff is estopped by the agreement dated
24.01.1993, and thus, the suit is not maintainable since the plaintiff
has no locus to file the suit.
4.     The plaintiff, in support of her case, examined herself as P.W.1
and also P.Ws.2 to 4 including the Mandal Revenue Officer and relied
upon Exs.A.1 to A.17. The defendant examined himself as D.W.1 and
also examined D.Ws.2 and 3 on his behalf and relied upon Exs.B.1 to
5.     The trial Court, after appreciating the evidence on record,
decreed the suit with costs in favour of the plaintiff and directed the
defendant to deliver possession of the suit land and the plaintiff is
entitled to rectification of revenue entries in the records. Aggrieved by
the said judgment, the defendant preferred appeal in A.S.No.15 of
2006. The appellate Court dismissed the appeal confirming the
judgment of the trial Court, and thus, the defendant preferred this
6.     Heard the learned counsel appearing for the appellant as well
as the learned counsel appearing for the respondent. Perused the
entire record and the case law cited by both the counsel.
7.     Learned counsel for the appellant would argue that the suit
property is a joint family property, but both the Courts below erred in
decreeing the suit. He would further assert that Ex.B.1 pahani for the
year 1975-76 was misconstrued which shows that the father of
respondent-plaintiff is pattadar of suit land and in column No.15 it is
shown as ‘swantham’. The respondent herein did not file any
document to show that the suit property is a self acquired property of
her father. Learned counsel raised the following substantial questions
a)      Whether both the Courts had justified in decreeing the suit of
the respondent-plaintiff on the basis of the evidence let in by
b)      Whether the findings of both the Courts are perverse or not?
c)      Whether in the absence of any link document earliest to
Ex.B.1 to show that the father of the plaintiff is the exclusive
owner of the suit schedule property, the Court below was right
d)      Whether in a suit for declaration and recovery of possession
the initial burden of the proving prima facie title to the
property lies on the plaintiff and that plaintiff must stand or
fail on its strength. Whether in the absence of discharge of
such initial burden the Courts below were right in shifting the
8.       Learned counsel for the appellant would rely upon the case law
to support his contentions. In a decision reported in SAJANA
GRANITES, MADRAS V/s. MANDUVA SRINIVASA RAO1 it was held
that in a suit for declaration of title and possession the plaintiff could
succeed only on the strength of his title but not on the failure on the
part of the defendant to prove his title. Another decision cited by the
learned counsel for the appellant reported in SURAJ BHAN V/s.
FINANCIAL COMMISSIONER2 for the proposition that an entry in
revenue records does not confer title on a person whose name appears
in record-of-rights. Entries in the revenue records or jamabandi have
only ‘fiscal purpose’ i.e. payment of land revenue, and no ownership is
conferred on the basis of such entries. So far as title to the property is
concerned, it can only be decided by a competent civil court.
9.      Before the appellate Court, the appellant argued that the trial
Court erred in decreeing the suit basing on the weaknesses of the
defendant but not on the strength of the plaintiff, but the appellate
Court after considering the evidence on record and the case law cited
before it held that the said decision has no application to the facts of
the case on hand since the plaintiff established her title by way of
abundant documentary material and the inconsistent stand taken by
the defendant and also leading evidence contrary to the pleadings.
Even the appellate Court relied upon a case law reported in
PANCHAPPANAVAR3 and held that it is well settled position of law
that mutation of a property in the revenue records does not create or
extinguish title nor its presumptive value on title. It was also
observed that the defendant in the cross-examination clearly
admitted that partition took place between the defendant and his two
brothers long ago. After the death of their father their names were
mutated for properties that fell to their shares and in that manner
the suit land was recorded in the name of the father of the plaintiff
and after his death in the name of his widow Lalitha Bai. The trial
Court also held that the defendant filed Ex.B1 pahani for the year
1975-76 which shows that the plaintiff’s father is the pattedar of suit
land and in Column No.15 it was shown as ‘swantham’ i.e. self
acquired property and in Ex.B2 the name of the mother of the
plaintiff was entered in the pahani for the year 1985-86 and in
Column No.12 it was shown as 50(B) Patta and in the cultivation
column also her name was reflected. Even in the pahanies for the
years 1994-95 and 1995-96 the name of the plaintiff’s mother was
shown as pattedar of the suit land. Exs.B3 and A1 pertains to the
year 1993-94 in which the name of the plaintiff’s mother was shown
as pattedar. The name of defendant first time was shown as pattedar
in pahani of 1996-97 under Ex.B6. The defendant argued that his
name was shown in possessory column and in Column No.15 it is
mentioned as ‘hisitardaru’ and thus he was a co-sharer of the suit
land. But the trial Court observed that by the date of death of the
father of the plaintiff defendant was aged 20 to 25 years and hence at
the time of partition he was major and aged 20 to 25 years but he did
not made any effort to enter his name in the revenue records and
only after the death of the plaintiff’s mother he got his name mutated
in the revenue records and that he failed to prove that he is a
co-sharer of the suit land. The plaintiff also contended that defendant
was looking after the properties on batai basis even during the life
time of her mother, as she died in the year 1995, he got his name
mutated in the year 1997, and thus, he was never in the possession
of the suit land. It was also observed by both the Courts that the
defendant was taking inconsistent pleas. The trial Court in Issue
No.3 clearly held that the defendant entered his name wrongfully in
collusion with revenue authorities and thereafter the Mandal
Revenue Officer without following proper procedure effected mutation
in Ex.A5 and the defendant failed to file any documents to prove his
right over the land. Even the appellate Court held that the revenue
authorities did not follow due procedure while effecting mutation in
the name of the defendant.
10.    Learned counsel for the appellant would further argue that the
suit land is a joint family property and not self acquired property of
plaintiff and that the plaintiff did not file any iota of evidence to
support of her contention. The said issue was dealt with by the trial
Court in detail and after considering the entire evidence on record
rightly declared the plaintiff as owner of the suit land, which was also
confirmed by the appellate Court. It is to be noted that when there
are concurrent findings of both the Courts in a well reasoned order,
the Second Appeal is not maintainable without any substantial
question of law involved in it.
11.    This Court therefore finds no merit in the second appeal. No
question of law, much less a substantial question of law, arises for
consideration in this appeal. The Second Appeal is accordingly
dismissed with costs.
12.    Pending miscellaneous petitions, if any, shall also stand
dismissed in the light of this final judgment.
