This petition has been filed seeking to quash the F.I.R. filed against
the petitioner for the offence punishable under Sections 457 and 380 of IPC
in Crime No.3121 of 2021, on the file of the first respondent police.
2. The crux of the allegation in the FIR is that the second respondent
/ first informant is an Advocate and an office bearer of Thiruvotriyur Bar
Association. According to him, he is in possession of around 2852 sq.ft. of
land belonging to Kaligambal Temple and he has kept his household utensils
there. It is further stated that on 14.07.2021, he came to know that some
persons entered his premises and removed his articles and also torn the
banners, immediately, he gave a complaint to the police and as no action has
been taken, he filed a petition under Section 156(3) of Cr.P.C. before the
learned Judicial Magistrate, Thiruvotriyur and pursuant to the direction
given in the said petition, a FIR has been registered against the petitioner for
offence punishable under Sections 457 and 380 of IPC.
3. The learned counsel appearing for the petitioner seeks to quash the
said FIR and would submit that filing of the FIR is calculated and motivated
only in order to grab the property, which is under the control and possession
of the petitioner’s mother. It is his contention that the petitioner's mother has
purchased the superstructure measuring an extent of 2852 sq.fts from one
S.Baby W/o Subramaniyam, by way of a registered Sale deed dated
28.04.1980, registered as Document No.872/1980, in the office of the Sub
Registrar, Thiruvotriyur. He further submitted that water tax and property
tax stands in the name of the petitioner’s mother and she is regularly paying
the taxes to the authorities. Electricity service connection also stood in the
name of the petitioner's mother. The petitioner's mother has let out the
premises in the year 2008 to one Mr.Karthick for doing business and he has
vacated the premises on 12.07.2021. Due to lock-down, the said tenant
defaulted in payment of electricity charges for two years and due to which
the electricity service connection was was disconnected.
4. The learned counsel further submitted that on 14.07.2021, at about
6.00 p.m. he came know through neighbours that persons wearing black and
white dress entered into the petitioner’s premises and tried to lock open the
premises in order to take possession. When the petitioner rushed to the spot,
he was threatened by the Advocates. The petitioner lodged a complaint and
the police enquired the petitioner and the second respondent. The petitioner
was requested not to press the complaint against the second respondent who
is an Advocate and the said complaint was closed.
5. The learned counsel for the petitioner further submitted that, when
the petitioner made an application for restoration of the electricity service
connection on 05.08.2021, he received a SMS from the Electricity
Department that his application is put on hold for verification with the EB
officials, as already another person by name Mrs.Lakshmi, the wife of the
second respondent herein, has applied for electricity service connection for
the very same premises belonging to the petitioner’s mother and therefore
the EB officials have withheld both the applications. Thereafter only the
petitioner came to know that the second respondent has created some
residential certificate and produced the same before the EB officials in order
to grab the property.
6. The learned counsel for the petitioner further submitted that
thereafter, the second respondent filed an application under Section 156(3)
of Cr.P.C. and without following the guidelines of the Hon’ble Apex Court
in Priyanka Srivastava and another Vs. State of Uttar Pradesh and others
reported in (2015) 6 SCC 287 the learned Judicial Magistrate passed a
mechanical order and based on that a FIR has been registered against the
petitioner. Hence, he would contend that the entire FIR is an abuse of
process of law and it is only to grab the land of the petitioner. He has also
brought to the notice of the Court that the sale deed is in favour of the
petitioner’s mother, property tax receipts and electricity receipts in the name
of the petitioner's mother. It is his contention that the complaint given by the
second respondent is calculated and motivated only to grab the land of the
petitioner.
7. The learned counsel further submitted that the application filed
under Section 156(3) of Cr.P.C. was also allowed mechanically by the
learned Judicial Magistrate, Thiruvottiyur, where the second respondent was
as member of the Bar and also an Office Bearer of the Bar Association,
Thiruvottiyur. Hence, the learned counsel appearing for the petitioner
contended that all these aspects clearly shows that it is a classic case of
abuse of process of law by setting the criminal law in motion to grab the land
of someone by a powerful section of the Society.
8. Initially notice was sent to the second respondent, which was
returned as "addressee left", thereafter, notice was directed to be served at
Thiruvottiyur Bar Association and thereafter only the second respondent
appeared through his counsel Mr.S.Ravichandran.
9. It is the contention of the learned counsel appearing for the second
respondent/defacto complainant herein that the defacto complainant is in
possession of the land belonging to the Temple and he has taken the property
on lease from the Temple. Therefore, only the Temple authorities are
competent to say who is in possession of the above property. He further
submitted that the FIR has been registered properly and denied all the
allegations of abuse of process of law. It is his contention that he is in legal
possession by way of lease and therefore seeks to dismiss this quash petition.
10. The learned Additional Public Prosecutor appearing for the first
respondent police would submit that police registered the FIR since there
was a direction under Section 156(3) of Cr.P.C. by the learned Judicial
Magistrate, Thiruvottiyur and submitted that he is leaving the matter to the
11. Heard the learned counsel on either side and also perused the
materials available on record.
12. Normally while exercising power under Section 482 of Cr.P.C., if
there is a prima facie allegation and it discloses a cognizable offence, the
Courts will not interfere with the F.I.R. but at the same time, the materials
produced before this Court prima facie indicate that the F.I.R. is nothing but
motivated and filed for some other purpose or maliciously instituted with an
ulterior motive, the Court can very well interfere with such F.I.R. The
impugned F.I.R. has been filed on the basic of the order passed by the
learned Judicial Magistrate, Thiruvottiyur and the order of the learned
Judicial Magistrate dated 15.09.2021, passed in C.M.P.No.2722 of 2021 is
"Heard,  Perused,     Order    pronounced,
Offences contained in the petition is cognizable.
Hence this Court hereby directed to Station House
Officer 118 Thiruvottiyur Police Station to
register a FIR on the petition filed by petitioner
before the respond police on 14.07.2021 on or
before one month from this order date."
13. Normally, when a petition is filed under Section 156(3) of Cr.P.C.
the learned Judicial Magistrate will seek a report and direct the investigating
officer to investigate and file a report. Be that as it may, the affidavit filed
before the learned Judicial Magistrate is bereft of details. According to the
second respondent, the land in question was under his control and he was
peacefully maintaining it from the year 2016 as per the oral orders passed by
the Temple authorities. However, there is no whisper whatsoever in his
affidavit about the so called lease as projected before this Court.
14. The sale deed dated 28.04.1980, filed in the typed set of papers by
the petitioner, indicates that the superstructure has been sold with leasehold
right in favour of the petitioner's mother. It is a registered sale deed, the
property tax receipts filed in the typed set of papers is also in the name of the
petitioner's mother Mrs.L.Gandhimathi, even in the year 2018.                    The
encumbrance certificate also reflects the entry of the sale deed in the name of
the petitioner's mother. The electricity service charges has also been paid by
the petitioner's mother.      From the records, it can be seen that in the year
2008, the premises was let out to one Mr.Karthick for doing business and he
constructed a shed and was doing steel business and thereafter the said
Karthick has also vacated the premises and handed over possession to the
petitioner's mother. In the additional typed set of papers filed before this
Court by the petitioner, it is clearly shown that before the name-board of
Karthick Steel some posters have been affixed. The second respondent /
defacto complainant is stated to have obtained a residential certificate in the
name of his wife to show that he is in possession from 23.07.2016. It is only
a computer generated certificate and no other evidence has been placed by
the second respondent to show that he was in possession from 2016. If
really the second respondent is in possession of the property, there is no need
to keep household vessels in the premises. This also clearly create some
doubt his claim. It also probabilise the petitioner's case that the same has
been created only for the purpose of taking forceful possession and judicial
process has been misused. As could be seen from the typed set of papers,
several complaints have also been given against the second respondent in the
Anti Land Grabbing Cell, Thiruvottiyur by the petitioner, but no action has
been taken by the police authorities.
15. It is relevant to refer the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court
in Priyanka Srivastava and another Vs. State of Uttar Pradesh and others
reported in (2015) 6 SCC 287, the Hon'ble Supreme Court has held that the
remedy available under Section 156(3) Cr.P.C. is not of routine nature.
Exercise of power thereunder requires application of judicial mind. The
learned Magistrate exercising said power must remain vigilant with regard to
nature of allegations made in the application and not to issue directions
without proper application of mind.            In an appropriate case, learned
Magistrate can verify the truth and veracity of allegations made, having
regard to nature thereof and the power under Section 156(3) of Cr.P.C.
cannot be invoked by a litigant at his own whim to harass others. It can be
invoked only by a principled and really aggrieved citizen approaching the
Court with clean hands. Prior application under Section 154(1) of Cr.P.C.
and Section 154(3) of Cr.P.C. have to be in existence while filing a petition
under Section 156(3) of Cr.P.C. and these aspects should be clearly spelt out
in the application under Section 156(3) of Cr.P.C. and necessary documents
to that effect has to be filed.
16. The complaint filed by the first respondent under Section 156(3) of
Cr.P.C. does not even whisper about the steps taken under Section 154(3) of
the Cr.P.C.       The learned Magistrate has simply allowed the application
without making any enquiry and even the veracity of the allegations are not
verified with the documents. The documents filed on the side of the
petitioner clearly shows that he is in possession of the property and only
during COVID period the tenant has vacated the premises, which has been
taken advantage of by the second respondent by filing a complaint under
Section 156(3) of Cr.P.C. and mechanically an order has also been passed by
the learned Judicial Magistrate, Thiruvottiyur. The petitioner has also sent a
complaint to the Superintendent of Police, Anti Land Grabbing Cell. He also
sought details as to on what basis the residential certificate has been issued,
however no reply has been given by the authorities.
17. All the above facts clearly probabilise the contention of the
petitioner that F.I.R. is nothing but an abuse of process of law. Further, the
account summary in respect of the electricity service meter also shows that it
is in the name of the petitioner's mother all along. Such view of the matter,
the learned Judicial Magistrate, Thiruvottiyur without applying his mind has
mechanically passed the order without even verifying the veracity of the
complaint. The second respondent as a member of the very same Bar and
also an Official Bearer of the Bar Association, Thiruvottiyur, obtained the
order.        The learned Judicial Magistrate, Thiruvottiyur has mechanically
passed the said order which suffers from non-application of mind. Further,
the said order directing the first respondent police to register F.I.R. against
the petitioner is contrary to the law laid down by the Hon'ble Supreme Court
in Priyanka Srivastava case (cited supra).
18. In the case of State of Haryana and Others vs. Bhajan Lal and
Others reported in 1992 SUPP (1) Supreme Court Cases – 335, the Hon'ble
Supreme Court has set out the following guidelines for quashing the
information report or the complaint, even if they
are taken at their face value and accepted in their
entirety do not prima facie constitute any offence
or make out a case against the accused.

Considering the above judgments, the Court finds that the FIR is motivated
and a mala fide one.
19. Such view of the matter, this Court holds that the complaint in
Crime No.3121 of 2021 on the file of the first respondent police, is nothing
but an abuse of process of law and the same is liable to be quashed and
accordingly quashed.         The Criminal Original Petition is allowed.
Consequently, the connected miscellaneous petition is closed.
