We are called upon to resolve a conundrum under Private
International Law/Conflict of Laws, involving French Law, as to, “Whether
or not a wife, who has suffered a decree of divorce in the Court of Superior
Instance at France with further orders of liquidation of property, can
maintain a suit for partition and separate possession of her half share in the
community properties before the Family Court at Puducherry, without
applying to the Notaires with the respective Chamber of Notaires at France,
within a period of three months, in view of Article 1444 of French Civil
2. In this case, the Appellant/Defendant, was the Husband and the
Respondent/Plaintiff was the wife, since divorced.          For the sake of
convenience, they are referred as Husband and Wife, in this judgment. Both
parties to the suit, are admittedly French Nationals and their claims and
contentions relate to the rights and liabilities arising out of the divorce
granted and hence the foreign element.
3. Under the French law, the marital relationship of a husband and
wife is under two different regimes. They can have a contract regime, which
would mean that terms of their prenuptial contract would govern their inter-
se relationship, whereby they can mutually agree as to whether their
properties would remain separate property or common property, their
financial relationship etc. In the absence of a contract, they would be under
community regime (communauté legalé).                      Articles 1401 to 1495 of the
French Civil Code deal with the community regime. The english translation
of the relevant Articles 1401 and 1402 reads as follows :
comprise acquisitions made by the spouses
together or separately during the marriage, and
coming both from their personal activity and
from savings made on the fruits and incomes of
their personal property.
immovable, shall be deemed an acquisition of
the community where it is not proved that it is a
separate property of one of the spouses in
accordance with a provision of law.
Where a property is one of those which do not
display proof or mark of their origin, personal
ownership of a spouse, if disputed, shall be
established in writing. Failing an inventory or
other contemporaneously constituted proof, the
judge may take into consideration all writings, in
particular family instruments of title, registers
and papers, as well as bank documents and
invoices. He may even admit testimonial or
presumptive evidence, where he observes that it
was materially or morally impossible for one

Thus, the husband and wife, subject to            other limitations and
liabilities, are entitled to equal share of the community estate.
2° “By declared absence” (Act no 77-1447 of 28 Dec. 1977);
Thus, upon divorce, the community is dissolved and subject to other
rights and liabilities, the husband and wife are entitled to 50% each of the
community estate.
5. To understand the process of separation, it is useful to read,
'Art. 1443- Where through the disorder of the
affairs, misadministration or misconduct of one
spouse, it appears that the upholding of the
community imperils the interest of the other
spouse, the latter may sue in court for separation
of property. Any voluntary separation is void.
Art. 1444 - Separation of property, although
ordered in court, is void where the proceedings
tending to liquidate the rights of the parties have
not be initiated within three months after the
judgment has become res judicata or where the
final settlement has not occurred within the year
of the opening of the process of liquidation. The
president of the court in the form of interim
Thefore, the community property even if ordered to be separated, shall
become void, unless the liquidation proceedings are intitated within three
months from the judgment and the final settlement should be completed
within one year of the Judgment.
6. The Notaires (Notaries) of France are covered by ordinance of
November 2, 1945 and Article 1 of the same provides that "Notaries are
public officers, established to receive all acts and contracts to which the
parties must or wish to make these authentic, attached to the acts of public
authority, and ensure the date, retain the deposit, deliver a Grosse and
Expedition 4”. Their role in this lis is to liquidate the assets as per the
agreement, if any, between the parties and if parties failed to arrive at any
consensus, they can pass an order enforcing liquidation in a particular

manner5. The above text of the law, legal position and the role of the
notaries under French Law are agreed by both sides.
7. The appellant and the respondent are French nationals. Their
marriage was solemnised on 22.01.1982 at Sarcelles, France.                                           They
established their marital abode at De Creteil, France. From the lawful
wedlock, two children Julie Jayanthi Marie and Sriram Jean-Marie
Govindh were born to them at France on 09.03.1984 and 21.12.1990.
8. The properties morefully described under Schedule-A, being three
immovable properties situate at Puducherry, were purchased during the
subsistence of their marriage, on 01.08.1988, 01.10.1992 and on
24.06.1999 under sale deeds, registered as Document Nos.2433/1988,
1589/1992 and 2746/1999 respectively, at Puducherry. On 08.03.2005, the
marriage between the parties was dissolved by a decree of divorce by the
Court of Superior Instance at Cretiel and the english translation of relevant

9. Thereafter, on 13.08.2012, the respondent/wife filed the present
O.S.No.4 of 2013 on the file of the learned Family Judge, Puducherry,
praying for partition of these three immovable properties mentioned in the
schedule-A and movables mentioned in the schedule-B into two halves and
allot one half share in the said properties to the plaintiff and by appointing
an Advocate Commissioner to measure schedule-A property by metes and
bounds and to take inventory of the schedule-B property and put the plaintiff
in the separate possession of her share.
10. The husband, duly contesting the suit, filed a written statement
claiming that the present suit is not maintainable as the wife had failed and
neglected to resort to the liquidation proceedings within three months from
the date of divorce coming into force before the Notaries in France and
therefore, the present suit which is filed eight years after the divorce before
the Indian Court is not maintainable.
11. With the above pleadings, the Family Court at Puducherry framed
“(i) Whether the plaintiff is entitled to file the
suit for partition against the defendant claiming
(ii) Whether it is true that the suit properties
(iii) Whether it is true that the first item of “A“
schedule property was built with the hard earned
(iv) Whether the plaintiff is entitled to claim half
(v) To what relief, the plaintiff is entitled?“
12. The plaintiff examined herself as P.W.1 and examined one Vidya
as P.W.2 and on behalf of the plaintiff, Exs.A1 to A16 were marked. The
defendant examined himself as D.W.1 and on behalf of the defendant,
Exs.B1 to B6 were marked.
13.    After considering evidence on record and contention of the
parties, the Family Court ruled that, (i) the matter pertains to family and
even though it is among the divorced couples, the Family Court had
jurisdiction; (ii) As per the community regime under the French Code Civil,
which is the law applicable to the parties, the properties, being purchased
during the subsistence of the marriage, form part of the community and
therefore, the husband and wife were entitled to 50% share of the
community property; (iii) Upon being granted divorce, as per Article 1441,
the community got dissolved and therefore, the wife is entitled to seek for
partition and separate possession of her share of the property; (iv) that the
Article 1444 does not apply to the instant case because, the respondent's
husband, even though is taking the defence, he has also not filed any
liquidation petition before the Notaire and since both the parties failed to
move the Notaire, the present suit is maintainable and passed a preliminary
decree by its judgment and decree dated 30.01.2017 granting ½ share to the
respondent/wife, as against which the present appeal is laid before this
F. The submissions made in the Appeal Suit:
14. Mr.J. Kumaran, learned Counsel for the appellant submitted that
in this case, almost all the facts are admitted. There is no quarrel over the
fact that the properites originally formed as community as they were
purchased during subsistence of their marriage. There is no quarrel for
proposition that the wife is entitled to 50% of the community property and
that the community got dissolved upon the pronounciation of the divorce
decree. But, however, as per the learned Counsel, on perusal of the French
Court's judgment, dated 08.05.2005 granting divorce, it would be clear that
it not only ordered divorce, but also ordered that the assets to be liquidated
and directed the President of the Chamber of Notary or his delegate to take
up the matter of liquidation of the matrimonial system either by recording
the agreement of the parties or in default to commit the parties to the choice
of the notary and to supervise and monitor the course and represent the case
of difficulties.
15. According to the learned Counsel for the appellant, this amounts
to ordering of separation of property and therefore, as per Article 1444,
within a period of three months from the date of judgment, the spouses had
to file proceedings before the Notary and the respondent/wife, having failed
to approach the Notary, is not entitled to file the present suit, since, Article
1444 renders the separation of the property as void. In substance, his
cotention is that for all purposes, the French Civil Code should be applied
and therefore, the Trial Court ought to have dismissed the suit as not
maintainable.
16. Per contra, Mr.T.Ramachandran, learned Counsel appearing for
the respondent/wife would submit that the Family Court, has correctly
appreciated the position under the French Civil Code. D.W.1, the husband
had categorically admitted that the properties are part of the community and
that the wife will be entitled to 50% of the same and therefore, submitted
that Article 1444 is not applicable to the facts of the case and wife is entitled
to sue separately for partition of her share, since the properties are located in
Puducherry.       Thus , the question as framed by us above in the paragraph
No.1 of this judgment arises.
17. The parties are French Nationals and hence the rules of Private
International Law/Conflict of laws come into operation.                             As the Indian
Courts have broadly followed the English Rules of Private International
Law, with modifications and departure wherever necesssary, the Hon'ble
Supreme Court of India, in Technip SA -Vs- SMS Holding (P) Ltd6 has
quoted the principles with approval, as contained in Cheshire & North's
Private International Law7. According to G.C. Cheshire, the object of these
rules are three fold and they are (i) Jurisdiction of the Court; (ii) to make the
choice of law (lex causae) (iii) recognition and enforcement of foreign
decrees.
7 Chesire & North's Priviate International Law, by Peter North & JJ Fawcet – Butterworths , 12th Edn.
18. In this case, there is no difficulty with regard to the Jurisdiction of
Indian Courts(sic Family Court, Puducherry) as admittedly both parties
were ordinarily residing at Puducherry and the Schedule properties are
situate within the territorial jurisdiction of Puducherry. The only dispute
which was raised was that whether the wife should have moved the Civil
Court instead of the Family Court as the prayer was for partition of the
schedule properties. As per Section 7(1) of the Family Courts Act, 1984, a
Family Court shall- (a) have and exercise all the jurisdiction exercisable by
any district court or any subordinate civil court under any law for the time
being in force in respect of suits and proceedings of the nature referred to in
the Explanation. As per Explanation (c) a suit or proceeding between the
parties to a marriage with respect to the property of the parties or of either of
them would fall within the Jurisdiction of the Family Court and the Trial
Court has also rightly answered the same.
19. The next step is to classify /characterize the cause of action and
select the law applicable(lex causae). As far the claim ½ share in the
Schedule properties by the Wife is concerned the same is claimed arising out
of the the rights and obligations flowing from the Marriage and Divorce,
and therefore, is in the realm of Personal Law. The personal law applicable
to them is the French Code Civil, being the lex patriae, that is, the law of the
nationality of the persons.   They would carry their personal law wherever
they are domiciled. The establishment of 'community' and dissolution thereof
are part of their marital rights and obligations and as such are to be
characterized as their personal law rights. A reading of the decree of divorce
granted by the French Court and the pleadings of the parties in the instant
suit, would be clear that the parties did not have a contract regime and as
such they were in the community regime. The suit schedule properties were
purchased during the marriage was in subsistence and therefore form part of
the community property.       The marriage between the plaintiff and the
defendant was dissolved by the competent French Court by a decree of
divorce, dated 08.03.2005 and therefore, by virtue of Article 1441, upon
dissolution of the marriage, the community got dissolved and the parties are
entitled to separation of properties, in accordance with the rules contained in
Articles 1401 to 1492 of the French Civil Code. Therefore, the plaintiff
herein is entitled for partition and separate possession in the schedule
mentioned properties. There is no any contention or dispute, which is raised
before us on these aspects. Hence, we hold that French Code Civil, shall be
the lex causae in determining the rights of the parties and under the same,
the Wife is entitled to ½ share in the Suit Schedule properties as prayed by
20. However, the contention is in respect of second question, as to
how to effect the said separation. The contention of the Husband is that even
inrespect of the same, the lex causae should only be the French Civil Code
and as per Article 1444, the wife ought to have approached the Notary for
liquidation within a period of three months and she, having failed to do so,
the present suit is not maintainable.
21. Moreover, when it comes to the manner of effecting partition, we
hold that the Indian Law would be lex causae and not the French Code
Civil, more specifically Article 1444 would not apply for the following
(a) The manner of effecting partition is a rule of procedure and therefore in
matters of rules of procedure, the law of the forum, namely, lex fori, will be
applicable. As per Indian Law, only a suit for partition has to be filed and
finally an Advocate Commissioner appointed by the Court in the final decree
would effect the partition of the property. There is no Notaire system under
lex fori. Unlike Indian Law, where there are separate enactments dealing
with Substantive Law and Procedural Law, French Code Civil is a
compendium of their entire Civil Law, including substantive law, procedural
law, the rules of evidence, limitation etc.    Article 1444 is a procedural
provision and therefore would not apply.
(b)      Looking at this second limb of effecting partition of the dissolved
community property by considering the Schedule-A properties, it also
touches upon effecting physical division of the immovable properties by
metes and bounds and therefore, lex situs, that is ,the law of land where the
property is situate, would apply. A Coordinate Division Bench of this Court
has also in the matter of Sandana Rene Lucien Joseph -Vs- Sandana
Vincent Maria Anthony8, has held that lex situs, namely, the law of the land
would apply when it comes to immovable properties and therefore the suit
for partition is maintainable.
(c) Further, the Notaires of France, also do not posses territorial jurisdiction
to carry out the partition of the properties situate in India. Since all the
properties were located only in Puducherry,          neither party filed any
proceeding before the Notaire, and rightly so. Even under French law, if the
Community properties are located in other Jurisdictions, the parties will have
to approach the concerned Courts as per local law and obtain property
remedy(partition).             Thus, the suit for partition is maintainable by the
principle of renvoi also. To quote Mr. A.M. Setalvad 9, is also of the view
that Indian Courts are likely to apply the rules of renvoi.
22. There is yet another reason why the argument of the Husband is
without any substance,because a proper reading of Article 1443 and 1444
would make it clear that upon dissolution of the community, any voluntary
separation of property is void and it should be through Court. Even the
order of separation of property that is ordered by court should be carried
out within the time stipulated, that is, by initiating proceedings within 3
months and concluding the same within one year. To quote Justice David
Annoussamy10, “In all cases in which the matter is not settled amicably
with the help of a notaire and the parties go to court, the respective
advocate would seek the strict application of rules with all their
complexity, which will be a ruinous process”. Thus, it may be seen that
even in France, the parties have still an option to go to the Court, if they do
not agree with the Notaire's decision. Finally, a proper reading of Article
1444 only says that if there is an order of separation, which is made by the
9 A.M. Setalvad, Conflict of Laws, Lexis Nexis, 3rd Edn, Page 373
National Law Schol of India University, Bangalore, 2nd Edn – page 292
Court, and if the parties do not carry out the liquidation by approaching
Notary within the period of three months, it is that order of separation of
property, which will be void. Therefore, once again, the parties are entitled
to approach for separation and the properties in the instant case, having been
located in India, the respondent has rightly approached the Court of law, for
partition and separate possession, as Article 1444 does not in any manner
override the effect of Article 1441, resulting the ending of the community
status.
23. For all the reasons stated above, the question is answered in
favour of the respondent/plaintiff that the present suit filed by the
respondent/plaintiff, wife, for partition and separate possession of the
property, as per Indian laws is maintainable and will not be barred by virtue
of not approaching French Notary for liquidation under Article 1444 of the
24. For the conclusions reached by us as above, in respect of issue No.
1, we confirm the finding of the trial court that the plaintiff is entitled to file
the suit for partition as against the defendant claiming half share in the suit
properties; in respect of issue No. 2 & 3 we find that the schedule properties
formed part of the communate legale of both parties; In respect of issue No.
4 that the plaintiff is entitled to claim half share in the suit properties and in
respect of issue No. 5 that the plaintiff wife will be entitled to a preliminary
decree for partition and we answer the issue accordingly.
25. In the result, the present Appeal Suit is dismissed. The decree and
judgment dated 30.01.2017 made in O.S.No.4 of 2013, on the file of the
learned Family Court Judge, Puducherry is confirmed. However, the parties
shall bear their own costs.
