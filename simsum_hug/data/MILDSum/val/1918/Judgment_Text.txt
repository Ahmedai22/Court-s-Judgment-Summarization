This appeal has been filed by the complainant in C.C No.1577 of 2003
on the file of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court, Muvattupuzha
challenging the acquittal of the 2nd respondent who was accused of an
offence under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act.             The
complaint was filed alleging that the 2nd respondent herein had in the
discharge of a debt, issued cheque No.327388 dated 30.12.2000 drawn on
the Catholic Syrian Bank, Koothattukulam branch for a sum of Rs.1,70,000/-
and on presentation, the said cheque was returned unpaid on the ground of
insufficiency    of   funds  in   the  account   maintained     by  the   2 nd
respondent/accused. The complaint was filed after statutory notice and
complying with all other formalities.
2.     The appellant/complainant was examined as PW1 and Exts.P1
to P11 were marked. From the side of the 2nd respondent/accused, DW's 1 to
3 were examined and D1 to D7 were marked.
3.     The learned Magistrate, on a consideration of the matter found
that the complainant had failed to prove his case and accordingly, acquitted
the 2nd respondent/accused.
4.     Sri.Peeyus A. Kottam, the learned counsel appearing for the
appellant would submit that the circumstances which led to the finding that
the complainant has not proved his case can be seen (in summary) from
paragraph 21 of the impugned judgment. He submits that the finding of the
learned Magistrate that cheque No.327388 was issued before 5.6.1995 at the
time when the complainant had advanced a loan of Rs.40,000/- to the 2 nd
respondent/accused is incorrect. According to him, the circumstances taken
into account by the learned Magistrate was that there was evidence to show
that cheque bearing No.327387 was presented on 23.05.1995, cheque
bearing No.327392 was presented on 10.06.1995, cheque bearing No.327393
was presented on 05.06.1995 and cheque bearing No.327397 was presented
on 17.07.1995 and that the entire cheque book was exhausted on 07.02.1996.
Further, a new cheque book was found to be issued on 29.03.1996 and the
accused presented cheque leaf-bearing No.238249 (from the new cheque
book) on 29.03.1996. The learned counsel for the appellant/complainant
would submit that even according to the case put forth by the 2 nd
respondent/accused, a cheque bearing No.327387 was presented for
encashment on 23.05.1995, whereas the date of the earlier loan admittedly
availed by the accused from the complainant is 18.04.1995.      From this,
according to the learned counsel for the complainant, it is clear that the
cheque bearing No.327388 (the subject cheque) could not have been issued
for the loan availed on 18.04.1995. He would submit that the learned
Magistrate went wrong in assuming that a new loan of Rs.1,70,000/- would
not have been granted when the old loan was outstanding and that the
amount of loan of Rs.1,70,000/- would not have been given in cash when the
earlier loan of Rs.40,000/- was given by way of cheque. He submits that the
learned Magistrate should have accepted the case of the complainant that the
loan of Rs.1,70,000/- was given in personal capacity. He submits that there
was no warrant for the learned Magistrate to assume that the cheque was a
blank cheque given as security for the earlier loan. D2 and D3 documents do
not, according to the learned counsel, go against the case of the Complainant.
The learned counsel also contends that there was nothing illegal in giving a
personal loan just because the business of the complainant is that of money
lending. The learned counsel for the appellant would rely on the judgment of
the Supreme Court in Rohitbhai Jivanlal Patel v. State of Gujarat,
(2019) 18 SCC 106 to contend that the principle that the appellate court
would be slow in setting aside a judgment of acquittal that two views are
possible could not be applicable in the case of a prosecution under Section
138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act.        He would further rely on the
judgment     of the    Supreme Court      in  M.    Abbas      Haji  v.   T.N.
Channakeshava, (2019) 9 SCC 606 to contend that failure to explain as
to how the cheque in question reached the hands of the complainant is fatal
to the defence. He also relies on the judgment of the Supreme Court in APS
Forex Services (P) Ltd. v. Shakti International Fashion Linkers,
(2020) 12 SCC 724 to contend that where the issuance of the cheque and
the signatures are not disputed, the presumptions under the Negotiable
Instruments Act will kick in and for the proposition and that it was wrong to
shift the burden of proving the existence of a liability to the complainant. In
other words, according to the learned Counsel, the presumption under
Section 139 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, though rebuttable, should
have operated in favour of the Complainant in the total absence of any
acceptable evidence to rebut that presumption from the side of the defence.
5.     The learned counsel for the 2nd respondent/accused would rely
on the judgment of this Court in Joshy P G v. Jose Varghese and
Another, 2019 (4) KHC 753 to contend that where an accused in a
prosecution under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act has fairly
and reasonably established that the case put up by the complainant is highly
improbable, the complainant cannot rely on the statutory presumption any
longer. He would also refer to the Division Bench judgment of this Court in
Basheer K v. C.K.Usman Koya and Another, 2021 (2) KHC 432 for
the proposition that where the accused has succeeded in rebutting the
presumption under the Negotiable Instruments Act, the burden shifts to the
complainant to prove consideration and on failure to do so, the accused is
entitled to be acquitted.
6.     I have considered the contentions raised. The first circumstance
taken into account by the learned Magistrate to hold that the 2 nd
respondent/accused was entitled to an acquittal is the fact that cheque
No.327388(the subject cheque) could not have been one which was issued
close to the time at which it was stated to have been issued. According to the
appellant/complainant, the loan of Rs.1,70,000/- was given on 26.12.2000
and in the discharge of this debt, the subject cheque bearing No.327388 was
issued on 30.12.2000. Based on the evidence tendered by the 2 nd
respondent/accused, the learned Magistrate found that immediately
previous cheque, namely cheque bearing No.327387 was presented for
encashment on 23.05.1995, that cheque bearing No.327392 was presented
for encashment on 10.06.1995 and cheque bearing No.327397 was presented
for encashment on 17.07.1995. The learned Magistrate took note of the fact
that the entire cheque book, which also contained the subject cheque bearing
No.327388, was exhausted on 07.02.1996 and a new cheque book was issued
on 29.03.1996 and further that the 2nd respondent/accused had presented
the cheque bearing No.238249 from the new cheque book on 29.03.1996.
The aforesaid findings of the learned Magistrate based on Ext.D4 passbook
of the accused cannot be faulted. The mere fact the cheque bearing
No.327387 (the subject cheque bears the No.327388) was presented for
encashment only on 23.05.1995 and the fact that the earlier loan admittedly
availed by the accused from the complainant is 18.04.1995 does not, in any
manner, suggest that the subject cheque was not issued as a security for the
loan availed on 18.4.1995. There may have been many reasons for the earlier
cheque having been presented later. Considering the totality of the evidence,
I think that the case put forth by the 2 nd respondent/accused cannot be
disbelieved, as it is the admitted case that there was a transaction between
the parties in the year 1995 as is evident from the fact that an amount of
Rs.40,000/- was credited to the account of the 2 nd respondent/accused
through cheques issued by the complainant on 18.04.1995 and 29.04.1995.
The loan of Rs.1,70,000/- was reportedly given on 26.12.2000. It is highly
improbable that a cheque leaf from a cheque book that got exhausted on
07.02.1996 would have been used on 30.12.2000 in the discharge of a
liability for a loan taken on 26.12.2000.       Therefore, I am in complete
agreement with the view taken by the learned Magistrate that there is
evidence to show that the cheque in question was not issued in discharge of
the alleged liability of Rs.1,70,000/-.
7.    The learned Magistrate has also found from Exts.D2 and D3 that
the earlier loan stood discharged. Though the appellant/complainant
disputed the fact that the earlier loan had been discharged, the learned
Magistrate found from Exts.D2 and D3 receipts that the signature of the
appellant/complainant stood proved.         A comparison of the admitted
signature of the appellant/complainant with the signatures in Exts. D2 and
D3 was clearly an exercise authorized under Section 73 of the Indian
8.       As rightly held by the learned Magistrate there is no admission
of repayment of the loan amount of Rs.40,000/- on 26.12.2000. The
statement that another loan of Rs.1,70,000/- was given in cash by the
appellant/complainant, who was admittedly a money lender at the time
when the earlier loan of Rs.40,000/- remained unpaid was clearly a
circumstance that could be taken note of in concluding that the 2 nd
transaction (loan of Rs.1,70,000/-) was quite improbable. The case of
appellant/complainant       that   the   second    transaction   with   the     2 nd
respondent/accused was in his personal capacity was only to get over the
defence of the 2nd respondent/accused that he had discharged the earlier
liability and that there was no further liability subsisting to be paid off to the
9.       The    documents     produced    by   the   appellant/complainant
(Exts.P9 Daybook, P8 DPN register and P10 & P11 Counterfoils of receipts
book) were also not accepted by the learned Magistrate, as the details of the
earlier loan which was admittedly paid by cheque were also not entered in
10.   I think that this is a case where the 2nd respondent/accused has
been successful in rebutting the statutory presumption under Section 139 of
the Negotiable Instruments Act. The fact that there was an earlier
transaction in the year 1995 and that liability had been settled by repayment
is a factor which would lend credence to the case of the 2 nd
respondent/accused that Ext.P1 cheque was one issued as security in the
discharge of that liability and such cheque was misused by the
appellant/complainant to make it appear that there was a subsequent
transaction. In the totality of the facts and circumstance of this case, this
Court should not interfere with the findings rendered by the trial court. As
held by this Court in Basheer K (supra) when the accused has succeeded in
rebutting the presumption, it is for the complainant to prove the existence of
a debt in the discharge of which the subject cheque was issued. I have found
that the 2nd respondent/accused has succeeded in showing that the statutory
presumption under Section 139 of the Negotiable Instruments Act should not
be applied. In other words the 2nd respondent/accused has been able to rebut
the statutory presumption. The appellant/complainant has not thereafter
been able to bring in any evidence suggesting the existence of a transaction
resulting in a legally enforcible debt payable by 2 nd respondent/accused.
Therefore, the prosecution of the 2 nd respondent/accused under Section 138
of the Negotiable Instruments Act must necessarily fail. The decisions cited
at the bar by the learned counsel for the appellant, do not support his case
especially when this Court is of the view that the 2 nd respondent/accused has
succeeded in rebutting the statutory presumption under Section 139 of the
Negotiable Instruments Act. Appeal fails and will stand dismissed.
