petitioner/accused No.3 and Crl.P.No.4451/2022 is filed by
the petitioners/accused Nos.1 and 2 under section 482 of
Cr.P.C for quashing the criminal proceedings against them
in CC.No.30741/2021 pending on the file of VIII ACMM,
Bengaluru, for the offence punishable under Sections 499
2. Heard the argument of learned counsel for both
3.    The    case   of  the   petitioners      is  that    the
respondent/complainant       who   is  an     advocate      filed   a
complaint    under    section   200   of     Cr.P.C     before    the
Magistrate for the offence punishable under Section 499 of
IPC and the learned Magistrate previously dismissed the
complaint on 2.2.2019.          Thereafter, the complainant
approached the Sessions Court under section 397 of Cr.P.C
by filing revision petition and the revisional Court had set
aside   the  order    of  dismissal   of    the    complaint     and
remanded the matter back to the Magistrate to take
cognizance against the petitioners.      Subsequently, the
learned Magistrate have taken the cognizance and issued
the process, under section 204 of Cr.P.C which is under
challenge before this court.
4.  The complainant has averred in the complaint
that the petitioner/accused No.3 is a practicing advocate at
Dakshina Kannada. The accused Nos.1 and 2 (petitioners
in Crl.P.No.4451/2022) have engaged the service of
accused No.3 for filing objections/written statement before
the Upalokayuktha in a complaint against the accused
Nos.1 and 2, wherein the accused No.3 filed a statement of
objections by making defamatory allegation against the
complainant, with an intention to tarnish the image of the
complainant. Therefore, he has filed the complaint before
the Magistrate and also said to have filed a civil suit for
claiming damages of Rs.1 crore which is pending in the
5.  The learned counsel for the petitioner who is
appearing for accused No.3, has contended that this
petitioner is an advocate practicing at Dakshina Kannada,
he has filed statement of objection on behalf of his client,
i.e., accused nos.1 and 2 and there is no personal interest
or no intention to tarnish the image of the complainant.
The accused Nos.1 and 2 were running the quarry business
and the complainant had filed a public interest litigation
and later withdrawn the same. Subsequently, complainant
filed a complaint to the Lokayuktha and this petitioner
appeared as an advocate. Therefore, there is no criminal
intention to defame the complainant, he has only acted in
a good faith for protecting his client, therefore, the
advocate cannot be held for defamation.           The entire
documents should be looked into and it should not be pick
and choose of Men's Rea or criminal intention to defame
the    complainant.   Hence,     prayed   for  quashing  the
complaint against the accused No.3.
6. The learned counsel for the petitioners/accused
Nos.1 and 2 also taken similar contention that the
complainant already filed civil suit for Rs.1 crore damages,
now the suit is in the stage for evidence.        There is no
allegation or statement made by these accused in order to
attract Sections 499 or 500 of IPC. Exception of 5 and 9 of
the Section 499 of IPC, there is protection available to
these petitioners.    Further contended the advocate filed
objection, they have not obtained signatures of the
accused Nos.1 and 2, therefore, the question of punishing
the accused Nos.1 and 2 does not arises.        Hence prayed
for quashing the criminal proceedings against them.
7.    Per contra, learned counsel for the respondent
has contended, whether there is intention or Mens rea to
defame the complainant, is matter of trial.       The accused
Nos.3 has acted as a counsel for the accused Nos.1 and 2
and    accused No.3 alone signed the written statement.
The complainant is an advocate and he has put in 41 years
of practice.      The complainant also has filed a public
interest litigation and as per the direction of the High court
he has withdrawn the writ petition and approached the
Upalokayuktha. In the said proceedings the accused Nos.1
to   3   filed  written    statement   by  making  damaging
statement, which attracts defamation.        The complainant
being an advocate should have been very careful in
preparing statement of objection while making defamatory
allegation against the complainant, therefore the matter is
required for trial and they can take defense in the cross
examination independently. The accused No.3 whether he
himself acted and mentioned the averments in the written
statement of objection, or at the instruction of accused
Nos.1 and 2 he has made such allegation, are all to be
considered only after the trial. Therefore, at this stage, it
is not fit case for quashing the criminal proceedings, hence
prayed for dismissing the petition.
8. Heard the arguments of both parties and perused
the records. The allegation against accused Nos.1 to 3 is
that the complainant who is a practicing advocate filed a
public    interest  litigation  before   the High  Court  of
Karnataka, to stop the stone quarry/mining of the accused
Nos.1 and 2. It is an admitted fact that the High Court of
Karnataka    disposed    of   the   matter    by   directing  the
petitioners to approach Upalokayuktha.            Accordingly a
complaint has been filed before Upalokayuktha and in that
proceedings    the   accused     No.3   who    is  an   advocate
appeared before the Upalokayuktha on behalf of the
accused Nos.1 and 2.         It is an admitted fact that the
accused Nos.1 and 2 filed statement of objection through
accused No.3, it is also an admitted fact that the accused
No.3   filed  statement     of   objection    without   obtaining
signatures of the accused Nos.1 and 2. It is alleged by the
accused     No.3   in   the     statement     of   objection    in
Uplok/Mys/1720/2017         that     a     proceeding      before
Upalokayuktha in the statement of objection at Para 6 he
has stated, where the complainant          filed a writ petition
before the High Court in WP No.39001/2015 and the
complainant in the habit of filing the writ petitions against
the accused Nos.1 and 2 by using the tactics to threaten
the accused Nos.1 and 2 and used to get the money and
thereafter withdraw the writ petitions.          He has further
contended, the complainant filed one more writ petition in
W.P.No.3221/2016 before the High Court with an intention
to extort money from the accused Nos.1 and 2 and when
the accused Nos.1 and 2 did not agree to pay any money
therefore, through writ petition he has filed complaint
before the Lokayuktha.       Subsequently, the complainant
also made a demand from the accused Nos.1 and 2 and
not able to get money, hence he has filed the complaint
before the Lokayuktha. On perusal of these statements, it
categorically reveals it is a defamatory statement against
the complainant by the accused Nos.1 to 3.       Therefore,
now it cannot be bifurcated whether the accused No.3
himself written those defamatory statement against the
complainant or he has prepared objections only on
instruction of accused Nos.1 and 2, since the statement of
objections were not signed by the accused Nos.1 and 2.
The accused No.3 alone filed these statement of objections
by signing himself on behalf of accused Nos.1 and 2.
Therefore, accused Nos.1 and 2 in one side and accused
No.3 in another side cannot blame each other for making
such a defamatory statement against complainant stating
that the complainant is in the habit of extorting money
from the accused Nos.1 and 2 by filing the writ petitions
and demanding money for withdrawing the PIL, thereafter
he has filed another PIL and made a demand of money
when the same was failed, he has used the tactics to file
complaint before the Lokayuktha etc., It cannot be said
there is no intention or Men's Rea to tarnish the image of
complainant by the accused persons.
9. It is also seen from the order of the Sessions
Judge, as the Sessions Judge categorically gone through
the records and clearly come to the conclusion that there
is a prima facie case made against the accused persons for
framing of charge. The averments made by the accused or
defamatory statement made by the accused will not fall
under the exception of the section 499 of IPC as the
statement made by the accused No.3 cannot be said to be
in a good faith while conducting the trial or proceedings.
The accused No.3 is a practicing advocate and he himself
drafted the objection on behalf of the accused Nos.1 and 2
and he himself is aware about the consequences about the
statement of objections filed before the public authority in
a court of law. Therefore, without going to the trial, this
Court cannot jump into the conclusion, there is no
defamatory statement made by the accused persons or
there is no criminal intention or Mens Rea to defame the
complainant, therefore, matter is required for trial. I have
gone through the judgments produced by the petitioners
which will not be applicable to the case on hand.
In view of the above findings the judgment relied by
the respondent is not required to be considered in detail at
this stage.
Therefore, both the petitions are devoid of merits
and is liable to dismissed.
Accordingly, both petitions filed by accused Nos.1 to
3 are hereby dismissed.
