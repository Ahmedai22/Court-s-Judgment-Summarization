The Supreme Court, on Monday, granted bail to an under trial who is in jail for more than 12 years in connection with a crime registered in 2009. "We are appalled to notice that the appellant is in jail in connection with the crime registered by FIR No. 226 of 2009 for more than 12 years and the trial is still not concluded. ", the bench comprising Justices AM Khanwilkar, BR Gavai and Krishna Murari said while granting bail to Rakesh Mishra, an accused in a murder case. The bench, therefore, 'in the interest of justice',Â  directed that he be released on bail to the satisfaction of the Trial Court on such terms and conditions as may be imposed by it. The court further directed the Trial Court to ensure that the trial is concluded not later than six months from receipt of copy of the order. The court was considering an appeal against the order passed by Calcutta High Court in the bail petition filed by him on the ground that his father recently expired.
