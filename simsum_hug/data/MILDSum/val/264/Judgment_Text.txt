The petition has been heard by way of video conferencing.
1.    The present petition has been filed by the petitioner challenging
the notice dated 30.03.2019 issued by the respondent under Section
148 of the Income Tax Act, 1961 (hereinafter referred to as the ‘Act’)
and all consequential proceedings emanating therefrom including
orders passed by the Assessing Officer.
2.    The petitioner is the son of Late Sh. Bhanger Singh Tanwar
(hereinafter referred to as the ‘Assessee’) who died on 14.01.2016.
3.    The impugned notice under Section 148 of the Act was issued
in the name of the Assessee. The petitioner claims that he did not
WP(C) No.9227/2021                                          Page 1 of 7
receive the said notice. Subsequently, notice dated 30.10.2019 under
Section 142(1) of the Act was again issued in the name of the
Assessee. As no response was received to these notices, a Show
Cause Notice dated 15.12.2019 was issued to the Assessee. Finally, an
assessment order dated 23.12.2019 was passed against the Assessee.
Notice dated 01.02.2020 under Section 221(1) and notice dated
05.07.2021 under Section 271(1) (b) of the Act were also issued in the
name of the Assessee.
4.     The petitioner has challenged the above notices and proceedings
on the ground that they were initiated against a person who had died
prior to the issuance of notice and therefore, all proceedings are void
ab initio.
5.     On the other hand, the learned counsel for the respondent
submits that notice under Section 148 of the Act was issued at the
same address of the Assessee which is available in the ITD data base.
The said notice was duly served as it was never received back by the
respondent. Thereafter, notice under Section 142 (1) was issued on
30.10.2019 at the same address and was served by the postal agencies.
As no response to the communications was received, a Show Cause
Notice dated 15.12.2019 under Section 144 of the Act was issued and
sent again at the same address. Assessment order under Section 144
of the Act was thereafter passed on 23.12.2019 making an addition of
Rs.48,53,000/ under Section 69A of the Act being unexplained cash
deposit. Penalty proceedings under Sections 271(1) (c), 271(1)(b) and
271F were also initiated by issuing a Show Cause Notice, again served
at the same address. Though, all the correspondences to the Assessee
WP(C) No.9227/2021                                       Page 2 of 7
were made through speed post, none of the correspondence prior to the
assessment order dated 23.12.2019 was received back through postal
agency in the office of the respondent. Only the assessment order was
received back with the remark that the addressee had died.
6.     The learned counsel for the respondent submits that the factum
of death of the Assessee was never communicated to the respondent
by the legal heirs, though the notices were duly served at the given
address. He submits that the petitioner, therefore, has an alternate
efficacious remedy in form of a statutory appeal and this Court should
refuse to entertain the present petition.
7.     We have considered the submissions made by the learned
counsels for the parties.
8.     The issue of validity of a notice and proceedings held
subsequent thereto against a dead person is no longer res integra. This
Court in Savita Kapila vs. Assistant Commissioner of Income-Tax, in
W.P. (C) No.3258/2020 has held as under:
24. Further, the fact that an assessment order
has been passed and it is open to challenge by
way of an appeal, does not denude the
WP(C) No.9227/2021                                              Page 3 of 7
petitioner of its right to challenge the notice
for assessment if it is without jurisdiction. If
the assumption of jurisdiction is wrong, the
assessment order passed subsequent would
have no legs to stand. If the notice goes, so
does the order of assessment. It is trite law that
if the Assessing Officer had no jurisdiction to
initiate assessment proceeding, the mere fact
that subsequent orders have been passed
would not render the challenge to jurisdiction
infructuous.
26. In the opinion of this Court the issuance of
a notice under Section 148 of the Act is the
foundation for reopening of an assessment.
Consequently, the sine qua non for acquiring
jurisdiction to reopen an assessment is that
such notice should be issued in the name of the
correct person. This requirement of issuing
notice to a correct person and not to a dead
person is not merely a procedural requirement
but is a condition precedent to the impugned
notice being valid in law. [See Sumit
Balkrishna Gupta v. Asst. Commissioner of
27. xxxxx Consequently, in view of the above, a
reopening notice under Section 148 of the Act,
WP(C) No.9227/2021                                                 Page 4 of 7
1961 issued in the name of a deceased
assessee is null and void.
30. Section 159 of the Act, 1961 applies to a
situation      where       proceedings         are
initiated/pending against the assessee when he
is alive and after his death the legal
representative steps into the shoes of the
deceased assessee. Since that is not the present
factual scenario, Section 159 of the Act, 1961
does not apply to the present case.
32. This Court is of the view that in the
absence of a statutory provision it is difficult to
cast a duty upon the legal representatives to
intimate the factum of death of an assessee to
the income tax department. After all, there may
be cases where the legal representatives are
estranged from the deceased assessee or the
deceased assessee may have bequeathed his
entire wealth to a charity. Consequently,
whether PAN record was updated or not or
whether the Department was made aware by
the legal representatives or not is irrelevant. In
760 – Madras High Court] it has been held
WP(C) No.9227/2021                                                  Page 5 of 7
“nothing has been placed before this Court by
the Revenue to show that there is a statutory
obligation on the part of the legal
representatives of the deceased assessee to
immediately intimate the death of the assessee
or take steps to cancel the PAN registration.”
34. Consequently, the legal heirs are under no
statutory obligation to intimate the death of the
assessee to the Revenue.
35. This Court is of the opinion that issuance
of notice upon a dead person and non-service
of notice does not come under the ambit of
mistake, defect or omission. Consequently,
Section 292B of the Act, 1961 does not apply
to the present case.
38. This Court is also of the view that Section
292BB of the Act, 1961 is applicable to an
assessee and not to a legal representative.
Further, in the present case one of the legal
heirs of the deceased assessee, i.e. the
petitioner, had neither cooperated in the
WP(C) No.9227/2021                                                Page 6 of 7
assessment proceedings nor filed return or
waived the requirement of Section 148 of the
Act, 1961 or submitted to jurisdiction of the
Assessing Officer. She had merely uploaded
the death certificate of the deceased assessee.
40. Consequently, the applicability of Section
292BB of the Act, 1961 has been held to be
attracted to an assessee and not to legal
representatives.”
9.    The above judgment was followed by this Court in W.P.(C)
No.2678/2020 titled Mrs. Sripathi Subbaraya Manohara L/H Late
Sripathi Subbaraya Gupta vs. Principal Commissioner of Income
10.   In the present case also, as the notice under Section 148 of the
Act was issued against a dead person, the same is null and void and all
consequent proceedings/orders, including the assessment order and the
subsequent notices, being equally tainted, are liable to be set aside.
11.   Consequently, the impugned notice dated 30.03.2019 issued
under Section 148 of the Act is set aside along with all consequential
proceedings/notices/assessment orders.
12.   The petition is allowed. There shall be no order as to costs.
