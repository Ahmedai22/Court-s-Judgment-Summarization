1.         In this appeal, the appellant challenges the judgment and
order dated 01.04.2021 passed in Sessions Case No.87 of 2016 by
the learned Sessions Judge, Gadchiroli, whereby the learned Judge
convicted the appellant (accused no.1) for the offence punishable
under Section 304B of the Indian Penal Code (for short, ‘IPC’) and
sentenced him to undergo rigorous imprisonment for ten years and
pay fine of ₹25,000/-, in default to undergo further simple
imprisonment for six months.
2.     Informant-Suresh Khobragade, who is father of deceased
Shefali lodged report on 19.06.2016 against the appellant and
remaining four accused. The learned Sessions Judge acquitted
accused nos.2,3 and 5. Accused no.4 died during pendency of the
trial and therefore prosecution abated against her. Acquitted accused
no.2 is the brother of the appellant. Acquitted accused no.3 is the
brother-in-law of the appellant. Deceased accused no.4 is the
mother of the appellant. Acquitted accused no.5 is the sister of the
appellant. There was love affair between the appellant and deceased
Shefali. Deceased Shefali and appellant on 05.06.2016 by
maintaining utmost secrecy performed the marriage at Markanda
temple. The appellant and the informant are the resident of
Gadchiroli. After marriage, deceased Shefali went to stay with the
appellant at the house of Pallavi (accused no.5). Informant and his
family members did not like the marriage and therefore severed all
ties with deceased Shefali.
3.     It is the case of the prosecution that after 4 to 5 months of the
marriage, the appellant and the acquitted accused started ill-treating
deceased Shefali. The appellant and his family members told the
deceased that if her father had performed her marriage, he would
have spent near about five to six lakh rupees. The love marriage has
saved the money of the father of deceased Shefali. Therefore, they
insisted deceased Shefali to bring five to six lakh rupees from her
father as dowry. The appellant and his family members wanted to
construct upper floor of the house therefore they needed money.
Deceased Shefali was caught in precarious position inasmuch as she
had married with appellant against wish of her parents. One day,
deceased Shefali made a phone call to her mother and informed her
that the appellant and other accused are making demand of five to
six lakh rupees towards dowry. She further informed that on
account of this demand she was subjected to ill-treatment and
cruelty. On 27.05.2016, the mother of the deceased called her to the
house of her neighbour Lalita Sonpipre. On 27.05.2016, there was
birthday celebration of the son of Lalita Sonpipre. Under the pretext
of attending birthday, deceased Shefali came to the house of Lalita
Sonpipre. Mother of the deceased and deceased Shefali met there.
The deceased told her mother that her in-laws are demanding five to
six lakh rupees towards dowry for construction of upper floor of the
house. On that count she was subjected to mental and physical
harassment. She narrated this in presence of Lalita Sonpipre. After
sometime, husband of deceased went there and picked-up deceased
Shefali with him to his house. On 29.05.2016, the dead body of
deceased Shefali was found in the village pond. The police conveyed
this information to the informant and his family members. They
went to the hospital and saw the dead body.
4.     The appellant on 29.05.2016 at about 15:00 hours went to the
Police Station and lodged the missing report of deceased Shefali.
However, by that time, dead body of deceased Shefali was found in
the pond. On the basis of this report, a Merg bearing No.30/2016
was registered. The police recovered the dead body of Shefali and
performed inquest panchanama of the dead body. The police
forwarded dead body of Shefali to Government Hospital for
postmortem. The Medical Officer on the basis of observations at the
time of postmortem reserved his opinion subject to the viscera
report.
5.     The informant and his family members were not informed by
the appellant and his family members, when deceased Shefali
allegedly went missing. The informant and his family members,
therefore, became suspicious that deceased Shefali was killed by the
appellant and his family members. He therefore went to Police
Station, Gadchiroli on 30.05.2016 to lodge report. The police
refused to take the report. On 31.05.2016, he forwarded the report
by speed post to Gadchiroli Police Station but there was no
response. Therefore, the informant went to the Superintendent of
Police, Gadchiroli on 06.06.2016. After great persuasion on
19.06.2016 his report was recorded at Gadchiroli Police Station. On
the basis of his report, a Crime bearing No.116/2016 came to be
registered for the offence punishable under Section 304B read with
Section 34 of the IPC against the appellant and the reaming
accused. The Investigating Officer recorded the statements of the
witnesses. He obtained the opinion of the Medical Officer. The
Medical Officer categorically stated that death was due to
strangulation with postmortem drowning. After investigation,
charge-sheet came to be filed. On committal of the case, the learned
Sessions Judge framed the charge against the appellant and other
accused for the offence punishable under Section 304B read with
Section 34 of the IPC. The alternate charge was framed under
Section 302 read with Section 34 of the IPC.
6.     The prosecution examined in all 12 witnesses. The prosecution
relied upon number of documents. The learned Sessions Judge on
consideration of the evidence, found the appellant alone guilty for
the offence punishable under Section 304B of the IPC. Remaining
accused were acquitted. Being aggrieved by conviction and sentence
the appellant is before this Court in appeal.
7.           I have heard Shri Abdul Subhan, learned advocate for the
appellant and Shri M.J. Khan, learned APP for respondent/State.
Perused the record and proceedings.
8.           The learned advocate for the appellant submitted that
prosecution has failed to establish the basic ingredients of Section
304B of the IPC. Learned advocate submitted that the evidence
adduced by the prosecution is not sufficient to prove the charge
against the appellant. Learned advocate pointed out that on the
basis of the identical evidence learned Sessions Judge has granted
benefit of doubt to the remaining accused and acquitted them.
Learned advocate submitted that on the basis of same evidence,
learned Judge should not have convicted and sentenced the
appellant. Learned advocate submitted that the informant and his
family members had grudge against the appellant and his family
members because daughter of the informant deceased Shefali had
eloped with the appellant and performed marriage against their
wish. The learned advocate took me through the evidence of the
informant and his wife i.e. mother of deceased Shefali and
submitted that their evidence is not sufficient to prove the guilt of
the appellant. Learned advocate submitted that on material aspects
there are omissions, contradictions and inconsistencies in their
evidence. As far as the remaining witnesses are concerned, the
learned advocate submitted that their evidence is not sufficient to
corroborate the evidence of the informant (PW1) and mother of
deceased Shefali (PW3). Learned advocate took me through the
evidence of PW6 and submitted that this witness was brought on
scene to rope-in the appellant and his family members. The learned
advocate submitted that number of prohibition cases have been
registered against PW6 at Gadchiroli Police Station. It is therefore
submitted that in order to oblige the police for favour, PW6
concocted a story which is totally unbelievable. Learned advocate
while commenting on the evidence of the Medical Officer
submitted that initially the Medical Officer was not able to give
opinion as to the cause of death. Learned advocate submitted that
the opinion as to the cause of death obtained later on was in
connivance with the police and the informant. Learned advocate
submitted that the learned Sessions Judge has committed a mistake
in convicting the appellant.
9.           Learned APP Shri M.J.Khan, submitted that the evidence
adduced by prosecution is a cogent and reliable. He submitted that
on the basis of this evidence, the prosecution has proved guilt
against the appellant beyond reasonable doubt. Learned APP
submitted that there was no reason for deceased Shefali to make
false complaint against the appellant and his family members and so
for the informant to falsely implicate them. Learned APP submitted
that the cause of death namely strangulation with postmortem
drowning, indicates that the deceased was killed and her dead body
was thrown in the village pond. Learned APP submitted that
fortunately for the appellant he has escaped the dragnet of the
offence under Section 302 of the IPC. The learned APP submitted
that deceased Shefali died within 5 to 6 months of her marriage.
Learned APP submitted that there is ample evidence to prove that
the demand of dowry was made by the appellant and his family
members. Learned APP in short supported the judgment and order
passed by the learned Sessions Judge.
10.          In order to appreciate rival submissions, I have minutely
perused the evidence on record. Learned Sessions Judge, as can be
seen from the judgment and order has not at all considered the
charge framed under Section 302 read with Section 34 of the IPC.
No finding has been recorded one way or the other. There is no
order of acquittal of the appellant and remaining accused for the
offence punishable under Section 302 read with Section 34 of the
IPC. It is seen that on the basis of materials compiled in the charge-
sheet and the medical evidence, charge under Section 302 read with
Section 34 of the IPC was framed as an alternate charge by the
learned Sessions Judge. The charge was framed on 12.01.2018. The
first witness was examined on 03.05.2018. The last witness was
examined on 21.08.2019. After examination of the last witness, on
04.11.2019, the incharge of the Gadchiroli Police Station had
forwarded postmortem notes, query report and viscera analysis
report to the Civil Surgeon, Gadchiroli with request to give final
opinion as to cause of death. The final opinion was given on
04.11.2019. The Panel of Doctors opined that the cause of death was
strangulation with postmortem drowning. On receipt of this
opinion, the prosecution made a request to recall the Medical
Officer. The application was allowed and Medical Officer was
examined. The accused persons by taking benefit of this order of
allowing prosecution to place on record the final opinion of cause of
death, cross-examined remaining witnesses. It is to be noted that
learned Sessions Judge at the time of granting application for taking
final opinion as to cause of death on record and granting the
permission to examine the medical officer, was expected to modify
and/or alter the charge. In view of this concrete opinion the charge
under Section 302 of the IPC ought to have been a principal charge
against all the accused. It is seen from the record that learned
Sessions Judge, by exercising powers under Section 216 of the Code
of Criminal Procedure, did not alter or frame the additional charge
for principal offence under Section 302 of the IPC. It is seen that
the learned Sessions Judge completely ignored the opinion of the
medical officer as to the cause of death. The opinion of cause of
death clearly indicated that deceased Shefali was killed and
thereafter her dead body was thrown in the village pond.
11.          It would be profitable in the above context to consider the
judicial pronouncement of the Hon’ble Supreme Court in the case
of Vijay Pal Sing and others Vs. State of Uttarakhand reported in
(2014) 15 SCC 163. Paragraphs 18, 19 and 20 would be important
“18.However, it is generally seen that in cases where a married
woman dies within seven years of marriage, otherwise than
under normal circumstances, no inquiry is usually conducted
to see whether there is evidence, direct or circumstantial, as to
whether the offence falls under Section 302 of IPC.
Sometimes, Section 302 of IPC is put as an alternate charge.
In cases where there is evidence, direct or circumstantial, to
show that the offence falls under Section 302 of IPC, the trial
court should frame the charge under Section 302 of IPC even
if the police has not expressed any opinion in that regard in
the report under Section 173(2) Cr.PC. Section 304B IPC can
be put as an alternate charge if the trial court so feels. In the
course of trial, if the court finds that there is no evidence,
direct or circumstantial, and proof beyond reasonable doubt is
not available to establish that the same is not homicide, in
such a situation, if the ingredients under Section 304-B IPC
are available, the trial court should proceed under the said
provision. In Muthu Kutty and another v. State, this Court
addressed the issue and held as follows:
"20. A reading of Section 304-B IPC and Section 113-B,
Evidence Act together makes it clear that law authorises a
presumption that the husband or any other relative of the
husband has caused the death of a woman if she happens to
die in circumstances not normal and that there was evidence
to show that she was treated with cruelty or harassed before
her death in connection with any demand for dowry. It,
therefore, follows that the husband or the relative, as the case
may be, need not be the actual or direct participant in the
commission of the offence of death. For those that are direct
participants in the commission of the offence of death there
are already provisions incorporated in Sections 300, 302 and
304. The provisions contained in Section 304-B IPC and
Section 113-B of the Evidence Act were incorporated on the
anvil of the Dowry Prohibition (Amendment) Act, 1984, the
main object of which is to curb the evil of dowry in the society
and to make it severely punitive in nature and not to extricate
husband’s or their relatives from the clutches of Section 302
IPC if they directly cause death. This conceptual difference
was not kept in view by the courts below. But that cannot
bring any relief if the conviction is altered to Section 304 Part
II. No prejudice is caused to the accused- appellants as they
were originally charged for offence punishable under Section
302 IPC along with Section 304-B IPC."
19. In a recent decision, this Court in Jasvinder Saini v. State
(Government of NCT of Delhi), observed thus:
"15. It is common ground that a charge under Section 304-B
IPC is not a substitute for a charge of murder punishable
under Section 302. As in the case of murder in every case
under Section 304-B also there is a death involved. The
question whether it is murder punishable under Section 302
IPC or a dowry death punishable under Section 304-B IPC
depends upon the fact situation and the evidence in the case.
If there is evidence whether direct or circumstantial to prima
facie support a charge under Section 302 IPC the trial court
can and indeed ought to frame a charge of murder punishable
under Section 302 IPC, which would then be the main charge
and not an alternative charge as is erroneously assumed in
some quarters. If the main charge of murder is not proved
against the accused at the trial, the court can look into the
evidence to determine whether the alternative charge of
dowry death punishable under Section 304-B is established.
The ingredients constituting the two offences are different,
thereby demanding appreciation of evidence from the
perspective relevant to such ingredients. The trial court in that
view of the matter acted mechanically for it framed an
additional charge under Section 302 IPC without adverting to
the evidence adduced in the case and simply on the basis of
the direction issued in Rajbir case. The High Court no doubt
made a half-hearted attempt to justify the framing of the
charge independent of the directions in Rajbir case, but it
would have been more appropriate to remit the matter back to
the trial court for fresh orders rather than lending support to it
in the manner done by the High Court."
20. Though in the instant case the accused were charged by
the Sessions Court under Section 302 IPC, it is seen that the
trial court has not made any serious attempt to make an
inquiry in that regard. If there is evidence available on
homicide in a case of dowry death, it is the duty of the
investigating officer to investigate the case under Section 302
IPC and the prosecution to proceed in that regard and the
court to approach the case in that perspective. Merely because
the victim is a married woman suffering an unnatural death
within seven years of marriage and there is evidence that she
was subjected to cruelty or harassment on account of demand
for dowry, the prosecution and the court cannot close its eyes
on the culpable homicide and refrain from punishing its
author, if there is evidence in that regard, direct or
circumstantial.”
12.          It is apparent that there was confusion with regard to the
offence of murder and the offence of dowry death in the mind of
learned Sessions Judge. It is to be noted that the offence of dowry
death is different from the offence of murder. A case of dowry death
may not necessarily be a murder. However in case of murder there
can be a dowry death. The ingredients of the offence of murder and
the ingredients of the offence of dowry death, as can be seen on
plain reading are totally different. The learned Sessions Judge as can
be seen has completely ignored this important aspect and proceeded
on the assumption that offence of dowry death would take in its fold
offence of murder.
13.          It is seen on perusal of the judgment that the learne
Sessions Judge did not frame a point for determination with regard
to the charge under Section 302 read with Section 34 of the IPC.
He did not discuss this charge in the judgment. In my view, this was
totally contrary to the express provision of law. The witnesses were
recalled after granting permission for taking final opinion of cause of
death on record. It is further seen that learned Sessions Judge has
accepted the case of prosecution that deceased Shefali died
homicidal death. In my view, this was the crux of the matter. In this
view of the matter, charge for murder ought to have been a principal
charge. The learned Sessions Judge somehow or the other has
missed this crux of the matter and committed grave error.
14.          It is to be noted that after re-examination of the medical
officer and bringing on record the final cause of death certificate, the
learned Judge was not only required to add or alter the charge but
consistent with the evidence on record put this important
circumstance to the accused persons in their examination under
Section 313 of the Code of Criminal Procedure statement. This
important evidence as to cause of death was not put to the accused
person in their examination under Section 313. It is seen that this
vital evidence has been made the basis of conviction and sentence of
appellant. It is to be noted that by way of precaution this Court has
recorded the statement of the appellant and put those circumstances
to him and sought his explanation at the stage of hearing of this
appeal.
15.          It is seen that this error committed by the learned Session
Judge has further been compounded by the prosecution. It is seen
that prosecution has accepted the judgment and order passed by the
learned Sessions Judge without any demur. At the trial stage, learned
prosecutor incharge of the case before the Sessions Court did not
apply for alteration or addition of the charge after obtaining the final
opinion of cause of death. The learned APP submitted that the State
has neither proposed nor filed appeal against order of acquittal of
the remaining accused. Learned APP further submitted that the
State has not made any grievance with regard to the manner in
which the mater was proceeded and decided vis-a-vis charge under
Section 302 of the IPC. The State has not filed any appeal for
enhancement of the sentence of the appellant. It is further pertinent
to note that during the pendency of this appeal no steps have been
taken to rectify the above position. This Court is therefore left with
no alternative but to decide this appeal being an appeal against
conviction and sentence for the offence under Section 304B of the
16.           Dr. Mangesh Bele (PW9) had conducted post mortem of
the body of deceased Shefali. He found following injuries on the
person of deceased Shefali:
(ii) depressed contusion over right lateral side of neck of size
4 x 0.5 x 0.5 cm reddish in colour,
(iii) depressed contusion over right lateral side of neck of size 1
cm below injury no.2.”
17.           The viscera was preserved for chemical analysis (CA). The
opinion as to the cause of death was reserved. Postmortem report is
at Exh.71. The postmortem was conducted on 29.05.2016 at about
05:00 pm. According to PW9, the approximate time of death of the
deceased was between 24 to 36 hours prior to postmortem. The
uterus was gravid (6 to 8 weeks pregnant). The medical officer
(PW9) issued query report, which is at Exh.73.                 PW9 has
categorically stated in the query report that the death in question
was not due to drowning. All the injuries were antemortem in
nature. In my view, this opinion would assume great importance. As
stated above, the final opinion as to the cause of the death was not
called till the examination of all the witnesses. On 04.11.2019, that
request was made to the Medical Officer to give final opinion with
regard to the cause of death of deceased Shefali. Dr. Mangesh Bele,
Dr. Arvind Alam and Dr. Shambharkar (maiden name Vaidhya) on
going through the CA report, postmortem notes and query report,
gave final opinion as to the cause of death. According to PW9, the
cause of death was strangulation with postmortem drowning. On
the basis of this evidence, the learned Sessions Judge has recorded a
finding that deceased Shefali died unnatural homicidal death due to
bodily injuries and otherwise than under natural circumstance. The
observation of the learned Judge that deceased Shefali died
unnatural homicidal death due to bodily injuries seems to be
misconceived. On the basis of evidence on record, the finding ought
to have been that deceased Shefali died homicidal death due to
strangulation with postmortem drowning. Homicidal death cannot
be termed as unnatural homicide. The homicide means killing of a
man by a man. Section 299 of the IPC defines culpable homicide.
Therefore, there cannot be unnatural homicidal death. It seems that
this finding as to the nature of death has been recorded to bring the
case within the ambit of Section 304B of the IPC. The learned
Judge ought to have recorded finding with regard to the nature of
death based on the oral evidence of PW9 and the postmortem
report, as well as the final opinion of cause of death. The deceased
had sustained three injuries to her neck. The injuries clearly
indicated that deceased was strangulated, killed and thereafter
thrown in the pond. Injuries were antemortem. It therefore goes
without saying that in this case the death was pure and simple
homicidal death.
18.          PW9 was cross-examined on behalf of the accused
persons. Perusal of his cross-examination would show that not a
single admission has been elicited in his cross-examination to
discard the evidence of PW9 and postmortem report. Injuries found
on the dead body and condition of internal organs of the dead body
recorded in postmortem report clearly indicate that death was not
due to drowning. I have already mentioned that essential ingredients
of Section 304B (dowry death) and Section 302 (murder) are totally
different. It is therefore apparent that the charge in this case under
Section 304B of the IPC could not have been substitute for a charge
of murder punishable under Section 302. In the facts and
circumstances, therefore, the cause of death coupled with the
evidence of medical officer is sufficient to record a concrete finding
that deceased Shefali died homicidal death due to strangulation with
postmortem drowning. In view of legal position discussed above and
the fact that death was homicidal, in the facts and circumstances of
this case, the Court can proceed to decide the case of prosecution on
merits for the offence under Section 304B of the IPC. In order to
make out offence under Section 304B the basic requirements are; (i)
demand of dowry and (ii) ill-treatment and harassment by her
husband or any relative in connection with demand of dowry. At
this stage, needless to state that due to the misconception as
mentioned above the appellant and remaining accused were not
made to face principal charge for the offence of murder. It is
apparent on the face of record that on account of this misconception
there is no whisper in the entire judgment about the charge under
Section 302 of the IPC.
19.          Be that as it may, it would be necessary to appreciate the
evidence on record. PW1 is the father of deceased Shefali and PW3
is the mother of deceased Shefali. Evidence of PW1 is not a direct
evidence on the point of the demand of dowry and harassment on
account of failure to pay the dowry. In absence of evidence of PW3
mother of deceased Shefali, evidence of PW1 could have been
termed as hearsay evidence. As per the case of the prosecution, PW3
came to know about the demand of money by the appellant and
remaining accused and due to the failure to meet the demand, the
deceased was subjected to ill-treatment and harassment. PW3 had
conveyed ill-treatment and demand of the money received by her
from deceased Shefali to PW1. Before appreciating their evidence, it
is necessary to state that initially there were five accused, in the case.
The mother of the appellant died during pendency of the trial. The
main allegation against the accused persons as can be seen from the
report at Exh.45 and the evidence of PW1 was that all the accused
insisted deceased Shefali to bring five to six lakh rupees as dowry
from her parents and on that count she was subjected to mental and
physical torture by all the accused. The learned Judge as can be seen
from his judgment observed that no direct role has been attributed
against the accused nos.2,3 and 5. It is observed that against them
there are general allegations of harassment and ill-treatment. In my
view, this observation is not factually correct. The identical role has
been attributed to all the accused in the matter of five to six lakh
rupees and ill-treatment and harassment on that count. In my view,
learned Judge on the basis of the same evidence extended benefit to
the accused nos.2,3 and 5 and acquitted them. In my view, this is
very important aspect which would be required to be borne in mind
while appreciating the evidence of prosecution witnesses.
20.          Before I appreciate the evidence of witnesses, it is
necessary to state that deceased Shefali was beloved and pampered
daughter of PW1. This fact has been admitted in evidence by PW1.
Deceased Shefali had love affair with the appellant.           Deceased
Shefali eloped with appellant and secretly performed the marriage
with him. It has come on record in the evidence of PW1 that
because of this, they had grudge against the appellant and his family
members. It is pertinent to note that this marriage was performed on
05.01.2016 and Shefali died on 28 or 29.05.2016. It has come on
record that in their evidence when they came to know that deceased
Shefali married with the appellant behind the back, the family of the
PW1 severed all ties with deceased Shefali. This aspect could be
very important while appreciating the evidence of PW1 and PW3.
PW3 has stated that after 4 to 5 months of the marriage, deceased
Shefali made a phone call to her and informed her that the appellant
and his family members were asking her to bring five to six lakh
rupees from her parents for construction of upper-floor of the
house. PW3 has stated that the appellant and remaining accused
told deceased Shefali that if her parents had performed her marriage,
they would have spent five to six lakh rupees for marriage and
therefore the amount which has been saved should be given to the
accused persons. In the evidence it is stated that on 27.05.2016
PW3 called deceased Shefali to the house of her neighbor PW5-
Lalita Sonpipre. The deceased came there. She has stated that
deceased started weeping. The deceased told her that she was being
harassed for non-payment of five to six lakh rupees demanded by
the accused persons. So this is the only evidence with regard to
demand of money. She has stated that when deceased Shefali
requested her to the pay the amount, PW3 told her that since she
has married without their consent therefore they could not pay
money to her. PW3 was cross-examined. In her cross-examination,
sufficient material has been elicited to create doubt about the case of
prosecution vis-a-vis demand of money and ill-treatment on that
count. Perusal of her cross-examination would show that the
material statements in examination-in-chief have been proved to be
omission from her statement. It is seen that while recording her
statement by the police PW3 has stated that in April 2016 deceased
Shefali made a phone call to her and demanded five to six lakh
rupees for construction of upper floor of the house. Deceased
Shefali told to PW3 that if they had performed her marriage they
would have spent five to six lakh rupees. This shows that deceased
on her own demanded money. It therefore clearly indicates that
PW3 has improved her statement before the Court and stated that
deceased Shefali made this demand at the instance of the accused
persons. It is seen that first part of the story narrated by PW3 has
been found to be self-contradictory to her initial statement. It is
therefore not possible to place explicit reliance on the story narrated
by the PW3. The material improvement made by PW3 has made
evidence of PW3 doubtful.
21.          In this context, it would be necessary to consider the
events occurred on 27.05.2016 when PW1 and deceased Shefali met
at the house of neighbor Lalita Sonpipre, who has been examined as
PW5. PW3 has stated that on the pretext of attending the birthday
of son of Laita Sonpipre deceased Shefali come to her house. PW3
went there when she received call from Sonpipre. She has stated that
there deceased Shefali started weeping and told her that she is being
harassed and ill-treated on account of failure to bring five to six lakh
rupees from her parents by all accused. This solitary statement has
been made the basis of the conviction of the appellant. Perusal of
the evidence of PW3 would clearly indicate that she has attributed a
specific role to all the accused persons with equal vehemence. It is to
be noted that when this evidence is found to be of general and
vague in nature against accused nos.2,3 and 5, I fail to understand
how the same evidence could diminish its general and vague
character against the appellant. In my view, the finding of the
learned Judge is self-contradictory. It cannot be sustained. On the
contrary, perusal of the evidence of PW3 would show that she had
attributed serious role to accused no.5-Pallavi, the sister-in-law of
deceased Shefali. It has come on record in evidence that after love
marriage, the appellant and deceased Shefali were staying at the
house of Pallavi. Pallavi is married to accused no.3. The appellant
and deceased Shefali, as can be seen from the evidence on record,
were provided shelter by accused no.5-Pallavi and therefore she was
in a dominant position. In the facts and circumstances, in my view,
the allegations are general and vague against the appellant as well
and therefore the learned Judge ought to have extended the benefit
to the appellant which he has extended to accused nos.2,3 and 5.
22.          Evidence of PW1 is on the line of the evidence of PW3.
PW1 has stated that in the evening of 27.05.2016 PW3 had told
him about her meeting with deceased Shefali, the demand of five to
six lakh rupees and ill-treatment and harassment to her on that
count. PW1 has stated that deceased Shefali had made a phone call
to PW3 and told her that accused persons were making demand of
five to six lakh rupees, which they had saved due to her love
marriage. The statement made by PW3 on this count specifically
attributing the role to the accused persons in making demand of
money, has been proved to be an omission. In his evidence, he has
narrated the incident occurred at the house of PW5-Lalita Sonpipre.
It is seen that after this incident, PW1 neither took any action nor
contacted deceased Shefali. In the context of the chronology of
events, the case putforth with regard to the demand of money by the
appellant and the family members appears to be improbable. There
are material omissions and inconsistencies in the evidence of PW1
and PW3. Their evidence is self-contradictory. Their evidence
creates doubt about occurrence of incident as stated.
23.          It would be necessary to consider the evidence of the
independent witnesses. PW5-Lalita Sonpipre’s evidence would be
very relevant because so called meeting of the PW3 and deceased
Shefali took place at her house. It is the case of PW3 that when
deceased Shefali narrated the incident to her, PW5 was present
there. Perusal of evidence of PW5 does not support this fact. PW5
has stated that in her presence deceased Shefali told her mother that
accused treated her well for few days and now they are harassing her
for bringing the money. She has stated that her mother(PW3) told
deceased Shefali that since she had performed love marriage they
would not pay money to her. Her evidence is silent about weeping
of deceased Shefali at her house. Her evidence is also silent about
demand of particular sum of money and beating for dowry. In her
cross-examination, PW5 has stated that when she made enquiry
with deceased Shefali about her family life, she told her that they
were doing well. She has stated that when PW3 told deceased that if
she had performed marriage with their consent, they would have
performed her marriage well, the deceased became speechless and
started weeping. She has further stated that about the family life of
deceased, deceased Shefali told her that mother-in-law, sister-in-law
and husband are residing together. Deceased Shefali also told that
they are residing happily. PW5 has stated when this talk was going
on her neighbor Jambhule Tai came there. Perusal of evidence of
PW5 would show that on material aspect she has not corroborated
the version of PW3. It is to be noted that the main episode took
placed at the house of PW5 in her presence. In this backdrop, PW5
could be the proper witness to narrate all the facts narrated by PW3,
if incident as stated had occurred in her house. PW5 has admitted in
her cross-examination that her neighbor Jambhule Tai had also
made enquiry with deceased Shefali. The deceased told Jambhule
Tai that she was doing well. In my view, therefore, evidence of PW5
instead of supporting the case of prosecution creates the path
difficult for the prosecution. The combine reading of evidence of
PW1, PW3 and PW5 would show that their evidence is not
sufficient with regard to the demand of money as a dowry, ill-
treatment and harassment on that count. PW1 and PW3 have
categorically admitted that due to the marriage by the deceased
Shefali with the appellant they had grudge against the appellant and
his family members. It is to be noted that if the demand of dowry
and ill-treatment on that count was narrated by the deceased, then
PW1 without wasting time could have lodged the report. In my
view, this would reflect on their conduct. Their conduct in the facts
situation, appears to be contrary to the conduct of man of prudence
placed in a similarly situation.
24.          The prosecution has examined three important witnesses
to seek corroboration to the case of prosecution. PW6 is one of
those witnesses. He has deposed that on 28.05.2016 when he was
sleeping in his courtyard, at about 2 to 2:30 am he woke-up for
urination and at that time, he saw two vehicles coming towards his
house from filter by-pass road. He has stated that Vijay Barapatre
was on one motor bike and accused Mangesh Kannake was driving
another motor bike and Pallavi was holding Shefali on that motor
bike. He thought that they were taking Shefali to hospital. He has
stated that after half an hour they returned from the same road but
Shefali was not seen with them. This witness seems to have been
examined to prove that in the night intervening of 27 and
28.05.2016 at 02.00 to 02.30 a.m. deceased Shefali was carried by
those accused and thrown in pond. It is pertinent to note that this
witness was under the thumb of the police. Several crimes registered
against him at the same police station. It is further pertinent to note
that his evidence is directly contradictory to the evidence of PW7
and PW8. PW7 has stated he saw Shefali on 28.05.2016 in front of
his house. It means that during the day time of 28.05.2016, he saw
deceased Shefali. He has stated that deceased Shefali was going to
her house carrying bread packet. PW8 has stated that on
28.05.2016 he saw deceased Shefali and the appellant going towards
market on motorcycle. Therefore, evidence of PW6 is contradictory
to the evidence of PW7 and PW8. If deceased Shefali was killed or
carried on the motorcycle as stated by the PW6 on 28.05.2016 at
about 02.00 to 02:30 am then there was no question of PW7 and
PW8 having seen deceased Shefali alive during day time of
28.05.2016. PW6 seems to be a got-up witness. Their evidence is
not the direct evidence on the point of ill-treatment and demand of
money.
25.          There is one more circumstance which goes against the
case of the prosecution. PW12 has stated that CDR and SDR of the
phone carried by deceased Shefali was obtained. He has
categorically stated that the last location of deceased Shefali, as per
CDR, was near the bus stand. It is the case of the appellant that this
CDR has been suppressed despite making repeated requests for
production of the same by the prosecution. Perusal of the record
would show that the accused had made an application seeking
direction to the prosecution to produce the CDR and SDR. The
learned Sessions Judge rejected the said application. It has come on
record that house of the PW1, father of deceased Shefali is in the
vicinity of the bus stand. PW12 has admitted that after obtaining
the CDR and SDR of the mobile, it was handed over to PSI
Lasanthe. In my view, this aspect would assume importance in view
of the categorical admission by PW1 and PW3 that they had grudge
against the appellant and his family members. They have stated that
their reputation was spoiled due to the marriage performed by
deceased Shefali with the appellant. In my opinion, therefore, failure
to produce CDR and SDR despite repeated requests by the accused
is one more circumstance to create doubt about the prosecution case
against the appellant. No plausible explanation has been placed on
record for such non-production.
26.          On minute perusal and appreciation of evidence, I am of
the opinion that the prosecution has failed to prove the charge
under Section 304B particularly with regard to the demand of any
amount as dowry and ill-treatment on that count. In the facts and
circumstances, therefore, merely because of the evidence of the
doctor as to the cause of death the appellant cannot be held guilty of
the offence punishable under Section 304B of the IPC.
27.          It is to be noted that the learned Sessions Judge has not
properly considered the case of the prosecution vis-a-vis charge of
the murder under Section 302 is concern. It is seen that in the entire
judgment there is no even cursory observation about the charge of
murder of deceased Shefali and the evidence adduced by the
prosecution. In the teeth of the specific opinion as to the cause of
death i.e. strangulation with postmortem drowning, the learned
Judge ought to have amended and made charge under Section 302
as a principal charge against appellant and other accused. In that
event circumstances relevant to the point of homicidal death
brought on record would have been of some assistance to the case of
prosecution. In this case, therefore the basic two ingredients of
section 304B have not been made out namely; demand of dowry
and the ill-treatment or harassment on that count. Therefore, in my
view, the judgment and order passed by the learned Judge cannot be
sustained. The appellant would be entitled to get benefit which has
been extended to the accused nos.2,3 and 5 by the learned Sessions
Judge. The appeal deserves to be allowed. Hence, following order:
(i)    The criminal appeal is allowed.
(ii)   The judgment and order of conviction and sentence
passed by the Sessions Judge, Gadchiroli dated 01.04.2021
passed in Sessions Case No.87/2016 is set aside.
(iii)  Appellant – Mangesh s/o Deorao Kannake (accused
no.1) is acquitted of the offence under Section 304B of the
(iv)   The appellant be set at liberty forthwith, if not required
in any other crime. Fine amount, if any, deposited by the
appellant be refunded to him.
