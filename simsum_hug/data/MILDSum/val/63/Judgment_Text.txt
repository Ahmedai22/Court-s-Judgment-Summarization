Heard learned counsel for the petitioner as well as learned A.G.A. for the State-
The present petition has been filed seeking direction to the respondent
authorities to conclude the fair investigation of Case Crime No. 610 of 2021,
Contention of learned counsel for the petitioner is that the police is acting in
collusion with the accused persons and as yet neither the accused persons have
been arrested nor any charge sheet has been filed against the accused persons.
Admittedly, petitioner is aggrieved by the manner of investigation said to have
been conducted against private respondents.
The Apex Court in the case of Sudhir Bhaskarrao Tambe Vs. Hemant
Yashwant Dhage, (2016) 6 SCC 277, following its earlier decision in Sakiri
"2. This Court has held in Sakiri Vasu v. State of U.P., that if a person has a grievance that his FIR
has not been registered by the police, or having been registered, proper investigation is not being
done, then the remedy of the aggrieved person is not to go to the High Court under Article 226 of
the Constitution of India, but to approach the Magistrate concerned under Section 156(3) Cr.P.C.
If such an application under Section 156(3) CrPC is made and the Magistrate is, prima facie,
satisfied, he can direct the FIR to be registered, or if it has already been registered, he can direct
proper investigation to be done which includes in his discretion, if he deems it necessary,
recommending change of the investigating officer, so that a proper investigation is done in the
matter. We have said this in Sakiri Vasu case because what we have found in this country is that
the High Courts have been flooded with writ petitions praying for registration of the first
information report or praying for a proper investigation.
3. We are of the opinion that if the High Courts entertain such writ petitions, then they will be
flooded with such writ petitions and will not be able to do any other work except dealing with such
writ petitions. Hence, we have held that the complainant must avail of his alternate remedy to
approach the Magistrate concerned under Section 156(3) Cr.P.C. and if he does so, the Magistrate
will ensure, if prima facie he is satisfied, registration of the first information report and also
ensure a proper investigation in the matter, and he can also monitor the investigation."
The power of the Magistrate to monitor investigation in exercise of his power
under section 156(3) Cr.P.C. has also been recognized in the decision of the
Apex Court in the case of T.C. Thangaraj vs. V. Engammal, (2011) 12 SCC
328 : (2012) 1 SCC (Cri) 568, where, in the light of the law laid down in Sakiri
"12. It should also be noted that Section 156 (3) of the Code of Criminal Procedure provides for a
check by the Magistrate on the police performing their duties and where the Magistrate finds that
the police have not done their duty or not investigated satisfactorily, he can direct the police to
carry out the investigation properly, and can monitor the same. (See Sakiri Vasu v. State of U.P.)."
Recently, the Hon'ble Supreme Court in M.Subramaniam and another Vs.
S.Janaki and another, 2020 SCC online S.C. 341 affirmed the view taken by
the Supreme Court in Sakiri Vasu Vs. State of Uttar Pradesh (supra) and held as
"17. In our opinion Section 156 (3) Cr.P.C. is wide enough to include all such powers in a
Magistrate which are necessary for ensuring a proper investigation, and it includes the power to
order registration of an FIR and of ordering a proper investigation if the Magistrate is satisfied
that a proper investigation has not been done, or is not being done by the police. Section 156 (3)
Cr.P.C., though briefly worded, in our opinion, is very wide and it will include all such incidental
powers as are necessary for ensuring a proper investigation."
In view of the law noticed above, we dispose off this petition with liberty to the
petitioner to invoke the power of the Magistrate available under the Code of
Criminal Procedure in the light of the law laid down by the Apex Court as
noticed above.
