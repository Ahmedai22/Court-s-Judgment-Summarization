Present: - Ms.Jyoti Sareen, Advocate, for the petitioner.
Mr.ADS Sukhija, Advocate, for the respondents.
The petitioner is the proprietor of a proprietary concern by
name, M/s New Bajaj Electronics, dealing in the business of electronic
His brother was the proprietor of another proprietary concern by
These two concerns availed loan from the respondents-DCB
Bank against property to the tune of `67 lakh in 2013. The loan against
property was later enhanced to `95 lakh in September, 2015, repayable over
a period of 15 years in equal monthly installments of `1.14 lakhs each. The
petitioner, in his personal capacity, also stood a guarantor to the credit
facility availed by the firms by mortgaging his property in favour of the
When the EMIs of the loans were not paid, the respondents
declared the loan accounts as NPA on 01.12.2018 and issued notice
dt. 06.12.2018 (P1) under Section 13(2) of the Securitization &
Reconstruction of Financial Assets & Enforcement of Security Interest Act,
2002 [for short ‘the SARFAESI Act’].
Petitioner and his brother submitted an OTS proposal alongwith
a demand draft of `10 lakh on 22.08.2019 (P2) to the respondents with a
condition to encash the same subject to acceptance of the settlement
proposal. The respondents however encashed the said demand draft but did
not accept the settlement proposal.
The Second OTS dt.18.06.2020 and its refusal
Petitioner and his brother again made a joint settlement
proposal on 18.06.2020 (P3) offering `75.32 lakh to the respondents but, the
same was not accepted.
Revised Settlement proposal dt. 16.7.2020 and its acceptance
Petitioner then submitted a revised settlement proposal on
16.07.2020 (P4) offering `85 lakh.
On 25.07.2020, the respondents-Bank accepted the settlement
proposal submitted by the petitioner for `85 lakh and issued a OTS sanction
letter dt.25.07.2020 (P5).
According to the said sanction letter, `25 lakh is payable by
31.07.2020, `20 lakh by 30.08.2020 and `40 lakh by 30.09.2020.
Petitioner by 30.09.2020 paid a sum of `49 lakh as against the
total settlement amount of `85 lakh and was unable to raise the balance
amount of `36 lakh by the last date of payment i.e. 30.09.2020.
Request of petitioner for extension of time to pay amount as the OTS
sanctioned and its refusal
On 30.09.2020, petitioner requested the respondents-Bank to
grant extension of 90 days time for making payment of the balance amount
of `36 lakh. He stated that delay had occurred in making this payment as the
purchaser to whom the petitioner had sold the property did not make
payment of `40 lakh in time (which was to be paid by the said purchaser by
28.09.2020). It was also mentioned that due to Covid-19, there was slow
down in business because of which the purchaser of the property could not
raise the funds to make full payment to the petitioner by the last date and
thus, the petitioner was constrained to seek extension.
When there was no response from the respondents-Bank,
petitioner represented on 31.12.2020 seeking time to make payment of `36
lakh with interest for the delayed payment.
According to the petitioner, the official of respondent
No.2-Bank refused to receive the letter/representation dt. 31.12.2020 (P7)
and so he sent the same by registered post.
Petitioner therefore, filed the instant Writ Petition for a
direction to the respondents to accept the balance amount of `36 lakh out of
the total settlement amount of `85 lakh along with interest at 9% p.a. w.e.f.
01.10.2020 to 31.12.2020.
Contention of the counsel for the petitioner
Counsel for the petitioner contends that the letter dt.31.12.2020
(P7) was received by the respondents on 02.01.2021 and the petitioner filed
the instant Writ Petition on 24.02.2021, and thereafter, deposited the sum of
`36 lakh in the Punjab and Sindh Bank by way of a Fixed Deposit on
Counsel for the petitioner contends that since the petitioner had
made a substantial payment towards OTS of `49 lakh in the time period
granted in the OTS sanctioned letter dt. 25.07.2020 (P5) by 30.09.2020, and
due to unavoidable circumstances, the petitioner could not pay the balance of
`36 lakh before 30.9.2020, the respondents should be directed to extend the
time for the OTS and accept the amount of `36 lakh offered by the petitioner
with interest for such delayed payment.
Counsel for the petitioner places reliance on the judgment of the
Division Bench of this Court in Anu Bhalla and another Vs. District
Magistrate, Pathankot1 and also a decision in Aseem Gaind Vs. Axis Bank,
Counsel also contended that the OTS policy of the
respondents-Bank was issued pursuant to the circular issued by the Reserve
Bank of India on 04.10.2007 and 21.06.2010; that the said OTS policy was
framed on 12.01.2016 and even thereafter was reviewed by the Board of
Directors of the respondents-Bank on 01.06.2017; and it also contained
Clause 6.9 which contemplated even delayed payment of OTS by extending
timelines subject to approval by the sanctioning authority. He contended
that the Writ Petition may, therefore, be allowed as prayed for.
Events after filing of the Writ Petition
Notice of motion was issued on 26.02.2021 for 22.07.2021 and
reply was filed on behalf of the respondents on 22.11.2021. Rejoinder was
filed on 21.12.2021. Thereafter, the matter was heard on 28.03.2022 and
order was reserved.
The respondents contended that the Writ Petition was not
maintainable since the petitioner had not exhausted alternative remedy
available under law.
According to the respondents, only one OTS proposal
dt.22.08.2019 was received by them.
They however admit that they had adjusted the sum of `10
lakhs paid by the petitioner along with the said OTS proposal.
As regards the OTS sanctioned on 25.07.2020, it is contended
that the petitioner was not able to fulfill obligation as per the said OTS, that
it lapsed after 30.09.2020, and is no longer valid. It is contended that the
petitioner was informed that the Bank will no longer receive `36 lakh on
account of non-fulfillment of terms of the OTS.
Stand taken by the petitioner in rejoinder
Rejoinder was filed by the petitioner contending that no
alternative remedy is available to the petitioner under law for the relief
sought in the Writ Petition and a Writ is maintainable for seeking extension
of time to make balance amount under the OTS, which relief is sought by
him in the Writ Petition.
He contended that after the sanction of OTS, when `49 lakh
was paid by the petitioner, the respondents ought to have taken into account
the said payments and calculated interest on reducing balance, but instead
pressed the ECS against the amount deposited by the petitioner and acted
It is contended that the respondents inflated the amount payable
by charging late payment interest arbitrarily.
He reiterated the contentions raised in the Writ Petition and
stated that he had represented to respondent No.2 on 24.03.2021 enclosing
copy of the FDR along with the cheque dt. 04.3.2021 with an offer to make
payment of the balance amount of OTS with interest but, the respondents
returned the cheque for `36 lakh in May 2021 and acted arbitrarily.
Consideration by the Court
The instant Writ Petition is maintainable
As far as the maintainability of the Writ Petition is concerned, it
is not in dispute that the respondents- DCB Bank is a Scheduled Bank
mentioned in the Schedule of the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934 and is
governed by the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 [for short ‘the Banking
Admittedly, the OTS policy framed by the respondents was
pursuant to certain circulars issued by the Reserve Bank of India.
Clause 6.1 of the OTS Policy of respondents placed before this
Court states as under: -
The      Reserve     Bank     of     India    vide    Circular     DBOD
No.BP.BC.34/21.04.048/2007-08 dt. October 4, 2007 directed the banks to
lay down policies and guidelines covering among other things valuation
procedure to be followed to ensure that the economic value of financial
asset is reasonably estimated bases on the assessed cash flows arising out
of repayments and recovery prospects. Also, RBI vide circular BP.BC.
NO.112/21.04..048/2009-10 dt. June 21, 2010 required the sanctioning
authority to append a certificate on compromise settlement conforming to
the regulatory guidelines. To comply with the regulatory guidelines, the
Bank has put in place Board approved One Time Settlement Policy on 12th
January 2016 which was reviewed by Board of Directors on 1st June
It is not in dispute that the Reserve Bank of India is a statutory
authority and exercises supervisory power in the matter of functioning of
Scheduled Banks. It supervises the Scheduled Banks and is empowered to
issue guidelines from time to time under Section 21 of the Banking
Regulation Act, 1949 [for short ‘the 1949 Act’].
The guidelines issued by the Reserve Bank of India are binding
on all Scheduled Banks as per the decision of the Supreme Court in Central
Bank of India Vs. Ravindra3.
In Sardar Associates and others Vs. Punjab and Sind Bank
and others4, the Supreme Court held, following the above decision, that the
Reserve Bank of India, in exercise of the power conferred on it under
Section 21 of the 1949 Act, can formulate policies which banking companies
are bound to follow; and Sub Section (3) of Section 21 of the 1949 Act
mandates that every banking company shall be bound to comply with the
directions given to it in terms thereof. It also noted that Section 35-A of the
1949 Act empowers the Reserve Bank of India to issue directions inter alia
in the interest of banking policy. It held that pursuant to the guidelines issued
by the Reserve Bank of India, an OTS Scheme is framed by a Bank and so
the said Bank cannot violate the terms of the said Scheme but must act
according to the guidelines framed by the Reserve Bank of India.                It
declared that if in terms of guidelines issued by the Reserve Bank of India, a
right is created in a borrower, a Writ of Mandamus can also be issued since
the guidelines of the Reserve Bank of India have statutory flavor as held in
the Central Bank of India case ( 3 Supra).
In fact a Division Bench of this Court in Anu Bhalla (1 Supra),
specifically held that in exercise of jurisdiction under Article 226 of the
Constitution of India, High Courts would have the jurisdiction to extend the
period of settlement as originally provided for in the OTS letter subject to
certain guidelines laid down in the said judgment.
It held that One Time Settlement is not cloaked with rigorous
principles which may not permit extension of period to pay the
remaining/balance settlement amount; and in fact OTS policies of certain
Banks themselves contain provisions for extension for the time period in
their respective settlement Policies.
Once this is so, the Bench held that there is no reason to hold
that the Courts, in exercise of their equitable jurisdiction under Article 226
of the Constitution of India, cannot extend such time period of settlement.
It held that the willful defaulters and fraudsters would not be
entitled to such extension, and in the case of a deserving borrower, who has
deposited substantial amount within the original stipulated period of
settlement, and proved his bona fides, and is willing to clear the remaining
amount in a reasonable period and also compensate the creditor with interest
for the period of delay, the Court can consider extending the period with
some flexibility to achieve the ultimate aim of such settlement.
It laid down certain illustrative guidelines which are required to
be considered cumulatively or individually on case to case basis to decide
whether in a given case an applicant would be entitled for the extension of
A.     The original time provided in the Settlement:-
If the time period originally stipulated in the settlement letter to
pay off the settlement amount is short or is not excessive, the
case for extension could be considered, and reasonable time
must be given to the borrower to arrange the funds to clear off
the OTS.
B.     Extent of payments already deposited under the settlement
or before filing of the petition:-
If the borrower has already paid substantial amounts to the
creditor under the OTS, and for some remaining amounts, is
seeking a reasonable extension, such request can be considered
favourably.
If the borrower was prevented by certain reasons or
circumstances beyond his control, it could be a reason to
consider an extension favourably. It would be imperative for the
borrower to show, that he made his best efforts to ensure that
the requisite amounts are arranged within the specified time, but
in spite of all his best efforts, he could not arrange for the same.
D.   Payments having been accepted by the Bank/Financial
Institution, after the stipulated date:-
If some payments were accepted by the Bank even after the
stipulated period of time, it would show that the time was not
the essence of contract, and it would be apparent from such
conduct, that certain amount of relaxation or flexibility in
making the payment of OTS amount is reserved between the
parties.
E.   Bona fide Intent of the borrower to pay the remaining
amounts under the settlement –
The bonafide intention of such an applicant could reasonably
be tested by asking such an applicant to deposit some further
amount, towards the balance amount before calling upon the
bank to consider the issue of extension. If such amounts are
deposited under the orders of Court and the bonafides are
established, such an applicant would be entitled for a favourable
consideration of an application for extension.
F.   Time period being demanded by the applicant to clear the
remaining / balance settlement amount.
An applicant whose intention would be to clear the balance
settlement amounts, would not claim an unreasonable period of
time extension, as otherwise, the intention would be to gain
more time, without any actual intent to clear the settlement. In
the facts and circumstances of each case, the Courts would
therefore determine a reasonable period, to enable the borrower
to clear the remaining settlement amount, subject of course, to
payment of reasonable interest for the delayed period, to
balance the equities.
Illustrations of such factors could be the situation created by
COVID-19 pandemic, and the difficulties in arranging the
amounts could be taken note of while determining the period of
extension to be granted to an applicant. Likewise, losses
suffered on account of natural calamities, unfortunate accidents,
fire incidents, thefts, damage by floods, storms etc. could also
be the factors to be taken into account for extension of time.
H.    Irreparable loss and injury to the applicant
The Division Bench in Anu Bhalla (1 Supra) clarified that the
guidelines/factors are not exhaustive but only illustrative for the
guidance of the parties and the Courts, while considering the
prayer by the borrower for extension of the time under OTS on
case to case basis. It also held that the Courts would be free to
consider the credentials of the borrower as well, being an
equitable and discretionary relief.
Several decisions rendered by different High Courts and
Supreme Court were considered by the said Division Bench while rendering
the above judgment in Anu Bhalla ( 1 supra).
Therefore, the contention of the respondent-Bank that in no
circumstance can the Court grant extension of time for completion of the
payment under the OTS, cannot be countenanced. Such a power undoubtedly
exists, though not as a matter of right, and must be exercised by a High
Court keeping in mind the above guidelines/principles.
In the instant case, not only was the OTS policy framed by the
respondents-Bank but, there was a sanction also accorded for the OTS vide
Annexure P5 dt.25.7.2020 to the petitioner by the said Bank.
In the OTS Policy framed by the respondents-Bank, Clause 6.9
“In case of all compromise proposals sanctioned by the Bank, there would
be some sacrifice of Interest and/or principal. Hence it is of paramount
importance that the Bank needs to recover the agreed amount as per
compromise arrangement in accordance with the agreed terms and in
time. If any amount is not paid as per agreed terms, follow-up with the
borrower should be immediately initiated and pursued to recover the
overdue amount as per agreed terms. Collections team should initiate
recovery action and in case default persist for more than 90 days. Any
extension of timelines for payment of agreed amount should be approved
by respective sanctioning authority.    However, if the advance is not
secured and borrower is paying installments with some day, the
settlements could be continued with intimation/ratification of sanctioning
authority.” (emphasis supplied)
A reading of the above Clause itself indicates that in certain
circumstances there could be extension of timelines for payment of agreed
amount payable under the OTS though approval of the respective
sanctioning authority is stated to be required.
Having regard to the terms of the above Clause in the OTS
Policy, it is not open to the respondents-Bank to take a stand as it did in its
reply at Para 11 that once the petitioner was not able to fulfill his obligation
as per the OTS, the OTS lapses and would no longer be valid.
It was duty bound to consider whether the request made by the
petitioner on 30.09.2020 for extension of time to comply with the OTS by 90
days is justified or not. It cannot be blindly rejected.
Since the respondents-Bank has acted contrary to the terms of
its own OTS policy, framed as per the RBI directives, a right is created in the
petitioner which is certainly enforceable by way of a Writ Petition under
Article 226 of the Constitution of India.
So we reject the plea of the respondents that the instant Writ
Petition is not maintainable.
The plea of availability of alternative remedy to petitioner is rejected
The plea of alternate remedy raised by the respondents,
probably referring to the remedy available under Section 17 of the
SARFAESI Act, in our considered opinion, is not a tenable plea either.
The Debt Recovery Tribunal constituted under the Recovery of
Debts Due to Banks and Financial Institutions Act, 1993, is the Forum
mentioned in Section 17 of the SARFAESI Act, and is empowered to deal
with applications against the measures to recover secured debts, referred in
Sub Section (4) of Section 13 of the SARFAESI Act, taken by the Secured
Creditor, and under Sub Section (2) of Section 17 of the SARFAESI Act is
empowered to consider whether any such measure taken by the secured
creditor for enforcement of security are in accordance with the provisions of
this Act and the rules made thereunder.
In cases, like the instant one, where such measures have not
been initiated yet, the remedy under Section 17(1) of the SARFAESI Act
cannot be availed prima facie. Also where extension of time for OTS is to be
granted or not is not an issue normally within the purview of the DRT
having regard to the language contained in Sec.17 of the SARFAESI Act.
The decision in Phoenix ARC Private Limited is inapplicable.
Reliance placed by the counsel for the petitioner on the
Supreme Court judgment in Phoenix ARC Private Limited Vs. Vishwa
Bharati Vidya Mandir & Ors5 is of no avail because firstly the
respondents-Bank is not an Asset Reconstruction Company unlike the
appellant in the said case. Secondly, in that case a writ petition had been
moved in the High Court by the respondent in the said civil appeal against
the appellant Assets Reconstruction Company, complaining of action
initiated under Section 13(4) of the SARFAESI Act and in that context, on
the facts of the said case, the Supreme Court expressed a view that the Writ
Petition under Article 226 of the Constitution of India is not maintainable
when there is an effective alternate remedy available unless the case of the
petitioner falls within the exceptions carved out in Whirlpool Corpn. Vs.
Registrar of Trade Marks6 and other judgments mentioned therein.
The Court held that when the appellant in that case gave a
notice to the respondent-borrower to make payment within two weeks failing
which a further proceeding under Section 13(4) of the SARFAESI Act was
proposed - against such a proposed action, the Writ Petition is not
maintainable or entertainable.
There is also an observation that a Writ Petition against the
private financial institution such as Asset Reconstruction Company under
Article 226 of the Constitution of India against the proposed action/actions
under Section 13(4) of the SARFAESI Act can be said to be not
maintainable and that the said Asset Reconstruction Company was not
performing public functions which are normally expected to be performed
by the State authorities.
The attention of the Supreme Court does not appear to have
been drawn to the fact that the Asset Reconstruction Companies owe their
origin to Section 3 of the SARFAESI Act and their registration is done by
the Reserve Bank of India, and such registration can be cancelled by the
Reserve Bank of India under Section 4 of the SARFAESI Act. Under
Section 5 of the SARFAESI Act they are permitted to acquire financial
assets of any Bank or Financial Institution. Under Section 9 of the
SARFAESI Act, the Asset Reconstruction Company is empowered to adopt
certain measures for asset reconstruction, and under Sub Section (2) of
Section 9 of the SARFAESI Act, the Reserve Bank is empowered to
determine the policy and issue necessary directions including the direction
for regulation of management of the business of the borrower and fees to be
charged. Reserve Bank of India is given power to supervise over the Asset
Reconstruction Companies under Section 12A and 12B of the SARFAESI
A learned Single Judge of the Andhra Pradesh High Court in
Ltd.7 Held, after considering all the provisions of the SARFAESI Act, that a
Writ Petition under Article 226 of the Constitution of India is maintainable
against an Asset Reconstruction Company. The said decision was also
confirmed by a Division Bench constituted by Justice Anil Ramesh Dave
and Justice R. Subhash Reddy in Writ Appeal No. 412 of 2008 on
24.09.2009. The decision of the Division Bench was also confirmed as
SLP(C) No. 012697 of 2010 filed against the said judgment was dismissed
For the aforesaid reasons, we hold that the decision is Phoenix
ARC Private Limited (5 Supra) cannot be of any assistance to the
“Whether in the facts and circumstances of the case, the
petitioner is entitled to grant of extension of time for
complying with the OTS sanctioned on 25.07.2020 and if so,
Admittedly vide Annexure P-5 dt. 25.07.2020, the
respondents had sanctioned an OTS for a total amount of `85 lakh to the
petitioner as per the OTS Policy framed by them. Under the terms of the
said sanction, petitioner was to pay `25 lakh by 31.07.2020, `20 lakh by
30.08.2020 and `40 lakh by 30.09.2020.
No doubt it contains a clause that in case of default in
compliance with the above payment schedule, the settlement offer shall
stand cancelled and the Bank reserves the right to re-debit petitioner’s
account with all waivers and initiate legal action.
It is not in dispute that by 30.09.2020, petitioner had paid
`45 lakh and the balance payable was `40 lakh.
On 30.09.2020, petitioner made a request for extension of
the OTS by 90 days on account of the Covid-19 Pandemic, slowing
down of economy, slow flow of funds in the market and also on the
ground that the purchaser of the mortgaged property delayed payment of
the said amount to him.
Petitioner admittedly deposited `4 lakh with the said
letter/request dt. 30.09.2020.
So the balance payable after 30.09.2020 was `36 lakh.
Petitioner wrote a letter on 31.12.2020 that the balance
amount of `36 lakh plus interest from 01.10.2020 till that date was
arranged by him, that he did not receive consent to deposit the same to
adjust the account, and he would deposit the said amount within 48 hours
of the respondents’ giving consent.
Petitioner alleges that the incharge officer of the branch of
the respondent No.2 refused to receive the said letter and so the
petitioner sent it by Regd. Post and the same was received on 02.01.2021
by the respondent No.2.
The above facts reveal that the petitioner had deposited a
substantial amount of `49 lakhs out of `85 lakhs sanctioned as OTS by
30.09.2020, the last date for payment fixed under the sanction letter dt.
25.07.2020 and thus proved his bona fide.
The difficulties caused to borrowers on account of the
Covid-19 Pandemic in the year 2020 and 2021, the slowing down of the
economy are matters of common knowledge. The petitioner claims that
the purchaser of mortgaged property from the petitioner delayed
payment of portion of the sale consideration as a consequence of which
petitioner could not pay the same by 30.09.2020 and sought time till
31.12.2020 to pay the balance `36 lakh with interest. We see no reason
to disbelieve the petitioner’s contention.
We are of the opinion that these difficulties faced by the
petitioner cannot be brushed aside lightly and ought to be
sympathetically considered by this Court keeping in mind that only two
months and five days (the time gap between the date of sanction of OTS
on 25.07.2020 and the date of 30.09.2020 which was the last date for
payment of `85 lakh) i.e. a very short time was granted, and only 90
days (till 31.12.2020) was sought for payment of the balance `36 lakh.
The petitioner had arranged the balance `36 lakh with interest by
31.12.2020 and claims to have approached the Bank with the letter to
make the payment of the same, and when the official of the Bank refused
to receive it, he sent it by Regd. Post which was received on 02.01.2021
by the respondent No.2/Bank.
Even thereafter, there was no response from the Bank and
the petitioner had to file the instant Writ Petition on 24.02.2021.
We are satisfied that the material on record in this case
indicates that the case of the petitioner falls within the parameters fixed
in the decision of Anu Bhalla (1 Supra) by this Court, and that in the
interest of justice and equity, the time for payment of the balance OTS
amount ought to be extended, in the facts and circumstances of the case.
We are also of the opinion that the non acceptance of the
amount of `36 lakh with interest offered by the petitioner on
31.12.2020/02.01.2021 by the respondents is arbitrary and illegal and
violative of Article 14 of the Constitution of India particularly when the
OTS policy itself in Clause 6.9 contemplated extension of timelines for
payment of the sanctioned OTS.
Since the pendency of this Writ Petition till date cannot be
to the prejudice of the petitioner, the petitioner is directed to deposit the
sum of `36 lakh plus interest thereon at 9% per annum from 30.09.2020
till 02.01.2021 only within ten days from the date of receipt of a copy of
this order; and the respondents are directed to adjust the same towards
the OTS sanctioned on 25.07.2020 vide Annexure P-5, release the
securities, if any, to the petitioner within two weeks of receipt of the
above payment.
Writ petition is allowed accordingly. No costs.
