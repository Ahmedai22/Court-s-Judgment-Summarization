1.    The appellant (hereafter ‘Welspun’) has filed the present appeal
under Section 37(1)(c) of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996
(hereafter ‘the A&C Act’) impugning an order dated 20.11.2018
(hereafter ‘the impugned order’) passed by the learned Single Judge,
whereby the appellant’s application under Section 34 of the A&C Act,
By:Dushyant Rawal       FAO(OS)(COMM) No.9/2019                               Page 1 of 48
seeking to set aside an arbitral award dated 23.07.2018 (hereafter ‘the
impugned award’), was rejected.
2.     The impugned award was rendered by majority of 2:1 by an
Arbitral Tribunal comprising of three members. Whilst the majority
was of the view that the claims of Welspun, as included in the Final
Bill, were barred by limitation, one of the members of the Arbitral
Tribunal (minority) expressed a contrary view.
3.     The learned Single Judge concurred with the view that the claims,
as contained in the Final Bill, were barred by limitation for the reason
that the arbitration had not commenced within a period of three years
from the due date for payment of the Final Bill, as claimed.
4.     The Arbitration Clause contemplated a pre-arbitration dispute
resolution mechanism by referring the disputes to the Chief Executives
of the parties. The dispute resolution process failed on 21.12.2012 and
the notice for arbitration was issued on 27.01.2014. According to
Welspun, the right to seek reference to arbitration would arise on failure
of the amicable dispute resolution procedure and thus, invocation of the
arbitration was within the period of limitation. However, the learned
Single Judge rejected the said contention, inter alia, on the ground that
Welspun had failed to explain the delay in invoking the arbitration after
the dispute resolution process had failed on 21.12.2012.
5.     The principal controversy to be addressed in the present appeal
is whether the claims of Welspun, as included in the Final Bill dated
30.10.2010, were barred by limitation.
By:Dushyant Rawal       FAO(OS)(COMM) No.9/2019                                 Page 2 of 48
6.     An Engineering, Procurement and Construction (EPC) contract
in respect of “Balance Offsite & Utilities and Interconnection with
Panipat Refinery / Marketing Terminal (EPCC-9 Package)” in the
Panipat Naphtha Cracker Project was executed between Indian Oil
Corporation Limited (hereafter ‘IOCL’) and Nafto Gaz India Private
Limited (hereafter ‘Nafto Gaz’). The scope of work under the said
EPCC-9 Package included “Design, Engineering, Procurement, Supply
Transport, Fabrication, Construction, Painting, Insulation, Testing and
Commissioning of Raw Water Storage and Treatment Plant, Fire water
System, interconnecting Process Streams between Refinery and
Panipath Naphtha Cracker Project (PNCP) including hook ups with the
existing system, Naphtha unloading and transfer from Panipat
Marketing Terminal to PNCP and construction of inter-connecting
flyover between Panipat Refinery and PNCP”.
7.     Subsequently, Nafto Gaz awarded the said EPC contract in
favour of the respondent (hereafter ‘NCC’). Thereafter, NCC sub-
contracted the work in respect of the inter-connecting flyover between
the existing Panipat Refinery and Panipat Naphtha Cracker Project
(PNCP) to Welspun.
8.     By a Letter of Intent dated 24.10.2006 (hereafter ‘the LoI’), NCC
subcontracted the works in respect of the interconnecting flyover
By:Dushyant Rawal       FAO(OS)(COMM) No.9/2019                                 Page 3 of 48
between Panipat Refinery and PNCP to MSK Projects (India) Ltd.
9.     On 19.12.2006, a Memorandum of Agreement (hereafter ‘the
MoA’) was executed between MSK and NCC. In terms of the said
MoA, NCC had subcontracted the work concerning a flyover project
(hereafter ‘the Project’) on an item rate basis for a total value of ₹53.25
crores, in favour of MSK.
10.    Subsequently, MSK was acquired by Welspun.
11.    On 12.06.2010, the Mechanical Completion Certificate was
issued to Welspun by IOCL.
12.    Thereafter, on 03.08.2010, a meeting was held between the
parties, wherein NCC had agreed to pay various amounts due to
13.    Thereafter, on 30.10.2010, Welspun submitted the Running
Account Bill no. 33/Final Bill. A joint inspection was carried out
thereafter and the said Final Bill was duly certified.
14.    Accordingly, the Completion Certificate was issued by NCC on
30.11.2010. The said certificate recorded the actual date of completion
of works as on 19.03.2010 and the executed contract value of the Project
as “Rs 5216.97 lakhs (excluding service tax) and final bill for Rs 2.64
crore for extra item under certification”
By:Dushyant Rawal       FAO(OS)(COMM) No.9/2019                                  Page 4 of 48
15.    Welspun claims that it had sent various emails to NCC seeking
the payments due to it. Further, various meetings were also held
between the parties, wherein NCC denied its liability to pay the due
amounts at that stage.
16.    In view of the disputes between the parties, Welspun issued a
legal notice dated 21.08.2012 and called upon NCC to pay an amount
of ₹16,68,89,114/- along with interest at the rate of 18% per annum
from 19.03.2010 (the date of completion of the works), within a period
of twenty-one days of the receipt of the notice, failing which it would
invoke the dispute resolution mechanism.
17.    NCC responded to the said notice by a letter dated 10.09.2012.
It claimed that it had awarded the works relating to the contract to MSK
on “back-to-back basis”. It referred to the LoI and claimed that the
MoA was executed on the basis of the LoI. According to NCC, the LoI
had clarified that execution of the Project under the MoA was on a back-
to-back basis. NCC acknowledged that in its record, a sum of ₹2.56
crores was payable to MSK/Welspun, however, it claimed that the
payment would be due on receipt of corresponding payments from
18.    NCC had further mentioned that a huge amount of money for the
work done by MSK as well as by NCC, was outstanding from Nafto
Gaz. It stated that it had been continually appealing to MSK that “the
payments if any shall be cleared, if and only, upon the receipt of
payments from the M/s Naftagoz” and till Nafto Gaz releases payments
By:Dushyant Rawal       FAO(OS)(COMM) No.9/2019                                 Page 5 of 48
to NCC, it would not be liable to pay the amounts as claimed by
19.     Thereafter, on 26.11.2012, in accordance with the Dispute and
Settlement Clause as contained in the MoA, Welspun referred the
dispute to the Chief Executives of NCC and Welspun. However, on
21.12.2012, an attempt to resolve the disputes between the parties
failed.
20.     Thereafter, Welspun invoked the agreement to refer the disputes
to arbitration by a notice dated 27.01.2014.
21.     Welspun filed its Statement of Claims before the Arbitral
Tribunal. It, essentially, raised five claims. Claim no. I was for the
amount certified in the Final Bill for supply (₹19,88,16,796/-), erection
(₹31,68,51,167/-) and extra items (₹3,33,63,921/-). These amounts
were claimed without accounting for the amounts already received.
Claim no. II was for a sum of ₹3,90,86,244/- on account of
reimbursement of service tax. Claim no. III was for a sum of
₹78,87,305.85 on account of escalation in the cost of steel. Claim no.
IV was for a sum of ₹7,31,84,544/- towards reimbursement of payments
made to the suppliers on behalf of NCC. And, Claim no. V was for a
sum of ₹4,21,41,692/- on account of retention money being the amount
retained from various Running Account (RA) Bills. A tabular statement
of the computation of the amounts claimed by Welspun, as set out in its
Statement of Claims, is reproduced below:
By:Dushyant Rawal       FAO(OS)(COMM) No.9/2019                                Page 6 of 48
“Welspun is entitled to the following admitted amounts
Total amount entitled to be received by Welspun                   Rs.66,91,89,978/-
6.    Amount paid by NCC                        (-) Rs.26,08,81,480/-
7.    Debit Notes as accepted by Welspun        (-) Rs.1,42,77,690/-
8.    Material supplied                         (-) Rs.16,27,02,829/-
Adjustments made, as per the terms of the MOA by NCC are
10.   Interest on Mobilisation Advance          (-) Rs.73,94,381/-
22.    In addition to the above, Welspun also claimed interest at the rate
of 18% per annum computed at ₹15,53,02,904/- till 31.12.2015.
Welspun also claimed pendente lite, future interest and costs.
23.    NCC filed a Statement of Defence contesting the aforesaid
claims. It raised a preliminary objection that the claims raised by
Welspun were premature as its contract with MSK/Welspun was on
“back-to-back basis” with its contract with Nafto Gaz. It claimed that
payments to Welspun could be considered only upon certification and
release of the amounts from Nafto Gaz (IOCL to NCC). Since NCC
By:Dushyant Rawal       FAO(OS)(COMM) No.9/2019                                                 Page 7 of 48
had neither received the certification nor payments, the claims to that
extent were pre-mature and the cause of action for making such claims
had not arisen. However, without prejudice to the said contention, NCC
also claimed that Welspun’s claims were barred by limitation and were
liable to be rejected on the principle analogous to Order VII Rule 11 of
the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (hereafter ‘the CPC’). The relevant
extract of the Statement of Defence articulating the said preliminary
objection, is set out below:
“9. The contention of NCC has always been that the
contract with MSK now Welspun was on a back to back
basis with the contract of NCC and NaftoGaz. Therefore,
any claims or payments that Welspun may consider itself
entitled to can be considered only upon certification and
release of such amounts from NaftoGaz/IOCL to NCC.
NCC has neither received the certification nor the
payments. To that extent the claims as raised by Welspun
are premature and the cause of action for the same has not
arisen. NCC is in no position to admit accept or pay any
part of the claim since that depends upon certification by
NaftoGaz and the release of payments by
NaftoGaz/IOCL. This is also a specific term of the
10. Without prejudice to this contention of NCC,
assuming without admitting that Welspun can raise its
claims at this stage, the claims of Welspun as set out in
the Statement of Claim are barred by limitation.
Consequently, the claims as set up are liable to be rejected
on principles analogus to Order VII Rule 11 of the Code
of Civil Procedure 1908.”
24.    NCC also set out in detail its reasoning for claiming that the
contract with MSK was on a back-to-back basis. It also relied upon the
By:Dushyant Rawal       FAO(OS)(COMM) No.9/2019                                   Page 8 of 48
LoI, in support of its defence. In addition to the above, NCC claimed
that Welspun had failed to perform its obligation in a time-bound
manner. It claimed that it also had counter-claims against
MSK/Welspun arising as a result of various defaults on its part.
However, at that stage, it was unable to quantify the claims. According
to NCC, the same could be done only after certification and approvals
from Nafto Gaz and EIL/IOCL.
25.    The Arbitral Tribunal (majority) considered the aforesaid
defence and did not find any merit in NCC’s claim that its contract with
MSK/Welspun was on a back-to-back basis. The Arbitral Tribunal
concluded that “back to back’ payment was not contemplated by the
parties in entering into the MoA dated 19.12.2006”.
26.    Insofar as the question of limitation is concerned, the Arbitral
Tribunal (majority) concluded that Welspun’s claims as included in the
Final Bill (Claim nos. I, II and III) were barred by limitation. Welspun
had relied on the Minutes of the Meeting held on 03.08.2010 between
the parties and asserted that NCC had acknowledged the payments due
to Welspun and agreed to pay the same during the course of the said
meeting. The Arbitral Tribunal (majority) held that the cause of action
for invoking the arbitration had arisen on 03.08.2010, when the promise
to pay was made as well as thereafter, when the Final Bill was certified
(which was done on 30.10.2010). Thus, Welspun’s notice under Section
21 of the A&C Act was beyond the period of three years from the said
date and therefore, the said claims were barred by limitation.
By:Dushyant Rawal       FAO(OS)(COMM) No.9/2019                                 Page 9 of 48
27.    Welspun’s claim for reimbursement of payments made to
suppliers on behalf of NCC (Claim no. IV) was also rejected as being
barred by limitation. The Arbitral Tribunal held that Welspun had
neither pleaded nor proved the date on which such payments were made
to vendors and therefore, the dates of the invoices would be relevant for
considering the question of limitation. The earliest of the invoices was
dated 26.05.2007 and the last invoice was dated 30.06.2008. Since the
invoices were dated more than three years prior to the date of invoking
the arbitration, the claim for reimbursement of the said amount was also
held to be barred by limitation.
28.    However, insofar as the claim for refund of the retention money
is concerned, the Arbitral Tribunal noted that NCC had promised to pay
the same on receipt from Nafto Gaz and therefore, Welspun would be
entitled to receive the same as and when the said amount was received
from Nafto Gaz.
29.    The majority award was signed by all the three Arbitrators.
However, it was specifically mentioned that “As there is a cleavage of
opinion, the Majority Award shall prevail. The Award of Justice K.
Ramamoorthy is appended separately.”
30.    Although, there was no mention of a supplemental award, the
record produced also includes a supplemental award signed by one of
the Arbitrators [Justice (Retd.) Manmohan Sarin], which is undated and
appears to have been penned down to contradict certain findings as
recorded in the minority opinion, captioned ‘Dissenting Award’. The
By:Dushyant Rawal       FAO(OS)(COMM) No.9/2019                                 Page 10 of 48
minority (Dissenting Award) found that Welspun was entitled to its
claims (Claim nos. I, II and III) being the amounts due in terms of the
certified Final Bill.    However, Welspun’s Claim no. IV was not
accepted on the ground that Welspun had not satisfied the requirement
of Section 70 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872. In terms of the
Dissenting Award, Welspun’s claim for interest was also liable to be
allowed to the extent of 9% per annum from 27.01.2014 till the date of
payment. Justice (Retd.) K. Ramamoorthy was of the opinion that
Welspun was entitled to costs quantified at ₹1,14,15,169/- along with
interest at the rate of 9% per annum.
31.    Welspun challenged the impugned award by filing an application
under Section 34 of the A&C Act [being OMP COMM 468/2018
captioned Welspun Enterprises Limited v. NCC Limited]. Welspun
assailed the impugned award on the ground that its claims were raised
within the period of limitation and the Arbitral Tribunal had erroneously
rejected its claims on the said ground. Welspun had also contended that
the defence of NCC was intrinsically inconsistent inasmuch as on one
hand, NCC had contended that the claim preferred by Welspun was pre-
mature and on the other hand, it contended that the claim was barred by
limitation.
32.    The learned Single Judge examined the contentions advanced on
behalf of Welspun and found the same to be unmerited. The learned
Single Judge found that the claim preferred by Welspun was on the
By:Dushyant Rawal       FAO(OS)(COMM) No.9/2019                                 Page 11 of 48
basis of certification of the Final Bill on 29.11.2010 and, accordingly,
held that the cause of action had accrued in favour of Welspun on the
said date. The learned Single Judge further found that the letter dated
10.09.2012, as relied upon by Welspun, did not extend the period of
limitation as mere exchange of correspondence between the parties
could not extend the period of limitation or provide a fresh date of
commencement of cause of action.
33.       The learned Single Judge further referred to Section 21 of the
A&C Act and the decision of the Supreme Court in State of Goa v. M/s
Praveen Enterprises1, wherein it was held that that the date of invoking
arbitration was a determinative factor for the purpose of limitation.
34.       The learned Single Judge accepted that the parties were required
to explore the possibility of settlement through reference of disputes to
their respective Chief Executives, however, concluded that Welspun
had not considered the reference to Chief Executive as a pre-condition
to invocation of the arbitration but an attempt to amicably resolve the
disputes. It is apparent that the learned Single Judge did not accept that
the period of limitation would commence from the failure of the dispute
resolution process on 21.12.2012. The learned Single Judge concurred
with the Arbitral Tribunal that the letter dated 26.11.2012 invoking the
dispute resolution mechanism did not stop the period of limitation.
Paragraphs 11 and 12 of the impugned order are relevant and are set out
By:Dushyant Rawal       FAO(OS)(COMM) No.9/2019                                  Page 12 of 48
Arbitration Agreement between the parties the
petitioner was required to explore the possibility of a
settlement through reference of the dispute to the Chief
Executives of the parties, however, in the present case
the same had also resulted in a failure on 21.12.2012.
the petitioner thereafter invoked the arbitration
proceedings only on 27.01.2014. The petitioner was,
therefore, not considering this reference to the Chief
Executives as a pre condition to the invocation of the
arbitration, but as a step for making an attempt to
amicably resolve the disputes. No reason has been
given by the petitioner for not invoking arbitration
between 21.12.2012 to 27.01.2014.
12.      The Arbitral Tribunal has also considered the
issue of limitation in detail and has held that the letter
dated 26.11.2012 by itself did not stop the period of
limitation from running. It further held that mere
exchange of correspondence between the parties would
not extend the period of limitation and the petitioner
was bound to take recourse to the legal remedy within
the prescribed period of limitation, failing which it was
to suffer the consequences thereof. it has held that all
claims falling under the final bill are therefore, barred
under the Law of Limitation.”
35.    The learned Single Judge also found no cause to interfere with
the impugned award whilst accepting NCC’s contention that the
retention money was refundable once the same was received by NCC
from Nafto Gaz. The learned Single Judge, accordingly, held that the
Arbitral Tribunal was right in holding that the claim for refund of
retention money was pre-mature in nature and therefore, within the
period of limitation.
By:Dushyant Rawal       FAO(OS)(COMM) No.9/2019                                  Page 13 of 48
36.       Mr. Sethi, learned senior counsel appearing for Welspun, assailed
the impugned award as well as the impugned order, essentially, on three
grounds. First, he submitted that the Arbitral Tribunal had erred in not
appreciating NCC’s primary contention that the claims are pre-mature
and therefore, it was not open for NCC to claim that they were barred
by time. He referred to the decisions in the case of Vimal Chand
Ghevar Chand Jain v. Ramakant Eknath Jadoo 2 and Gautam Sarup
v. Leela Jetley & Ors.3, in support of his contention that alternate pleas
are permissible but they cannot be mutually destructive.
37.       Second, he submitted that Welspun had invoked the dispute
resolution mechanism on 26.11.2012, which was within a period of two
years from the date of the Completion Certificate and therefore, the
invocation could not be held as barred by time. He relied on the
decisions of the Supreme Court in State of Orissa & Anr. v. Damodar
Das4, S. Rajan v. State of Kerala5 and Asia Resorts Ltd. v. Usha Berco
38.       Third, he submitted that the assumption that there was only a
singular cause of action, was erroneous. He submitted that the cause of
action could arise on multiple dates and could also continue. He
submitted that the cause of action had also arisen on multiple occasions,
when NCC had accepted its liability to pay. It had simply made it
By:Dushyant Rawal       FAO(OS)(COMM) No.9/2019                                   Page 14 of 48
contingent upon its receipt from Nafto Gaz. It had also arisen on
10.09.2012, when NCC had accepted that the amount was payable,
albeit, on a back-to-back basis. He contended that the jural relationship
was acknowledged and the same was sufficient for the purpose of
extending the period of limitation. He contended that the learned Single
Judge erred in not accepting that the said letter dated 10.09.2012 was
an acknowledgment of debt although a plain reading of the said letter
clearly indicated the same. In support of his contention, Mr. Sethi also
referred to the decisions in J.C. Budhraja v. Chairman, Orissa Mining
Corpn. Ltd.7; Syndicate Bank v. R. Veeranna8; Food Corporation of
India v. Assam State Coop. Marketing & Consumer Federation Ltd.9
and, Lakshmirattan Cotton Mills Co. Ltd. and Behari Lai Ram
Charan v. The Aluminium Corporation of India Ltd.10.
39.       Lastly, Mr. Sethi submitted that the period of limitation would
commence only when the right to refer the matter to arbitration had
arisen. He stated that a reference to arbitration could be made only once
the parties had exhausted the remedy for resolving their disputes
through intervention of their respective Chief Executives. The said
settlement failed on 21.12.2012 and thus, the right to refer the dispute
to arbitration arose on the said date. The arbitration was invoked within
a period of three years from the said date and therefore, was within the
period of limitation. He referred to the decisions in the case of Hari
By:Dushyant Rawal       FAO(OS)(COMM) No.9/2019                                  Page 15 of 48
Shankar Singhania & Ors. v. Gaur Hari Singhania & Ors.11, P.D.
Pillai v. Mrs. Kaliyanikutty Amma and Ors.12 and In Re: Deepika
Housing Projects Ltd. & Ors.13, in support of his contention.
40.       Ms. Priya Kumar, learned counsel appearing for NCC, countered
the aforesaid submissions. She submitted that the time spent by the
Chief Executive Officers of the respective parties in the conciliation
proceedings could not be excluded for the purpose of limitation. She
relied on the decision in the case of Ravinder Kumar Verma v. M/S.
BPTP Ltd. & Anr.14, in support of her contention. She submitted that
the Court had noticed that Section 77 of the A&C Act expressly permits
a party to initiate proceedings to preserve its rights and therefore, it is
open for any party to invoke the arbitration if any further delay would
render the claims barred by limitation.
41.       Next, she submitted that there was no scope for imputing any
equitable considerations in applying the law of limitation. She also
submitted that any party seeking benefit of exclusion under any law was
required to plead and prove the same. In the present appeal, Welspun
had not claimed exclusion of any period on account of reference of the
disputes to the Chief Executive Officers and therefore, it was not open
for Welspun to now claim that the said period ought to be excluded.
By:Dushyant Rawal       FAO(OS)(COMM) No.9/2019                                 Page 16 of 48
42.       She referred to the decision of the Supreme Court in Geo Miller
& Company Pvt. Ltd. v. Chairman, Rajasthan Vidyut Utpadan Nigam
Ltd.15 and contended that the observations made in the said decision
would not be relevant as Welspun had not pleaded any case of extension
of limitation on the ground of negotiations. Thus, there were no
averments as to the “breaking point” of negotiations and therefore,
Welspun is precluded from raising any such plea.
43.       Finally, she submitted that Welspun was attempting to set up a
new case, which was not pleaded and it was impermissible for it to do
so. She referred to the decision of the Supreme Court in Union of India
v. Ibrahim Uddin16, to support her contention.
44.       At the outset, it is relevant to note that the controversy involved
in the present case is in a narrow compass. The limited question to be
addressed is whether the claims raised by Welspun, in respect of the
work done and as included in the Final Bill, are barred by limitation.
45.        It is necessary to note that the facts whether the Completion
Certificate had been issued on 30.11.2010 or the Final Bill had been
certified as stated on 30.10.2010 were to some extent disputed by NCC.
However, the Arbitral Tribunal found that the Final / RA Bill No.33 had
been certified and the Completion Certificate dated 30.11.2010 was
issued. The Arbitral Tribunal also proceeded on the basis that a meeting
By:Dushyant Rawal       FAO(OS)(COMM) No.9/2019                                      Page 17 of 48
was held between the representatives of the parties on 03.08.2010.
Thus, notwithstanding any controversy in regard to these facts, the same
must be accepted to be true for the purpose of determining the question
whether Welspun’s claims were barred by limitation, as was done by
the Arbitral Tribunal.
46.    The first question to be addressed is whether the Arbitral Tribunal
(majority) erred in not appreciating that NCC had taken contradictory
stands. On one hand, it claimed that the claims preferred by Welspun
were pre-mature as such claims could be made only after Nafto Gaz had
certified the work and made the necessary payments. On the other hand,
NCC claimed that they were belated. The contention that Welspun’s
claims were pre-mature was premised on the basis that the contract
between the parties was on a back-to-back basis. As noticed above,
NCC had also averred that the claims raised by Welspun were barred
by limitation. According to NCC, such alternate pleas were permissible
as they were premised on two alternative assumptions: one, that NCC
was not liable to make any payments till it received further payments
from Nafto Gaz and, second, that it was liable to make payments
notwithstanding that it had not received the payments from Nafto Gaz.
In the second scenario, Welspun’s claims would be barred by limitation.
47.    The Arbitral Tribunal had rejected NCC’s contention that such
alternative pleas were available. Welspun had relied on the decision of
the Supreme Court in Vimal Chand Ghevar Chand Jain v. Ramakant
By:Dushyant Rawal       FAO(OS)(COMM) No.9/2019                                  Page 18 of 48
Eknath Jadoo17 and Gautam Sarup v. Leela Jelly and Otters18,
whereby the Supreme Court had held that alternative pleas were
permissible but the same could not be destructive of each other. It was
contended on behalf of NCC that the said decisions were not applicable.
However, the Arbitral Tribunal rejected the said contention. NCC has
not challenged the decision of the Arbitral Tribunal to reject its
contention that such alternative pleas – as taken in its preliminary
objections – are impermissible.
48.       Notwithstanding the above, the Arbitral Tribunal held that it was
required to independently adjudicate the question as the controversy
involved jurisdictional issues. The decision of the Arbitral Tribunal, in
this regard, cannot be faulted. Section 3 of the Limitation Act, 1963
(hereafter ‘the Limitation Act’) expressly requires the court to reject
an action instituted beyond the prescribed period notwithstanding that
no such defence has been set up. By virtue of Section 43 of the A&C
Act, the Limitation Act is also applicable to arbitration.
49.       In view of the above, we are unable to fault the Arbitral
Tribunal’s decision to determine the question of limitation on merits
notwithstanding the inconsistent pleas raised by NCC.
50.       The principal question to be addressed in the present case is the
import of the provision of the pre-arbitration dispute resolution process
By:Dushyant Rawal       FAO(OS)(COMM) No.9/2019                                  Page 19 of 48
on the question of limitation. The Dispute Resolution Clause, as
contained in the MoA, reads as under:
In the event of any dispute, arising between the parties
relating to the various terms and conditions set forth
hereinabove, the parties undertake to resolve the differences
by mutual negotiation. If such dispute or difference cannot be
resolved within one month from the date it is arisen, the same
shall be referred to the Chief Executives of NCC and MSK.
If the Chief Executives also fail to agree then such
differences/disputes shall be referred to a Sole Arbitrator to
be appointed by NCC and MSK by mutual consent.
However, the parties fail to agree upon a Sole Arbitrator with
mutual consent, as aforesaid, MCC and MSK will each
nominate an Arbitrator of their choice, and the two arbitrators
so nominated shall choose a Third Arbitrator. The award of
the Arbitrator/s so appointed shall be final and conclusive and
be binding on both the parties to this Memorandum of
Agreement. The provisions of the Indian Arbitration Act of
1996 or any statutory modification or re-enactment thereof
and the rules made there under for the time being in force
shall apply to the arbitration proceedings under this clause.
The venue of arbitration shall be Delhi”
51.    It is clear from the above that the said Dispute Resolution Clause
requires the parties to make an endeavour to resolve the differences by
mutual negotiations. The parties had agreed that if such disputes could
not be resolved within a period of one month from the date they had
arisen, they would refer the same to their respective Chief Executives.
It is only when the Chief Executives of the respective parties fail to
resolve the same then such differences and disputes would be referred
to arbitration.
By:Dushyant Rawal       FAO(OS)(COMM) No.9/2019                                  Page 20 of 48
52.       The question to be addressed is whether, in the context of the
aforesaid dispute resolution mechanism, the period of limitation would
commence prior to the parties exhausting the agreed pre-reference
procedure/remedies.
53.       Several dispute resolution clauses provide for multi-tier or water
fall dispute resolution mechanisms. These require the parties to
undertake mediation or to first attempt to resolve the dispute in an
alternative forum before resorting to arbitration. The entire purpose is
to provide the parties an opportunity to resolve the disputes in an
amicable manner before resorting to adversarial proceedings.
54.       It is also relevant to bear in mind that the law of limitation does
not extinguish the cause. It only precludes a party from availing the
legal remedies for redressal of the said cause (See: Bombay Dying &
Manufacturing Co. Ltd. v. State of Bombay & Ors.19). Thus, the
question whether a party forfeits its recourse to arbitration on account
of time spent in otherwise trying to resolve the disputes, is required to
be viewed in the aforesaid perspective.
55.       In Panchu Gopal Bose v. Board of Trustee for Port of
Calcutta20, the Supreme Court referred to the decision of the Queen’s
Bench in West Riding of Yorkshire Country Council v. Huddersfield
Corporation21 and held that the rule of limitation would be applicable
to arbitration proceedings in the same manner as it applies to litigation
By:Dushyant Rawal       FAO(OS)(COMM) No.9/2019                                     Page 21 of 48
before courts. In that case, the party had invoked the arbitration process
under the Arbitration Act, 1940 after a period of ten years from the date
it had first put forward its claims. In the facts of the said case, the
Supreme Court found that recourse to arbitration was not available. The
Supreme Court also referred to the text, Russel on Arbitration, 19th
Edn, to posit that the limitation period to commence arbitration, would
start to run “from the date when the claimant first acquired either a right
of action or a right to require that an arbitration takes place upon the
dispute concerned”.
56.      The Supreme Court also noted the following proposition as stated
in the book Law of Arbitration22 by Justice Bachawat:
“The cause of arbitration, therefore, arises when the
claimant becomes entitled to raise the question, i.e. when
the claimant acquires the right to require arbitration. the
limitation would run from the date when cause of
arbitration would have accrued, but for the agreement”.
57.      In view of the above, the period of limitation would run when a
party acquires a right to refer the disputes to arbitration. Clearly, if the
arbitration agreement requires the parties to exhaust the dispute
resolution process as a pre-condition for invoking arbitration, the right
to refer the dispute to arbitration would arise only after the parties have
exhausted the said procedure. The counterparty could raise a valid
objection to any step taken to refer the disputes to arbitration in
avoidance of the agreed pre-reference dispute resolution procedure. If
the parties have agreed that they would first endeavour to resolve the
22 Chapter 37 at Page 549
By:Dushyant Rawal       FAO(OS)(COMM) No.9/2019                                    Page 22 of 48
disputes amicably in a particular manner, it is necessary for them to first
exhaust that procedure before exercising any right to refer the disputes
to arbitration.
58.       In Hari Shankar Singhania & Ors. v. Gaur Hari Singhania &
Ors.23, the Supreme Court categorically held that a reference to
arbitration “is required to be filed within a period of three years when
the right to apply accrues”. It is, therefore, crucial to determine when
such ‘right to apply’ accrues in a case. As per the Court, the right to
apply would accrue when differences between the parties to the
arbitration agreement were evident – when the parties reach a ‘breaking
point’, that is, when a settlement with or without conciliation is no
longer possible. Pertinently, the Court noted that the limitation period
would not start so long as the parties were in dialogue even if
differences surfaced during such period, as an interpretation to the
contrary would inevitably “compel the parties to resort to litigation /
arbitration even where there is serious hope of the parties themselves
resolving the issues”. Thus, the right to apply can be said to have
accrued “only on the date of the last correspondence between the parties
and the period of limitation commences from the date of the last
communication between the parties.”
59.       In this regard, the Supreme Court also referred to the findings of
the High Court of Delhi in Oriental Building and Furnishing Co. Ltd.
v. Union of India24, wherein the High Court had, inter alia, held that
By:Dushyant Rawal       FAO(OS)(COMM) No.9/2019                                   Page 23 of 48
“[n]either party can move the Court without the existence of a
difference between them [...] there can be negotiations between the
parties and all sorts of correspondence. But it is only when they come
to the conclusion that they cannot resolve the dispute between them, it
can be said that a difference arises.”
60.       It is also important to note that: (i) this judgment was rendered in
the context of the Arbitration Act, 1940; (ii) the controversy in the case
involved a family dispute; (iii) the correspondences exchanged between
the parties were not merely in the nature of reminders but various letters
to amicably negotiate and resolve the matter; and, (iv) the
correspondences revealed an inclination to implementing the deed of
dissolution in that case and amicably settling the family dispute.
61.       Subsequently, in Shree Ram Mills Ltd. v. Utility Premises (P)
Ltd.25, the Supreme Court relied on the decision of Hari Shankar
Singhania & Ors. v. Gaur Hari Singhania & Ors.26 to state that “till
such time as the settlement talks are going on directly or by way of
correspondence no issue arises and with the result the clock of
limitation does not start ticking”. Hence, there would be no question of
stifling the right to arbitration where settlement talks were ongoing.
This is because the issue between the parties would be live and
therefore, the three-year limitation period stipulated under Article 137
of the Limitation Act cannot be said to have lapsed. In this regard, the
By:Dushyant Rawal       FAO(OS)(COMM) No.9/2019                                      Page 24 of 48
Court also placed reliance on its earlier decision in Groupe Chimique
Tunisien SA v. Southern Petrochemicals Industries Corpn. Ltd.27
62.       In the year 2019, after considering the law thus far on the issue
of limitation period in the context of accrual of the cause of action for
arbitration proceedings to commence, the three-Judge Bench of the
Supreme Court in Geo Miller & Company Pvt. Ltd. v. Chairman,
Rajasthan Vidyut Utpadan Nigam Ltd.28 enunciated the following
(i)       Mere exchange of correspondence between the parties would not
be sufficient to extend the time of limitation – specific pleadings
and evidence qua the parties’ bona fide negotiation history should
be placed on record for the careful consideration of the Court and
for the benefit of limitation (as discussed above) to enure in
favour of such party. On this basis, the Court ascertains the
‘breaking point’, that is, the point when a reasonable party would
abandon settlement efforts and contemplate referring the dispute
to arbitration.
(ii)      A party must not wait for an unreasonably long period to invoke
the arbitration proceedings, if the counterparty does not settle and
merely because written correspondences, including reminders,
are being sent to the counterparty.
By:Dushyant Rawal       FAO(OS)(COMM) No.9/2019                                     Page 25 of 48
(iii)    Commercial or mercantile disputes are inherently different in
nature from family disputes.       The Supreme Court in Hari
Shankar Singhania & Ors. v. Gaur Hari Singhania & Ors.29
was concerned with a family dispute and the findings in that case
were specifically rendered in that context. Thus, the threshold for
determining the ‘breaking point’ in commercial disputes would
differ – and would be lower – as parties in commercial settings
are primarily interested in securing the amounts due to them.
(iv)     Whilst the scheme evolved under the A&C Act was different
from the erstwhile Arbitration Act, 1940, the principles
applicable in relation to the law of limitation under both the
statues would be the same. Therefore, the Supreme Court
affirmed that the three-year limitation period stipulated under
Article 137 of the Limitation Act, applicable to arbitration
proceedings, commenced under the Arbitration Act, 1940 would
equally be applicable under the A&C Act in the context of
appointment of an arbitrator under Section 11 of the A&C Act.
63.      As stated above, a party cannot be expected to commence
arbitration without exhausting the pre-reference procedure. One of the
principal questions that arises in this context is whether the time spent
for complying with the pre-reference procedure is required to be
excluded while calculating the period of limitation for referring the
disputes to arbitration or whether the period of limitation would
By:Dushyant Rawal       FAO(OS)(COMM) No.9/2019                                   Page 26 of 48
commence after the said procedure has been exhausted. In this context,
the decision of the Supreme Court in Geo Miller & Company Pvt. Ltd.
v. Chairman, Rajasthan Vidyut Utpadan Nigam Ltd.30 is instructive.
Paragraph 28 of the said decision is relevant and set out below:
“28. Having perused through the relevant precedents, we
agree that on a certain set of facts and circumstances, the
period during which the parties were bona fide negotiating
towards an amicable settlement may be excluded for the
purpose of computing the period of limitation for reference
to arbitration under the 1996 Act. However, in such cases
the entire negotiation history between the parties must be
specifically pleaded and placed on the record. The Court
upon careful consideration of such history must find out
what was the “breaking point” at which any reasonable
party would have abandoned efforts at arriving at a
settlement and contemplated referral of the dispute for
arbitration. This “breaking point” would then be treated as
the date on which the cause of action arises, for the purpose
of limitation. The threshold for determining when such a
point arises will be lower in the case of commercial
disputes, where the party's primary interest is in securing
the payment due to them, than in family disputes where it
may be said that the parties have a greater stake in settling
the dispute amicably, and therefore delaying formal
adjudication of the claim.”
64.      Although the Court observed that the period spent by the parties
in negotiating an amicable settlement is required to be excluded,
however, in the latter part of the aforesaid passage, the Court, in
unambiguous terms stated that the cause of action for the purpose of
By:Dushyant Rawal       FAO(OS)(COMM) No.9/2019                                    Page 27 of 48
limitation would commence from the ‘breaking point’ of the
negotiations.
65.      In Alstom Systems India Pvt. Ltd. v. Zillion Infraprojects Pvt.
Ltd.31, a Single Bench of this Court had considered the question whether
the period of limitation for referring the disputes to arbitration would
commence from the date of failure of mediation. The Court referred to
the decision of the Supreme Court in Geo Miller & Company Pvt. Ltd.
v. Chairman, Rajasthan Vidyut Utpadan Nigam Ltd.32 and held as
“21. No doubt, the opening sentence of para 28 in Geo
Miller talks of exclusion of the period of negotiation,
while computing the period of limitation for the
purposes of 1996 Act. Mr. Sethi had, with some
justification, sought to capitalize on this observation to
contend that, at best, the learned Arbitral Tribunal could
only have excluded the period during which the
petitioner and the respondent were negotiating. The
learned Arbitral Tribunal could not, submits Mr. Sethi,
have postponed the cause of action to 27th September
2020, when the efforts at mediation failed.
22. If one were to read the first sentence in para 28 of
Geo Miller divorced from the rest of the paragraph,
perhaps this submission might have merited
consideration. It is, however, trite that the judgments of
Court are not to be read like statutes. Equally, words
used by the Supreme Court, in its judgements, are all to
be accorded due importance. A paragraph in a
judgement is to be read as a whole, and not in a
vivisected fashion, relying on one sentence and
31 OMP(COMM) No.351/2021, decided on 31.01.2022
By:Dushyant Rawal       FAO(OS)(COMM) No.9/2019                                    Page 28 of 48
overlooking others. Para 28 of Geo Miller clearly goes
on to hold that, once the ‘breaking point’, being the date
on which any reasonable party would have abandoned
the efforts at settlement, is determined, the cause of
action would be deemed to arise from that date, for
referring the dispute to arbitration. These words are
clear, unambiguous and unequivocal. They entirely
support the view, expressed by the learned Arbitral
Tribunal, that the cause of action, in the present case,
would be deemed to arise on 7th September 2020, being
the date on which efforts at mediation between the
parties ultimately failed. That once the ‘breaking point’,
being the date on which any reasonable party would
have abandoned the efforts at settlement, is determined,
the cause of action would be deemed to arise from that
date, for referring the dispute to arbitration. These words
are clear, unambiguous and unequivocal.”
66.    We concur with the aforesaid view. The period of limitation for
referring the disputes to arbitration cannot commence till the parties
have exhausted the necessary pre-reference procedure. If the arbitration
clause requires the parties to engage in negotiations or to attempt to
resolve the disputes in mediation/conciliation, the right to refer the
disputes to arbitration would arise only after the negotiations for an
amicable settlement have failed and the parties have exhausted their
endeavors to resolve the disputes through mediation/conciliation.
67.    Several courts in various decisions have consistently held that
pre-reference arbitration mediation/settlement processes are required to
run the full course. Even in cases where such processes have consumed
a significant period of time, the courts have held that the cause of action
By:Dushyant Rawal       FAO(OS)(COMM) No.9/2019                                   Page 29 of 48
to invoke the arbitration would arise only after such process has
irrevocably broken down.
68.       In TVC India Pvt. Ltd. v. ABN Amro Bank N.V.33, a Single
Bench of this Court had considered a situation where the contractually
mandated pre-arbitration process had stretched far beyond the
contemplated one-day mediation, that is, over a period of two years. In
the aforesaid context, this Court held as under:
“6…..In the present case Hon'ble Mr. Justice K.
Ramamoorthy (a former Judge of this Court) was appointed
as a mediator with the consent of both the parties. However,
instead of one day mediation agreed by the parties in the
agreement, the proceedings before the mediator went on for
about two years when the respondent admittedly withdrew
itself from the mediation proceedings on 30.6.2006. It shall
be significant to mention that the respondent acquiesced
itself in the mediation proceedings by continuing in the
mediation proceedings till 30.6.2006. It was only after the
mediation failed or could not work, the petitioner has to file
the present petition for appointment of an Arbitrator for
resolving the dispute that have arisen between the parties
under the contract. In the opinion of this Court the cause of
action for appointment of Arbitrator has arisen in favor of
the petitioner when the mediation did not work out as a
result of withdrawal by the respondent on 30.6.2006. In case
the limitation for filing of the present petition is reckoned
from the said date of 30.6.2006, the present petition filed by
the petitioner on 13.11.2006 cannot be said to be beyond
limitation prescribed in Article 137 of the Limitation Act.”
By:Dushyant Rawal       FAO(OS)(COMM) No.9/2019                                     Page 30 of 48
69.      In National Highways Authority v. Progressive Construction
Ltd.34, a Single Bench of this Court considered a case whether the
disputes had been pending resolution before a committee constituted by
the petitioner (National Highways Authority). The reference of the
disputes to a committee was not a part of the dispute resolution clause;
the committee had been set up in an ad hoc fashion after the disputes
had arisen during the performance of the contract in question. The
process for amicable resolution of disputes continued for almost six
years before it was explicitly rejected. Thereafter, the disputes were
referred to arbitration. In the arbitral proceedings, an objection was
raised that the claims were barred by limitation. It was contended that
the period of limitation commenced from the original date when the
disputes had first arisen prior to reference of the same to the committee.
The Arbitral Tribunal rejected the said contention and found that the
claims were within the period of limitation. The arbitral award was
challenged before this Court. The learned Single Judge of this Court
upheld the arbitral award and observed as under:
“20. On reading of the findings of the Arbitral Tribunal
it would disclose that the arguments of the petitioner on
the issue of limitation are without any force, as there is
a finding of fact by the Arbitral Tribunal that the
Variation Orders for the entire increased quantity were
not issued on 26th March, 2003, and yet further the issue
as to the revision of the rates was under the active
consideration of the respondent for a very long time
from 29th May, 2003, to 27th April, 2009, as the
respondent had formed a Committee for revising the
rates and forwarding the revised rates to NHAI for
By:Dushyant Rawal       FAO(OS)(COMM) No.9/2019                                   Page 31 of 48
approval, and the respondent had also appeared before
the Committee in an attempt to amicably resolve the
issue. The respondent rejected the proposal for revised
rates only on 27th April, 2009, and therefore the
contention of the petitioner is that the cause of action
began on 26th March, 2003, cannot be accepted. It is
settled law that when the parties are actively trying to
resolve the disputes, then the cause of action for
resorting to arbitration cannot be said to have
commenced.”
70.      The decision of the learned Single Judge in National Highways
Authority v. Progressive Construction Ltd.35 was upheld by a Division
Bench of this Court by an order dated 08.09.2014 36. The relevant
extract of the said decision reads as under:
“24. The third condition concerns limitation.
25. As per NHAI the cause of action arose when variation
order for change in quantity of items were issued on
26. The learned Single Judge has noted that the learned
Arbitral Tribunal has dealt with the factual aspect of this
issue, which reasoning has been verbatim noted in
paragraph 19 of the impugned decision.
27. Pithily stated that the learned Single Judge has
brought out that after the variation order, notifying
change of quantities, was issued on March 26, 2003,
parties discussed the vexed question of in what manner
the same had to translate into price payable to the
contractor. The learned Single Judge has noted that the
Arbitral Tribunal had succinctly brought out that the
variation order issued on March 26, 2003 was not for an
36 National Highways Authority v. Progressive Construction Ltd.: FAO(OS) No.401/2014
By:Dushyant Rawal       FAO(OS)(COMM) No.9/2019                                                      Page 32 of 48
entire increased quantity. The learned Single Judge has
noted that the Arbitral Tribunal has brought out the
impact of the issue of revision of rates being discussed.
The learned Single Judge has noted that on April 27,
2009, NHAI itself had formed a committee to resolve the
impasse. To put it pithily, the dispute was not on the
increased quantity as per price variation; the dispute
concerned the revision of rates. It is not the case of NHAI
that on a particular date it unequivocally closed the
chapter on the revision of the rates leaving no further
scope for any discussion and further with respect to said
date cause of action would accrue.
28. The objections filed by NHAI show a total confusion
in the mind of NHAI between a cause of action and cause
of action accruing. Whereas the former encompasses such
facts, if traversed, required to be proved to sustain a
claim, the latter would mean the date on which the right
to sue accrues.”
71.      It is necessary to note that the Coordinate Bench of this Court had
held that there was a clear distinction between “cause of action” for
prosecuting a claim and the “cause of action accruing” for invoking
arbitration.
72.      In Delhi Jal Board v. Mohini Electricals Ltd.37, a Single Judge
of this Court (one of us, Vibhu Bakhru, J.) upheld the decision of the
dispute adjudicating board (DAB) holding that the limitation would not
commence till the right to refer the disputes to arbitration had arisen.
The relevant extract of the said decision reads as under:
By:Dushyant Rawal       FAO(OS)(COMM) No.9/2019                                     Page 33 of 48
“43. In the facts of the present case, the respondent had
made its claims and invoked the dispute resolution
mechanism. The period of limitation in respect of the
claims had stopped running once the claims had been
referred to the DAB. There was inordinate delay in
constituting the DAB. As noted above, this was the
subject matter of protracted correspondence. Finally, one
of the consortium partners of the respondent was
compelled to approach this Court and the DAB was
constituted thereafter. The DAB did not render its
decision, however, the parties agreed to close the said
proceedings and refer the disputes to arbitration.
44. The Arbitral Tribunal had referred to the aforesaid
facts and concluded that the parties were involved in the
resolution of the disputes through dispute redressal
mechanism as contemplated under Clause 20 of the
Agreement. The Arbitral Tribunal held that the limitation
would not commence till the right to refer the disputes to
arbitration had arisen. The said right arose on 05.03.2018
when the parties agreed to close the DAB proceedings
and refer the disputes to arbitration. The Arbitral Tribunal
held that even if the date on which the respondent
requested for appointment of the Arbitrator is considered
(that is 17.07.2017), the claims would be within the
period of limitation.
45. This Court finds no infirmity with the aforesaid
decision. The period of limitation in respect of any
dispute would stop running once the parties had invoked
the dispute resolution mechanism. Undeniably, if there is
an inordinate delay on the part of any party to implement
the dispute resolution mechanism, the party seeking
redressal of the disputes would require to take appropriate
action within a period of three years. In the present case,
the respondent (its JV partner) had taken pro-active steps
for implementing the dispute resolution mechanism by
approaching this Court by filing a writ petition.”
By:Dushyant Rawal       FAO(OS)(COMM) No.9/2019                                 Page 34 of 48
73.      Ms. Priya Kumar, who appeared on behalf of NCC, relied upon
the decision of a learned Single Judge of this Court in Ravinder Kumar
Verma v. M/S. BPTP Ltd. & Anr.38. In that case, the Court had held
that the pendency of the conciliation proceedings would not be a bar for
enforcing rights to refer the disputes to arbitration by filing an
application under Section 11 of the A&C Act or seeking dismissal of
the suit under Section 8 of the A&C Act. The Court had reasoned that
such proceedings would be necessary to preserve the rights and to
ensure that the claims are not barred by limitation. The Court had held
that since Section 77 of the A&C Act permits the parties to institute
proceedings, which are necessary for preserving their rights, it is open
for the parties to move applications under Sections 8 and 11 of the A&C
Act to save their claims from being barred by limitation.
74.      Ms. Priya Kumar had earnestly contended that the said decision
amply clarifies that the period of limitation would neither be suspended
nor its commencement deferred in the event of any mediation on
account of the parties engaging in any pre-reference dispute resolution
process.
75.      We are unable to concur with the aforesaid reasoning of the
learned Single Judge in Ravinder Kumar Verma v. M/S. BPTP Ltd. &
Anr.39. Section 77 of the A&C Act expressly proscribes the parties from
initiating any judicial proceedings in respect of disputes that are subject
matter of conciliation proceedings except where in the opinion of the
By:Dushyant Rawal       FAO(OS)(COMM) No.9/2019                                 Page 35 of 48
party “such proceedings are necessary for preserving his rights”. The
period of limitation to refer the disputes to arbitration commences only
upon the parties exhausting the necessary pre-reference procedure,
hence, the question of taking recourse to Section 11 of the A&C Act for
appointment of an arbitrator for preserving the right to arbitration does
not arise.
76.     The necessary question to be addressed is whether the period of
limitation for referring the disputes to arbitration commences to run
prior to the parties exhausting the agreed pre-reference procedures. In
our view, the answer is in the negative. If the period of limitation does
not commence running till the pre-arbitration processes have been
exhausted – as has been held in various decisions– there is no need for
protecting the remedy of arbitration against the bar of limitation prior
to completion of the pre-reference procedure. We are unable to accept
that if the arbitration agreement requires a party to refer the disputes to
conciliation before referring the same to arbitration, the period of
limitation would commence prior to the parties exhausting the remedy
to resolve the disputes through conciliation.
77.     The idea of mediation, even in cases of litigation, is encouraged
in many countries. Austria, for example, provides methods of regulating
limitation periods and permits suspension of such limitation period
before initiating court proceedings. Poland requires for interruption of
the limitation period in cases of pre-litigation mediation, that is, the
limitation period ceases entirely upon commencement of the mediation
process. The position in Hungary appears to be similar. In Singapore,
By:Dushyant Rawal       FAO(OS)(COMM) No.9/2019                                  Page 36 of 48
however, the mediation process does not generally postpone or pause
the period expended in settlements efforts before invoking arbitration.
78.       Article 8(1) of the European Directive of Mediation provides as
“Effect of mediation on limitation and prescription
1.      Member States shall ensure that parties who choose
mediation in an attempt to settle a dispute are not
subsequently prevented from initiating judicial proceedings
or arbitration in relation to that dispute by the expiry of
limitation or prescription periods during the mediation
process.”
79.       In the United Kingdom, Section 27 of the Arbitration Act, 1950
as well as Section 12 of the Arbitration Act, 1996 empower the courts
to extend the time for commencement of arbitration. Such power has
been exercised by the courts to extend limitation where delay was
caused due to parties attempting to settle the disputes amicably.
80.       In the decision of Liberian Shipping Corporation v. A. King &
Sons40, the Court of Appeal considered the question of extending the
period of limitation for commencing arbitration where the delay was
caused because the parties preferred to settle their disputes. In that case,
the owners of the vessel had let out the vessel to charterers. There was
delay in loading and discharge of goods on account of fire. In that
context, cross claims were filed. The owners of the vessel claimed
damages for the delay caused to the vessel by fire. The charterers, on
By:Dushyant Rawal       FAO(OS)(COMM) No.9/2019                                   Page 37 of 48
the other hand, claimed damages for extra expenses incurred by them
in arranging transport on account of the failure to discharge the vessel
at the designated port.      The parties engaged in negotiations for
settlement of the disputes. The settlement efforts consumed the
limitation period of three months provided for initiating arbitration in
terms of the charterparty. The owners, nine days after the time limit had
expired, applied to the Court (Master Lawrence) under Section 27 and
their plea for extending the period of limitation was allowed.
81.     Upon an appeal (before Donaldson J.) being preferred by the
charterers, the same was reversed. Thereafter, when the matter was
referred to the Court of Appeal, the issue essentially came down to
whether the owners were time-barred from initiating arbitration because
they were nine days out of time. The Court of Appeal rendered a 2:1
decision, in favour of the owners. The decision was based on the
interpretation of the phrase ‘undue hardship’ provided in Section 27 of
the Arbitration Act, 1950. Lord Denning, in his majority opinion, held
that the owners would suffer undue hardship if they were barred. Lord
Salmon, in his separate concurring decision, observed that although the
parties were breathing fire against each other, it was obvious from the
letters that they did express willingness to meet and see if the matter
could be settled. Accordingly, he observed that “I have no doubt at all
that if two ordinary business men entering into this contract had been
asked if it would cause undue hardship to refuse to extend the time
should circumstances such as the present occur, they would both
unhesitatingly have answered ‘Yes’.” Lord Salmon also enumerated
By:Dushyant Rawal       FAO(OS)(COMM) No.9/2019                                 Page 38 of 48
certain factors to be considered: the degree of blameworthiness of the
claimants in failing to appoint an arbitrator within time; the amount at
stake; the length of the delay; whether the claimants had been misled;
and whether, through circumstances beyond their control, it was
impossible for them to appoint an arbitrator in time. The majority,
therefore, observed that not allowing an extension of limitation would
cause undue hardship to the owners. Therefore, the appeal was allowed.
82.      The Canadian courts have also taken a view that the period of
limitation would commence on break down of the pre-arbitral
resolution process. In the recent decision of Jean Maisonneuve and
3721094 Canada Inc. v. Christopher Clark and Lanciter Consulting
Inc.41, the parties had referred their business disputes to arbitration. In
the year 2016, they settled all disputes except one (referred to as the
‘Excluded Issue’). The mutual release signed by the parties, inter alia,
contemplated for the reference of the Excluded Issue to arbitration in
case the parties were unable to resolve the same amicably.
83.      In the year 2017, the parties got involved in litigation over the
validity of the said settlement agreement as a whole. In the year 2018,
the appellant took the position that there would be no negotiation
regarding the Excluded Issue. In 2019, the respondent wrote to the
appellant seeking to initiate arbitration. The appellant refused this
request on the ground that it was time-barred. When the respondent
moved the superior court, the appellant took the same ground stating
By:Dushyant Rawal       FAO(OS)(COMM) No.9/2019                                 Page 39 of 48
that the ninety-day period or, in the alternative, the two-year limitation
period provided in the limitation statute had already expired.
84.      The court held that there was no agreement to conduct the
arbitration within a ninety-day period and further held that the
arbitration was not barred by the two-year limitation period under the
limitation statute because “[i]t was not evident that the arbitration was
‘appropriate’ until it was clear that the dispute could not be resolved
through negotiations”, in terms of the relevant statutory provision.
Accordingly, the court found that it was only in the year 2018 that the
respondent could have known that a settlement qua the Excluded Issue
was not possible. On that basis, the respondent’s application was
considered to have been made within the two-year limitation period.
85.      The Court of Appeal for Ontario upheld the aforesaid decision.
86.      In PQ Licensing S.A., Vincent Herbert and Jean-Marie Josi v.
LPQ Central Canada Inc.42, the appellant and the respondent had
executed a franchise agreement. In 2009, the respondent/franchisee
served a rescission notice on the appellant/franchisor. This was disputed
by the appellant/franchisor soon upon receipt.
87.      In 2011, the respondent/franchisee commenced action before the
superior court. The appellant/franchisor objected to these proceedings
on the ground that the franchise agreement required that the parties
mediate before commencement of arbitration. At that point, there was
By:Dushyant Rawal       FAO(OS)(COMM) No.9/2019                                  Page 40 of 48
disagreement between the parties as to whether the requirement to
mediate was inapplicable owing to breaches on the part of the
appellant/franchisor, effectively rendering the franchise agreement
void. As the matter remained dormant for a while, it was
administratively dismissed for delay in 2013.
88.     When the respondent/franchisee attempted to revive the case, the
appellant/franchisor contended that the respondent/franchisee had
failed to timely commence the arbitration. Subsequently, a sole
arbitrator was appointed to determine whether the arbitration was time-
barred for not being commenced within a period of two years from
2009, that is, when the appellant/franchisor had disputed the
respondent/franchisee rescission notice.
89.     The sole arbitrator concluded that the dispute was not time-barred
as the agreement contemplated mediation as a pre-condition to the
arbitration and therefore, the arbitration was not ‘appropriate’ for
commencement until after the mediation requirement was complied
with.
90.     The Appeal Judge agreed with the arbitrator and specifically
observed that “[i]f the claim is the kind of claim that can be remedied
by another and more effective method provided for in the statute, then
a civil action will not be appropriate until that other method has been
used.” It was held that the interpretation of the word ‘appropriate’ to
initiate arbitration depended on “the parties’ choice to have their
disputes resolved by arbitration if mediation as a precondition [was]
By:Dushyant Rawal       FAO(OS)(COMM) No.9/2019                                  Page 41 of 48
unsuccessful.” The Court of Appeal for Ontario agreed with the findings
of the Appeal Judge below and held that as per the interpretation of the
word ‘appropriate’ and the given factual matrix, “the parties would only
know that arbitration was appropriate when the mediation requirement
had been exhausted.” The Court of Appeal, therefore, dismissed the
appeal.
91.    It is also apposite to bear in mind that the legislative as well as
judicial policy is to promote mediation and encourage the parties to
make a serious endeavor for an amicable resolution of the disputes
before commencing any adversarial proceedings. Section 12A of the
Commercial Courts Act, 2015 makes it mandatory for the parties to
exhaust the remedy of mediation prior to institution of the suit in such
manner as may be prescribed. Sub-Section (3) of Section 12A of the
Commercial Courts Act, 2015 expressly provides that the period during
which the parties remained occupied with the pre-institution mediation
would not be computed for the purpose of limitation under the
92.    In the facts of the present case, the Arbitration Clause expressly
required the parties to attempt resolving the disputes and differences by
mutual negotiations. If the efforts to resolve the disputes did not yield
fruit within a period of one month from the date the same had arisen,
the parties were bound to refer the disputes to their respective Chief
Executives. The parties could refer the disputes to arbitration only if
the Chief Executives failed to arrive at a consensus.
By:Dushyant Rawal       FAO(OS)(COMM) No.9/2019                                  Page 42 of 48
93.    NCC had agreed to make the payments at the meeting held on
03.08.2010 and the Minutes of the Meeting record the same. The
Final/RA Bill no.33 was certified on 30.10.2010 and the Completion
Certificate was issued on 30.11.2010. According to Welspun, the
amounts were due and payable in terms of the MoA. According to
Welspun, the amounts were required to be paid within a period of one
month from the date of certification of the bills, that is, on or before
94.    Welspun sent a letter dated 17.05.2011 requesting for release of
payments amounting to ₹13,17,12,365/-, which according to Welspun
were due and payable. This was followed by other e-mails dated
20.07.2011 and 22.07.2011.           It is apparent from the said
communications that the parties had discussions in the meanwhile. The
e-mail dated 22.07.2011 sent by Welspun also indicates that during the
course of discussions, NCC had indicated that the payments would be
linked on back-to-back basis with its client (Nafto Gaz/IOCL).
According to Welspun, the payments could not be linked to receipts
from Nafto Gaz and it had asserted so in its e-mail dated 22.07.2011.
Thereafter, Welspun sent another letter dated 09.09.2011 calling upon
NCC to pay the said amount. This was again followed by another letter
dated 31.10.2011. There were also certain other e-mails that were sent
by Welspun. Finally, on 21.08.2012, Welspun issued a notice through
its counsel.
95.    It is material to note that NCC responded to the said notice by a
letter dated 10.09.2012. In its response, NCC reiterated its stand that
By:Dushyant Rawal       FAO(OS)(COMM) No.9/2019                               Page 43 of 48
the contract between the parties was on back-to-back basis and the
payments to Welspun were subject to NCC receiving corresponding
payments from Nafto Gaz. The relevant extract of the said letter is set
“…….Your client is well aware that the payments to be
made to your client are subject to receiving the
corresponding payment from Naftogaz. Your Client is
well aware that huge amounts due and payable by
Naftogaz not only pertaining to the flyover project
executed by your Client but also in respect of the other
projects executed by NCC have been withheld by
Naftogaz/IOCL. Your client knowing fully well that the
LOI which was issued on back to back basis is the
foundation for the contract awarded to your Client
willfully concealed the same. We also observe that your
client vide letters dated 17.05.2011, 30.08.2011 and
09.09.2011 demanded payment of Rs.13.17 Crores
towards the supposed out standings in respect of the
contract executed by them and whereas through the legal
notice you have claimed an amount of Rs.16,68,89,114/-
towards the supposed out standings. The figures
appearing in the above referred letters of your Client and
also those appearing in your notice are imaginary and
have no basis. We observed from our records that
subject to receiving the corresponding payment from
Naftogaz an amount of Rs.2.56 Crores appears to be
payable to your Client in respect of the works executed
by them. As the contract awarded to your Clients is on
back to back basis, the liability to make the payment
even in respect of the said amount of Rs.2.56 Crores
would arise only on receipt of the corresponding
payment from Naftogaz. Your client is well aware that
huge amounts for the works done by your client and also
for the works done by NCC for Naftogaz are outstanding
from Naftogaz for a very long time.
By:Dushyant Rawal       FAO(OS)(COMM) No.9/2019                                 Page 44 of 48
Your Client is also well aware that on account of
failure of the various contractors who have executed the
various items of work forming part of the EPCC – 9
project awarded by IOCL to Naftogaz the said IOCL has
levied LDs including on the scope of work executed by
your client. We reliably understand that discussions are
in progress between Naftogaz and IOCL for refunding
the amount recovered by them towards LDs. Your Clint
willfully withheld disclosing the aforesaid levy of LDs
in respect of the works executed by them. You will also
note that the amounts claimed by your Client towards
extra items of works were never submitted on time. Our
liability to pay the amounts that were recovered towards
LDs and also the payments towards extra claims if any
could be considered only after we receive the
corresponding payment from the Employer i.e.
Naftogaz. You will also note that the amounts recovered
by IOCL towards Retention Money is yet to be refunded
till date. Our liability to remit the amounts due to your
Client towards the Retention Money will arise only after
release of the corresponding payment by Naftogaz.
Time and again, we have been continually
appealing to your Client that the payments if any shall
be cleared, if and only, upon the receipt of payments
from the M/s Naftogaz. Therefore, we request your
good selves to advise your Client that to be bound by the
agreed terms and conditions of the LOI as such till M/s
Naftogaz India Pvt. Ltd., releases the pending payments
to us, we are not liable to clear the amounts as claimed
by your Client and the same are disputed for the reasons
stated above.”
96.   Welspun was not expected to immediately institute the dispute
resolution mechanism on the Completion Certification being issued on
30.11.2010. The letter dated 10.09.2012 indicates that the controversy
By:Dushyant Rawal       FAO(OS)(COMM) No.9/2019                                 Page 45 of 48
between the parties had crystalized after 30.11.2010. However, it is
also clear from the letter dated 10.09.2012 that the disputes had arisen
between the parties and the parties had failed to resolve the same.
Within a period of three months after receipt of the letter dated
10.09.2012, Welspun invoked the dispute resolution mechanism and by
a letter dated 26.11.2012, made a request for their respective Chief
Executives to meet to resolve the disputes.
97.    It is not clear as and when the negotiations between the parties to
amicably resolve the disputes commenced and failed. However, it is
clear that Welspun had escalated resolution of the disputes to the second
tier by seeking a reference to the respective Chief Executives well
within the period of limitation. Clearly, Welspun could not have sought
a reference to arbitration prior to referring the disputes for resolution to
the respective Chief Executives. Concededly, an attempt to resolve the
disputes by the Chief Executives failed on 21.12.2012. It is on the said
date that the right to refer the disputes arose in favour of Welspun.
Welspun could not have referred the disputes prior to exhausting the
remedies of referring the disputes to the respective Chief Executives for
resolution. The period of limitation for referring the disputes to
arbitration thus, must commence from the said date, that is, 21.12.2012.
Welspun commenced arbitration on 27.01.2014, that is, after a period
of thirteen months and six days, which was within the period of three
years from the date on which the right to refer the disputes to arbitration
arose.
By:Dushyant Rawal       FAO(OS)(COMM) No.9/2019                                  Page 46 of 48
98.    In view of the above, it is clear that the decision of the Arbitral
Tribunal (majority) to reject the claims made by Welspun as being
barred by limitation is erroneous and the impugned award is liable to be
set aside. The said error is self-evident from the record.
99.    The learned Single Judge accepted that it was necessary for the
parties to explore the possibility of settlement through reference of the
disputes to the Chief Executives before invoking the arbitration.
However, the learned Single Judge erroneously concluded that Welspun
was not considering the reference to the Chief Executives as a pre-
condition for invocation of the arbitration but as a step for attempting
an amicable resolution of the disputes.
100. This Court is unable to concur with the said view. Once it is
accepted that it is necessary for Welspun to make a reference of the
disputes to the Chief Executives of the parties, it follows that Welspun
could seek a reference to arbitration only if the said proceedings were
terminated. As noted above, the reference to the Chief Executives of the
parties resulted in failure on 21.12.2012. Welspun could have invoked
the arbitration immediately thereafter but its failure to do so does not
render its reference barred by the Limitation Act.
101. Insofar as Welspun’s Claim no. IV – claim relating to
reimbursement of various invoices, which Welspun claims that it had
paid on behalf of NCC – is concerned, this Court finds no fault with the
decision that the same is barred by limitation. This is because Welspun
has taken no steps to escalate any dispute in regard to this claim within
a reasonable period of time.        The last of the invoices was dated
By:Dushyant Rawal       FAO(OS)(COMM) No.9/2019                                  Page 47 of 48
30.06.2008 and the same was not reimbursed. Welspun/MSK was
required to take steps for escalating the disputes within the period of
limitation. It is apparent that no such dispute was escalated to the Chief
Executives of the parties within a period of three years from the date
when the cause of action for claiming such reimbursement had arisen.
The impugned award warrants no interference to the extent it rejects the
said claim.
102. In view of the above, the impugned award to the extent it holds
that Welspun’s Claim nos. I, II and III, as included in the Final Bill, are
barred by limitation, is set aside. Accordingly, denial of other claims,
which are premised on the said findings including claim for interest and
costs, cannot be sustained as well. The impugned award to the extent it
denies the said claims is set aside. The impugned order is also set aside.
103.    It is clarified that the claimant is entitled to take steps for
reference of the disputes to arbitration afresh.
104. The appeal is, accordingly, allowed in the aforesaid terms.
Pending applications, if any, are also disposed of.
105. The parties to bear their own costs.
