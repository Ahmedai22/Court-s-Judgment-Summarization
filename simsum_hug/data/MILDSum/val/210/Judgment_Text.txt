1. Four residents of Jagatsinghpur District have filed this Public
Interest Litigation (PIL), complaining of a large number of
irregularities committed in the appointment of Teachers for
Primary Schools pursuant to a Resolution dated 12th March, 1996
of the School and Mass Education Department (S&ME),
Government of Odisha. In particular, it is alleged that the merit
list of eligible Teachers for appointment as Primary Teachers in
Jagatsinghpur included less meritorious candidates by-passing
those who had secured more marks in the selection process.
W.P.(C) No.1966 of 2017                                 Page 1 of 6
2. It is stated that on its own, the S&ME Department realized its
mistake and published a revised selection list in 2006. The
Petitioners stated that this list too has numerous persons whose
appointments are vitiated for having secured less marks than those
overlooked and further that some of them have produced fake
3. The immediate provocation for the present petition appears to
be an order dated 13th July, 2015 of the S&ME Department
allowing such persons to have the benefit of the Revised Assured
Career Progression (RACP) Scheme. It is alleged that the
Government has tried to regularize the services of some of these
illegally appointed Teachers and, therefore, the Court should
interfere and direct the Opposite Parties “to take immediate steps
to remove the disqualified Primary School Teachers from
Jagatsinghpur Education District”. The further prayer is that a
CBI enquiry should be directed.
4. On 18th April, 2017 when this petition was first listed for
hearing, the following order was passed:
“This writ petition has been filed in the nature of a
Public Interest Litigation by four petitioners with the
primary prayer for a direction to the opposite parties
to take immediate steps to remove the disqualified
Primary School Teachers appointed in different
Primary Schools of Jagatsinghpur district from their
respective posts. One of such teachers has been
arrayed as opposite party No.9, whereas the prayer
made in the writ petition that a large number of such
teachers who have been appointed, are not qualified.
W.P.(C) No.1966 of 2017                                   Page 2 of 6
Firstly, it is not known from perusal of the writ
petition as to who the petitioners are, as nothing has
been stated in the petition with regard to locus of the
petitioners. Secondly, since the matter relates to
service of teachers, the writ petition in the nature of
Public Interest Litigation would not be maintainable.
Thirdly, the selection is said to have been made from
the select list of the year 1997. The petitioners have
challenged the same after 2 decades in 2017.
At this stage, learned counsel for the petitioner prays
for an adjournment.
5. When the petition was listed next five years later on 26th April,
2022, Mr. Ramakanta Sarangi, learned counsel appearing for the
Petitioners, prayed for some more time to address the issues raised
in the above order. Today, in the course of his submissions, Mr.
Sarangi has placed reliance on the decision in Central Electricity
Supply Utility of Odisha v. Dhobei Sahoo AIR 2014 SC 246 to
urge that while the general rule is that in service matters, PIL will
not be entertained, the exception is where a writ of quo warranto
was being sought to quash the illegal appointments.
6. On the other hand, Mr. B.A. Prusty, learned Standing Counsel
for the S&ME Department, places reliance on the decision in
Girjesh Shrivastava v. State of Madhya Pradesh (2010) 10 SCC
7. There can be no doubt that in the present case, the reliefs
sought by the present Petitioners are in the realm of service law
W.P.(C) No.1966 of 2017                                   Page 3 of 6
since the prayers concern the legality of the employment of
several Primary School teachers in Jagatsinghpur pursuant to a
process that began nearly three decades ago in 1996. The present
Petitioners did not participate in the said selection. The select list
was published some time in 2006 and appointments were made.
Yet, the Petitioners chose to wait for over 11 years to file this
petition challenging the appointments.
8. In Girjesh Shrivastava (supra), the Supreme Court was dealing
with an appeal from the decision of the Madhya Pradesh High
Court in two PILs alleging contravention of the Madhya Pradesh
Panchayat Contractual Teachers (Conditions of Appointment and
Services) Rules, 2001 (2001 Rules) in the appointment of such
teachers. The ground for challenge was that no reservations had
been made for Ex-Servicemen and further the Members of the
Selection Committee had their near relatives appearing as
candidates in the selection. The Supreme Court referred to its
earlier decisions in Dr. Duryodhan Sahoo v. Jitendra Kumar
Mishra (1998) 7 SCC 273, B. Srinivasa Reddy v. Karnataka
(2006) 11 SCC 731 and Dattaraj Nathuji Thaware v. State of
Maharashtra (2005) 1 SCC 590, which had categorically held
that PIL in service matters should not be entertained. In Girjesh
Shrivastava (supra), the above principle was reiterated and the
order of the High Court interfering in the PILs was set aside.
W.P.(C) No.1966 of 2017                                   Page 4 of 6
9. For that matter, even in Central Electricity Supply Utility of
Odisha v. Dhobei Sahoo (supra), which has been relied upon by
Mr. Sarangi, the Supreme Court actually allowed the appeal of the
CESU and set aside the order of the High Court interfering in a
PIL on the alleged plea of disqualification of the incumbent and
issuing a writ of quo warranto. The order of the High Court was
in fact quashed.
10. There is no issue of quo warranto involved in the present
case. The prayers, in fact, do not even mention the word ‘quo
warranto’. This Court is therefore not prepared to view the
present PIL as one seeking a writ of quo warranto.
11. Secondly, only one private individual, who was allegedly
disqualified for being appointed as a primary school teacher, has
been impleaded as Opposite Party No.9. Although several names
have been mentioned in Para-4 of the writ petition, the others
have not been made as Opposite Parties. There is no convincing
explanation given for this.
12. Further, as already noted, there is an inordinate delay in the
Petitioners approaching this Court against the so-called illegal
appointments. The selection took place in 1996, a revised
selection list was published in 2006 and yet the present writ
petition was filed only on 2nd February, 2017. The Petitioners
have not offered any convincing explanation for the inordinate
W.P.(C) No.1966 of 2017                                 Page 5 of 6
delay of nearly 11 years in approaching the Court to challenge the
said appointments made way back in 2006.
13. Mr. B.A. Prusty, learned Standing Counsel for the S&ME
Department, states that the Government is already seized of the
issue concerning teachers being appointed on the basis of fake
certificates and concerted efforts are being made to tackle the
problem.
14. For all of the aforementioned reasons, the Court is not
prepared to entertain this present writ petition as a PIL and it is
dismissed as such, but in the circumstances with no orders as to
costs.
