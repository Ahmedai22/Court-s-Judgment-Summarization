1.      This petition has been filed under Section 34 of the Arbitration
and Conciliation Act, 1996 (“Act of 1996”, hereinafter) challenging
the order dated February 18, 2022 passed by the Arbitral Tribunal
rejecting  the    application   of    the  petitioner      herein  seeking
O.M.P. (COMM) 275/2022                                          Page 1 of 39
2.       The petitioner, NTPC Limited, is a wholly owned company of
the Government of India, registered under the Companies Act, 1956.
The respondent No. 1, Larsen and Toubro („L&T‟, for short) and
respondent No.2, Alpine Mayreder Bau GmbH („Alpine‟, for short),
are the constituents of a Joint Venture („JV‟, for short), which was
awarded a contract, pursuant to which an agreement dated January 19,
2007 was entered into, with the said JV on the first part and the
petitioner on the second part.
3.       Owing to certain disputes amongst the parties, an Arbitral
Tribunal consisting of three members was constituted. Respondent
No.1 submitted its Statement of Claims before the Tribunal, arraying
the petitioner and respondent No. 2 herein as respondent Nos. 1 and 2
respectively. On January 09, 2014, the petitioner terminated the
agreement dated January 19, 2007, invoking clause 63 therein, citing
failure on part of the respondent No. 1 in discharging its contractual
obligations.
4.       Accordingly,    the   respondent   No.l/claimant    sought     an
amendment in its Statement of Claims, challenging the said
termination dated January 09, 2014, though as a consequence of the
initial prayer. The amendment application was allowed and the
amended Statement of Claims dated December 01, 2014 was taken on
record. The petitioner herein filed its reply to the amended Statement
of Claims of the respondent No. l. The Statement of Defence and
counter-claims were filed by the petitioner on January 14, 2016,
comprising of 12 claims, while reserving its right to revise/raise further
O.M.P. (COMM) 275/2022                                        Page 2 of 39
claims    as   and    when   the   situation   arises. An    amount     of
₹386,61,81,750/- calculated up to September 30, 2015 on estimation
basis was claimed by the petitioner towards counter-claim No. 1, i.e.,
Claim towards Risk and Cost.
5.      The contract for the remaining work was awarded by the
petitioner to a company namely M/s HCC Limited („HCC‟,
hereinafter) at the risk and cost of the JV. In terms of the directions of
the Tribunal dated April 21, 2017, all contractual documents pertaining
to the contract awarded to HCC were placed on record on May 27,
2017. Thereafter, the respondent No.1 filed evidence by way of
affidavit of its witness CW -3, which mentions exhaustively the BOQ
items/ rate, technical specifications, provisions etc. of the contractual
documents of HCC. It is stated that the respondent No.1 was very
much aware of the contents of the contractual documents of HCC and
they had nothing to add as its defence for rebuttal of the amount as
sought to be updated under Counter Claim No. 1.
6.      It is the case of the petitioner that the contract value of the
balance work to be executed at the risk and cost of the respondent No.
1 stands amended to ₹651,66,32,773.57 vide amendment dated January
01, 2021, which was issued in variation of BOQ items having financial
implications. With the addition of departmental overheads @10% of
the awarded value of the remaining work, the risk and cost amount as
on May 31, 2021 comes to ₹4,96,76,31,821/-.
7.      Details of the counter-claims of the petitioner with the amount
revised up to May 31, 2021 as provided by the petitioner is reproduced
O.M.P. (COMM) 275/2022                                        Page 3 of 39
against Liquidated Damage
for premium paid against CAR

O.M.P. (COMM) 275/2022                                  Page 4 of 39
8.       It is the case of the petitioner that claim Nos. 1, 7 and 9 have
not crystallised and as such it reserved its right to raise further claims
as and when the occasion arises. The petitioner then moved an
application on July 24, 2021 before the Tribunal seeking permission to
place the amount revised/updated for counter-claims Nos. 1, 3, 4, 7, 8,
9 and 12. An application under Order II Rule 2 of the Code of Civil
Procedure, 1908 (CPC) was also moved by the petitioner seeking leave
to raise the claims as and when the situation arises. The respondent No.
l filed its reply to the said application. No rejoinder thereto was
allowed to be filed. After hearing the arguments of both the parties on
the said application, the Tribunal made the impugned decision dated
February 18, 2022, rejecting the application filed by the petitioner
holding that the same is filed belatedly. The Tribunal vide the
impugned order also granted liberty to the petitioner to invoke fresh
arbitration if permissible under the contract, with regard to the updated
claims. One of the Ld. Arbitrators dissented with the decision, and
allowed the application of the petitioner.
9.       Ms. Maninder Acharya, learned Senior Counsel appearing for
the petitioner submitted that the Arbitral Tribunal exceeded its
jurisdiction by not adhering to Clauses 63.1, 63.2 and 63.3 of the
O.M.P. (COMM) 275/2022                                         Page 5 of 39
Contract Agreement, which on their conjoint reading make it amply
clear that both the parties are ad idem that the cause of action which
has arisen at the time of termination, would persist till the expiry of
three years from the date of completion of the defect liability period.
The Tribunal ought to have seen that it is an admitted fact that the
contractual work in terms of the Contract Agreement dated January 19,
2007 which was terminated at the risk and cost of JV, is still not
complete and the amount for counter claim Nos. l, 7 and 9 which is to
be recovered from the respondent No.l in terms of contractual
provisions, is yet to be crystallised, and therefore the cause of action
for recovery which arose with the termination of the contract is still
continuing.
10.     It is the case of the petitioner, as has emerged from the grounds
of the petition, that the Tribunal has erred in holding that the updation
application filed by the petitioner is in fact an application for
amendment of substantive pleadings in respect of the counter-claims.
According to the petitioner, the application is seeking „updation /
revision‟ and not amendment.
11.     She stated that the impugned order is illegal and contrary to
law inasmuch as the Tribunal has exceeded its jurisdiction by rejecting
the updation application on the ground of limitation, which is a mixed
question of fact and law, and could not be decided at this stage.
12.     The petitioner sought updation/ revision of the counter-claims
No. 1,3,4,7,8, 9 and 12 respectively by moving an application without
changing the pleading or the cause of action. The necessity arose for
the reason that out of the total 12 counter-claims, the amount of the
O.M.P. (COMM) 275/2022                                         Page 6 of 39
aforesaid counter-claims, with the passage of time, except claim no.
12, has enhanced. The updation is formal in nature which does not
change the nature of the case. The counter-claims were filed before
the Tribunal with the amount of claim calculated up to September 30,
2015 along with the Statement of Defence on January 14, 2016 after
the contract was terminated on January 09, 2014, admittedly well
within the stipulated time. Liberty was reserved by the petitioner to
add, modify or supplement the same as and when the situation arises.
Counter claim No. 1 is for recovery against risk and cost which was
claimed initially for a sum of ₹386,61,81,750/- up to September 30,
2015 which comes to ₹496,76,31,821/- on calculation up to May 3l,
202l. The last amendment was issued on January 01, 2021 with the
revised contractual value up to ₹651,66,32,773/- which after adding the
departmental overheads and the value of work done and deduction of
value of the remaining work comes to ₹496,64,87,863/-. Counter claim
No. 3 is for recovery of the premium paid against car policy/insurance
which gets enhanced because of the insurance premiums borne by the
petitioner beyond September 30, 2015 till award of the remaining
works. So is the case with counter claim No. 4 which is for expenditure
incurred towards dewatering and other essential services of HRT like
lighting, ventilation, D.G. sets etc. for the period beyond September
30, 2015 till award of the remaining works. Counter claim No. 8 also
stands on the same footing, wherein; the petitioner has sought the
recovery of revenue loss caused by the delay in commissioning of the
project due to non-completion of the work by the JV. Counter claim
No. 9 is for recovery of interest on outstanding advances and claim
O.M.P. (COMM) 275/2022                                      Page 7 of 39
amounts which is bound to be enhanced for the reason that the interest
can be levied on the outstanding advances which is still lying with the
JV. However, the amount towards royalty charges, workers‟ cess and
other statutory compliances get reduced for the reason that the same is
paid regularly. According to her, disallowing the application seeking
updation/revision has left no scope for the petitioner to get the said
upgraded/revised amount adjudicated in any forum.
13.     Ms. Acharya submitted that the liberty granted to the petitioner
by the Tribunal to raise a fresh arbitral proceeding is merely illusory
for multiple reasons. Firstly, the said application has been rejected on
the ground of delay as mentioned in Section 23 of the Act of 1996 in
ignorance of specific clauses 63.1, 63.2 and 63.3 of the Contract
Agreement which fix the timeline for the cause of action. Secondly, the
amount which is sought to be updated has come into existence during
the continuation of the present arbitration proceedings. Thirdly, a new
Tribunal, if constituted for adjudication of the present updated amount,
will certainly be influenced by the ground of delay stated by the
present Tribunal for rejection of the application, leaving the petitioner
which is a public sector undertaking, remediless. The ground of delay,
in case the impugned order is sustained, will be available to the
respondent No.1 which would come in the way of the petitioner if a
fresh arbitration with respect to the said updated/revised amount of
counter-claims, is initiated. In other words, the rejection of the
application by the Tribunal entitles the respondent No.1 to take up a
ground of limitation as and when the adjudication of the
updated/revised claims is sought before any of the forum. Thus, a huge
O.M.P. (COMM) 275/2022                                        Page 8 of 39
sum of public money would remain un-adjudicated and the petitioner
will be deprived of the same. According to her, this manifests that the
rejection of the application seeking updation/ revision of the amount of
counter-claims has decided the lis finally without considering the same
on merit. In fact, the arbitral proceedings qua the said claims sought to
be updated gets terminated with the rejection of the application of the
petitioner in terms of Section 32 of the Act of 1996 inasmuch as this is
the final settlement of the disputes qua those updated/revised claims.
Substantive rights of the petitioner have been decided by the Tribunal
which means that the petitioner cannot in future claim the relief as they
have sought for by way of the application seeking updation/ revision.
14.     Further, it is stated that the Tribunal, while disposing of the
application, has decided finally the issue of updation with respect to
the amount sought to be revised and therefore, the impugned order has
the trappings of finality / final determination of the controversies
before the Tribunal. As such, the impugned order is an interim award
in terms of Section 2(c) and Section 31(6) of the Act of 1996, and
therefore, the petition under Section 34 of the Act of 1996 is
maintainable. Regarding the scope of an interim award under the Act,
she has referred to the decision of the Supreme Court in Farmers
Fertiliser Co-operative Limited v. Bhadra Products, 2018 (1) Arb. LR
271 (SC), wherein it was observed as under:-
"The language of Section 31 (6) is advisedly wide in
nature. A reading of the said sub-section makes it clear
that the jurisdiction to make an interim arbitral award is
left to the good sense of the arbitral tribunal, and that it
extends to "any matter" with respect to which it may
O.M.P. (COMM) 275/2022                                          Page 9 of 39
make a final arbitral award. The expression "matter" is
wide in nature, and subsumes issues at which the parties
are in dispute. It is clear, therefore, that any point of
dispute between the parties which has to be answered by
the arbitral tribunal can be the subject matter of an
interim arbitral award."
15.     She has also referred to the judgment in Cinevistaas v. Prasar
Bharti, 2019 SCC OnLine Del 7071, wherein this Court while
referring to Farmers Fertilizer Co-operative Limited (supra) and also
the judgment in Shah Babulal Khimji v. Jayaben D Kania, (1981) 4
SCC 8, set aside the order of an Arbitral Tribunal rejecting an
application seeking amendment on the ground of delay, holding as
"The rejection of the additional claims has in fact
resulted in greater delay rather than expeditious
disposal. The bona fides of the Petitioner are not in
question. Rejection of additional claims by the impugned
order have all the trappings of an award and hence the
Section 34 petition is clearly maintainable. On the basis
of the tests laid down in Shah Babulal Khimji (supra),
the rejection of the application to add or expand the
amounts claimed under certain heads results in a
conclusive determination that the said claims cannot be
adjudicated. Thus, there is not just formal adjudication
but in fact a final rejection of the said claims. This
constitutes a dismissal of the claims and hence would
constitute an award within the meaning of Section 2
(1)(c) of the Act."
16.     Reliance is also placed on Lt. Col. H.S. Bedi (Retd) and Anr.
v. STCI Finance Limited, OMP(COMM.) 546/2020 wherein the
following was observed:-
“In the judgment in the case of Cinevistaas Ltd. (supra)
on which reliance was placed by Mr. Vachher, in
paragraph 35, which I have already reproduced above,
the Coordinate Bench has held that as long as the
disputes fall broadly within the reference, correction
and amendment ought to be permitted as the principles
as laid down by the Supreme Court in Shah Babulal
Khimji v. Jayaben D. Kania, (1981) 4 SCC 8, would
have a greater application in arbitral proceedings as the
said judgment lays down principles that the substantive
rights affected ought to be seen, while determining what
kind of orders are challengable.”
17.      Ms. Acharya has submitted that the rejection of the application
of the petitioner solely on the ground of delay under Section 23(3) of
the Act of 1996, ignoring the specifically agreed clauses 63.1, 63.2 and
63.3 of the Contract Agreement, is patently illegal and unsustainable.
Cause of action which arose with the termination of the contract is still
continuing and would expire 3 years after the completion of the work.
There is no delay in seeking updation/ revision of the counter-claims in
view of the fact that the counter-claims are within the period of
limitation. The work awarded under the contract to the JV on
November 28, 2006 is still being carried out though another agency i.e.
HCC, which got the contract at the risk and cost of the JV. In view of
continuance of the work and non- completion thereof, the cause of
action for the counter claim No.1 and other counter-claims against the
JV is still continuing, which otherwise arose when the contract with the
JV was terminated on January 09, 2014. Though the revision/ updation
is within time as no timeline is fixed for the same, on a conjoint
reading of clauses 63.1,63.2 and 63.3 of the Contract Agreement, it is
O.M.P. (COMM) 275/2022                                        Page 11 of 39
amply clear that both the parties are ad idem that the cause of action,
would expire only three years after the completion of the defect
liability period. In other words, the petitioner gets the right to make a
claim against the JV even after the expiration of the defect liability
period and till the expiry of three years thereafter. In terms of clauses
63.1 and 63.3 of the Contract Agreement, the JV is not discharged
from its obligations and liabilities with the award of the contract to
HCC. It is her contention that HCC has stepped into the shoes of the
JV and therefore, the JV is liable to fulfill all its obligations and
liabilities until expiry of the defect liability period in terms of the
provisions of the contract signed between the JV and the petitioner.
She has referred to the judgment in Indian Oil Corporation Ltd. v.
hereinafter), wherein the Supreme Court in a petition filed under
Section 11 of the Act of 1996 dealt with the similar clauses and after
exhaustive deliberation has held that the cause of action for a claim
would start after the work is completed if the work is awarded to a new
contractor at the risk and cost of the earlier one. Further reliance is
placed on the decision of this Court in a petition under Section 34 of
the Act of 1996 titled Indian Oil Corporation Ltd v. SPS Engineering
hereinafter).
18.       She has also relied upon the judgment of the Supreme Court in
A.K. Gupta and Sons v. Damodar Valley Corporation, (1996) 1 SCR
796 to contend that where the amendment does not constitute an
addition to the facts already on record, the amendment would be
O.M.P. (COMM) 275/2022                                         Page 12 of 39
allowed even after the statutory period of limitation, and the judgment
of the High Court of Kerala in K.K. Scaria v. N, Mohandas and Ors.,
2015 SCC OnLine Ker 1632 to contend that the discussion to allow
amendment is considerably wide under Section 23(3) of the Act of
1996 and is not circumscribed as in the case of a suit by the provisions
of the CPC.
19.      According to her the impugned decision is patently illegal, as
per the principles laid down by the Supreme Court in the cases of
Indian Oil Corporation Limited v. Shree Ganesh Petroleum
Rajgurunagar, (2022) 4 SCC 463; Associate Builders vs. DDA (2015)
3 SCC 49; and Ssangyong Engineering and Construction Company
Ltd. v. National Highway Authority of India (NHAl) (2019) 15 SCC
20.      That apart, it is her argument that no prejudice is caused to the
respondent No. 1 in case the application is allowed, for the reason that
the JV had itself agreed vide clause 63.1 of the Contract Agreement,
that the petitioner shall be authorised to terminate the contract and to
complete the work either by itself or through any other contractor at
the risk and cost of the JV.
21.      She has also relied upon the judgments in Dhannalal v.
Kalawati Bai (2002) 6 SCC 16; and Gammon India Ltd. v. National
Highways Authority of India, AIR (2020) DEL 132, to argue that the
rejection of the application and the liberty granted by the Tribunal to
the petitioner to initiate fresh arbitration would lead to multiplicity of
litigation, which is contrary to the basic intent of the Act of 1996,
which contemplates a fundamental principle that an Arbitral Tribunal
O.M.P. (COMM) 275/2022                                         Page 13 of 39
shall adjudicate all disputes in one and the same proceeding.
22.      Mr. Rajeev Virmani, learned Senior Counsel appearing for the
respondent No. 1 would state at the outset that the present petition is
ex-facie not maintainable as the impugned order is neither an award
nor an interim award in terms of Section 2(1)(c) read with Section 31
(6) of the Act of 1996. There is no final determination of the claims
sought to be raised by the petitioner by its application. The impugned
order merely disallows the petitioner to amend the counter-claims,
leaving it open to the petitioner to raise the same in fresh arbitration, if
permissible under law. A petition under Section 34 of the Act of 1996
is maintainable only against an award defined under 2(1)(c) read with
23.      According to him, an order accepting or dismissing an
application seeking amendment of pleadings under Section 23(3) of the
Act of 1996 cannot be termed as an interim award, if it has not decided
the issue finally so as to allow challenging such order under Section
34. The impugned order lacks the feature of finality. Pertinently, in the
impugned order, the Tribunal has expressly noted at paragraph 7.1 of
the impugned order that "nothing in the Order shall be construed as a
final determination on merits of the case for any issue touched upon or
decided by this Order.”. Further, in paragraph 7.2 of the order, the
Tribunal has left it open for the petitioner to invoke fresh arbitration
with regard to the claims made in the application seeking amendment
of the counter-claims. Furthermore, the impugned order does not
record any finding on any of the issues raised before the Tribunal in
the arbitration proceedings between the parties. Therefore, the twin
O.M.P. (COMM) 275/2022                                         Page 14 of 39
test of issue and finality are not met so as to term the impugned order
as an award or an interim award under the Act of 1996. Therefore, it is
sufficiently clear that the Tribunal has made no final determination on
the controversies before it, and as such the impugned order is not
amenable to challenge before this Court under Section 34 of the Act of
24.      That apart, the impugned order records no finding that the
claims sought to be brought in by the petitioner by way of amendment
in the counter-claims are barred by limitation as has been wrongly
suggested in the petition. Rather the Tribunal has expressly refrained
from going into the issue of limitation as is evident from paragraph
7.20 of the impugned order, which reads as under:-
"The Tribunal therefore rejects the Updation Application
filed by the Respondent No.1. The Tribunal does not
consider it necessary to dwell upon the other arguments
raised by the Claimant, including the issue of limitation and
waiver, and dismisses the application on the ground of delay
and prejudice alone. "
25.      He stated that the petitioner moved the amendment application
after a considerable delay of nearly 5.5 years at a stage when both the
parties had already led their evidence and concluded their final
arguments. Considering the status of the arbitration proceedings
allowing the amendment application would cause grave prejudice to
the respondent No.1. It is for this reason that the Tribunal considered
it inappropriate to allow the application. In the present facts, if the
petitioner is allowed to challenge the impugned order, the same would
be tantamount to condonation of the gross delay which has been
O.M.P. (COMM) 275/2022                                       Page 15 of 39
committed by the petitioner willfully without any just and sufficient
cause explaining the delay.
26.      In support of his contentions, he has referred to the judgments
of this Court in the following cases:
1. Container Corporation of India v. Texmaco, (2009) SCC
2. VIL Rohtak v. NHAI, OMP (COMM) 339/2021
27.      Further, it is stated that the Tribunal has dismissed the
petitioner's application by exercising its discretion under Section 23(3)
of the Act of 1996 while considering the gross delay on part of the
petitioner. As such, the discretion exercised by the Tribunal is not
amenable to judicial review, much less in a petition under Section 34
of the Act of 1996.
28.      Yet another submission of Mr. Virmani is that the application
seeking amendment of the counter-claims has been rejected taking into
account the delay on the part of the petitioner. The impugned order
does not reject the claims sought to be introduced in the counter-claims
at all much less on the ground that these would be barred by limitation.
He contended that limitation is statutorily recognized as a bar to a suit
or a claim by virtue of Section 3 of the Limitation Act, 1963 read with
Section 43 (1). On the other hand, delay, in the context of Section 23
(3) of the Act of 1996 precludes the parties from amending its
pleadings during the course of arbitral proceedings without affecting
the rights and contentions of either party on maintainability of new
claims / counter-claims in the subsequent proceedings. Thus, there is a
O.M.P. (COMM) 275/2022                                        Page 16 of 39
clear distinction between a claim being barred by limitation and its
consequent rejection, and an application of amendment being
disallowed by the Tribunal considering it inappropriate on the
threshold of delay in making it and the prejudice that it would cause.
To demonstrate the distinction between delay and limitation, Mr.
Virmani has relied upon the Judgment of the Supreme Court in the
matter of P Daivasigamani v. S. Sambandan, Civil Appeal No.
29.      He has relied upon the table provided in paragraph C of his
written submissions to contend that the petitioner failed to provide any
justification or cause for not filing the application for amendment of its
counter-claims for nearly 5½ years after the contract was awarded to
HCC Limited. He stated that though the petitioner had put forth a
ground in its petition that there is no delay, during the course of
hearing, the learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that due to the
petitioner company‟s officers being on COVID-19 duty it could not
file the said application at an earlier stage. However, there was no
COVID-19 in 2016, when HCC was awarded the contract, and
COVID-19 did not deter the petitioner from leading its evidence and
addressing final arguments.
30.      Mr. Virmani has also sought to controvert the submission of
Mr. Acharya that the application was not seeking amendment, but was
only for updation.      If the petitioner‟s application was merely for
updation as contended that the same would not be maintainable as
there is no provision in the Act of 1996 conferring jurisdiction upon
the Tribunal for accepting anything beyond the pleadings for
O.M.P. (COMM) 275/2022                                         Page 17 of 39
adjudication. As per Section 23 (1) of the Act any claimant or counter-
claimant is mandatorily required to state all the facts supporting its
claims / counter-claims, the points at issue and the relief sought. Any
digression from the original claims / counter-claims under Section 23
(1) of the Act can be entertained by the Tribunal only if it satisfies the
criteria for amendment laid down in Section 23 (3) of the Act and not
by way of any updation. It is to avoid the applicability of the provision
of Section 23 (3) and to avoid providing any explanation for delay and
prejudice, that the petitioner has mischievously termed its amendment
application as an updation application. The application itself reveals
that it was for amendment as would be clear from paragraph 1 therein
whereby the petitioner has sought a „revision‟ of the counter-claims
and also from the prayer in the application whereby the petitioner has
sought adjudication on the revised claims. Mr. Virmani submitted that
„revise‟ is defined in Black‟s Law Dictionary inter alia to mean „to go
over a thing for the purpose of amending‟. Similarly, „amend‟ is
defined to inter alia mean „revise‟. He further stated that the
application was nothing but clever drafting to create illusions to avoid
the scrutiny under Section 23 (3) of the Act. Such actions of clever
drafting creating illusions in the absence of real grounds have been
frowned upon by Courts as a means resorted to abuse the process of
law. Reference in this regard is made to the judgments of the Supreme
Court in the cases of T. Aravindandam v. T. V. Satyapal, (1977) 4
SCC 467 and ITC Ltd. v. Debt Recovery Appellate Tribunal, (1998) 2
31.      In the initial counter-claim the petitioner specifically sought a
O.M.P. (COMM) 275/2022                                         Page 18 of 39
direction against the respondent No.1 to pay a specific amount of
₹3,150 crore. However in the amendment application the petitioner
sought permission to place on record the amount revised / updated for
counter-claim numbers 1, 3, 4, 7, 8, 9 and 12. Further it sought
adjudication of revised amount of ₹3,531 crore instead of ₹3,150 crore.
This could not have been possible without an amendment. That apart,
by way of the amendment application, the petitioner has also sought
amendment of various annexures to the counter-claims. This becomes
evident when annexure A-1 of the original counter-claim is juxtaposed
with annexure A-1 of the amendment application. While in the former,
the claimed sum is of ₹5,51,60,00,000/- towards estimated value of
balance work to be executed at the risk and cost of the JV. However,
in the latter, this counter claim has increased to ₹6,51,66,32,774/-.
Further in the amendment application, the petitioner has relied on a
new annexure being annexure R-26, referable to the HCC Contract, for
the first time to arrive at this figure, though no mention of this
annexure was made in Annexure A-1 of the original counter-claims.
Similarly, the petitioner in the amendment application has introduced
for the first time item no. 6 and annexure R-27,even though the same
were absent in Annexure A-1 to the original counter-claims. As a
result, total amount of ₹3,86,61,81,750/- as per Annexure A-1 of the
original counter-claims has increased to ₹4,96,76,31,821 in Annexure
A-1 of the amendment application.       The Tribunal after perusing the
petitioner‟s application arrived at a conclusion that the amendment
sought by the petitioner with respect to counter-claim no.1 changes the
very nature of the counter-claim. It is for the first time that the basis
O.M.P. (COMM) 275/2022                                       Page 19 of 39
of the counter-claim no. 1 that is claim for recovery against risk and
cost was sought to be changed from that of mere „estimate‟ by
specifically linking it to the HCC contract. That apart, he contended
that mere averment in the counter-claims that a party would reserve its
rights to amend its pleadings would not confer any unfettered right to
amend. Any amendment would have to be in accordance with law.
32.      That apart, the Tribunal in its order dated November 03, 2016,
i.e., almost 8 months after the award of the contract to HCC, has
recorded that the pleadings are complete and both the parties have
agreed that no further amendment of the pleadings required. The
petitioner is estopped from seeking any amendment or asserting any
increased counter claim, as the statement of the parties before the
Tribunal is an express waiver of any such right.
33.      As for the reliance placed by Ms. Acharya on the Judgment in
Cinevistaas (supra), he contended that the issue therein was that of
amendment and not of any updation. The petitioner cannot approbate
and reprobate by stating on one hand that its application is merely
seeking updation, not amendment, and on the other hand rely upon
judgments that deal with amendment of pleadings.
34.      He has also stated that the recourse to amendment under
Section 23 (3) of the Act was not available in view of the agreement
between the parties not to amend. The Tribunal on November 3, 2016
framed the point for determination wherein both parties agreed that no
further amendment of pleadings will be required. This would bar any
amendment in view of the opening words of Section 23 (3), i.e.,
„Unless otherwise agreed by the parties…”. It is for this reason that
O.M.P. (COMM) 275/2022                                       Page 20 of 39
the petitioner has termed its application as updation application and not
amendment application.
35.      He also submitted that the statement of the petitioner that the
entire HCC contract was on record is false. The Tribunal vide order
dated April 21, 2017 directed the petitioner to place on record the
contract dated April 21, 2016 executed with HCC.            However, as
brought out in the amendment application, HCC contract was amended
11 times from September 1, 2017 to June 15, 2020.                  These
amendments were never brought on record in the arbitration
proceedings as is clear from Annexure R-26 to the petition.
36.      It is his contention that the Tribunal rightly held that the
application did not pass the threshold prescribed under Section 23 (3),
i.e., with regard to appropriateness, delay and resultant prejudice that
will be caused to the opposite party in allowing amendment.          That
apart, as the HCC contract was sought to be introduced for the first
time by way of an amendment application, the application, if allowed,
would require arbitration proceedings to start afresh from the state of
pleadings and will also require leading additional evidence by the
respondent No.1. This would result in making the final hearings which
have taken place since January, 2021 redundant, causing grave
prejudice to the respondent No.1 by delaying the process of
adjudication of its claims.       Therefore, allowing the amendment
application would defeat the purpose of speedy resolution by
arbitration.
37.      That apart, he also stated that the submission of the petitioner
on multiplicity of proceedings to claim amendment is misconceived, as
O.M.P. (COMM) 275/2022                                        Page 21 of 39
the present arbitration is the third arbitral reference in respect of the
same contract which are separated by difference stages and timelines in
the performance of the contract. The first claim / reference pertains to
the period starting from November, 2006 to October 31, 2009 and is at
the stage of enforcement of the arbitral award. The second claim /
reference pertain to the period starting from November, 2009 to April
30, 2012 wherein arbitration proceedings have been concluded and the
Tribunal therein has reserved its final award. The third claim /
reference, that is an arbitration wherefrom the present issue arises,
pertains to disputes arising between the parties from May 1, 2012 to
December 1, 2014, i.e., the date on which the amendment Statement of
Claims was filed before the Tribunal by the respondent No.1. It is the
petitioner‟s own case that the proposed amendments were not the only
ones, and it would initiate fresh arbitration once the contract given to
HCC is completed. This means the petitioner itself has no intention
whatsoever of avoiding multiplicity of proceedings.
38.       Mr. Virmani has further stated that even assuming arguendo
that the impugned order is an award / interim award, no grounds under
Section 34 of the Act of 1996 is shown to exist to warrant interference
with the same. The decision of the Tribunal cannot be faulted on the
limited parameters of Section 34 and the petitioner has failed to show
that there is any perversity or patent illegality in the order. He stated
that it is well settled that a Court exercising jurisdiction under Section
34 does not sit in appeal over the awards passed by the Tribunal and its
jurisdiction is limited to examining the impugned awards on the
grounds mentioned thereunder. Further, it is submitted that while
O.M.P. (COMM) 275/2022                                         Page 22 of 39
considering a petition under Section 34 of the Act of 1996, the Court
may pass interim orders as circumscribed by Section 36 (2) and (3) of
the Act only. It is beyond the jurisdiction of Section 34 and Section 36
of the Act that while considering a petition under Section 34, in the
interim, any interference is made with the arbitral proceedings. The
Court at the stage of admission of a petition under Section 34 ought not
to interfere or interdict the underlying arbitral proceedings in any
manner since the scope of interim order in a petition under Section 34
can only be in the nature of orders as contemplated under Section 36
(2) and (3) of the Act. To buttress his argument, he has relied upon the
judgments of the Supreme Court in the following cases:
1. Ssangyong Engineering and Construction Co. Ltd.
3. Project Director, National Highways, No. 45E and
220, NHAI v. M. Hakeem and Anr. (2021) 9 SCC 1
39.     Further, it is his case that the judgment of the Supreme Court
in Indian Oil Corporation Ltd.-I (supra) is distinguishable on the facts
of this case. In that case, the first award rejected the claim of the
employer, which was premised on risk and cost. Thereafter second
reference was declined by the Court under Section 11 on the ground of
res judicata.     The Supreme Court held that the designate Court
wrongly arrived at a conclusion that the claim of the employer therein
was barred by res judicata. However, the said order of the Supreme
Court was not on merits and therefore cannot be binding precedent as
is being sought to be read by the petitioner. In the present case, the
O.M.P. (COMM) 275/2022                                       Page 23 of 39
counter-claims are not being rejected on merits. In any case, the
judgments of both the Supreme Court and this Court in Indian Oil
Corporation Limited-I and II (supra) would be applicable only when
the petitioner demonstrates that the discharge of the respondent No. 1
was invalid and after cost of completion of the remaining contractual
work has crystallised. Therefore, the judgment cannot be interpreted as
permitting a belated amendment to be allowed.
40.      That apart, he stated that the amendment relating to costs and
interest has been disallowed by the Tribunal as it is in any way within
the jurisdiction of the Tribunal. The petitioner had prayed for award of
costs and pre and pendente lite interest on the amount sought in the
counter-claim. However, by way of amendment application its sought
to revise its counter-claims under these two categories of the original
counter-claim. These prayers in the amendment application to revise
the original counter-claims towards costs and interest were specifically
disallowed by the Tribunal under its power to award costs and interest
under Section 31-A and 31 (7) of the Act of 1996.             He has also
submitted without admitting the interpretation of Clause 63 of the
Contract Agreement, that the amendment having been disallowed on
the parameters laid down in Section 23 (3) of the Act of 1996, Section
63 of the contract has absolutely no bearing on the amendment sought
by the petitioner.
42.      Having heard the learned counsel for the parties and perused
the record, the first issue that needs to be decided is the maintainability
O.M.P. (COMM) 275/2022                                         Page 24 of 39
of this petition under Section 34 of the Act of 1996. This is primarily
for the reason, as contended by Mr. Virmani, that the impugned order
is neither an award nor an interim award in terms of Section 2(1) (c)
read with Section 31 (6) of the Act. He has qualified his submission
by stating that there is no final determination of the prayers sought to
be raised by the petitioner in its application. The impugned order
merely disallows the petitioner to amend its counter-claims, leaving it
open to the petitioner to raise the same in a fresh arbitration if
permissible under law.
43.      On the other hand, Ms. Acharya would contest this plea by
stating that the Tribunal concluded that the updation sought by way of
an application was after much delay of 5 years and the liberty granted
to seek fresh arbitration, shall be merely illusory.
44.      Before I consider the issue of maintainability of the petition, I
intend to deal with the issue whether the application filed by the
petitioner is only for updation / revision and not for amendment so as
to attract the provisions of Section 23 (3) of the Act of 1996. The
Tribunal has concluded that the application is in fact, for amendment
of the counter-claims for the reason that the amounts of the counter-
claims and even the methodology for calculating such amounts have
been changed. The Tribunal has also come to a conclusion that there is
no concept of updation of the claims/counter-claims provided in the
Act, and as such the changes sought to be made by the petitioner
necessarily has to be through amendment of their counter-claims.
45.      At this juncture, I may reproduce Section 23 (3) of the Act of
1996 which reads as under:
“(3) Unless otherwise agreed by the parties, either party
may amend or supplement his claim or defence during the
course of the arbitral proceedings, unless the arbitral
tribunal considers it inappropriate to allow the amendment
or supplement having regard to the delay in making it.”
46.     In substance, Section 23 (3) provides that if a party intends to
amend or supplement its claims or defence, the Tribunal can consider it
inappropriate to allow the same, having regard to the delay in making
it. As stated above, the plea of Ms. Acharya is that by the application,
the petitioner intended to update/revise the counter-claims. I am not
convinced by the submissions made by Ms. Acharya. The petitioner
by stating that the application is for updation/revision was primarily
seeking the amendment of the counter-claims. The purpose of the
petitioner seeking updation/revision is primarily to alter/change the
amounts of the counter-claims. In that sense, though the application
has been termed as updation application by the petitioner was in effect
for amendment.
47.     Mr. Virmani has contended that Black‟s Law Dictionary
defines “revise” as “to go over a thing for the purpose of amending”.
Similarly, “amend” is also defined to inter-alia mean “revise”. In that
sense also, updation/revision shall have the effect of amending the
counter-claims. In fact, I may note that while contending that
updation/revision is different from amendment, Ms. Acharya has relied
upon the judgments in Cinevistaas (supra) and Lt.Col. HS Bedi
(Retd.) (supra) which primarily relate to the issue of amendment. In
other words, she has relied upon judgments where amendments have
been allowed in favour of the parties therein, in support of her case that
O.M.P. (COMM) 275/2022                                        Page 26 of 39
the application is for mere updation/revision. Needless to state, a party
cannot be allowed to blow hot and cold. It is reiterated that the
Tribunal was right in holding that the application filed by the petitioner
was for seeking amendment of the counter-claims. If that be so, the
Tribunal was within its right in the given facts to not to allow the
application for updation / revision, which in effect was for amendment
of the counter-claims, on the ground that the same was made belatedly.
48.     Now that it is established that the application filed by the
petitioner before the Tribunal was in fact for amendment of its counter-
claims, I shall now answer the issue of maintainability of this petition
filed under Section 34 Act of 1996. I am unable to agree with the
submission made by Ms. Acharya for the simple reason that the
Tribunal has only refused to allow the updation / amendment of the
counter-claims primarily on the ground that updation / amendment has
been sought belatedly and in terms of Section 23 (3) of the Act of
1996, which contemplates that the amendment / supplement of claim /
defence can be refused on the ground of delay. That apart, the Tribunal
has also rejected the application on the ground of prejudice as the
proceedings are at the final arguments stage, that too of the petitioner
herein. Any updation / amendment of the counter-claims would require
fresh evidence to be considered, and shall result in proving the
documents to be relied upon by the petitioner, which shall further delay
the proceedings. It is necessary to state at this stage that the Tribunal
has also held that the documents relating to execution of the contract
with HCC would have to be taken on record and the respondent has to
be given an opportunity to accept or deny the documents. In this
O.M.P. (COMM) 275/2022                                        Page 27 of 39
regard, Ms. Acharya has contested the said finding by stating that the
contract executed by the petitioner with HCC has already been placed
on record.    In any case, meaningfully read the conclusion of the
Tribunal that as the present arbitration proceedings are at the stage of
arguments on behalf of the petitioner any further updation/amendments
requiring filing of documents/adducing the evidence shall delay the
proceedings.
49.     The Tribunal in its order has drawn a distinction between the
delay in making an application for amendment / updation as against a
claim itself being barred by limitation. There is no conclusion of the
Tribunal that the claims through amendment / updation shall be barred
by limitation. That being the position, suffice it to state there is no
final determination by the Tribunal on the merits of the claims sought
to be updated/amended which would have the effect of the counter-
claims being rejected on merits and which shall bar the petitioner from
seeking a fresh reference to arbitration in so far as those counter-claims
are concerned.      Mr. Virmani contended that if the claims have not
attained finality, then the impugned order of the Tribunal cannot be
said to be an award or even an interim award within the ambit of the
Act of 1996. In this regard, he has relied upon           the judgment in
Container Corporation of India (supra), rendered by this Court,
wherein in paragraph 6 it was held as under:
“6. I consider that dismissing of an application for
amendment of the written statement whereby the
petitioner was not allowed to include the counter claim at
a belated stage cannot be termed as an interim award so
as to allow challenging such order under Section 34. The
O.M.P. (COMM) 275/2022                                          Page 28 of 39
petitioner would be at liberty to assail the final award and
can take all the ground of challenge as available under
law as and when final award is passed by the learned
Arbitral Tribunal. The petitioner cannot be allowed to
challenge dismissal of its application for amendment as
an interim award. One of the purposes of enactment of
Arbitration & Conciliation Act, 1996 was to minimize the
intervention of the courts during arbitral proceedings and
that is why Section 5 of the Act prohibits the Courts from
interfering in the arbitration process. The judicial
intervention during arbitral proceedings is not
permissible unless it is specifically provided by Part-I of
the Act. The effect of non-obstantive clause in Section 5 is
that the provisions of Part-I of the Act will prevail over
any other law for the time being in force in India. This
provision recognizes minimum role of judicial
intervention in arbitral proceedings. It clearly brings out
the object of the Act i.e. to minimize the judicial
intervention and to encourage speedy and economic
resolution of disputes by the arbitral tribunal, in case
where the disputes are entered by the arbitration
agreement.”
50.      A similar view has been taken by a Coordinate Bench of this
Court in MBL Infrastructure Ltd. v. RITES Ltd. & Anr., OMP
(COMM) 98/2022, decided on October 14, 2022, wherein this Court
was concerned with an order dated January 8, 2022 passed by the Sole
Arbitrator in proceedings relating to the disputes between the parties
therein, whereby the learned Arbitrator has rejected the application
filed by the petitioner therein for an amendment of the Statement of
Claims on the ground of delay in seeking amendment. That apart, the
Arbitrator held that the final bill which was sought to be incorporated
in the claims, can be looked by him even without amendment of the
O.M.P. (COMM) 275/2022                                         Page 29 of 39
Statement of Claims.        This Court was of the view that above
conclusion of the learned Arbitrator cannot be construed to be a final
conclusion in so far as the enhanced quantum of claims stated to have
arisen from the final bill raised is concerned. The relevant observations
by this Court in paragraphs 23 to 25 are reproduced as under:
“23. In the opinion of this court, the decision of the present
case turns essentially on the following observations made by
the learned Arbitrator in the impugned order:
“8. Apart from the above amendment, the statement of
claim has been sought to be amended after para 126 and
127, wherein certain new pleadings have been
incorporated. I have seen the same. Except for fact of
Completion certificates and final bill, there are no
subsequent developments and other events which were not
existing at the time of filing of Statement of Claims. The
amounts as well as the description of the claims as per the
prayer clause have been changed.
“13. Contention of the Claimant that it found necessary to
amend the statement of claims after the direction by the
Arbitrator & final bill placement on 29.12.2020 is not
correct as Claimant had already filed the final bill on
03.02.2020. (refer para 10 above).
“14. I have gone through the documents submitted as well
as the judgments cited by both the parties in favour of their
arguments. I am also aware that I cannot go beyond the
terms & reference of the contract agreement. The main
dispute relates to levy of LD and the deductions by
Respondent. So far as Final Bill and the amounts passed
and entitlement of Claimant is concerned, the same can
be looked into by me, even without the amendment in
Statement of Claim, though there is some merit in the
argument of Respondent on the point that the amount of
Claims cannot be changed as per Clause 25(8) of Contract.
The manner of passing of the same, can always be looked
into by me, without amendment of Statement of Claim.
O.M.P. (COMM) 275/2022                                        Page 30 of 39
“15. In view of above, I am disallowing amendment of
Statement of Claim dated 29.01.2021 by Claimant with the
above qualification pertaining to Final Bill due to above
reasons and reason of delay.”
24. What clearly emerges from the foregoing observations of
the learned Arbitrator is that firstly, he has unequivocally said
that the petitioner‟s entitlement to any amounts arising from
the final bill as approved by respondent No. 1 (which would
take account of any deductions made by respondent No. 1) “ ...
can be looked into by me, even without the amendment in
Statement of Claims”. The learned Arbitrator has also
observed that the “... manner of passing of the same, can
always be looked into by me, without amendment of Statement
of Claims.” It is clear from these observations that the learned
Arbitrator has not taken a view nor foreclosed a decision as to
the amounts cleared by respondent No. 1 against the final bill
raised by the petitioner, which would imply that the impugned
order is not dispositive of any claims that the petitioner wishes
to raise in relation to the final bill. If any doubt was to remain
in this regard, the learned Arbitrator has, in so many words,
qualified the dismissal of the amendment application by the
following observations, which bear repetition:
“15. In view of above, I am disallowing amendment of
Statement of Claim dated 29.01.2021 by Claimant with the
above qualification pertaining to Final Bill due to above
reasons and reason of delay.”
25. Accordingly, in the opinion of this court, the impugned
order does not comprise a final determination of any of the
petitioner‟s claims, including the enhanced quantum of claims
stated to have arisen from the final bill raised upon respondent
No. 1. The impugned order is accordingly not an interim
award; and is not amenable to challenge under section 34 of
the A&C Act.”
51.     Similarly, another Coordinate Bench of this Court in the case
O.M.P. (COMM) 275/2022                                          Page 31 of 39
of Punita Bhardwaj v. Rashmi Juneja in OMP 20/2019 decided on
August 31, 2022, was concerned with an order passed by an Arbitrator
on November 4, 2019, whereby the Arbitrator decided an application
for amendment of the Statement of Claims sought by the
petitioner/claimant.   The Arbitrator vide order dated November 4,
2019, had stated the following:
“10. The first of these judgments in point of time is the
judgment in Container Corporation, wherein this Court held
“3. A perusal of the order dated 1st May 2009 passed
by the learned Arbitral Tribunal shows that the
Tribunal dismissed the application for amendment of
written statement on the ground that it was made at the
stage when the final arguments were being addressed
before the Tribunal. The claimant had already
concluded its arguments and the respondent had partly
argued the matter and the matter was posted for
hearing of remaining arguments on 28th April 2009
when it could not be taken up and was posted on 1st
May 2009 when an application under Section 23 of the
Act was filed by the petitioner for amendment of written
statement so as to include a counter claim. The
Tribunal dismissed the application having regard to the
gross delay in making application and did not consider
it appropriate to allow the prayer made in the
4. The Arbitral Tribunal has wide discretion to allow or
dismiss applications for amendment of claim or written
statement filed before it during the proceedings. There
is no provision under the Act for approaching the Court
against an order of allowing or dismissing the
amendment application. The issue pressed for by
petitioner is whether dismissing of an application of
amendment of the written statement so as to include the
counter claim amounts to giving an interim award
O.M.P. (COMM) 275/2022                                       Page 32 of 39
5. An interim award is in the nature of a decision of the
Arbitral Tribunal on some of the claims of the parties.
Occasionally, the Arbitral Tribunal is called upon to
give a part award particularly when a part of the claim
of the claimant stands admitted by the opposite party
either in the pleading or otherwise. The act does not
define an interim award. Section 2 (c) of the Act,
however provides that an arbitral award included an
interim award. Generally an interim award is like a
preliminary decree within the meaning of Section 2(2)
of the Civil Procedure Code or it is like a decree based
on the admissions of parties as envisaged under Order
12 Rule 6 CPC. However, in any case, an interim
award must make a provisional arrangement by the
Arbitral Tribunal during the proceedings pending
before it, but before passing the final award.
6. I consider that dismissing of an application for
amendment of the written statement whereby the
petitioner was not allowed to include the counter
claim at a belated stage cannot be termed as an
interim award so as to allow challenging such order
under Section 34. The petitioner would be at liberty to
assail the final award and can take all the ground of
challenge as available under law as and when final
award is passed by the learned Arbitral Tribunal. The
petitioner cannot be allowed to challenge dismissal of
its application for amendment as an interim award.
One of the purposes of enactment of Arbitration &
Conciliation Act, 1996 was to minimize the
intervention of the courts during arbitral proceedings
and that is why Section 5 of the Act prohibits the
Courts from interfering in the arbitration process. The
judicial intervention during arbitral proceedings is not
permissible unless it is specifically provided by Part-I
of the Act. The effect of non-obstantive clause in
Section 5 is that the provisions of Part-I of the Act will
prevail over any other law for the time being in force in
O.M.P. (COMM) 275/2022                                       Page 33 of 39
India. This provision recognizes minimum role of
judicial intervention in arbitral proceedings. It clearly
brings out the object of the Act i.e. to minimize the
judicial intervention and to encourage speedy and
economic resolution of disputes by the arbitral
tribunal, in case where the disputes are entered by the
arbitration agreement.”13
11. Turning to the two judgments cited by Mr. Singla, the
petitions under Section 34 of the Act were held to be
maintainable against dismissal of applications for amendment
of the statement of claims (in M/s Cinevistaas14) and of the
statement of defence (in Lt. Col. H.S. Bedi Retd.15).
12. As far as maintainability is concerned, this Court in M/s
Cinevistaas16 noticed that the impugned order rejected
amendment of certain claims on the ground that they were
barred by limitation, and observed as follows:-
“22. The question that then arises is whether the order
of the Ld. Arbitrator constitutes an „Award‟. Under
Section 2(1)(c), an award includes an „interim award‟.
Whether the impugned order in the present case
constitutes an interim award or not is to be decided by
seeing the nature of the order and not the title of the
application, which was decided. The order, in fact,
rejects the proposed amendments in claim nos. V and
VI, by holding that the same are barred by limitation.
Insofar as the difference between the newly claimed
amounts and the earlier claimed amounts are
concerned, this is a final adjudication. There is a
finality attached to the award and there is nothing in
the final award that would be dealing with these
claims. It is not just an interim award, but a rejection of
the additional claims/amounts finally.

errors, addition of new claims, correction of existing
claims, etc. Every amendment is not to be treated in the
same manner. The question in every case of amendment
is as to whether it decides a substantive issue…..”17
13. The Court relied upon the judgment of the Supreme Court
in Shah Babulal Khimji vs. Jayaben D. Kania & Anr.18,
which distinguished between an adjudication which
conclusively determines a claim and has the “characteristics
and trappings of finality”, thus giving it the characteristics of
a “judgment”, and those interlocutory orders which do not
partake of these characteristics. The Court also noticed the
judgment in India Farmers Fertilizer Cooperative Limited vs.
Bhadra Products19, wherein the Supreme Court had occasion
to consider the characteristics of an “interim award” and
held that the interim award must conclusively determine some
of the issues between the parties”.
52.     This Court, considering the above order of the Arbitrator, has
in paragraphs 18 to 21 of the judgment held as under:
“18. The three judgments of this Court cited by learned
counsel for the parties must be read in the context of this
provision. The statute clearly vests discretion in the arbitral
tribunal to disallow a party to amend or supplement its
pleadings on the ground that the application is belated. In
Container Corporation25, the amendment was rejected by the
arbitral tribunal on this ground and the challenge under
Section 34 of the Act was held not to be maintainable. In M/s
Cinevistaas26 and Lt. Col. H.S. Bedi Retd.27 on the other
hand, the Court came to the conclusion that the rejection of
the amendments were in the nature of final adjudication of the
claims and defences proposed to be raised. It is this factor
which clothed the orders of the tribunal with the
characteristic of finality and rendered them susceptible to
challenge as interim awards. This distinction, in my view, is
the key to determining the maintainability of the present
petition.
19. In the facts of the present case, the learned arbitrator has
O.M.P. (COMM) 275/2022                                         Page 35 of 39
proceeded only on the ground that the amendment was sought
belatedly. Paragraphs 12 and 13 of the impugned order make
this position clear, and in fact, in paragraph 13, the learned
arbitrator has stated that “expression of any view herein
before will not be treated as expression on the merit of the
case”.
20. Further, it is evident that the suit was filed before this
Court as far back in 2014 and referred to arbitration in the
year 2016. The application for amendment was filed by the
petitioner only on 21.07.2017. Even thereafter, it is recorded
by the learned arbitrator that the matter proceeded without
the petitioner seeking an adjudication of the said application
until 04.11.2019, when the impugned order was passed. In the
meanwhile, proceedings continued before the learned
arbitrator, and issues appear to have been framed in these
proceedings on 17.05.2018.28 During the pendency of the
present petition before this Court also, I am informed that the
parties have proceeded to lead evidence before the learned
arbitrator and the proceedings are now at the stage of final
arguments.
21. In view of the aforesaid position, I am of the view that the
impugned order in the present case does not constitute an
interim award, susceptible to challenge under Section 34 of
the Act. The petition is, therefore, dismissed as not
maintainable, leaving it open to the parties to take such
remedies as may be available to them in accordance with
law.”
53.     Ms. Acharya in support of her submission has relied upon the
judgment in the case of Cinevistaas (supra). Suffice to state that the
said judgment has no applicability to the facts of this case inasmuch as
this Court while considering Section 34 petition has inter alia with
regard to the question whether the order of the Arbitrator is an interim
order which can be appealed against in this Court, held that the
decision whether the order is an award or an interim award is to be
O.M.P. (COMM) 275/2022                                        Page 36 of 39
made based on the nature of the order and not the title of the
application. In that case, the Court set aside the Arbitrator‟s rejection
of the proposed amendment, by holding that the same were barred by
limitation and as such is a final adjudication. In so far as the additional
amounts that were sought to be claimed are concerned, as an element
of finality has been attached to the award, the Court in those factual
circumstances held that the petition under Section 34 of the Act of
1996 is maintainable.
54.      The facts in Cinevastaas (supra) and the facts herein as
demonstrated above are at variance, inasmuch in the present case, the
Tribunal has only rejected the application for amendment on the
ground that the same has been made after a long lapse of time. In fact,
it has granted liberty to the petitioner herein to invoke a fresh
arbitration insofar as the claims sought to be put forth through the
application are concerned. Surely, the petitioner shall be at liberty to
take all pleas on the maintainability of the claims in such arbitration. In
fact, from paragraph 7.20 of the impugned order, it can be seen that the
Tribunal has refrained itself from going into the issue of limitation and
waiver. In other words, the issue of limitation with regard to the merits
of the updation / amendment sought by the petitioner has not been
adverted to by the Tribunal at all. If that be so, it cannot be said that
such claims of the petitioner have been decided finally, and as such the
impugned order does not fulfill the requirements of an award or an
interim award under the Act of 1996. So the impugned order not
having the nature of an interim award, this Court is of the view that the
petition under Section 34 shall not be maintainable.

55.      Insofar as the judgments in Farmers Fertilizer Co-operative
Limited (supra) and Lt. Col. H.S. Bedi (Retd) and Anr. (supra) as
relied upon by Ms. Acharya are concerned, the said judgments are
distinguishable in the facts, as in those cases, the impugned orders
finally determined the amendments sought by the parties, inter-alia on
the ground of limitation, and as such are not applicable for the purpose
of determining the present issue.
56.      The decision in A.K. Gupta and Sons (supra) has been relied
upon by Ms. Acharya to contend that if an amendment does not add on
to the facts already on record, such an amendment would be allowed
even after the statutory period of limitation. She had also referred to
the judgment in K.K. Scaria (supra) wherein the High Court of Kerala
had held the power to allow amendment is considerably wide under
Section 23(3) of the Act of 1996 and is not circumscribed as in the case
of a suit by provisions of CPC. Surely, given the fact that the Tribunal
in this case has exercised its jurisdiction and was of the view that
allowing any amendment would further delay the proceedings, the said
judgments would not come to the aid of the petitioner.
57.      As this Court has only considered the maintainability of the
petition, the reliance placed by Ms. Acharya on the judgments in
Dhannalal (supra) and Gammon India (supra) to contend that to
avoid multiplicity of litigation, the amendment would have been
allowed, has become inconsequential. She has also relied upon the
judgments in the cases of Shree Ganesh Petroleum Rajgurunagar
(supra), Associate Builders (supra) and Ssangyong Engineering and
Construction Company Ltd. (supra) which relate to the scope of
O.M.P. (COMM) 275/2022                                       Page 38 of 39
interference of Courts with an arbitral award in a petition under
Section 34 of the Act of 1996. Similarly, the judgments of the Supreme
Court and this Court in Indian Oil Corporation Ltd.-I and II (supra),
has also been relied upon to buttress the submission that the JV is not
discharged from its liability even after the contract is terminated and
the work is awarded to a third party. In light of my finding that the
present petition under Section 34 of the Act of 1996 is not
maintainable, these judgments also would have no applicability.
58.      In view of my above conclusion, the present petition and
connected application are dismissed. No costs.
