2.     The issue in this reference is whether the combined weight
of the L.S.D. and the blotter or just the weight of the pure L.S.D.
is relevant to determine the small or commercial quantity and the
consequent punishment under the NDPS Act, 1985.
3.     Hitesh Hemant Malhotra vs. State of Maharashtra 1,
delivered by S. K.Shinde, J. holds that only the weight of the Pure
L.S.D. matters. In Narcotics Control Bureau vs. Anuj
1 2020 S.C.C. online Bom. 3581
Keshwani and anr.2, Revati Mohite Dere, J. holds that the
combined weight of the blotter impregnated with L.S.D. is
determinative in such matters.
4.     On 28.07.2022, S. K. Shinde, J. made a referral order in
Criminal Application (Bail) No.752/2021 (F) after noticing the
above conflict and formulated the following questions for
reference to a Bench of two Judges.
i. Whether blotter paper forms an integral part of the
L.S.D. (drug), when put on it for consumption and,
as such, weight of blotter paper containing L.S.D.
will have to be considered for the purpose of
determining small or commercial quantity of the
offending drug, under the Narcotic Drugs &
ii. Whether blotter paper that carries drug (L.S.D.
drops) which facilitate its consumption, as a whole is
preparation or mixture or neutral substance within
the meaning of the Narcotic Drugs & Psychotropic
5.     Based on the above, The Hon'ble The Chief Justice, by
Order dated 02.08.2022, referred the above two issues raised for
consideration by the Regular Division Bench. Accordingly, the
reference was heard on 12.10.2022, 17.10.2022, 18.10.2022 and
19.10.2022. Upon conclusion of the hearing, reference was
reserved for orders on 19.10.2022, which was the last sitting of
the Division Bench before the Diwali vacations.
6.      At the outset, Mr Anil Singh learned Additional Solicitor
General of India submitted that this reference was incompetent
and should be returned unanswered because the referral order
neither disagrees with nor doubts the reasoning and conclusion in
Anuj Keshwani (supra). He submits that the referral order does
not quote Rule 8 of Chapter I of the Bombay High Court
Appellate Side Rules, 1960 and opines that the matter could be
more advantageously heard by a Bench of two or more judges. He
submits that the absence of such "jurisdictional facts," the
reference is incompetent. He relies on Arun Kumar & Ors. vs.
Union       of    India 3, Trimurti       Fragrances  (P) Ltd. vs.
Government of N.C.T., Delhi 4 and Kerala State Science and
Technology Museum vs. Rambal Co. & Ors. 5 in support of
these contentions.
7.      Mr Rizwan Merchant points out that the referral order
notes the conflict between Hitesh Malhotra (supra), which was
incidentally delivered by the referral judge and Anuj Keshwani
(supra). He submits that the referral order must be read and
construed holistically. He presents that Hitesh Malhotra (supra)
and Anuj Keshwani (supra) have considered Hira Singh vs.
Union of India 6, and therefore the doctrine of per incuriam was
not attracted. Mr Merchant relied on some decisions in support
of his submissions. Based upon this, Mr Merchant submits that
the reference was perfectly competent.
8.     In our judgment,      the referral order must be read and
construed holistically, keeping in mind the background in which
the same was made. The orders of the Court are not Statutes and,
therefore, must not be interpreted like Statutes. The circumstance
that the referral judge decided Hitesh Malhotra (supra) is also
relevant and cannot be ignored.
9.     The referral order explicitly refers to the conflict between
Hitesh Malhotra (supra) and Anuj Keshwani (supra). The referral
order styles the view of the Coordinate Bench in Anuj Keshwani
(supra) as "a contrary view". The very use of this expression,
coupled with the significant circumstance that the referral judge
himself delivered Hitesh Malhotra (supra), makes it clear that the
referral judge stands by his view in Hitesh Malhotra (supra) and
regards the view in Anuj Keshwani (supra) as a contrary view,
with which he disagrees. Even the Hon'ble The Chief Justice,
though on the administrative side, construed the referral order as
noting the conflicting views on the subject and, consequently, the
necessity of the issue being decided by a Bench of two judges.
10.    After recording the conflict between the two sets of
decisions, the referral order states that "it would be appropriate to
refer the following issues to a Bench of two Judges ". Again, this
expression suggests that the referral judge deemed it appropriate
to propose a reference to a Bench of two judges so that the
contrary views on the same subject and the resultant uncertainty
do not persist. This is another and perhaps a more elegant way of
saying that this issue could be more advantageously decided by a
Bench of two or more judges.
11.    Besides, as was pointed out by Mr Merchant, the
conflicting decisions specifically noted the Supreme Court
decision in Hira Singh (supra). Anuj Keshwani (supra) followed
the binding precedent, but Hitesh Malhotra (supra) distinguished
it. Even Anuj Keshwani (supra) does not give a clear finding
about Hitesh Malhotra (supra) being per incuriam. There is only
the sentence in para 35 about "the orders in Hitesh Malhotra
(supra) and Harsh Meshram vs. The State of Maharashtra 7
cannot be said to have any binding effect".
12.    Therefore, it is apparent that the two Learned Single Judges
have reached different findings or conclusions on the issue of
whether the combined weight of the blotter and L.S.D. is
determinative in such matters. The referral order refers explicitly
to the contrary views on the subject and then opines about the
appropriateness of a reference to a Bench of two judges. Based on
all this, we are satisfied that this reference is competent and is best
decided on its merits. The decisions Mr Singh relied upon do not
apply or are distinguishable. The same are discussed briefly
13.    Arun       Kumar          (supra)      is     inapplicable because no
jurisdictional facts are involved, and the jurisdictional parameters
essential to sustaining a reference are very much present. Trimurti
Fragrances (supra) states that a reference is incompetent without
conflict between two decisions. Here, the conflict is apparent.
Kerala State Science and Technology Museum (supra) does not
apply because, as the Reference Court, we do not propose
adjudicating upon any issue alien to the questions referred.
Shakuntalabai Krishna Bhoyar & Ors. vs. State of
7 Criminal Bail Application No.1671 of 2021 decided on 13.05.2021
Maharashtra, through Collector, Nagpur 8 explains that a
decision rendered by the High Court without considering a
binding precedent of the Supreme Court on the subject would be
per incuriam. Here, Hira Singh (supra) was considered in the
conflicting decisions.
14.    On merits, Mr Rizwan Merchant, Ms C. Collasso and Mr
K. Poulekar submitted that the weight of the blotter paper must
be excluded because L.S.D. on a blotter was not a mixture, and a
blotter was not a "neutral substance" in the context of L.S.D.
They referred to the definition of coca leaf in Sections 2(vi) and
opium in 2(xv) of the NDPS Act. They offered that wherever the
weight of neutral substance was intended to be considered, the
Legislature has said so. Emphasizing the word "such", they urged
that a preparation or mixture under the NDPS Act contemplates
a preparation or mixture of two or more drugs or psychotropic
15.    Mr Merchant submitted that Anuj Keshwani (supra) was
based on the incorrect premise that the consumers invariably
swallow the blotter along with the L.S.D. drop on it and that it
was impossible to separate L.S.D. once dissolved in a solvent and
dropped on a blotter. He repeatedly raised that after a blotter with
L.S.D. drop is placed on the tongue or licked, the L.S.D. upon it
is infused in the consumer's body leaving behind a benign blotter
without any traces of L.S.D. on it. He submits that such a benign
blotter may or may not be swallowed by the consumer. He offered
that since the scientific techniques had made it possible to
determine the exact contents of the pure L.S.D. from the blotter,
there is no good reason for taking into account the weight of the
blotter to decide whether the quantity is small, intermediate or
16.    Mr Merchant submits that interpretation in Anuj
Keshwani (supra)       exposes the provisions to the charge of
discrimination and violation of fundamental rights guaranteed to
an accused under the Constitution of India. He submits that the
dosage of pure L.S.D. is so tiny that a dealer or a peddler with
several doses of pure L.S.D. may qualify to be sentenced for
possessing a small or intermediate quantity. In contrast, the
consumer, if the weight of the blotter is to be included, may be
convicted for possessing to commercial quantity. He submits that
such discriminatory results can be avoided by excluding the
weight of the blotter and focusing on pure L.S.D. contents.
17.    Mr Merchant, Ms Collasso and Mr Poulekar submitted
that Hira Singh (supra) would have no application in the context
of L.S.D., which is unique in its characteristics and properties.
They propose that the observations in Hira Singh (supra) must be
restricted in the context of the drug " heroin". They submitted
that even Hira Singh (supra) holds that L.S.D. blotter is only a
carrier, facilitating its consumption. However, the same is neither
a preparation nor a mixture within the meaning of the NDPS
18.    Mr Merchant submitted that no reliance could be placed
on Richard L. Chapman vs. United States 9 and Finch vs. The
Queen 10 because the legislative schemes of the Statutes in the
United States of America and Australia were at a tangent from the
statutory scheme of the NDPS Act in India. He offered that even
the International Convention, to which India is a party, provides
that the applicability of any foreign legislation would depend
upon the domestic or applicable Constitutional provisions.
Finally, Mr Merchant submitted that even Hira Singh (supra)
merely referred to Chapman (supra) but did not rely upon it.
19.    For all the above reasons, Mr Merchant, Ms Collasso and
Mr Poulekar commended the adoption of the view in Hitesh
Malhotra (supra) and Harsh Meshram (supra) in preference to the
view in Anuj Keshwani (supra).
20.    Per Contra, Mr Anil Singh submitted that the preparation,
defined under Section 2(xx), includes a mixture. A plain reading
of the definition along with Note 4 below S.O. dated 19.10.2001
makes it clear that a blotter containing L.S.D. would be a
preparation (which includes a mixture) of a psychotropic
substance. Therefore, the entire weight must be taken into
consideration. He submits that the L.S.D., which is admittedly a
psychotropic substance combined with a blotting paper, would
amount to a mixture. He submits that the L.S.D., when put on a
blotting paper, would also amount to a dosage since that is how
L.S.D. is consumed. He, therefore, commended the adoption of
the view taken by Anuj Keshwani (supra).
21.    Mr Singh and Mr Bhobe referred to the Statement of
Objects and reasons for the amendment Act 2016 and the dictum
in Hira Singh (Supra). They offered the dictum in Hira Singh
(supra) was a drug or psychotropic substance-agnostic dictum.
The principles in the said decision would equally apply to L.S.D.
They submitted that the principles in Chapman (supra) or Finch
(supra) apply to the issue at hand and must be considered, given
their persuasive value.
22.   The rival contentions now fall for our consideration.
23.   The Scheme of the NDPS Act provides graded sentences
for possession of small, intermediate and commercial quantities of
narcotic drugs or psychotropic substances. Therefore, the
penalties or the sentencing has a direct nexus with the amount of
the contraband psychotropic substance.
24.   Besides, Section 37 of the NDPS Act imposes certain
limitations when granting bail for offences involving a
commercial quantity        of narcotic drugs or       psychotropic
substances. These limitations are in addition to those under the
Cr.P.C. or any other law for the time being in force.
25.   Therefore, much turns on the issue of the quantification of
the contraband drug or the psychotropic substance in the context
of sentencing after trial and bail during the trial. The two
questions referred to in paragraph 5 of Justice Shinde's referral
order dated 28.07.2022 or in the actual referral order dated
02.08.2022 in sum and substance require us to consider whether,
in determining small, intermediate or commercial quantities, the
combined weight of the blotter impregnated L.S.D. or just the
pure L.S.D. is the crucial determining factor.
26.    Hitesh Malhotra (supra), decided by the referral judge S. K.
Shinde, J., has held that only the weight of pure L.S.D. is the
determining factor and not the combined weight of blotter and
L.S.D. impregnated in the blotter. The Court further held that
since the blotter containing dried L.S.D. drops of L.S.D. solution
is neither a mixture nor a neutral substance, Hira Singh (supra)
has no application.
27.    Harsh Meshram (supra) was delivered by another learned
Single Judge S. P. Tavde, J. on 13.05.2021. This decision follows
Hitesh Malhotra (supra). The reasoning in paragraph 11 of
Hitesh Malhotra (supra) has been quoted verbatim in paragraph 7
of Harsh Meshram (supra). Therefore, there is no separate
reasoning in Harsh Meshram (supra).
28.    Anuj Keshwani (supra) was decided by another learned
Single Judge Revati Mohite Dere, J. on 29.11.2021. The learned
Single Judge, upon a detailed consideration of the statutory
provisions and national and international precedents on the
subject, concluded that the blotter paper forms an integral part of
L.S.D. when put on a blotter paper for consumption and, as
such, the weight of the blotter paper containing L.S.D. will have
to be considered for determining a small or commercial quantity
of the offending drug.
29.    Mr Merchant, at one stage, did contend that L.S.D. is in
liquid form and, therefore, there is arbitrariness involved in entry
133 of the Schedule measuring it in milligrams. He also argues
that each tile of the blotter alleged to be impregnated with L.S.D.
must be separately analyzed. Anuj Keshwani (supra), in
paragraphs 37 to 43, refers briefly to the later issue of separate
analysis. But both these issues are not referred to for our
consideration in this reference. Therefore, there is no question of
our addressing the said issues in this opinion. Nevertheless, this
position is made clear at the outset, lest we are otherwise
30.   The legal literature and precedents on the subject
reasonably establish that the most common method of storing,
transporting, concealing, selling, purchasing, consuming or
otherwise dealing with L.S.D is impregnating it in a blotter. Such
a blotter is not the usual ink blotter but an ultra-thin, ultra-
absorbent blotter mostly made of rice, cotton, or flax seeds. Such
a blotter impregnated with L.S.D. is placed on or below the
tongue, licked, and mostly swallowed or otherwise ingested. This
is because a pure dose of L.S.D. is exceptionally potent.
Therefore, even a typical dosage is minuscule, i.e. in the range of
30 to 150 milligrams. These were the unique characteristics or
properties referred to by the Counsel for the accused person.
31.    These so-called unique characteristics and properties are
reflected in the several reported matters on the subject. Hitesh
Malhotra (supra) and Anuj Keshwani (supra) also refer to these
aspects in the precise context of L.S.D. on a blotter. Even the
written submissions by the learned Additional Solicitor General
and the learned Counsel for the accused person have referred to
these aspects. There is no significant variation between the two
versions. Thus, the Counsel raised no serious or irreconcilable
disputes on these factual aspects. Therefore, referencing these
factual aspects and noticing how they have been addressed would
assist in evaluating the subject's statutory provisions and
32.    Hitesh Malhotra (supra) records that L.S.D. is sold on the
streets in small tablets (microdots), capsules or gelatin squares. It
is so potent that a small effective dose of the pure drug is virtually
invisible (inconceivable). As a result, it is usually diluted with
other materials. In the said case, L.S.D. was found in the form of
drops dried on 23 pieces of paper (blotters). The Court noted
that the most common form of L.S.D. is a drop of L.S.D.
solution dried on to piece of paper or gelatin sheet, pieces of
blotter paper which release the drop when swallowed/consumed.
From this, the Court noted that drying L.S.D. on a piece of paper
merely facilitates L.S.D. consumption. This process neither
changes the drug (psychotropic substance) nor its chemical
33.    Anuj Keshwani (supra), records that L.S.D. is often added
to absorbent paper, such as 'blotter paper'. The paper can be
divided into small squares, 'tabs', with each square representing
one dose called a 'hit'. Unlike toilet paper or tissue paper, blotter
paper appears to be made from an extra-absorbent material and
generally includes ingredients such as rice, cotton and even flax
seed. It is impossible to visually identify the strength or type of
drug when buying. Drug active in the microgram range, most
notably 'L.S.D.', is commonly distributed illicitly on blotter
paper. A liquid solution of the drug is applied to the blotter
paper, which typically is perforated into individual doses. Blotter
as a delivery method allows for easy dosing of potent substances
and easy sublingual administration of drugs. The Court noted
that the standard L.S.D. dose appears to be around 30–150
micrograms (mcg). A single 'hit' on a blotter paper contains
L.S.D. in this range. Without chemical testing, it is impossible to
know the quantity of L.S.D. on the blotter paper.
34.   Thus, on the factual aspect concerning the use of a blotter
paper to facilitate the distribution, storage, sale, concealment and
consumption of L.S.D., there is no significant divergence between
Hitesh Malhotra (supra) and Anuj Keshwani (supra). Moreover,
learned Counsel referred to and relied upon several decisions,
including Harsh Meshram (supra) and Datta Paratkar vs. State
of Goa 11, Rijesh Ravindran vs. Union of India 12, Sreeraj vs.
State of Kerala 13, where blotters with L.S.D. were seized in a
form substantially similar to that described in Hitesh Malhotra
(supra) and Anuj Keshwani (supra).
35.     Chapman (supra) decided by the United States Supreme
Court records that according to the sentencing commission in
the United States, the L.S.D. in an average dose weighs 0.05
milligrams; there are, therefore, 20,000 pure doses in a gram. The
pure dose is such a tiny amount that it must be sold to retail
customers in a "carrier." First, pure L.S.D. is dissolved in a solvent
such as alcohol; either the solution is sprayed on paper or gelatin,
or the paper is dipped in the solution. The solvent evaporates,
leaving minute amounts of L.S.D. trapped in the paper or gel.
Then the paper or gel is cut into "one-dose" squares and sold by
the dose. Users either swallow the squares, lick them until the
drug is released, or drop them into a beverage, thereby releasing
the drug.
36.     Chapman (supra) also records that although L.S.D. is not
sold by weight but by dose, and a carrier medium is not, strictly
speaking, used to "dilute" the drug, that medium is used to
facilitate the distribution of the drug. Blotter paper makes L.S.D.
easier to transport, store, conceal, and sell. It is a tool of the trade
for those who traffic the drug; therefore, it was rational for
Congress to set penalties based on this chosen tool. Congress was
also justified in avoiding arguments about the accurate weight of
pure drugs that might have been extracted from blotter paper had
it chosen to calibrate sentences according to that weight. The
Court also noted that the blotter paper seems to be the carrier of
choice. The vast majority of cases will therefore do exactly what
the sentencing scheme was designed to do - punish those who
deal in larger amounts of drugs more heavily. The United States
Supreme Court held that the combined weight and not just the
weight of pure L.S.D is relevant for punishment.
37.     In United States vs. Marshall 14, the United States Court
of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, was also concerned inter alia
with the sale of ten sheets (1,000 doses) of blotter papers
containing L.S.D. Incidentally, it is against the judgment
delivered in this matter by the Seventh Circuit that the United
States Supreme Court issued certiorari and ultimately affirmed
the Majority view that the combined weight of the blotter and
L.S.D. was relevant for sentencing (Chapman's case).
38.   United States vs. Marshall (supra) records that L.S.D. and
blotter paper are not commingled in the same way as cocaine and
lactose. What is the nature of the association? The possibility
most favourable to the defendants is that L.S.D. sits on blotter
paper as oil floats on water. Immiscible substances may fall
outside the statutory definition of "mixture". The possibility does
not assist defendants - not on this record, anyway. L.S.D. is
applied to the paper in a solvent; after the solvent evaporates, a
tiny quantity of L.S.D. remains. Because the fibres absorb the
alcohol, the L.S.D. solidifies inside the paper rather than on it.
You cannot pick a grain of L.S.D. off the surface of the paper.
Ordinary parlance calls the paper containing tiny crystals of
L.S.D. a mixture.
39.   United States vs. Marshall (supra), which the U.S. Supreme
Court affirmed in Chapman (Supra), gives three reasons
supporting     the   law,   making         penalties depend   upon
gross(combined) rather than net(pure L.S.D.) weight:-
"(i) First, L.S.D. is sold at retail for a low price (a few
dollars per dose). Blotter paper apparently has contributed
to the renewed success of the drug, making it easy to
transport, store, conceal, and sell. Because the carrier
medium is an ingredient in the drug distribution business,
it is rational to design a schedule of penalties based on that
tool of the trade. Similarly, it is rational to make the
penalty depend upon a carrier that is essential to successful
distribution of the drug.
(ii) Second, extracting the "pure" drug and debating
whether that task has been done properly is unnecessary if,
99% of all cases, L.S.D. is sold in blotter paper. Why
reduce the amount to a pure measure if that almost never
spells a difference? No one has been prosecuted for
distributing L.S.D. in sugar cubes in the last 20 years.
Similarly, no one has been prosecuted for possessing
significant quantities of pure L.S.D. in the last decade.
Why worry about how to treat manufacturers caught red-
handed with pure dry L.S.D. if they are never nabbed?
Statutes rationally may be addressed to the main cases
rather than the exceptions.
(iii) Third, extracting L.S.D. from blotter paper and
weighing the drug accurately may be difficult. One dose is
an exceedingly small quantity of pure L.S.D. Counsel
suggested at oral argument that it takes a specialist in gas
chromatography to extract the drug, and that this is done
only for samples rather than the defendant's entire supply.
Figures reported in the cases (including this one) are
extrapolations from samples, not actual weights. Congress
rationally may decide to avoid a costly and imprecise
process."
40.    In United States vs. Rose 15, the United States Court of
Appeals for Seventh Circuit, this time speaking through Posner,
J. (who had filed a dissenting opinion in United States vs.
Marshall), was concerned with the L.S.D. – saturated blotter
paper with a combined weight of 7.3 grams out of which the net
weight of L.S.D. was only 0.01787 grams.
41.     The Court noted that drugs are rarely taken in undiluted
form. Instead, the active agent is combined with inactive ones.
L.S.D., which is so potent that a pure dose would be a barely
visible droplet, is commonly ingested in either of two forms. The
first is swallowing a sugar cube or candy soaked with L.S.D. in an
alcohol solution. The second involves the blotter paper, usually an
8 by 5-inch sheet sectioned in little squares, each with a spot of
L.S.D. in an alcohol solution. The user cuts off one of the
squares, swallows it, or dissolves it in a beverage. In combination
with the blotter paper, the quantity of L.S.D. that Rose sold
supplied almost 500 doses. Suppose the paper had weighed only a
seventh as much (bringing the sale down to the minimum weight
that triggers the five-year no-parole minimum term in section
841(b)(1)(B)(v), the sale would still have been of 70 doses – a
non-trivial amount. A lighter carrier than paper (remember that
this is not "blotter paper" in the conventional sense) is hard to
imagine. The Court held that the paper carrier in which L.S.D. is
sold, like the LSD-saturated sugar cube or candy, is a "substance
or mixture containing a detectable amount of L.S.D." And it is,
therefore, the weight of the carrier plus the L.S.D., rather than of
the L.S.D. alone, that determines the gravity of the offence.
42.     In United States vs. Taylor, 16 the United States Court of
Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, was again concerned with L.S.D.
on a blotter (distribution medium paper), the combined weight
of which was 17.53 grams. The Court held that it was this
combined weight that was relevant. Consistent with the
provisions of the Anti-Drug Abuse Act, if any mixture of a
compound contains any detectable amount of a controlled
substance, the entire amount of the mixture or compound shall
be considered in measuring the quantity.
43.     In United States vs. Bishop, 17 the United States Court of
Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, was again concerned with the same
issue. The Court noted from the Trial Judge's Order about the
testimony indicating that users of L.S.D. either licked the L.S.D.
from the tab of blotter paper, which dissolved the impregnated
L.S.D. with their saliva, or simply chewed and swallowed the
small square of blotter paper containing the absorbed L.S.D. The
method of ingestion was a matter of the user's personal
preference. The Trial Judge observed that what is important is
that the blotter paper itself can be and is ingested with the drug
much the same as any dilutant or cutting agent would be
44.    The Court rejected the contention that using blotting paper
as a carrier for L.S.D. provides no greater threat to society than
L.S.D. in its pure form, and therefore, Congress did not intend
that the weight of the paper be included in the weight calculation.
The Court held that this argument overlooks the fact that " the
pure chemical compound of L.S.D. is extremely potent – far too
potent to be of any use to those who would ingest it. It is,
therefore, necessary to dilute the solid L.S.D. and convert it into
an easily ingestible form." The L.S.D. carriers serve the same
function as cutting agents. The blotter paper serves the purpose of
making the L.S.D. ready for retail sale and ingestion by the user.
The Court held that Congress recognized this and intended the
weight of the carrier to be included.
45.    In United States vs. Bishop (supra), the defendants, offered
examples of L.S.D. being included in suitcases, bricks, etc., to
illustrate that absurdity results from including the weight of the
carrier in the weight calculation. The Court disposed of such
objections by observing thus:
"Appellants offer examples of L.S.D. being included in
suitcases, bricks, etc., to illustrate that absurdity results
from including the weight of the carrier in the weight
calculation. We do not believe this parade of horribles
requires that we reach a different conclusion here. Our job
is not to speculate about "extraordinary circumstances in
which a legislative scheme breaks down; we live in a real
world, and so apply the law to real world facts. ..... We will
deal with absurd situations when they are before us; for
now we will assume that Congress knew distributors like
Defendant would be faced with these enhanced sentencing
provisions."
46.   In United States vs. Daly 18, the United States Court of
Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, was again concerned with the
seizure of approximately 755 grams of blotter paper impregnated
with L.S.D. The test later revealed that the " un-cut" L.S.D.
contained in the paper weighed about 2.33 grams. The Court
noted that the distributors normally "cut" the L.S.D. by
impregnating the pure, liquid drug in sugar cubes or blotter
paper. Users then take the drug by ingesting the sugar or paper.
Therefore, the dispositive question was whether blotter paper
impregnated with L.S.D. constitutes a "mixture or substance
containing a detectable amount" of the drug. The Court held that
it does and affirmed the decision of the Trial Court using the
combined weight of the un-cut L.S.D. and the blotter paper to
determine the defendant's base offence level.
47.    In United States vs. Elrod 19, the United States Court of
Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, was concerned with a conviction
for possessing L.S.D. on a blotter paper. The combined weight of
the blotter with the L.S.D. on it was approximately 11 grams, of
which 0.09 grams were pure L.S.D. The Court noted that the
blotter paper referred to is not the type of paper used to absorb
ink. Rather, it is considerably thinner, of the same consistency,
and generally off-white in colour. Most often, the blotter paper is
perforated into 1-inch sections upon which approximately 25
micrograms (the amount of a normal dosage) of L.S.D. are
placed. The impregnated square is sometimes ingested; at other
times, it is used to transfer the L.S.D. for ingestion by other
means. The Court ultimately affirmed the Trial Court's sentence
based upon the blotter's and L.S.D's combined weight.
48.    In United States vs. Larsen 20, the United States Court of
Appeals for the Tenth Circuit, was again concerned with the
L.S.D. on a blotter. The Court noted the substance was sold with
individual drops absorbed or spotted on blotter paper. The Court
concluded, in agreement with all of the other Circuit-level de-
cisions, that the weight of the blotter paper was considered cor-
rectly, mainly because the blotter paper is often ingested with the
L.S.D. and is one of the most commonly used carrier mediums
for L.S.D., as well as one of the least weighty. The Court noted
that it did not have an absurd fact situation, such as a hit of
L.S.D. placed on a two-pound brick before it. The Court held
that it would deal with such an unusual situation when it comes
before it and not in the abstract.
49.    Thus, practically, all the United States Circuit Courts of
Appeals addressing this issue have dealt with the L.S.D. on
blotters and held that the weight of the entire substance or the
combined weight should be used to determine the appropriate
sentence and not just the weight of the pure L.S.D. on the
50.    Michell Ram Calame writing in the Louisiana Law
Review (Article 8, Vol.52, 5th May 1992), records that all District
Courts in the United States addressing the issue except one have
held similarly. Thus, an overwhelming number of Courts in the
United States have decided to include the weights of the pure
drug or psychotropic substances to determine sentences. As noted
earlier, such decisions of the District Courts and the Court of
Appeals have been affirmed by the United States Supreme Court
51.    In Finch (supra), decided by the Criminal Court of Appeals
for New South Wales (Australia), L.S.D. was impregnated within
a cardboard square. There was evidence that the cardboard square
was designed to be swallowed and, accordingly, the cardboard
impregnated with L.S.D. was ingested by a user. The cardboard
was not analogous to a container or syringe from which the user
extracted a drug. A much closer analogy would be the non-drug
content of a film coating or a gelatin capsule used in producing
lawful drugs as described by the Full Federal Court in Sigma
Pharmaceuticals (Australia) Pty Ltd vs. Wyeth 21. That film
coating or gelatin capsule is an integral part of the ingestion by
the user of the drug. In the same way, the Court held that the
cardboard impregnated with L.S.D. was an integral part of the
ingestion by the user of the drug and thus a "preparation" or a
"substance" within the meaning of Section 4 of the Drug Misuse
52.    On this factual aspect, even Hira Singh (supra), in
paragraph 10.3, records that illicit drugs are seldom sold in pure
form. They are almost always adulterated or cut with other
substances. For example, caffeine mixed with Heroin causes that
Heroin to vaporize at a lower rate. That could allow users to take
the drug faster and get a big punch sooner. Aspirin, crushed
tablets, could have enough powder to amend reversal doses of
drugs. Take the example of Heroin. It is known as a powerful and
illegal street drug and opiate derived from morphine. This drug
can easily be "cut" with a variety of different substances. This
means that drug dealers will add other drugs or non-intoxicating
substances to the drug so they can sell more of it at a lesser
expense to themselves. Brown sugar/smack is usually made
available in powder form. The substance is only about 20%
heroin. The Heroin is mixed with other substances like chalk
powder and zinc oxide; brown sugar is cheaper but more
dangerous because of these impurities in the drug. These are only
a few examples demonstrating that even a mixture of narcotic or
psychotropic substances is more dangerous.
53.    The Supreme Court noted that, therefore, what is harmful
or injurious is the entire mixture/tablets with neutral substances
and Narcotic Drugs or Psychotropic Substances. Therefore, going
only by the weight of the pure drug or psychotropic substance
would frustrate the intention and purpose of enacting the NDPS
Act. There may be few punishments for "commercial quantity".
Indeed, that would not have been the intention of the Legislature.
54.    The Supreme Court noted that even considering the
definition of "manufacture", "manufactured drug", and the
"preparation" conjointly, the total weight of such "manufactured
drug" or "preparation", including the neutral material, is required
to be considered while determining the small quantity or
commercial quantity. Only such an interpretation would achieve
the objectives and purpose of the NDPS Act. Any other
interpretation to defeat the object and purpose of enactment of
the NDPS Act as a deterrent.
55.    Thus, both Nationally as well as Internationally, there
appears to be a common ground as to the mode or how L.S.D. is
usually dealt with in the market or on the streets or the mode or
manner in which L.S.D. is consumed by impregnating it into a
blotter and after that, at least in most cases, ingesting L.S.D.
along with the blotter. Mr Merchant, however, did urge that the
users place the L.S.D. impregnated into the blotter either on or
below their tongue or simply lick the same, and what remains is a
benign blotter free from any traces of L.S.D.
56.    However, no material was produced in support of the above
submission except to say that there are instances where the blotter
is not actually ingested but spat out. Suffice it to state that the
Legislature is presumed to know the existing state of affairs,
including the market or the street conditions, before it enacts any
57.   Therefore, the swallowing or chewing of the blotter cannot
become a significant distinguishing factor. Besides, the extreme
instances or examples raised in the abstract cannot govern
statutory interpretation in all cases. Nevertheless, the review of
precedents, Nationally and internationally, establish that the
combined weight of the blotter and the L.S.D. is crucial to the
quantification upon which the punishment depends.
58.   Coming to the statutory provisions and the regime in the
NDPS Act, there is no dispute about L.S.D. being a psychotropic
substance as defined under Section 2(xxiii) read with Entry 4 in
the Schedule, where it is described as L.S.D., LSD-25. The
international non-proprietary name specified in the Schedule is
(+) - LYSERGIDE. The chemical name is specified as (+)-N. N-
Diethyllysergamide (D-lysergic acid diethylamide).
59.   Section 2(xxiii) defines "psychotropic substance" means any
substance, namely natural or synthetic or any natural material or
any salt or preparation of such substance or material included in
the list of psychotropic substances specified in the Schedule.
Thus, a psychotropic substance includes a preparation thereof.
Alternatively, the preparation of psychotropic substances is also
covered under the definition of psychotropic substance.
60.    The term "preparation" is defined under Section 2(xx). The
same reads as follows:-
"preparation", in relation to a narcotic drug or
psychotropic substance means any one or more such drugs
or substances in dosage form or any solution or mixture,
in whatever physical state, containing one or more such
drugs or substances"
61.    The expressions "small quantity" and "commercial
quantity" are defined under Section 2(xxiiia) and Section 2(viia)
of the NDPS Act as meaning quantities lesser than or greater than
the quantity specified by the Central Government by Notification
in the Official Gazette. The Central Government has issued a
notification S.O. 1055(E) dated 19.10.2001 in the exercise of
powers conferred by clauses (viiia) and (xxiiia) of Section 2 of the
NDPS Act specifying the small and commercial quantities. The
subject of L.S.D. is dealt with in entry 133 of the Table below the
Notification dated 19.10.2001.
62.    The Notification dated 19.10.2001, the relevant extracts of
entries 133, 239 and the notes below the Table inserted inter alia
by S.O. 822(E) dated 27.02.2018 and S.O. 2941(E) dated
18.11.2009 are quoted below for the convenience of reference:

including salts of esters, ethers and isomers, wherever existence of
such substance is possible and not just its pure drug content.)
1. Inserted by S.O. 822(E), dated 27-2-2018.
2. Inserted by S.O. 2941(E), dated 18-11-2009.
63.   Thus, on a plain reading of the above definitions, it is
apparent that the term "preparation", in relation to a narcotic
drug or psychotropic substance, means not only any one or more
such drugs or substances in dosage form or any solution but also a
mixture, in whatever physical state, containing one or more such
drugs or substances. Therefore, the contention that a preparation
or mixture must contain two or more narcotic drugs or two or
more psychotropic substances or a combination of a narcotic drug
and psychotropic substance is untenable on a plain reading of the
definition in Section 2(xx) as quoted above. Moreover, such a
contention is unsustainable given Entry 239 in the Table below
the Notification dated 19.10.2001 and the notes below the same.
In any case, such an argument was squarely raised but rejected by
the Supreme Court in Hira Singh (supra).
64.   There is an express indication in the NDPS Act about
taking into account the entire quantity of the drug or the
psychotropic substance seized in a case for determining the
quantum of punishment and not just the pure drug content
alone. This is evident from the following :
(i)      The statement of objects and reasons to the
amendment Act 16 of 2014, in terms provides that since
the NDPS Act duly provides for punishment for the
preparation of drugs also, this amendment seeks to clarify
the legislative intent to take the entire quantity of drug
seized in a case for determining the quantum of
punishment and not the pure drug content. As noted
hereafter, "preparation" in relation to a narcotic drug or
psychotropic substance specifically includes "mixture" in
whatever physical state containing one or more such
narcotic drugs or psychotropic substances. Thus, the
legislative intent is clear that the entire quantity of the
preparation is to be taken into account and weighed for
determining the quantum of punishment and not merely
the pure drug content for such preparation or mixture;
(ii) Section 2 (xx) defines "preparation" in relation to a
narcotic drug or psychotropic substance means any one or
more such drugs or substances in dosage from or any
solution or mixture, in whatever physical state, containing
one or more such drugs or substances. Thus, it is evident
that "preparation" includes a mixture, in whatever physical
state, containing one or more such drugs or substances. So,
the L.S.D. and a substance that may or may not be either a
drug or a psychotropic substance, i.e., a neutral substance.
The definition explicitly provides that such mixture may be
"in whatever physical state", but as long as such a mixture
contains one or more such drugs or substances, the same
would constitute a "preparation" under Section (xx) of the
(iii) Section 2 (xxiii) defines "psychotropic substance" to
mean any substance, natural or synthetic, or any natural
material or any salt or preparation of such substance or
material included in the list of psychotropic substances
specified in the Schedule. The Schedule at Entry 4 includes
L.S.D., L.S.D. 25. Therefore, there is no dispute about the
L.S.D. being a psychotropic substance. However, Section
2(xxiii) includes not only a psychotropic substance specified
in the Schedule but also a "preparation" of such substance
or material included in the list of psychotropic substances
specified in the Schedule. As noted earlier, the definition of
"preparation" explicitly includes a mixture, in whatever
physical state, containing one or more psychotropic
substances. Thus, it is clear that a mixture of L.S.D. and
blotter would constitute a psychotropic substance as
defined under Section 2(xxviii) of the NDPS Act.
(iv)    Section 2(xxiii) refers to a list of psychotropic
substances specified in the Schedule. As noted earlier, the
L.S.D. finds a mention in Entry 4. Entry 111 of this
Schedule refers to "salts and preparations of the above".
This means Entry 111 refers to salts and preparations of the
psychotropic substances listed in Entries 1 to 110. A
preparation, as noted earlier, would include a mixture
containing L.S.D. Thus, even the preparation of L.S.D. will
amount to a psychotropic substance in terms of Section
2(xxiii) of the NDPS Act.
(v)   Even the definition of "manufacture" in Section 2(x)
includes making of preparation (otherwise than in a
pharmacy on prescription) with or containing such drugs or
substances. The expression makes it clear that even making
a preparation (which includes a mixture) with L.S.D. or
containing L.S.D. would constitute "manufacture" as
defined under Section 2(x) of the NDPS Act.
(vi) Sections 2(xxiiia) and 2(viia) define "small quantity"
and "commercial quantity" in relation to narcotic drugs
and psychotropic substances. In terms of these definition
clauses, the Central Government has issued a notification
dated 19.10.2001, as amended from time to time. Entry
133 of this Notification specifically refers to L.S.D., L.S.D.
25. However, what is more relevant is Entry 239, which
refers to any mixture or preparation with or without a
neutral material or any of the above drugs. From the
context, it is apparent that the expression "drugs" would
include both the narcotic drugs and psychotropic
substances listed in Entries 1 to 238. Therefore, no contrary
contention on this aspect was even raised before us. Thus, it
is clear that the Notification contemplates not only the
narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances but also any
mixture or preparation that of with or without neutral
material of any of the narcotic drugs and psychotropic
substances listed in entries 1 to 238 of the Notification.
(vii) The Notification dated 19.10.2001, in the context of
Entry 239, provides the mode of determining the small or
commercial quantity of the mixture or preparation. It
provides that lesser of the small quantity between the
quantities given against the respective narcotic drugs or
psychotropic substances mentioned above forming part of
the mixture will have to be considered. The same also
applies to the determination of commercial quantities. Note
4 below this Notification is most important because it states
that the quantities shown in column 5 and column 6 of the
Table relating to the respective drugs shown in column 2
shall apply to the entire mixture or any solution or any one
or more narcotic drugs or psychotropic substances of that
particular drug in dosage form or isomer, esters, ethers and
salts of these drugs, including salts of esters, ethers and
isomers, wherever existence of such substance is possible
and not just its pure drug content.
65.     The statutory provisions and the scheme of the NDPS Act
referred to above clearly provide, in more places than one, that
the weight of the entire mixture and not just its pure drug
content must be taken into account for determining whether the
quantity is small, intermediate quantity or a commercial quantity.
Moreover, the statement of object and reasons for introducing the
amendment to the NDPS Act in 2014 explicitly clarifies the
legislative intent to take the entire quantity of drug seized in a
case for determining the quantum of punishment and not just the
pure drug content.
66.    This amendment was introduced after the decision of the
Division Bench of the Supreme Court in E. Michael Raj vs.
Narcotics Control Bureau 22 which held that a pure drug content
and not the entire weight of the mixture being relevant is also a
significant factor. Ultimately, E. Michael Raj (supra) was
overruled by Hira Singh (supra). Hira Singh (supra) held that the
legal position before E. Michael Raj (supra) that the entire
quantity of the drug seized would be relevant to determine the
quantum of punishment and not just the pure drug content.
Thus, considering the legislative intervention after E. Michael Raj
(supra) and the judicial overruling of E. Michael Raj (supra) by
Hira Singh (supra), any argument that only the weight of pure
L.S.D. is relevant to determining the quantum of punishment,
would not not sustain.
67.    In the context of the definition of "preparation" in Section
2(xx), the expression "mixture, in whatever physical state" cannot
be ignored. This expression would include a mixture of L.S.D.
and blotter. Ultimately, there is no dispute that the L.S.D.
dissolved in a solution like alcohol is dropped on the blotter. The
mixture of L.S.D. on the blotter is then ingested. Therefore, the
expression "in whatever physical state" cannot be ignored or
rendered meaningless or redundant. The fact that the Legislature
chose to use this expression expressly will have to be respected and
given some meaning.
68.    Similar is the position of the statutory provisions referred to
above or the statutory Notification issued under the NDPS Act.
The suitable meaning having regard to the context, will have to
be assigned to expressions like "mixture or substance" and
"containing one or more such drugs or substances". The
expression "one or more" cannot be read or construed as "two or
more". In the statutory Notification dated 19.10.2001, the
expression in Entry 239 of the Table concerning " any mixture or
preparation that of with or without a neutral material " must be
considered and respected. Similarly, in note 4, a reference to
"entire mixture" and "not just its pure drug content" must be
considered and respected. If the interpretation or construction
suggested by the learned Counsel for the accused persons is
accepted, most of these expressions used by the Legislature or the
Executive in the statutory Notification would be rendered otiose
or meaningless.
69.   By now, it is very well settled that just as a court of law
must not add words or fill in gaps or a lacuna, an effort should
also be made to give meaning to each and every word used by the
Legislature. In Aswini Kumar Ghose vs. Arabinda Bose, 23 the
Supreme Court held that it is not a sound construction principle
to brush aside words in a Statute as being inapposite surplusage if
they can have appropriate application in the circumstances
conceivably within the contemplation of the Statute.
70.   In Rao Shiv Bahadur Singh vs. State of U.P., 24 the
Supreme Court held that it is incumbent on the Court to avoid
construction, if reasonably permissible, on the language which
would render a part of the Statute devoid of any meaning or
Ltd. vs. State of U.P. 25, the Supreme Court held that the Courts
always presume that the Legislature inserted every part thereof for
a purpose and the legislative intention is that every part of the
Statute should have an effect.
71.    In Quebec Railway, Light, Heat & Power Co. vs.
Vandry 26, followed in Union of India vs. Hansoli Devi 27, the
Privy Council and Supreme Court held that the Legislature is
deemed not to waste its words or to say anything in vain.
Consequently, a construction which attributes redundancy to the
Legislature will not be accepted except for compelling reasons.
72.    Except for submitting that the L.S.D. has some unique
characteristics or properties, no compelling reason was presented
before us to exclude the explicit expressions used in the NDPS
Act or the statutory Notification issued thereunder. Moreover,
this is a case where the statutory provisions align with the
legislative intent expressed in the statement of objects and
reasons. The S.O.R expressly clarified the legislative intent to
take the entire quantity of the drug to determine the quantum of
punishment and not just the drug content.
73.    The so-called unique properties of L.S.D., referred to by
the Counsel for the accused persons, far from being sufficient to
exclude the application of the statutory provisions, lend support
to the argument that the Legislature was quite clear about
including not only all kinds of drugs and psychotropic substances
but also their preparations, which would consist of the mixture of
one or more narcotic drugs or psychotropic substances, together
with or without neutral substances, in whatever physical state.
Based on all this, the contentions of the learned Counsel for the
accused persons are hard to accept. Such contentions find support
neither from the text nor the context. Such arguments run
contrary to the exact words in the Statute & Statutory
notifications and derive no support from the legislative intent
stated in the S.O.R.
74.    The precedents on the subject also overwhelmingly support
the inclusion of the weight of the blotter and not just the weight
of the pure L.S.D. Before E. Micheal Raj (Supra), that was the
consistent view, as observed by the Supreme Court in Hira Singh
(Supra). In E. Michael Raj (supra), the Division Bench of the
Supreme Court, however, held that when any narcotic drug or
psychotropic substance is found mixed with one or more neutral
substance(s) for the imposition of punishment, it is the content of
narcotic drug or psychotropic substance which shall be taken into
consideration (see paragraphs 15 and 19).
75.    Disagreeing with the above view, another Division Bench of
the Supreme Court in Hira Singh (supra) referred inter alia the
following question for consideration by a Three Judge Bench:-
"Does the NDPS Act envisage that the mixture of
narcotic drug and seized material/substance should be
considered as a preparation in totality or on the basis of
the actual drug content of the specified narcotic drug?"
76.    Before the Three Judge Bench that ultimately decided the
reference in Hira Singh (supra), the Counsel for the accused
persons and the intervenor – Indian Drug Manufacturers'
Association, raised arguments substantially similar to those now
raised by Mr Merchant, Ms Collasso and Mr Poulekar before us.
All such arguments were considered and rejected by the Supreme
Court in Hira Singh (Supra). The ruling in Hira Singh (Supra)
refers to the Scheme of the NDPS Act in the context of narcotic
drugs and psychotropic substances. This is clear from the
discussion in paragraphs 6 and 10 of the said ruling. Therefore,
any attempt to limit this ruling to Heroin may be inappropriate.
77.     In paragraph 10.3 of Hira Singh (supra), the Court noted
that illicit drugs are seldom sold in a pure form. Instead, they are
almost always adulterated or cut with other substances. Therefore
there was no reasonable ground to focus only on the weight of the
pure drug or psychotropic substance instead of the weight of the
mixture of one or more drugs or substances and a neutral
material. The Court, therefore, approved the Legislature adopting
a market-oriented approach similar to the one adopted by
Congress in the United States. In addition, such a market-
oriented approach was evaluated and approved in Chapman
(supra), decided by the United States Supreme Court to consider
the combined weight of the L.S.D. on the blotter for graded
78.      Anuj Keshwani (supra), in paragraph 26, observes that
Chapman (supra) was relied upon by the Additional Solicitor
General of India in Hira Singh (supra); however, there is no
reference to Chapman (supra) while answering the reference. Mr
Merchant had also submitted that Chapman (supra) was merely
referred to in Hira Singh (supra) but not relied upon or followed.
However, the observations and the reasonings in paragraph 10.3
suggest that the three-Judge Bench adopted the reasoning in
Chapman (supra) in the precise context of L.S.D. This is another
indication that Hira Singh (supra) was not restricted only to the
narcotic drug heroin or that its ratio should not be extended to a
blotter impregnated with L.S.D.
79.    Therefore, the attempt to distinguish Hira Singh (supra) by
restricting its scope only to the narcotic drug "Heroin" or only to
narcotic drugs as defined under Section 2(xiv) and not extending
it to psychotropic substances in general and L.S.D. in particular,
cannot pass muster. Based on such a distinction, the binding
effect of the ratio decidendi in Hira Singh (supra) cannot be
whittled down or bypassed.
80.    Hitesh Malhotra (supra) has not held that Hira Singh
(supra) is distinguishable because it was concerned only with the
drug "Heroin". However, Hitesh Malhotra (supra) has held that
the papers containing dried L.S.D. drops of L.S.D. solution were
not a "mixture", and further, the blotter was not a " neutral
substance". Therefore, Hira Singh (supra) had no application in
the facts of the case.
81.    Again, with the utmost respect, we cannot agree with the
above reasoning or the distinguishing of Hira Singh (supra) based
upon the above reasoning. First, as noted earlier, there is no
discussion on why the paper containing dried L.S.D. drops of the
L.S.D. solution cannot be regarded as a mixture, particularly
when the NDPS Act provides no statutory definition of the
expression "mixture". Instead, the Act refers to a mixture in
whatever state. The Counsel for the accused persons, however,
contended that since there was no chemical fusion between the
L.S.D. and the blotter paper to give rise to some different
substance, L.S.D. impregnated in a blotter was not a mixture.
82.     The above contention overlooks that chemical fusion is not
essential in the context of a mixture. In a mixture, the mixed
elements retain their original properties. When two or more
substances are combined by physical methods in any proportion
and no new substance is formed, it is called a mixture. This is the
difference between a mixture and a compound. Mixtures can be
homogeneous or heterogeneous. For example, in a mixture of
heroin and chalk powder, it is not as if the Heroin is chemically
fused with chalk powder or loses its properties.
83.    Secondly, there is no discussion about why the blotter
cannot be regarded as a "neutral substance", particularly
considering the observations in Hira Singh (supra), not to
mention Chapman (supra) and Finch (supra). Mr Merchant had
fairly accepted that where a drug is in a capsule, the weight of the
capsule cannot be excluded. However, in the precise context of
L.S.D. impregnated blotter, Finch (Supra) holds that a much
closer analogy would be the non-drug content of a film coating or
a gelatin capsule used in producing lawful drugs as described by
the Full Federal Court in Sigma Pharmaceuticals (Australia) Ply
Ltd (supra). The Full Federal Court held that film coating or
gelatin capsule is an integral part of the ingestion by the user of
the drug. In the same way, the Court held that the cardboard
impregnated with L.S.D. was an integral part of the ingestion by
the user of the drug and thus a "preparation" or a "substance"
within the meaning of Section 4 of the Drug Misuse & Trading
84.    Besides, with the utmost respect, we find that the
conclusion about the blotter impregnated with L.S.D. not being
a mixture or about the blotter not being a neutral substance is not
backed by any reasoning. Moreover, the conclusion, with respect,
does not advert the scheme of the NDPS Act, both before and
after its amendment and before or after the issue of Notification
dated 19.10.2001 and the notes below the same. Therefore, based
on such a conclusion, we think the binding precedent in Hira
Singh (supra) could not have been distinguished or held as
inapplicable in the context of L.S.D. on a blotter.
85.    Most of the contentions now urged by the Counsel for the
accused persons, including the argument about Hira Singh
(supra) being restricted only to Heroin, were considered and ably
answered in Anuj Keshwani (supra). We endorse the reasoning.
The most relevant discussion is in paragraphs 29 and 30, and the
same is quoted below for the convenience of reference:
"29. Although, the drug which was considered by the Apex
Court in Hira Singh (supra) was "heroin", the principle
underlying the said conclusion will have to be considered
and borne in mind. Infact, the submissions advanced by
the learned Counsel for the Respondent No.1 with respect
to 'Note 4' in the Notification dated 18/11/2009 and the
Standing Order dated 19/10/2001, have been dealt with by
the Apex Court in Hira Singh (supra) and, hence need not
be adverted to again.
30. L.S.D. put on a blotter paper, is capable of being swal-
lowed, after placing it on the tongue. It is thus evident that
the blotter paper is capable of being swallowed and is used
as one of the methods for consuming L.S.D. Merely be-
cause the said blotter paper can be licked or put in a glass
of water, does not necessarily mean that the blotter paper
has to be excluded whilst determining the L.S.D. on the
blotter paper. Take for example, a capsule containing a drug
or a psychotropic substance. The said capsule is capable of
being opened and its contents, can either be consumed dir-
ectly or added to any other mixture/swallowed with the
cover. The fact remains that if a drug is put in a capsule,
the same will have to be weighed as a whole. It is important
to bear in mind the legislative intent, the object and
reasons, and, the preamble of the NDPS Act, whilst
considering, whether L.S.D. is to be weighed sans the
blotter paper. As noted in Hira Singh (supra), it was never
the intention of the Legislature to exclude the quantity of
the neutral substance and to consider only the actual
content by weight of the offending drug. It is also pertinent
to note that illicit drugs are seldom sold in a pure form.
They are always adulterated or cut with other substance or
put in a gelatin or blotter paper, as in the present case.
Heroin, for example, is capable of being mixed with other
substances like chalk powder, zinc oxide, because of these,
impurities in the drug, brown-sugar is cheaper but more
dangerous. The blotter paper impregnated or ingested with
L.S.D. is, in a sense, a dose. The blotter paper is made out
of an extra-absorbent material and generally includes in-
gredients such as rice, cotton and even flax seed, thus, mak-
ing it edible and as such, a substance in a dosage form/a
mixture for consumption. It is thus evident, that a blotter
paper, a carrier material, ingested with L.S.D., forms an
integral part of the ingestion by the user of the drug and
thus, constitutes preparation of the psychotropic substance
i.e. L.S.D., which is capable of being consumed, and as
such, forms a substance in a dosage form or a mixture.
Infact, at the first blush, one may ask 'how paper'?, but
once it is accepted that a blotter paper ingested/
impregnated with L.S.D., is used as a medium of
consumption, the same will squarely fall within the
definition of the term 'preparation', as defined in Section 2
(xx) of the NDPS Act. Like cutting agents used with other
drugs that are ingested, the blotter paper, gelatine capsules
or sugar cubes carrying L.S.D. can be and often is ingested
with the said drug. The object of the NDPS Act is to deal
with the street weight of the drug in the diluted form in
which they are sold and not only the weight of the active
component. Thus, having regard to the dictum of the Apex
Court in Hira Singh (supra), and the legislative intent of
the NDPS Act, the blotter paper impregnated or ingested
with L.S.D. will have to be considered as a whole, whilst
determining whether the quantity is a small or commercial
quantity."
86.   Most decisions or the material referred to also speak about
the blotter being made up of extra absorbent material, including
ingredients like rice, cotton, and flax seeds. Such blotters absorb
L.S.D. in their tiny perforations, separable only on dipping it into
a liquid or placing it on the tongue. The blotter becomes an
integral part of the mixture of the L.S.D.-impregnated blotter.
Moreover, blotters made up of rice, flax seeds etc., are
consumable. They qualify as neutral substances in ordinary
parlance, just as chalk or talcum powder would, in the context of
the drugs with which they are mixed. The ruling in Hira Singh
(Supra) is quite clear on the status of such neutral substances. The
NDPS Act also refers to psychotropic substances, including
preparations of one or more psychotropic substances. Preparation
includes a mixture in whatever state.
87.   Thus, the text, precedents and the literature on the market
or street practices in which L.S.D. is stored, transported,
concealed, sold, purchased, consumed or otherwise dealt with
support the discussion and construction in Anuj Keshwani
88.   Hira Singh (supra) notes that after the decision in E.
Micheal Raj (supra) by Notification dated 18.11.2009, "Note 4"
was added to the Notification dated 19.10.2001 specifying small
quantity and commercial quantity of the narcotic drugs or the
psychotropic substance covered under the NDPS Act. This Note
4 provides that the quantities shown in Columns 5 and 6 of the
Table relating to the respective drugs shown in Column 2 shall
apply to the entire mixture or any solution or any one or more
narcotic drugs or psychotropic substance of the particular drug in
dosage form or isomers, esters, ethers and salts or these drugs,
including salts or esters, ethers and isomers, wherever existence of
such substance is possible and not just its pure drug content.
89.   The Court noted that before its decision in E. Micheal Raj
(supra), the consistent view was that the weight of the entire
manufactured drug/preparation/mixture seized, including that of
the neutral substance, was required to be considered for
determining the small quantity or a commercial quantity.
However, it was for the first time in E. Micheal Raj (supra) that
the Division Bench took a contrary view to exclude the weight of
the neutral substance and consider only the weight of the pure
drug content.
90.   The three-judge Bench in Hira Singh (supra) disapproved
of the reasoning in E. Micheal Raj (supra). It held that the
Division Bench 'has not at all considered the relevant entry in the
Notification dated 19.10.2001. …. There is no specific finding
given by this Court that it would fall under entry 239, namely,
any mixture or preparation that of with or without the neutral
material. …...'. It further held that The Division Bench did not
even consider Note 2 of Notification dated 19.10.2001, which
provided that the quantities shown against the respective drugs
listed above also apply to the preparations of the drug and the
preparations of the substances of Note 1 above. If Note 2 had
been considered by the Division Bench, the conclusion might
have differed. The Court, therefore, disagreed with the view
taken in E. Micheal Raj (supra) on excluding the weight of the
neutral substance.
91.    The Court in Hira Singh (supra) also held that E. Micheal
Raj (supra) had not properly appreciated and/or considered
and/or properly construed the statement of objects and reasons
concerning the Amendment Act 2001. The Court held that the
Amendment Act of 2001 had provided a two-tier punishment,
one for small quantity and the other for commercial quantity.
From that, it could not be deduced that the Legislature intended
only to consider the actual content by weight of the offending
drug to determine whether it would constitute a small quantity or
commercial quantity.
92.    After quoting the Statement of Objects and Reasons
concerning the Amendment Act 2001, the Court observed that
on a bare reading of the same, it could not be said that the
Legislature intended to consider the actual content by weight of
the offending drug to determine whether it would constitute
small quantity or commercial quantity. The Court, therefore,
opined that the Division Bench, while holding that it is only the
actual content by weight of the offending drug to be considered
to determine whether it would constitute a small quantity or the
commercial quantity, the Division Bench has read more than
what was stated in the Statement of Objects and Reasons of the
93.   The Court, upon detailed consideration of the provisions of
the NDPS Act as amended from time to time and the Statement
of Objects and Reasons, held that neither the express provisions
nor the legislative intent favoured the exclusion of the weight of
the neutral substance to determine whether the mixture of the
narcotic drugs or psychotropic substances with one or more
neutral substance was of a small quantity or a commercial
quantity. This reasoning is found in paragraph 10, which includes
sub-paras 10.1 to 10.5.
94.   Note 4 below Notification dated 19.10.2001 as introduced
by Notification dated 18.11.2009 very clearly provides that
quantities shown in Columns 5 & 6 of the Table relating to the
respective drugs shown in Column 2 shall apply to the entire
mixture or any solution or any one or more narcotic drugs or
psychotropic substances of that particular drug in dosage form or
isomers, esters, ethers and salts of these drugs, including salts or
esters, ethers and isomers, wherever existence of such substance is
possible and not just its pure drug content.
95.    Thus, this Note clearly expresses that the weight of the
entire mixture is relevant, not just the pure drug content in such
mixture. The Legislature is presumed to be aware of the market or
street conditions in which psychotropic substance like L.S.D. is
dealt with on the streets and in the markets. The accused persons
have not challenged any provisions of the NDPS Act or Note 4
below the Notification dated 19.10.2001. In any case, the validity
of these provisions has already been upheld in Hira Singh (supra).
Therefore, any reference to this Note could not have been avoided
by opining that L.S.D. drops on a blotter do not constitute a
mixture or that a blotter is not a neutral substance.
96.    Incidentally, Hira Singh (supra), in paragraph 11, holds
that Note 4 below Notification dated 19.10.2001 was
clarificatory and added by way of abundant caution only. Even
absent the Note, the Court concluded that while determining the
small or commercial quantity in relation to narcotic drugs or
psychotropic substances in a mixture with one or more neutral
substance(s), it includes the weight of the neutral substance(s)
also and not only the actual content by weight of the offending
drug has to be taken into account. The Court held that
theretofore even if Note 4, which was added by Notification
dated 18.11.2009, were not to be added, the legal position would
favour taking into consideration the combined weight of the
offending drug and the neutral substance with which it is mixed.
97.    Thus, according to us, Hira Singh (supra) is a complete
answer to most of the contentions raised by Mr Merchant, Ms
Collasso and Mr Poulekar on behalf of the accused persons. Based
upon Hira Singh (supra), therefore, their contentions cannot be
accepted by us.
98.    The arguments based on the Convention and the
consequent inapplicability of the United States or Australian
rulings are also unacceptable. The law in the United States of
America or Australia is certainly neither applicable nor binding in
India. But the contention about such a law being at a tangent to
the law in India is rather extreme. The Statutory scheme in the
two countries also favours the inclusion of the weight of the
carrier medium or the blotter in the case of L.S.D to determine
punishment. At least in the United States, the expression
"mixture" was not defined in the Statute. The same is the position
under the NDPS Act. No significant distinctions about the
market or street practices concerning storage, transport,
concealing, selling, purchasing, or consumption were pointed out.
99.     In fact, the Statutory scheme and provisions of the NDPS
Act are pretty clear and clearly reflect the legislative intent on the
subject. They are comparable, at least when it comes to the
essentials. There is no doubt, however, that the precedents from
the United States or Australia do not bind the Courts in India.
Neither the Supreme Court in Hira Singh (Supra) nor this Court
in Anuj Keshwani (Supra) say so. But they have a persuasive value
considering the statutory schemes and the market practices. In the
context of L.S.D. on a blotter, which appears to be a worldwide
mode of dealing with L.S.D., such precedents are certainly not
irrelevant. Even though they may not be binding, they have a
persuasive value.
100. The contentions by the Counsel for the accused persons
about the interpretation of the definition clauses or the entries
and notes in the Notifications issued under the NDPS Act have
been answered in Hira Singh (Supra). The Notification dated
19.10.2001 has been explained in Hira Singh (supra) in
paragraph 10.2, which reads as follows:
"10.2 ..... However, in the case of mixture of the narcotic
drugs/psychotropic drugs mentioned in column no.2 and
any mixture or preparation that of with or without the
neutral material of any of the drugs mentioned in Table,
lesser of the small quantity between the quantities given
against the respective Narcotic Drugs or Psychotropic
Substances forming part of mixture and lesser of
commercial quantity between the quantities given against
the respective narcotic drugs or psychotropic substance
forming part of the mixture is to be taken into
consideration. As per example, mixture of 100 gm is seized
and the mixture is consisting of two different Narcotic
Drugs and Psychotropic Substance with neutral material,
one drug is Heroin and another is methadone, lesser of
commercial quantity between the quantities given against
the aforesaid two respective Narcotic Drugs and
Psychotropic Substance is required to be considered. For
the purpose of determination of the "small quantity or
commercial quantity", in case of entry 239 the entire
weight of the mixture/drug by whatever named called
weight of neutral material is also required to be considered
subject to what is stated herein above. If the view taken by
this Court in the case of E. Micheal Raj (Supra) is
accepted, in that case, it would be adding something to the
relevant provisions of the Statute which is not there and/or
it was never intended by the Legislature."
101. The contention based on the definition of the expression
"preparation" using the term "such drugs or substances" or the
argument about the interpretation of entry 239 in Notification
dated 19.10.2001, as now raised by Mr Merchant, was explicitly
negatived in Hira Singh (supra) while interpreting the statutory
provisions and the precise entry 239 in Notification dated
102. There is no dispute that the expression "mixture" has not
been defined under the NDPS Act. The same was the position
before the United States Supreme Court in Chapman (supra).
The Counsel for the accused persons presented arguments similar
to those raised in Chapman (Supra). However, the majority (7:2)
rejected such arguments in the following terms:
"14. We think that the blotter paper used in this case, and
blotter paper customarily used to distribute L.S.D., is a
"mixture or substance containing a detectable amount" of
LSD. In so holding, we confirm the unanimous conclusion
of the Courts of Appeals that have addressed the issue.
Neither the Statute nor the Sentencing Guidelines define
the terms "mixture" and "substance," nor do they have any
established common law meaning. Those terms, therefore,
must be given their ordinary meaning. See Moskal v.
112 L.Ed.2d 449 (1990). A "mixture" is defined to include
"a portion of matter consisting of two or more components
that do not bear a fixed proportion to one another and that
however thoroughly commingled are regarded as retaining
a separate existence." Webster's Third New International
Dictionary 1449 (1986). A "mixture" may also consist of
two substances blended together so that the particles of one
are diffused among the particles of the other. 9 Oxford
English Dictionary 921 (2d ed.1989). L.S.D. is applied to
blotter paper in a solvent, which is absorbed into the paper
and ultimately evaporates. After the solvent evaporates, the
L.S.D. is left behind in a form that can be said to "mix"
with the paper. The L.S.D. crystals are inside of the paper,
so that they are commingled with it, but the L.S.D. does
not chemically combine with the paper. Thus, it retains a
separate existence and can be released by dropping the
paper into a liquid, or by swallowing the paper itself. The
L.S.D. is diffused among the fibers of the paper. Like
Heroin or cocaine mixed with cutting agents, the L.S.D.
cannot be distinguished from the blotter paper, nor easily
separated from it. Like cutting agents used with other drugs
that are ingested, the blotter paper, gel, or sugar cube
carrying L.S.D. can be and often is ingested with the
drug."
103. The Majority in Chapman (supra) refused to accept the
contentions that dictionary meaning should not be adopted
because then even the weight of the vial or an automobile in
which the drugs are being transported would have to be taken
into account, rendering the process nonsensical. The Majority
held that the term "mixture" does not include L.S.D. in a bottle
or L.S.D. in a car because the drug is easily distinguished from
and separated from such a "container". The drug is clearly not
mixed with a glass vial or automobile, nor has the drug chemically
bonded with the vial or car. It may be true that the weights of
containers and packaging materials generally are not included in
determining a sentence for drug distribution, but that is because
those items are also clearly not mixed or otherwise combined with
the drug.
104. The Majority in Chapman (supra) also rejected the
arguments based upon discrimination and unconstitutionality.
The Majority held that the Statute and the Sentencing Guidelines
increase the penalty for persons who possess large quantities of
drugs, regardless of their purity. That is a rational sentencing
scheme. This is as true with respect to L.S.D. as it is with respect
to other drugs. Although L.S.D. is not sold by weight but by
dose, and a carrier medium is not, strictly speaking, used to
"dilute" the drug, that medium is used to facilitate the
distribution of the drug. Blotter paper makes L.S.D. easier to
transport, store, conceal, and sell. It is a tool of the trade for those
who traffic the drug; therefore, it was rational for Congress to set
penalties based on this chosen tool. Congress was also justified in
avoiding arguments about the accurate weight of pure drugs that
might have been extracted from blotter paper had it chosen to
calibrate sentences according to that weight. Nevertheless, the
Court held that blotter paper seems to be the carrier of choice,
and the vast majority of cases will therefore do exactly what the
sentencing scheme was designed to do – punish those who deal in
larger amounts of drugs more heavily.
105. Thus, in Chapman (supra), the Court supported its
conclusion by approving the market-oriented approach adopted
by Congress to punish drug trafficking, under which the total
quantity of what is distributed rather than the amount of the pure
drug involved, was used to determine the length of the sentence.
Congress did not want to punish retail traffickers less severely,
even though they deal in smaller quantities of the pure drug
because such traffickers keep the street markets going.
106. The Court also held that L.S.D. applied to a blotter paper
was, in fact, a "mixture or substance". Noting that neither the
Statute nor the Sentencing Guidelines defined "mixture or
substance", the Court adopted the dictionary meaning of
"mixture". The mixture was defined as matter consisting of two
or more substances that are so thoroughly blended together that
the particles of one are diffused among the particles of the other
but nonetheless maintain a separate existence.
107. The Court applied its definition of "mixture" to blotter
paper and L.S.D. as follows:
"The L.S.D. Crystals are [diffused among the fibers of
paper], so that they are commingled with it, but the L.S.D.
does not chemically combine with the paper. Thus, it
retains a separate existence.... Like Heroin or cocaine mixed
with cutting agents, the L.S.D. cannot be distinguished
from the blotter paper, nor easily separated from it. Like
cutting agents used with other drugs that are ingested, the
blotter paper, gel, or sugar cube carrying L.S.D. can be
...ingested with the drug."
108. In Finch (supra), the Court of Criminal Appeal for New
South Wales rejected similar contentions. It held that the
cardboard impregnated with L.S.D was not analogous to a
container or a syringe from which the user extracted a drug. A
much closer analogy would be the non-drug content of a film
coating or a gelatin capsule used in producing lawful drugs as
described by the Full Federal Court in Sigma Pharmaceuticals
(Australia) Pty Ltd. (supra). The Federal Court held that film
coating or gelatin capsules are an integral part of the ingestion by
the user of the drug. In the same way here, the cardboard
impregnated with L.S.D. was an integral part of the ingestion by
the user of the drug and thus a "preparation" or a "substance"
within the meaning of Section 4 that dealt with "admixtures".
109. The contention based on discrimination has been
adequately answered in Hira Singh (supra) and Chapman (supra).
Besides, as was pointed out by Mr Bhobe, L.S.D. is not the kind
of psychotropic substance that can, subject to specified
conditions, be used after obtaining necessary licences in
pharmaceuticals or other purposes. Moreover, there is no dispute
that possessing or using L.S.D. is completely banned in India.
Therefore, there is nothing wrong with our Legislature also
adopting a market-oriented approach and requiring consideration
of the weight of the entire preparation or the mixture and not just
the pure L.S.D. content when determining small or commercial
110. Mr Merchant submitted that penal statutes like the NDPS
Act must be strictly construed. He proposed that if two
interpretations are possible, the interpretation that benefits the
accused persons must be adopted. Further, he submitted that
statutes like NDPS must be literally construed and liberally
111. Again, all these contentions have been adequately dealt
with in Hira Singh (supra). In particular, reference can be made
to the discussion in paragraphs 10.1 and 10.2 on the issue of
interpretation. In any case, even the literal interpretation of the
provisions of the NDPS Act and the Notifications dated
19.10.2001, 18.11.2009 and the Notes below the same support
the view taken in Anuj Keshwai (supra). As noted earlier, the
statutory provisions and the legislative intent, so to say, speak
with one voice. Therefore the view we propose to endorse is
backed by the letter and spirit of the NDPS Act. The binding and
persuasive precedents on the subject also overwhelmingly support
such a view.
112. In addition to the statutory provisions and schemes,
reference is necessary to the Statement of Objects and Reasons of
the Amendment Act 16 of 2014. This provides that the 2001
Amendment seeks to clarify the legislative intent to take the entire
quantity of the drug seized in a case for determining the quantum
of punishment and not the pure drug content. Thus, this is where
the statutory provisions and the legislative intent align.
Accordingly, this matter has no literal or liberal interpretation
issue as was attempted to be raised.
113. For all the above reasons, we hold that a blotter paper forms
an integral part of the L.S.D. (drug) when put on it for
consumption and, as such, the weight of the blotter paper
containing L.S.D. will have to be considered for determining a
small or commercial quantity of the offending drug under the
NDPS Act, 1985. Further, we also hold that the blotter paper
that carries the drug (L.S.D. drops), which facilitates its
consumption as a whole, is a preparation, mixture, or neutral
substance within the meaning of the NDPS Act 1985.
114.    Since the referral order refers to L.S.D. as a drug, we have
continued to adopt that term when answering the two questions
referred to. However, in terms of Section 2 (xxiii) of the
NDPS Act, there is no dispute that L.S.D. will have to be
classified as a psychotropic substance and not a drug.
115. In conclusion, therefore, we endorse the view taken in Anuj
Keshwani (supra) that the combined weight of the L.S.D. and the
blotter is relevant to determine small or commercial quantities
and not the view in Hitesh Malhotra (supra) and Harsh Meshram
(supra) that only the weight of the pure L.S.D. is the
determinative factor. The reference is answered accordingly.
116. The matter may now be placed before the learned Single
Judge taking up Criminal Application (Bail) No.752/2021(F) at
the earliest for consideration of the bail application.
