The police after investigation submitted a charge sheet for
the offences punishable under Sections 417, 376, 313, 341, 354,
509, 506 read with Section 34 of IPC and Section 3(1)(xi) of SC
and ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989 alleging that the
petitioner - accused No.1 by promising to marry CW1 had sexual
intercourse with CW1 and when she was pregnant, she was
forced to terminate the pregnancy at the instance of accused
2.    The learned Sessions Judge took the cognizance of
the aforesaid offences and issued process to the petitioner -
accused No.1.     Taking exception to the same, this petition is
3.    I have examined the submissions of the learned
counsel for the parties.
4.    A FIR was lodged by the 2nd respondent alleging
that two years prior to the lodging of FIR, the petitioner -
accused No.1 and CW1 were in love with each other and the
accused No.1 forcibly had sexual intercourse with CW1 and when
she was pregnant, the petitioner - accused No.1 forced her to
terminate the pregnancy.     It was further alleged that after
having sexual intercourse with CW1 on three to four occasions,
the petitioner - accused No.1 started to avoid her and on
22.7.2017 she attempted to commit suicide. Since the petitioner
- accused No.1 came to the hospital and promised to marry
CW1, CW1 did not lodge FIR against the petitioner - accused
No.1. Thereafter, his friends i.e. other accused threatened her
and outraged her modesty.         The police after investigation
submitted a charge sheet for the aforesaid offences.
5.    The Apex Court in the case of Sonu @ Subhash
Kumar -vs- State of Uttar Pradesh and another reported in 2021
SCC Online SC 181 by referring to the decision in the case of
Pramod Suryabhan Pawar -vs- State of Maharashtra reported in
(2019) 9 SCC 608 at para-11 has held that in the absence of
allegation that promise to marry was false promise at the
inception, the false promise itself must be of immediate
relevance or bear a direct nexus to the woman's decision to
engage in the sexual act.        In the present case, there is no
allegation that promise made to the 2nd respondent was false at
the inception. Charge sheet material does not disclose that the
petitioner by using force or by assaulting has outraged the
modesty of the victim so as to constitute the offence punishable
under Section 3(1)(xi) of Atrocities Act. Hence, in the absence of
any essential ingredients so as to constitute the offences alleged
against the petitioner- accused No.1, the filing of charge sheet
against the petitioner - accused no.1 is without any substance.
Accordingly, I pass the following:
ii)   The impugned proceeding in SC No.282/2018
pending on the file of the CCH-17, City Court Complex,
Bangalore City, insofar as it relates to accused No.1 is hereby
