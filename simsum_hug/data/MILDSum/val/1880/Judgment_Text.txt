Petitioner has called in question the validity of the
proceedings   in  C.C.No.17286/2022     registered for  the
offences punishable under Sections 171-F and 171-C of IPC
and Section 125 of the Representation of People Act, 1951.
2.    The information that was made out to the police
authorities was to the effect that on 02.12.2019 in front of
Priya Darshini Hotel, there was a meeting and in which
certain statements were made by the petitioner which
constitute violation of law as amounting to influencing the
electorate on the basis of caste and religion. After the
information was made out to the police authorities, a
requisition was made to the Magistrate by the police
authorities requesting for permission to investigate. Upon
such request, the Magistrate has endorsed as follows:
"Perused    the  requisition.  As   the  materials
disclose   commission    of   NC  offence, IO   is
permitted to investigate the matter."
3.    It is contended that such endorsement is not a
proper procedure to be followed in light of the guidelines
made in the case of Vaggeppa Gurulinga Jangaligi
(Jangalagi) vs. The State of Karnataka - ILR 2020
KAR 630 which is a re-statement of the correct procedure
to be followed and on this score alone, proceedings are
required to be set aside. It is also contended that the act of
granting permission to investigate a non-cognizable offence
must be with due application of mind and that would
become clear from the guideline No.IV in paragraph No.20
of the above referred judgment.
4.    It is noticed that the requisition before the Court
made by the Police Authorities contains an endorsement on
the requisition itself. Such endorsement doest not amount
to a judicial order and proper procedure to be followed in
terms of the direction passed in Paragraph No.20 at (ii) in
the case of Vaggeppa (supra). Guidelines laid down
regarding the procedure to be followed in paragraph No.20
of the above said judgment reads as follows:
"i)  The    Jurisdictional  Magistrates  shall stop
hereafter making endorsement as 'permitted' on
the    police     requisition   itself.  Such    an
endorsement is not an order in the eyes of law
and as mandated under Section 155(2) of
ii) When the requisition is submitted by the
informant to the Jurisdictional Magistrate, he
should make an endorsement on it as to how it
was received, either by post or by Muddam and
direct the office to place it before him with a
separate order sheet. No order should be passed
on the requisition itself. The said order sheet
should be continued for further proceedings in
the case.
iii) When the requisition is submitted to the
Jurisdictional Magistrate, he has to first examine
whether the SHO of the police station has
referred    the   informant    to  him   with  such
iv) The Jurisdictional Magistrate should examine
the contents of the requisition with his/her
judicious mind and record finding as to whether
it is a fit case to be investigated, if the
Magistrate finds that it is not a fit case to
investigate, he/she shall reject the prayer made
in the requisition. Only after his/her subjective
satisfaction that there is a ground to permit the
police officer to take up the investigation, he/she
shall record a finding to that effect permitting
the   police   officer  to   investigate  the  non-
cognizable offence.
v) In case the Magistrate passes the orders
permitting the investigation, he/she shall specify
the rank and designation of the Police Officer
who has to investigate the case, who shall be
other than informant or the complainant."
5.    It is clear that in terms of the guidelines at (ii),
the Court is directed to place a separate order sheet and the
order regarding requisition must be made in the order
sheet, which must be a part of the proceedings before the
Court. Noticing that the said procedure is not followed, the
proceedings before the Magistrate is liable to be quashed.
6.    Accordingly,      the     proceedings    in   C.C.
No.17286/2022 is quashed and the matter is restored to the
stage of the informant having appeared before the police
authorities. It is for the complainant to pursue further
proceedings and if the proceedings are pursued further,
needless to state that in terms of the mandate under
Section   155     of  Cr.P.C.   while   taking permission   for
investigation of non-cognizable offence, the informant must
be referred to the Magistrate. If permission is to be granted,
it is open for the Magistrate to either grant or not grant
permission and as specified in guideline (iv) as extracted
above, it is for the magistrate to apply his mind and see
whether it is a case to be investigated. While reserving such
power, the matter is remitted back. All contentions of the
petitioner are kept open.
7.    Writ petition is disposed off. The assistance of
Sri.   Sandesh    J.   Chouta,   learned  amicus   curiae   is
appreciated and the said appreciation is placed on record.
