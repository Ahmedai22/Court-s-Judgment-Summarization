This Crl.A has been filed against the order in O.P.
(Adoption). No. 75/2016 dated 15.03.2016 of District Court,
Kollam. According to the learned counsel for the appellant,
respondents 2 and 3 are husband and wife. The 2nd respondent is
the brother of the 2nd appellant and 3rd respondent is the wife of
the 2nd respondent.   The respondents 2 and 3 are the biological
parents of Kumari, Maria Johnson aged 8 years old, who is the
4th girl child of the said couple. The appellants are childless
couple; both of them had undergone treatment for infertility for a
long period. Doctors confirmed that it will not be possible for
the appellants to become biological parent of a child. The 2 nd
appellant had to undergo uterus removal surgery.           Hence, at
present there is no chance for the 2 nd appellant getting conceived.
Kumari. Maria Johnson is the 4th girl child of the respondents 2
and 3.      whileso, the respondents 2 and 3 expressed their
willingness to give in adoption of Kumari. Maria Johnson to the
appellants. Hence, with a view to legalize the entire proceedings,
O.P.(Adoption) No. 75/2016 has been filed by the appellants
before the District Judge, Kollam. By the impugned order, the
learned District Judge dismissed their O.P., finding that the court
has no jurisdiction to entertain or adjudicate the issue of adoption
mooted by the appellants and aggrieved by the same appellants
approach this Court.
2.     The learned counsel for the appellants drew my
attention to various provisions of the Juvenile Justice (Care and
Protection of Children) Act, 2015, the Juvenile Justice (Care and
Protection of Children) Rules, 2014 and Adoption Regulations,
3.     Heard both sides. Section 2(2) of the Juvenile Justice
(Care and Protection of Children) , 2015 reads as follows:
“'adoption' means the process through which the adopted child is
permanently separated from his biological parents and becomes the lawful child
of his adoptive parents with all the rights, privileges and responsibilities that are
attached to a biological child.”
4.     Section 2(23) of the Juvenile Justice (Care and
Protection of Children) Act, 2015 reads as follows:
“Court' means a Civil Court, which has jurisdiction in matters of
adoption and guardianship and may include the District Court, Family Court and
5.      Section 2(52) of the Juvenile Justice (Care and
Protection of Children) Act, 2015 reads as follows:
“ 'relative', in relation to a child for the purpose of adoption under this
Act, means a paternal uncle or aunt, or a maternal uncle or aunt, or paternal
grandparent or maternal grandparent.”
6.      According to the learned counsel for the appellants,
being the brother's child of the 2 nd appellant, the child supposed
to be adopted will come within the definition of 'relative' defined
under Section 2(52) of the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection
of Children) Act, 2015. Section 56(2) is also relevant which
“Adoption of a child from a relative by another relative, irrespective of
their religion, can be made as per the provisions of this Act and the adoption
regulations framed by the Authority.”
7.      Next the learned counsel drew my attention to
Section 101(5) of the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of
Children) Act, 2015 (in short the Act) which deals with the
“Any person aggrieved by an order of the Children's Court may file an
appeal before the High Court in accordance with the procedure specified in the
Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (2 of 1974)”
8.      So this is the proper forum for entertaining an appeal
against the impugned order.                The learned counsel drew my
attention to the provisions of the Juvenile Justice (Care and
Protection of Children) Rules, 2014 ( In short the rules). Rule
40(2) of the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children)
“For all matters relating to adoption, these rules and guidelines issued
from time to time by the State Government and notified by the State Government
shall apply. In the absence of such rules the guidelines issued by the Central
Adoption Resource Agency and notified by the Central Government under sub-
section (3) of Section 41 of the Act shall apply.”
9.      Rule 41(C) of the              Juvenile Justice (Care and
Protection of Children) Rules, 2014 deals with the procedure for
“The specialised Adoption Agency along with the prospective adoptive
parent(s) shall file a petition in the Court having jurisdiction for obtaining the
necessary adoption orders under the Act and these Rules within ten days from the
acceptance of referral by prospective adoptive parent(s) and shall take necessary
steps to get the process of legal adoption completed at the earliest.”
10.     The learned counsel also drew my attention to the
Adoption Regulations, 2017.                    Regulation 4 of Adoption
Regulations, 2017 deals with child eligible for adoption reads as
The following shall be eligible for adoption, namely:-
“(a) any orphan or abandoned or surrendered child, declared legally free
for adoption by the Child Welfare Committee;
(b) A child of a relative defined under sub-section (52) of Section 2 of the
(c) child or children of spouse from earlier marriage, surrendered by the
biological parent(s) for adoption by the step-parent.”
11.      Regulation 5(7) of Adoption Regulations, 2017 reads
“ The age criteria for prospective adoptive parents shall not be applicable
in case of relative adoptions and adoption by step-parent.”
12.      The learned counsel further drew my attention to
Regulation 55 Adoption Regulations, 2017 reads as follows:
“ Legal procedure:-    1)The      prospective     adoptive
parents, who intend to adopt the child of a relative as defined in
sub-section (52) of Section 2 of the Act, shall file an application
in the competent Court under sub-section 2 of Section 56 of sub-
section (1) of Section 60 of the Act in case of in-country relative
adoption or inter-country relative adoption, respectively,
alongwith a consent letter of the biological parents as provided
in Schedule XIX and all other documents as provided in
2)      The biological parent and the step-parent, who
intend to adopt the child or children of the biological parent,
shall file the adoption application as provided in Schedule
XXXII, in the Court concerned of the district where they reside,
along with consent letter of the biological parents and the step-
parent adopting the child or children, as provided in the
Schedule XX and all other documents as provided in Schedule
3)       The prospective adoptive parents, in case of
inter-country relative adoption, shall file the adoption
application in the Court concerned of the district, where the
child resides with biological parents or guardians as provided in
4)       The prospective adoptive parents shall file an
application in Family Court or District Court or City Civil
Court, as the case may be.
5)       Before issuing an adoption order, the Court shall
satisfy itself of the various conditions stipulated under Section
61 of the Act, and Regulations 51 to 56, as the case may be.
6)       The prospective adoptive parents shall obtain a
certified copy of the adoption order from the Court and furnish
a copy of the same to the District Child Protection Unit for
online submission to the Authority.”
13.     The learned counsel also drew my attention to
Section 27 which is deals with the Child Welfare Committee.
“27(1) The state Government shall by notification in the official gazette
constitute for every district, one or more Child Welfare Committees for exercising
the powers and to discharge the duties conferred on such Committees in relation
to children in need of care and protection under this Act and ensure that
induction training and sensitisation of all members of the committee is provided
within two months from the date of notification.”
14.    The learned counsel further takes my attention to
Section 2(14) (iii) of the Act read as follows:
“child in need of care and protection” means a child:-
iii)    who resides with a person (whether a graurdian of the child or not) and
a)     has injured, exploited, abused or neglected the child or has
violated any other law for the time being in force meant for the protection of
b)     has threatened to kill, injure, exploit or abuse the child and there
is a reasonable likelihood of the threat being carried out; or
c)     has killed, abused, neglected or exploited some other child or
children and there is a reasonable likelihood of the child in question being killed,
abused, exploited or neglected by that person; or....”
15.    The child in question belonged to respondents 2 and
3 and will not come under any of the categories described in
clause 14.
16.    In the present case, petitioners are relatives as
provided under Section 2(52) of the Act and the forum for filing
the petition for adoption as per Section 2(23) of the Act include,
District Court, Family Court and City Civil Court. 1 st appellant is
aged 57 years old and the 2 nd appellant is aged 47 years old.
Since the petitioners are relatives, the age bar as prescribed under
the Act will not be applicable under the Regulation 5(7).
17.   Appellants have no child       inspite of undergoing
various procedures, the doctors certified that there is no chance
for conceivement by the 2nd appellant and her uterus is also
removed and the 2nd respondent is the brother of the 2 nd appellant.
So they come within the definition of 'relatives' as prescribed
under Section 2(52) of the Act. As pers law, procedures and the
rules above prescribed, the appellants are eligible to adopt a
child, who is the 4th girl child of respondents 2 and 3. The
respondents have no objection and have filed a consent letter
too. In the said circumstance, the finding of the learned District
Judge that the court is not a proper forum and they have to
approach the Child Welfare Committee is illegal and perverse.
18.   Presently the Family Courts are designated as
Adoption Court as per O.M. No. D12-10890/2016 of the High
Court of Kerala.         According to the learned counsel, the
jurisdictional court with respect to the present adoption is Family
In the result, the impugned order passed by the District
Judge, Kollam is set aside and appeal allowed. The District
Court, Kollam is directed to return the records to the petitioners
for presentation before the proper court.     Sd/-
