Opposite Party :- State of U.P. and Another
Counsel for Revisionist :- Raghawendra Kumar Singh
Counsel for Opposite Party :- G.A.
The present revision has been preferred with a prayer to
allow this revision and quash/set aside the order dated
26.04.2022 passed by learned Additional Sessions Judge-14,
Aligarh in Sessions Trial No.942 of 2022 (State of U.P. Vs.
Gaurav @ Govind) arising out of Case Crime No.74 of 2021,
2.     Portal/Pointsman,    Mukesh     Kumar     and    Deputy
Superintendent of Police, Hathras Railway Station were
informed on 26.10.2021 about unidentified dead body laid
down near platform no.2, up line to the out post of the G.R.P.
Hathras Junction. The inquest was conducted on the body of
the deceased on 26.10.2021 and Panchnama was prepared
and thereafter the postmortem was also conducted on
26.10.2021, which indicates that the deceased died due to
shock and haemorrhage as a result of antemortem injury.
3.     The family members of the deceased reached at the
place of occurrence, where inquest was prepared by the
concerned police station. The report was registered under
Section 174(1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure. After
conducting Panchnama, postmortem report and detailed
accident report were submitted on 26.10.2021. The brother of
deceased, lodged a report on 28.10.2021 mentioning therein
that he had come to Aligarh on 28.10.2021 to take postmortem
report and while he was sitting in waiting room of Aligarh
Railway Station, he heard from one Omjeet @ Chhotu, son of
Kishori Lal that he was sitting in General Bogie of Unchahar
Express from Fafund Railway Station on 25.10.2021, which
was going to Chandigarh, one Gaurav @ Govind, a Mechanic
of Bike met him in the train, after sometime, there was quarrel
at Hathras Railway Station between a boy (deceased) and
Gaurav and the boy was thrown from the train by accused.
4.    The first information report was lodged on 28.10.2021,
under Section 302 I.P.C. at G.R.P. Aligarh Junction, Aligarh.
The    investigation  was     conducted    and   statement   of
complainant as well as other witnesses was recorded under
Section 161 Cr.P.C. and charge sheet was filed against the
applicant on 20.12.2021 before the Additional Chief Judicial
Magistrate, Aligarh, under Section 302 I.P.C. The cognizance
was taken and charges were framed.
5.    The applicant has challenged the charge sheet dated
26.04.2022, framed by Additional District and Sessions Judge-
6.    It has been submitted by Sri Yogendra Singh, learned
counsel for the revisionist that there are two F.I.Rs. in the
present case and two investigations were carried out by the
Police but no police report under Section 173(2) Cr.P.C. has
been submitted before Chief Judicial Magistrate with respect to
the information and the charges have been framed in
pursuance of the second F.I.R., which is not legally
sustainable. He has submitted that for the same cause of
action, it is the second F.I.R., therefore, proceeding initiated for
framing the charge dated 26.04.2022 by the Additional District
and Sessions Judge, Aligarh, is bad in the eyes of law and
according to his submission investigation of second F.I.R. is
bad in the eyes of law, whereas, the first report should be
taken into consideration. He has further submitted that the
materials collected under Section 302 I.P.C. against the
applicant, is based on hearsay witness. He has relied upon the
judgment passed by High Court of Madras (Madurai Bench) in
the case of Manohari Vs. The District Superintendent of Police
reported in 2018 (2) LW (Cri) 522, Rhea Chakraborty Vs. State
of Bihar and others reported in 2020 (0) SC 490 and Radha
Mohan Singh @ Lal Saheb and others Vs. State of U.P.
reported in 2006 (2) SCC 450.
7.    On the other hand, Sri Rupak Chaubey, learned A.G.A.
for the State-opposite party has opposed and submitted that
there is only one F.I.R., which was registered on 28.10.2021,
as Case Crime No.74 of 2021, under Section 302 I.P.C., Police
information tendered by Portal/Pointsman, Mukesh Kumar and
police authority dated 26.10.2021 that an unknown dead body
was lying near railway line, cannot be termed as F.I.R. and
therefore, the police authority has rightly chosen not to lodge
the F.I.R. upon receiving such information. He has further
submitted that the preparation of inquest report under Section
174 Cr.P.C. regarding the death of deceased, postmortem
examination and detailed accident report were, in fact, in the
nature of inquiry and it cannot be equated with the
investigation contemplated under Section 157 Cr.P.C. which
commenced after lodging of F.I.R. under Section 154 Cr.P.C.
Moreover, this aspect cannot be considered when the trial has
been commenced and charges have been framed and trial
court bring the evidence on the basis of material on record.
There is ground for presuming that the accused has committed
an offence and the Court framed the charge even strong
suspension based on material on record.
8.     Sri Rupak Chaubey, learned A.G.A. has further submitted
that there is statement under Section 161 Cr.P.C. of witness,
namely, Omjeet @ Chhotu, who had stated that he himself had
witnessed the incident, wherein, it is mentioned that the
revisionist had pushed out the deceased from running train
which resulted homicidal death of the deceased. The
statement of other witnesses recorded in the investigation also
support this allegation.
9.     Heard Sri Yogendra Singh, learned counsel for the
revisionist and Sri Rupak Chaubey, learned A.G.A. for the
State-opposite party.
10.    Section 154 Cr.P.C. deals with information in cognizable
offence for lodging F.I.R. Section 154 Cr.P.C. which stipulates
that there must be an information relating to the commission of
cognizable offence and the information can be termed as
F.I.R., there is particular condition in respect of F.I.R. that there
must be information of cognizable offence. When the
Portal/Pointsman, Mukesh Kumar, Railway Authority, informed
the Police regarding lying of a dead body near railwayline, it
does not disclose commission of any cognizable offence.
Therefore, the said information entered in G.D. cannot termed
as F.I.R. The inquest was conducted in terms of Section 174
Cr.P.C. and police had rightly chosen not to lodge any F.I.R. on
such information. The said view is enunciated in the Judgment
passed by Hon’ble Supreme Court in the case of Patai alias
Krishna Kumar Vs. State of Uttar Pradesh reported in (2010) 4
SCC 429. Paragraph No.16 of the said judgment is relevant
and is quoted below:-
“16. In order for a message or omunication to be
qualified to be a first information report, there must
be something in the nature of a complaint or
accusation or at least some information of the crime
given with the object of settting the police or
criminal law into motion. It is true that a first
information report need not contain the minutest
details as to how the offence had taken place nor it
is required to contain the names of the offenders or
the witnesses. But it must at least contain some
information about the crime committed as also
some information about the manner in which the
cognizable offence has been committed. A cryptic
message recording an occurrence cannot be
termed as a first information report.”
11.    Hon’ble Supreme Court has held that the proceeding
under Section 174 Cr.P.C. is for the purpose of discovering the
cause of death, and the evidence taken was very short. When
the body cannot be found or has been buried, there can be no
investigation under Section 174 Cr.P.C. The scrutiny done
under Section 174 Cr.P.C. cannot be equated with the
information under Section 154 Cr.P.C. which is meant for
cognizable offence. Inquiry under Section 174 Cr.P.C. is more
12.   The case of inquiry under Section 174 and 154 is
considered in case of Manoj Kumar Sharma and others Vs.
State of Chhattisgarh and another reported in (2016) 9 SCC 1.
Paragraph nos.19, 20, 21 and 22 of the said judgment are
relevant, which are quoted below:-
“19. The proceedings under Section 174 have a
very limited scope. The object of the proceedings is
merely to ascertain whether a person has died
under suspicious circumstances or an unnatural
death and if so what is the apparent cause of the
death. The question regarding the details as to how
the deceased was assaulted or who assaulted him
or under what circumstances he was assaulted is
foreign to the ambit and scope of the proceedings
under Section 174 of the Code. Neither in practice
nor in law was it necessary for the police to mention
those details in the inquest report. It is, therefore,
not necessary to enter all the details of the overt
acts in the inquest report. The procedure under
Section 174 is for the purpose of discovering the
cause of death, and the evidence taken was very
short. When the body cannot be found or has been
buried, there can be no investigation under Section
174. This section is intended to apply to cases in
which an inquest is necessary. The proceedings
under this section should be kept more distinct from
the proceedings taken on the complaint. Whereas
the starting point of the powers of the police was
changed from the power of the officer in charge of a
police station to investigate into a cognizable
offence without the order of a Magistrate, to the
reduction of the first information regarding
commission of a cognizable offence, whether
received orally or in writing, into writing. As such,
the objective of such placement of provisions was
clear which was to ensure that the recording of the
first information should be the starting point of any
investigation by the police. The purpose of
registering FIR is to set the machinery of criminal
investigation into motion, which culminates with
filing of the police report and only after registration
of FIR, beginning of investigation in a case,
collection of evidence during investigation and
formation of the final opinion is the sequence which
results in filing of a report under Section 173 of the
Code. In George v. State of Kerala, it has been held
that the investigating officer is not obliged to
investigate, at the stage of inquest, or to ascertain
as to who were the assailants. A similar view has
been taken in Suresh Rai v. State of Bihar .
20. In this view of the matter, Sections 174 and
175 of the Code afford a complete Code in itself for
the purpose of “inquiries” in cases of accidental or
suspicious deaths and are entirely distinct from the
“investigation” under Section 157 of the Code
wherein if an officer in charge of a police station has
reason to suspect the commission of an offence
which he is empowered to investigate, he shall
proceed in person to the spot to investigate the
facts and circumstances of the case. In the case on
hand, an inquiry under Section 174 of the Code was
convened initially in order to ascertain whether the
death is natural or unnatural. The learned Senior
Counsel for the appellants claims that the earlier
information regarding unnatural death amounted to
FIR under Section 154 of the Code which was
investigated by the police and thereafter the case
was closed.
21. On a careful scrutiny of materials on record,
the inquiry which was conducted for the purpose of
ascertaining whether the death is natural or
unnatural cannot be categorised under information
relating to the commission of a cognizable offence
within the meaning and import of Section 154 of the
Code. On information received by Police Station
Mulana, the police made an inquiry as
contemplated under Section 174 of the Code. After
holding an inquiry, the police submitted its report
before the Sub-Divisional Magistrate, Ambala
stating therein that it was a case of hanging and no
cognizable offence is found to have been
committed. In the report, it was also mentioned that
the father of the deceased, R.P. Sharma (PW 1)
does not want to take any further action in the
matter. In view of the above discussion, it clearly
goes to show that what was undertaken by the
police was an inquiry under Section 174 of the
Code which was limited to the extent of natural or
unnatural death and the case was closed. Whereas,
the condition precedent for recording of FIR is that
there must be an information and that information
must disclose a cognizable offence and in the case
on hand, it leaves no matter of doubt that the
intimation was an information of the nature
contemplated under Section 174 of the Code and it
could not be categorised as information disclosing a
cognizable offence. Also, there is no material to
show that the police after conducting investigation
submitted a report under Section 173 of the Code
as contemplated, before the competent authority,
which accepted the said report and closed the case.
22. In view of the above, we are of the opinion that
the investigation on an inquiry under Section 174 of
the Code is distinct from the investigation as
contemplated under Section 154 of the Code
relating to commission of a cognizable offence and
in the case on hand there was no FIR registered
with Police Station Mulana neither any investigation
nor any report under Section 173 of the Code was
submitted. Therefore, challenge to the impugned
FIR under Crime No. 194 of 2005 registered by
Police Station Bhilai Nagar could not be assailed on
the ground that it was the second FIR in the garb of
which investigation or fresh investigation of the
same incident was initiated.”
13.   Section 2 (H) Cr.P.C. includes all the proceedings under
the Code for collection of evidence by a Police Officer or by
any person other than the Magistrate, who is authorised by the
Magistrate. Section 157 Cr.P.C. prescribed the procedure for
investigation. Section 174 deals with the inquest proceeding
upon receiving information by the police that a person has
committed suicide or has been killed in an accident or has died
under circumstances raising suspicion that some other person
has done some offence. The body of inquest proceeding is to
ascertain   the   apparent     cause  of   death.  The    inquest
proceedings are in the nature of inquiry in case of accident
which is entirely distincts from investigation under Section 157
Cr.P.C. Under Section 157 Cr.P.C., the Officer in Charge of a
Police Station having reason to suspect the commission of an
offence for which he is empowered to investigate, proceeds on
the spot. The investigation is done by the Police after receiving
information of a cognizable offence and investigation can be
done only under Section 157 Cr.P.C. which results in
submission of police report. However, during the inquest
proceeding, the Police Officer finds commission of cognizable
offence then he can lodge F.I.R. and can investigate further in
terms of Section 157 Cr.P.C.
14.   In the present case, the information for cognizable
offence was given by the informant on 28.10.2021 and
thereafter, the police started investigation because act of
commission of murder was disclosed in the F.I.R.
15.   Insofar as the charge is concerned, it is framed after
submission of charge sheet which contains the F.I.R. and
statement under Section 161 Cr.P.C., the cognizable offence is
made out and charges have been framed on the basis of the
material collected by the Investigating Officer. While framing
the charge, the court below has to consider prima facie case
even if the Court thinks that the accused might have
committed the offence it would frame the charge at the stage
of framing of charge and probative value of materials on
record, cannot be gone into. Paragraph Nos. 26 to 32 of the
judgment passed by Hon’ble the Supreme Court in the case of
State of Maharashtra and others Vs. Som Nath Thapa and
others reported in (1996) 4 SCC 659, are relevant which are
“26. Shri Ram Jethmalani has urged that despite
some variation in the language of the three pairs of
sections, which deal with the question of framing of
charge or discharge, being relatable to either a
sessions trial or trial of a warrant case or a
summons case, ultimately converge to a single
conclusion, namely, that a prima facie case must be
made out before a charge can be framed. This is
what was stated by a two-Judge Bench in R.S.
Nayak v. A.R. Antulay.
27. Let us note the three pairs of sections Shri
Jethmalani has in mind. These are Sections 227
and 228 insofar as sessions trial is concerned;
Sections 239 and 240 relatable to trial of warrant
cases; and Sections 245(1) and (2) qua trial of
summons cases. They read as below:
“227. Discharge.—If, upon consideration of
the record of the case and the documents
submitted therein, and after hearing the
submissions of the accused and the
prosecution in this behalf, the Judge
considers that there is not sufficient ground
for proceeding against the accused, he shall
discharge the accused and record his
reasons for so doing.
228. Framing of charge.—(1) If, after such
consideration and hearing as aforesaid, the
Judge is of opinion that there is ground for
presuming that the accused has committed
an offence which—
(a) is not exclusively triable by the Court of
Session, he may frame a charge against the
accused and, by order, transfer the case for
trial to the Chief Judicial Magistrate, and
thereupon the Chief Judicial Magistrate shall
try the offence in accordance with the
procedure for trial of warrant-cases instituted
on a police report;
(b) is exclusively triable by the court, he shall
frame in writing a charge against the
(2) Where the Judge frames any charge
under clause (b) of sub-section (1), the
charge shall be read and explained to the
accused and the accused shall be asked
whether he pleads guilty of the offence
charged or claims to be tried.
239. When accused shall be discharged.—If,
upon considering the police report and the
document sent with it under Section 173 and
making such examination, if any, of the
accused as the Magistrate thinks necessary
and after giving the prosecution and the
accused an opportunity of being heard, the
Magistrate considers the charge against the
accused to be groundless, he shall discharge
the accused, and record his reasons for so
240. Framing of charge.—(1) If, upon such
consideration, examination, if any, and
hearing the Magistrate is of opinion that there
is ground for presuming that the accused has
committed an offence triable under this
Chapter, which such Magistrate is competent
to try and which, in his opinion, could be
adequately punished by him, he shall frame
in writing a charge against the accused.
(2) The charge shall then be read and
explained to the accused, and he shall be
asked whether he pleads guilty of the offence
charged or claims to be tried.
245. When accused shall be discharged.—If,
upon taking all the evidence referred to in
Section 244, the Magistrate considers, for
reasons to be recorded, that no case against
the accused has been made out which, if
unrebutted, would warrant his conviction, the
Magistrate shall discharge him.
(2) Nothing in this section shall be deemed to
prevent a Magistrate from discharging the
accused at any previous stage of the case if,
for reasons to be recorded by such
Magistrate, he considers the charge to be
groundless.”
28. Before adverting to what was stated in Antulay
case let the view expressed in State of Karnataka v.
L. Muniswamy be noted. Therein, Chandrachud, J.
(as he then was) speaking for a three-Judge Bench
stated (at SCR p. 119 : SCC p. 704) that at the
stage of framing the charge the court has to apply
its mind to the question whether or not there is any
ground for presuming the commission of the offence
by the accused. As framing of charge affects a
person's liberty substantially, need for proper
consideration of material warranting such order was
29. What was stated in this regard in Stree Atyachar
Virodhi Parishad case which was quoted with
approval in paragraph 78 of State of W.B. v. Mohd.
Khalid is that what the court has to see, while
considering the question of framing the charge, is
whether the material brought on record would
reasonably connect the accused with the crime. No
more is required to be inquired into.
30. In Antulay case Bhagwati, C.J., opined, after
noting the difference in the language of the three
pairs of sections, that despite the difference there is
no scope for doubt that at the stage at which the
court is required to consider the question of framing
of charge, the test of “prima facie” case has to be
applied. According to Shri Jethmalani, a prima facie
case can be said to have been made out when the
evidence, unless rebutted, would make the accused
liable to conviction. In our view, a better and clearer
statement of law would be that if there is ground for
presuming that the accused has committed the
offence, a court can justifiably say that a prima facie
case against him exists, and so, frame a charge
against him for committing that offence.
31. Let us note the meaning of the word ‘presume’.
In Black's Law Dictionary it has been defined to
mean “to believe or accept upon probable
evidence”. (emphasis ours). In Shorter Oxford
English Dictionary it has been mentioned that in law
‘presume’ means “to take as proved until evidence
to the contrary is forthcoming”, Stroud's Legal
Dictionary has quoted in this context a certain
judgment according to which “A presumption is a
probable consequence drawn from facts (either
certain, or proved by direct testimony) as to the
truth of a fact alleged.” (emphasis supplied). In Law
Lexicon by P. Ramanath Aiyer the same quotation
finds place at p. 1007 of 1987 Edn.
32. The aforesaid shows that if on the basis of
materials on record, a court could come to the
conclusion that commission of the offence is a
probable consequence, a case for framing of
charge exists. To put it differently, if the court were
to think that the accused might have committed the
offence it can frame the charge, though for
conviction the conclusion is required to be that the
accused has committed the offence. It is apparent
that at the stage of framing of a charge, probative
value of the materials on record cannot be gone
into; the materials brought on record by the
prosecution has to be accepted as true at that
stage.”
16.    The same view has been taken by Hon’ble the Supreme
Court in the case of Bhawna Bai Vs. Ghanshyam and others
reported in (2020) 2 SCC 217. Paragraph nos.16 and 17 of the
said judgment are relevant and are quoted below:-
“16. After referring to Amit Kapoor in Dinesh Tiwari
v. State of U.P., the Supreme Court held that for
framing charge under Section 228 CrPC, the Judge
is not required to record detailed reasons as to why
such charge is framed. On perusal of record and
hearing of parties, if the Judge is of the opinion that
there is sufficient ground for presuming that the
accused has committed the offence triable by the
Court of Session, he shall frame the charge against
the accused for such offence.
17. As discussed above, in the present case, upon
hearing the parties and considering the allegations
in the charge-sheet, the learned Second Additional
Sessions Judge was of the opinion that there were
sufficient grounds for presuming that the accused
has committed the offence punishable under
Section 302 IPC read with Section 34 IPC. The
order dated 12-12-2018 framing the charges is not
a detailed order. For framing the charges under
Section 228 CrPC, the Judge is not required to
record detailed reasons. As pointed out earlier, at
the stage of framing the charge, the court is not
required to hold an elaborate enquiry; only prima
facie case is to be seen. As held in Kanti Bhadra
Shah v. State of W.B., while exercising power under
Section 228 CrPC, the Judge is not required to
record his reasons for framing the charges against
the accused. Upon hearing the parties and based
upon the allegations and taking note of the
allegations in the charge-sheet, the learned Second
Additional Sessions Judge was satisfied that there
is sufficient ground for proceeding against the
accused and framed the charges against the
accused-Respondents 1 and 2. While so, the High
Court was not right in interfering with the order of
the trial court framing the charges against the
accused-Respondents 1 and 2 under Section 302
IPC read with Section 34 IPC and the High Court, in
our view, erred in quashing the charges framed
against the accused. The impugned order cannot
therefore be sustained and is liable to be set aside”
17.    Sri Yogendra Singh, learned counsel for the revisionist
has relied upon the judgment of Manohari Vs. The District
Superintendent of Police (supra), the said judgment is not
applicable in the present case. In the said case, the
information under Section 174 Cr.P.C. was given and the Court
has observed that on conclusion of the investigation, the police
shall file a final report under Section 173(2) Cr.P.C. only before
the Jurisdictional Magistrate and not before the Executive
Magistrate. This will apply in both cases, where the final report
is positive report or is a closure report.
18.    In the present case, there is only one F.I.R. registered on
28.10.2021, as Case Crime No.74 of 2021, under Section 302
The earlier information by Portal/Pointsman, Mukesh Kumar to
the Police dated 26.10.2021, was an information regarding
unknown dead body lying near railway line which can be
termed as F.I.R. Preparation of inquest under Section 174
Cr.P.C. regarding death of the deceased, postmortem
examination and detailed accident report was in fact in the
nature of inquiry and it cannot be equated with the
investigation contemplates under Section 157 Cr.P.C. which
commenced after lodging of F.I.R. under Section 154 Cr.P.C.
19.    In view of the aforesaid discussion, it is obvious that the
F.I.R. lodged on 28.10.2021 for offence which is cognizable,
therefore, investigation was conducted under Section 157
Cr.P.C. The first report dated 26.10.2021 was an information
tendered by Portal/Pointsman, Mukesh Kumar, the railway
authority regarding an unknown dead body which was lying
near railway line and the same cannot be termed as F.I.R. The
preparation of inquest report under Section 174 Cr.P.C.
regarding death of deceased, postmortem examination and
detailed accident report, was in fact, in the nature of inquiry
and it cannot be equated with investigation contemplated
20.    The charges have been framed after collecting material
on record and court below had no option but to frame the
21.   In view of the aforesaid discussion, the revision lacks
merit and it is dismissed.
Location: High Court of Judicature at
