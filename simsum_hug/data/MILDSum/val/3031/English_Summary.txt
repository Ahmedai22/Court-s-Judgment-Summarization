The Punjab and Haryana High Court has granted bail to Kalyani Singh, who is the daughter of Himachal Pradesh High Court judge, Justice Sabina, in connection with the 2015 Sippy Sidhu murder case. 
The bail has been granted by the bench of Justice Sureshwar Thakur.
Sukhmanpreet Singh Sidhu, alias Sippy Sidhu, was a national-level shooter and lawyer who was shot dead by unknown assailants at around 09:00-10:00 PM in September 2015 in Sector 27 park at Chandigarh. The probe in the matter was transferred to CBI in compliance with an order of Home Secretary UT Administration Chandigarh in the year 2016. 
It may be noted that Kalyani was arrested by CBI in June 2022, after the central agency filed an application seeking her police custody remand before Special Judge stating that on completion of the investigation, it had filed a final report u/s 173 Cr. P.C in 2020 and now, they want to take up further investigation w.r.t the role of suspect Kalyani Singh & others in Sidhu's murder.
After her arrest, Kalyani had approached the high court for bail on July 27, soon after her bail plea was dismissed by a trial court. 
It is the case of CBI that Kalyani and Sippy were in a close relationship and she wanted to marry him, however, when her proposal was rejected by Sidhu's family, he allegedly leaked some of her objectionable photographs to her parents and friends, which caused embarrassment to her family.
Being annoyed with her pictures being leaked and her proposal being denied, she played a role in his murder. CBI has alleged that Kalyani was the woman who was accompanying Sippy's killer.
It is the case of CBI that Kalyani compelled Sippy to meet her in the park, where she was present with an unknown assailant and thereafter, she killed him by using firearms and fled the spot.
