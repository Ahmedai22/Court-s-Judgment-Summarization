Section 25/27/54 of Arms Act, registered at Police Station Special Crime
Branch, Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), Chandigarh. It is relevant to
mention that the investigations into the instant crime event, were initially
entered into by the Chandigarh Police but subsequently, through an order
No. 134-HIII(2)-2016/1339 dated 20.1.2016 of the Home Secretary,
Chandigarh Administration, the investigations were transferred to the CBI,
resultantly, the crime event became registered with the Special Crime
2.           The crime event, occurred near Kothi No. 1001, Sector 27-B,
Chandigarh. An intimation was given by the Sub Inspector concerned to the
Station House Officer (SHO), Police Station, Sector 26, Chandigarh that
when the police party was present in the area of Police Station, to spot
attend, in the Government vehicle bearing registration No. CH01G1-6243,
then they at about 10 PM, received an intimation through wireless message
in the Police Station, that a person is lying near Kothi No. 1001, Sector 27-

pool of blood on a pedestrian track in the green park adjoining Kothi No.
1015, Sector 27-B, Chandigarh. He was noticed to be carrying injuries on
his left cheek and chest and blood was oozing from the above injuries. The
police suspected that he had received gun shot injuries. Since the spot
inspection revealed that an offence under Section 302 of the Indian Penal
Code has been committed, therefore, a ruqa was sent from the crime site to
the Police Station concerned for registration of a case under Section 302 of
the Indian Penal Code against unknown persons.

5.            After referring to all the material collected during the course of
investigations, the Investigating Officer concerned proceeded to conclude
that, an untraced report is to be filed in respect of the petition FIR, and,
ultimately he did so, through his instituting the same on 7.12.2020, before
the learned committal Court concerned. However, after the institution of
the above referred untraced report on 7.12.2020, before the learned
committal Court, the latter on 8.12.2020, made an order to declare whether
the report as became filed before it by the Investigating Officer was a final
report or an untraced report or a status report, obviously for this purpose,
the learned Court adjourned the matter to 14.12.2020.
6.            On 14.12.2020, as is apparent from a reading of the order as
then made, the Investigating Officer concerned made a statement that no
investigation is pending in respect of the petition FIR, except the report of
the polygraph test being awaited. He further then states, that they are not
seeking further investigations of the case. However, the learned committal
Court concerned adjourned the committal proceedings to 12.1.2021 for the
filing of a fresh report by the CBI. However, even on 12.1.2021, the CBI
did not file any final report, but submitted that the polygraph test of some of
the suspects, is to be made by the CFSL, New Delhi, respectively on
3.3.2021 and on 4.3.2021. Therefore, for the afore purpose, the committal
proceedings were adjourned to 15.3.2021. But even on 15.3.2021, no final
report became filed before the learned committal Court, but a direction was
then made, that the CBI ensuring that the relevant tests are conducted by the
CFSL, New Delhi. The matter was adjourned to 31.3.2021. On 31.3.2021,
the CBI moved an application for conducting the polygraph test of Shri
Simarandeep Singh Sandhu and of Shri Karampal Singh as the same had
been scheduled on 19.4.2021 and on 20.4.2021 at CFSL, New Delhi.
Therefore, the committal proceedings were adjourned to 3.5.2021 for a
report about the above tests being submitted before the Court.              On
22.4.2021. the learned committal Court concerned upon, being seized with
the report drawn by the PGIMER, with an opinion therein that “looking at
the enclosed prescriptions of Mr. Sandhu (applicant/suspect) from Omni
Clinics, it seems that he is on medications, which according to available
literature, have been found to have potential of interfering with the accurate
interpretation of the polygraph test, e.g. Betacap (propranolol and
Tryptomer amitriptyline).” Therefore, the learned committal Court ordered
that the reply of CBI, be furnished with respect to the veracity of the above
report making speakings about the inability of conducting of polygraph test,
upon, suspect Simrandeep Singh Sandhu. However, on 3.5.2021, the above
Simrandeep Singh Sandhu was ordered to be provided with the report
(supra). Moreover, on 1.6.2021, the learned committal Court, in view of the
medical report (supra), issued notice to the CBI, upon, the above suspect's
application, for hence his being permitted to withdraw his earlier consent
for his undertaking the polygraph test. On 7.7.2021, the learned committal
Court proceeded to allow Simrandeep Singh Sandhu to withdraw his earlier
consent as made on 12.11.2020 to undergo his polygraphy test, but yet
permitted the investigating team to employ upon them Forensic
Psychological Assessment besides Layered Voice Analysis (LVA). Even
suspect Karampal Singh moved an application for withdrawal of the earlier
consent given by him to undergo polygraph test, as such, notice of the above
application was given to the CBI, besides, notice was given to the CBI, on
Simrandeep Singh Sandhu's application, that he may not be called to CFSL,
New Delhi.      On the above applications, the learned committal Court
permitted the applicants (supra) to withdraw their earlier consent for theirs
undergoing the above polygraph tests besides also denied to the CBI their
request to perform Layered Voice Analysis, upon, the above suspects.
Moreover, it also ordered that nothing more is to be done on the part of the
investigating agency rather ordered that the proceedings be listed on
16.8.2021, for the purpose of considering the acceptance/rejection of the
untraced report submitted by the CBI.
7.           On 16.8.2021, notice was given to the family members of the
deceased to make a protest to the acceptance of the untraced report as
became instituted on 8.12.2020 by the CBI.           In pursuance thereto, on
22.9.2021, the relatives of the deceased asked for an opportunity to file a
protest against the acceptance of the untraced report. Subsequently, various
dates became assigned to the concerned to complete the respective
pleadings. On 12.1.2022, aggrieved victims filed a protest petition before
the learned committal Court against the acceptance of the untraced report.
Moreover, an opportunity was granted to the concerned to institute a reply
thereto.   On 7.2.2022 besides continuously thereafter, a perusal of the
committal proceedings, discloses that the Investigating Officer concerned
not asserting any pointed inculpatory evidence becoming collected against
the present petitioner. On 23.2.2022, a reference was made to an order
dated 14.2.2022, whereby two months' time was asked by the Investigating
Officer to conclude the investigation, and, hence, the learned committal
Court adjourned the committal proceedings to 16.3.2022 for submitting the
8.           However, on 16.3.2022, the Investigating Officer submitted
before the learned committal Court, that as per source information the last
four digits of Maruti Zen Car spotted at the place of incident besides at the
relevant time are “1183” and, that the record from the Department of
Transport concerned, in respect of the above is to be collected. However, a
perusal of the subsequent proceedings thereto drawn by the learned
committal Court does not reveal that the identity of the owner of the car
became revealed to the Court.          Thereafter, on 27.7.2022, the learned
committal Court directed the Investigating Officer concerned to submit in
Court the statements of the witnesses recorded under Section 161 of the
Code of Criminal Procedure besides the documents mentioned in the final
report dated 7.12.2020, but yet in a sealed cover.            Moreover, it also
permitted the Investigating Agency to record supplementary statements of
any witness already examined. In addition, a perusal of the orders as made
subsequent to the order (supra), does not disclose that the learned committal
Court had proceeded to accept the untraced report as became submitted
before it on 7.12.2020 by the CBI. Therefore, then the investigations were
yet underway into the crime event.
9 (I).       The crime site occurs in the neighbourhood of the house of
Rajanbir Singh, Amreeta Singh besides occurs in the vicinity of the house(s)
of Vikram Nagpal and Vishal Nagpal. The statements of all the above
including the statement of Kundan Lal, a domestic help of Rajanbir Singh
became initially recorded by the Investigating Officer concerned, but after a
period of almost six months elapsing since the happening of the crime event
at the crime site.
II.          The learned counsel appearing for the petitioner submits, that
these statements are only to the effect, that qua Rajanbir Singh and Kundan
Lal, on hearing gunshot sounds, hence, leading Rajanbir Singh to move to
the boundary wall of his house, overlooking the park where the crime
occurrence took place.      Moreover, he has stated that when he moved
towards the wall, he heard two more shots being fired in quick succession,
and upon, his reaching near the wall, his seeing a person of medium height
walking away from the wall side. In the above process of the said person
walking, he stopped midway at the walking track, and, turned his face to
look at this witness, but Rajanbir states that he knelt down to avoid his
being sighted. Even the domestic help of Rajanbir Singh, namely, Kundal
Lal makes an alike statement but the learned counsel for the petitioner
submits, that their statements are not worthy of any credence, as they have
not mentioned thereins, the trite factum about the physical features of the
running persons nor mentioned about each sighting any weapon of offence
being carried by the said person nor have mentioned the presence of any
lady at the relevant time at the crime site. Even otherwise, he submits that
since the statements of the above witnesses were recorded after nearly eight
months elapsing since the taking place of the crime occurrence. Therefore,
their statements cannot be relied theirs being hit by Section 162 of the Code
of Criminal Procedure. Besides, he submits that despite Rajanbir Singh
being re-examined by the CBI on 20.5.20216, his statement has been
withheld which does, prima facie, speak about the malafides of the
III.          Another statement of Amreeta Singh wife of Rajanbir singh,
resident of Kothi No. 1015, Sector 27-B, Chandigarh became recorded on
20.5.2016, but evidently also with a period of more than eight months
elapsing since the crime happening at the crime site. In the above made
statement, she submits that she heard the screams of a woman and later saw
a girl walking towards her car and driving away. Therefore, he submits that
since in semi darkness, Amreeta Singh saw a fleeting glimpse of a girl,
resultantly, when she did not in her initial statement made on 20.9.2015,
rather reveal the physical features of the lady or of the girl concerned. As
such, he submits that the supplementary statement as recorded on 4.8.2020,
of one Amreeta Singh, wherein she, as submitted by learned counsel for the
CBI, recollected from memory the physical features of a girl she then saw
besides, aided the drawing of sketches by the Investigating Officer
concerned, whereafter, she related the drawn sketches of a girl to the
identity of the present petitioner, also cannot be believed. In resting the
above submission, he grooves it on the factum, that only if she had at the
initial stage in her earlier previous statement recorded by the Investigating
Officer concerned rather revealed the physical features of the present
petitioner, thus, leading to the conducting of a valid test identification
parade, whereins Amreeta Singh identified the present petitioner, thereupon,
alone may be credence could be assigned to hers validly then identifying the
petitioner, rather than through the above mode.
IV.           Moreover, he submits that no reliance also can be placed on the
statement of Jatinder Singh who respectively made certain statements on
1.8.2016, on 21.11.2017, on 9.1.2018, on 1.2.2019 and on 1.9.2020, given
all the above statements being recorded with more than ten months elapsing
since the happening of the crime event at the crime site, thus, attracting
thereons the bar under Section 162 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. He
further submits that no reliance can ever be placed, upon the above
statements, as he is not an ocular witness to the crime event, but only claims
that he reached the Press Club area of Sector 27, in the vicinity of the spot,
at about 7 PM on 20.9.2015, and, but obviously not at the relevant time.
Moreover, he submits that since the statement of supra, is also mentioned in
the untraced report, therefore, when even then the CBI did not draw any
inculpation against the petitioner. Therefore, no reliance thereons even at
this stage can be placed by the CBI.
V.           The learned counsel for the petitioner also submits that since
the Investigating Officer concerned, has failed to produce from the service
provider concerned, the call data even appertaining to the cell phone of
Jatinder Singh, revealing from the apposite tower locations concerned, qua
his being present at the crime site or at any other place. Therefore, he
submits that the effect of non collections (supra), is that, they do minimise
the evidentiary effect, if any, of the statement of one Jatinder Singh.
VI.          In paragraphs 16.13 to 16.16, the prosecution assigns the
incriminatory fact to the petitioner qua hers nursing a motive to commit the
crime on the ground of her proposal to marry the deceased being spurned by
the relatives of the deceased, on the ground of it, being an inter-caste
VII.         The learned counsel for the petitioner has argued, that the
emphasis as now made by the CBI qua the present petitioner nursing a
motive to commit the offence, thus, emerging from the deceased
transmitting her obscene photographs, to various persons including her
family members, resulting in embarrassment being caused to her, is in
complete contradiction, to what emerges in paragraphs 16.13 to 16.16 of the
untraced report.       Therefore, he submits that the relevant subsequent
changings of stand by the CBI qua the foundational fact relating to
attribution of a motive to the petitioner does become suspect. He further
submits, that the above change, is the result of the CBI making alignments
with an alike attribution of motive to the present petitioner by the
complainant. Therefore, he submits that the investigations into the crime
event are completely coloured and are not fair objective and impartisan
VIII.        He also submits that the projection made by the complainant
that the deceased had taken to abandon his ties with the petitioner, upon, his
acquiring knowledge of hers having other relationships, is also completely
IX.          Learned counsel for the petitioner contends that even the
attribution of the above motive to the present petitioner becomes completely
a)      Annexure P8 at page 116, whose readings reveals the
earnestness of the deceased to remain close to the
petitioner besides sheds light qua the deceased having
multiple affairs.
b)      In para 16.37/page 53, there is a reference to an email
dated 29.8.2015.        The same is placed on record as
Annexure P-8/122. This is followed by another email at
page 123 of the same date.       In the same chain, it is
significant to refer to an email dated August 30, 2015 at
page 124. All these emails totally falsify the theory of
any breach of ties amongst the petitioner and the
deceased. Moreover, the above emails reflect that the
deceased had promptly conveyed to the petitioner the
perceived threat to his life from some unknown quarters.
These emails assume great importance as they relate to a
period when the deceased was abroad.
c)      Strangely enough, the prosecution itself has alleged at
page 57/para 16.46, that the petitioner had visited the
office of Sippy Sidhu on 18.9.2015 as also on 19.9.2015.
Therefore, the untraced report of the CBI revealing about
breach of ties amongst the deceased and the petitioner is
false. Moreover, tears apart the contention        of the
respondent that there was any animosity amongst the
deceased and the petitioner.      The above assertion is
contended to falsify the so called theory of the CBI that
the petitioner had clandestinely made calls to the
deceased, on 18.9.2020, in order to conceal her identity.
X.           The learned counsel for the petitioner further submits, that upto
the stage of the filing of the untraced report, before the learned committal
Court, there was no incriminatory evidence available against her but she
was named only in the column of suspects. Therefore, he contends that the
sudden emergences subsequent thereto of any incriminatory material against
her, is a result of complete twisting and skewings of investigations. Even
otherwise, he submits that since the above emails exchanges are suggestive
of no break down occurring in the ties amongst the petitioner and the
deceased. Therefore, there was no occasion for her to make calls to him
from unknown numbers.          Moreover, he further submits, that even the
petitioner visiting or interacting with the deceased on two days prior to the
occurrence also does not arouse any suspicion as both were, throughout on
amicable terms. He submits, that the trite evidence with respect to call
details of the petitioner along with apposite tower locations particularly
relating to the trite factum that in and around the relevant time, she was at
the crime site, rather is completely absent. Therefore, no argument can be
raised that on the asking of the petitioner, the deceased had arrived at the
crime site.
XI.          The learned counsel further submits, that it emerges from
paragraph 16.40 of the untraced report, that the relevant calls were from
some quarters which caused some fright in the mind of the deceased,
especially when the answer of the deceased to the first call was “Main
Karda Haan Main Karda Haan”, besides his response to the call at 8.12
PM being “Meri Taan Fatt Gai Si.” Therefore, they are reflective of the
caller concerned being a Mafia Don and his taking to threaten the deceased.
Resultantly, the learned counsel argues that the above aspect has remained
un-investigated into by the CBI, whereas, upon complete objective
investigations being made thereinto rather then the fact of participation in
the crime event of some other relevant offender would have emerged.
XII.         The learned counsel submits that since the readings of the
emails exchanged amongst the petitioner and the deceased, thus, occurring
in Annexure P-8, especially at page 120 of the paper book, reflect that, since
some maruti car with persons carrying weapons rather occupying the same,
thus, arousing suspicion in the mind of the deceased, about theirs' rearing an
ill motive against the deceased, resulting in advise being purveyed to the
deceased by the petitioner, that an intimation about the above fact be made
to the DGP. However, the Investigating Officer concerned has not made
any investigations in respect of the above, resultantly completely skewed
investigations, are conducted, thus, excluding the role of the above in the
crime event.
XIII.        The petitioner has been able to successfully establish the plea
of alibi inasmuch as at the relevant time hers being present in a party. He
submits that the above is corroborated by a positive polygraph test as made
upon the father of the petitioner, no matter the result of the polygraph test as
made upon the present petitioner being declared deceptive.
XIV.         The learned counsel for the petitioner lastly submits, that since
there is a reference in the untraced report, about the deceased having
multiple affairs besides with his admitting in various emails exchanged with
the petitioner qua his taken to be holdings ties with multiple lady friends, as
such, some other girl friends may have nursed a pointed motive to murder
the deceased. He pointedly submits that even upto the evening of the
relevant day, the deceased was in the company of GF-I.
10.          The learned counsel for the CBI has submitted that the
evidence collected in the year 2021 by the CBI is truthful and worthy of
credence as it contains an eye witness account with respect to the crime
event. The said eye witness account is comprised in the statement of one
Jatinder Singh. Moreover, it is also submitted that since one Jiwan Singh,
the domestic help of deceased has on 21.10.2021, got recorded his statement
that on the relevant date, the deceased apprised him that he has to meet the
petitioner. Therefore, it is contended that the petitioner was available at the
crime site.
11.          The learned counsel for the complainant has argued, that the
investigations which were earlier conducted into the crime event, by the
Chandigarh Police were, highly influenced investigations, as is apparent
from the officer of the CBI, at the end of the untraced report, making a
suggestion that for destruction of evidence, the relevant proceedings be
drawn against the errant police officials concerned. He submits that the
evidence destroyed did inculpate the present petitioner. Further more, he
submits that if certain portions of the DVR or of the CCTV footage existing
within or outside the neighbourhood of the crime site, was collected and
analyzed, then the inculpation of the present petitioner would have been but
squarely revealed. He submits that with a view to suppress the participation
of the present petitioner in the crime event, the complete detail (s) of the
DVR and of the CCTV footage has been deleted at the instance of the
officers of the Chandigarh Police. Moreover, he submits that the ocular
account rendered in respect of the crime event by one Jatinder Singh, also
becomes corroborated as is evident from the identification made of the
petitioner by one Amreeta Singh, in the year 2020.
12.          The motive assigned to the present petitioner, in the untraced
report which has been instituted on 7.12.2020 before the learned committal
Court, is that, owing to breach of promise of marriage by the deceased
arising from his relatives opposing the same, it being an inter-caste
marriage, hence, the petitioner developing an animosity towards the
deceased. If so, the above motive in the mind of the petitioner, may have
normally earlier led the CBI to then assign inculpability to the petitioner,
but the CBI did not then do so. However, it chose to yet file an untraced
report but kept the petitioner in the column of suspects. Therefore, if at the
time of institution of an untraced report by the CBI, apparently it did not
attach any importance to the above purported motive carried in the mind of
the petitioner. Thus, obviously then the CBI also did not collect further
incriminatory evidence against the petitioner, for its then seeking to
pointedly then inculpate the petitioner. However, rather then the CBI as
stated (supra) kept the petitioner in the column of suspects.
13.          Therefore, at the above stage except the above motive, there
was no further incriminatory evidence available with the CBI to, prima
facie, firmly connect the petitioner with the crime event. The untraced report
as stated above, never became accepted by the learned committal Court. In
consequence, in the CBI now assigning any motive to the present petitioner,
is but, prima facie, an after thought besides, is prima facie a stratagem
employed by it to somehow yet on its score assign guilt to the present
petitioner. This Court, prima facie, finds that the above is but a consequence
of protest against the acceptance of the untraced report being preferred by
the aggrieved, who thereins assigned a motive to the petitioner qua the
deceased taking to share the cell phone clicked obscene pictures of the
petitioner with certain individuals and the family members of the petitioner,
resulting in embarrassment being caused to her, whereafter she allegedly
nursed an ill motive to commit the offence. The CBI has adopted a similar
stand and thus has obviously changed the above initially assigned motive
by it to the petitioner, which, however, then was also not deemed fit to
inculpate the petitioner. Therefore, it appears that the investigations made
into the aspect of an ill motive, if any, nursed by the petitioner against the
deceased are but, prima facie, a result of coloured investigations by the CBI
into the crime event and that too, for reasons best known to it, it rather
making alignments with the motive assigned to the petitioner by the
aggrieved. Therefore, the investigations into the aspect of ill motive, if any,
nursed by the petitioner against the deceased, can but be concluded to be,
prima facie, made not in an objective mode, but in a partisan and coloured
mode. The said investigations into the aspect of motive, thus prima facie do
not inspire the confidence of this Court.
14.          The effect of the different motives at different stages being
assigned by the CBI to the petitioner, is that, thus the same also prima facie
becomes inconsequential.
15.          The reasons for forming the above conclusion arise from the
factum that in the close proximity of the happening of the crime, it being,
but evident from all the available whatsapp messages exchanged amongst
the petitioner and the deceased, that both the petitioner and the deceased
were enjoying the most cordial relations. It is also, prima facie, evident
from a reading of Annexure P-8 at page 116 of the paper book besides from
a reading of paragraph 16.37 at page 53 of the untraced report, besides on a
perusal of Annexure P-8, pages 122-123 of the paper book, that both the
petitioner and the deceased (supra) were till the end having the most cordial
relations. The above contended break down of ties at the relevant time
amongst the concerned, is also, prima facie belied from a reading of page 57
of the paper book, whereins, it is revealed that the petitioner had visited the
office of the deceased both on 18.9.2015 and on 19.9.2015, hence, prior to
the occurrence.     There is also no evidence, at this stage, on record to
suggest, that when the petitioner visited the office of the deceased, on
18.9.2015 as also on 19.9.2015, that then there occurred bickerings amongst
them. Therefore, when the above dates are close to the happening of the
crime incident, it can but be, prima facie, concluded that upto the happening
of the crime event there was no acrimony amongst them. Inconsequence, the
assignings of motive by the prosecution to the petitioner, prima facie, does
become completely enveloped in a cloud of doubt nor prima facie at this
stage, any inculpatory effect can be attached theretos.
16.          The prosecution attributed to the petitioner yet the role of hers
carrying animosity towards the deceased and in doing so, it relies upon one
Hari Shankar Gupta who stated, that on that day, i.e., 18.9.2015, at 8.15 PM,
a girl of age about 25 years, wearing top and jeans and a dupatta of dark
colour wrapped around her neck, open hair upto the shoulder, with physical
features like the petitioner, had visited his premises and had asked him to
give his mobile as she stated that his phone has been left at home. On her
request, he handed over his mobile to her and after completing the call, he
submits that she returned his mobile to him but only after hers deleting the
dialled number. The above call is stated to be attended by the deceased
when he was present along with his Girl Friend-I (GF-I) at Industrial Area,
Chandigarh. However, the above call is made on 18.9.2015 and is not made
on at the relevant date inasmuch as on 20.9.2015. Therefore, it may not be
given much importance. Moreover, when on the basis of the above call, a
reference is made even in the untraced report instituted by the CBI.
Therefore, if any importance was to be assigned to the above phone call,
then the CBI may have then taken to then on its basis, hence inculpate the
petitioner, than to then file an untraced report, but it did not then do so.
Insofar as Hari Shankar Gupta from whose cell phone, some unknown calls
were made purportedly by the petitioner to the deceased, and as stated by
Hari Shankar Gupta, the caller relating to the identity of the petitioner, this
Court would deal with the same at a subsequent stage. Reiteratedly, from
the above drawn inferences, it can but be prima facie concluded that the
motive as initially assigned to the petitioner by the CBI, has not been ably
established.   The above motive was earlier abandoned by the CBI, but
subsequently the CBI changed its stand to bring alignments with the motive
(supra) assigned to the petitioner, by the complainant which yet however
also for reasons (supra), does not appeal to the judicial conscience of this
Court qua, prima facie, it carrying any inculpatory effect.
17.          In the neighbourhood of the crime site, there exists the house of
Rajanbir Singh, Amreeta Singh besides the house of one Vikram Nagpal
and Vishal Nagpal. Rajanbir Singh and Amreeta Singh have a domestic
help one Kundan Lal.         Both Rajanbir Singh and Kundan Lal joined
investigations but after six months elapsing since the happening of the
crime event at the crime site. In their respectively made statements, they do
not reveal the identity of the petitioner nor do they reveal her physical
features. The only statement which they make, is about, theirs hearing
gunshot sounds, as emanated from the crime site. Importantly, they only
refer to a male person being sighted at the crime site. On the other hand,
Amreeta Singh wife of Rajanbir Singh who joined investigations with
almost eight months elapsing since the crime happening at the crime site,
though did then, proceed to make a statement revealing, that she had heard
the screams of a woman and that later she had seen a girl walking towards
her car and driving away. Importantly, however, except the above, she has
also not thereins disclosed the physical features of the girl concerned.
However, in her supplementary statement recorded by the CBI on 4.8.2020,
the above Amreeta Singh, appears to recollect from her memory the
physical features of the girl, she saw at the crime site besides appears to aid
the Investigating Officer concerned, to draw sketches of the girl concerned
whom she relates to the identity of the petitioner. However, the above
cannot become a valid ground for concluding that the same is a valid
substitute, to the required test identification parade being conducted, by the
Investigating Officer,       whereins, Amreeta Singh, hence identifying/
identified the petitioner. Importantly during the course of investigations, no
valid test identification parade was ever held. It appears that it was not ever
held because in her initially made statement, as made with more than eight
months elapsing since the happening of the crime event, she did not thereins
mention the key characteristic identifiable physical features of the
petitioner. Though, Amreeta Singh's statement is made with more than
eight months elapsing since the crime event taking place and is prima facie
hence hit by Section 162 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. But even if it
has some credence, yet in the initial statement she was to yet detail the
marked identifiable physical features of the girl. However, she did not then
do so. If in a supplementary statement as made by her on 4.8.2020, she
from making recollections from her memory, qua the physical configuration
of the girl rather, aided the CBI to draw some sketches besides also related
the drawn sketches to the petitioner, but yet prima facie also no credence
can be assigned thereto. The reason is, but obvious, that credence could be
assigned to the above only when in her initially made statement, she had
recorded the marked identifiable physical attributes of the girl whom she
saw at the crime site. She did not then do so. Thus in hers subsequently
doing so, she is prima facie concluded to be so doing under tutorings being
given to her by the CBI. Therefore, she is prima facie concluded to be a
planted witness or an engineered witness. Moreover, since she has only
inculpated the petitioner through preparation of sketches of the girl, she saw
at the crime site. Resultantly, no credence can be assigned to the above
manner of hers identifying the petitioner.        Reiteratedly, when as above
stated it is never a valid substitute to the required valid test identification
parade being conducted. The above valid test identification parade never
became conducted by the Investigating Officer concerned.
18.           The pivot of the prosecution case, is rested on the statement of
one Jatinder Singh, who is claimed to be an ocular witness. He, had on four
occasions earlier to 9.11.2021 made statements to the Investigating Officer
concerned, inasmuch as, on 1.8.2016, on 21.11.2017, on 9.1.2018, 0n
1.2.2019 and on 1.9.2020. However, in none of the statements, he claimed
himself to be an eye witness of the occurrence. Surprisingly and suddenly,
in a statement made on 9.11.2021 under Section 161 of the Code of
Criminal Procedure, he claimed himself to be an eye witness, to the
occurrence, and named the present petitioner to be the prime inculpatory
participant in the crime event. The above made statement is prima facie
weak and cannot be accepted.
19.          The reason being that when an untraced report was filed, his
statements as made prior thereto, were already with the CBI, where he never
claimed himself to be an eye witness of the occurrence. However, he makes
a somersault, during the phase of the learned committal Court being seized
with an untraced report and with the protest against its acceptance being
made by the aggrieved, through his making a statement on 9.11.2021
whereins he claims himself to be an eye witness of the occurrence.
Necessarily, prima facie, the above statement of Jatinder Singh which is but
completely contradistinct to his earlier statements, thus does become
enveloped in a deep shroud of suspicion. Consequently, the above is but a
planted witness as also a witness who has been coached by the Investigating
Agency only for solving the murder of the deceased.
20.          In addition, the cell phone of Jatinder Singh was the best
electronic evidence for prima facie supporting his statement as made on
9.11.2021.    The call data thereof, besides the apposite tower locations
revealing his presence in and around the crime site at the relevant time, may
have prima facie led this Court to assign credibility to this statement.
However, all the above never became collected by the Investigating Officer.
Absence of collections (supra) does also prima facie devalue his statements
(supra). It was but incumbent upon the Investigating Officer concerned to
not only collect his mobile phone besides also to ensure the collection of all
relevant data from the service provider concerned, revealing that he along
with his mobile phone was available at the crime site. It was then only that
this Court may have been assured that he was, at the relevant time, in and
around the vicinity of the crime site. Surprisingly, the above has not been
done, and, prima facie hence it adversely impacts the statement of Jatinder
Singh.    Therefore, at this stage, the said statement does not carry any
evidentiary strength.
21.           It appears that in the neighbourhood of the crime site, some
DVRs were existing and they enclosed CCTV footages of the crime event.
The above, though then became collected by the then Investigating Agency
concerned, but in para 16.44 of the untraced report, there is no disclosure
that at the relevant time, the present petitioner was revealed thereins to be
present at the crime site. The above comprised the best evidence to make
this Court, prima facie conclude that the present petitioner, at the relevant
time, was at the crime site. Despite the CBI in the untraced report making a
declaration, that only a part of the incident became enclosed in the DVR as
became collected from the neighbourhood of the crime site, but it alleges
that the then Investigating Agency taking to destroy the other portions of the
CCTV footage, besides also the DVR. However, prima facie, the above fact
could have been supported, only by the report of the CFSL, New Delhi, but
the above finding is not available on the record. Therefore, the enclosings
in the DVR, may be of only a fraction of the crime event and not of the
entire crime scene, may be rather attributable to some glitches in the DVR,
than prima facie to any tamperings or destructions being made at the
instance     of the then Investigating Agency concerned.           The above
attributions of tamperings/destructions, to the earlier Investigating Agency,
as, made in the untraced report filed by the CBI, appear to be prima facie
totally mis-founded besides, appear to be made to camouflage the numerous
faults committed by the CBI in the investigations as made into the crime
22.           The present petitioner had remained in CBI custody for six
days, but surprisingly during the above phase the Investigating Officer
concerned did not record her disclosure statement about hers concealing and
hiding the crime weapon nor obviously any recovery thereof became
effected at her instance to the CBI. The omissions (supra) are prima facie
extremely grave inasmuch as, despite one Jatinder Singh in his statement
narrating an ocular account qua the crime event, hence inculpating the
petitioner as the principal in the first degree. However, yet the above
memos became not drawn during the course of the petitioner's spending six
days in CBI custody. The resultant effect of the above omission, is that,
“the statement of Jatinder Singh was not then available” with the CBI. Thus,
prima facie it appears that to validate the arrest of the present petitioner, the
Investigating Officer concerned, despite rather post the arrest of the
petitioner his recording the statement of one Jatinder Singh, his taking to
antedate the statement of Jatinder Singh, only for justifying the arrest of the
present petitioner.     The above prima facie antedating also at this stage
makes the statement of one Jatinder Singh to be suspect. Even otherwise,
the non-recovery of the weapon of offence from the petitioner by the
Investigating Officer concerned, despite the prosecution alleging that she is
the principal in the first degree, also prima facie does not connect the
petitioner in the alleged crime.
23.           Since the investigation into the crime event evidently
commenced about seven years hitherto and yet with no headway being made
for solving the crime event by the Investigating Officer except the filing of
an untraced report on 7.12.2020 before the learned committal Court. Thus,
it appears that, prima facie, there was an over anxiety on the part of the
Investigating Officer concerned, to somehow close the investigations
through his arresting the present petitioner. However, he has remained
unmindful to an untraced report being filed on 7.12.2020, whereins, the
statements of all the witnesses were reflected, yet then no inculpation being
drawn against the petitioner.        In sequel, the above hastiness of the
Investigating Officer, besides his leaving aside all relevant un-investigated
facets, which become referred hereafter, also leads to a prima facie
irresistible conclusion, that rather botched       and slipshod investigations,
being made into the crime event, rather only for solving the same, than his
ensuring that the role of all the relevant offenders concerned being also
completely investigated into.
24.           Though one Jiwan Singh, a domestic help in the year 2021 has
stated that the deceased had left his home intimating him that he has to visit
the petitioner. But the above statement is much delayed since the happening
of the crime event. Thus, the said statement prima facie does not at this
stage, carry any credit worthiness. Importantly also, when he is not an eye
witness besides when for reasons assigned hereinabove the best electronic
evidence suggestive of the guilt of the petitioner is not available before this
Court. Moreover, when also for reasons assigned hereinafter prima facie at
this stage the petitioner has ably reared a plea of alibi.
25.           Be that as it may, the plea of alibi as claimed by the present
petitioner is accepted by the CBI, even in the untraced report. The same is
prima facie established from the positive results of the polygraph test as
became conducted upon the father of the petitioner. The effect of positive
results of the polygraph test as conducted on the father of the petitioner, is
that, his being truthful in stating about the presence of the petitioner, at a
birthday party and that too at the relevant time. Therefore, any negative
results with respect to the polygraph test as conducted upon the present
petitioner, thus are prima facie unworthy. The reason being that with the
father of the petitioner as stated above assigning truthful answers with
respect to the petitioner being at a birthday party, and that too, at the
relevant time. Thus when the above is at this stage not belied, resultantly the
negative polygraph test as conducted upon the present petitioner, does at
this stage prima facie, become insignificant. Therefore, the plea of alibi
prima facie can be said to be well rested upon the positive polygraph test as
conducted upon the father of the petitioner who has therein spoken about
the presence of the petitioner at a birthday party at the time when the crime
event took place at the crime site. Therefore, also prima facie the belatedly
recorded statements of all the witnesses concerned do also at this stage
become unworthy.
26.           A reading of paragraph 16.40 of the untraced report which is
extracted hereinabove reveals that certain calls, from certain unknown
quarters caused fright in the mind of the deceased. The above is discernible,
from the deceased to the first call replying that “Main Karda Haan Main
Karda Haan”, besides his response to the second call being “Meri Taan
Fatt Gai Si”. The above words reflect that the deceased was under some
threat. Even the above fact is mentioned at page 118 of the petition file,
whereins, in an email exchanged amongst the petitioner and the deceased,
there is a mentioning of some security cover being purveyed besides it being
also mentioned that weapons being provided to the deceased. However, yet
the petitioner getting surprised since he did not apply for the same.
Moreover, a car with last digits “1183” was also found to be available at the
relevant time at the crime site. A 800 maruti car chasing the deceased's car
is also mentioned thereins besides, it is mentioned that a girl and a boy were
sitting in the car. However, he states therein that a bag inside the car fell
down and that when he opened the said bag he saw a diary, and, therein he
noticed that his name with office address and house address was mentioned
as they were contract killers.      The above email as sent to the present
petitioner reflects about the deep trust which the deceased reposed in her.
Moreover, it also reflects that some persons were targeting the deceased.
Therefore, when the email (supra) is blended, with a disclosure in paragraph
16.40 of the untraced report, that some calls from some quarters caused
fright in the mind of the deceased. Resultantly, it can be concluded that
some unknown persons were targeting the deceased. However, the roles of
all above such unknown persons have not been investigated into with such
thoroughness, as was expected. Moreover, neither the owners thereof have
yet been established nor they have been put to inculpation, despite prima
facie the occupants of the car with last digits “1183” being available at the
crime site, and also when the identity (ies) of the boy and the girl who are
mentioned by the deceased to be chasing and causing fright in his mind, has
yet remained untraced through employments of best forensic/scientific
techniques. Significantly, the CBI does not relate the identities of all the
above to the present petitioner.
27.          The above lack of thoroughness of investigations by the CBI,
appears to be a result of its prima facie making alignments with the
aggrieved.    Though, the association of the aggrieved in the relevant
investigations was necessary and may have also been taken, but, yet with
the rider that the Investigating Officer concerned never loosing his
objectivity and fairness. Contrarily, he has prima facie taken all misfounded
clues only from the victim-aggrieved. Thus has completely abandoned as
was required to make threadbare and objective investigations. Though it
was a legitimate expectation from the investigating agency that the crime
event becomes solved. However, though for certain reasons best known
only to the Investigating Officers concerned, they since the very inception
of the crime event, prima facie appear to only for solving the crime event,
but without any prima facie tangible evidence rather singularly choosing to
inculpate the petitioner in the crime event. The above endeavour appears to
a sequel of the Investigating Agency relegating into the limbo of oblivion
all the above referred defects in the investigations as made into the crime
event. Therefore also it prima facie appears that objective and fair
investigations have not been carried into the crime event.
28.          The CBI is the prime Investigating Agency and has to live up to
its renowned credentials. However, prima facie in the instant case, it has
not lived up to its credentials of being the foremost Investigating Agency in
the country, from whom it was but expected that the most impartial and
objective investigations are made into the crime event, than its choosing to
only adopt the stand of the aggrieved. Though, the CBI could have taken to
seek cooperation from the aggrieved, but only when, prima facie tangible
besides credit worthy evidence to support the aggrieved's stand, did make
emergence.      However, for all reasons (supra) evidence to prima facie
inculpate the petitioner is not available on record.
29.           Startlingly, the untraced report became filed in the year 2020,
whereas, the investigation was handed over to the CBI in the year 2015.
Therefore, than the CBI employing the best scientific techniques to
inculpate the real offenders, has prima facie chosen to ill indulge in taking
the services of tutored and planted witnesses rather merely for solving the
crime event through causing the arrest of the present petitioner.
30.           Nonetheless, justice has to be done to the aggrieved, and in that
regard, the Investigating Officer may in his wisdom but with the leave of
the Court concerned, make threadbare further investigations in respect of all
the above uninvestigated facets relating to the crime event. The judicial
conscience of this Court feels that the above further investigations may
ultimately result in all the offenders concerned being brought to inculpation.
Moreover, also hence complete justice would be done to the aggrieved
besides to the society at large.
31.           Therefore, this Court becomes constrained to admit the present
petitioner to regular bail, especially when at this stage, no evidence has been
adduced by the Investigating Agency, suggestive that in the event of the bail
petitioner being enlarged on regular bail, there is every likelihood of hers
fleeing from justice, and/or, tampering with prosecution evidence.
32.           In aftermath, the instant bail petition is allowed, and, the
present petitioner is ordered to be released from judicial custody,
i)    subject to hers furnishing personal and surety
bonds in the sum of Rs.2 lakhs each to the
satisfaction of the learned trial Judge concerned;
ii)   hers making an undertaking before the learned trial
Judge that she shall not tamper with prosecution
evidence, nor shall influence the prosecution
witnesses besides also hers undertaking to appear
before the learned trial Court concerned, as and
when directed to make her personal appearance
unless validly exempted;
iii)  she shall forthwith deposit her passport with the
Investigating Officer concerned and shall leave to
foreign lands but with the permission of the Court.
33.          The afore observations are meant only for the disposal of the
present petition, and, shall have no bearing on the merits of the trial arising
from the FIR (supra).
34.          The records of the learned committal Court be returned
forthwith. Moreover, the records of the CBI be also returned forthwith to
the learned counsel for the CBI.
