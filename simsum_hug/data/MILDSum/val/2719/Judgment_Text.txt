2.               The  appellant   is  before   this   Court   assailing   the  judgment
dated 11.10.2017 passed by the High Court of Judicature at Bombay,
Bench at Aurangabad.
3.               No  doubt,   as   indicated    by   the   learned   counsel   for  the
Respondent-Insurance Company, what has been assailed herein, is
only the Order passed in the Review Petition and the Order passed
in the Appeal, has not been assailed. Even that be so, we deem it
appropriate to consider the instant case for the reason that the
only              issue   for   consideration     herein,    is  as   to   whether  the
Respondent-Insurance                Company    should    be   directed   to   “pay  and
recover” in the facts arising in the case.
4.               In  that  view,   we  have   heard   the   learned   counsel  for  the
parties and perused the appeal papers.
appellant herein being an occupant of the Truck, which was involved
in the said accident, bearing number as                      MH-12/CH-4001 are not in
dispute. The said vehicle had dashed against the Truck bearing
number MH-12/7830. The appellant-claimant had thus, contended that
the driver of the vehicle in which the appellant was traveling, was
rash and negligent, which had in turn, caused the accident.
6.   It is in that background that the matter had proceeded before
the Tribunal, and the Tribunal having held that the driver of the
vehicle  bearing  number  MH-12/CH-4001  guilty  of   being rash   and
negligent, had fixed the liability in such manner.
7.   However,  considering   the  fact  that  the   appellant  was   a
gratuitous passenger in the said vehicle, the Respondent-Insurance
Company was not liable to reimburse the compensation. Though, the
Motor Accidents Claims Tribunal (for short ‘MACT’) had not taken
this aspect of the appellant being a gratuitous passenger into
consideration, the High Court while considering the appeal filed by
the respondent-Insurance Company, had arrived at the conclusion
that the Insurance Company is not liable to pay the compensation.
It is in that view, the appellant had filed a review petition,
which was also dismissed.
8.   Hence, the only aspect for our consideration herein, is as to
whether in the facts and circumstances of the present case, an
order to direct the Insurance Company to “pay and recover”, is
required to be made. On this aspect, the law is well settled that
if the liability of the Insurance Company is decided and they are
held not to be liable, ordinarily, there shall be no direction to
“pay and recover”. However, in the facts and circumstances arising
in each case, appropriate orders are required to be made by this
Court to meet the ends of justice.
9.   In the instant case, the appellant has relied on the judgment
dated 21.02.2017 passed by this Court in Civil Appeal No(s).3047 of
2017 titled as “Manuara Khatun & Ors. Vs. Rajesh Kr. Singh & Ors”.
In the said case also, a Bench of this Court, having referred to
the earlier decisions in Para-15 and 16 of that Judgment, has
concluded  that   normally, there   would  be  no   order to  “pay  and
recover”. However, in the said facts, this Court, to meet the ends
of justice, had taken into consideration the fact situation though,
the claimant therein, was a ‘gratuitous passenger’ and had kept in
view that the benevolent object of the Act and had directed the
payment by the Insurance Company and to recover the amount.
10.  Therefore, on the legal aspect, it is clear that in all cases
such order of “pay and recover” would not arise when the Insurance
Company is not liable but would, in the facts and circumstances, be
considered by this Court to meet the ends of justice.
11.  If this aspect of the matter is kept view, in the instant
facts, it is noticed that the appellant, as on the date of the
accident, was aged about 19 years and due to the injuries suffered
in the accident by him, his left leg was amputated below the knee.
12.  Even, if the contention that the appellant was in the vehicle
getting   trained   to   be  as   a   cleaner,   is   not  taken   into
consideration, the fact remains that any other avocation that is to
be undertaken by the appellant would involve physical labour which
the appellant will not be able to perform and in such circumstance,
if the appellant is not able to realise the amount of compensation
awarded in his favour at this stage from the owner of the vehicle,
the appellant would be prejudiced. However, the Insurance Company,
if ordered to pay to the appellant and recover it from the owner of
the vehicle, it would not be prejudiced to that extent.
13.   Therefore, keeping all aspects in view, and not making this
case as a precedent, but, only to serve the ends of justice in the
facts   of  this  case,  we  direct   that   respondent    no.1   (Insurance
Company) to deposit the compensation amount before the MACT within
eight   weeks  from  the  date   of  the   receipt   of   a   copy  of   this
judgment,    whereupon,  the   MACT   shall    disburse     the   amount   of
compensation to the appellant.
14.   The  respondent   no.1   (Insurance    Company)    is    reserved   the
liberty to recover the compensation from the owner of the vehicle.
15.   In terms of the above directions, the appeal is disposed of.
16.   Pending application(s), if any, shall stand disposed of.
