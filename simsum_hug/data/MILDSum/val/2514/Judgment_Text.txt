2.    This appeal challenges the judgment and order dated 09-05-2014
passed by the High Court of Chhatisgarh at Bilaspur in Criminal Appeal No.
3. On the reporting made by PW-2 Thuran Singh, father of one Shiv Kumar
Khairwar that his son had gone to a Paddy Milling Centre at about 3.00 p.m.
on 13.01.1997 and had since then been missing, a crime against unknown
persons was registered. After the body of said Shiv Kumar Khairwar was
recovered from a pond on 17.01.1997, the crime was converted to one under
Section 302 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 (‘the IPC’, for short).
4.     The appellant came to be arrested in said crime on 20.01.1997 and
soon after his arrest, certain recoveries on the strength of his statement were
stated to have been effected.
5.     Leaving aside the recoveries, the prosecution principally relied upon
the testimony of following witnesses:
(A)    PW-3 Birja Singh, younger brother of the deceased, was a
student of Vth class when he was examined. The witness stated that on the
relevant day he had gone along with the deceased on a bicycle for milling of
paddy; and that after the paddy was milled at the place one Ullekh Prasad, he
went home with the milled paddy, while the deceased remained at the place
(B)    PW-8 Ullekh Prasad in his examination in Chief stated as under:
“1.     The incident had occurred about one and quarter year
back. Shiv Kumar , Birja Singh and Bisan Singh had come to my
mill for the purpose of grinding the paddy. After grinding one
gunny bag paddy I had allowed him to go. Birja and Bisan Singh
went with the rice bag. At the hotel of Laxman, Shiv Kumar ate
the snacks. After sometimes I saw that Shiv Kumar had gone with
(C)   PW-19 Rajkeshwar in his examination-in-chief stated that he
had lent his bicycle to the deceased but the bicycle was not returned.
Neither Bisan Singh nor anyone from the hotel of Laxman was
Recoveries comprised of a key of bicycle, the weapon of offence as
well as blood-stained clothes of the deceased and the appellant.
6.     Relying on the evidence led by the Prosecution, the Trial Court
convicted the appellant under Sections 302 and 201 of the IPC and awarded
him life sentence under the first count and imprisonment for seven years
under the second count.
7.     The appellant being aggrieved, filed Criminal Appeal No.650 of 1999
in the High Court, which came to be dismissed by the judgment and order
presently under challenge.
8.     Ms. Minakshi Vij, learned advocate whose services have been
engaged by the Supreme Court Legal Services Committee to appear on
behalf of the appellant submits as under:-
(i)    In a case based on circumstantial evidence, the prosecution had not
alleged any motive on part of the appellant to commit murder of the
deceased.
(ii)   The only circumstance which was projected by the prosecution was
the fact that at the place of Ullekh Prasad, the appellant was seen alongwith
the deceased.
(iii)  Based on the slender thread of evidence of “last seen”, the entire case
was built by the Prosecution.
(iv)   The recoveries as alleged by the prosecution were effected seven days
after the incident.
9.     Mr.    Gautam Narayan, learned advocate appearing for the State
submits that the concurrent view taken by both the Courts below was based
on the evidence on record and that the recoveries at the instance of the
appellant conclusively established his culpability.
10.    In a case based on substantial evidence, motive assumes great
significance. It is not as if motive alone becomes the crucial link in the case
to be established by the prosecution and in its absence the case of
Prosecution must be discarded. But, at the same time, complete absence of
motive assumes a different complexion and such absence definitely weighs
in favour of the accused.
11.    In Anwar Ali vs. State of Himachal Pradesh 1, this Court made the
legal position clear in following words:-
24. Now so far as the submission on behalf of the accused that in the
present case the prosecution has failed to establish and prove the
motive and therefore the accused deserves acquittal is concerned, it
is true that the absence of proving the motive cannot be a ground to
reject the prosecution case. It is also true and as held by this Court
in Suresh Chandra Bahri v. State of Bihar2 that if motive is proved
that would supply a link in the chain of circumstantial evidence but
the absence thereof cannot be a ground to reject the prosecution
case. However, at the same time, as observed by this Court in Babu3,
absence of motive in a case depending on circumstantial evidence is
a factor that weighs in favour of the accused. In paras 25 and 26, it is
observed and held as under : (Babu case3, SCC pp. 200-01)
“25. In State of U.P. v. Kishanpal4, this Court examined the
importance of motive in cases of circumstantial evidence and
observed : (SCC pp. 87-88, paras 38-39)
‘38. … the motive is a thing which is primarily known
to the accused themselves and it is not possible for the
prosecution to explain what actually promoted or ex-
cited them to commit the particular crime.
39. The motive may be considered as a circumstance
which is relevant for assessing the evidence but if the
evidence is clear and unambiguous and the circum-
stances prove the guilt of the accused, the same is not
weakened even if the motive is not a very strong one. It
is also settled law that the motive loses all its impor-
tance in a case where direct evidence of eyewitnesses is
available, because even if there may be a very strong
motive for the accused persons to commit a particular
crime, they cannot be convicted if the evidence of eye-
witnesses is not convincing. In the same way, even if
there may not be an apparent motive but if the evidence
of the eyewitnesses is clear and reliable, the absence or
inadequacy of motive cannot stand in the way of con-
26. This Court has also held that the absence of motive in a
case depending on circumstantial evidence is a factor that
3 Babu v. State of Kerala, (2010) 9 SCC 189
weighs in favour of the accused. (Vide Pannayar v. State of
12.    In the subsequent decision in Shivaji Chintappa Patil vs. State of Ma-
harashtra6, this Court relied upon the decision in Anwar Ali1 and observed as
“27. Though in a case of direct evidence, motive would not be rele-
vant, in a case of circumstantial evidence, motive plays an important
link to complete the chain of circumstances. The motive… …”
13.    In the instant case even on the issue of “last seen”, the evidence of
PW-8- Ullekh Prasad did not give any particulars nor did it establish any
proximity in terms of time. Further, even after the deceased had gone
missing, no suspicion was entertained at any juncture against the appellant
and his name came to the surface only after the crime was converted to one
under Section 302 of the IPC.
14.    The circumstances on record do not make a complete chain to dispel
any hypothesis of innocence of the appellant. The prosecution having
failed to establish through clear, cogent and consistent evidence, the chain
of events, on the basis of which the guilt of the appellant could be
established, the courts below were not right in accepting the case of
prosecution and convicting the appellant.
15.    We, therefore, accept the appeal; set aside the orders passed by the
courts below and acquit the appellant of the charges levelled against him.
The appellant be set at liberty forthwith unless his custody is required in
connection with any other crime.
