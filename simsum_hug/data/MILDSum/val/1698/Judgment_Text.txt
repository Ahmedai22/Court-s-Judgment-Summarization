I.A. 8861/2022 (under Chapter XVA Rule 1 of the Delhi High Court
(Original Side) Rules, 2018 read with Section 151 of the CPC, by Plaintiffs)
1.    Present application has been preferred on behalf of the Plaintiffs
under Chapter XVA Rule 1 of the Delhi High Court (Original Side) Rules,
2018 read with Section 151 CPC, 1908 for a summary judgment against the
3.    Mr. Abhishek Saket, learned counsel accepts notice on behalf of the
Defendant and, on instructions, submits that Defendant has no objection to
the application being allowed and the suit being decreed.
4.    Present suit was filed by the Plaintiffs against the Defendant seeking
to restrain the Defendant from infringing the Plaintiffs’ trademarks
‘HETTICH’ and the HETTICH logo                  ,      and          and restraint
against passing off as well as for delivery up, damages, etc.

5.     It is averred by the Plaintiffs that the trade name and trademark
HETTICH owes its origin to its founding father, way back in the year 1888.
Plaintiffs are a part of diversified group of companies, having operations in
multiple countries across the world and engaged in manufacturing,
marketing and selling furniture, fittings, door hinges, runners, etc., which
has led to the said mark becoming distinctive of Plaintiffs’ products and
Plaintiffs’ immense goodwill and reputation has strongly vested in the
trademark HETTICH. Plaintiffs have multiple trademark registrations in the
trademarks in over 76 countries with the earliest registration in Germany
dating back to 1961.
6.     The Defendant is a retail store engaged in sale of hardware products
including furniture fixtures and components. Plaintiffs learnt on 29.07.2014
that Defendant is engaged in selling counterfeit HETTICH products,
whereupon the present suit was filed.
7.     On 01.09.2014, ex-parte ad interim injunction was granted by this
Court and a Local Commissioner was appointed, whose report bears
testimony to the fact that Defendant was in possession of counterfeit
products bearing the HETTICH trademarks.
8.     Learned counsel for the Plaintiffs submits that in the written statement
filed by the Defendant, the only defence taken is that it has not engaged in
procuring or selling the counterfeit products but has sold those which were
available in the store believing them to be genuine products emanating from
the Plaintiffs. Since the Defendant has not sought to challenge the Plaintiffs’
exclusive rights over the HETTICH trademarks, it has no basis to resist a
decree of permanent injunction. In view of this, there remains no need to
record evidence to determine whether the Plaintiffs are the registered

proprietors of the HETTICH trademarks or whether the Plaintiffs are
entitled to a decree restraining the Defendant from selling counterfeit
products under the said trademark.
9.      It is thus the contention of the learned counsel for the Plaintiffs that
the Defendant has no real prospect of defending the claims of infringement
and resisting a decree of permanent injunction against the Defendant and the
relief should be summarily decided in favour of the Plaintiffs.
10.     I have heard the learned counsels for the parties and perused the
record.
11.     Aptly encapsulated the case of Plaintiffs is that trademark and trade
name, ‘HETTICH’, owes its origin to Plaintiffs’ founding father, Mr. Karl-
Hettich, who had developed and mechanized the production of anchor
escapements for Black-Forest cuckoo clocks in the year 1888. This business
legacy was carried forward by Mr. August Hettich, who had developed a
production line for piano hinges in the year 1928. This led to the genesis of
the Plaintiffs’ business, which has expanded globally over the decades and
has become popular under the trade mark and trade name ‘HETTICH’.
12.     Plaintiffs are part of a diversified group of companies, having
operations in multiple countries across the world and engaged in
manufacturing, marketing and selling furniture fittings like door hinges,
runners and drawers, hardware systems/items for modular kitchens,
residential and office segments, etc. Due to Plaintiffs’ immense success and
popularity across the globe, Plaintiffs are recognized as global leaders in
furniture fittings industry. Notably, each member of Plaintiffs’ group of
companies uses the mark ‘HETTICH’ as part of their corporate/trade name
and the trademark HETTICH is also extensively and prominently used on

and in association with, Plaintiffs’ furniture fittings. This has led to the mark
‘HETTICH’ becoming extremely distinctive of Plaintiffs’ products and
Plaintiffs’ immense goodwill and reputation has become strongly vested in
the trademark ‘HETTICH’. Due to long, continuous and extensive use of the
trademark HETTICH by the Plaintiffs in India, members of the public, on
coming across any product bearing identical or similar mark, are likely to be
confused into believing that the product emanates from the Plaintiffs or is
associated with them.
13.     Apart from the common law rights vested in the Plaintiffs, Plaintiffs
and their group companies have also sought and secured multiple trademark
registrations for the trademark ‘HETTICH’ across the globe. The HETTICH
trademarks are registered in over 76 countries, with the earliest registration
in Germany dating back to 1961. In India, Plaintiff No. 1 is the registered
proprietor of the trademark HETTICH and its variants as mentioned in the
plaint.
14.     Defendant in the present suit is a retail store, engaged in sale of
hardware products, including furniture fixtures and components. Plaintiffs
had appointed the Defendant as an authorized dealer in the early 2000s,
however, the business relationship was short-lived and on the date of the
filing of the suit and till date parties have not had any direct business
relationship.
15.     On 29.07.2014, one of the employees of Plaintiff No. 2, on visiting
Defendant’s store noticed telescopic channels bearing Plaintiffs’ registered
mark ‘HETTICH’ which were being offered for sale, misrepresenting that
the product emanates from the Plaintiffs. As noted above, Defendant admits
selling the counterfeit products and the only defence put-forth is that it has
Signed By:KAMAL KUMAR   CS(COMM) 205/2018                                                      Page 4 of 7
not procured or bought the counterfeit HETTICH products and is selling
genuine     products   emanating    from    the   Plaintiffs. Further,     Local
Commissioner’s report supports the stand of the Plaintiffs inasmuch as a unit
of counterfeit product was found in the premises of the Defendant, along
with invoices evidencing sales.
16.    Learned counsel for the Defendant fairly and candidly states that
Defendant does not wish to contest the present application or the suit and is
willing to suffer an injunction. Even otherwise from the written statement
filed on behalf of the Defendant and the admission therein it is clear that
Defendant has no real prospect of defending the claims of infringement and
resisting a decree for permanent injunction.
17.    Insofar as prayer for summary judgement is concerned, as per the
Commercial Courts Act, 2015 read with the Delhi High Court (Original
Side) Rules, 2018 and Rule 27 of the Delhi High Court Intellectual Property
Rights Division Rules, 2022, a summary judgement can be passed, if there is
no real prospect of the Defendant succeeding in the matter. In fact, under
Rule 27 of the IPD Rules even the filing of the application is not a sine qua
non. Rule 27 reads as under:-
In cases before the IPD, the Court may pass summary
judgment, without the requirement of filing a specific
application seeking summary judgment on principles akin to
those contained in Order XIIIA, Civil Procedure Code, 1908 as
applicable to commercial suits under the Commercial Courts
18.    Practice Direction 9(h) of the Original Side Rules reads as follows:-
“9. In the case of commercial disputes, the Court may, inter-
alia, pass orders as it may think fit for the speedy disposal of

the suit or narrowing the controversy between the parties,
h)     conduct a Case Management Hearing under Order XV-A
of the Code and as part of the said case management hearing-
ii.    explore the possibility of deciding the dispute by a
summary judgment without a specific application for the said
purpose, on the basis of pleadings dispensing with the trial of
the suit on the questions of law or of facts on which the parties
19.     I may also note that Order XV-A of CPC, as amended by the
Commercial Courts Act, 2015, permits the Court to conduct a case
management hearing even during the trial as is clear from perusal of Rules 5
and 6 thereof.
20.     The legislative intent behind the provision of summary judgment is to
provide to a party a remedy to seek a decree, distinct from a judgment on
admission and one under Order XXXVII CPC. As held in various
judgments, the remedy of summary judgment is available where there is no
real prospect of the Defendant succeeding and there is no genuine issue for
trial. The test, therefore, is whether a fair and just determination of a dispute
is possible without trial and the necessary facts can be determined by
applying the legal principles rather than requiring the parties to incur
expenditure and spend time and resources to go through the rigours of a
trial. The standard is not really to see if the procedure for trial is exhaustive
and costly but to see if the Court has the confidence that the necessary facts
and the legal principles applied thereto would be enough to arrive at a just
decision.

21.     Considering that the Defendant is not contesting the suit and perusal
of the invoices and the report of the Local Commissioner confirms seizure
of goods which are counterfeit goods it is a fit case for this Court to pass a
summary judgement.
22.     Accordingly, the present application is allowed and disposed of.
23.     In view of the order passed in I.A. 8861/2022, the suit is decreed in
favour of the Plaintiffs and against the Defendant, in terms of para 32 of the
plaint.
24.     Accordingly, Defendant, its partners or proprietors, its officers,
servants, agents and representatives, as the case may be, are permanently
restrained from selling any counterfeit product and/or any other related
goods under the trademark and trade name HETTICH and HETTICH Logo
or any other deceptively similar mark thereof, amounting to infringement of
Plaintiffs’ registered trademarks and passing off.
25.     Order dated 01.09.2014 granting interim injunction is hereby
confirmed. The counterfeit goods handed over to the Defendant on
superdari by the Local Commissioner, shall be destroyed by the Defendant
as expeditiously as possible.
26.     Registry is directed to draw up the Decree Sheet.
27.     Suit is accordingly disposed of.
