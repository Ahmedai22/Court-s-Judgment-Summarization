―There are cries for harshest penalties but often times such cries eclipse the
real plight of the victim‖1
1.      The present case raises important questions regarding the child survivors
of sexual abuse. Child sexual abuse (hereinafter called “CSA”) has been
interpreted by the World Health Organisation (hereinafter called
“WHO”)as the involvement of a child in sexual activity that he or she does
not fully comprehend, is unable to give informed consent to, or for which
(Domestic Working Women‟s Forum Vs. Union of India and others writ petition (CRL) No.362/93), the
Supreme Court of India; 1995 (1) SCC 14
the child is not developmentally prepared and cannot give consent, or that
violates the laws or social taboos of society.2
2.      In a study by Mr. Singh MM, Parsekar SS, and Nair SN, called “An
epidemiological overview of child sexual abuse,‖it was found thatabout
37% of India‟s population comprises children under 18, while around 53%
of Indian children reported experiencing different kinds of abuse, which
included being forced to nude photography, assault, inappropriate
touching, and sexual abuse.3
3.      The impact of the sexual offence is rightly pointed out inBodhisattwa
Gautam v. Subhra Chakraborty, (1996) 1 SCC 490, wherein the Supreme
Court reiterated that:
“Rape is not only a crime against the person of a woman (victim), it
is a crime against the entire society. It destroys the entire
psychology of a woman and pushed her into deep emotional crises.
It is only by her sheer will power that she rehabilitates herself in
the society which, on coming to know of the rape, looks down upon
her in derision and contempt. Rape is, therefore, the most hated
crime. It is a crime against basic human rights and is also violative
of the victim‘s most cherished of the fundamental rights, namely,
the right to life contained in Article 21.‖
4.      Owing to various emotional, social, and cultural factors, CSA survivors
may not be able to express their feelings and experiences. The main
rationale for this is that children are traumatized and are unsure of the
proper words to express their encounter. CSA has long-lasting negative

5.       Now, to shift focus onto survivors viz, the victim, or more appropriately,
the survivor. In my considered view, victimisation process entails stripping
the survivor of their defences and ends in the survivor reliving the horror
of the sexual assault. The whole process takes root in three laps: before,
during and after the course of the event.
6.       The criminal claims the survivors life, if not physically then affecting their
mental and emotional state. It, thus, becomes imperative that the survivor
of the crime is not overlooked and rehabilitation for the sufferings of the
survivor is not overlooked. There is duty cast on the State to protect their
rights and deliver justice to thesurvivors. This justice, in the form of
compensation, should be given its liberal meaning thereby giving the
maximum benefit and as quickly as possible.
7.       The Law Commission‟s 154th Report (1996) on reforms in criminal
procedure discussed concerns related to „victimology.‟ A whole branch has
evolved to make the victim the focus of their study. The tools employed by
this study include an understanding of the victim-offender relationship,
assessing, and possible ways for compensating the victims.
8.       In my opinion, survivor-centric justice is the key to prevent re-
victimisation of the survivor. The literature suggests that justice for
survivors of sexual violence has several components, such as: having a
voice, being treated with dignity, being informed, and being able to
participate     in    the     justice    process (Daly 2017; McGlynn      and
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8445113/
Westmarland2019); experiencing validation and vindication (Daly 2017)
and having the experience fully recognised as having taken place and being
true (McGlynn and Westmarland 2019); (re)gaining a sense of
connectedness and belonging in society, which is related to being treated
with dignity and respect, and about being psychologically, financially and
socially supported; and for there to be meaningful consequences for the
offender, which includes offender responsibility but is not necessarily tied
to punishment (McGlynn and Westmarland 2019). Justice is not only about
calling wrongdoers to account, but also having them take responsibility for
their actions (Daly 2017). Finally, the prevention of sexual violence is of
fundamental importance to survivors‟ sense of justice. It entails the
transformation of society into one that understands and recognises the
harms of sexual violence and that actively makes efforts to reduce its
prevalence, and therefore goes beyond (though still includes) the
rehabilitation of individual offenders (McGlynn and Westmarland 2019).5
9.      The WHO has laid down how the violence at young age has life impacts
on health and well-being of children, families, communities, and nations.

violence at an early age can impair brain development and damage

children can negatively affect cognitive development and result in
educational and vocational under-achievement.
     Result in negative coping and health risk behaviours. Children
exposed to violence and other adversities are substantially more likely
to smoke, misuse alcohol and drugs, and engage in high-risk sexual
behaviour. They also have higher rates of anxiety, depression, other
mental health problems and suicide.
     Lead to unintended pregnancies, induced abortions, gynaecological
problems, and sexually transmitted infections, including HIV.
     Contribute to a wide range of non-communicable diseases as
children grow older. The increased risk for cardiovascular disease,
cancer, diabetes, and other health conditions is largely due to the
negative coping and health risk behaviours associated with violence.
     Impact opportunities and future generations. Children exposed to
violence and other adversities are more likely to drop out of school,
have difficulty finding and keeping a job, and are at heightened risk
for later victimization and/or perpetration of interpersonal and self-
directed violence, by which violence against children can affect the
next generation.
10. Internationally, as well, the need to compensate has been recognised.
Article 39, UNCRC (UN Convention on Child rights) requires State Parties
to ―take all appropriate measures to promote physical and psychological
recovery and social reintegration of a child victim of any form of neglect,
exploitation, or abuse…‖.India has acceded to the UN Convention on the
Rights of the Child, 1989 (UNCRC).
11. The UN Declaration of Basic Principles of Justice for Victims of Crime
and Abuse of Power, 1985 provided for restitution by offenders to victims
and recognized that State would have to financially compensate victims
who have sustained significant bodily injury or physical or mental
impairment as a result of crime, when compensation could not be obtained
12. The Basic Principles and Guidelines on the Right to a Remedy and
Reparation for Victims of Gross Violations of International Human Rights

to provide compensation for economically assessable damage for gross
violations of international human rights and humanitarian law. 8
13. The Protection of Children Against Sexual OffencesAct, 2012 (hereinafter
called POCSO) acknowledges the importance of considering financial
condition when awarding compensation. One of the most important
considerations in creating this remedy framework is that the claims need to
be decided as speedily and swiftly as possible. The element of speed and
time efficiency particularly gains importance because the victim and
family are in urgent need of rehabilitation. Any process of relief so

IX. Reparation for harm suffered
20. Compensation should be provided for any economically assessable damage, as appropriate and proportional
to the gravity of the violation and the circumstances of each case, resulting from gross violations of international
human rights law and serious violations of international humanitarian law, such as:(a) Physical or mental
harm;(b) Lost opportunities, including employment, education and social benefits;(c) Material damages and loss
of earnings, including loss of earning potential;(d) Moral damage;(e) Costs required for legal or expert
assistance, medicine and medical services, and psychological and social services
designed, therefore, needs to be speedy, expedient, and be made keeping in
mind the interest of the claimant-victim;
14. With this in mind, I shall now consider this appeal.
15. Important questions have arisen on a Micro and a Macro level owing to the
much confusion surrounding the role of Special Courts in victim
compensation under the Protection of Children Against Sexual
OffencesAct. The questions which I need to deliberate and answer are
16. At the Macro level, the questions I am concerned with are:
a)       Under the Delhi Victim Compensation Scheme (hereinafter called
DVC scheme) and the POCSO act, what is the adequate amount of
compensation at Interim and Final stage that is to be paid to the child
sexual abuse survivor and
b)       Whether only a Special Court is legally competent to quantify the
amount of compensation in such cases or whether the Respondent
Authorities-i.e., Delhi State Legal Services Authority (hereinafter called
DSLSA)/ District Legal Services Authority (hereinafter called DLSA) are
parallelly allowed to quantify the amount of compensation on their own
without a recommendation from the Special Court?
c)       Whether a victim of offences under sections of the POCSOcan
approach either the Special Court or the Respondent authorities for
compensation including interim compensation?
17. On a Micro level I am to consider the correctness of the merits of the
present cases wherein the ASJ has convicted the accused u/s 342 IPC and
u/s 6 of POCSO and the child of the appellant has been awarded
compensation of Rs. 50,000/-.
18. The present appeal has been filed by the appellant, being aggrieved of the
compensation of Rs. 50,000 awarded to the victim being the appellant‟s
daughter. The Ld. ASJ on 22.07.2019 convicted the accused and in its
order of sentence dated 30.08.2019, besides sentencing the accused of 12
year Rigorous Imprisonment and 20, 000 fine, granted Rs. 50,000/- as
compensation to the child in lieu of the mental trauma and bodily injury
experienced by her.
19. The present appeal has been filed by the appellant seeking the following
―1. Allow the instant criminal appeal and enhance the amount of
victim compensation awarded by the Ld. ASJ (POCSO), South-East
district, Saket courts in order dated 30.08.2019, New Delhi in
favour of the Appellant‘s daughter i.e., the minor victim; and
2. Direct the Special Court to take into consideration the National
Legal Services Authority (NALSA) Compensation Scheme or the
Delhi Victim Compensation Scheme, 2018 as a guideline while
deciding on the quantum of compensation as directed by the
Hon‘ble Supreme Court in its judgement in W.P. (C) 565 of 2012,
titled ―Nipun Saxena and Anr v. Union of India and Ors‖
particularly in the case of the Appellant‘s minor daughter; and
3. Direct Respondent Authorities to frame/have guidelines so as to
have an accountability mechanism at ground level to ensure that
suo moto cognizance is taken in cases pertaining to the POCSO
Act, 2012 where adequate compensation is not provided as is
pertinent from the case of theAppellant‘s minor daughter; and
4. Pass orders specifically detailing the role/responsibilities of the
Respondent Authorities with respect to enhancement of an amount
awarded as compensation; and
20. It will be relevant to reproduce a brief background in the present appeal.
21. On 08.12.2014, at around 05:30 PM, the Appellant returned from work and
observed that the victim was playing in the streets outside their house
however, after sometime she realised that her youngest daughter, the
victim, was not visible playing in the street. Unable to locate her daughter,
the Appellant started to look for her and soon reached the room of the
accused/Respondent No.5 as he would often call the victim to play there.
On repeatedly knocking, the accused finally opened the door and the
Appellant saw him fastening his trouser zip and her daughter putting her
pants up. The Appellant immediately took the victim home and on
enquiring, the victim disclosed that the accused had forcefully committed
penetrative sexual assault with her. On receiving this information from the
victim, the Appellant approached the Okhla Police Station to report the
incident. Consequently FIR No.936/2014 was registered at PS Okhla
Industrial Area u/s 376 IPC and Section 6 of the POCSO Act. The
chargesheet in the present case was filed on 24.12.2014.On 16.05.2015,
charges were framed against the accused u/s 342 IPC and Section 6 of the
22. Pursuant to hearing the arguments from the prosecution and the defence
and after examining all the relevant evidence for the trial, on 22.07.2019,
the Ld. ASJ, found the accused person guilty of the charges framed against
23. The Ld. ASJ, awarded the victim Rs. 50,000/- as compensation in lieu of
the mental trauma and bodily injury suffered by her. The order dated
30/08/2019 issued by Ld. Addl. Sessions Judge-07 (POCSO), states ―The
matter appears to be a fit case where compensation needs to be awarded to
the victim who has suffered trauma on account of penetrative sexual
assault by the convict. The victim was just 07 years old at the time of
sexual assault. Considering the mental trauma and bodily injury caused to
the victim, I am of the considered opinion that a compensation of Rs.
50,000/-needs to be awarded to the victim.‖
24. Aggrieved by the compensation received, on 16.07.2021,an application,
via email, on behalf of the victim for enhancement of the compensation
amount awarded to her was filed before Respondent No. 2 /DLSA and
Respondent No. 3 /DSLSA. The primary prayers in the application were:
a. That the compensation awarded to the victim be re-evaluated and
reassessed as per the Delhi Victim Compensation Scheme, 2018; and/or
b. Pass any order it may deem fit in the interest of justice, equity and
good conscience.
25. On not receiving an acknowledgement from the Respondent authorities, a
reminder was sent on22.07.2021 for the email sent on 16.07.2021.
Pursuant to the filing of the abovementioned application, a subsequent
application was filed via email before the Respondent No.4 i.e., NALSA
on 30.07.2021 to direct Respondent No.2 and 3 to take cognizance of the
case. On 02.08.2021, the Respondent No. 4 directed Respondent No. 2 via
email to take appropriate action as per the Legal Services Authorities Act,
1987 and apprise the action taken for the applicant under an intimation to
26. Finally on 21.09.2021, Respondent No. 2 sent a letter to the Appellant
mentioning that the application filed was not maintainable since the Delhi
Victim Compensation Scheme,2018 does not provide for review. It also
mentioned about the provision for appeal in the scheme which was already
exhausted by the Appellant. Additionally, it mentioned that since the
compensation in this case was quantified by the court, the Appellant may
approach the concerned court for enhancement.
27. The appellant has contended that since inadequate enforcement of the right
of the victim to be compensated (after being a victim of Aggravated
Penetrative Sexual Assault u/s 6 of the POCSO Act, 2012) is an
infringement of Article 21 of the Constitution of India, consequently, the
Appellant, on behalf of her daughter has preferred the present criminal
appeal     seeking  an   authoritative   pronouncement     and   appropriate
directions/guidelines from this Court which will aid in enforcing the right
of the victims to be compensated by the State adequately as per law.
28. There is also an attempt to seek clarity on whether the Respondent
authorities can enhance an order for compensation passed by the Special
Court. Owing to the lack of clarity many a times victims such as the
Appellant‟s child find themselves unable to avail the benefits under the
POCSO Act, 2012 which was enacted with an objective to ensure that the
law operates in a manner that the best interest and well-being of the child
are regarded as being of paramount interest at every stage and to ensure
healthy, physical, emotional, intellectual and social development of the
child who is survivor of sexual assault.
29. The Ld Counsel for Petitioner submits that there is lack of clarity on scope
of power available with the Respondent Authorities pertaining to victim
compensation. The failure on the part of the Ld. ASJ to award adequate
compensation in favour of the Appellant‟s child and the continuous
inactions on part of the Respondent Authorities increases the vulnerability
of her child and affects her fundamental rights against sexual abuse
protected under Article 21 of the Constitution of India, more so, as this
sum would constitute a crucial part of her rehabilitation and reintegration
process, especially while the entire nation is battling with the COVID-19
pandemic.
30. The appellant has taken the position that both the Special Court as well as
DLSAs concerned have concurrent power to award compensation in
POCSO cases and that the DLSAs aren‟t merely disbursing authorities but
also granting authorities. It is also submitted that child victims can
approach the DLSA for enhancement of compensation granted by the
31. The DSLSA in its reply has stated that DSLSA and its subsidiary DLSAs
don‟t have concurrent powers to grant compensation in POCSO Act cases
and it is the prerogative of the Special Court, as per Section 33 (8) of the
POCSO Act, to grant compensation in appropriate cases. Section 33 (8)
―(8) In appropriate cases, the Special Court may, in addition to the
punishment, direct payment of such compensation as may be
prescribed to the child for any physical or mental trauma caused to
him or for immediate rehabilitation of such child. ―
Quantum of compensation
32. To right an injustice is to provide compensation.
"The root of 'compensate' is 'to weigh‘, i.e., to weigh different things
together in order to establish a balance between them ...
'compensation' carries the connotation of providing something
equivalent in value to that which has been lost" (Lomasky 1987, 142)
33.      However, in our society, justice is achieved by deploying deterrence as a
way of punishing the offenders, while the valuation of compensation to
the primary victim of the crime is left to the mercy of the courts/public
prosecutors/investigators. What needs to be addressed is the improper
valuation of the damages caused to the survivor.
34. Two major arguments revolve around the advancement of public
compensation to the victims of crimes of violence. On being, the obligation
of the state and second being the social welfare argument.
35. In criminal justice administration, sexual assault is still seen as a crime
against the state. As a result, unfortunately, the current legislation still
focuses on the prevention of crime and fails to respond to the needs of the
victim. Ultimately, it leads to the marginalization of the victims.
36. It cannot be overlooked that there are social impediments that disable a
survivor of a CSA from fully recovering from the horrors of the crime. Its
impact, in-fact, goes far beyond the spectrum of physical/ bodily injury and
psychological health of the individual but permeates into all aspects of the
survivor‟s life including financial hardship, breakdown of interpersonal
relationships, subsequent withdrawal from society. There is no denying the
fact that childhood abuse/sexual violence makes the child survivor
vulnerable in later life to mental health issues, withdrawal from society,
impediments in access to education and re victimization, thus, there is an
obligation imposed upon justice system, especially in POCSO cases, that
every possible step is taken to ensure that there are no such challenges
faced by child survivors and their families in overcoming such negative
37. However, as of now, I am bound by the parameters laid down by this court
and the Hon‟ble supreme court and will focus on the monetary/ financial
compensation of Victims under POCSO.
38. No monetary compensation can put a value on dignity and no amount of
compensation can undo the trauma undergone by the victim. But it is
necessary to put money in the hands of the victim and family. The funds
will not only provide a sense of safety but also cater to their immediate
needs. For instance, in some cases, urgent relocation of the victim and
family is required while in some it‟s the resumption of education. For the
family of sexual violence survivors, especially in cases where children are
involved, there is an urgent need to spend more time with them in order to
provide some sense of emotional security. As a result, there will also be a
loss of work.
39. Justice Verma committee in its report had stated “No woman in India must
feel a sense of shame or stigma in the event of sexual assault. She is
entitled to the redressal of that injury and that offence and she is therefore
statutorily and constitutionally capable of access to the rule of law.
40. In other words, the victims can and ought to recover like any other victims
from an accident, but that is possible only when there is a due discharge of
the functions by the State.9 I only partly agree with statement. I agree that
the victims must recover like any other victim but rape is personal in
nature. In any other accident the victim is not targeted with intention to
violate the survivor or preyed upon, for instance in motor vehicle accident
the injury is due to an accident hence, to recover, does not require
psychological healing. However, in cases of sexual assault there is
deliberate targeting and dehumanisation and reduction of the victim to an
object. Hence, the state must enlarge maximum benefit to the survivor of
the sexual assault.
41. In my considered view to assess the maximum quantum of compensation,
special courts must depend upon the facts and circumstances of each case,
the nature of the crime, the justness of the claim and the capacity of the
accused to pay.
42. When the act provides two spectrum one minimum one maximum, the
leaning must be towards the maximum. Since sexual violence derails the
life of the survivor, it is important that the compensation must aid in
getting the life of the survivor back on track. Adequate assistance to the
survivor can go a long way in socially and psychologically empowering
the survivor.
43. The compensation scheme states the maximum limit. In any beneficial
scheme/ legislation, there cannot be a concept of maximum. How can there
be price tag on the suffering of the survivor? No amount of compensation
can undo the trauma. The least that can be to help the survivor get his/her
life back on track. However, pecuniary compensation can be of assistance
in the rehabilitation of the survivor.
Justice Verma Committee, report dated 23-Jan-2013
44. In Brahampal v. National Insurance Co., (2021) 6 SCC 512
―The interpretation of a beneficial legislation must be remedial and
must be in furtherance with the purpose which the statute seeks to
serve. The aforesaid view has been reiterated by this Court on multiple
occasions wherein this Court has highlighted the importance
acknowledging legislative intention while interpreting the provisions of
the statute.‖
45. Further reliance is placed upon the decision in Union of India v.
“12. It is well settled that if the words used in a beneficial or welfare
statute are capable of two constructions, the one which is more in c
onsonance with the object of the Act and for the benefit of the person
for whom the Act was made should be preferred. In other words, be
neficial or welfare statutes should be given a liberal and not literal o

dy, J. in para 4 of the Report has made the following observations : (
‗4. The principles of statutory construction are well settled. Words o
ccurring in statutes of liberal import such as social welfare legislatio
n and human rights‘ legislation are not to be put in Procrustean bed
s or shrunk to Lilliputian dimensions. In construing these legislation
s the imposture of literal construction must be avoided and the prodi
gality of its misapplication must be recognised and reduced. Judges
ought to be more concerned with the ―colour‖, the ―content‖ and th
e ―context‖ of such statutes (we have borrowed the words from Lord
Wilberforce's opinion in Prenn v. Simmonds [(1971) 1 WLR 1381 : (
1971) 3 All ER 237 (HL)] ). In the same opinion Lord Wilberforce p
ointed out that law is not to be left behind in some island of literal int
erpretation but is to enquire beyond the language, unisolated from th
e matrix of facts in which they are set; the law is not to be interprete
d purely on internal linguistic considerations. In one of the cases cite
d before us, that is, Surendra Kumar Verma v. Central Govt. Industri
al Tribunal-cum-Labour Court [(1980) 4 SCC 443 : 1981 SCC (L&S
) 16] we had occasion to say : (SCC p. 447, para 6)
―6. … Semantic luxuries are misplaced in the interpretation of ‗brea
d and butter‘ statutes. Welfare statutes must, of necessity, receive a b
road interpretation. Where legislation is designed to give relief agai
nst certain kinds of mischief, the court is not to make inroads by mak
ing etymological excursions.‖ '
42. Francis Bennion in his Statutory Interpretation, 2nd Edn., has de
alt with the Functional Construction Rule in Part XV of his book. Th
e nature of purposive construction is dealt with in Part XX at p. 659 t
‗A purposive construction of an enactment is one which gives effect t
o the legislative purpose by—
(a) following the literal meaning of the enactment where that meanin
g is in accordance with the legislative purpose (in this Code called a
purposive-and-literal construction), or
(b) applying a strained meaning where the literal meaning is not in a
ccordance with the legislative purpose (in the Code called a purposi
ve-and-strained construction).‘
At p. 661 of the same book, the author has considered the topic of ‗P
urposive Construction‘ in contrast with literal construction. The lear
ned author has observed as under:
‗Contrast with literal construction.—Although the term ―purposive c
onstruction‖ is not new, its entry into fashion betokens a swing by th
e appellate courts away from literal construction. Lord Diplock said
in 1975:―If one looks back to the actual decisions of the [House of L
ords] on questions of statutory construction over the last 30 years on
e cannot fail to be struck by the evidence of a trend away from the pu
rely literal towards the purposive construction of statutory provision
s.‖ The matter was summed up by Lord Diplock in this way—
… I am not reluctant to adopt a purposive construction where to app
ly the literal meaning of the legislative language used would lead to
results which would clearly defeat the purposes of the Act. But in doi
ng so the task on which a court of justice is engaged remains one of
construction, even where this involves reading into the Act words wh
ich are not expressly included in it.‘ ‖
46. The compensation as per DVC scheme provides a                         maximum
andaminimum. The statues/ scheme should not decide the maximum. The
court has the power to scale up and scale down. To scale down these
provisions would mean injustice to the survivors who have suffered. These
are the situations which require scaling up. For instance, the compensation
for ―rape‖in the schedulehas been provided as 7 lakhs maximum. In view
of the aforesaid discussion, I am of the view that purposive interpretation
and beneficial legislation requires the said sum of Rs. 7 lakhs to be
considered as a minimum base while adjudicating compensation in
POCSO cases.
47. Hence for POCSO survivors of “rape,” it should be 7 +3.5=10.5 lakhs
(50% of 7 lakhs being added in POCSO cases as per DVC scheme) lakhs.
The final compensation shall not be less than 10.5. lakhs.
48. The special court will be within their rights and withinPOCSO to
adjudicate and grant compensation for more than 10.5 lakhs.The special
court shall decide the final compensation amount and the interim
compensation granted by the DSLSA/DLSA and the special court, shall be
adjusted from the final compensation amount awarded by the special court.
The DVC scheme states that
Provided that the, interim relief so granted shall not be less than 25 per cent
of the maximum compensation awardable as per schedule applicable to this
Part, which shall be paid to the victim in totality.
49. In 2019, vide SUO MOTO WRIT (CRIMINAL) NO.1/2019,10 a study by
the Supreme Court Registrar found that in 99 per cent of POCSO cases
considered, child victims did not receive any interim compensation from
the government.
―7.8 Percentage of cases in which interim compensation/final
compensation provided:
―Virtually, no support persons are provided and no compensation is
paid to the victims. Almost two-third of the cases are pending trial for
more than one year.‖
51. The other concerning trend amongst the Special courts is to award
compensation only if the accused is convicted. CCL-NLSIU‟s Delhi
Report revealed that Special Courts parked the decision to award
compensation till after the evidence of the victim is recorded. NGOs and
private advocates representing children voiced that such an approach
frustrates the objective of interim compensation11
52. In Malimath Committee Report on Reforms of Criminal Justice System
(March 2003), it was observed:-
In Re: alarming rise in the number of reported child rape incidents, SMW (Crl.) 1/2019,
Report of Study on the working of Special Courts under POCSO Act, 2012, Centre for Child and Law ,
National Law School of Bangalore, 29.1.16
6.7.2 What happens to the right of victim to get justice to the harm
suffered? Well, he can be satisfied if the state successfully gets the
criminal punished to death, a prison sentence or fine. How does he
get justice if the State does not succeed in so doing? Can he ask the
State to compensate him for the injury? In principle, that should be
the logical consequence in such a situation; but the State which
makes the law absolves itself of such liability..12
6.8.1 The principle of compensating victims of crime has for long
been recognized by the law though it is recognized more as a token
relief rather than part of a punishment or substantial remedy. When
the sentence of fine is imposed as the sole punishment or an
additional punishment, the whole or part of it may be directed to be
paid to the person having suffered loss or injury as per the discretion
of the Court (Section 357 Cr.PC). Compensation can be awarded only
if the offender has been convicted of the offence with which he is
charged.
6.8.7 Sympathizing with the plight of victims under Criminal Justice
administration and taking advantage of the obligation to do complete
justice under the Indian Constitution in defense of human rights, the
Supreme Court and High Courts in India have of late evolved the
practice of awarding compensatory remedies not only in terms of
money but also in terms of other appropriate reliefs and remedies.
Medical justice for the Bhagalpur blinded victims, rehabilitative justice
to the communal violence victims and compensatory justice to the
Union Carbide victims are examples of this liberal package of reliefs
and remedies forged by the apex Court. The recent decisions
in Nilabati Behera V. State of Orissa (1993 2 SCC 746) and
in Chairman, Railway Board V. Chandrima Das are illustrative of this
new trend of using Constitutional jurisdiction to do justice to victims of
crime. Substantial monetary compensations have been awarded
against the instrumentalities of the state for failure to protect the
rights of the victim.
6.8.8 These decisions have clearly acknowledged the need for
compensating victims of violent crimes irrespective of the fact
whether offenders are apprehended or punished. The principle
invoked is the obligation of the state to protect basic rights and to
deliver justice to victims of crimes fairly and quickly. It is time that the
Criminal Justice System takes note of these principles of Indian
Constitution and legislate on the subject suitably.‖
53. The difference between criminal justice administration and mechanism for
the grant of compensation is jurisprudential. The criminal jurisprudence
lays its foundation in the test of proving the offender guilty beyond
reasonable doubt. Owing to the stigma attached to sexual offences,
relationship between the accused and the survivor/survivor‟s family,
financial dependence on the accused, and the absence of victim protection
measures, it is not uncommon for victims/survivors to turn hostile in court.
Poor investigations and weak prosecution have also contributed to
acquittals.
54. I do not find this approach consistent with the objectives of POCSO. The
interim compensation is mandatory provision. Therefore, an outright
rejection of compensation to survivors of sexual abuse who turn hostile or
do not succeed in conviction of the accusedwould result in ignoring the
failures of the State in protecting survivors of sexual abuse, and in
providing them fullest support as envisaged under the Constitution, the
POCSO Act and Rules. Even in the absence of conviction (for whatever
reasons), in cases of sexual abuse, the child has undergone severe physical,
social and psychological trauma. The child cannot be left to his/her state in
the absence of conviction. As the Parliamentary Standing committee
examining the POCSO bill 2012 had            noted that the “legislation will
remain unfulfilled if both the preventive and rehabilitative aspects
55. The Rule 9 of POCSO rules 2020 reads as under: :
(1) The Special Court may, in appropriate cases, on its own or on an
application filed by or on behalf of the child, pass an order for interim
compensation to meet the immediate needs of the child for relief or
rehabilitation at any stage after registration of the FirstInformation
Report. Such interim compensation paid to the child shall be adjusted
against the final compensation, if any.‖
(2)The Special Court may, on its own or on an application filed by or
on behalf of the victim, recommend the award of compensation where
the accused is convicted, or where the case ends in acquittal or
discharge, or the accused is not traced or identified, and in the opinion
of the Special Court the child has suffered loss or injury as a result of
that offence.
(3) Where the Special Court, under sub-section (8) of section 33 of the
Act read with sub-sections (2) and (3) of section 357A of the Code of
Criminal Procedure, makes a direction for the award of compensation
to the victim, it shall take into account all relevant factors relating to
the loss or injury caused to the victim, including the following:-
(i) type of abuse, gravity of the offence and the severity of the
mental or physical harm or injury suffered by the child;
(ii) the expenditure incurred or likely to be incurred on his
medical treatment for physical and/or mental health;
(iii) loss of educational opportunity as a consequence of the
offence, including absence from school due to mental trauma,
bodily injury, medical treatment, investigation and trial of the
offence, or any other reason;
(iv) loss of employment as a result of the offence, including
absence from place of employment due to mental trauma, bodily
injury, medical treatment, investigation and trial of the offence,
(v) the relationship of the child to the offender, if any;
(vi) whether the abuse was a single isolated incidence or whether
the abuse took place over a period of time;
(vii) whether the child became pregnant as a result of the
(viii) whether the child contracted a sexually transmitted disease
(STD) as a result of the offence;
(ix) whether the child contracted human immunodeficiency virus
(x) any disability suffered by the child as a result of the offence;
(xi) financial condition of the child against whom the offence has
been committed so as to determine his need for rehabilitation;
(xii) any other factor that the Special Court may consider to be
relevant.
(4) The compensation awarded by the Special Court is to be paid by the
State Government from the Victims Compensation Fund or other
scheme or fund established by it for the purposes of compensating and
rehabilitating victims under section 357A of the Code of Criminal
Procedure or any other laws for the time being in force, or, where such
fund or scheme does not exist, by the State Government.
(5) The State Government shall pay the compensation ordered by the
Special Court within 30 days of receipt of such order.
(6) Nothing in these rules shall prevent a child or his parent or guardian
or any other person in whom the child has trust and confidence from
submitting an application for seeking relief under any other rules or
scheme of the Central Government or State Government.‖
56. The Rule 9 of POCSO Rules makes it clear that interim compensation can
be awarded by the Special Court, on its own, or based on an application by
or on behalf of the child, at any time after the FIR has been registered. A
sustained reading of the POCSO Rules along with the objectives of
POCSO makes it clear that compensation is to be given as soon as the
Special Court forms an opinion that the child has suffered loss or injury. In
my opinion, the pendency might be getting created because the POCSO
Rules state that compensation shall be given after registration of the FIR
but do not provide a fixed time limit within which the compensation is to
be disbursed. The POCSO Rules only give the starting point as registration
of the FIR. This gap allows for the delay in disbursal of interim
compensation.
57. Thus, I am of the opinion that the interim compensation is to be paid at the
earliest. Although no time frame has been given but in my understanding 2
months within filing of charge sheet to disburse interim compensation
would be reasonable.Section 357A (5) of the CrPC deals with grant of
compensation to the victims which contemplates a similar time frame.
58. Since the charge sheet is a final report prepared by the investigation or law
enforcement agencies for proving the accusation of a crime in a criminal
court of law, the court shall form a preliminary opinion on the basis of the
charge sheet. The charge sheet against an accused personis indicative that
the preliminary investigation has already been completed by the police.
Filing of charge sheet is indicative to prove that the child has suffered loss
or injury as a result of that offence and is a victim of child sexual abuse
59. The question of whether the accused is guilty or not is not relevant or to
be considered in awarding interim compensation. The focus is the survivor.
Compensatory proceedings revolve around the needs of the survivor, not
on the guilt of the accused.
60. The POCSO is a beneficial legislation aimed at ameliorating the suffering
of children of sexual abuse. The DVC scheme contemplates 25%
compensation,hence the special court must endeavour to award 25% of the
compensation at the interim stage within 2 months of filing of chargesheet.
The special court are within their rights to award compensation in excess
of 25 % at the interim stage. The POCSO is a special statue, passed to
ameliorate the suffering of the survivors. Hence, the endeavour must be to
award the maximum compensation possible.
61. The Special Court, after forming a preliminary opinion on perusing the
chargesheet will grant compensation.
62. I must reiterate that the trigger to award compensation is filing of the
chargesheet. The Special Court must endeavour to, within 2 months of
filing of chargesheet, award the compensation.After the conclusion of trial,
even if the order of acquittal is passed, but if the factum of rape / injury is
substantiated, the Special Court is obligated to grant maximum permissible
compensation, less the interim compensation awarded earlier by the special
court and the DSLSA/DLSA.
63. There are differing judicial opinions on the powers of the DLSAs/
DSLSAas to award compensation to child survivor of sexual abuse in
POCSO cases. This has emerged from two judgments of the Hon'ble High
Court of Delhi passed by different benches of same strength i.e. first in
judgment in W.P.(Crl.) 3244/2019, Mother Minor Victim No. I & 2 vs.
State & Ors,(herein after referred as “Mother Minor‖)dated 15.06.2020
―21…every statutory power is also coupled with the duty to exercise it
and in view of the express provisions of Section 33(8) of the POCSO
Act and Rule 7 of the said Rules (Rule 9 of the Protection of Children
from Sexual Offences Rules, 2020 as is currently in force), the duty to
award compensation in appropriate cases has been conferred on the
Special Courts and it is incumbent on the Special Court to pass
necessary orders for compensation/interim compensation in
appropriate cases. It is not open for the Special Court to delegate the
said power and direct the concerned Legal Services Authority to
examine any claim for compensation payable to a minor victim of an
offence punishable under the POCSO Act…."13
64. Further in W.P.(Crl.) 1419/2020, MST. X (Through Mother and Natural
Guardian) v. State &Ors, (hereinafter called MST X)dated 13.05.2021 it
―(k) There appears to be some dissonance and confusion insofar as the
use of the words ‗recommendation‘, ‗order‘ and ‗direction‘ is concerned,
Justice Bakhru, Pg. 418 para 12
in that sections 357A(2) and (3) Cr.P.C., Clause 9(1)(Part-II) of the
Delhi Victim Compensation Scheme 2018 and Rule 9(2) of the 2020 Rules
speak of the court making ‗recommendation‘ for award of compensation
to the concerned legal service authority; but Rule 9(1) and (3) of the
2020 Rules say that the court may make an ‗order‘ and ‗direction‘ for
award of interim compensation and compensation respectively. In
relation to payment of interim compensation, under Rule 9(1) the court is
empowered to make ―an order for interim compensation‖. To
meaningfully construe these words, in the opinion of this court, a court
seized of a plea for compensation under the POCSO Act, may in its
discretion, do one of three things: (i) if the application is for interim
compensation, the court may order payment of interim compensation to
a victim; (ii) if the application is for compensation, the court may either
recommend the award of compensation without specifying the quantum
of compensation to be paid, leaving it to the concerned legal service
authority to quantify it in accordance with the applicable schedule of
the DVC Scheme 2018; or (iii) if the application is for compensation,
the court may direct the concerned legal service authority to pay the
compensation as quantified by it. Even a recommendation made by a
court would be binding on the legal service authority and compensation
would decidedly be payable, except the quantum payable would be left to
computed by the authority. A direction to pay a quantified amount as
compensation, would obviously be binding with no discretion left with the
legal service authority.
(l)If a victim applies for compensation directly to the legal service
authority and not to the court, the authority would decide whether
compensation is payable, and if so in what amount, subject to the other
stipulations contained in the DVC Scheme 2018.
(m) There should be no confusion that a decision made by the court,
whether as a „recommendation‟, „order‟ or „direction‟, would be
binding on the legal service authority, subject only to the court leaving
the discretion to quantify the compensation payable to the authority or
otherwise, depending upon what is said in the decision.”
65. Due to the contradicting opinion on the scope of powers of DSLSA/ DLSA
and Special Courts as mentioned above, it is unclear as to how a minor
survivor of child sexual abuseis supposed to be compensated i.e.;
a. Whether a victim of offences under sections of the POCSO, 2012 can
approach either the Special Court or the Respondent authorities for
b. Whether only a Special Court alone is responsible to quantify the
amount of compensation in such cases?
66. The challenge in MST X was regarding which authority is to compensate
the victim. The challenge was whether the DVC scheme will apply to the
Special Court when assessing the compensation. The judgment MST X
merely answers this question, and states that:
(f) Insofar as the State of Delhi is concerned, if a victim applies for
compensation to the DLSA or DSLSA, the concerned authority is
required to assess and pay compensation under and in accordance
with the DVC Scheme 2018; however, if a victim applies for
compensation under section 33(8) before the special POCSO court,
the DVC Scheme 2018 is not binding but serves merely as a
‗guideline‘ for the court to assess and pay compensation, whether at
the interim or final stage. This position is in conformity with the
mandate of the Hon‘ble Supreme Court in Nipun Saxena (supra);
67. It is clear from the above that the controversy in the above case was
whether Delhi Victim Compensation Scheme was binding on the Special
Court as well. The Court was only concerned with harmonizing the scheme
and the Judgment rendered in W.P.(Crl.) 3244/2019, Mother Minor Victim
No. I & 2 vs. State &Ors., dated 15.06.2020, especially because the court
in MST X (supra) opined that the court in Mother Minor (supra) was not
apprised of the DVC scheme.
68. The Hon‟ble Judge delved into the provisions of the scheme vis-a-vis the
POCSO and Rules and interpreted the same.
69. On the other hand, the controversy before me revolves around adjudicating
which is the proper authority-“Special Court orDSLSA/ DLSA” to assess
70. The Hon‟ble Supreme Court in its judgment in W.P. (C) 565 of 2012, titled
“Nipun Saxena and Anr. vs Union of India and Ors‖(2019) 2 SCC
703directed that till the framing of a compensation scheme specifically for
child victims in POCSO cases is not in place, the NALSA Compensation
Scheme for Women Victims/Survivors of Sexual Assault/Other Crimes,
2018 (hereinafter „NALSA COMPENSATION SCHEME‟) shall act as
guideline to Special Courts to award compensation to child victims of
sexual abuse.
71. In Nipun Saxena (supra), vide order dated 11.12.2018, the Supreme Court
recognized the exclusive power of Special Courts constituted under
POCSO Act to grant compensation to child victims of sexual abuse by
"The Special Court upon receipt of information as to commission
of any offence under the Act by registration of FIR shall on his
own or on the application of the victim make enquiry as to the
immediate needs of the child for relief or rehabilitation and upon
giving an opportunity of hearing to the State and other affected
parties including the victim pass appropriate order for interim
compensation and/or rehabilitation of the child. In conclusion of
proceeding, whether the accused is convicted or not, or in cases
where the accused has not been traced or had absconded, the
Special Court being satisfied that the victim had suffered loss or
injury due to commission of the offence shall award just and
reasonable compensation in favour of the victim. The quantum
of the compensation shall be fixed taking into consideration the
loss and injury suffered by the victim and other related factors
as laid down in Rule 7(3) of the Protection of Children from
Sexual Offences Rules, 2012 and shall not be restricted to the
minimum amounts prescribed in the Victim Compensation Fund
The interim/final compensation shall be paid either from the
Victim Compensation Fund or any other special scheme/fund
established under section 35 7A of the Code of Criminal
Procedure, 1973 (sic) or any other law for the time being in
force through the State Legal Services Authorities or the District
Services Authority in whose hands the Fund is entrusted. If the
Court declines to pass interim or final compensation in the
instant case it shall record its reasons for not doing so. The
interim compensation, so paid, shall be adjusted with final
compensation, if any, awarded by the Special Court in
conclusion of trial in terms of section 33(8) of the Act."
(emphasis supplied).
72. As envisioned by the DVC Scheme, investigation and quantification of
compensation was to be the sole domain of the Special Court and was
its responsibility. Moreover, the DVC Scheme envisaged the Special
Court to investigate and quantify the compensation. On 02.10.2018,
DVC Scheme, came into effect. This Scheme has a Part-II schedule
titled Schedule Applicable to Women Victims of Crime mentions a
note which is extracted below: -
―Note: - As per order of the Hon‘ble Supreme Court of India in W. P.
(C) No. 565/2012 titled Nipun Saxena and Anr vs. Union of India and
Ors. dated 05.09.2018, it is clarified that this Part shall also function
as a Guideline to the Special Court for the award of compensation to
victims of child sexual abuse under section 33(8) of the POCSO Act,
2012 and under Rule 7 of the POCSO Rules, 2012 until the Rules are
finalized by the Central Government. The Special Judge will take the
provisions of the POCSO Act, 2012 into consideration as well as any
circumstances that are special to the victim while passing an
appropriate order. The guidelines will be applicable to all children as
the legislation is gender neutral. The Special Judge will also pass
appropriate orders regarding actual physical payment of the
compensation or the interim compensation so that it is not misused or
mis-utilised and it is actually available for the benefit of the child
victim. If the Special Judge deems it appropriate, an order of
depositing the amount in an interest-bearing account may be
73. The Standard Operating Procedure (“SOP”) with respect to operation of
the Delhi Victim Compensation Scheme, 2018 further mentions that:
―A.6 As per Section 33(8) of the POCSO Act, 2012, only the Special
Court designated as Children Court / POCSO Court are authorized
by law to quantify the quantum of compensation. The said Special
Court while quantifying the compensation should take into account the
Schedule of compensation annexed in Delhi Victim Compensation
A.7 No other Court except the Children Court/POCSO Court should
quantify the quantum of compensation and it can only recommend
the matter for grant of compensation to the concerned District Legal
A.8 Trial Court while recommending the matter for grant of
compensation should take into consideration Delhi Victim
Compensation Scheme, 2018 as well as the fact that those offences
which are not covered under the „Scheme‟, cannot be considered by
District Legal Services Authority. Thus, such matters should not be
recommended for grant of compensation.
A.9 Trial Court, at any stage of the proceeding pending before it,
may recommend/refer the matter for grant of interim compensation
to the victim. The interim compensation can only be quantified by
POCSO Court under Section 33(8) of POCSO Act, 2012;
74. A cursory reading of the above makes it clear that the scheme envisaged
only the Special Courts to have the power to quantify the compensation to
be awarded to the child victims and forward the same to the
DLSA/DSLSA for disbursal of the awarded amount. DLSA/DSLSA
concerned only has powers of disbursal.
75. It is also clear that compensation under Section 33 and Rule 7 (now Rule 9
post amendment of POCSO Rules in 2020) of The POCSO lists the factors
that the Special Court ought to consider while awarding compensation.
Only the Special Court is entrusted with the responsibility to consider the
factors listed out. This is alignment with the intention of POCSO, that
Special Courts which have the manpower, resources and backing of statues
can consider these factors and pass an order taking them into account. This
also feeds into the objective of preventing re-victimisation of the survivor.
76. The Rule 9, Section 33 (8) of POCSO Act, and Nipun Saxena (supra)
emphasise the role of Special court to quantify the compensation for the
child survivor under POCSO.
77. In Alakh Alok Srivastava v. Union of India, (2018) 17 SCC 291 :
“10. The POCSO Act has been legislated keeping in view the
fundamental concept under Article 15 of the Constitution that
empowers the State to make special provisions for children and also
Article 39(f) which provides that the State shall in particular direct its
policy towards securing that the children are given opportunities and
facilities to develop in a healthy manner and in conditions of freedom
and dignity and that childhood and youth are protected against
exploitation and against moral and material abandonment. The
Statement of Objects and Reasons of the Act indicate the focus for
reduction of child abuse and protection of children from the offences
of sexual assault, sexual harassment and pornography, etc.
23. Keeping in view the protection of the children and the statutory
scheme conceived under the POCSO Act, it is necessary to issue
certain directions so that the legislative intent and the purpose are
actually fructified at the ground level and it becomes possible to
bridge the gap between the legislation remaining a mere parchment
or blueprint of social change and its practice or implementation in
true essence and spirit is achieved.‖
78. There seems to be some confusion in the DVC Scheme, where on one hand
the Nipun Saxena (supra), POCSO rules and the SOP directs the special
courts to award compensation, DVC scheme also gives power to the
79. Relevant clauses in Part II of DVC scheme are as under:
The DSLSA or DLSA may award compensation to the victim or her dependents to the
extentas specified in the scheduled attached hereto.
While deciding a matter, the Delhi State Legal Services Authority/District Legal
Services Authority may take into consideration the following factors relating to the
loss or injury suffered by the victim:
(1) Gravity of the offence and severity of mental or physical harm or injury
suffered by the victim;
(2) Expenditure incurred or likely to be incurred on the medical treatment for
physical and/or mental health including counselling of the victim, funeral,
travelling during Investigation/ inquiry/trial (other than diet money);
(3) Loss of educational opportunity as a consequence of the offence, including
absence from school/college due to mental trauma, bodily injury, medical
treatment, investigation and trial of the offence, or any other reason;
(4) Loss of employment as a result of the offence, including absence from place of
employment due to mental trauma, bodily injury, medical treatment, investigation
and trial of the offence, or any other reason;
(5) The relationship of the victim to the offender, if any;
(6) Whether the abuse was a single isolated incidence or whether the abuse took
place over a period of time;
(7) Whether victim became pregnant as a result of the offence, whether she had to
undergo Medical Termination of Pregnancy (MTP)/give birth to a child, including
rehabilitation needs of such child;
(8) Whether the victim contracted a sexually transmitted disease (STD) as a result
(9) Whether the victim contracted human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) as a result
(10) Any disability suffered by the victim as a result of the offence;
(11) Financial condition of the victim against whom the offence has been
committed so as to determine her need for rehabilitation and re-integration needs
of the victim.
(12) In case of death, the age of deceased, her monthly income, number of
dependents, life expectancy, future promotional/growth prospects etc.
(13) Or any other factor which the DSLSA/DLSA may consider just and sufficient.
(1) Wherever, a recommendation is made by the court for compensation under
sub-sections (2) and/or (3) of Section 357A of the Code, or an application is
made by any victim or her dependent(s), under sub-section (4) of Section 357A of
the Code, to the Delhi State Legal Services Authority or District Legal Services
Authority, for interim compensation it shall prima-facie satisfy itself qua
compensation needs and identity of the victim. As regards the final
compensation, it shall examine the case and verify the contents of the claim with
respect to the loss/injury and rehabilitation needs as a result of the crime and may
also call for any other relevant information necessary for deciding the claim.
Provided that in deserving cases and in all acid attack cases, at any time after
commission of the offence, Member Secretary or Special Secretary, DSLSA or
Secretary, DLSA may suo moto or after preliminary verification of the facts
proceed to grant interim relief as may be required in the circumstances of each
case.
(2) The inquiry as contemplated under sub-section (5) of Section 357A of the Code,
shall be completed expeditiously and the period in no case shall exceed beyond
sixty days from the receipt of the claim/petition or recommendation:
Provided that in cases of acid attack an amount of Rupee One lakh shall be paid to
the victim within 15 days of the matter being brought to the notice of DLSA. The
order granting interim compensation shall be passed by DLSA within 7 days of
thematter being brought to its notice and the DSLSA shall pay the compensation
within 8 days of passing of the order. Thereafter, an amount of Rs. 2 lakhs shall be
paid to the victim as expeditiously as possible and positively within two months of
Provided further that the victim may also be paid such further amount as is
admissible under this Scheme.
(3) After consideration of the matter, the DSLSA or DLSA, as the case may be,
upon its satisfaction, shall decide the quantum of compensation to be awarded to
the victim or her dependent(s) taking into account the factors enumerated in
Clause 8 of the Scheme, as per schedule appended to this Part. However, in
deserving cases, for reasons to be recorded, the upper limit may be exceeded.
Moreover, in case the victim is minor, the limit of compensation shall be deemed to
be 50% higher than the amount mentioned in the Schedule appended to this Part.
(4) The DSLSA/DLSA may call for any record or take assistance from any
Authority/Establishment/lndividual/ Police/Court concerned or expert for smooth
implementation of the Scheme.
(5) In case trial/appellate court gives findings that the criminal complaint and the
allegations were false, then Legal Services Authority may initiate proceedings for
recovery of compensation, if any, granted in part or full under this Scheme, before
the Trial Court for its recovery as if it were a fine."
(1) The amount of compensation so awarded shall be disbursed by the DSLSA by
depositing the same in a Bank in the joint or single name of the
victim/dependent(s). In case the victim does not have any bank account, the DLSA
concerned would facilitate opening of a bank account in the name of the victim and
in case the victim is a minor along with a guardian orin case, minor is in a child
care institution, the bank account shall be opened with the Superintendent of the
Institution as Guardian. However, in case the victim is a foreign national or a
refugee, the compensation can be disbursed by way of cash cards.
Interim amount shall be disbursed in full. However, as far as the final
compensation amount is concerned, 75% (seventy five percent) of the same shall be
put in a fixed deposit for a minimum period of three years and the remaining 25%
(twenty five percent) shall be available for utilization and initial expenses by the
victim/dependent(s), as the case may be.
(2) In the case of a minor, 80% of the amount of compensation so awarded, shall
be deposited in the fixed deposit account and shall be drawn only on attainment of
the age of majority, but not before three years of the deposit.
Provided that in exceptional cases, amounts may be withdrawn for educational or
medical or other pressing and urgent needs of the beneficiary at the discretion of
the DSLSA/ DLSA.
(3) The interest on the sum, if lying in FDR form, shall be credited directly by the
bank in the savings account of the victim/dependent(s), on monthly basis which can
be withdrawn by the beneficiary.
The Delhi State Legal Services Authority or District Legal Services Authority, as
the case may be, may order for immediate first-aid facility or medical benefits to be
made available free of cost or any other interim relief (including interim monetary
compensation) as deemed appropriate, to alleviate the suffering of the victim on
the certificate of a police officer, not below the rank of the officer-in-charge of the
police station, or a Magistrate of the area concerned or on the application of the
victim/ dependents or suo moto.
Provided that as soon as the application for compensation is received by the
DSLSA/DLSA, a sum of Rs.5000/- or as the case warrants up to Rs. 10,000/- shall
be immediately disbursedto the victim through preloaded cash card from a
Nationalized Bank by the Secretary, DLSA or Member Secretary, DSLSA/Special

Provided further that in cases of acid attack a sum of Rs. One lakh shall be paid to
the victim within 15 days of the matter being brought to the notice of
DSLSA/DLSA. The order granting interim compensation shall be passed by the
DSLSA/DLSA within 7 days of the matter being brought to its notice and the
DSLSA shall pay the compensation within 8 days of passing of order. Thereafter an
additional sum of Rs.2 lakhs shall be awarded and paid to the victim as
expeditiously as possible and positively within two months.‖
Note: As per Order of Hon'ble Supreme Court of lndia in W.P. (C) No. 565/2012
titled Nipun Saxena &Anr. Vs. Union of India &Ors. dated 05.09.2018, it is
clarified that this Part shall also function as a Guideline to the Special Court for
the award of compensation to victims of child sexual abuse under Section 33(8) of
Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012 and under Rule 7 of
Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Rules, 2012 until the Rules are
finalized by the Central Government. The Special Judge will take the provisions of
the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012 into consideration as
well as any circumstances that are special to the victim while passing an
appropriate order. The guidelines will be. applicable to all children as the
legislation is gender neutral. The Special Judge will also pass appropriate orders
regarding actual physical payment of the compensation or the interim
compensation so that it is not misused or mis-utilized and it actually available for
the benefit of the child victim. If the Special Judge deems it appropriate, an order
of depositing the amount in an interest-bearing account may be passed.‖
80. The driving force behind the POCSO is not only the protection of children
from the offences of sexual assault, sexual harassment and pornography
but also to givedue regard for safeguarding the interest and well-being of
the child at every stage of the judicial process, incorporating child-
friendly procedures for reporting, recording of evidence, investigation
and trial of offences and provision for establishment of Special Courts
for speedy trial of such offences.14
81. The intention behind enacting POCSO Act thus, was to introduce in our
judicial system “child friendly” procedures. The same is evident from its
discussion in the Parliamentary Standing Committee Report on POCSO
Bill wherein it stated that the intention of the Bill is “ to evolve child-
friendly procedures for investigation and handling of child-abuse cases.
The Committee understands that sexual offence of any kind not only harms
SEXUAL OFFENCES BILL, 2011 (Hereinafter referred as Standing committee Report)
the child physically but also causes long term damage to the mental state
of the child.”
82. Special Courts not only have adequate infrastructure, facilities and human
resources to ensure that not only the quality of evidence by child is not
diminished but it also provides for speedy adjudication of the claims. 15
83. I am in agreement with observation made by this Court in Mother
Minor“It is not open for the Special Court to delegate the said power and
direct the concerned Legal Services Authority to examine any claim for
compensation payable to a minor victim of an offence punishable under
the POCSO Act.”
84. My concern with assigning the DSLSA/ DLSA as an authority to evaluate
the claims of compensation is that a body formed under Legal services
authority Act cannot interpret or understand the complexities of abuse, in
POCSO cases on account of in-built limitations such as calling witnesses,
examining on witnesses on oath, summon witnesses, initiate contempt and
perjury proceedings against the guilty parties.
85. The Special Courts under POCSO Act are to deal with adjudication and
thereafter award compensation. A Sessions Court is designated as a Special
Court.16 The provisions of CrPC are fully applicable to the Special Court.
equipped both in terms of legal frameworks requirements and rigors of
Evidence Act, CrPC, and IPC, are all applicable to Special Courts. Special
Courts are authorised to administer oath, call for evidence, examine
witnesses and the facts before it and undertake the entire adjudicatory
process thereafter to come to a figure of compensation. They have the
Standing committee Report, Para 14.2
power to initiate perjury, initiate and recommend contempt proceeding,
which are all lacking inDSLSA/ DLSA.
87. Hence, the Special Court is the only deciding authority for deciding the
quantum of compensation. When the complainant/survivor seeks victim
compensation that is in actuality a financial redress aimed at assisting
survivors in rebuilding their lives after witnessing sexually violative crimes
against the individual self.
88. POCSO Act, POCSO Rules and Nipun Saxena(supra) clearly lay down the
power and the role of Special Courts with regards to Compensation. But
the DVC Scheme also mentions the role of DSLSA/DLSA in quantifying
the amount. This begs the question: what is the role of DSLSA/ DLSA vis-
89. It is only the DVC Scheme which requires the DLSA/DSLSA to be the
authority to assess the quantum of compensation and disburse the said
compensation. In addition to Special Court, the DVC also directs the
DSLSA/ DSLA is to award the compensation. It is clear that the DVC
Scheme was supposed to be used as a referral document. Upon proper
construction of the scheme, it was to guide DLSA/DSLSA in its disbursal
function, not be a source to confer authority on DLSA/DSLSA to quantify
compensation.
90. In order to avoid confusion and iron out the creases in the thread of the
fabric, with which the POCSO Act is woven, I will briefly discuss the role
of the DSLSA/DLSA.
91. From the reading of the scheme and provisions of the Act, it appears that
DSLSA/DLSA at best is a disbursal authority. It cannot, for the reasons
above, be asked to assess the compensation.
92. My concern with assigning the DSLSA/ DLSA as an authority to evaluate
the claims of compensation is that a body formed under Delhi State Legal
Services Authority Act, 1987cannot interpret or understand the
complexities of abuse, usually involving POCSO cases on account of
inbuilt limitations such as calling witnesses, examining of witnesses on
oath, summoning witnesses and holding detailed trials.
93. The DSLSA/ DLSA does not have the authority to adjudicate cases. Even
if we consider that DSLSA/ DLSA has been delegated the power to act
judicially, then too this assumption of judicial power falls short on the face
of the hierarchy followed in the Indian Legal System, that is, delegated
legislation cannot override statutory power. Here, in the case, Special
Courts have been statutorily entrusted to try cases whereas DSLSA/DLSA
has been constituted to give effect to the policies and directions of the
NALSA and to give free legal services to the people and conduct Lok
Adalats in the State.
94. Even if we assume the power to evaluate and award compensation has
been delegated, the said delegation cannot run parallel to the same
adjudicatory proceedings which are to be undertaken by Special
Courts.However, the scheme clearly contemplates the DSLSA/DLSAto
grant compensation.
95. I am of the considered view that any observation on the scheme and the
POCSO Act must contain in itself the intention behind bringing in
POCSO. The POCSO was brought in to protect children from sexual
abuse. It also focused not only on imposing severe punishment on the
perpetrators but also on compensation as restitution for physical and
mental injuries caused and completely delinked it from conviction of the
accused. The POCSO, thus, was also envisaged as a forward-
lookingbeneficial legislation. The same is clear from the Parliamentary
standing committee examining the POCSO bill, 2012 comment:
Confining it to confirmation of a sexual offence against a child
followed by levying of punishment through special courts is simply
ignoring the real welfare of a child victim who may be in deep trauma
with no family support and thus fully exposed to further abuse. Every
attempt both at individual level and society level has to be made for
enabling a child victim to become again a happy normal child. To
achieve this objective, a fully functional and effective institutional
mechanism has to be put in place and that can only done through
making statutory provisions, formulating rules and guidelines.
The Committee is of the view that an exclusive law on protection of
children from sexual offences should have all the allied aspects.
However, mere inclusion of such provisions would not serve the
purpose. It has to be ensured that all the institutional arrangements are
also made fully functional.17
96. In my opinion there are two roles for DSLSA/DLSA envisaged in the DVC
Scheme. While Section 9 of the DVCScheme mentions deciding the
compensation as well as initiating enquiries for awarding compensation.
This section burdens DSLSA/ DLSA with adjudicatory powers while
Section 11 lays down about the process of disbursing the amount.
97. In the light of the above discussion the DSLSA/ DLSA cannot assume
adjudicatory powers of the courts. The scheme which is in the form of
executive instruction and has not been passed by the parliament cannot
confer a statutory body with such powers. The Delhi State Legal Services
Authority Act, 1987 does not itself contemplate itself does not contemplate
understanding of critical/sensitive testimonies and care.
98. The powers of DSLSA have been laid down in Delhi State Legal Services
Authority Act, 1987 as follows:
(1) It shall be the duty of the State Authority to give effect to the policy
(2) Without prejudice to the generality of the functions referred to in sub-
section (1), the State Authority shall perform all or any of the following
(a) give legal service to persons who satisfy the criteria laid down under
(b) conduct [Lok Adalats; including Lok Adalats for High Court cases];
[Lok Adalats; including Lok Adalats for High Court cases];‖
(c) undertake preventive and strategic legal aid programmes; and
(d) perform such other functions as the State Authority may, in
consultation with the 2[Central Authority,] fix by regulations.
99. If the function of adjudication and deciding of the compensation is
removed from the scheme, the only thing left for Respondent authorities is
to disburse the amount i.e. only section 11 remains. Hence, theRespondent
authorities are the authorities to disburse the amount under section 11.
100. The questions that then remains are: what is the disbursal amount and
when is it to be disbursed?
101. On an application made to the respondent authorities, the application shall
be processed. The respondent authority will disburse an interim
compensation immediately and not later than 60 days of the filing of the
charge sheet. The said interim compensation shall be separate from the
interim compensation awarded by the special court. The interim
compensation will be capped at 25 % of the maximum compensation.
102. It must be borne in mind that in such cases, the victimisation of the
survivor does not end with the crime. The survivors are again victimised
by the treatment of the society towards them, by the criminal justice
system and the obstacles they face after the crime. The Standing
Committee was conscious with this thought “The Committee would like to
point out that as has been seen in the cases of the sexual abuse of women,
their trials often lead to re-victimisation and ignominy, as the trial process
itself makes the victim to relive the horrific experience. And, in the case of
a child, due to her/his vulnerability it may lead to further trauma.”18
103. To prevent revictimization as well as to ensure the benefits of the act are
also delivered to the survivor of the child sexual abuse, a broad meaning
must be given when harmonising the Scheme and the Act. As a result I am
the opinion that the Respondent authorities and the Special Court can
disburse the compensation.The availability of multiple fora for grant of
compensation empowers the right holder by giving them an agency to
exercise their choice as well as to receive maximum compensation as
quickly as possible.
104. For a survivor, immediate assistance is paramount. I am cognizant of the
fact that the Special Court while forming an opinion and quantifying the
compensation may take time.
105. There are needs for rehabilitation.A survivor of violent crime and the
subsequent effects it yields on to the family. There are direct needs which
include medical care, loss of earnings and property loss/ damage as well as
the intangible needs which arise from assessing the pain and suffering of
thesurvivor.19To alleviate the immediate and direct consequences, it is
necessary that the amount is disbursed immediately.
106. It would also be necessary to put money in the hands of the survivor and its
family. A violent crime would also violate the safety that a child feels
especially when the perpetrator is from within the family. As a result, it

and      program    evaluation.   Drug   Alcohol     Depend.    2010    Apr     1;108(1-2):98-109.     doi:
would be pertinent to arrange for the safety of survivors of CSA. There is
also a need to cater to their educational needs. The petitioner's family
would also need to spend more time with the survivor thereto give the
survivor emotional security, by reason of which there must also be loss of
work. Since the system cannot turn the clock back nor 'undo' the offence,
there is little else the Court can do other than prosecute the offender and
provide to the victim whatever psychological security and sense of
empowerment that monetary compensation can give. Compensation is not
a complete remedy but it must also ensure that the surroundingsof the
survivor are made as normal as possible so as the survivor is not drowned
with feeling of guilt or remorse. In my opinion, it was with this intention
that the Scheme brought in the Respondent authorities to disburse the
amount. Respondent authorities will be less traumatic and more accessible
to the victim. This is where the role of Respondent authorities come in.
107. As mentioned above judgment MST Xobserved that in MotherMinor victim
DVC scheme was not in apprised to the court. MSTXenvisaged an
―either/or‖relationship between Special Court and DLSA/DSLSA and not
an ―and‖relationship. In my opinion, it is only when these two authorities
are put in motionalongside each other that the sufferings of the survivor
can be eased. A blueprint envisioning this symbiosis entails disbursing
interim compensation by both the Special court and DSLSA/DLSA.
108. I do not intend to deny the relief carved out by the scheme by cutting a
forum from the reach of the needy. As mentioned above, this is a beneficial
legislation, thus, what is required of me is to synthesise the existing bodies
for a positive manifestation of the objective laid in the POCSO
Act/Scheme. The scheme and the POCSO encourage a complementary
reading of the both.
109. Respondent authorities, with its disbursal functionality, reinforces the
noble spirit envisioned in the Act and works to keep at bay any delay. To
put it briefly, Respondent authorities act like an essential appendage that
keeps the machinery going. The survivors may knock at the doors of
either Respondent authorities and the Special Courts without any fear of
not getting any redressal.
110. Now to lay open the operation of the bodies for functioning:
111. Respondent authorities are to disburse 25% of the maximum amount as
theinterim compensationwithin 60 daysof filing of the charge sheet.
112. The Respondent authorities will only be a disbursal authority and will not
perform any adjudicatory function.
113. Moving on to the Special Court's: The Court‟s shall adjudicate the
compensatory proceedings, form a preliminary opinion and grant an
interim compensation with primary objective to rehabilitate. It shall award
interim compensation which 25% of the maximum compensation as
interim compensation. It can even exceed 25% of the maximum
compensation as interim compensation after giving reasons. The interim
compensation awarded by the special court and DLSA/DSLSA shall be
adjusted from the Final compensation.
114. The Respondent authorities, on being supplied with the charge sheet will
release the funds immediately not later than 60 days, in its confined role of
disbursing the 25 % of the maximum compensation. There is no need for
an opinion to be formed. Respondent authorities thus can only be the body
to disburse the compensation.
115. Thus, the endeavour of the Special Court and DSLSA/DLSA to disburse
the compensation at the interim stage will ensure maximum reach of the
benefit by reconciling the essence of the Act and the Scheme.
116. With regard to the compensation provided by the Ld. ASJ (POCSO), I am
of the opinion that the Ld. ASJ (POCSO) has failed to provide any
reasoning for awarding the amount of Rs. 50,000 as compensation.Even
after finding the accused person guilty of the offences underu/s 342 IPC &
Section 6 of the POCSO.
117. The Hon‟ble Apex Court in criminal appeal no 6287 of 2011 vide order
dated 03.05.2013 titled “Ankush Shivaji Gaikwad v. State of Maharashtra,
(2013) 6 SCC 770 ‖ observed that:
―66. To sum up : while the award or refusal of compensation in a
particular case may be within the court's discretion, there exists a
mandatory duty on the court to apply its mind to the question in every
criminal case. Application of mind to the question is best disclosed by
recording reasons for awarding/refusing compensation. It is axiomatic that
for any exercise involving application of mind, the Court ought to have the
necessary material which it would evaluate to arrive at a fair and
reasonable conclusion. It is also beyond dispute that the occasion to
consider the question of award of compensation would logically arise only
after the court records a conviction of the accused. Capacity of the accused
to pay which constitutes an important aspect of any order under Section
357 CrPC would involve a certain enquiry albeit summary unless of course
the facts as emerging in the course of the trial are so clear that the court
considers it unnecessary to do so. Such an enquiry can precede an order on
sentence to enable the court to take a view, both on the question of sentence
and compensation that it may in its wisdom decide to award to the victim or
his/her family..‖
118. In the present case the impugned order does not disclose that judicial
parameters which have been applied or give any reasons while awarding
the compensation.The LD ASJ in the impugned order, has come to the
categorical finding that the child is a victim of penetrative sexual assault.
The child victim, on date of the assault was a 7-year-old girl. For the
aforesaid reasons the award of compensation of Rs.50,000 for mental
trauma and bodily injury is highly insufficient and cannot be sustained and
is set aside.
119. For the reasons and discussion stated above, which are not repeated here
for sake of brevity, I am of the view that this is the case where the child is
to be rehabilitated. She is in need of maximum compensation under the
scheme and the act and it is therefore directed that the respondent shall pay
Rs. 10 lakhs (10.5 lakhsless Rs. 50,000 if already paid), in terms of
schedule II within 4 weeks of passing of this order.
120. As already observed the Registrar, Supreme Court in Suo Motu(supra),
99% of survivors do not receive interim compensation. This means not
only have they undergone trauma of the incident but also have to deal with
the fall out of the incident. In any case, the victim should never be made to
suffer of the consequences of the act which weren‟t his/ her fault. To that
end, DSLSA will file quarterly report on the cases wherein interim final
compensation has been granted and the time taken by DSLSA to disburse
the said amount. The Special Courts should also file yearly report on the
number of number of cases interim compensation and final compensation
granted. The reports shall be filed with Registrar -General, Delhi High
Court for monitoring purposes.
121. In view of the discussion, the questions are answered as under:
a) Maximum compensation laid down in the schedule is to be considered
minimum.
b) The final compensation to survivor of child sexual abuse should be the
maximum amount mentioned in the schedule. For instance, for “rape‖
maximum compensation mentioned is 7 lakhs. Since the cases are under
POCSO, the CSA survivor is also entitled to7 lakhs +50% of 7 lakhs
i.e., 10.5 lakhs. This is to be awarded by the Special Court and to be
disbursed by DSLSA/DLSA.
c) Within 8 weeks of the filing of chargesheet, Special courts will form an
opinion and it will release 25% of the maximum awardable
compensation for rehabilitation to child survivor of CSA for
rehabilitation. If the Special Court is of the opinion that 25% will not
meet the rehabilitative needs of the survivor, it can award more than
25%. However, it will give reasons for awarding more than 25%. This
interim compensation will be in addition to the interim compensation
(amounting to 25% of the maximum amount) disbursed by the
d) Every POCSO FIR will concurrently be sent to both Member Secretary
DSLSA and Special Court.
e) The DSLSA/ DSLA will be also supplied with the copy of chargesheet
and on the basis of the chargesheet, the DSLSA/DSLA immediately and
not later than 60 days, release 25% to the survivors. The same can be
through the survivor or the parents to be used for the benefit,
rehabilitation, integration of the survivor for the child survivor of CSA.
f) The interim compensations awarded by the DSLSA/DLSA and Special
Court is to be adjusted from the final compensation awarded by the
Special court.
With these observations, the appeal is disposed of.
