2       These appeals arise from a judgment dated 4 March 2022 of a Division Bench
at the Aurangabad Bench of the High Court of Judicature at Bombay.
3       Annasaheb Chudaman Patil Memorial Medical College 1 was established in
1990 with an annual intake capacity of 100 seats for the MBBS degree course. The
MBBS degree granted by the University to which the Medical College was affiliated
was recognized under Section 11 of the Indian Medical Council Act 1956 for 100 seats
in 1997. The recognition was liable to be renewed every five years. For the academic
years 2017-18 and 2018-19, the Medical College was not granted permission to admit
students. On 30 November 2020, the Medical College submitted an application for
increase of its intake capacity from 100 to 150 seats commencing from the academic
year 2021-22. At the same time, the renewal of recognition became due in 2021.
During the Covid-19 pandemic, no inspection could be conducted by the appellants.
On 10 May 2021, an affidavit was filed on behalf of the Medical College stating that
there were no deficiencies. The Undergraduate Medical Education Board of the first
appellant, bearing in mind, the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic granted renewal of
recognition on 15 July 2021 for the batch of students admitted for the academic
session 2016-17. The recognition was for the academic year 2021-22, subject to the
condition that the continuance of recognition would be done in accordance with law.
The application submitted by the Medical College was thereupon processed and a
physical inspection was carried out on 8/9 October 2021 for increase in the intake
capacity from 100 to 150 seats. A letter of intent was issued on 16 November 2021
for approving the increase in the intake capacity, subject to the Medical College
submitting the requisite undertaking and documents, together with the acceptance
letter. The Medical College furnished the requisite documents/ undertaking, together
with the letter of acceptance, on 23 November 2021. On 25 November 2021, a letter
of permission was issued by which the application submitted by the Medical College
for increase in the intake capacity from 100 to 150 MBBS seats for 2021-22 was
approved. This was subject to the specific condition that if during the course of surprise
inspection, the Medical College was found not maintaining minimum standards, the
letter of permission would be withdrawn.
4         In the meantime, certain complaints were received by the Union Ministry of
Health and Family Welfare alleging irregularities and deficiencies in the infrastructure
of the Medical College. A team of inspectors was deputed to conduct a surprise
physical inspection on 14/15 January 2022. During the course of the inspection, gross
deficiency of faculty, residents and clinical material, among other aspects, were found
by the assessors. After the receipt of the assessor’s report, a communication dated
19 January 2022 was addressed to the Medical College withdrawing the letter of
permission for increase in the intake capacity from 100 to 150 seats and directing the
stoppage of admission for academic year 2021-22 in view of the gross deficiencies
found during the course of the surprise inspection.
5         The Medical College instituted a writ petition under Article 226 of the
Constitution before the Aurangabad Bench of the High Court of Judicature at Bombay.
The petition was disposed of by directing the appellants to conduct an inspection of
the Medical College by 30 January 2022 and a final decision was directed to be taken
by 3 February 2022. The petition was, thus, disposed of on 25 January 2022, on the
first date of hearing, without a counter affidavit being filed by the appellants. This gave
rise to the filing of a Special Leave Petition2 on 29 January 2022. An application for
modification of the order of the High Court was thereafter filed by the Medical College.
The High Court having declined to modify its judgment, Special Leave Petitions3 were
instituted before this Court by the Medical College. By a judgment dated 14 February
2022, this Court set aside the judgments dated 25 January 2022 and 2 February 2022
and restored the writ petition to the file of the High Court. Thereafter, a counter affidavit
was filed on behalf of the appellants. The Division Bench, by its judgment dated 4
March 2022, partially allowed the writ petition. The High Court upheld the order of the
appellants dated 19 January 2022 to the extent to which the letter of permission was
withdrawn qua 50 MBBS seats. However, the High Court held that the Medical College
is entitled to admit students for 100 MBBS seats for 2021-22 as no action was taken
by the appellants for withdrawal of recognition. When this Court was moved in these
proceedings, an order was passed on 8 April 2022 issuing notice. This Court was
apprised of the fact that after the judgment of the High Court, a notice to show cause
was issued on 7 March 2022 to the Medical College to show cause as to why the
recognition which was granted on 15 July 2021 and the permission to start and/or
conduct post graduate courses should not be withdrawn. In the meantime, the Medical
College was directed to stop admissions in pursuance of the deficiencies which were
noted during the course of the investigation which was carried out on 14 /15 January
2022. This Court stayed the operation of the operative direction contained in
paragraph 37 of the judgment of the High Court permitting the Medical College to
admit 100 MBBS students for the academic year 2021-22. The National Medical
Commission and the Medical Assessment and Rating Board were granted liberty to
carry out a fresh inspection within a period of two months for the purpose of
determining as to whether any deficiencies in complying with the required norms
continue to exist.
6        In pursuance of the directions of this Court, an inspection of the Medical College
was carried out on 28/29 April 2022 for 2021-22. In view of the inspection report, the
appellants have permitted the Medical College to admit 100 students.
7        The position as it has emerged before this Court is that despite the order of stay
granted by this Court, the Medical College continued to admit students for 2021-22.
No application was moved before this Court for variation of its order or for seeking
permission to admit 100 students.
8        We have heard Mr Gaurav Sharma, counsel appearing on behalf of the
appellants and Mr Nidhesh Gupta, senior counsel appearing on behalf of the Medical
9        The material which has been placed on the record indicates that serious
deficiencies were noted during the course of the inspection which was carried out
initially, resulting in the withdrawal of permission by the appellants for the academic
10       At this stage, it may not be necessary to recapitulate in detail the specific
deficiencies which were found, save and except from paragraph 34 of the judgment
of the High Court, which is extracted below:
“I.      Out-patients are only about 22 by 2 PM and in-patients are only about 39% (bed
occupancy rate), even the patients admitted appear healthy and without any significant
clinical symptoms, most of the patients were sent out of hospital by 5 PM. There are no
surgeries and no deliveries conducted. There were only three X-rays and two ultrasounds
done in the hospital on the day of assessment.
II.      The nurses' charts had pre-recorded vitals of the patients and also treatment
instructions as administered in advance till 16.01.2022 (recorded on 14.01.2022).
III.     The patients admitted on 14.01.2022 were not genuine. They were looking healthy
and gave evasive replies. Case records of many patients were not available. In the available
records case history and treatment in many patients were not signed by any doctor or
consultant. Nature of symptoms did not seem to merit admission. Orthopaedic wards had
'admissions' for physiotherapy for knee pain. Basic and essential parameters were not
recorded in the case files and the assessors suspected the genuineness of the records.
Patients were aferbrile and no record of fever was found in the files. In some files the
temperature was recorded in advance till 16th January; so also the treatment given to have
been administered in advance till 16th January.
IV.      The doctor on duty in the surgical ward, Dr. Swati Patil was having BHMS degree, and
she was not a regular employee of the hospital.
V.       In the pediatric ward there were 13 admitted patients of whom 10 were admitted on
the day of inspection 14.01.2022. Assessors opine that the children were looking apparently
well and were having their lunch. Symptoms reported did not match with the records. The
children said they were not given medicines though the case files recordedIV fluids and
medicines being given. When the assessors revisited this ward at 5 o'clock, nearly all patients
admitted on 14.01.2022 were not found in the ward. At 5.00 p.m. the orthopedics ward had
no patients who were admitted in the morning for physiotherapy.
VI.      Census reports of medical, surgical, pediatric and orthopedic wards had even more
serious errors. Daily census reports were entered using pencil. The census report of
obstetrics and gynecology ward in the last five days had new admissions ranging between
three and thirteen. However, on 14.01.2022, there were already 32 admissions till 5 p.m. In
admission list of 14.01.2022 at 11.30 a.m. there were no contact details of the patients with
numbers like 1111111111, 6666666666, etc., suggesting that the patients were not genuine."
11      Notwithstanding the above deficiencies, the High Court, while upholding the
withdrawal of the permission to admit 50 students, permitted the Medical College to
continue with the admission of 100 students. This order was stayed by this Court on
8 April 2022. Once the order of the High Court permitting the Medical College to admit
100 students for 2021-22 was stayed, the Medical College could not have unilaterally
chosen to proceed with the admission process. This is plainly in breach of the
directions of this Court. The Medical College has made an attempt to overreach the
process of the Court. The subsequent inspection conducted in pursuance of the
interim order of this Court did not entitle the Medical College to take the law for
granted. It plainly acted in defiance of the order of this Court.
12      The position as it obtains at present is that the Medical College was permitted
to admit 100 students following the inspection which took place and it has accordingly
admitted 100 students for the subsequent academic year.
13      The issue which now remains is as regards the admission which was granted
to 100 students for 2021-22 in breach of the order of stay passed by this Court. On
one hand, the Court has due regard to the consequences which will be faced by the
students if their admissions are disturbed, at this stage. Equally, the sanctity of the
judicial process has to be observed. We are, therefore, of the considered view in the
exercise of the jurisdiction under Article 142 of the Constitution that the admissions
which were granted to 100 students for 202122 should not be disturbed conditional on
the Medical College depositing an amount of Rs 2.5 crores within a period of four
weeks. The amount shall be deposited with the All India Institute of Medical Sciences,
New Delhi and a proof of receipt shall be furnished both to the appellants and to the
Registry of this Court. The amount, upon deposit, shall be utilized at the discretion of
the Director, AIIMS for meeting the requirements of poor and needy patients. The
amount which has been directed to be deposited by the Medical College by way of
penalty shall not be recoverable from the students in any manner, whether for the
present year or thereafter.
14      The admission of the students is not being disturbed, particularly having regard
to the fact that they were admitted through central counselling in terms of the list which
was furnished by the State of Maharashtra.
