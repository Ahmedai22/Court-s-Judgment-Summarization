4.     It is the case of the petitioner that the marriage of the
petitioner was solemnized in the year 2011 and out of the
said wedlock, the minor corpus was born in the year 2013.
Due to some matrimonial dispute, his wife left                        her
matrimonial home and went to her parental home from
2015. Attempts were made for conciliation between the
husband and wife. Due to intervention of the respected
members of the society, the wife had returned to her
matrimonial home, however, thereafter also disputes had
arisen between the husband and wife and his wife again left
her matrimonial home in the year 2016 along with the
minor son – corpus and started residing with her parents.
The husband filed application under section 97 of the Code
of Criminal Procedure which was disposed of. It is also the
case of the petitioner that thereafter also many efforts were
made by the petitioner to get custody of the minor son but
in vein. In the meantime in the year 2020, wife of the
petitioner and mother of the corpus expired due to Covid.
5.     According to the case of the petitioner, the petitioner
remarried even during the subsistence of his first marriage
and out of the said second marriage, he has two children.
The wife of the petitioner      was residing since 2016 at her
parental home and at that time the minor was aged 3.1/2
years and since then the minor is with the respondent Nos.4
and 5 - maternal grand-parents. The petitioner has made
various attempts to get the custody of the corpus but failed.
Hence as a last resort, the present petition has been
preferred by the petitioner being father for getting custody of
of his minor son. According the petitioner, the minor son
requires love and affection of his father and hence it is
requested to handover custody of the minor corpus to the
6.      Today, when the matter is taken up for hearing,
corpus named Samir along with the respondent Nos.4
and 5 – his     maternal grand-parents is present. We
have inquired from the corpus about his status and his
daily routine. He does not know the name of the
petitioner – his father, naturally because since long he
is not residing with his father. He calls his Maternal
grand-parents as “Mummy and Pappa”. He has stated
that his maternal grand-parents are taking his care
and he is getting love and affection from them and he
has no complain against them. He has happily stated
that he is happy with his maternal grand-parents.
7.     We have also ascertained the wish of the minor corpus
and the corpus has specifically stated that he wants to go
and reside with the respondent Nos.4 and 5 – his maternal
8.     In view of the willingness expressed by the corpus,
and as the petitioner has remarried and has two children
and the corpus is residing with his maternal grand-parents
– respondent Nos.4 and 5 herein since about 6 years,
custody of the minor corpus is ordered to be continued with
the respondent nos.4 and 5 herein from whom the minor
corpus is produced before this Court and the custody of the
corpus has been handed over to the petitioner, considering
the welfare and happiness of the corpus – minor son of the
petitioner. Considering the overall facts situation, custody of
the minor cannot be handed over to the petitioner herein
who has remarried and has two children. In any way, the
custody of the corpus with the respondent Nos.4 and 5 –
maternal grand-parents cannot be said to be illegal custody
and it cannot be said that the corpus is in illegal
confinement. Hence, no interference of this Court is
warranted and hence the present petition is dismissed.
