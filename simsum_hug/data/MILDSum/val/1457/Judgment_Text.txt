This Criminal Original Petition has been filed challenging the order of the
learned XXIII Metropolitan Magistrate, Saidapet, Chennai, dated 01.02.2022
made in Crl.M.P.No.333 of 2022 under Section 156(3) of Cr.P.C., directing the
2nd respondent police to register FIR against the petitioner on the basis of the
private complaint filed by the 3rd respondent/defacto complainant.
2. The contention of the learned counsel for the petitioner is that the
defacto complainant claims to be a practicing Lawyer. The background on which
the private complaint was filed is that during Covid-19 restrictions, the defacto
complainant along with her husband had traveled in a motorcycle without
wearing mask. At that time, police Constables and Sub Inspector of Police
intercepted them and when they questioned them, there ensued altercation. On
hearing the same, the Inspector of Police/the petitioner herein came to the spot
and thereafter, due to the altercation and protest shown by the defacto
complainant and her husband, registered FIR against the husband of the defacto
complainant for the offence under Section 75 of Tamil Nadu City Police Act,
1888 and released him on station bail immediately. Thereafter, on the same
during night hours, the defacto complainant and her husband were admitted in
the hospital as if, they sustained some injuries. Subsequently, she has given a
complaint to R-5 Virugambakkam Police Station but, the same was not taken on
file. Hence, she gave a complaint to the Commissioner of Police. The Assistant
Commissioner on enquiry, found that the complaint given by the defacto
complainant was motivated and exaggerated and hence, closed he same.
Thereafter, the defacto complainant filed a private complaint before the XXIII
Metropolitan Magistrate, Saidapet, Chennai, for a direction under Section
156(3) Cr.P.C. Subsequently, the learned Metropolitan Magistrate by an order
dated 01.02.2022, directed the Station House Officer, R5 Virugambakkam
Police Station, to register the FIR as sought for by the defacto complainant.
Challenging the same, the present petition has been filed before this Court.
4. The learned counsel appearing for the petitioner mainly contended that
the entire complaint is motivated due to previous case filed against the husband
of the defacto complainant. He further contended that the learned XXIII
Metropolitan Magistrate, Saidapet, Chennai, has no territorial jurisdiction to
entertain the private complaint. But on the contrary, he has entertained the
private complaint and mechanically passed such an order without applying his
mind. His another contention is that the alleged medical certificates produced
itself would clearly show that the complaint is nothing but motivated. Further, at
the time of alleged occurrence, the petitioner who is the Inspector of Police was
on official duty and therefore, before taking any action and registering FIR, prior
sanction is required from the authorities concerned. Hence, submitted that the
order directing to register FIR against a serving Inspector of Police, based on the
complaint given by the person who had already involved altercation and facing
charge under Section 75 of Tamil Nadu City Police Act, is nothing but abuse of
process of law. Hence, the seeks to quash the said order.
5. The learned counsel for the 3 rd respondent/defacto complainant
submitted that the defacto complainant and her husband were abused and
attacked the by the petitioner and his police party and they were taken to the
police. Hence, they gave a complaint before the R5 Virugambakkam Police
Station. But the same was not taken on file despite the production of medical
certificate. Hence, the defacto complainant left with no other option than to file a
private complaint under Section 156(3) Cr.P.C. and therefore, she filed a private
complaint. The learned Magistrate applied his mind properly and after verifying
the documents, directed the police to register FIR. Hence, the petitioner cannot
challenge such order. His further contention is that the question of obtaining
sanction does not arise in this case as the alleged offence is not connected with
the official act of the petitioner and therefore, sanction is not necessary. Hence,
opposed the application.
6. The facts as narrated speaks volume about the background of the case.
The main contention of the defato complainant in filing the private complaint is
that her husband was seriously injured and also sustained external injury over
the eyes due to the attack of the petitioner. Therefore, he got treatment in the
hospital. The further contention is that despite such injury and medical report,
the Station House Officer in R-5 Virugambakkam Police Station, did not take
any action. The so called medical certificate issued by the Rajeev Gandhi
Hospital is also annexed in the typed set.
7. A bear perusal of the above documents namely the so called medical
certificate speaks volume about the background on which the complaint came to
be filed. The said medical certificate issued by the Rajeev Gandhi Hospital is just
a prescription wherein, it is prescribed only Paracetamol, Rantac and vitamin
tablets and there is no iota of evidence to show that either the defacto
complainant or her husband suffered any injury, abrasion or contusion as alleged
in the petition and this was the document relied in the private complaint. The
learned Magistrate without even having a glance of the document, has
mechanically passed the order directing to register FIR. If the Magistrate had
applied his mind correctly by taking the well settled legal provision of law, such
direction would have not been given to register FIR.
8. Yet another factor is that ignoring of jurisdiction. Admittedly the
alleged occurrence took place within the limit of Vadapalani Police Station.
Having alleged that the defacto complainant and her husband suffered assault at
the hands of the Inspector of Police, Vadapalani Police Station, there was no
necessity for the defacto complainant to give a complaint in a different Police
Station namely R-5 Virugambakkam Police Station. It is also relevant to note
that based on the complaint, the Assistant Commissioner also made enquiry and
after thorough enquiry, he has concluded that the complaint given by the defacto
complainant was motivated, exaggerated and offshoot of the criminal case filed
against her husband who is said to be a Journalist. Not satisfied with such a
reply, the private complaint was filed before the XXIII Metropolitan Magistrate,
Saidapet, Chennai. It is relevant to note that the XXIII Metropolitan Magistrate,
Saidapet, Chennai has no jurisdiction over Vadapalani area and his territorial
jurisdiction is Virugambakkam alone. But the entire alleged occurrence is said to
have been taken place comes within the limit of Vadapalani Police Station.
Hence, the XVII Metropolitan Magistrate Court only is having the territorial
jurisdiction over Vadapalani area. If the allegations are true and if the defacto
complainant wanted to prosecute the person who alleged to have attacked them,
she should have filed such complaint only before the Court which is having
territorial jurisdiction but, it was not done so.
9. All the above said factors clearly show that the entire private complaint
has been initiated by the defacto complainant only in order to wreck vengeance
against the Inspector of Police/the petitioner herein since he had filed a case
against her husband for the offence under Section 75 of Tamil Nadu City Police
Act for disregarding Covid restrictions and regulations. This Court also finds
fault with the learned XXIII Metropolitan Magistrate, Saidapet, Chennai, as he
has not even seen the nature of the documents. A Magistrate cannot act as a Post
Office and direct for registration of FIR. Registering FIR is not an ordinary
thing. It will affect the rights of the individual and even some times, it will
destroy the carrier of the people. Normally, the Magistrates would direct the
police to file a report on the basis of the complaint filed under Section 156(3)
Cr.P.C. whereas, in this case, the learned Metropolitan Magistrate has straight
away directed the Station House Officer, R-5 Virugambakkam Police Station, to
file FIR which itself clearly indicates that he has not applied his mind.
10. It is relevant to note that the Hon'ble Delhi High Court in the case of
Ramesh Awasthi Vs. State of NCT of Delhi, reported in 2014 SCC Online Del
7832 & (2017) 3 DLT (Cri) 22 by distinguishing the power under Section 154
and 156 Cr.P.C. after referring to the law as laid down by the Hon'ble Apex
Court in the Central Bureau Of Investigation Vs. State Of Rajasthan and
Another, reported in (2001) 3 SCC 333 has held that;
â€œ... though Section 154 Cr.P.C. does not qualify the
territorial jurisdiction of the officer in-charge who
receives the information to register the same, however,
Sections 155 and 156 Cr.P.C. qualify the territorial
jurisdiction of the officer in-charge to investigate
offences within the limits of such station. Therefore, a
Magistrate can direct the officer in-charge of a police
station to investigate a cognizable offence which is
within the jurisdiction of its local area. Thus, a
Magistrate is required to adhere to the territorial
jurisdiction and in case it is not empowered to try the
said offence, it has no jurisdiction to pass order under
11. Therefore, when the XXIII Metropolitan Magistrate, Saidapet,
Chennai, has no territorial jurisdiction over Vadapalani area, ought not to have
entertained such complaint first. Be that as it may. Even assuming that the entire
allegations as alleged by the defacto complainant was true, on the date of alleged
occurrence, the petitioner who is Inspector of Police, was discharging his official
duty during Covid restrictions and was trying to prevent spread of infections by
insisting people who were roaming without masks as such, he was discharging
his official duty on the date occurrence. Such being the position, there must be a
prior sanction to proceed against such Officer. In this regard, the Hon'ble
Calcutta High Court in a case in Dr.Nazrul Islam Vs. Basudeb Banerjee and
Others reported in CDJ 2022 Cal HC 011, has held as follows;
21. ....... Once it is noticed that there was not
previous sanction, as already indicated in various
judgments referred to hereinabove, the Magistrate
cannot order investigation against a public servant
while invoking powers under Section 156(3)
indicated, has been clearly spelt out in Paras Nath
... ... .... Thus, it has been categorically observed
by the Hon'ble Supreme Court that if it is noticed
there was no previous sanction the Magistrate
cannot order investigation against the public
servant while invoking powers under Section
12. Therefore, this Court finds that the criminal proceeding has been
maliciously instituted by the defacto complainant and her husband to wreck
vengeance against the officer who proceeded against them previously. Hence,
this Court can very well interfere by exercising its power under Section 482
Cr.P.C. which has also been held by the Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of State
of Haryana vs. Bhajan Lal, 1992 Supp (1) SCC 335. Hence, applying the
above Judgment and considering the facts of the case, this Court is of the view
that the very filing of the private complaint itself is abuse of process of law. That
apart, entertaining such complaint and directing to register FIR without applying
the mind by the learned XXIII Metropolitan Magistrate, Saidapet, Chennai is
nothing but against law which cannot sustain in the eye of law.
13. Accordingly, this Criminal Original Petition is allowed. Consequently,
connected Miscellaneous Petition is closed. The order passed by the learned
XXIII Metropolitan Magistrate, Saidapet, Chennai, in Crl.M.P.No.333 of 2022
dated 01.02.2022 directing the Station House Officer, R5 Virugambakkam
Police Station, to register FIR is quashed. Subsequently, the private complaint is
also quashed as an abuse of process of law.
