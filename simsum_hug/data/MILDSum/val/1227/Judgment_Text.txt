1.       The petitioner has filed the present petition under Section 34 of
the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (hereinafter the ‘A&C Act’)
impugning an arbitral award (hereinafter the ‘impugned award’) dated
28.02.2020 delivered by an Arbitral Tribunal comprising of a Sole
Arbitrator (hereinafter the ‘Arbitral Tribunal’).
2.       The impugned award was rendered in the context of disputes that
have arisen between the parties in relation to the Agreement dated
3.       Mr Pawan Dawar (hereinafter ‘the respondent’) is engaged in
the business of providing transport services and carries on his business
under the name and style of his proprietorship concern M/s Genesis
4.       On 01.04.2012, the parties entered into an Agreement, whereby
the respondent agreed to provide transport services to the petitioner.
The petitioner owned twenty-two school buses, which the respondent
agreed to operate and maintain. The respondent was required to provide
conductors, drivers, supervisors, cleaners, full time mechanics and other
personnel. In addition, the respondent also agreed to provide additional
buses for the purposes of picking up and dropping off the students and
the employees of the petitioner.
5.       The Agreement was for a term of eight years, that is, from
01.04.2012 till 31.03.2020 with the first five years as a lock in period.
Further, the respondent agreed to strictly abide by the obligations
stipulated in the Agreement such as, adhering to the timing for
transportation of students; regular maintenance of the buses,
maintaining motorable conditions of the buses; complying with the
safety guidelines issued by the Supreme Court of India; limiting the
number of students transported in each bus to the permissible limit; and,
in the event of breakdown of buses, providing alternate vehicles etc.
6.       Thereafter, by a communication dated 07.06.2015, the
respondent requested the Principal of the petitioner school to release the
outstanding payments in terms of the Agreement. He further stated that
even though, the petitioner was collecting the transportation fee from
the students well in advance, however, the petitioner was making
payments to him in petty instalments after a delay of a substantial
period.
7.       The Principal of the petitioner school responded by an e-mail
dated 05.08.2015 alleging deficiencies in the services provided by the
respondent and further, informed him that the petitioner would be
compelled to take strict action if the said deficiencies were not rectified
within a period of seven-ten days. Thereafter, by a communication
dated 03.09.2015, the petitioner terminated the Agreement.
8.        Aggrieved by the termination of the Agreement, the respondent
invoked the Agreement to refer the disputes to arbitration, in terms of
Clause 36 of the Agreement. This Court, by an order dated 04.04.2018,
passed in O.M.P. (T) (COMM) 55 of 2017 captioned Pawan Dawar v.
Millennium School directed the Delhi International Arbitration Centre
(DIAC) to appoint an arbitrator to adjudicate the disputes between the
parties. Thereafter, the Arbitral Tribunal entered upon reference on
9.       Before the Arbitral Tribunal, the respondent filed its Statement
of Claims. A tabular statement stating the claims made by the
Claim 2 Interest payable on the delayed         ₹50,65,242/-
Claim 3 Loss of Profits from the ₹93,97,202/-
Claim 4 Contractor fee due and payable ₹65,13,755/-
Claim 5 Interest payable on the delayed ₹20,98,346/-
Claim 6 Contractor fee due and payable ₹2,91,758/-
Claim 7 Insurance Premium returnable by ₹3,63,980/-
10.      The petitioner filed its Statement of Defence before the Arbitral
Tribunal and also raised counter-claims. The counter-claims made by
Claim 1 Exemplary cost due to loss of      ₹1,00,00,000 /-
Claim 2 Cost towards mental pain and         ₹5,00,000 /-
11.      By the impugned award, the Arbitral Tribunal partially accepted
the claims of the respondent. The Arbitral Tribunal awarded a sum of
₹1,16,16,950/- towards outstanding Contractor’s fee along with interest
at the rate of 18% per annum from 03.09.2015 till 20.05.2016 (Claim
nos. 1 and 2); a sum of ₹3,38,150/- per month from 03.09.2015 to
31.03.2017 as loss of profit (Claim no.3); a sum of ₹65,13,755/-
together with interest at the rate of 18% per annum from 03.09.2015 till
the date of Statement of Claims as extra cab hire charges (Claim nos. 4
and 5); and, a sum of ₹3,63,980/- on account of insurance premium
returnable by the petitioner (Claim no.7). The Arbitral Tribunal further
awarded pendente lite interest at the rate of 18% per annum on the
awarded amounts from the date of presentation of claims till the date of
the award and, future interest at the rate of 18% per annum on the
awarded amounts from the date of the award till the date of realization,
if the amount was not paid within a period of three months from the date
of the award. The Arbitral Tribunal also awarded costs, in favour of the
respondent.
12.      Aggrieved by the impugned award, the petitioner has filed the
present petition.
13.      Mr Sinha, learned counsel for the petitioner, submitted that the
Arbitral Tribunal erred in holding that notwithstanding a material
breach of the Agreement, the petitioner could not terminate the
Agreement within the lock-in-period. He referred to Clause 33 of the
Agreement and submitted that the said clause expressly enabled
termination of the Agreement on account of any material breach.
Further, it was a non-obstante clause and therefore, had an overriding
effect. He contended that the interpretation of Clause 1 of the
Agreement by the Arbitral Tribunal was not reasonably possible after
reading the Agreement as a whole and the said clause could not become
a no-termination clause.
14.      Next, he submitted that the Arbitral Tribunal wrongly rejected
crucial evidence led by the petitioner including the complaints filed by
parents of the students against the respondent on the ground that the
Certificate under Section 65-B (4) of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872
(hereinafter ‘Evidence Act’) did not conform to the statutory
requirements. However, the Arbitral Tribunal failed to consider that the
Evidence Act was not applicable to arbitration proceedings and this
finding of the Arbitral Tribunal was contrary to Section 19 of the A&C
Act and Rule 25.2 of the DIAC Rules, 2018. He further contended that
the respondent had admitted to the receipt of various e-mails, which
were yet ignored by the Arbitral Tribunal on the ground of insufficiency
of certificate under Section 65-B of the Evidence Act.
15.      Next, he submitted that the respondent had inflated the statement
of accounts and the claim regarding outstanding Contractor’s fee of
₹1,16,16,950/- was exaggerated. He further contended that the evidence
showing reconciliation of accounts was overlooked and the respondent
had given its consent to the balance confirmation certificate, which
showed the balance amount of ₹32,59,414/- as on 30.06.2014 and the
said amount was paid by the petitioner.
16.      Next, he submitted that the excess cab charges of ₹65,13,755/-
awarded to the respondent by the Arbitral Tribunal was, ex facie,
erroneous as the respondent had restricted his claim to a sum of
17.      Lastly, he submitted that the awarded of interest was excessive
and unsustainable.
Re: Loss of profits for the remaining lock-in period
18.      The first and foremost question to be addressed is whether the
decision of the Arbitral Tribunal to award ₹3,38,150/- per month as
damages for loss of profits for the period 03.09.2015 to 31.03.2017, is
manifestly erroneous and vitiates the impugned award.
19.      The said award is premised on the conclusion that the termination
of the Agreement was illegal.
20.      On the basis of the pleadings, the Arbitral Tribunal had, inter alia,
framed seven issues including the following:
“1.    Whether the termination of the contract dated
01.04.2012 executed between the Claimant and
4.    Whether there was any deficiency in the services
provided by the Claimant?”
21.      Both the issues were interconnected and considered together. The
said issues were decided against the petitioner. The Arbitral Tribunal
held that the termination of the Agreement was illegal and invalid and
accordingly, answered the first issue in the negative. The Arbitral
Tribunal further found that the petitioner had failed to prove that there
was any deficiency in the services provided by the respondent.
22.      The Arbitral Tribunal found that the termination was not in
accordance with the terms of the Agreement as it was not open for the
petitioner to terminate the said Agreement during the lock-in period.
23.      At this stage, it would be relevant to refer to the relevant clauses
of the Agreement. Clauses 1, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34 and 35 of the Agreement
1. This Agreement will come into force on and from
April 1, 2012 (“Effective Date”) and shall remain
in force for a period of eight (8) years till March 31,
2020 (“Term”) unless terminated earlier in terms of
Clauses 30 and 31 below. This can be renewed at
the time of expiry with mutual agreement.
However, there shall be a lock-in period of five
years commencing from the Effective Date (Lock-
in Period), during which neither Party to this
Agreement shall be entitled to terminate this
terminate the Agreement in the event of any fatal
accident resulting in death of any student or staff;
failure to maintain the Contractor Buses and School
Buses (however, not under exceptional cases of
body work and bus A/C) as stated in the Agreement
; and in the event of misconduct, hideous crimes
such as those under section 354/375 of the Indian
Penal Code committed by any Transport Personnel
of the Contractor (b) Contractor may terminate the
Agreement in the event the School defaults on its
obligation to pay the Contractor Fee, subject to the
Contractor providing the School with a prior
written notice of two months.
30. In the event any Transport Personnel is found or
caught or reported to be misbehaving with the staff
members, employees or the students of School or in
an intoxicated state or not adhering to the official
rules and regulations of School or in the event of
any other non-acceptable act, misconduct, theft,
fraud, cheating or any other unlawful act including
violence committed by the personnel provided by
the Contractor, the Contractor agrees to take entire
responsibility and liability of aforesaid acts and
omissions and agrees to bear ail consequences,
damages, losses and claims whether direct or
indirect, monetary or otherwise, implied or explicit
or of whatsoever nature due to this misbehavior and
would immediately remove such person from the
duty of School. The Contractor also undertakes to
supervise and ensure that its drivers do not indulge
in any rash, reckless or negligent driving and adhere
to all traffic rules and regulations at all times.
31. The Contractor undertakes that the Transport
Personnel provided by the Contractor would not
resort to any undisciplined acts of strike, violent
protests, rallies, or otherwise disrupt/interfere with
the peaceful functioning of School and in the event
of any such occurrence, the Contractor agrees to
immediately remove the erring personnel and
provide immediate replacements to School
ensuring that business at/of School shall not be
hampered under any circumstances due to any fault
of the Contractor or its agents.
32. The Contractor shall withdraw/replace forthwith
any of its Transport Personnel on receipt of a
written request from School, who in the opinion of
School are undesirable. The decision of School
/School’s representative in this regard shall be final
and binding on the Contractor.
33. Notwithstanding anything contained herein, School
reserves the right to terminate the services of the
Contractor, as School may deem proper, for reason
of Contractor not carrying out its obligations set-out
in this Agreement and/or for reason of any material
breach of this Agreement, and Contractor agrees to
pay School the damages resulting out of disruption
of Transport Services in case of such termination.
The Contractor shall be said to materially breach
the Agreement if it fails to provide the level of
services prescribed in this Agreement including but
a.     Failure to maintain a 99% success rate at
adhering with the timelines as per the rosters
students. For these purposes, the performance
of the Contractor will be assessed every quarter.
b.     Failure to maintain the Buses (i.e. Contractor
c.     In the event of any accident resulting in injury
or death of any student or employee of School;
d.     In the event the Buses are overloaded beyond
the legally permissible capacity of the buses;
e.     In the event the Transport Personnel engaged by
Conditions for Transport Personnel’ set out in
f.    In the event of breach of any other ‘Conditions
g.    Any failure to comply with any and all statutory
h.    Failure to maintain insurance.
34. This Agreement can be terminated by the School by
giving two months written notice to the Contractor.
The Contractor can terminate this Agreement only
in the event the School is in breach of its obligation
pertaining to payment of Contractor Fee subject to
the Contractor providing prior two months written
notice to the School.
35. Upon termination for any reason whatsoever,
Contractor shall be liable to refund outstanding
amount of advance received from School.”
24.      The Arbitral Tribunal examined the said clauses and concluded
that the petitioner was not entitled to terminate the Agreement during
the lock-in period of five years except on the grounds as stated in Clause
1 of the Agreement. The Arbitral Tribunal was of the view that recourse
to Clause 33 of the Agreement was not available to the petitioner during
the lock-in period. The Arbitral Tribunal rejected the contention that
Clause 33 being a non-obstante clause, would override the other clauses
of the Agreement and therefore, the same would entitle the petitioner to
terminate the Agreement, even during the lock-in period, on account of
any material breach on the part of the respondent. The Arbitral Tribunal
also held that the petitioner had terminated the Agreement on account
of the alleged deficiencies in the services and not on the ground as set
out in Clause 1 of the Agreement. The relevant extract of the impugned
“80. ….. In my considered opinion Clause 1 providing
for lock-in period as well as exceptional situations
under which there can be termination even during
lock-in period is a special provision distinct from
Clauses 33 to 35 under the heading “Termination
and Consequences of Termination”. I am therefore
of the view that Clause 33 cannot prevail over
Clause 1 merely because it starts with a non-
abstante clause.
81. It is necessary to add that the non-abstante clause
used in Clause 33 indicates that Clause 33 should
prevail despite anything to the contrary in the said
clause. Clause 33 nowhere provided that the
Respondent reserves the right to terminate the
contract “at any time”. But it states that the school
reserves the right to terminate for the reasons
specified therein in which event the contractor shall
pay the damages resulting out of disruption of
transport services. The emphasis in Clause 33 is on
the grounds for termination by the school and the
obligation of the contractor to compensate the
damage. Clause 1 did not provide anything contrary
to Clause 33 either with regard to the grounds for
termination or the liability of the contractor to
compensate the damage. Hence the only conclusion
that can be reached is that the Respondent may take
recourse to clause 33 only after completion of the
lock-in period of five years. The termination, if any,
during the lock-in period shall be only for the
reasons specified in Clause 1 but not on any other
ground.
82. As rightly submitted by the Ld. Counsel for the
Claimant none of the grounds specified in Clause 1
is made out in Ex.CW1/11 and Ex.CW1/12 dated
03.09.2015. At any rate the specific case of the
Respondent is that the termination was ordered
invoking clause 33 of the Agreement but not clause
83. As expressed above, the Respondent cannot invoke
Clause 33 for termination during lock-in period.
Therefore, the impugned termination dated
03.09.2015 under Clause 33 of the Agreement is
contrary to the upon and illegal.”
25.      In the present case, the Arbitral Tribunal’s decision that the
termination of the Agreement is illegal rests on two findings. First, that
the Agreement cannot be terminated under Clause 33 of the Agreement
during the lock-in period of first five years. And second, that the
grounds on which the Agreement was terminated fall within Clause 33
of the Agreement and not under Clause 1 of the Agreement.
26.      A plain reading of Clause 1 of the Agreement does indicate that
neither party could terminate the Agreement during the lock-in period
of five years except on the grounds as stated in the said clause, namely,
(i) fatal accident resulting in death of any student or staff; (ii) failure to
maintain the contractor buses and school buses; and, (iii) event of
misconduct, hideous crimes such as those under Sections 354/375 of the
Indian Penal Code, 1860. In addition, the respondent could terminate
the Agreement, in the event, the petitioner defaulted in its payment
obligations subject to a prior notice of two months. However, Clause 33
of the Agreement also provides that the Agreement could be terminated
on account of any material breach of the Agreement. It sets out the
defaults, which would constitute material breach.
27.      A plain reading of the grounds as set out in Clause 33 of the
Agreement indicates that the same are not mutually exclusive to the
grounds as set out in Clause 1 of the Agreement. Failure to maintain
buses, accident resulting in injury or death of a student or an employee
of the petitioner school are also referred to in Clause 1 of the
28.      Thus, the contention that the Agreement could not be terminated
during the lock-in period on account of any of the grounds as set out in
Clause 33 of the Agreement is, ex facie, erroneous.
29.      Clause 1 of the Agreement specifies the term of the Agreement.
Whereas, Clauses 33, 34 and 35 of the Agreement fall under the heading
“Termination and Consequence of Termination”.
30.      In terms of Clause 34 of the Agreement, the Agreement could be
terminated by the petitioner by giving two months’ notice to the
respondent. The petitioner was not required to give any reasons for such
termination. Clearly, recourse to this clause would not be available
during the lock-in period.
31.      However, this Court finds it difficult to accept that Clause 33 of
the Agreement could not be available to the petitioner during the lock-
in period. First of all, Clause 33 of the Agreement commences with the
non-obstante provision. Thus, it would override the other clauses of the
Agreement. There is little reason to curtail the full import of the non-
obstante clause. Second and more importantly, is the nature of grounds
as set out in Clause 33 of the Agreement. If the interpretation as
provided by the Arbitral Tribunal is accepted, it would imply that
notwithstanding that the respondent fails to adhere to the timelines for
picking up and dropping the students; overloads the buses beyond
legally permissible capacity; fails to perform the “minimum conditions
for transport personnel”; fails to comply with the statutory obligations;
and results in an injury to any student or any employee of the petitioner,
the petitioner would not be entitled not terminate the Agreement.
32.      The Agreement was for providing timely services, in accordance
with law. In this context, it is difficult to accept that the petitioner would
not be entitled to terminate the Agreement on account of any
fundamental breach on the part of the respondent.
33.      The second aspect to be examined is whether the grounds for
termination as stated in the Termination Letter dated 03.09.2015 were
the grounds, which were relatable only to Clause 33 of the Agreement.
The relevant grounds for termination as set out in the Termination Letter
“1. The first unsatisfactory ground is that in clause 8 of
the agreement you have ensured timely pick up and
drop off the students and employees of the School
however You failed to adhere to the timings which
caused lot of inconvenience to the School. The
clause is read as “The Contractor agrees that time
is the essence of the Agreement and failure to
adhere to the timings shall be regarded as failure to
provide the Transport Services in terms of this
Agreements”. We never asked you to pick up or
drop off the students from their door step. We
agreed pick-up and drop-off points meant the most
convenient pick-up and drop-off point to the
student or employee, nearest to the residence of the
student or employee where the bus can reach
conveniently considering the size of the bus.
2.   The second unsatisfactory ground is that in clause
10 & 12 of the Agreement you have ensure that the
School Buses and the Contractor Buses will always
be properly maintained in good, motorable and
road worthy condition and will be serviced
/refueled regularly and tires / tubes will be repaired
as and when require. However, you failed to
maintain the Contractor buses as well as School
buses. There are frequent punctures of Tires and
tubes which are not regularly maintained that have
been causing inconvenience to our students as well
as the employees of the school.
3.   The third unsatisfactory ground is that in Clause 11
of the Agreement you have ensured that the air
conditioner in all School buses and Contractor
Buses will be regularly serviced. However, no such
servicing is done to the air conditioners hence
cooling is not at all effective. The air conditions in
the buses were also found to be switched off during
the transit and since there are no windows in the
bus, the atmosphere becomes very suffocating, and
this problem has been facing by the students and
the employees since long time.
4.   The fourth unsatisfactory ground is that in Clause
16 You ensured that if any the Contractor or the
School bus goes for repair and maintenance or in
the event of any break down, you would provide
alternate bus or similar specification free of charge.
However, there were frequent breakdowns and no
such alternative means were provided by you and
the students and the employee has to travel on their
own irrespective of any weather which caused a
great hindrance.
5.   The fifth unsatisfactory ground is that in Clause 30
You have ensured that transport personnel will
adhere to official rules and regulations of the
school. However, there are many events where your
transport personnel were caught in an inebriated
condition by our transport in charge and when the
concerned person was pulled up, he was extremely
abusive to both the transport supervisor as well as
to the school transport incharge.
6.   The sixth unsatisfactory ground is that in Clause 31
You have undertaken that the transport personnel
undisciplined acts of strike, violent protest, rallies,
or otherwise dispute/interfere with the peaceful
functioning of School but there are many times
your transport personnel have conducted multiple
strikes which hampered the transportation services
and eventually hampers the peaceful functioning of
the school.
7.   The seventh unsatisfactory ground is that the
Parents have complained that students were asked
to push the buses when there was breakdown.
8.   The parents wanted to continue their pupils
education in The Millennium School but because of
poor transport services the parents have withdraw
their pupil from The Millennium Schools which is
a great loss to the school.”
34.      It is apparent from the above that the second and third ground
also fall within the exception as provided in Clause 1 of the Agreement.
As stated above, Clause 1 of the Agreement expressly enabled the
petitioner to terminate the Agreement on account of failure on the part
of the respondent to maintain the buses.
35.      Thus, the conclusion of the Arbitral Tribunal that none of the
grounds as specified under Clause 1 of the Agreement were made out
in the Termination Letter is, ex facie, erroneous. The petitioner had also
produced several e-mails as evidence that the buses were not being
maintained properly.
36.      The next question to be examined is whether the decision of the
Arbitral Tribunal that the petitioner has failed to prove deficiency of
service, is manifestly erroneous.
37.      Mr Sinha had contended that the Arbitral Tribunal had erred in
rejecting the evidence on the ground that requirements under Section
65-B of the Evidence Act were not satisfied.
38.      The Arbitral Tribunal had rejected several e-mails (RW1/3 to
RW1/63) on the ground that the requirements under Section 65-B of the
Evidence Act were not complied with. The Principal of the petitioner
school had issued the said certificate (Ex.RW1/64), in support of the
said e-mails sent from the petitioner.
39.      It is material to note that there was no objection to the certificate
under Section 65-B of the Evidence Act at the time when the same was
produced. It was also duly exhibited and marked as Ex. RW1/64.
Notwithstanding the same, the Arbitral Tribunal held that the said
certificate was inadmissible as it was defective. And, an objection to
admissibility of evidence could be taken at any stage.
40.      In R.V.E. Venkatachala Gounder v. Arulmigu Viswesaraswami
& V.P. Temple And Anr.: (2003) 8 SCC 752, the Supreme Court held
that an objection with regard to a certificate of Section 65-B of the
Evidence Act is not available if it is not taken at the material time. The
court had also explained the distinction regarding evidence that is
inherently not admissible and a defect in the manner of proving the
same. The requirement of Section 65-B of the Evidence Act relates to
the mode and manner of leading evidence and if no objection as to the
same is taken at the material time, it would not be open for a party to
raise it at a later stage. The relevant extract of the said decision is set
“20. … Ordinarily, an objection to the admissibility of
evidence should be taken when it is tendered and not
subsequently. The objections as to admissibility of
documents in evidence may be classified into two
classes : (i) an objection that the document which is
sought to be proved is itself inadmissible in evidence;
and (ii) where the objection does not dispute the
admissibility of the document in evidence but is directed
towards the mode of proof alleging the same to be
irregular or insufficient. In the first case, merely because
a document has been marked as “an exhibit”, an
objection as to its admissibility is not excluded and is
available to be raised even at a later stage or even in
appeal or revision. In the latter case, the objection
should be taken when the evidence is tendered and once
the document has been admitted in evidence and marked
as an exhibit, the objection that it should not have been
admitted in evidence or that the mode adopted for
proving the document is irregular cannot be allowed to
be raised at any stage subsequent to the marking of the
document as an exhibit. The later proposition is a rule of
fair play. The crucial test is whether an objection, if
taken at the appropriate point of time, would have
enabled the party tendering the evidence to cure the
defect and resort to such mode of proof as would be
regular. The omission to object becomes fatal because
by his failure the party entitled to object allows the party
tendering the evidence to act on an assumption that the
opposite party is not serious about the mode of proof.
On the other hand, a prompt objection does not prejudice
the party tendering the evidence, for two reasons :
firstly, it enables the court to apply its mind and
pronounce its decision on the question of admissibility
then and there; and secondly, in the event of finding of
the court on the mode of proof sought to be adopted
going against the party tendering the evidence, the
opportunity of seeking indulgence of the court for
permitting a regular mode or method of proof and
thereby removing the objection raised by the opposite
party, is available to the party leading the evidence.
Such practice and procedure is fair to both the parties.
Out of the two types of objections, referred to
hereinabove, in the latter case, failure to raise a prompt
and timely objection amounts to waiver of the necessity
for insisting on formal proof of a document, the
document itself which is sought to be proved being
admissible in evidence. In the first case, acquiescence
would be no bar to raising the objection in superior
court.”
41.      In Sonu v. State of Haryana: (2017) 8 SCC 570, the Supreme
Court referred to its earlier decisions and held as under:
“32. It is nobody's case that CDRs which are a form of
electronic record are not inherently admissible in
evidence. The objection is that they were marked before
the trial court without a certificate as required by Section
65-B(4). It is clear from the judgments referred to supra
that an objection relating to the mode or method of proof
has to be raised at the time of marking of the document
as an exhibit and not later. The crucial test, as affirmed
by this Court, is whether the defect could have been
cured at the stage of marking the document. Applying
this test to the present case, if an objection was taken to
the CDRs being marked without a certificate, the Court
could have given the prosecution an opportunity to
rectify the deficiency. It is also clear from the above
judgments that objections regarding admissibility of
documents which are per se inadmissible can be taken
even at the appellate stage. Admissibility of a document
which is inherently inadmissible is an issue which can
be taken up at the appellate stage because it is a
fundamental issue. The mode or method of proof is
procedural and objections, if not taken at the trial,
cannot be permitted at the appellate stage. If the
objections to the mode of proof are permitted to be taken
at the appellate stage by a party, the other side does not
have an opportunity of rectifying the deficiencies. The
learned Senior Counsel for the State referred to
statements under Section 161 CrPC, 1973 as an example
of documents falling under the said category of
inherently inadmissible evidence. CDRs do not fall in
the said category of documents. We are satisfied that an
objection that CDRs are unreliable due to violation of
the procedure prescribed in Section 65-B(4) cannot be
permitted to be raised at this stage as the objection
relates to the mode or method of proof.”
42.      In Om Prakash v Central Bureau of Investigation: 2017 SCC
Online Del 10249, a Coordinate Bench of this Court held as under: -
“25….Thus if a document is admissible in evidence and
no objection to the mode of proof is taken thereof at the
stage of tendering the same in trial, the party is estopped
to challenge the same before the Appellate Court or
thereafter, however if the document is per-se
inadmissible then even if marked as an exhibit the same
cannot be read in evidence.”
43.      It is also relevant to note that by virtue of Section 1 of the
Evidence Act, it does not apply to arbitration. Although, the principles
of the Evidence Act are usually applied in arbitral proceedings, sensu
stricto, the said Act is not applicable. Section 65-B of the Evidence Act
is not applicable to arbitral proceedings, yet the Arbitral Tribunal has
disregarded the entire evidence led by the petitioner regarding
deficiency of service solely on the ground that the certificate under
Section 65-B of the Evidence Act was defective.
44.      It is material to note that the receipt of several communications
relied upon, on behalf of the petitioner, were admitted. Notwithstanding
the same, the said communications were rejected as not admissible on
the ground that the certificate under Section 65-B of the Evidence Act
was not furnished. In the circumstances, the decision of the Arbitral
Tribunal to completely ignore the said e-mails, is manifestly erroneous.
45.      The Arbitral Tribunal has not addressed itself as to whether in
fact, there was any deficiency of service warranting termination of the
46.      In view of the above, the finding of the Arbitral Tribunal that the
termination of the Agreement, is illegal cannot be sustained.
47.      The Arbitral Tribunal has awarded loss of profits after 30.09.2015
solely on the basis that the termination of the Agreement was illegal and
invalid. Consequently, the award of ₹3,38,150/- per month as damages
for loss of profits for the period 03.09.2015 to 31.03.2017, is also liable
to be set aside.
48.      The next question to be examined is, whether the Arbitral
Tribunal has erred in allowing the respondent’s claim for payment for
services rendered. The Arbitral Tribunal had awarded a sum of
₹1,16,16,950/- as the amount outstanding and payable for services
rendered prior to 03.09.2015. In this regard, the Arbitral Tribunal
examined the extensive evidence produced on record and concluded that
the respondent had established its claim that the aforesaid sum remained
outstanding and payable. The respondent had produced various bills and
also details of the amounts received during the relevant quarters.
49.      Mr Sinha contended that the Arbitral Tribunal had overlooked the
evidence, which established that the parties had reconciled their
accounts as on 30.06.2015 and the respondent had confirmed that the
balance outstanding on that date was ₹32,59,414/-. He submitted that
the claims made by the respondent were inflated and exaggerated. He
referred to an e-mail dated 13.08.2014 (Ex. CW 174) and submitted that
the respondent had affirmed the said balance. The said e-mail was sent
by the respondent in response to an e-mail from the accountant of the
petitioner seeking a balance confirmation certificate till 30.06.2014. In
response, the respondent had stated that he was “OK with ledger” and
the balance amount of ₹32,59,414/- was reflected in the said e-mail. The
respondent had also asked for release of the said balance. It was
contended on behalf of the respondent that the said e-mail was for the
purposes of seeking release of the amount, which was reflected and did
not convey that the respondent had given up any of its claims.
50.      The Arbitral Tribunal had noted that the petitioner had not
produced any details or records to show the amount that was due and
paid to the respondent. On the other hand, the respondent had produced
extensive evidence, to establish the amount invoiced and received. The
Arbitral Tribunal also considered the petitioner’s contention that the
accounts were reconciled as on 30.06.2014 and had rejected the same.
First, the Arbitral Tribunal noted that neither such a plea was taken by
the petitioner in its Statement of Defence nor any record was produced
to establish the same. The Arbitral Tribunal also noted that the petitioner
was in possession of all the relevant records to ascertain the amounts
due to the respondent, but had failed to produce the same.
51.      It is seen that the Arbitral Tribunal had examined the evidence on
record produced by the parties. Given the extent of evidence produced
by the respondent, it is difficult to accept that an e-mail dated
13.08.2014 would be dispositive of the respondent’s claim. The Arbitral
Tribunal had examined the evidence brought on record and its
conclusion that the respondent had established a sum of ₹1,16,16,950/-
was due and payable by the petitioner for the services rendered prior to
03.09.2015, cannot be interfered with. The scope of examination under
Section 34 of the A&C Act does not entail re-appreciation and re-
evaluation of the evidence. The Arbitral Tribunal had examined various
bills and details of payments received to accept the respondent’s claim
for the amount due till 03.09.2015.
52.      In view of the above, the Arbitral Tribunal’s decision regarding
quantification of the amounts due to the respondent is not amenable to
challenge on the grounds as set out under Section 34 of the A&C Act.
53.      It was contended on behalf of the petitioner that the Arbitral
Tribunal erred in awarding a sum of ₹65,13,755/- towards charges for
extra cabs hired. Mr Sinha had pointed out that in compliance of the
order dated 12.12.2019 passed by the Arbitral Tribunal, the respondent
submitted a breakup of the amounts claimed as Contractor’s fee and
‘extra cab charges’ by an e-mail dated 20.12.2019. A perusal of the said
e-mail indicates that the respondent had reduced its claim to
₹53,13,755/- as it acknowledged the receipt of a sum of ₹12 lakhs. The
tabular statement sent by the respondent to the Arbitral Tribunal in
compliance with the order dated 12.12.2019, is reproduced below: -
“Quarter-Wise Detail of Amounts claimed towards Cab Hire Charges
Quarter          Amount Claimed in Quarter      Amount Received in
July 14 to Sept. 14             5,92,916            12,00,000 (inclusive of
Total Amount Claimed towards Cab Hire Charges          Rs. 65,13,755
Total Amount Received towards Cab Hire Charges         Rs. 12,00,000
Total Amount Outstanding towards Cab Hire Charges     Rs. 53,13,755”
54.      The above statement clearly indicates that the respondent had
reduced its claim for the amount outstanding towards cab hire charges
to ₹53,13,755/-. The learned counsel appearing for the respondent has
not disputed the said e-mail.
55.      In view of the above, the impugned award to the extent it awards
an amount in excess of ₹53,13,755/- as cab hire charges, is liable to set
aside.
56.      The petitioner has also impeached the impugned award in regard
to the interest awarded by the Arbitral Tribunal. It is pointed out that the
Arbitral Tribunal has awarded pre-award interest at the rate of 18% per
annum on the amount due to the petitioner from the date when the
amount became due to the date of filing the Statement of Claims.
57.      The petitioner’s challenge to award of interest is two pronged.
First, it is contended that the rate of interest awarded, that is,18% per
annum, is excessive and manifestly erroneous. Second, it is contended
that Arbitral Tribunal erred in awarding pendente lite interest on the pre-
award interest.
58.      Insofar as the award of interest is concerned, it is now well settled
that the Arbitral Tribunal has wide discretion in awarding interest and
this Court is unable to accept that the award of interest at the rate of 18%
is manifestly erroneous and warrants any interference in these
proceedings. [See: Punjab State Civil Supplies Corporation Limited
(PUNSUP) and Anr. v Ganpati Rice Mills: SLP (C) 36655 of 2016,
59.      In view of the above, the impugned award to the extent it allows
the respondent’s claim for loss of profits and cab charges to the extent
of ₹12 lakhs, is set aside.
60.      The petition is, accordingly, disposed of in the aforesaid terms.
