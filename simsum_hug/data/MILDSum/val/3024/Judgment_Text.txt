Mr. Himanshu Takke, AGP, for the State on Notice.
1.      This application filed under Section 11 of the Arbitration and
Conciliation Act, 1996, seeks appointment of a Sole Arbitrator to adjudicate
upon disputes that have arisen under a Memorandum of Understanding
(MOU) dated 29th August, 2009. The application filed in 2016 remains
pending for numerous reasons.      Initially, the parties were referred to
mediation since they were in negotiations and meetings have been held prior
to 2017. These meetings did not yield results and on 18th April, 2019 the
respondents raised objections to the maintainability of the petition since the
MOU was not sufficiently stamped. This is found to be recorded in an
order dated 18th April, 2019. Eventually mediation having failed, the
matter was taken up for hearing on 26 th November, 2019. After noting
that clause 17 of the MOU contained an arbitration clause, the court
noted that stamp duty in respect of the MOU was payable by the
2.       In view of the objections to stamping, the court in its order dated
26th November, 2019 considered the nature of the MOU and observed
that unless stamp duty is fully paid with penalty, the court could not
proceed with appointing an arbitrator, in view of the decisions of the
Supreme Court in Garware Wall Ropes Limited v/s. Coastal Marine
Constructions & Engineering Ltd.1 and SMS Tea Estates Private Limited
v/s. Chandmari Tea Company Private Limited(P). 2          The court did not
venture to consider the nature of the document and recorded a
statement on behalf of the applicants Advocates that they would submit
the document of the Collector of Stamps along with a copy of the order
so as to enable the Collector to adjudicate the correct duty payable. The
matter was thereafter adjourned with a request to the Collector to
decide the matter at his earliest convenience preferably before 24 th
January, 2019. The matter has remained pending since then. On 25 th
February, 2020 time was taken for parties to attempt a settlement.
3.      On 3rd January, 2022 when the matter was listed before this court,
a statement was made that no settlement had been arrived at. The
matter therefore came to be listed for dismissal on 10 th January, 2022,
counsel informed the court that pursuant to the order of 26 th November,
2019 the Collector had heard the applicants. The original instrument
had been presented to the Collector and it was only now awaiting
adjudication on the quantum of duty payable.         The Collector was
directed then to do so within one week.
4.      On 17th January, 2022 the court was informed that the Collector
had scheduled the matter on 20 th January, 2022.        Accordingly, the
matter was listed on 20th January, 2022. No progress having been made,
the matter was taken up for hearing and has been since heard. The
learned Government Pleader who was present in court on the last
occasion has appeared on notice and he informed the court that the
Collector was expected to pass orders on 21st February, 2022.
5.      Mr. Kadam submits that notwithstanding the fact that the
Collector of Stamps is yet to pass an order on the adjudication
application, the appointment of the arbitrator need not be delayed. He
relies upon the verdict of the Supreme Court in Intercontinental Hotels
Group (India) Pvt. Ltd. and Anr. v/s. Waterline Hotels Pvt. Ltd. 3 holding
that insufficiency of stamps is not a reason for refusing to appoint an
arbitrator. Mr. Kadam submits that unlike an unstamped document
which was the subject matter of numerous decisions of the Supreme
Court including that of Vidya Drolia and Ors. vs. Durga Trading
Corporation4, on a fair reading of the decision of the Supreme Court in
N.N. Global Mercantile Private Limited v/s. Indo Unique Flame Limited
and Ors.5 and Intercontinental Hotels (supra), it is now clear that an
arbitrator can be appointed in these circumstances. In this respect he
draws support from S. N. Prasad, Hitek Industries (Bihar) Limited v/s.
Monnet Finance Ltd. and Ors. 6 and Unissi (India) Private Limited v/s.
Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research7. Mr. Kadam
has invited my attention to paragraphs 10, 12 and 17 in S.N. Prasad
(supra),      paragraphs 18 and 23     of Intercontinental Hotel Group
(supra), paragraphs 54 and 55 of N.N. Global Mercantile (supra) and
paragraph 13 of Unissi (supra) and canvassed the applicants’ case on
the basis that the appointment of an arbitrator need not be now held up.
6.        Prima facie, it appeared that on the issue of admissibility of a
document due to insufficient stamping, the decision in Intercontinental
Hotels Group(supra) would be a way out of the impasse presented by
the decisions in SMS Tea Estates Private Limited vs. Chandmari Tea
Company Private Ltd8, Garware Wall Ropes (supra) and Vidya Drolia
(supra) all of which hold that it would be necessary to await the actual
stamping of document with adjudicated value. As against this, the
decision in N. N. Global (supra) suggests that once the existence of an
arbitration agreement is admitted, there would be no impediment in
appointing an arbitrator.
7.      However, Mr. Madon on behalf of the respondent has serious
reservations on this aspect. He submits that the decision in
Intercontinental Hotels (supra) would not come to the assistance of the
applicant.        He has sought to distinguish it on facts.  Mr. Madon
submitted that the factual aspects in Intercontinental (supra) will reveal
that the court had come to the conclusion that issues as to whether the
respondent is estopped from raising the contention of unenforceability
of the agreement or the issue whether the agreement was insufficiently
or incorrectly stamped, can be decided finally at a later stage. Mr.
Madon has drawn my attention to the fact that the petitioners in
Intercontinental (supra) had contended that they had paid the required
stamp duty including the penalty and had sought appointment of an
arbitrator pursuant to payment of such duty.
8.      In other words, the petitioner had self assessed the duty payable
and paid the duty and penalty on the document thereby presenting a
case of insufficiency of stamps being cured by self-assessment. This was
contested by the respondent in that case on the basis that the document
had been wrongly classified for the purposes of stamp duty and stamp
duty had been paid under Article 5(j) of the Schedule of the Karnataka
Stamp Act, 1957 which was erroneous.           Therefore, the respondent
contended that the agreement was not properly stamped. It is in this
factual background that Intercontinental Hotels (supra) had permitted
the appointment of the arbitrator.
9.      In the present case, Mr. Madon points out that the applicants are
unwilling to pay duty as may be assessed. As on date, there is no
commitment to pay the duty upon adjudication since Mr. Kadam has
reserved his right to avail of a statutory appeal. Mr. Madon therefore
submits that the applicants cannot take advantage of the decision in
Intercontinental Hotels (supra) since there has been no self-assessment
of duty and penalty. Mr. Kadam had also raised the contention that
assuming the agreement is insufficiently stamped, the court could still
appoint an arbitrator since Section 7(4)(c) contemplates an arbitration
agreement culled out of statements of claims and defence can be
identified and acted upon. In the present case prior to the filing of the
application        the respondents did refer to the arbitration agreement
between the parties and that is not being disputed by the respondents.
He therefore sought to take advantage of the fact that the Act itself
provides for an arbitration agreement to be culled out for
correspondence and pleadings in the present case.
10.     Having heard the learned counsel for the parties and having
perused the pleadings and the contentions, one thing is clear that
incorporation of an arbitration agreement within the MOU is admitted.
I have observed that clause 15 of the MOU requires stamp duty and
registration charges in respect of the agreement to be paid by the
purchasers viz. the applicants whereas a sum of only Rs.100/- has been
paid on the instrument as of now. If I come to the conclusion that
insufficient stamping would render the application incompetent, we
would have to await payment of duty as assessed and subject to all
challenges that the parties may avail of. If I conclude that payment of
Rs.100/- would be sufficient to avail of the decision in Intercontinental
Hotels (supra), it may be possible to rule in favour of the applicants.
12.     I am of the view that it is not necessary to delve deep into the
nature of the agreement between the parties. Suffice it to say that it
relates to construction and purchase of a high end luxury villa from the
respondents. What is of relevance is the nature of the document, the
stamp duty if any, already paid and duty if any, that is yet to be paid.
There is no doubt that the MOU in clause 10 contemplates execution
and registration of a formal agreement for sale and an indenture of
conveyance and that is a matter that has engaged the attention of this
court in a series of matters. In the instant case, the order dated 26 th
November, 2019 has already observed that the court does not intend to
examine those aspects.
13.     Mr. Kadam had placed reliance on the existence of a arbitration
agreement dehors the clause in MOU viz. by the assertion in the
pleading and the non-denial by the respondent. In S.N. Prasad (supra) a
non-signatory guarantor was sought to be proceeded against pursuant
to an arbitration clause. In paragraph 11, the Supreme Court observed
that an arbitration agreement in writing can be said to exist if it is
contained in exchange of statements of claim and defence in which the
existence of the arbitration agreement is alleged by one party and is not
denied by the other. In that case, the statement of claim filed before the
arbitrator did not contain any assertion that an arbitration agreement
existed between the non-signatory to the agreement and the appellant
who had not denied the fact that there was no arbitration agreement
between him and the non-signatory. In that view of the matter, the
court found that there was no arbitration agreement between them and
therefore the arbitrator did not have jurisdiction. The Supreme Court
also observed that the expression “statements of claim and defence”
referred to in Section 7(4)(c) is not restricted to the statements of claim
and defence filed before an arbitral tribunal. On the other hand, if there
is an assertion of existence of an arbitration agreement in any suit,
petition or application filed before any court and if there is no denial of
the same in a defence or counter statements filed by the other party, the
exchange of statements of claim and denial for the purposes of 7(4)(c)
would be complied with. Therefore in an application under Section 11
of the Act, if an applicant has asserted the existence of an arbitration
agreement which the respondent does not deny in the defence, the
court can proceed on the basis that there is an arbitration agreement in
writing between the parties.
14.       In my view, the clause itself is the genesis of the application and
an instrument containing the said clause has now been found to be
inadmissible in evidence for want of sufficient stamp duty. The question
is whether at this stage one should prevent a party from seeking an
appointment of a arbitrator under Section 11 and hold up the entire
pre-reference proceeding or whether the party should be pushed
beyond that hurdle and leave it to the arbitral tribunal to consider the
admissibility of the documents subject to paying payment of stamp duty.
If this court finds that the document is admissible for the purposes of
Section 11 and that the court cannot look into the existence of such an
agreement to refer disputes to arbitration, we have a road block which
can be cleared only after duty is paid. If not, it may be possible for this
court to appoint the tribunal and the arbitrator would entered the
reference and thereafter be faced with a situation where the document
remains unstamped. In that set of facts, there is the possibility of time
for the arbitral tribunal to complete the reference and make an award
running out and extension(s) of time would have to be sought.
15.       In my view, that would be one of the ways that the court
approaches the issues involved, viz is to consider the practicality of
appointing an arbitrator and have the reference proceed adjudication
while the applicants decide whether or not to pay duty as assessed. The
other option is to await a final decision on the issue of stamping and
once that is concluded, the parties can be relegated to arbitration by
appointing an arbitrator.      In this background, it is appropriate to
consider the decision in N.N. Global (supra) which in paragraph 54 in
“In the present case, since both parties have admitted the
existence of the arbitration agreement between the parties, as
recorded in the judgment of the High Court, and even before
this Court during oral submissions, parties may either appoint a
sole arbitrator consensually; failing which, an application
under Section 11 for appointment of the arbitrator may be
16.    The Supreme Court then proceeded to set aside the judgment of
the Bombay High Court and directed the Secretary General of the
Supreme Court to impound the instrument and forward it to the
Collector of Stamps for assessment of stamp duty. On determination of
stamp duty, the appellant-plaintiff was directed to make payment of
the duty assessed within four weeks subject to the right of statutory
appeal available to the appellant. N. N. Global (supra) also held that
the view taken by the Supreme Court in SMS Tea Estates (supra) and
Garware Wall Ropes(supra) that non-payment of stamp duty would
render the arbitration agreement non-existent, is not the correct
position in law but also finds that Vidya Drolia (supra) had affirmed
the judgment in Garware Wall Ropes (supra) and the court hence made
a reference to a larger bench.
17.    In the present case, the MOU is executed on stamp paper of
Rs.100/-. Thus, there is no question of the document being
“unstamped”. It is at best insufficiently stamped and if a document is
insufficiently stamped, then we have to consider the effect of the
Supreme Court’s decision in Intercontinental Hotels (supra) which
takes into consideration the decision in Garware Wall Ropes, N.N.
Global, Vidya Drolia, SMS Tea Estate (supra) and then concludes that
while there is a need to constitute a larger bench to settle the
jurisprudence taking cognizance of the time sensitivity of the matter,
when dealing with arbitration issues, all matters which are still at pre-
appointment stage, cannot be left hanging till the larger bench settles
the issue and accordingly the court should ensure that until the larger
bench decides on the interplay between Sections 11(6) and 16, that
arbitrations are carried on, unless the issue before the court “patently
indicates existence of deadwood”.
18.    The deadwood concept has been dealt with extensively in Vidya
Drolia (supra). Applying that test in Intercontinental Hotel Group
(supra) the Supreme Court has made reference to the same in
“Usually   issues of arbitrability/validity are matters to be
adjudicated upon by arbitrators. The only narrow exception
carved out was that Courts could adjudicate to ‘cut the
deadwood’.”
Ultimately the court held that the watch word for the courts is
‘when in doubt, do refer’.
20.     In paragraph 23, the court observed that;
“while there is need to constitute a larger bench to settle the
jurisprudence, although the court was cognizant of time-
sensitivity when dealing with arbitration issues.     All these
matters are still at a pre-appointment stage, and court cannot
leave them hanging until the larger Bench settles the issue. In
view of the same, this court-until the larger Bench decides on
the interplay between Section 11(6) and 16 – should ensure
that arbitrations are carried on, unless the issue before the
court patently indicates existence of deadwood.”
21.     Thus, unless the court comes to the conclusion that there is
existence of deadwood, that the appointment procedure should be
completed. In paragraph 24, the court observed thus;
“24. This brings us to the only issue at hand : whether the
issue of insufficient stamping raised by the respondent   is
deadwood and clearly indicative of an unworkable
arbitration agreement, or there are deeper issues which can
be resolved at a later stage.”
22.     In the instant case, the agreement in the form of MOU which
contemplates execution of a formal agreement for sale and/or
conveyance and registered the same. This agreement proposed to be
executed would certainly attract stamp duty but such an instrument is
yet to be executed. Thus, the question is whether duty can be paid on a
later stage and that is something that will have to be gone into at the
appropriate stage and not       in this application which restricted to
appointment of an Arbitrator.
23.       In the present case, I am not able to find any element of
deadwood and hence, I have considered Mr. Madon’s objection to
acceptance of the decision in Intercontinental Hotels (supra) and his
attempt to distinguish the same on facts from this case such that the
tribunal is not appointed merely on the basis of insufficient stamping for
an issue to be decided later. There is merit in Mr. Madon’s contention
that on facts the Supreme Court was considering a situation where the
appellant before it had self assessed duty payable, penalty payable and
had paid the same. The challenge then remaining was the respondents
contention of wrong classification and hence improper duty being paid,
thus, leading to insufficient duty being paid but I am of the view that
the larger issue before the court is whether the arbitration should be
held up at the pre-appointment stage and pre-reference stage or
whether party should be left to follow the procedures post reference and
be left to agitate    their respective challenges.     The aspect of     self-
assessment of duty and penalty and payment thereof was not the issued
that fueled the ratio. The ratio is clear viz. least interference at the pre-
appointment stage.
24.      I am of the view that the ratio in Intercontinental Hotel Group
(supra) would apply squarely to the facts of this case as well. Although
it is the case of Mr. Madon that the fact in Intercontinental Hotel Group
(supra) being different inasmuch as stamp duty had already been paid
whereas in the instant case it has not been paid, that is not the ratio of
the case but an aspect that the court need not consider in the facts of
this case especially in view of the provisions under Section 11(6A) of
the Arbitration and Conciliation Act which requires the court to confine
itself to the existence of the agreement. The deletion of this Section
11(6A) by the 2019 amendment I am told is yet to be notified.
24.        The existence of the agreement not being in dispute, I do not
think it necessary to consider Mr. Kadam’s alternative argument as to
ascertaining of existence of the arbitration agreement culled out of
correspondence. In my view, it would not be appropriate to consider
the     arbitration   agreement     as   having  been    incorporated   in
correspondence between the parties since the correspondence in turn
refers to clause 17. In the present case I have observed that pursuant to
invocation of arbitration agreement the applicants have also nominated
a Sole Arbitrator on 8th January, 2016. In conclusion, I am of the view
that the application is liable to be allowed.
24.     For all the aforesaid reasons, I pass the following order;
(i)      Mr. Karl Tamboly, Advocate, is appointed as Sole Arbitrator to
adjudicate upon claims and counter claims, if any,
(ii)     The learned Arbitrator is requested to file his disclosure
statement under Section 11(8) and Section 12(1) within two
weeks with the Prothonotary and Senior Maser and provide
copies to the parties.
(iii)    Parties to appear before the Sole Arbitrator on a date to be fixed
by him at his earliest convenience.
(iv)     Fees payable to the Sole Arbitrator will be in accordance with the
Bombay High Court (Fee Payable to Arbitrators) Rules, 2018.
(v)      Arbitration Application is disposed in the above terms.
(vi)     No costs.
