This Criminal Petition under Section 482 of the Code of
Criminal Procedure, 1973 (for short “Cr.P.C.”) is filed seeking
quash of F.I.R in Crime No.330 of 2021 of Devanakonda Police
Heard learned counsel for the petitioners and learned
Additional Public Prosecutor for the State.
The petitioners are A-1, A-3 and A-4 in Crime No.330 of
2021 of Devanakonda Police Station, Kurnool District. On a report
lodged by the 2nd respondent, who is the de facto complainant, that
the petitioners have attacked him and beat him and also outraged
the modesty of his wife, a case in the above crime for the offences
punishable under Sections 341, 323, 324, 354, 506 r/w 34 IPC
was registered against the petitioners. The said case is now under
Learned counsel for the petitioners would submit that the
petitioners have lodged a report with police against the 2nd
respondent and as the same was not registered as an F.I.R that
they approached the Superintendent of Police and on his
directions,   the  F.I.R  was   registered   against   the de   facto
complainant and that thereafter the de facto complainant lodged
the present report with a delay of 30 days and as such the
allegations ascribed against the petitioners are all false and that
the petitioners are falsely implicated in this case. Learned counsel
for the petitioners sought for quash of the F.I.R on the aforesaid
Learned Additional Public Prosecutor opposed the Criminal
Petition. He would submit that there are clear allegations in the
F.I.R regarding the way in which the petitioners have beat the de
facto complainant and outraged the modesty of his wife and as
such the matter requires investigation to find out the truth or
otherwise of the said allegations. So, he would pray for dismissal of
As can be seen from the contents of the F.I.R, there are clear
allegations that the petitioners have beat the de facto complainant
and also his wife and a clear allegation of outraging the modesty of
wife of the de facto complainant was also made. These allegations
prima facie constitute offences punishable under Sections 341,
323, 324, 354, 506 r/w 34 IPC for which the F.I.R was registered.
Therefore, the matter requires investigation to find out the truth or
otherwise of the said allegations. The mere fact that after the case
was registered against the petitioners on the report lodged by the
de facto complainant that the present report was lodged against
them as a counter blast by itself cannot be a ground to quash the
F.I.R. Whether the allegations are false or not and whether the
report was lodged as a counter blast to the report lodged by the de
facto complainant or not is the matter to be ascertained by the
Investigating Officer during the course of investigation. Therefore,
there are no valid legal grounds emanating from the record
warranting interference of this Court under Section 482 Cr.P.C to
quash the F.I.R at this stage.
Resultantly, the Criminal Petition is dismissed.
Miscellaneous petitions, if any pending, in the Criminal
Petition, shall stand closed.
