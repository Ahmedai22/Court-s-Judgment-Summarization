The petitioner filed this petition under Article 226 of the Constitution
of India has approached this Court while praying for the following reliefs:
“i.     To hold that the proceeding initiated under Section 67 of the
ii.     To quash authorization letter dated 21/01/2022 issued by
respondent No.2 (Annexure P/4);
iii     To quash the impugned order dated 27/01/2022 (Annexure
P/11) passed by the respondent No.5.
iv      To direct the respondent department to conduct stock
verification as per law, without being influenced by stock verification
report dated 25/01/2022.
v       Hon’ble Court may kindly be pleased to pass any order
writ/order which this Hon’ble Court deem fit and proper in the fact
and circumstance of the case”.
2.       The facts reveal that the premises of the petitioner was searched at
the instance of the revenue in exercise of powers conferred under Section 67
of the M.P. GST Act, 2017 and thereafter the petitioner since had certain
grievances as regards the manner of search, made an application before
respondent No.4 and prayed that stock of coal lying in the premises be
measured and checked again as earlier on 25/01/2022, the team which
carried out the search did not seize any material and left the premises.
3.     Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that the impugned order is
being assailed inasmuch as the search was not carried out in accordance with
the provisions of Section 67 of the M.P. GST Act, 2017 inasmuch as to carry
out the search under the provisions of Goods and Service Tax Act, the
procedure as laid down in Code of Criminal Procedure 1973, is applicable
which inter alia stipulates the search is required to be carried out in the
presence of two witnesses but in the present case, no independent witnesses
were present and respondent did not seize any material from the premises of
the petitioner, therefore, it was obligatory on the part of the Revenue to re-
measure the stock of coal lying in the premises.
3.     Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that the authority should
have reasons to believe that search is required while issuing authorization
for inspection/search under Section 67 the M.P. GST Act, 2017 and in the
present case there was no satisfaction arrived at by the Commissioner State
Tax, while authorizing the Assistant Commissioner of Sales Tax to carry out
the search. Thus, learned counsel for the petitioner submits that the authority
should have recorded the reasons which necessitated the search in the
premises of the present case. Thus assail is to the order of authorization dated
21/01/2022 as well as the order dated 27/01/2022 by which the application of
petitioner has been turned down by respondent No.5 to re-measure the stock
of coal.
4.     Per contra, learned counsel for respondents opposes the application
and submits that the entire procedure was carried out in accordance with law
and the search was carried out in the presence of independent witness. Even
the nephew of petitioner namely Arihant Jain was also available at the time
of search and signed the Panchnama, therefore the petitioner cannot allege
that the search was carried out in violation of statutory provisions.
5.     Learned counsel for the respondent also submits that there are two
independent witnesses namely Anil Dahiya and Arvind Patel signed
panchnama and submits that the search was carried out strictly in accordance
with law in the presence of representative of the petitioner and none of the
representatives who were available at the time of search, raised any kind of
objection as regards manner in which the search was carried out.
5.1     Learned counsel further submits that it is not the case of Revenue that
any material has been seized. On the contrary, during course of search the
liability was admitted by the petitioner itself and therefore, the action to
challenge the process at this stage, is grossly misconceived, thus has prayed
that the petition deserve to be dismissed.
6.      We have considered the rival contentions and submissions so putforth
before us so also perused the record.
7.      The crux of the matter lies in a document in the present case I.e. the
Panchnama which has been produced on record by the petitioner itself. The
same reveals that on 25/01/2022 a search team reached the premises of the
petitioner and at the premises there were two persons namely Anil Kumar
Dahiya and Arvind Patel including nephew of proprietor of the petitioner’s
firm Arihant Jain were available and signatures of all these persons were
obtained while carrying out the Panchanama and then the stocks were
checked there only. It was found that there was discrepancies in the stock
which attracted the levy of tax, hence, the petitioner out of his own free will
deposited the amount of tax as well as penalty of Rs.38,46,195/-. Relevant
extract of panchnama is quoted below:
“ >qdsgh ,oa eSgj xksnke ij fLFkr HkkSfrd LVkWd dks lwfpc) o ewY;kadu fd;s tkus ds

8.       Thus, if the said Panchanama is perused, it is evident that on the date
of search itself, the amount of tax and a penalty was deposited by the
petitioner as discrepancies were found in the stock and thus there was no
question of any kind of seizure. Moreover, there were independent witnesses
as well as the petitioner own representatives who did not raise any objection
as regards search, thus, filing of the application before respondent No.5 to re-
measure the stock was an afterthought. Moreover, it is beyond
comprehension, that once the search team, after search left the premises on
25/01/2022, the stock of coal would have remained untouched and not
alienated during the subsequent period.
9.       Thus, in our considered view, there is no infirmity as far as the
order/letter impugned are concerned and accordingly the present petition
being devoid of merits stands dismissed.
