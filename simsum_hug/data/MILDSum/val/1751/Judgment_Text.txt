The lis involved in these cases is connected to each other.
Therefore, they were heard together and are being disposed of with
the following common order.
2. Crl.P.No. 3786 of 2022 is filed seeking to quash the order
dated 08.04.2022 passed in Crl.M.P. (Sr). No. 3550 of 2022 in File
No. ECIR/HYZO/14/2021 by the Metropolitan Sessions Judge –
cum – Special Court Under PMLA Act, 2002 at Hyderabad.
Likewise, Crl.P.No. 4127 of 2022 and Crl.P.No. 4137 of 2022 are
filed to quash the orders dated 13.04.2022 and 31.03.2022 in File
No. ECIR/HYZO/14/2021 respectively. The petitioner is A.1 in the
said crime.
3. Heard Mr. T. Niranjan Reddy learned Senior Counsel
representing Mr. Avinash Desai learned counsel for the Petitioner
and Mr. Anil Prasad Tiwari, learned Spl. Public Prosecutor for
Directorate of Enforcement for the Respondent.
4. The Petitioner is the Chairman and Managing Director of
Respondent authority had registered ECIR/HYZO/14/2021 for the
offence of money laundering under the Prevention of Money
Laundering Act, 2002 (hereinafter ‘PMLA’) against KSBL. The
allegations against KSBL and the Petitioner include diversion of
large-scale clients funds through shell companies which resulted in
huge losses to the investors. It is further alleged that the clients’
money was misused by the shell companies created by KSBL and
the said money was transferred to the Petitioner and his family
5. Various FIRs were registered against the Petitioner and he
was arrested on 19.08.2021 in relation to Crime No. 100 of 2021
which is pending on the file of P.S. Central Crime Station
Hyderabad. The Petitioner in the said crime was remanded to
judicial custody. Pursuant to a P.T. warrant dated 10.01.2021, the
Petitioner was produced before the Metropolitan Sessions Judge –
cum – Special Court (hereinafter ‘Designated Court’) on
20.01.2021. On the same day, the Petitioner was remanded to
judicial custody.
6. The Petitioner has been in jail since 20.01.2022.
According to the Petitioner, the offences alleged against him are
not punishable for a term not less than ten years, death, life
imprisonment. Therefore, he is entitled for statutory bail under
Section 167(2) of the Cr.P.C. as the investigation is not completed
within sixty (60) days of his remand.
7. According to the Petitioner, the period of sixty days
expired on 21.03.2022. Therefore, on 21.03.2022, he filed an
application seeking default bail under Section 167 (2) of the
Cr.P.C. citing expiry of sixty days. The said application was
returned as infructuous on the ground that a charge sheet/complaint
was filed by the Respondent herein on 19.03.2022 which was
before the expiry of sixty days.
8. However, subsequently on 31.03.2022 another application
under Section 167 was filed by the Respondent herein seeking
extension of remand. According to the Petitioner, the application
was filed seeking further custody of the Petitioner to complete the
investigation. The said application was allowed and the custody of
the Petitioner was extended till 13.04.2022.
9. The Petitioner relying on the application dated 31.03.2022
filed by the Respondent which stated that investigation is yet to be
completed, filed another default bail application dated 01.04.2022
under Section 167(2) of the Cr.P.C. In the said bail application, the
Petitioner contended that no complaint/charge sheet was filed in
terms of Section 173(2) of the Cr.P.C. as investigation is yet to be
completed. The said bail application was returned as infructuous on
08.04.2022. The said order also stated that the application dated
31.03.2022 seeking extension of remand was returned as charge
sheet was already filed on 19.03.2022.
10. Subsequently, another application dated 13.04.2022
under Section 167 of the Cr.P.C. was filed by the Respondent
herein seeking extension of remand. The said application was
allowed and the remand was extended till 27.04.2022.
11. The Petitioner in the present criminal petitions has
challenged the order dated 31.03.2022 in ECIR/HYZO/14/2021, in
Crl.P.No.    4137    of    2022,    order   dated    13.04.2022    in
ECIR/HYZO/14/2021, in Crl.P.No. 4127 of 2022 and order dated
08.04.2022       in    Crl.M.P.(sr)      No.3350     of    2022      in
ECIR/HYZO/14/2021, in Crl.P.No. 3786 of 2022, inter alia, on the
ground that he is entitled for statutory bail under Section 167(2) of
i.       A complaint in the nature of interim report was filed on
19.03.2022. No complaint/charge sheet in terms of
Section 173(2) of the Cr.P.C. is filed as the investigation
admittedly is not completed. Therefore, in the absence of
completion of investigation, the Petitioner is entitled for
statutory bail under Section 167(2) of the Cr.P.C. after a
period of sixty days which accrued on 21.03.2022.
ii.     The complaint dated 19.03.2022 was filed only to deny
statutory bail to the Petitioner.
iii.    The object of Section 167(2) of the Cr.P.C. is to complete
the investigation within the prescribed time. Failure of the
prosecution to complete investigation and file charge
sheet within prescribed time will give the accused a right
of statutory bail. Reliance was placed on M. Ravindran
v. Intelligence Officer, Directorate of Revenue
iv.     The Designated Court has no power to return the bail
application filed under Section 167(2) of the Cr.P.C.
Reliance was placed on Directorate of Enforcement v.
v.      The Petitioner was not produced before the Designated
Court when the remand was extended.
i.      A     complaint/charge           sheet      was      already     filed     on
19.03.2022. Therefore, statutory bail under Section
167(2) of the Cr.P.C cannot be claimed once the charge
sheet is filed. Reliance was placed on Serious Fraud
Investigation Office v. Rahul Modi3.
ii.     Remand was extended under Section 309 of the Cr.P.C.
and the Respondent can seek custody of the Petitioner to
complete further investigation under Section 44(2) of the
Order dated 15.02.2022 passed in Criminal Petition Nos. 9825, 9846 and 10021 of 2021.
iii.     The Petitioner is trying to claim statutory bail to
overcome the requirement of bail under Section 45 of the
iv.     The Petitioner did not oppose remand which was extended
under Section 309 of the Cr.P.C. Reliance was placed
Sunil Kumar Sharma v. State4.
14. In the present case, the issue before the Court is whether
the Petitioner is entitled for statutory bail under Section 167(2) of
the Cr.P.C. For the sake of convenience, the chronology of dates is
20.01.2022             Petitioner was remanded to judicial custody
and has been in jail since then.

Before deciding the issue at hand, it is apposite to discuss the
object and scope of Section 167(2) of the Cr.P.C.
(2) The Magistrate to whom an accused person is forwarded under this
section may, whether he has or has not jurisdiction to try the case, from
time to time, authorise the detention of the accused in such custody as
such Magistrate thinks fit, for a term not exceeding fifteen days in the
whole; and if he has no jurisdiction to try the case or commit it for trial,
and considers further detention unnecessary, he may order the accused to
be forwarded to a Magistrate having such jurisdiction:
(a) the Magistrate may authorise the detention of the accused person,
otherwise than in the custody of the police, beyond the period of fifteen
days; if he is satisfied that adequate grounds exist for doing so, but no
Magistrate shall authorise the detention of the accused person in custody
under this paragraph for a total period exceeding,-
(i) ninety days, where the investigation relates to an offence punishable
with death, imprisonment for life or imprisonment for a term of not less
(ii) sixty days, where the investigation relates to any other offence, and,
on the expiry of the said period of ninety days, or sixty days, as the case
may be, the accused person shall be released on bail if he is prepared to
and does furnish bail, and every person released on bail under this sub-
section shall be deemed to be so released under the provisions of
Chapter XXXIII for the purposes of that Chapter.
(b) no Magistrate shall authorise detention in any custody under this
section unless the accused is produced before him;
(c) no Magistrate of the second class, not specially empowered in this
behalf by the High Court, shall authorise detention in the custody of the
police.
15. Section 167(2) of the Cr.P.C. obligates the investigative
agencies to complete the investigation in a time bound manner. The
object behind incorporating a time limit to complete investigation
was explained by a full bench of the Supreme Court inRavindran
(Supra). The relevant paragraphs are extracted below:
17. Before we proceed to expand upon the parameters of
the right to default bail under Section 167(2) as interpreted by
various decisions of this Court, we find it pertinent to note the
observations made by this Court in Uday Mohanlal
Acharya [Uday Mohanlal Acharya v. State of Maharashtra,
(2001) 5 SCC 453 : 2001 SCC (Cri) 760] on the fundamental
right to personal liberty of the person and the effect of
deprivation of the same as follows: (SCC p. 472, para 13)
“13. … Personal liberty is one of the cherished objects of
the Indian Constitution and deprivation of the same can only be
in accordance with law and in conformity with the provisions
thereof, as stipulated under Article 21 of the Constitution.
When the law provides that the Magistrate could authorise the
detention of the accused in custody up to a maximum period as
indicated in the proviso to sub-section (2) of Section 167, any
further detention beyond the period without filing of a challan
by the investigating agency would be a subterfuge and would
not be in accordance with law and in conformity with the
provisions of the Criminal Procedure Code, and as such, could
be violative of Article 21 of the Constitution.”
17.1. Article 21 of the Constitution of India provides that
“no person shall be deprived of his life or personal liberty
except according to procedure established by law”. It has been
settled by a Constitution Bench of this Court in Maneka
Gandhi v. Union of India [Maneka Gandhi v. Union of India,
(1978) 1 SCC 248] , that such a procedure cannot be arbitrary,
unfair or unreasonable. The history of the enactment of Section
167(2) CrPC and the safeguard of “default bail” contained in
the proviso thereto is intrinsically linked to Article 21 and is
nothing but a legislative exposition of the constitutional
safeguard that no person shall be detained except in accordance
with rule of law.
17.2. Under Section 167 of the Code of Criminal Procedure,
1898 (“the 1898 Code”) which was in force prior to the
enactment of the CrPC, the maximum period for which an
accused could be remanded to custody, either police or judicial,
was 15 days. However, since it was often unworkable to
conclude complicated investigations within 15 days, a practice
arose wherein investigating officers would file “preliminary
charge-sheets” after the expiry of the remand period. The State
would then request the Magistrate to postpone commencement
of the trial and authorise further remand of the accused under
Section 344 of the 1898 Code till the time the investigation was
completed and the final charge-sheet was filed. The Law
Commission of India in Report No. 14 on Reforms of the
Judicial Administration (Vol. II, 1948, pp. 758-760) pointed
out that in many cases the accused were languishing for several
months in custody without any final report being filed before
the courts. It was also pointed out that there was conflict in
judicial opinion as to whether the Magistrate was bound to
release the accused if the police report was not filed within 15
17.3. Hence the Law Commission in Report No. 14
recommended the need for an appropriate provision specifically
providing for continued remand after the expiry of 15 days, in a
manner that “while meeting the needs of a full and proper
investigation in cases of serious crime, will still safeguard the
liberty of the person of the individual”. Further, that the
legislature should prescribe a maximum time period beyond
which no accused could be detained without filing of the police
report before the Magistrate. It was pointed out that in England,
even a person accused of grave offences such as treason could
not be indefinitely detained in prison till commencement of the
17.4. The suggestion made in Report No. 14 was
reiterated by the Law Commission in Report No. 41 on The
Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898 (Vol. I, 1969, pp. 76-77).
The Law Commission re-emphasised the need to guard
against the misuse of Section 344 of the 1898 Code by filing
“preliminary reports” for remanding the accused beyond
the statutory period prescribed under Section 167. It was
pointed out that this could lead to serious abuse wherein
“the arrested person can in this manner be kept in custody
indefinitely while the investigation can go on in a leisurely
manner”. Hence the Commission recommended fixing of a
maximum time-limit of 60 days for remand. The
Commission considered the reservation expressed earlier in
Report No. 37 that such an extension may result in the 60-
day period becoming a matter of routine. However, faith
was expressed that proper supervision by the superior
courts would help circumvent the same.
17.6. It was in this backdrop that Section 167(2) was
enacted within the present day CrPC, providing for time-
limits on the period of remand of the accused,
proportionate to the seriousness of the offence committed,
failing which the accused acquires the indefeasible right to
bail. As is evident from the recommendations of the Law
Commission mentioned supra, the intent of the legislature
was to balance the need for sufficient time-limits to
complete the investigation with the need to protect the civil
liberties of the accused. Section 167(2) provides for a clear
mandate that the investigative agency must collect the
required evidence within the prescribed time period, failing
which the accused can no longer be detained. This ensures
that the investigating officers are compelled to act swiftly
and efficiently without misusing the prospect of further
remand. This also ensures that the court takes cognizance
of the case without any undue delay from the date of giving
information of the offence, so that society at large does not
lose faith and develop cynicism towards the criminal justice
17.9. Additionally, it is well-settled that in case of any
ambiguity in the construction of a penal statute, the courts
must favour the interpretation which leans towards
protecting the rights of the accused, given the ubiquitous
power disparity between the individual accused and the
State machinery. This is applicable not only in the case of
substantive penal statutes but also in the case of procedures
providing for the curtailment of the liberty of the accused.
17.10. With respect to the CrPC particularly, the Statement
of Objects and Reasons (supra) is an important aid of
construction. Section 167(2) has to be interpreted keeping in
mind the threefold objectives expressed by the legislature,
namely, ensuring a fair trial, expeditious investigation and trial,
and setting down a rationalised procedure that protects the
interests of indigent sections of society. These objects are
nothing but subsets of the overarching fundamental right
guaranteed under Article 21.
16. From the above decision, it is clear that a time limit for
completing investigation was incorporated in order to ensure that
the accused does not languish in jail for the investigative
authority’s failure to complete investigation. It was held that the
right to statutory bail accrues on a person if the charge sheet is not
filed within the prescribed period of sixty days. The said right to
bail is indefeasible and is interlinked with personal liberty as
envisaged under Article 21 of the Constitution of India.
17. This Court would like to clarify as to when a person is
entitled for statutory bail under Section 167(2) of Cr.P.C. It was
contended on behalf of the Petitioner that Section 167(2) of Cr.P.C.
comes into operation if no cognizance is taken within the
prescribed period. The said contention cannot be accepted. The test
to determine whether a person is entitled for bail under Section
167(2) of Cr.P.C. is not the date of taking cognizance but the date
of filing charge sheet. In other words, the right of statutory bail
ceases to exist the moment a charge sheet is filed within the
prescribed period of sixty or ninety days.
18. The Supreme Court in Rahul Modi (Supra) clarifying
11. It is clear from the judgment of this Court
in Bhikamchand Jain (supra) that filing of a charge-sheet
is sufficient compliance with the provisions of Section
167, CrPC and that an accused cannot demand release on
default bail under Section 167(2) on the ground that
cognizance has not been taken before the expiry of 60
days. The accused continues to be in the custody of the
Magistrate till such time cognizance is taken by the court
trying the offence, which assumes custody of the accused
for the purpose of remand after cognizance is taken. The
conclusion of the High Court that the accused cannot be
remanded beyond the period of 60 days under Section 167
and that further remand could only be at the post-
cognizance stage, is not correct in view of the judgment of
this Court in Bhikamchand Jain (supra).
16. A close scrutiny of the judgments in Sanjay
Dutt (supra), Madar Sheikh (supra) and M. Ravindran
(supra) would show that there is nothing contrary to what
has been decided in Bhikamchand Jain (supra). In all the
above judgments which are relied upon by either side, this
Court had categorically laid down that the indefeasible
right of an accused to seek statutory bail under Section
167(2) of CrPC arises only if the charge-sheet has not
been filed before the expiry of the statutory period.
Reference to cognizance in Madar Sheikh (supra) is in
view of the fact situation where the application was filed
after the charge-sheet was submitted and cognizance had
been taken by the trial court. Such reference cannot be
construed as this Court introducing an additional
requirement of cognizance having to be taken within the
period prescribed under proviso (a) to Section 167(2),
CrPC, failing which the accused would be entitled to
default bail, even after filing of the charge-sheet within the
statutory period. It is not necessary to repeat that in
both Madar Sheikh (supra) and M. Ravindran (supra), this
Court expressed its view that non-filing of the charge-
sheet within the statutory period is the ground for availing
the indefeasible right to claim bail under Section 167(2),
CrPC. The conundrum relating to the custody of the
accused after the expiry of 60 days has also been dealt
with by this Court in Bhikamchand Jain (supra). It was
made clear that the accused remains in custody of the
Magistrate till cognizance is taken by the relevant court.
As the issue that arises for consideration in this case is
squarely covered by the judgment in Bhikamchand
Jain (supra), the order passed by the High Court on
31.05.2019 is hereby set aside.
To decide whether the Petitioner is entitled to statutory bail, this
Court has to decide whether a charge sheet/complaintdated
19.03.2022 was filed or not. It is relevant to note that, in the
present case the proceedings are initiated under the PMLA. Section
44 of the PMLA provides that the offences under PMLA are triable
by Special Courts. The Special Court can take cognizance of an
offence only based on a complaint which is filed by the authorised
authority under Section 44(1)(b) of the PMLA.
19. The complaint filed under Section 44(1)(b) of the PMLA
is similar to a charge sheet/ final report filed under Section 173(2)
of Cr.P.C. In other words, similar to a charge sheet under Section
173(2) of Cr.P.C., a complaint under Section 44(1)(b) of the
PMLA is filed after completion of investigation, so that the Special
Court can take cognizance under Section 167 of the Cr.P.C. It is
relevant to note that the filing of the complaint and subsequent
cognizance under PMLA is governed by the provisions of the
Cr.P.C. in view of Section 65 of the Cr.P.C.
20. In the present case, the Respondent contended that a
complaint under Section 44(1)(b) of the PMLA was already filed
on 19.03.2022. Therefore, the Petitioner is not entitled for statutory
bail under Section 167(2) of the Cr.P.C. This Court cannot accept
the contention of the Respondent as the investigation was not
completed when the complaint dated 19.03.2022 was filed.
21. The Supreme Court in Satya NarainMusadi v. State of
Bihar5 discussing Section 173(2) of the Cr.P.C. has held that a
charge sheet can be filed only after the completion of investigation.
The relevant paragraph is extracted below:
9. Section 173(2)(1) provides that on completion of the
investigation the police officer investigating into a
cognizable offence shall submit a report in the form
prescribed by the State Government and stating therein
(a) the names of the parties; (b) the nature of the
information; (c) the names of the persons who appear to be
acquainted with the circumstances of the case; (d) whether
any offence appears to have been committed and, if so, by
whom (e) whether the accused has been arrested; (f)
whether he has been released on his bond and, if so,
whether with or without sureties; and (g) whether he has
been forwarded in custody under Section 170. Sub-section
(5) of Section 173 makes it obligatory upon the police
officer to forward along with the report all documents or
relevant extracts thereof on which the prosecution
proposes to rely and the statements recorded under Section
161 of all the persons whom the prosecution proposes to
examine as witnesses at the trial.
Similarly, the Supreme Court in Manu Sharma v. State (NCT of
Delhi)6 has held that the object behind Section 173 of the Cr.P.C.
is to complete the investigation and file the charge sheet. The idea
is to ensure that cognizance is taken without any delay. The
relevant paragraph is extracted below:
206. Section 173 commands the investigating agency to
complete the investigation expeditiously without
unnecessary delay and when such an investigation is
completed, the officer in charge of the police station
shall forward to a Magistrate empowered to take
cognizance of offence on a police report the details in
the form as may be prescribed by the State
Government and provide the information required
under this section.
22. From the above decisions, it is clear that a charge sheet
can be filed only after the completion of investigation.
Investigation is said to be completed if sufficient material is
collected by the Investigating Officer based on which cognizance
can be taken under Section 167 of the Cr.P.C. It was contended by
the Respondent that the complaint dated 19.03.2022 is a charge
sheet and only further investigation is being carried out which is
permissible under Section 44(1)(d)(ii). The said contention cannot
be accepted.
23. The Designated Court has extended the remand of the
accused on 31.03.2022 and subsequently on 13.04.2022 under
Section 167(2) of the Cr.P.C. on the ground that investigation is
pending. This clearly indicates that the complaint dated 19.03.2022
was filed without completing the investigation. Therefore, the
complaint dated 19.03.2022 is an incomplete complaint/charge
sheet. Further, if complaint dated 19.03.2022 was filed after
completion of investigation, the Designated Court would have
taken cognizance of the offence. Not taking cognizance of the
offence when complaint dated 19.03.2022 was already filed
indicates that investigation is incomplete. Therefore, complaint
dated 19.03.2022 cannot be treated as a complaint/charge sheet
under Section 173(2) of the Cr.P.C.    The    Supreme    Court   in
Ravindran (Supra) discussed how the Investigating Officers used
to file preliminary charge sheets to seek extension of remand
beyond the statutory period. It was to discourage such abuse of
process that a statutory limit of sixty days was incorporated in
Section 167(2) to complete the investigation and file the charge
sheet. In the present case, the Respondent cannot file a complaint
without completing the investigation and seek extension of remand
beyond the statutory period of sixty days. A complaint/charge sheet
filed without completing the investigation cannot be used to
circumvent the right of statutory bail under Section 167(2) of the
24. The Bombay High Court in Sharadchandra Vinayak
Dongre v. State of Maharashtra7 had to deal with a similar
situation. The State contended that charge sheet was already filed
but the investigation is yet to be completed. The Court therein drew
a distinction between completion of investigation and further
investigation. It held that it is only after the completion of
investigation and filing of charge sheet that further investigation
can be resorted to. In other words, Section 173(8) of the Cr.P.C.
comes into picture only after completion of investigation and filing
of the charge sheet under Section 173(2) of the Cr.P.C. Further, the
court held that by filing incomplete charge sheets, the State cannot
circumvent Section 167(2) of the Cr.P.C. The relevant paragraphs
23. Reference here may usefully be made to a decision
of the Supreme Court in Abhinandan Jha v. Dinesh Mitra,
AIR 1968 SC 117, which points out that the investigation
under the Code takes in several aspects and stages ending
ultimately with the formation of an opinion by the police
as to whether, as from the material covered and collected,
a case is made out to place the accused before the
Magistrate for trial and the submission of either a charge-
sheet or a final report is dependent on the nature of the
opinion so formed. The formation of the said opinion by
the police is the final step in the investigation evidenced
by the “police report” contemplated under section 173(2)
of the Code.
24. In my view, a plain reading of section 173 of the
Code shows that every investigation must be completed
without unnecessary delay and as soon as it is completed,
the Officer-in-charge of the Police Station shall forward a
report to the Magistrate in the form prescribed. Therefore,
there is no question of sending up of a “police report”
within the meaning of section 173, sub-section (2) of
Criminal Procedure Code until the investigation is
completed. Any report sent before the investigation is
completed will not be a police report within the meaning
of sub-section (2) of section 173 of the Criminal Procedure
Code read with section 2(r) of the Code and there is no
question of the Magistrate taking cognizance of the
offence within the meaning of section 190(1)(b) of the
Code on the basis of an incomplete charge-sheet. In the
present case, admittedly an incomplete charge-sheet has
been filed and it is specifically stated therein that the
investigation is not yet completed. The application,
Exhibit 2, clearly further recites that the investigation is
not completed and this fact is even admitted before me as
stated in the reply affidavit filed by the Investigating
Officer opposing the present Application. Consequently,
the incomplete charge-sheets cannot be treated as a “police
report” at all as contemplated under section 173(2) of the
Code to entitle the Magistrate to take cognizance of the
offences. The learned Counsel for the applicants is right in
contending that the definition of “police report” as given
in the Code cannot be enlarged under the guise of
interpretation and it is contended that when the meaning of
a statutory provision is plain and clear, the Court should
not be impelled by factors like practical difficulties and
inconvenience. The learned Counsel appears to be further
right when he canvassed that the expression “incomplete
charge-sheet” does not occur anywhere in the Code and
that forwarding of a “police report” after the completion of
the investigation is the requirement of sub-section (2) of
section 173 of the Code. Any report or statement of facts
in the form of an “incomplete charge-sheet” does not
become “police report” by merely giving a particular
25. The learned Counsel for the State contended
that the new provision added in sub-section (8) of
section 173 of the Code can be resorted to by the
Investigating Officer for collecting further evidence.
According to him, it tends to indicate that the
investigation is not shut but remains in suspended
animation till the police report is sent to the
Magistrate. As has already been pointed out, a police
report as defined in section 2(r) of the Code can only be
filed “as soon as the investigation is completed”. If it is
not complete; no such report can be filed. When no
report is forwarded as required by the Code, the
Magistrate cannot take cognizance. Thus, unless all
these steps are crossed, sub-section (8) cannot be
pressed in aid for collecting further evidence which
really can be called in aid if further evidence is
discovered after the filing of the charge-sheet or the
police report on the completion of the investigation.
26. As stated earlier, sub-section (2) of section 173
of the Code also speaks of taking cognizance of the
offence by a Magistrate on a police report. Thus,
without the police report as defined in section 2(r) of
the Code, the Magistrate is not empowered and is
incapacitated to take cognizance and unless cognizance
has been taken, sub-section (8) cannot be set in motion.
27. The question thus emerges naturally is, whether
the Magistrate can take cognizance on the admittedly
“incomplete charge-sheet” forwarded by the police.
The answer stubbornly and admittedly must be in the
negative, because the investigation is yet incomplete
and the “police report” yet remains to be filed. Thus,
the filing of the incomplete charge-sheet cannot
circumvent the provisions of sub-section (2) of section
173 of the Code and incomplete report or an
incomplete charge-sheet with whatsoever expression it
may be called does not meet the obligatory
requirements of law. If the view as contended by the
State is accepted, the provisions of section 167(2) or to
say section 468 of the Criminal Procedure Code can
always be circumvented by the prosecution and the
apparent legislative intents under those provisions
would not only be not effectuated but undoubtedly
stultified.
25. The Andhra Pradesh High Court in Akula Ravi Teja v.
State of A.P.8 dealt with a situation where a ‘preliminary charge
sheet’ was filed without completing the investigation. The Court
therein held that an incomplete charge sheet filed without
completing the investigation cannot be used to defeat the right of
statutory bail under Section 167(2) of the Cr.P.C. The relevant
19. Now the crucial question that arises for
determination is whether filing a preliminary charge-sheet
without completing the investigation would defeat the right
of the accused to claim default bail under proviso (a) to
Section 167(2) Cr.P.C. In this context, it is relevant to note
that the Parliament in its wisdom, considering the right of
the accused to speedy investigation, stipulated period of
time in proviso (a) to Section 167(2) Cr.P.C. stating that in
all offences which are punishable with death or life
imprisonment or with 10 years imprisonment, the
investigation is to be completed within 90 days and in other
offences, the investigation is to be completed within 60
days. The Code clearly envisaged that if the prosecuting
agency fails to complete the investigation within the said
stipulated period of time as contemplated under the Code,
the accused is entitled to claim default bail. The said right
conferred by the statute on the accused is an indefeasible
right and he is entitled to bail as a matter of right on
account of the default committed by the prosecuting agency
in completing the investigation within the time stipulated
by the statute.
20. It is significant to note that a plain reading of
proviso (a) to Section 167(2) Cr.P.C. makes it manifest that
what is required to claim for default bail under proviso (a)
to Section 167(2) Cr.P.C. is failure on the part of the
Investigating Agency to complete the investigation within
the stipulated period of time. In other words, it is the
default committed by the Investigating Agency to
complete the entire investigation within the stipulated
time that confers right on the accused to claim for
default bail. So, filing of charge-sheet is not the criteria
or the actual test to be applied to decide whether the
accused is entitled to default bail or not. It is relevant to
note that the charge-sheet after completion of
investigation will be filed to enable the Court to take
cognizance of the offence. So, the Court cannot take
cognizance of the offence on the basis of a preliminary
charge-sheet filed without completing the entire
investigation. Therefore, the crucial aspect that needs to
be ascertained to consider the claim of the accused for
default bail is whether the investigation is completed
within the stipulated time of 90 days or not. So, when
the Investigating Agency files only preliminary charge-
sheet within the said stipulated time keeping the
investigation pending or without completing the
investigation, it will not under any circumstances defeat
the right conferred on the accused to claim for default
bail. By mere filing a preliminary charge-sheet without
completing the entire investigation and filing a final and
full-fledged charge-sheet, the prosecuting agency cannot
vanquish the indefeasible statutory right of the accused
to claim for default bail.
21. The 3-Judge Bench of the Supreme Court in the
case of Rakesh Kumar Paul v. State of Assam2 held that
right to personal liberty under Article 21 of the Constitution
of India includes right to speedy investigation and
entitlement to “default bail” where statutory period of filing
charge-sheet has expired and accused has applied and is
willing to furnish bail.
22. A plain reading of Section 167 Cr.P.C. makes it
abundantly clear that it is not the intention of the legislation
that charge-sheet is to be filed within the stipulated period.
The intention of the legislation is that the investigation is to
be completed within the stipulated time. Nowhere in
Section 167 Cr.P.C. it is stated that the charge-sheet is to be
filed within the prescribed period of time. All that it is
stated in Section 167 Cr.P.C. is that the investigation is to
be completed within the said stipulated period of 90 days or
60 days, as the case may be. Therefore, the Court has to
see whether the investigation is completed or not while
considering the plea of the accused for grant of default
bail. Generally, charge-sheet will be filed only after
completion of the investigation. So, when the charge-
sheet is filed, it indicates that investigation is completed.
Therefore, it is in practice that when the Investigating
Agency files the charge-sheet that the Courts usually
presume that the investigation is completed. However, it
is to be noticed that at times, even when the
investigation is not fully completed that the police are in
the habit of filing preliminary charge-sheet or an
incomplete charge-sheet keeping some part of the
investigation pending as a clever contrivance and
subterfuge to prevent the accused from claiming default
bail by exercising his right conferred under the Code.
So, Courts must be on guard and should not fall in the
trap of such trickery and tactics of the investigating
agency when they only file preliminary charge-sheet
without fully completing the investigation. Therefore,
the real test to be applied to ascertain whether the
accused is entitled to default bail or not in a given case
is not to see whether the charge-sheet is filed or not. It
has to be ascertained whether the entire investigation is
completed or not within the stipulated period of time
and whether the said charge-sheet is filed after
completion of the entire investigation or not. A
preliminary charge-sheet filed without completing the
entire investigation cannot be allowed to serve as an
impediment to come in the way of exercising the
statutory right of the accused for default bail.
23. The very contents of the charge-sheet, which are
extracted above, clinchingly establishes that the
investigation is not completed and many crucial witnesses
are yet to be examined to prove the overt acts of the
accused in this crime and some other evidence as stated by
the investigating officer is still to be secured. Therefore, on
account of default committed by the prosecuting agency in
completing the investigation within the stipulated period of
time, the petitioner acquired an indefeasible right to claim
default bail under proviso (a) to Section 167(2) Cr.P.C.
24. In a petition filed under proviso (a) to Section
167(2) Cr.P.C. for grant of default bail, no discretion is
vested with the Magistrate/Court to deny bail to him. In the
judgment of the aforesaid 3-Judge Bench of the Apex
Court, it is clearly held that no discretion is vested with the
Court while granting default bail where accused satisfies
the prerequisite for grant thereof. The Apex Court in
another case Rajnikant JivanlalPatel v. Intelligence Officer,
Narcotic Control Bureau, New Delhi3 held as follows:
“The right to bail under Section 167(2) proviso (a)
thereto is absolute. It is a legislative command and not
Court's discretion. If the investigating agency fails to file
charge-sheet before the expiry of 90/60 days, as the case
may be, the accused in custody should be released on bail.
But at that stage, merits of the case are not to be examined.
Not at all. In fact, the Magistrate has no power to remand a
person beyond the stipulated period of 90/60 days.”
Therefore, the legal position is very clear that
irrespective of the gravity of the offence and the nature and
seriousness of the offence, the moment the accused claims
bail under proviso (a) to Section 167(2) Cr.P.C. on account
of the default committed by the Investigating Agency to
complete the investigation within the stipulated time, and
he is prepared to furnish bail, the Court has no other option
except to grant bail to him. The very nature of right which
is “indefeasible right” indicates that the said right cannot be
defeated or frustrated once accrued to the accused. Even
filing of preliminary charge-sheet cannot defeat the said
25. Therefore, in the considered opinion of the
Court, after analysing the law on the point, it would be
more in consonance with the legislative mandate to hold
that mere filing preliminary charge-sheet without
completing the investigation will not defeat the
indefeasible statutory right of the accused to claim for
default bail. In a way the right to claim bail by a
remanded accused touches the personal liberty of an
individual guaranteed under the Constitution of India.
Personal liberty is a valuable right of an individual and
it is one of the cherished objects of the Indian
Constitution. It can be deprived only in accordance with
law and in conformity with the provisions thereof, as
stipulated under Article 21 of the Constitution.
Therefore, when the law mandates that the Magistrate
could authorise detention of the accused in custody up
to a maximum period as indicated in the proviso to sub-
section (2) of Section 167 Cr.P.C. any further detention
beyond the period when, the investigation is not
completed and the final charge-sheet is not filed on
completion of the entire investigation by the
Investigating Agency would be a subterfuge and would
not be in accordance with law and in conformity with
the provisions of the Criminal Procedure Code.
Therefore, it could be violative of Article 21 of the
Constitution of India.
At the cost of repetition, this Court holds that the complaint dated
19.03.2022 was not a final complaint based on which cognizance
could have been taken. A complaint/report cannot be treated as
final report unless the investigation is completed, In the present
case, the investigation is admittedly not completed and the
statutory period of sixty days expired on 21.03.2022. Therefore, in
the absence of complete investigation and absence of filing a final
complaint, the Petitioner is entitled for statutory bail under Section
167(2) of the Cr.P.C.
26. It was sought to be contended on behalf of the
Respondent that the Petitioner was remanded not under Section
167 of the Cr.P.C. but under Section 309 of the Cr.P.C. The said
contention is ex facie misconceived. The Supreme Court in Dinesh
Dalmia v. CBI9 has held that Section 309 of the Cr.P.C. comes
into operation only after cognizance of the offence is taken. In the
present case, no cognizance is taken till date.
27. The Respondent relying on Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy v.
CBI10 and Ajay Kumar v. Directorate of Enforcement11
contended that economic offences are serious offences. It was
contended that the Petitioner is claiming bail under Section 167(2)
of the PMLA only to circumvent the strict rigors of bail under
Section 45 of the PMLA. The said contention cannot be accepted.
The investigative authority cannot rely on Section 45 of the PMLA
to deny statutory bail under Section 167(2) of the Cr.P.C. The
Supreme Court in Ashok Munilal Jain v. Directorate of
Enforcement12 held that an accused is entitled to statutory bail
under Section 167(2) of the Cr.P.C. even in PMLA proceedings.
The relevant paragraphs are extracted below:
5. We, thus, do not agree with the opinion of the High
Court that the provisions of Section 167(2) CrPC
would not be applicable to the proceedings under the
PMLA Act. In the present case, as no complaint was
filed even after the expiry of 60 days from the date
when the appellant was taken into custody, he was
entitled to statutory bail in view of the provisions
contained in Section 167(2) CrPC.
6. This appeal is, accordingly, allowed and as a result
thereof, the appellant shall be given the benefit of statutory
bail and be released forthwith subject to the conditions that
may be imposed by the trial court.
A perusal of the impugned order dated 08.04.2022 indicates that
the Designated Court has returned the application dated 31.03.2022
seeking extension of remand and the bail application dated
01.04.2022. According to this Court, the Designated Court has no
power to return the said applications. This Court in Kamma
Srinivas Rao (Supra) has held that it is incumbent on the
Designated Court to pass a reasoned order and not merely return
the applications. Neither the Cr.P.C. nor the PMLA contemplates
any provision which empowers the Designated Court to return
applications seeking remand or applications seeking bail. The
relevant paragraphs are extracted below:
47. A perusal of above orders clearly indicates that the
remand applications were returned. According to this
Court, the Designated Court cannot return a remand
application filed under Section 167(2) of Cr.P.C. It is
relevant to note that a Court performs a judicial function
while deciding an application for remand under Section
167(2) of the Cr.P.C. The Court while exercising the
judicial function under Section 167(2) of the Cr.P.C. is
bound to pass a judicial order by applying its mind. The
Court under Section 167 of the Cr.P.C. by passing a
judicial order has to, where there are adequate grounds for
proceeding with the investigation, remand the accused to
judicial custody or where no such further investigation is
required release him on bail on satisfying conditions as
prescribed.
49. It is also relevant to note that neither the Cr.P.C.
nor the Criminal Rules of Practice have any provisions
conferring the power on the Court to return an
application seeking remand under Section 167(2) of the
Cr.P.C. While the Code of Civil Procedure under
Order VII Rules 10 & 10A provides for return of
plaint, no such provision/procedure is provided under
the Cr.P.C.
28. In light of the aforesaid discussion and in view of the law
laid down by the Apex Court discussed supra, according to this
Court, the Petitioner herein is entitled for statutory bail under
Section 167(2) of the Cr.P.C.
i)     The three Criminal Petitions are allowed.
ii)    The orders dated 31.03.2022 and 13.04.2022 passed in
File No. ECIR/HYZO/14/2021 by the Metropolitan
Sessions Judge – cum – Special Court under PMLA
Act, 2002 at Hyderabad extending the remand of the
accused are hereby quashed.
iii)   As the bail application dated 01.04.2022 was returned
on 08.04.2022, the petitioner is at liberty to file a fresh
bail application under Section 167(2) of Cr.P.C. before
the Metropolitan Sessions Judge – cum – Special Court
under PMLA Act, 2002 at Hyderabad. The said Court
is directed to consider the said application if it is
otherwise in order and pass orders in accordance with
law, within a period of one week from the date of filing
of such application.
iv)    Consequently, miscellaneous petitions pending shall
stand closed.
