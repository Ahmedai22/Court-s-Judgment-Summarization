Permission    to   file    special   leave   petition   in   Diary
No.12110/2021 is granted.
These are two connected special leave petitions. Special leave
petition arising out of Diary No.12110/2021 challenges the order
dated 15.05.2021 passed by the Division Bench of the Andhra Pradesh
High Court; whereas Special leave petition (Crl.) No.3785/2021 has
been filed against the order of the Single Judge dated 15.05.2021
of the Andhra Pradesh High Court rejecting the bail of Kanumuri
Raghurama Krishnam Raju. Both the matters were taken up today at
10.30 a.m. when the following order was passed:
“The matters were taken up in the presence of Mr.
Mukul Rohatgi and Mr. B. Adinarayan Rao, learned
senior counsel appearing on behalf of petitioners,
Mr. Dushyant Dave and Mr. V. Giri, learned senior
respondent/State.
Learned counsel for the petitioners is directed to
serve forthwith a copy of the petitions, by e-mail,
to the learned counsel for the respondent/State and
also standing counsel for the Central Government
requesting the presence of Attorney General for
India or the Solicitor General of India at 12:00
noon today.
By the consent of learned counsel for the parties,
matters shall be taken up at 12:00 noon today.”
Besides    the    counsel   for    the   petitioners    and   the
respondent/State,   Shri  Tushar  Mehta,   learned  Solicitor  General
appeared for the Union of India.
The submission of Shri Mukul Rohatgi, learned senior counsel
for the petitioners is that petitioner-Kanumuri Raghurama Krishnam
Raju is the sitting Member of Parliament and an FIR has been filed
against the petitioner-Kanumuri Raghurama Krishnam Raju because of
political  rivalry   as  though  he  was  elected  as  an  M.P.  of  a
particular political party but he criticized the action of said
party and hence FIR has been filed because of political vendetta.
At this stage, we are not inclined to go into the merits of
the allegations made in the FIR and the submissions in that regard
made by learned counsel for the petitioners as at present we are
concerned with the medical condition of the petitioner-Kanumuri
Raghurama Krishnam Raju regarding which there has been remarks by
the Magistrate in his order dated 15.05.2021 when he was produced
before the Magistrate for remand. The Magistrate has directed to
refer the petitioner-Kanumuri Raghurama Krishnam Raju for medical
examination to the “Superintendent of Government Hospital General
Hospital, Guntur and Ramesh Hospital, Guntur to get examine the
accused person in the presence of his security of Y category”. The
Magistrate had also noted the contention of the learned counsel for
the accused that the police had used 3 rd degree methods against him
during his custody and he was unable to walk and also that the
petitioner-Kanumuri  Raghurama  Krishnam  Raju  had  undergone  heart
bye-pass surgery in   December, 2020. Thereafter, Division Bench of
the High Court by its order dated 15.05.2021 had directed that the
medical examination be conducted by the medical board headed by the
Superintendent of Government General Hospital, Guntur with other
government doctors as members of the Board. Today medical report
has been placed before us which we have perused.
Mr. Dushyant Dave, learned senior counsel appearing for the
respondent/State has very fairly stated that the State Government
would have no objection if Kanumuri Raghurama Krishnam Raju is
again  medically  examined  by  an  independent   Central  Government
Hospital in the presence of a Judicial Officer.         He suggested that
the petitioner-Kanumuri Raghurama Krishnam Raju may be examined at
AIIMS Mangalagiri, Andhra Pradesh or in the alternative Manipal
Hospital, Andhra Pradesh which is a private hospital.
Shri Mukul Rohatgi, learned senior counsel appearing for the
petitioners has submitted that the AIIMS Mangalagiri is a very new
hospital which is not properly staffed and Manipal Hospital is a
private   hospital.    In   the  alternative     he  suggested    that   the
petitioner-Kanumuri Raghurama Krishnam Raju may be sent to AIIMS,
New Delhi for medical examination on his own expenses.
Shri Tushar Mehta, learned Solicitor General appearing for the
Union of India did not object to the same.
This   Court   suggested   that   the  medical   examination    of  the
petitioner-Kanumuri    Raghurama   Krishnam    Raju  be   conducted   by  an
independent organization and in the opinion of the Court it could
be done at the Army Hospital Secunderabad, Telangana, to which Shri
Dushyant Dave as well as Shri V. Giri, learned senior counsel as
well  as   Shri   Tushar   Mehta,  learned    Solicitor    General   had  no
However,   it   was  submitted   by   Shri  Dushyant   Dave   that  the
petitioner-Kanumuri Raghurama Krishnam Raju be sent to the Army
Hospital Secunderabad, Telangana only for medical examination and
not for treatment or hospitalization.
Considering the totality of the facts and circumstances, as
well as keeping in view the directions issued by the Magistrate and
also the High Court at various stages and particularly taking into
consideration that Kanumuri Raghurama Krishnam Raju has undergone
heart bye-pass surgery very recently and the injuries noticed in
the medical report, we deem it proper to direct as under:
