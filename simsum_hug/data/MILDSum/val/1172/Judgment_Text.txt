Mr. Siddhant Arora, Advocate for the petitioner.
Prayer in the present petition is for grant of regular bail to the
petitioner in FIR No.58 dated 01.05.2020 registered under Sections 21, 25
and 29 of the NDPS Act, 1985 and Sections 307, 427, 270 read with Section
34 of Indian Penal Code, 1860 at Police Station Special Task Force, District
Learned counsel for the petitioner has submitted that the
petitioner is in custody since 01.05.2020 (more than 2 years and 6 months)
and the investigation is complete and challan has been presented and there
are 14 prosecution witnesses, out of which, none have been examined as yet
and thus, the conclusion of trial is likely to take time. It is further submitted
that the petitioner is not involved in any other case. It is contended that no
injury has been caused to any police officials and rather one gunshot injury
has been suffered by the present petitioner on the left leg. It is further
contended that further incarceration of the petitioner would be violative of
the right of the petitioner enshrined under Article 21 of the Constitution of
Learned counsel for the petitioner has relied upon an order
dated 12.01.2022 passed by the Division Bench of this Court in CRM-
3773-2019 in CRA-D-198-DB-2017 titled as Bhupender Singh Vs.
Narcotic Control Bureau, order dated 22.08.2022 passed by the Hon'ble
Supreme Court in Special Leave to Appeal (Crl.) No.5530-2022 titled as
"Mohammad Salman Hanif Shaikh Vs. The State of Gujarat, order dated
07.02.2020 passed by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Criminal Appeal
No.245/2020 titled as "Chitta Biswas Alias Subhas Vs. The State of West
Bengal", order dated 05.08.2022 passed by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in
Criminal Appeal No.1169 of 2022 titled as "Gopal Krishna Patra @
Gopalrusma Vs. Union of India,", order dated 01.08.2022 passed by the
Hon'ble Supreme Court in Special Leave to Appeal (Crl.) No.5769/2022
titled as "Nitish Adhikary @ Bapan Vs. The State of West Bengal", in
support of his arguments that on the basis of long custody alone, the
petitioner deserves the concession of regular bail.
On the other hand, learned State Counsel has opposed the
present petition for grant of regular bail to the petitioner and has submitted
that the recovery effected from the petitioner and co-accused is of
commercial quantity and thus, the bar under Section 37 of the NDPS Act
would apply.
This Court has heard the learned counsel for the parties and has
perused the paper book.
The Hon'ble Supreme Court in Mohammad Salman Hanif
Shaikh's case (Supra), had held as under:-
"We are inclined to release the petitioner on bail only on
the ground that he has spent about two years in custody and
conclusion of trial will take some time.
Consequently, without expressing any views on the
merits of the case and taking into consideration the custody
period of the petitioner, this special leave petition is accepted
and the petitioner is ordered to be released on bail subject to
his furnishing the bail bonds to the satisfaction of the Special
Judge/ concerned Trial Court.
The special leave petition is, accordingly, disposed of in
the above terms.
Pending application(s), if any, shall also stand disposed
The above-said case was also a case under the NDPS Act, 1985
and the FIR had been registered under Sections 8(c), 21(c) and 29 of the
said Act. The case of the prosecution therein was that the recovery from the
said petitioner (therein) was of commercial quantity. The Hon'ble Supreme
Court had observed that the concession of bail was granted to the petitioner
(therein) only on the ground that he had spent about two years in custody
and the conclusion of trial will take some time.
Hon'ble Supreme Court in Chitta Biswas Alias Subhas's case
(Supra) was pleased to grant concession of bail to the petitioner (therein) in
a case where the custody was of 1 year and 7 months approximately. The
relevant portion of the said order dated 07.02.2020 is as under: -
This appeal arises out of the final Order dated
30.7.2010 passed by the High Court of Calcutta in CRM
No.6787 of 2019. The instant matter arises out of
application preferred by the appellant under Section 439
Cr.P.C. seeking bail in connection with Criminal Case
No.146 of 2018 registered with Taherpur Police Station for
offence punishable under Section 21-C of the Narcotic
Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985.
According to the prosecution, the appellant was found
to be in possession of narcotic substance i.e. 46 bottles of
phensydryl cough syrup containing codeine mixture above
commercial quantity.
The appellant was arrested on 21.07.2018 and
continues to be in custody. It appears that out of 10
witnesses cited to be examined in support of the case of
prosecution four witnesses have already been examined in
the trial.
Without expressing any opinion on the merits or
demerits of the rival submissions and considering the facts
and circumstances on record, in our view, case for bail is
made out. We therefore, allow this appeal and direct as
(a) Subject to furnishing bail bond in the sum of Rs.2 lakhs
with two like sureties to the satisfaction of the Judge, Special
Court, NDPS Act, Nadia at Krishnagar, the appellant shall
be released on bail.
(b) The Special Court may impose such other conditions as
it deems     appropriate to ensure the presence and
participation of the appellant in the pending trial. With the
aforesaid directions, the appeal stands allowed."
In Gopal Krishna Patra @ Gopalrusma's case (Supra), the
Hon'ble Supreme Court was pleased to observe as under: -
"Leave granted.
This appeal challenges the judgment and order dated
25.01.2022 passed by the High Court Of Madhya Pradesh,
Principal Seat at Jabalpur, in MCRC No.117/2022. The
appellant is in custody since 18.06.2020 in connection with
crime registered as N.C.B. Crime No.02/2020 in respect of
offences punishable under Sections 8, 20, 27-AA, 28 read with
29 of the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act,
The application seeking relief of bail having been
rejected, the instant appeal has been filed.
We have heard Mr. Ashok Kumar Panda, learned Senior
Advocate in support of the appeal and Mr. Sanjay Jain,
learned Additional Solicitor General for the respondent.
Considering the facts and circumstances on record and
the length of custody undergone by the appellant, in our view
the case for bail is made out.
(a) The appellant shall be produced before the Trial Court
within five days from today.
(b) The Trial Court shall release the appellant on bail subject
to such conditions as the Trial Court may deem appropriate to
impose.
(c) The appellant shall not in any manner misuse his liberty.
(d) Any infraction shall entail in withdrawal of the benefit
granted by this Order.
The appeal is allowed in aforesaid terms."
A perusal of the above-said order would show that in the said
case also the custody was of approximately 2 years, 1 month and 17 days
and the case was under the NDPS Act, 1985 and primarily, considering the
length of the custody period, concession of bail was granted to the petitioner
The Hon'ble Supreme Court of India in Nitish Adhikary @
Bapan's case (Supra) has observed as under: -
"As per the office report dated 29.07.2022, copy of the
show cause notice along with Special Leave Petition was
supplied to the Standing Counsel for the State of West Bengal
and separate notice has been served on the State also.
However, no one has entered appearance on their behalf.
The petitioner seeks enlargement on bail in F.I.R. No.
612 of 2020 dated 17.10.2020 filed under Section 21(c) and 37
of the NDPS Act, registered at Police Station Bongaon, West
During the course of the hearing, we are informed that
the petitioner has undergone custody for a period of 01 year
and 07 months as on 09.06.2022. The trial is at a preliminary
stage, as only one witness has been examined. The petitioner
does not have any criminal antecedents.
Taking into consideration the period of sentence
undergone     by    the   petitioner  and    all   the   attending
circumstances but without expressing any views in the merits of
the case, we are inclined to grant bail to the petitioner.
The petitioner is accordingly, directed to be released on
bail subject to him furnishing bail bonds to the satisfaction of
the Trial Court.
The Special Leave Petition is disposed of on the
aforestated terms.
Pending application(s), if any, shall stand disposed of."
A perusal of the said order would also show that the said case
was under the NDPS Act, 1985 and the provisions of Section 37 of the
NDPS Act, 1985 were also mentioned in the same and the bail was granted
primarily by considering the petitioner (therein) had undergone custody for
a period of 01 year and 07 months and only one witness had been examined.
The Division Bench of this Court in Bhupender Singh's case
(Supra), had also held that in case, the accused person is able to make out a
case within the parameters of Article 21 of the Constitution of India in view
of the custody period, then he deserves the concession of regular bail, even
in the face of rigors of Section 37 of the NDPS Act, 1985.
In the present case, the petitioner is in custody since 01.05.2020
(more than 2 years and 6 months) and the investigation is complete and
challan has been presented and out of 14 prosecution witnesses, none have
been examined as yet and thus, the conclusion of trial is likely to take time.
The petitioner is stated to be not involved in any other case and further
incarceration of the petitioner would be violative of the right of the
petitioner enshrined under Article 21 of the Constitution of India.
Keeping in view the abovesaid facts and circumstances as also
the law laid down in the abovecited judgments, this Court deems it
appropriate to grant the concession of regular bail to the petitioner. Further,
this Court proposes to impose such conditions that would meet the object of
Section 37 of the NDPS Act, 1985.
Accordingly, the present petition is allowed and the petitioner
is ordered to be released on regular bail on his furnishing bail/surety bonds
to the satisfaction of the trial Court/Duty Magistrate, subject to him not
being required in any other case. The petitioner shall also abide by the
following conditions:-
1.     The petitioner will not tamper with the evidence during the trial.
2.     The petitioner will not pressurize/intimidate the prosecution witness
3.     The petitioner will appear before the trial Court on the date fixed,
unless personal presence is exempted.
4.     The petitioner shall not commit an offence similar to the offence of
which he is an accused, or for commission of which he is suspected.
5.     The petitioner shall not directly or indirectly make any inducement,
threat or promise to any person acquainted with the facts of the case
so as to dissuade him/her from disclosing such facts to the Court or to
any police officer or tamper with the evidence.
In case of breach of any of the above conditions, the
prosecution shall be at liberty to move an application for cancellation of bail
before this Court.
However, nothing stated above shall be construed as an
expression of opinion on the merits of the case and the trial would proceed
independently of the observations made in the present case which are only
for the purpose of adjudicating the present bail application.
All the pending miscellaneous applications, if any, stand
disposed of in view of the abovesaid judgment.
