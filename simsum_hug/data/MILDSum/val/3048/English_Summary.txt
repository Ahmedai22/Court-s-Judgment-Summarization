The Punjab and Haryana High Court earlier this week ordered an inquiry into a series of tweets allegedly made against the court. The Bench of Justice Raj Mohan Singh has set a three-week deadline for its Registrar-Vigilance to enquire into the tweets enquired.
 Case in brief
 Petitioner Vishali Kapoor was granted anticipatory bail by the High Court in a case registered for the offence under Section 306 IPC for allegedly abetting the suicide of the father of the Complainant.
 Apparently, aggrieved by the fact that the petitioner had been granted bail, the complainant posted certain tweets and Facebook posts against the Court and in one of the tweets, he even posted the picture of the Judge who had granted the Pre-arrest bail to the petitioner and had posted some derogatory remarks as well.
 The counsel for the petitioner supplied the screenshots of the tweets made by the complainant before the Court, to which notice was taken by the bench of Justice Raj Mohan Singh.
 Court's order

 The Registrar Vigilance has also been given the liberty to seek the assistance of the police or any other expert in this regard. Report to that effect be brought on record
 In view of aforesaid facts and circumstances of the case, the matter was directed to be listed before some other Bench on August 16, 2021 after obtaining necessary orders from the Chief Justice.
