Correctness or otherwise of the judgment and order dated
06.09.2021, passed in Criminal Revision No. 17/2019, by the learned
Additional District Judge, Bilasipara by which the learned Additional
District Judge, Bilasipara has affirmed the judgment and order dated
04.10.2019 passed in Misc. Case No. 244/2017 by the learned Sub-
Divisional Judicial Magistrate(M), Bilasipara under Section 125 of the Code
of Criminal Procedure, 1973 granting maintenance to the respondent,
namely, Smti Bhanjana Kalita, is put to challenge in this petition under
Section 482 of the Cr.P.C. by the petitioner, namely, Shri Tarun Chandra
2.   It is to be noted here that vide impugned judgment and order dated
04.10.2019 in Misc. Case No. 244/2017, the learned Sub-Divisional Judicial
Magistrate(M), Bilasipara has directed the petitioner to pay a sum of Rs.
5000/- (Rupees five thousand) per month to the respondent under Section
125 of the Cr.P.C.
3.    The factual background leading to filing of the present petition is
“The respondent, namely,     Smti Bhanjana Kalita is the wife of the
petitioner, namely, Shri Tarun Chandra Das. Their marriage was
solemnised on 28.04.2017 as per Hindu rights and rituals. After the
marriage, the petitioner took the respondent to the house of his
sister, namely, Smti Latika Das and stayed there for a month and
thereafter, they shifted to a rented house at Bilasipara and lived
there as husband and wife. After two months of living together as
husband and wife, the petitioner took the respondent to his own
house at Arearjhar. After reaching the house of the petitioner, the
respondent got surprised to see the first wife of the petitioner.
Before marriage, the petitioner told the respondent that he has
already divorced his first wife and shown her some fake documents.
Then being left with no option, the respondent tried to adjust herself
with the petitioner and started leading a conjugal life. Thereafter,
the petitioner started picking up quarrel with the respondent without
any rhyme or reason and started torturing her both physically and
mentally and also demanded money on the advice of other persons.
Then on 06.11.2017, at about 10.45 p.m., the petitioner tried to kill
the respondent by wrapping her neck by means of one gamosa, but
somehow she managed to escape and reported the matter to her
family members. But at the intervention of her family members, she
again started to live with the petitioner. Then on 11.11.2017, the
petitioner became violent and assaulted her badly and drove her out
of the matrimonial house. Though the family members of the
respondent tried to settle the matter amicably, yet the same failed to
yield any result. The petitioner is a Government employee under the
Agriculture Department and posted at Bilasipara Agriculture Office
and he is a person of sound health and receives salary of Rs.
40,000/- and he has also landed property. And on the other hand
respondent is unable to maintain herself and despite having
sufficient means, the petitioner has not been maintaining the
respondent. Then being left with no other option, she filed one
petition before the learned Sub-Divisional Judicial Magistrate (M),
Bilasipara under Section 125 Cr.P.C. Thereafter, hearing both the
parties, the learned Sub-Divisional Judicial Magistrate(M), Bilasipara
vide order dated 04.10.2019, directed the petitioner to pay
maintenance @ Rs. 5000/- (five thousand). Then being aggrieved by
the aforesaid judgment and order of the learned Sub-Divisional
Judicial Magistrate (M), Bilasipara dated 04.10.2019; the petitioner
preferred one revision petition before the learned Additional
Sessions Judge, Bilasipara, being Crl. Rev. No. 17/2019. Thereafter,
vide judgment and order dated 06.09.2021, the learned Additional
Sessions Judge, Bilasipara has affirmed the judgment and order of
the learned Sub-Divisional Judicial Magistrate(M), Bilasipara, dated
04.10.2019 passed in Misc. Case No. 244/2017.
4.  Being highly aggrieved, the petitioner preferred this petition on the
(i). The learned Courts below failed to appreciate the fact that
expression ‘wife’ under Section 125 of the Cr.P.C. should be
interpreted to mean only a legally wedded wife. The word
‘wife’ is not defined in the Code except indicating in the
explanation to the Section 125 Cr.P.C., its inclusive character
so as to cover a divorcee. A woman cannot be a divorcee
unless there was a marriage solemnized between any two
Hindus after following the conditions mentioned in Section 5
of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955. But the learned Courts
below failed to take into consideration the fact and arrive at a
conclusion that the respondent herein is a legally wedded
wife of the petitioner for her entitlement to maintenance as
per Section 125 of the Cr.P.C.
(ii). That, the marriage of a woman in accordance with Hindu
rights with a man having a living spouse is a complete nullity
in the eye of law and therefore, she is not entitled to the
benefit of Section 125 Cr.P.C.
(iii). That, as per Section 5 of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955, a
marriage with a person having a living spouse is not
permissible and the same is void and not voidable.
(iv). That, Section 11 of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955, wherefrom
it is clear as to when a marriage can be declared as null and
void. As per Section 11 a marriage can be declared as nullity
if it contravenes any of the conditions specified in Clause –(i),
(iv), (v) of Section 5 of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955.
(v). That, to be entitled for maintenance under Section 125 of the
Cr.P.C., the burden is always on the person who claims herself
to be the legally married wife of the person from whom she
claims maintenance. And in the case in hand, the respondent
has miserably failed to prove that she is legally married with
the petitioner and the same fulfil the condition for a Hindu
marriage as laid down in Section 5 of the Hindu Marriage Act,
(vi). That cross-examination of the respondent (PW-1) shows that
she knows the petitioner since the childhood as they belong
to the same village and she also knew about the first
marriage of the petitioner. Even then, the learned Courts
below have arrived at a conclusion that the respondent is the
legally married wife of the petitioner.
(vii). That, the petitioner and the respondent entered into a
marriage by way of registration under Notary Public and the
same has not been considered by the learned Courts below.
(viii). That there is no scope for artificial definition of ‘wife’ to
include a woman not lawfully married. Therefore, it is
contended to allow the petition by setting aside the impugned
judgments and orders.
5.  It is to be noted here that the respondent here in this case has not
submitted her affidavit-in-opposition.
6.  I have heard Mr. S. Biswas, learned counsel for the petitioner. Also
heard Mr. M. Hussain, learned counsel for the respondent.
7.    Mr. Biswas, learned counsel for the petitioner submits that the
learned Courts below have committed grave error in interpreting the word
‘wife’ in Section 125 of the Cr.P.C, and wrongly granted maintenance in
favour of the respondent without there being any valid marriage between
the parties. It is further submitted that the respondent and the petitioner
belongs to the same village and they knows each other since childhood
and as such she married with the petitioner knowing well about
subsistence of his first marriage, and as such, the impugned judgments
and orders suffer from gross illegality and impropriety and therefore, it is
contended to set them aside by allowing the petition. Mr. Biswas has
referred one Case Law Savitaben Somanhai Bhatiya vs. State of
Gujarat and Ors. reported in (2005) 3 SCC 636, to make good of his
9.     On the other hand, Mr. M. Hussain, learned counsel for the
respondent submits that no irregularity or illegality is committed by the
learned Courts below in granting maintenance to the respondent. It is
submitted that the petitioner got married with the respondent by
suppressing his first marriage and now he cannot take the benefit of
subsistence of his first marriage with his former wife. It is further
submitted that the petitioner misrepresented the respondent that he has
divorced his first wife and shown some documents and as such, the
question of non-fulfilment of Section 5(1) of the Hindu Marriage Act does
not arise. Mr. Hussain, learned counsel also referred one case law,
Badshah vs Urmila Badshah Godse & Anr. reported in (2014) 1
SCC 188, to submit that the petition has been filed under Section 125 of
the Cr.P.C. and that the respondent should be treated as legally wedded
wife and that he duped the respondent by suppressing her earlier
marriage and therefore, the petitioner cannot deny maintenance to the
respondent and therefore, it is contended to dismiss the petition by
affirming the judgments of the learned Court below.
10.   Having heard the submission of learned counsels of both sides, I
have gone through the petition and the documents placed on record and
the impugned judgments of the learned Courts below and also, the case
law referred hereinabove by the learned counsels of both sides. Also I
have perused the evidence recorded by the learned Court below, so as to
satisfy myself as to the correctness, legality and propriety of the finding of
the learned Court below, in view of the observation of Hon’ble Supreme
Court in State Of Maharashtra vs. Jagmohan Singh Kuldip Singh
Anand reported in AIR 2004 SC 4412, where it has been held that
Section 401 Cr.P.C. has enabled the revisional court to exercise all powers
to appellate Court (Section 386), if necessary, in aid of power of
superintendence or supervision for the purpose of satisfying itself or
himself as to the correctness, legality or propriety of any finding, sentence
or order, passed as to the regularity of any proceeding.
11.   In the case in hand, the petitioner, in his written statement has
admitted having married the respondent in no uncertain terms and also
admitted living with her as husband and wife. At first in the house of his
sister and thereafter, at the rented house in Bilasipara for about 4 (four)
months and upon the aforesaid admission and also the evidence adduced
by the respondent, the learned Court below held that the respondent is
the married wife of the petitioner and they lived together as husband and
wife and thereby, fulfilled the requirement of Section 125 of the Cr.P.C.
Though the learned counsel for the petitioner submits that as per Section
11 of the Hindu Marriage Act, the marriage between the petitioner and the
respondent is a nullity as it contravenes the provision of Clause –(i), (iv),
(v) of Section 5 of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 yet, the said submission
left this Court unimpressed and the ratio laid down by the Hon’ble
Supreme Court in the case of Savitaben Somanhai Bhatiya (supra)
would not come into his aid. The ratio in Savitaben Somanhai
Bhatiya’s (supra) case would apply only in those circumstances where a
woman married a man with full knowledge of the first subsisting marriage.
In such cases, she should know that second marriage with such a person
is impermissible and there is an embargo under the Hindu Marriage
Act and therefore she has to suffer the consequences thereof. Though the
learned counsel for the petitioner has submitted that the respondent and
the petitioner belongs to the same village and they knows each other
since childhood and as such she married with the petitioner knowing well
about subsistence of his first marriage, yet, such submission left this court
unimpressed as there is material on record to show that the petitioner had
married the respondent by saying and showing fake documents that he
had divorced his 1st wife.
12. In the case of Veerappa vs. Michael reported in AIR 1963 SC
933, Hon’ble Supreme Court has held that once a marriage in fact is
proved to have taken place, the presumption arising there from in favour
of a marriage in law would operate with all its amplitude and plenitude to
entitle the wife of such a marriage to entertain an application under
Section 125 of the Cr.P.C., unless, on the materials on record, the marriage
in question appears to be stamped on its face with indisputable illegality
and the invalidity thereof stares at the face, as it did in the case of
Yamunabai v. Anantrao (1983 Crl. LJ 259).
13.   In Dwarika Prasad Satpathy v. Bidyut Prava Dixit and Anr.
reported in AIR 1999 SC 1348 and in Chanmunia Vs. Virendra
Kumar Singh Kushwaha & Another, : (2011) 1 SCC 141, it has
“the parties had been living together for a long time and on
that basis question arose as to whether there would be a
presumption of marriage between the two because of the
said reason, thus, giving rise to claim of maintenance
under Section 125,Cr.P.C. by interpreting the term “wife”
widely. The Court has impressed that if man and woman
have been living together for a long time even without a
valid marriage, as in that case, term of valid marriage
entitling such a woman to maintenance should be drawn
and a woman in such a case should be entitled to maintain
application under Section 125,Cr.P.C.”
14. In the case of Suo Malan vs. Balasahed Bhimrao Guwade and
“..proceedings under S. 125 of the Cr.P.C. are in the nature
of the summary proceedings. By providing a simple and
speedy remedy the legislature has provided for a limited
relief for the neglected wives, children and parents. S. 125
of the Cr.P.C. is not intended to provide for a full and final
determination of the status and personal rights of the
parties. It is true that a woman whose marriage is void
cannot get the status of a legally wedded wife and is not
entitled to maintenance under this Section. But it is
important to bear in mind that in such proceedings all that
the wife has to prove is the performance of certain marriage
ceremonies and it is immaterial whether the same satisfy all
the requirements of a valid marriage. The party who
challenges the validity of the marriage has to establish it in
a competent civil court. Therefore, it was for the first
respondent hue to have gone to a competent civil court and
get his marriage annulled. Not having done that, it is not for
the courts below to go to his rescue and declare that the
marriage between him and the petitioner was not legal.
That was not the function of the courts dealing with an
application under S. 125 of the Cr.P.C. In the absence of a
declaration by competent civil court about the legality or
otherwise of the marriage between the petitioner and the
first respondent, the lower courts should have presumed
that the said marriage was legal..”
15. Again in the case of Badshah vs. Urmila Badshah Godse & Anr.
reported in (2014) 1 SCC 188, Hon’ble Supreme Court in paragraph-
“We are dealing with a situation where the marriage
between the parties has been proved. However, the
petitioner was already married. But he duped the
respondent by suppressing the factum of alleged first
marriage. On these facts, in our opinion, he cannot be
permitted to deny the benefit of maintenance to the
respondent, taking advantage of his own wrong.”
16. Thus, in view of the above case laws of Hon’ble Supreme Court in
Virappa vs. Michael (supra) Dwarika Prasad Satpathy v. Bidyut
Prava Dixit and Anr.(supra), Chanmunia Vs. Virendra Kumar
Singh Kushwaha & Another(supra) Badshah vs. Urmila Badshah
Godse & Anr. (supra), there is no escape from the proposition that once
marriage in fact proved to have been taken place, the presumption arising
there from in favour of marriage in law would operate with all its
amplitude and plenitude to entitled the wife to such a marriage to
entertain an application under section 125 Cr.P.C., unless on the materials
on record the marriage in question appears to be stamped on its face with
indisputable illegality and the invalidity thereof stares at the face. Once
such presumption of a lawful marriage commenced to operate in favour of
a marriage which has taken place in fact, such a presumption alone would
be good enough to entitle the wife to maintain an application for
maintenance under section 125 Cr.P.C. unless on the material on record,
the presumption stands dislodged and overthrown.
17. Here in this case, solemnisation of marriage between both the parties
and subsequent living together as husband and wife for about six months
stands established and the said facts are admitted by the petitioner also.
And as such presumption arising there from in favour of the marriage in
law will operate with all its amplitude and plenitude to entitle the wife to
such a marriage to entertain an application under section 125 Cr.P.C.
There is nothing on the record to dislodge or over throw such a
presumption. And as such the learned courts below has rightly arrived at a
conclusion that the respondent/1st party is the wife of the petitioner/2 nd
party. In the given facts and circumstances, this court is of the considered
opinion that at least for the purpose of claiming maintenance under
section 125 Cr.P.C. the respondent/1st party is entitled to claim to be the
wife of the petitioner. Mention to be made here that the petitioner has not
challenged the validity of his marriage with the respondent/1 st party in
any court of law.
18. The learned court below has determined the quantum of maintenance
@Rs. 5000/(Rupees five thousand) per month. Admittedly, the petitioner
is serving in Agriculture Department, at Bilashipara. His monthly salary is
about Rs. 40000/, the factum of which is not seriously disputed by
producing any documents like salary certificate etc. The respondent is a
house wife having no source of income of her own. Though the learned
counsel for the petitioner has submitted that she has been serving in a
school, yet no evidence to that effect is lead by him before the learned
court below. Nor such a fact is brought on record by filing any affidavit
before this court. In view of above the quantum of maintenance so
decided by the learned court below appears to be justified and it requires
no interference of this court.
“The obligation to maintain wife and minor children, who are
unable to maintain themselves, flows from the right of the man
to marry and to setup a family as recognised in Article-16 of the
Universal Declaration of Human Right, which also provides that
ä family as fundamental group unit of the society, is entitled to
protection by the society and the state. This is fulfilled by
section 125 Cr.P.C. considering that wife and children are not
left beggared and destitute by providing them with a speedy
and effective remedy.”
20. Section 125 Cr.P.C. is a measure of social justice, enacted to protect
the vulnerable section of the society like women, children and infirm
parents and it within the scope of Article -15(3) and 39 of the Constitution
of India. The object of this section is not to punish for the past, but to
prevent the vulnerable section of the society, who are unable to maintain
themselves, so that they are left beggared and destitute on the scrap
heap of the society, and thereby driven to a life of vagrancy, immorality
and crime for their sustenance, by compelling those who are capable to
support to perform their moral obligation.
21. While the impugned judgments of the learned courts below are
examined in the light of the propositions of law, discussed herein above, I
find that the conclusion so arrived at by the learned courts below are not
suffering from any illegality or impropriety requiring this court to interfere
with the same in exercising its inherent jurisdiction under section 482
Cr.P.C. In the result I find no merit in this petition and accordingly the
same stands dismissed. The parties have to bear their own cost.
