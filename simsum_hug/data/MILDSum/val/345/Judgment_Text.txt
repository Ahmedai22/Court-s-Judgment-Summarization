1.     By way of the present application, permission has been sought
by petitioner/accused Amrinder Singh @ Raja to file the petition
bearing No. CRL.M.C. 1571/2021 seeking quashing of FIR No.
258/2010 and the charge-sheet and all the proceedings arising
therefrom including the proceedings initiated against the petitioner u/s
82/83 of the Code of Criminal Procedure through his S.P.A. holder Sh.
Sukhjinder Singh S/o Mohinder Singh aged about 38 years R/o H. No.-
489, Street No. 8 Ghuman Nagar, Sarhandh Road, Patiala Punjab who
is the brother of the petitioner/accused. The present application under
disposal has been signed by the said SPA of the petitioner/accused. The
affidavit in support of this application has also been executed by the
said SPA holder.
2.     The title of the petition bearing No. CRL.M.C. 1571/2021 reads
The State of NCT of Delhi.
3.     I have heard the Ld. counsel for the petitioner, Ld. APP for the
State and perused the records of this case.
4.     It is contended by the Ld. counsel for the petitioner/accused that
the petitioner/accused has not been named in the FIR and there is no
admissible      evidence    against  the   petitioner/accused      and the
petitioner/accused has only been made an accused on the basis of the
disclosure statement of the co-accused. It is further submitted by the
Ld. counsel for the petitioner/accused that there is nothing on record to
show that the petitioner was a travel agent doing the business of travel
agency or was doing any business ancillary to travel agency. He further
submitted that the petitioner is a business man and working as a
Director of an NRI company, the fact which was thoroughly
investigated by the IO in May 2010. It is further submitted by the Ld.
counsel for the petitioner/accused that the order dated 05.03.2016
declaring the petitioner/accused as absconder is bad in law and has
been passed without following the due procedure.
5.     On the other hand, it is submitted by the Ld. APP for the State
that there are allegations against the petitioner/accused and it cannot be
said that the case is of no evidence. It is further submitted by the Ld.
APP that this is not the first time that the petitioner has been declared
absconder and he further submitted that the petitioner was previously
declared PO vide order dated 20.12.2011 and the said proceedings were
dropped vide order dated 11.11.13 when an application in this regard
was moved by the petitioner/accused for dropping of the proceedings
U/s 82 Cr.P.C. It is further submitted by the Ld. APP that despite this,
the petitioner did not mend his ways and again failed to appear before
the trial Court and he was again declared absconder vide order dated
6.     It is vehemently argued by the Ld. APP that the present petition
under article 227 of the Constitution of India read with section 482 of
the Code of Criminal Procedure is not maintainable as the same has
been filed through S.P.A. holder and the present application and
petition are liable to be dismissed.
(Criminal) 586; it has been observed as under:-
“9. The plain reading of the ratio of law, laid down, in
the aforesaid cases, clearly goes to reveal, that it is
only the accused person, against whom, a criminal
case, has been registered or a criminal complaint, has
been filed, can file a petition, under Section 482
Cr.P.C., in the High Court, for quashing the
complaint, the summoning order, and the subsequent
proceedings, and no third person, can fight a proxy
war, on his behalf, under the garb of public interest
litigant. The aggrieved party, which is affected by an
order, is required to seek redress of its grievance, by
questioning the legal validity or correctness of the
same. It is another thing, if the aggrieved party, is
suffering from some disability i.e. unless such party is
a minor, an insane person, or is suffering from any
other disability, which, in law, is recognized as
sufficient to permit any other person e.g. next friend,
to move the Court, on his behalf. On behalf of minor,
or insane person, a guardian or a next friend, initiates
proceedings, so as to challenge the legality and
validity of the order, passed against him, to seek
redressal of the grievance, as under law, such a person
having disability, cannot be said to be competent, to
file a petition, except through next friend or guardian.
In the instant case, there is nothing, on the record, that
Amit Ahuja, petitioner, is suffering from any
disability, recognized by the provisions of law. He is
an accused, in the aforesaid complaint. It is he, who is
aggrieved, against the complaint and the summoning
order. It is he, who can challenge the same, on any
ground which may be available to him, under the
provisions of law. If, in criminal cases, until and
unless, a person aggrieved, suffers from some
disability, recognized by law, a stranger or some other
person, is allowed, to fight the proxy war, then the
very purpose of criminal justice system, shall be
defeated. In that event, the Courts, would be
mushroomed, by public interest litigants. In this view
of the matter, the present petition, under Section 482
Cr.P.C., filed by the petitioner, through his attorney, is
not maintainable. On this ground alone, the same is
liable to be dismissed.”
8.   In T.C. Mathai and another Vs. The District & Sessions Judge,
Thiruvananthapuram, Kerala, AIR 1999 SC 1385; in para 15, it is
“15. Section 2 of the Power of Attorney Act cannot
override the specific provision of a statute which
requires that a particular act should be done by a party
in person. When the Code requires the appearance of
an accused in a court it is no compliance with it if a
power of attorney holder appears for him. It is a
different thing that a party can be permitted to appear
through counsel. Chapter XVI of the Code empowers
the Magistrate to issue summons or warrant for the
appearance of the accused. Section 205 of the Code
empowers the Magistrate to dispense with “the
personal attendance of accused, and permit him to
appear by his pleader” if he sees reasons to do so.
Section 273 of the Code speaks of the powers of the
court to record evidence in the presence of the pleader
of the accused, in cases when personal attendance of
the accused is dispensed with. But in no case can the
appearance of the accused be made through a power
of attorney holder. So the contention of the appellant
based on the instrument of power of attorney is of no
avail in this case.”
9.     In the instant case as well the petition has been filed through SPA
holder which is per se not maintainable. Therefore no permission can
be granted to the petitioner to file the present petition bearing No.
CRL.M.C. 1571/2021 under article 227 of the Constitution of India
read with section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure seeking
quashing of FIR No. 258/2010 and the charge-sheet and all the
proceedings arising therefrom including the proceedings initiated
against the petitioner u/s 82/83 of the Code of Criminal Procedure
through his SPA holder. Therefore, I find no ground to accept the
prayer     made    in    the   present  application    bearing      No. Crl.
M.A.10986/2021, the same is, therefore, dismissed, consequently, the
petition bearing No. CRL.M.C. 1571/2021 is also dismissed. All
pending applications (if any) are disposed of.
