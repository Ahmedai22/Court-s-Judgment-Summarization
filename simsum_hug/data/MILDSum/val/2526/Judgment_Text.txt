3       Special Leave Petition (Civil) No 3006 of 2023 arises from an interim order of
the Division Bench of the High Court of Judicature at Bombay dated 7 March 2022. In
Writ Petition (Civil) Nos 95 of 2023 and 142 of 2023 under Article 32 of the
Constitution, the petitioners seek to challenge the validity of a notification dated 19
January 2023 issued by the State of Maharashtra. Special Leave Petition (Civil) Nos
3007 and 3008 of 2023 arise from a judgment of the High Court of Judicature at
Bombay dated 20 January 2023.
4       The Motor Vehicles Act 19881 was amended by Amending Act 32 of 2019, inter
alia, to comprehend aggregators within the scope of its regulatory provisions. The
expression “aggregator” has been defined in Section 2(1A) to mean a digital
intermediary or market place for a passenger to connect with a driver for the purpose
of transportation. Section 93 forms a part of Chapter V which deals with the control of
transport vehicles. Section 93 was also amended in 2019 to cover aggregators.
Section 93, as amended, reads thus:
(i)     as an agent or a canvasser, in the sale of tickets for travel by public service vehicles
or in otherwise soliciting custom for such vehicles, or
(ii)    as an agent in the business of collecting, forwarding or distributing goods carried by
unless he has obtained a licence from such authority and subject to such conditions as may
be prescribed by the State Government.
Provided that while issuing the licence to an aggregator the State Government may follow
such guidelines as may be issued by the Central Government:
Provided further that every aggregator shall comply with the provisions of the Information
Technology Act, 2000 (21 of 2000) and the rules and regulations made there under.”
5       The effect of the amended provision is that no person can act as an aggregator
without a licence. The licence is to be “from such authority and subject to such
conditions as may be prescribed by the State Government”. In terms of the first proviso
to Section 93(1), the State Government, while issuing a licence to an aggregator, “may
follow” the guidelines issued by the Central Government. Section 96 confers a rule
making power on the State Government for implementing the provisions of Chapter
6       Following the amendment of the provisions of the Act in 2019, the Union
Government in the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways formulated the Motor
Vehicle Aggregator Guidelines 2020. The Guidelines commence with a prefatory
statement that they have been issued “as guiding framework for State Government
for issuance of licenses to transport aggregators and for the purposes of regulating
the business conducted by such aggregators”. The guidelines have been issued in
terms of the amended provisions of the statute, including Section 93, which stipulates
that while issuing a licence to an aggregator, the State Government may follow such
guidelines as may be issued by the Central Government. The Guidelines of 2020
contain diverse provisions; among them:
(i)     Clause 4 which deals with the eligibility of an aggregator;
(ii)    Clause 5 which provides conditions for the grant of a licence to an aggregator;
(iii)   Clause 7 which lays down compliances with regard to drivers;
(iv)    Clause 8 which enunciates compliances with regard to vehicles;
(v)     Clause 9 which refers to compliances with regard to aggregators’ apps and
(vi)    Clause 10 which stipulates compliances to ensure safety among other
(vii)   Clause 13 which makes provisions for the regulation of fares.
7       Clause 15 of the Model Guidelines is extracted below:
“15. Aggregatlon of non-transport vehicles by Aggregators:
(1)     ln furtherance of the Central and State Government's objective of reduction in traffic
congestion and automobile pollution, and effective asset utilizations, non-transport vehicle
pooling may be provided by Aggregator unless prohibited by the State Government.
Rationale for such prohibition shalI be specified in writing and accessible on the transport
portal of the State Government.
(2)     ln addition to the compliances mentioned above in these guidelines, as may be
applicable, the following shall be complied with by the Aggregator seeking to aggregate non-
(a)     A maximum of four ride-sharing intra-city trips on a calendar day and a maximum of 2
ride-sharing inter-city trips per week shall be permitted for each vehicle with the driver,
integrated with the Aggregator.
(b)     The vehicle integrated under this Clause 15 shall obtain an insurance of at least Rs. 5
lakhs for the ride-sharers in the vehicle, other than the owner or driver integrated with the
8       Clause 15(1) stipulates that the Central and the State Governments seek to
pursue the objective of reducing traffic congestion and automobile pollution as well as
effective asset utilization. However, clause 15 also stipulates that the pooling of non-
transport vehicles may be provided by the aggregator unless prohibited by the State
Government. The rationale for such a prohibition has to be specified in writing by the
State Government and has to be accessible on its transport portal.
9       Government of Maharashtra has not formulated any rules in relation to
aggregators for the purpose of enforcing the provisions of Chapter V, more
particularly, Section 93(1). The first proviso to Section 93 stipulates that while issuing
a licence to an aggregator, the State Government may follow such guidelines as may
be issued by the Central Government. The Guidelines which have been issued by the
Central Government have a persuasive value. They are not mandatory. When the
State Government formulates rules in pursuance of its power under Section 96, it may
also bear in mind the Guidelines which have been framed by the Union Government
in 2020. Both in terms of the first proviso to Section 93(1) and the plain terms of the
Guidelines, it is evident that while these Guidelines have to be borne in mind, the
ultimate decision is to be arrived at by the State Government while considering
whether to grant a licence and in regard to the formulation of rules in pursuance of the
general rule making power under Section 96.
10      In the present case, the first petitioner in SLP(Civil) No 3007 of 2023 is an
aggregator within the meaning of the amended provisions of the statute. The case
relates to the claim of the petitioners to provide the services of an aggregator for two
wheeler vehicles across the State of Maharashtra. The first petitioner made an
application for the grant of a licence. By an order dated 21 December 2022, the Road
Transport Officer at Pune2, rejected the application on the ground that it did not comply
with various terms and conditions of the Guidelines of 2020. The relevant part of the
order of the RTO is extracted below:

11      The petitioners instituted a writ petition before the High Court of Judicature at
Bombay in order to challenge the legality of the decision of the RTO. During the course
of the hearing, the High Court was apprised of the fact that on 19 January 2023, the
State Government had issued a notification bearing on the issue.
12      The notification issued by the State Government on 19 January 2023 is
extracted in its entirety below:
Whereas, the Government of India has, vide Ministry of Road Transport and Highways
(Transport), Letter No. F. No. 1601119/2019-T, dated the 27th November 2020, issued the
Motor Vehicle Aggregator Guidelines, 2020 (hereinafter referred to as "the said Guidelines"),
under the proviso to sub-section (1) of section 93 of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 (59 of
And whereas, clauses 11 and 15 of the said Guidelines provides for ride pooling and
aggregation of nontransport vehicles by aggregators, respectively. Subclause (1) of said
clause 15 empowers the State Government to provide 'Rationale' for prohibition of
nontransport vehicles pooling by aggregators;
And whereas, it is observed that, use of non-transport vehicles (including two wheelers, three
wheelers and four wheelers) as transport vehicles is on the rise enormously and raises
serious practical and security concerns of the passengers and which may cause serious
threat to the road safety of general public and passengers, at large;
And whereas, the number of vehicles registered in the non-transport category is very large,
therefore the nontransport vehicles registered outside the State of Maharashtra may also be
used for the purpose of vehicle aggregation and may affect the economic viability of the
vehicles operating on valid permits in the State of Maharashtra;
And whereas, the issue of whether non-transport vehicles can be permitted to be used as
transport vehicles, including for aggregation and ride pooling thereof requires detailed
consideration regarding terms and conditions, framework and guidelines thereof. Therefore,
the State Government has constituted the committee to study the said issues and to give
And whereas, the Government considers it expedient to prohibit the pooling of non-transport
vehicles by aggregators in order to ensure road safety of the general public and passengers
at large in the State of Maharashtra;
Now, therefore, the Government of Maharashtra, in pursuance of clause 15 of the Motor
Vehicle Aggregator Guidelines, 2020, hereby prohibits the use of nontransport vehicles
(including two wheelers, three wheelers and four wheelers) for the purposes of aggregation
and ride -pooling thereof.
13     By the above decision, the State Government has noted that the issue of
whether non-transport vehicles ought to be permitted to be used as transport vehicles
including for aggregation and ride pooling requires consideration. A Committee was
constituted by the State Government on 12 January 2023. Pending the decision of the
Committee, the State Government has prohibited the pooling of non-transport vehicles
by aggregators “in order to ensure road safety of the general public and passengers
at large” in the State of Maharashtra. The Committee which has been constituted by
the State Government on 12 January 2023 is chaired by a former IAS officer
consisting, inter alia, of the Additional Director General of Police and representatives
of the Transport Department and the Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation.
14     The High Court adjudicated upon the challenge to the order of the RTO dated
21 December 2022. The High Court recorded that counsel appearing on behalf of the
petitioners informed the Court that they would consider whether or not to challenge
the notification dated 19 January 2023 separately and at that stage, the challenge was
confined to the order of 21 December 2022 issued by the RTO. The High Court has
also proceeded to observe that the Guidelines of 2020 leave a certain degree of
latitude to the State Government and there is no policy of the State Government at the
present point on the basis of which the petitioners would have an unrestricted right to
obtain a licence.
15     Mr Mukul Rohatgi, senior counsel appearing on behalf of the petitioners,
submitted that many of the requirements of the Guidelines of 2020 on the basis of
which the application for a licence was rejected are unworkable. This has been
seriously in contest since Mr Tushar Mehta, Solicitor General appearing on behalf of
the State of Maharashtra, has urged that the Central Guidelines are intended to
ensure, above all, the safety of the passengers and drivers for which purpose certain
requirements have been introduced.
16     The correctness of the order of the RTO rejecting the application for a licence
on 21 December 2022 is now overshadowed by the subsequent decision of the State
Government arising out of its notification dated 19 January 2023. The State
Government has categorically taken a decision that the issue as to whether non-
transport vehicles should be permitted to be used as transport vehicles including for
aggregation and ride pooling merits detailed consideration. Pending the decision of
the Committee, the State Government has taken a decision to prohibit the use of non-
transport vehicles for the purpose of aggregation.
17     There was no challenge before the High Court to the notification dated 19
January 2023. Two petitions have now been instituted before this Court under Article
32 of the Constitution for the purpose of challenging the notification of the State
Government. We are not inclined to entertain the challenge to the notification dated
19 January 2023 of the Home Department of the State Government in proceedings
under Article 32 of the Constitution. The petitioners would be at liberty to pursue the
alternate remedy under Article 226 of the Constitution before the High Court. The
correctness of the order of the RTO dated 21 December 2022 stands subsumed by
the decision which has been taken by the High Court to entrust the examination of the
entire issue by the Committee, before it decides on the use of non-transport vehicles
for the purposes of aggregation and ride pooling.
18     During the course of the hearing, Mr Mukul Rohatgi submitted that while, on the
one hand, the observations in paragraph 57 of the impugned judgment of the High
Court reserve liberty to the petitioners to challenge the notification dated 19 January
2023, the observations in a subsequent part of the judgment, namely, paragraph 59
would preclude such a challenge.
19     In order to allay the above grievance, it needs to be clarified that while
considering a challenge to the notification dated 19 January 2023, the High Court shall
not consider itself bound by its observations in paragraph 59. At any rate, the latter
observations are only in the context of the challenge to the decision of the RTO dated
21 December 2022 which alone was a subject matter of the proceedings before the
20     In the above backdrop, we grant liberty to the petitioners to move the High Court
under Article 226 of the Constitution for the purpose of challenging the notification of
the State Government dated 19 January 2023. The High Court shall consider any such
challenge uninfluenced by the observations contained in the impugned judgment and
order dated 20 January 2023.
21     The order of the RTO dated 21 December 2022 indicates that it has been
passed on the ground that the provisions of the Guidelines of 2020 were not complied
with. Once the State Government takes a final decision on the submission of the report
of the Committee, the petitioners would be entitled to pursue their legal remedies after
complying with such terms and conditions as may be prescribed in the decision of the
State Government. The State Government shall take a final decision on or before 31
March 2023. The Committee shall take its final decision on or before 15 March 2023
so as to leave time to the State Government to take a considered decision by the end
23     Pending applications, including application for intervention, stand disposed of.
