As these transfer petitions are between the
husband and wife in connection with the disputes
arising out of their marriage, they have been disposed
of by this common order.
2. Tr.P(C) No.305/2019 is filed by the husband
against the wife, to transfer O.P.No.304/2019 filed by
the wife, from the Family Court, Thalasseri to the
Family Court, Ottappalam; Tr.P(C) No.468/2021 is
filed by the wife against the husband to transfer O.P.
(G&W) No.357/2019, filed by the husband, from the
Family    Court,  Ottappalam     to  the  Family  Court,
Thalasseri and Tr.(PC) No.431/2022 is filed by the
husband to transfer O.P.No.508/2022 filed by the wife
from the Family Court, Thalassery to the Family Court,
Ottappalam. The parties and the pleadings are, for the
sake   of   convenience,   referred   to  as in  Tr.P(C)
No.431/2022, which is treated as the leading case and
is the recent case.
3. The case of the petitioner-husband in brief in
Tr.P(C) No.431/2022 is that the respondent is his wife.
They were married on 16.04.2012. They have a
daughter named Evangelin Joseph, who is now 9 years
of age. The respondent has filed O.P.No.508/2022
against   the    petitioner, before  the   Family    court,
Thalassery, for a decree of divorce. The petitioner has
filed O.P.No.357/2019 against the respondent, before
the Family Court, Ottappalam, for an order for the
permanent custody of their daughter. The respondent
has filed O.P.No.304/2017       against   the   petitioner,
before the Family Court, Thalassery, for an order for
the permanent custody of the child. Then, the
petitioner   filed   Tr.P(C) No.305/2019,     to  transfer
O.P.No.304/2019 from the Family Court, Thalassery to
the Family Court, Ottappalam. Later, the respondent
filed Tr.P(C) No.468/2021 to transfer O.P.No.357/2019
from the Family Court, Ottappalam to the Family
Court, Thalassery. During the pendency of the above
transfer   petitions,  the  Family    Court,  Thalassery,
passed an interim order directing the interim custody
of the child to be given to the respondent. The
petitioner challenged the said order before this Court
in OP(FC) No.404/2019. The parties were referred to
mediation    and    they   entered   into   Annexure   B
agreement, whereby the interim custody of the child
was given to the petitioner. The respondent is
employed abroad. She visits India only on her annual
leave. The parties have agreed that custody of the
child be given to the respondent during the child's
school holidays. After entering into Annexure B
agreement, the respondent went abroad. She left
India in 2019 and returned only after three years. It is
learnt that the respondent would return to New
Zealand in August 2022. She is prosecuting all the
proceedings through her power of attorney holder.
Therefore, no inconvenience would be caused to the
respondent, if O.P.Nos.304/2019 and 508/2022 are
transferred from the Family Court, Thalassery to the
Nos.305/2019 and 431/2022 may be allowed.
4.   The    respondent-wife     has    filed   Tr.P(C)
No.468/2021     and   a   counter   affidavit   in  Tr.P(C)
No.431/2022,     inter-alia,   admitting    that   she   is
employed in New Zealand. She has returned to India
on 07.06.2022 and filed O.P.No.508/2022 before the
Family Court, Thalassery. The parties were referred
for   mediation    and    the   respondent      herself  is
prosecuting the proceedings. The sole intention of the
petitioner is to keep away the daughter from the
respondent. It would be difficult for the respondent to
travel all the way from Kannur to Ottappalam, if the
proceedings     are   transferred.    Therefore,  Tr.P(C)
Nos.305/2019 and 431/2022 may be dismissed and
Tr.P(C) No.468/2021 may be allowed.
5. Heard; Sri. Dheeraj Rajan, the learned counsel
appearing      for     the     petitioner-husband     and
Sri.K.Mohanakannan, the learned counsel appearing
for the respondent -wife.
6. The point is which of the transfer petitions are
to be allowed.
7. Admittedly, the respondent-wife is employed in
New Zealand. She has filed O.P.No.508/2022 before
the Family Court, Thalassery and Tr.P(C) No.468/2021
before this Court through her power of attorney
holder. It is evident from Annexure B proceeding that
the custody of the 9 year old daughter of the couple is
given to the petitioner-husband. O.P.No.304/2019 and
OP(G&W) No.357/2019 are filed by the wife and
husband, respectively, for the custody of the child. The
child is a permanent resident of Palakkad. As O.P.
Nos.304/2019 and 357/2019 are filed under the
Guardian and Wards Act, 1890, necessarily the child
will have to be produced before the Court below, to
comply with the direction regarding the interim
custody orders agreed in Annexure B proceeding.
Therefore, I am of the view that it is the convenience
of the child that has to be given preference and
8.  Moreover,     since   the   respondent-wife   is
employed in New Zealand and going by the law laid
down by this Court in Mini Antony vs. Savio Aruja
[2022 (3) KHC 442], the inconvenience of the power of
attorney holder, cannot be taken as a ground to order
transfer of a case. Hence, I am inclined to exercise the
discretionary powers of this Court under Section 24 of
the   Code    of Civil   Procedure    and   allow Tr.P(C)
Nos.305/2019 and 431/2022. Furthermore, if all the
proceedings are tried by the same Court, it would save
precious judicial time and avoid conflict of decisions.
Nonetheless, the respondent -wife would be at liberty
to move the Family Court, Ottapalam and seek for the
dispensation of her personal appearance and also
avail the video conferencing facility.
In the result, I pass the following orders:
(i)     Tr.P(C) No.305/2019 is allowed by ordering
withdrawal of O.P.No.304/2019 from the Family
Court, Thalassery and transferring it to the
(ii)    Tr.P(C) No.431/2022 is allowed by ordering
withdrawal of O.P.No.508/2022 from the Family
Court,    Thalassery    and  ordering  it  to  be
transferred to the Family Court, Ottappalam.
(iii)  Tr.P(C) No.468/2021 is dismissed.
(iv)   The parties would be at liberty to move the
Family Court, Ottappalam and seek for the
consolidation and joint trial of all the cases
between them.
(v)    The respondent-wife would be at liberty to
move the Family Court, Ottappalam and seek
for dispensation of her personal appearance
and to avail the video conferencing facility.
(vi)   The Registry shall forward a copy of this order
to    the   Family    Court,    Thalassery    with
instructions to forthwith transmit the records
in O.P.No.304/2019 and 508/2022 to the Family
(vii)   The     Family    Court,    Ottappalam,    shall
immediately on receipt of the records in the
above numbered cases, post the cases along
with OP(G&W) No.357/2019.
(viii)  The interim custody arrangement agreed by
the parties in Annexure B agreement shall
continue to remain in force until it is modified
or varied.
