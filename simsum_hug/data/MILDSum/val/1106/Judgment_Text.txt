4.         FSL Report not part of the Charge      18 - 21
1.     The present Revision Petition has been filed, to set aside the
order dated 05.05.2022, passed by the Learned Trial Court, North
District, Rohini Courts, Delhi, wherein Default Bail of the Petitioner,
under Section 167(2) Cr.P.C. was dismissed by the learned Trial
2.     The brief facts leading to the present petition are as under:
a) The Petitioner is in custody in case FIR no. 96/2021 under
Sections 21 and 29 of the Narcotics Drugs and Psychotropic
Substances Act, 1985 (hereinafter “NDPS Act”) registered at
P.S. Narela Industrial Area. On completion of the investigation,
the charge sheet was filed on 03.03.2021 without the Forensic
Science Laboratory (FSL) report. The charge sheet already filed
mentioned that the supplementary charge sheet would be filed
on the receipt of the report from forensic laboratory. The
Petitioner was arrested on 04.03.2021, wherein he was found in
possession of 300 gms of Heroine and 06 gms of heroine was
recovered from the co-accused.
b) The Petitioner filed an application for bail in default under
Section 167(2) of the Cr.P.C. before the learned Trial Court,
claiming that the complete charge sheet was not filed within the
stipulated time frame under Section 36A (4) of the NDPS Act.
The learned Trial Court observed that the accused would not be
entitled to Default Bail as the charge sheet has been filed even
though the FSL Report is not filed. In furtherance, it was
observed by the learned Trial Court that the quantity recovered
from the Petition would fall under the bar of commercial
quantity. Thus, the onus would be upon the Petitioner to satisfy
the learned Trial Court. The observations made read as under:-
“…The plea of default bail as the charge-sheet has been
admittedly filed within a period of 180 days of the remand,
but the same is without FSL result of the seized contraband.
The said issue is already settled by Hon'ble Delhi High
Court in case titled Krishan Lal V. State, 39(1989) DLT 392
and MohdArbaz vs State Cr Rev no. 1219/2019 dated
03.11.2020. The said issue though is now pending qua NDPS
Act cases before the Hon'ble Supreme Court and therefore,
till that time, the proposition of law as laid by Hon'ble Delhi
High Court in Krishan Lal (supra) case holds field.
The amount of quantity recovered from the
accused/applicant falls under the category of commercial
quantity and bar under 37 of the NDPS Act is also
applicable. Therefore, the onus is upon the applicant to
satisfy the twin conditions imposed as mandated in judgment
viz; Union of India through NCB Lucknow V. Nawaz Khan,
The judgments relied upon by Ld. Counsel for the
accused/applicant are not applicable to the present case
being distinguishable on facts. In view of the above facts and
circumstances of the case, I am of the considered view that
no ground is made out for grant of bail to accused/applicant.
Therefore, the application moved on behalf of the
accused/applicant stands dismissed…”
Submissions of Learned Counsels
3.     It is stated by the learned Counsel for the petitioner that the
charge sheet is incomplete without FSL Report, since the IO does not
know whether the substance recovered is actually a banned substance
under Sections 21 and 29 of the NDPS Act.
4.     Ld. Counsel for the APP for State states that the question of
whether the charge sheet is incomplete without FSL Report or not, is
yet to be decided by the Hon’ble Supreme Court and therefore the
reliance should be placed on the law presently laid down by the
Division Bench of this Court in Kishan Lal vs State 1989 SCC
OnLine Del 348 and the Coordinate Bench of this Court in Babu vs
The State (Govt. Of NCT of Delhi) BAIL APPLN. 2075/2020 and
Mohd. Arbaz vs State of NCT of Delhi CRL. REV. P. 1219/2019.
The cases above mentioned have held that the FSL Report shall not
form part of the charge sheet and hence, the plea for grant of bail in
default was dismissed.
5.     The procedure for application of Default bail finds its roots in
Section 167(2) of the Cr.P.C. It is imperative to understand the
objective and relevance of the provision of Section 167 for
adjudication of the issue in hand. It is trite law that Default Bail under
Section 167 can only be availed before the filing of the charge sheet.
The period for the calculation of the number of days of detention
would commence from the date of remand of the accused and not
from the date of arrest. (reference from Ravi Prakash Singh vs State
of Bihar, (2015) 8 SCC 340). The period could be perused from the
Custody              Maximum Number of Days
6.     It has been repeatedly emphasized by various courts that the
right to seek default bail is an indefeasible right provided to the
accused. The object of the Default Bail is inherently linked to Article
21 of the Constitution of India, laying emphasis on safeguarding the
life and personal liberty of the accused against arbitrary detention.
Section 167 states: -
“…167. Procedure when investigation cannot be completed in
twenty-four hours.—
(1) Whenever any person is arrested and detained in
custody, and it appears that the investigation cannot be
completed within the period of twenty-four hours fixed by
section 57, and there are grounds for believing that the
accusation or information is wellfounded, the officer in
charge of the police station or the police officer making the
investigation, if he is not below the rank of sub-inspector,
shall forthwith transmit to the nearest Judicial Magistrate a
copy of the entries in the diary hereinafter prescribed
relating to the case, and shall at the same time forward the
accused to such Magistrate.
(2) The Magistrate to whom an accused person is forwarded
under this section may, whether he has or has not
jurisdiction to try the case, from time to time, authorise the
detention of the accused in such custody as such Magistrate
thinks fit, for a term not exceeding fifteen days in the whole;
and if he has no jurisdiction to try the case or commit it for
trial, and considers further detention unnecessary, he may
order the accused to be forwarded to a Magistrate having
such jurisdiction: Provided that—
1 [(a) the Magistrate may authorise the detention of the
accused person, otherwise than in custody of the police,
beyond the period of fifteen days, if he is satisfied that
adequate grounds exist for doing so, but no Magistrate shall
authorise the detention of the accused person in custody
under this paragraph for a total period exceeding—
(i)     ninety days, where the investigation relates to
an     offence     punishable     with     death,
imprisonment for life or imprisonment for a
term of not less than ten years;
(ii) sixty days, where the investigation relates to
any other offence, and, on the expiry of the
said period of ninety days, or sixty days, as the
case may be, the accused person shall be
released on bail if he is prepared to and does
furnish bail, and every person released on bail
under this sub-section shall be deemed to be so
released under the provisions of Chapter
XXXIII for the purposes of that Chapter;]
2 [(b) no Magistrate shall authorise detention
of the accused in custody of the police under
this section unless the accused is produced
before him in person for the first time and
subsequently every time till the accused
remains in the custody of the police, but the
Magistrate may extend further detention in
judicial custody on production of the accused
either in person or through the medium of
electronic video linkage;]
(c) no Magistrate of the second class, not
specially empowered in this behalf by the High
Court, shall authorise detention in the custody
[Explanation I.—For the avoidance of doubts,
it is hereby declared that, notwithstanding the
expiry of the period specified in paragraph (a),
the accused shall be detained in custody so
long as he does not furnish bail.]
4 [Explanation II.—If any question arises
whether an accused person was produced
before the Magistrate as required under clause
(b), the production of the accused person may
be proved by his signature on the order
authorising detention or by the order certified
by the Magistrate as to production of the
accused person through the medium of
electronic video linkage, as the case may be.]
1 [Provided further that in case of a woman under eighteen
years of age, the detention shall be authorised to be in the
custody of a remand home or recognised social institution.]
2 [(2A) Notwithstanding anything contained in sub-section
(1) or sub-section (2), the officer in charge of the police
station or the police officer making the investigation, if he is
not below the rank of a sub-inspector, may, where a Judicial
Magistrate is not available, transmit to the nearest Executive
Magistrate, on whom the powers of a Judicial Magistrate or
Metropolitan Magistrate have been conferred, a copy of the
entry in the diary hereinafter prescribed relating to the case,
and shall, at the same time, forward the accused to such
Executive Magistrate, and thereupon such Executive
Magistrate, may, for reasons to be recorded in writing,
authorise the detention of the accused person in such
custody as he may think fit for a term not exceeding seven
days in the aggregate; and, on the expiry of the period of
detention so authorised, the accused person shall be
released on bail except where an order for further detention
of the accused person has been made by a Magistrate
competent to make such order; and, where no order for such
further detention is made, the period during which the
accused person was detained in custody under the orders
made by an Executive Magistrate under this sub-section,
shall be taken into account in computing the period specified
in paragraph (a) of the proviso to sub-section (2): Provided
that before the expiry of the period aforesaid, the Executive
Magistrate shall transmit to the nearest Judicial Magistrate
the records of the case together with a copy of the entries in
the diary relating to the case which was transmitted to him
by the officer in charge of the police station or the police
officer making the investigation, as the case may be.]
(3) A Magistrate authorising under this section
detention in the custody of the police shall
record his reasons for so doing.
(4) Any Magistrate other than the Chief
Judicial Magistrate making such order shall
forward a copy of his order, with his reasons
for making it, to the Chief Judicial Magistrate.
(5) If in any case triable by a Magistrate as a
summons-case, the investigation is not
concluded within a period of six months from
the date on which the accused was arrested, the
Magistrate shall make an order stopping
further investigation into the offence unless the
officer making the investigation satisfies the
Magistrate that for special reasons and in the
interests of justice the continuation of the
investigation beyond the period of six months is
necessary.
(6) Where any order stopping further
investigation into an offence has been made
under sub-section (5), the Sessions Judge may,
if he is satisfied, on an application made to him
or otherwise, that further investigation into the
offence ought to be made, vacate the order
made under sub-section (5) and direct further
investigation to be made into the offence
subject to such directions with regard to bail
and other matters as he may specify…”
7.      In Sanjay Dutt vs State through CBI, Bombay (II), (1994) 5
SCC 410, the Constitution Bench of the Hon’ble Supreme Court held
that the indefeasible right of the accused to be released on bail for not
filing the charge sheet within the statutory period is enforceable by the
accused only till the filing of the challan. Further, if an accused does
not avail Default Bail, they can always seek Regular Bail under
Cr.P.C.. The observation reads as under :-
“48. We have no doubt that the common stance before us of
the nature of indefeasible right of the accused to be released
on bail by virtue of Section 20(4)(bb) is based on a correct
reading of the principle indicated in that decision. The
indefeasible right accruing to the accused in such a situation
is enforceable only prior to the filing of the challan and it
does not survive or remain enforceable on the challan being
filed, if already not availed of. Once the challan has been
filed, the question of grant of bail has to be considered and
decided only with reference to the merits of the case under
the provisions relating to grant of bail to an accused after
the filing of the challan. The custody of the accused after the
challan has been filed is not governed by Section 167 but
different provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure. If
that right had accrued to the accused but it remained
unenforced till the filing of the challan, then there is no
question of its enforcement thereafter since it is extinguished
the moment challan is filed because Section 167 CrPC
ceases to apply. The Division Bench also indicated that if
there be such an application of the accused for release on
bail and also a prayer for extension of time to complete the
investigation according to the proviso in Section 20(4)(bb),
both of them should be considered together. It is obvious that
no bail can be given even in such a case unless the prayer
for extension of the period is rejected. In short, the grant of
bail in such a situation is also subject to refusal of the
prayer for extension of time, if such a prayer is made. If the
accused applies for bail under this provision on expiry of the
period of 180 days or the extended period, as the case may
be, then he has to be released on bail forthwith. The
accused, so released on bail may be arrested and committed
to custody according to the provisions of the Code of
Criminal Procedure. It is settled by Constitution Bench
decisions that a petition seeking the writ of habeas corpus on
the ground of absence of a valid order of remand or
detention of the accused, has to be dismissed, if on the date
of return of the rule, the custody or detention is on the basis
of a valid order. (See Naranjan Singh Nathawan v. State of
656] ; Ram Narayan Singh v. State of Delhi [1953 SCR 652 :
AIR 1953 SC 277 : 1953 Cri LJ 1113] and A.K. Gopalan v.
Government of India [(1966) 2 SCR 427 : AIR 1966 SC 816
8.     In a recent judgement of the Hon’ble Supreme Court, M.
Ravindran vs The Intelligence Officer, Directorate of Revenue
Intelligence (2021) 2 SCC 485, the Three-Judge Bench looked into
the trajectory of Section 167(2) and the relation of the provision
within the Constitutional parlance. The Hon’ble Supreme Court made
the following observations: -
“… II. Section 167(2) and the Fundamental Right to Life and
17. Before we proceed to expand upon the parameters of the
right to default bail under Section 167(2) as interpreted by
various decisions of this Court, we find it pertinent to note
the observations made by this Court in Uday Mohanlal
Acharya [Uday Mohanlal Acharya v. State of Maharashtra,
(2001) 5 SCC 453 : 2001 SCC (Cri) 760] on the fundamental
right to personal liberty of the person and the effect of
deprivation of the same as follows: (SCC p. 472, para 13)
“13. … Personal liberty is one of the cherished
objects of the Indian Constitution and
deprivation of the same can only be in
accordance with law and in conformity with the
provisions thereof, as stipulated under Article
21 of the Constitution. When the law provides
that the Magistrate could authorise the
detention of the accused in custody up to a
maximum period as indicated in the proviso to
sub-section (2) of Section 167, any further
detention beyond the period without filing of a
challan by the investigating agency would be a
subterfuge and would not be in accordance
with law and in conformity with the provisions
of the Criminal Procedure Code, and as such,
could be violative of Article 21 of the
17.1. Article 21 of the Constitution of India provides that
“no person shall be deprived of his life or personal liberty
except according to procedure established by law”. It has
been settled by a Constitution Bench of this Court in Maneka
Gandhi v. Union of India [Maneka Gandhi v. Union of India,
(1978) 1 SCC 248] , that such a procedure cannot be
arbitrary, unfair or unreasonable. The history of the
enactment of Section 167(2) CrPC and the safeguard of
“default bail” contained in the proviso thereto is
intrinsically linked to Article 21 and is nothing but a
legislative exposition of the constitutional safeguard that no
person shall be detained except in accordance with rule of
17.2. Under Section 167 of the Code of Criminal Procedure,
1898 (“the 1898 Code”) which was in force prior to the
enactment of the CrPC, the maximum period for which an
accused could be remanded to custody, either police or
judicial, was 15 days. However, since it was often
unworkable to conclude complicated investigations within
15 days, a practice arose wherein investigating officers
would file “preliminary charge-sheets” after the expiry of
the remand period. The State would then request the
Magistrate to postpone commencement of the trial and
authorise further remand of the accused under Section 344
of the 1898 Code till the time the investigation was
completed and the final charge-sheet was filed. The Law
Commission of India in Report No. 14 on Reforms of the
Judicial Administration (Vol. II, 1948, pp. 758-760) pointed
out that in many cases the accused were languishing for
several months in custody without any final report being
filed before the courts. It was also pointed out that there was
conflict in judicial opinion as to whether the Magistrate was
bound to release the accused if the police report was not
filed within 15 days.
17.3. Hence the Law Commission in Report No. 14
recommended the need for an appropriate provision
specifically providing for continued remand after the expiry
of 15 days, in a manner that “while meeting the needs of a
full and proper investigation in cases of serious crime, will
still safeguard the liberty of the person of the individual”.
Further, that the legislature should prescribe a maximum
time period beyond which no accused could be detained
without filing of the police report before the Magistrate. It
was pointed out that in England, even a person accused of
grave offences such as treason could not be indefinitely
detained in prison till commencement of the trial.
17.4. The suggestion made in Report No. 14 was reiterated
by the Law Commission in Report No. 41 on The Code of
Criminal Procedure, 1898 (Vol. I, 1969, pp. 76-77). The Law
Commission re-emphasised the need to guard against the
misuse of Section 344 of the 1898 Code by filing
“preliminary reports” for remanding the accused beyond the
statutory period prescribed under Section 167. It was
pointed out that this could lead to serious abuse wherein
“the arrested person can in this manner be kept in custody
indefinitely while the investigation can go on in a leisurely
manner”. Hence the Commission recommended fixing of a
maximum time-limit of 60 days for remand. The Commission
considered the reservation expressed earlier in Report No.
37 that such an extension may result in the 60-day period
becoming a matter of routine. However, faith was expressed
that proper supervision by the superior courts would help
circumvent the same.
17.5. The suggestions made in Report No. 41 were taken
note of and incorporated by the Central Government while
drafting the Code of Criminal Procedure Bill in 1970.
Ultimately, the 1898 Code was replaced by the present
CrPC. The Statement of Objects and Reasons of the CrPC
provides that the Government took the following important
considerations into account while evaluating the
recommendations of the Law Commission:
“3. The recommendations of the Commission
were examined carefully by the Government,
keeping in view, among others, the following
basic considerations:
(i) an accused person should get a fair trial in
accordance with the accepted principles of
natural justice;
(ii) every effort should be made to avoid delay
in investigation and trial which is harmful not
only to the individuals involved but also to
(iii) the procedure should not be complicated
and should, to the utmost extent possible,
ensure fair deal to the poorer sections of the
community.”
17.6. It was in this backdrop that Section 167(2) was enacted
within the present day CrPC, providing for time-limits on the
period of remand of the accused, proportionate to the
seriousness of the offence committed, failing which the
accused acquires the indefeasible right to bail. As is evident
from the recommendations of the Law Commission
mentioned supra, the intent of the legislature was to balance
the need for sufficient time-limits to complete the
investigation with the need to protect the civil liberties of the
accused. Section 167(2) provides for a clear mandate that
the investigative agency must collect the required evidence
within the prescribed time period, failing which the accused
can no longer be detained. This ensures that the
investigating officers are compelled to act swiftly and
efficiently without misusing the prospect of further remand.
This also ensures that the court takes cognizance of the case
without any undue delay from the date of giving information
of the offence, so that society at large does not lose faith and
develop cynicism towards the criminal justice system.
17.7. Therefore, as mentioned supra, Section 167(2) is
integrally linked to the constitutional commitment under
Article 21 promising protection of life and personal liberty
against unlawful and arbitrary detention, and must be
interpreted in a manner which serves this purpose. In this
regard we find it useful to refer to the decision of the three-
Judge Bench of this Court in Rakesh Kumar Paul v. State of
Assam [Rakesh Kumar Paul v. State of Assam, (2017) 15
SCC 67 : (2018) 1 SCC (Cri) 401] , which laid down certain
seminal principles as to the interpretation of Section 167(2)
CrPC though the questions of law involved were somewhat
different from the present case. The questions before the
three-Judge Bench in Rakesh Kumar Paul [Rakesh Kumar
Paul v. State of Assam, (2017) 15 SCC 67 : (2018) 1 SCC
(Cri) 401] were whether, firstly, the 90-day remand
extension under Section 167(2)(a)(i) would be applicable in
respect of offences where the maximum period of
imprisonment was 10 years, though the minimum period was
less than 10 years. Secondly, whether the application for bail
filed by the accused could be construed as an application for
default bail, even though the expiry of the statutory period
under Section 167(2) had not been specifically pleaded as a
ground for bail. The majority opinion held that the 90-day
limit is only available in respect of offences where a
minimum ten year' imprisonment period is stipulated, and
that the oral arguments for default bail made by the counsel
for the accused before the High Court would suffice in lieu
of a written application. This was based on the reasoning
that the court should not be too technical in matters of
personal liberty. Madan B. Lokur, J. in his majority opinion,
pertinently observed as follows: (SCC pp. 95-96 & 99, paras
“29. Notwithstanding this, the basic legislative
intent of completing investigations within
twenty-four hours and also within an otherwise
time-bound period remains unchanged, even
though that period has been extended over the
years. This is an indication that in addition to
giving     adequate     time     to    complete
investigations, the legislature has also and
always put a premium on personal liberty and
has always felt that it would be unfair to an
accused to remain in custody for a prolonged
or indefinite period. It is for this reason and
also to hold the investigating agency
accountable that time-limits have been laid
down by the legislature. …
prolonged period have prompted the legislature
for more than a century to ensure expeditious
conclusion of investigations so that an accused
person is not unnecessarily deprived of his or
her personal liberty by remaining in prolonged
custody for an offence that he or she might not
even have committed. In our opinion, the entire
debate before us must also be looked at from
the point of view of expeditious conclusion of
investigations and from the angle of personal
liberty and not from a purely dictionary or
textual perspective as canvassed by the learned
counsel for the State.
41. We take this view keeping in mind that in
matters of personal liberty and Article 21 of the
Constitution, it is not always advisable to be
formalistic or technical. The history of the
personal liberty jurisprudence of this Court and
other constitutional courts includes petitions
for a writ of habeas corpus and for other writs
being entertained even on the basis of a letter
addressed to the Chief Justice or the Court.”
(emphasis supplied)
Therefore, the courts cannot adopt a rigid or formalistic
approach whilst considering any issue that touches upon the
rights contained in Article 21.
17.8. We may also refer with benefit to the recent judgment
of this Court in S. Kasi v. State [S. Kasi v. State, (2021) 12
SCC 1 : 2020 SCC OnLine SC 529] , wherein it was
observed that the indefeasible right to default bail under
Section 167(2) is an integral part of the right to personal
liberty under Article 21, and the said right to bail cannot be
suspended even during a pandemic situation as is prevailing
currently. It was emphasised that the right of the accused to
be set at liberty takes precedence over the right of the State
to carry on the investigation and submit a charge-sheet.
17.9. Additionally, it is well-settled that in case of any
ambiguity in the construction of a penal statute, the courts
must favour the interpretation which leans towards
protecting the rights of the accused, given the ubiquitous
power disparity between the individual accused and the
State machinery. This is applicable not only in the case of
substantive penal statutes but also in the case of procedures
providing for the curtailment of the liberty of the accused.
17.10. With respect to the CrPC particularly, the Statement
of Objects and Reasons (supra) is an important aid of
construction. Section 167(2) has to be interpreted keeping in
mind the threefold objectives expressed by the legislature,
namely, ensuring a fair trial, expeditious investigation and
trial, and setting down a rationalised procedure that protects
the interests of indigent sections of society. These objects are
nothing but subsets of the overarching fundamental right
guaranteed under Article 21.
17.11. Hence, it is from the perspective of upholding the
fundamental right to life and personal liberty under Article
21 that we shall clarify and reconcile the various judicial
interpretations of Section 167(2) for the purpose of resolving
the dilemma that has arisen in the present case.”
9.    In the present case, the charge sheet was filed on 03.03.2021,
however, without the FSL report. The charge sheet was thus filed
within the limitation period prescribed under law. The question in
dispute narrows down as to whether the FSL report forms part of the
charge sheet and is an essential prerequisite to file with the charge
sheet.
FSL Report not part of the Charge Sheet
10.    In Kishan Lal vs State 1989 SCC OnLine Del 348, a Division
Bench of this Court observed that a police report does not need to
enclose an expert opinion of Government Scientific expert with the
charge sheet and thus, no bail was granted under Section 167(2) as the
charge sheet was already filed within stipulated time. The observation
reads as follows:-
“… 5. The question raised by the petitioners in a nut shell is
whether the investigation of a case under the NDPS Act can
be said to be complete in the absence of the report of the
Scientific Officer and Chemical Examiner? The contention is
that where the accused person is allegedly found in
possession of or transporting a prohibited drug or
substance, mainly two facts have to be established by the
prosecution viz., (1) that of recovery of the commodity or
substance and (2) that the possession of the said recovered
material is illegal under the provisions of the NDPS Act. It is
submitted that the Investigating Officer would be unable to
give his opinion regarding the second aspect till he obtains
the report of the expert and, therefore, the report submitted
by the Investigating Officer even if purported to be under
Section 173(2) of the Code, must be held, to be based on in
complete investigation.
6. The learned Single Judge in his reference order has
noticed that the reported cases in which this question has
been settled related to offences under the Penal Code, 1860.
It was urged before him that the principles enunciated in
those cases are not applicable to cases involving an offence
under the NDPS Act or the old Opium Act or the Excise Act.
To appreciate the contentions raised in these petitions, we
have to notice the case law to some extent to highlight the
settled principles.
7. It has been held by the Supreme Court that although the
police are not permitted to send an incomplete report under
Section 173(2) of the Code, yet the investigation except for
the report of an expert like the Serologist or Scientific
Officer and Chemical Examiner is complete and, therefore,
the Magistrate is empowered to take cognizance of the
offence on a police report which does not include the
expert's opinion. In Tara Singh v. State, AIR 1951 SC 441,
(1) the Polka had infact filed a report dated the 2nd October,
1949 terming it as an “incomplete challan”, and on the 5th
October they filed a report which they called a “complete
challan”. Thereafter on the 19th October they filed yet
another report which was termed as “supplementary
challan”. The objection taken at the trial was that the
Magistrate had no power to take cognizance of the case on
3rd October when the incomplete challan dated 2nd
October, 1949 was placed before him. It was contended that
the Police are not permitted to file an incomplete report
under Section 173(2) of the Code.”
11.    Further in view of the decision of Kishan Lal vs State (supra), a
Coordinate Bench of this Court in a recent judgement of Babu vs The
State (Govt. Of NCT of Delhi) BAIL APPLN. 2075/2020 dated
25.09.2020, observed as under: -
“…18. Though this Court is of the view that the decision of
the Division Bench of the Punjab and Haryana High Court
is an appropriate opinion in relation to cognizance of an
offence under NDPS Act without the FSL report being an
illegality, however, bound by the Division Bench decision of
this Court, judicial discipline mandates this Court to follow
the same. Consequently, in view of the decision of the
Division Bench of this Court in Kishan Lal vs. State (supra),
it is held that the petitioner is not entitled to grant of bail
under Section 167(2) CrPC for non-filing of the FSL report
along with the charge sheet…”
12.     A similar view was followed by the Coordinate Bench of this
Court in Mohd. Arbaz vs State of NCT of Delhi CRL. REV. P.
1219/2019 on 03.11.2020, wherein it was observed that the accused
should not be entitled to bail in default as the charge sheet was already
filed. The Court held that the report shall not form part of the charge
sheet and hence, the bail under Section 167(2) was rejected. An
appeal against the said judgement is pending before the Hon'ble
Supreme Court in Mohd. Arbaz vs State of NCT of Delhi SLP(Crl.)
Nos. 8164-8166/2021. The observation of the Hon’ble High Court
“…24. This Court concurs with the view expressed by the
Coordinate Bench of this Court in Babu (supra). Thus, the
view expressed by the Division Bench of Punjab and
Haryana High Court in Ajit Singh @Jeeta(supra) and the
view expressed by the Bombay High Court in Sunil
VasantraoPhulbande(supra),convinced this Court that the
view of the Division Bench in Kishan Lal (supra) is binding.
25. In view of the above, the petitioners’ contention that the
report submitted on 27.05.2019 could not be construed as a
report under Section 173(2) of the Cr.PC must be rejected.
The first question is, thus, answered in the negative…”
13.     At present, the settled law persists in the view that non filing of
FSL Report with the charge sheet does not fall within the realms of
Section 173(2) of the Cr.P.C so as to consider it as “incomplete
report”. In the present case although FSL Report has not been filed,
however, the charge sheet was already filed on 03.03.2021 within the
time period as per law. Further, the amount of quantity recovered from
the accused is of commercial nature baring the accused from bail
under Section 37 of the NDPS Act.
14.    In view of the above, the court finds no infirmity in the
impugned order dated 05.05.2022. The application moved by the
petitioners seeking bail in default under the provisions of Section
167(2) of the Cr.P.C. is dismissed.
