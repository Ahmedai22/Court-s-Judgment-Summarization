I.A. No. 6905/2021 under Section 149 of CPC
1.     The plaintiffs have affixed Court-fees of Rs.1,950/- on the
plaint on the ground that the plaintiffs intend to challenge the Court-
fees Act. According to the plaintiffs, if the justice dispensation
system requires around 15-20 years for settlement of a suit, the Court
has lost the moral as well as legal right to require the Court-fees to
be paid upfront at the beginning of the suit. The plaintiffs further
intend to challenge the Court-fees Act in terms of the original intent
of the Act being to recoup the costs for administration of justice,
whereas the present system is such that the inflow of the Court-fees
far exceeds the amount spent by the State on providing the
infrastructure to dispense justice. Relevant portion of the application
“3. That the suit has been filed by affixing court fees of
Rs. 1,950 for the present, and the plaintiffs / applicants
seeks time to deposit the balance (if any).
4. That it is also their intent to challenge the Court
Fees Act on the grounds, inter alia, that if the justice
dispensation system requires around 15-20 years for
settlement of a suit, it has lost the moral as well as
legal right to require the court fees to be paid upfront
at the beginning of the suit.
5. That it is also their intent to challenge the Court
Fees Act in terms of the original intent of the Act being
to recoup the costs for administration of justice,
whereas the present system is such that the inflow of
fees far exceeds the amount spent by the State on
providing the infrastructure to dispense justice.
6. That under these circumstances, if the court fee be
found short, this Hon'ble Court may be pleased to
record the undertaking of the plaintiffs to pay whatever
be the appropriate court fee within four weeks of this
Hon'ble Court granting time to do so, or within 4
weeks of losing their challenge to the Court Fees act (if
he loses), whichever be later.
In view of the aforesaid facts and circumstances, it is
prayed that this Hon'ble Court may be pleased to :
(a) Allow this application, and grant appropriate time
to the plaintiff to pay the full Court Fees as may be
applicable to the matter (if the Court Fees paid at all
be short).
(b) Allow that the time to be fixed by this Hon'ble
Court be fixed keeping in mind the challenge to be
raised to the Court Fees Act.”
2.      The plaintiffs seek time to pay the Court-fees under Section
149 read with Section 148 of CPC because of COVID-19 constraints
and Plaintiff No. 1’s visit to South Africa on or around 26th May,
3.     Since the quantum of Court-fees quantified by the plaintiffs in
para 147 of the plaint (at Rs. 12,210) may, perhaps, also be called into
question (namely, as to how, in any case, the Court-fees cannot be
less than Rs. 2 lakhs, especially since, at para 164, the suit has been
valued by the plaintiffs themselves at Rs. 2 crores), the plaintiffs are
ready to immediately file elaborate Written Submissions on this
aspect, if required by this Court to do so.
4.     Without this becoming an issue at this stage, and subject to
their rights being permitted by this Court to stand preserved, the
plaintiffs undertake to pay whatever Court-fees is required by the
Registry to be paid, under directions of this Court after reading the
Written Submissions to be filed herein, in the time to be stipulated
by this Court.
5.     This Court, while allowing the application and granting
deferment for whatever period of time this Court deems fit, may
make it clear that the quantum of Court-fees is yet to be decided by
this Court, thereby allowing fair opportunity to the plaintiffs to
present their arguments on this point in due course.
6.     Nonetheless, if this Court wishes, the plaintiffs agree to pay
whatever Court-fees as may be directed by this Court, subject to
preservation of all their rights and contentions by this Court.
7.     The resolution of this particular issue, if in favour of the
plaintiffs, shall be a landmark judgment by this Court, as it is their
respectfully-submitted contention that it is an erroneous proposition
in law to hold that Court-fees is payable on either the value of relief
claimed, or the pecuniary jurisdiction of the Court, whichever is
higher; it is their case that the Court-fees is to be paid only on the
value of the relief claimed, independent of the valuation of the suit
for the purposes of pecuniary jurisdiction.
8.     The plaintiffs have valued the suit for purpose of jurisdiction
at Rs.2 Crore. The law is well settled that the valuation of the suit for
the purpose of jurisdiction and Court-fees has to be same. In that
view of the matter, the plaintiffs are liable to pay Court-fees of
Rs.1,97,544/- on the plaint. As such, there is deficiency of the Court-
fees of Rs.1,95,594/- by the plaintiffs.
9.     Section 149 of Code of Civil Procedure empowers this Court
to extend the time to pay the deficient Court-fees. However, the
challenge sought by the plaintiffs into the validity of the Court-fees
Act is not permissible under Section 149 of Code of Civil Procedure.
As such, no case for determination of the Court-fees amount is made
10.    The application is misconceived, frivolous and unsustainable.
The law with respect to valuation and computation of Court-fees is
well settled. However, the plaintiffs have taken a stand not to pay the
Court-fees in utter disregard of well-settled law. All the objections
raised by the plaintiffs to the payment of Court-fees are hereby
rejected.
11.    The application is partially allowed and in interest of justice,
the plaintiffs are granted one week to deposit the deficit Court-fees
of Rs.1,95,594/-.
I.A. No. 6909/2021 under Section 80(2) of CPC
12.    The plaintiffs are seeking dispensation from issuing notice to
the State entities under Section 80(1) of the Code of Civil Procedure
on the ground that it is an empty formality. Relevant portion of the
application is reproduced hereunder:
“3. That in any case, all the State entities have been
served with this suit prior to filing of the same, the suit
itself being fair notice, and yet, they have not appeared
before this Hon'ble Court, this itself being their waiver
to objecting to grant of interim relief.
4.That under these circumstances, it is humbly prayed
that the empty formality of issuance of notice may be
dispensed with in exercise of this Hon'ble Courts
power under Section 80(2) CPC.
It is therefore most respectfully and humbly prayed
that this Hon‟ble Court may be pleased to :-
i. Exercise its power under Section 80(2) CPC, and
dispense with the empty formality of issuance of notice
to State entities under Section 80(1) of the CPC.”
13.     Section 80(2) empowers this Court to waive the requirement
of prior notice on State Defendants and/or prior 60 days’ wait,
subject to the caveat that it shall not grant relief in the suit, whether
interim or otherwise, except after giving the State Defendants a
reasonable opportunity of showing cause in respect of the reliefs
prayed for in the suit.
14.     Since the 5G roll-out has not actually happened, though -
equally damaging - trials involving the human population have
started (which is not the same as doing trials on pigs and/or rats,
and/or in an empty Thar Desert, or on the employees of the private
defendants) - so that not even one single human life is lost by these
trials, the plaintiffs are agreeable if this Court, while waiving the
requirement of Section 80(1) of the CPC, grants fair opportunity to
the State Defendants to show cause as to why no interim relief be
granted which, in any case, is sought against the private defendants,
and not against the State defendants.
15.     In any case, all the State defendants have been served with the
suit, and have appeared today, which constitutes compliance with the
spirit of Section 80(1) of the CPC.
16.     The notice under Section 80(1) of the Code of Civil Procedure
to the Government is mandatory before institution of the suit against
the Government. The object of the notice under Section 80(1) is to
give an opportunity to the Government to reconsider the matter and
to make amends and settle the claim out of Court. Section 80 was
enacted for the advancement of justice for securing public good by
avoidance of unnecessary litigation.
17.     In State of Andhra Pradesh v. Gundugola Venkata
Suryanarayana Garu, AIR 1965 SC 11, the Supreme Court
observed that the object of the notice under Section 80(1) is to give
an opportunity to the Government to reconsider the matter and to
make amends and settle the claim out of Court. The Supreme Court
further observed that Section 80(1) is imperative and must be strictly
complied with. The Supreme Court further observed that failure to
serve a notice complying with the requirements of the statute will
entail dismissal of the suit. Relevant portion of the judgment is
“11. The object of the notice under Section 80 is to
give to the Government or the public servant
concerned an opportunity to reconsider its or his legal
position and if that course is justified to make amends
or settle the claim out of Court. The section is
imperative and must undoubtedly be strictly construed:
failure to serve a notice complying with the
requirements of the statute will entail dismissal of the
suit. But the notice must be reasonably construed.
Every venial error or defect cannot be permitted to be
treated as a peg to hang a defence to defeat a just
claim. In each case in considering whether the
imperative provisions of the statute are complied with,
the Court must face the following questions:
(1) whether the name, description and residence of the
plaintiff are given so to enable the authorities to
identify the person serving the notice;
(2) whether the cause of action and the relief which the
plaintiff claims are set out with sufficient particularity;
(3) whether the notice in writing has been delivered to
or left at the office of the appropriate authority
(4) whether the suit is instituted after the expiration of
two months next after notice has been served, and the
plaint contains a statement that such a notice has been
so delivered or left.
In construing the notice the Court cannot ignore the
object of the Legislature to give to the Government or
the public servant concerned an opportunity to
reconsider its or his legal position. If on a reasonable
reading but not so as to make undue assumptions the
plaintiff is shown to have given the information which
the statute requires him to give, any incidental defects
or errors may be ignored.”
18.    In State of A.P. v. Pioneer Builders, A.P., (2006) 12 SCC
119, the Supreme Court held that service of notice under Section 80
is a condition precedent for the institution of a suit against the
Government. The Supreme Court further observed that the object of
Section 80 is the advancement of justice for securing public good by
avoidance of unnecessary litigation. The relevant portion of the
“14. From a bare reading of sub-section (1) of Section
80, it is plain that subject to what is provided in sub-
section (2) thereof, no suit can be filed against the
Government or a public officer unless requisite notice
under the said provision has been served on such
Government or public officer, as the case may be. It is
well settled that before the amendment of Section 80
the provisions of unamended Section 80 admitted of no
implications and exceptions whatsoever and are
express, explicit and mandatory. The section imposes a
statutory and unqualified obligation upon the court
and in the absence of compliance with Section 80, the
suit     is    not     maintainable.      (See Bhagchand
Dagadusa v. Secy. of State for India in Council [(1926-
Nirmal Chand v. Union of India [(1966) 1 SCR 986 :
AIR 1966 SC 1068] and Bihari Chowdhary v. State of
Bihar [(1984) 2 SCC 627].) The service of notice
under Section 80 is, thus, a condition precedent for the
institution of a suit against the Government or a public
officer. The legislative intent of the section is to give
the Government sufficient notice of the suit, which is
proposed to be filed against it so that it may reconsider
the decision and decide for itself whether the claim
made could be accepted or not. As observed in Bihari
Chowdhary [(1984) 2 SCC 627] the object of the
section is the advancement of justice and the securing
of public good by avoidance of unnecessary litigation.
17. Thus, from a conjoint reading of sub-sections (1)
and (2) of Section 80, the legislative intent is clear,
namely, service of notice under sub-section (1) is
imperative except where urgent and immediate relief is
to be granted by the court, in which case a suit against
the Government or a public officer may be instituted,
but with the leave of the court. Leave of the court is a
condition precedent. Such leave must precede the
institution of a suit without serving notice. Even though
Section 80(2) does not specify how the leave is to be
sought for or given, yet the order granting leave must
indicate the ground(s) pleaded and application of mind
thereon. A restriction on the exercise of power by the
court has been imposed, namely, the court cannot
grant relief, whether interim or otherwise, except after
giving the Government or a public officer a reasonable
opportunity of showing cause in respect of relief
prayed for in the suit.
18. Having regard to the legislative intent noticed
above, it needs little emphasis that the power conferred
on the court under sub-section (2) is to avoid genuine
hardship and is, therefore, coupled with a duty to grant
leave to institute a suit without complying with the
requirements of sub-section (1) thereof, bearing in
mind only the urgency of the relief prayed for and not
the merits of the case. More so, when want of notice
under sub-section (1) is also made good by providing
that even in urgent matters relief under this provision
shall not be granted without giving a reasonable
opportunity to the Government or a public officer to
show cause in respect of the relief prayed for. The
provision also mandates that if the court is of the
opinion that no urgent or immediate relief deserves to
be granted it should return the plaint for presentation
after complying with the requirements contemplated in
sub-section (1).”
19.    In State of Kerala v. Sudhir Kumar Sharma, (2013) 10 SCC
178, the Supreme Court observed that a suit filed without
compliance of Section 80(1) of the Code of Civil Procedure cannot
be regularized by simply filing an application under Section 80(2) of
the Code of Civil Procedure.
20.    The plaintiffs’ contention that Section 80(1) notice is an
empty formality is contrary to the well settled law and is hereby
21.    This Court is of the view that the notice under Section 80(1)
of the Code of Civil Procedure is necessary in the present case. The
application is therefore, dismissed.
I.A. No. 7001/2021 under Section 91(1)(b) of CPC
22.    The plaintiffs are seeking leave to institute this suit on various
grounds inter-alia that the matter concerns public health and EMF
radiation caused by cellular telecommunication technology must
have caused harm to many members of the general public.
23.    While Section 91(1)(b) of the CPC has been invoked, it is
respectfully submitted that Section 91 has been invoked only in
relation to the „wrongful acts‟ of the defendants, the „wrongful acts‟
relating to the act of omission in not completing studies on the health
hazards of 5G before permitting any further activity in that field.
Therefore, only some of the prayers in the suit relate to „wrongful
acts‟ of the defendants, such as prayer (xiii), the other prayers,
though also relating to the acts of omission on the part of the State
defendants, however, are more in the exercise of the statutory rights
of the plaintiffs. The Supreme Court has settled the proposition that
the ‘precautionary principle‟ stands embedded within the fold of
Article 21 of the Constitution of India, thereby conferring statutory
(rather, fundamental) rights upon the plaintiffs even independent of
24.    The suit also seeks prayers that, though connected, can also be
sought de hors the „wrongful acts‟ of the defendants, and have been
preferred by the plaintiffs in exercise of their statutory rights e.g.
prayer (i) which is under Order XXVII-A of the CPC.
25.    Even independent of grant of permission under Section
91(1)(b) of the CPC, the suit ought to be permitted to proceed,
where, at the highest, the issue of whether or not prior leave was
actually required in respect of each and every single prayer could,
become one of the issues to be framed in the suit.
26.    Since numerous admissions of the defendants themselves have
been tabled, which clearly show that they are guilty of „wrongful
acts‟, as the plaintiffs do not wish to rely upon a State actor to
prosecute the present cause on their behalf (i.e. the learned Standing
Counsel), they humbly request this Court to grant leave under
Section 91(1)(b) of the CPC for such prayers that this Court deems
appropriate to be covered under the aforesaid provision.
27.    As the plaintiffs have themselves suffered special as well as
general injury, therefore, as is made clear by the provisions of Sub-
Section (2) of Section 91 of the CPC, the suit ought to be permitted
to be proceeded with by this Court even if, for any reason, it is not
inclined to grant leave under Sub-Section (1) (b) of Section 91.
28.    The provision is supposed to be an aid to the citizens of India,
whereby a duty is cast upon the learned Standing Counsel to
prosecute on their behalf. In other words, it is an enabling provision,
intended to assist the general populace in conserving their own time
and money when they be acting in general public interest, and not
intended to become a hindrance in their path of seeking justice, if
and when they be agreeable to pursue justice at the expense of their
own time, their own money and their own effort and which is why
there is no such similar stipulation with respect to Public Interest
Litigations preferred under the Constitution of India.
I.A. No. 7002/2021 under Order VIII Rule 1 of CPC
29.    The plaintiffs are seeking leave to sue in representative
interest on the ground that colossal harm is eminent to general public
by the roll out of 5G technology and the suit involves issues
regarding public health of the present as well as future generations.
30.    The plaintiffs, especially Plaintiff No. 1, who has been
publicly and vociferously canvassing against the effects of EMF
radiation for the last decade or so, have been approached by a
number of individuals, requesting them to initiate legal proceedings
against the „silent killer‟ that exists in our country’s air, and who
have expressed their desire to join them in such proceedings.
31.    As time, in light of COVID-19 constraints, was too short to
actually call upon all the other interested individuals to join hands in
the present suit, hence, it is in that respect that leave has been sought
by this Court to sue also in a representative interest, so that such
individuals, after release of appropriate advertisement, also can join
the proceedings in due course.
32.    Since the plaintiffs, themselves, have individually suffered
special as well as general damages, it is not the case of the plaintiffs
that the suit cannot proceed if the permission under Order I Rule 8 of
the CPC is to be denied by this Court.
33.    In fact, grant of leave of this Court will give a first-hand
opportunity to this Court to assess how actually widespread is the
antagonism of members of the public at large against the acts of
omission of our regulatory agencies, just as was the case with
tobacco, pan masala, asbestos, etc.
34.    In other words, the number of co-plaintiffs that are likely to
join the present proceedings will undoubtedly rock the conscience of
this Court into being sympathetic to the cause of present (as well as
unborn) generation(s) against what is undeniably a „silent killer‟.
Findings in respect of I.A. Nos. 7001/2021 and 7002/2021
35.    No case for grant of leave to institute the suit is made out
under Section 91(1)(b) of the Code of Civil Procedure or to sue in
representative interest under Order I Rule 8 of the Code of Civil
Procedure or to maintain the suit without the aforesaid
leave/permission, as the plaintiffs’ suit is defective and not
maintainable for the following reasons :-
I.      Order VI Rule 2(1) of the Code of Civil Procedure
provides that the plaint shall contain statements of material
facts in a concise form but no evidence by which they are
to be proved. However, the plaintiffs have not complied
with Order VI Rule 2 of the Code of Civil Procedure as (i)
The statement of plaintiffs are not in concise form and (ii)
The plaintiffs have incorporated the evidence in the plaint.
II.     Order VI Rule 9 of the Code of Civil Procedure
provides that the contents of any document shall not be set
out in the plaint unless the precise words of the document
or any part thereof are material. However, the plaintiffs
have not complied with Order VI Rule 9 of the Code of
Civil Procedure and have reproduced the documents in the
plaint.
III.     The plaint is stuffed with unnecessary scandalous,
frivolous and vexatious averments which are liable to be
struck down under Order VI Rule 16 of the Code of
IV.      The plaintiffs have joined 33 defendants in this suit.
However, the plaint does not reflect the compliance of
Order I Rule 3 of the Code of Civil Procedure in joining
33 defendants in one suit.
V.       The plaintiffs have joined various causes of action without
complying with Order II Rule 3 of the Code of Civil
VI.      The plaintiffs have not verified the plaint which is
mandatory under Order VI Rule 15 of the Code of Civil
VII.     In the affidavit filed along with the plaint, the plaintiffs
have deposed that only paras 1 to 8 of the plaint are true to
their knowledge whereas paras 1 to 169 of the plaint are
based on information and legal advice, meaning thereby
that the plaintiffs have no personal knowledge of any of
the averments made in the plaint. The suit totally based
upon information and legal advice is not maintainable.
VIII.    Since the plaintiffs have no personal knowledge of any
averments made in the plaint and the whole plaint is based
on information and legal advice received, it appears that
the plaintiffs want an inquiry to be conducted by this Court
into the averments made in the plaint which is not
permissible in law in these proceedings.
IX.      Section 34 of the Specific Relief Act, 1963 deals with
declaratory suits. A person entitled to any legal character
can institute a suit against another person who denies or is
interested to deny his right. In the present case, the
plaintiffs never approached the defendants claiming any
right and therefore, there was no occasion for the
defendants to respond or deny to the plaintiffs alleged
rights. In that view of the matter, the maintainability of the
declaratory reliefs sought by the plaintiffs is doubtful.
X.       Section 39 of the Specific Relief Act, 1963 deals with
mandatory injunctions. The twin requirements of Section
39 are the existence of an obligation of the defendant
towards the plaintiff and the breach thereof by the
defendant. Both these requirements are not fulfilled. The
maintainability of the mandatory injunctions sought by the
plaintiffs are, therefore, doubtful.
XI.      The plaintiffs have not valued the suit properly for the
purpose of Court-fees.
XII.     The plaintiffs have not given the mandatory notice under
Section 80(1) of the Code of Civil Procedure.
36.    The observations made by Justice Rajiv Sahai Endlaw in one
of the cases that ‘This is a classic textbook case of, how not to draft
a plaint, which should be taught in law colleges and to young
lawyers so that such bloopers in drafting of pleadings, damaging to
one’s own client, are avoided‟ is fully applicable to the present case.
37.    The plaintiffs filed this suit on 28th May, 2021 in which the
Registry raised an objection to the maintainability of the suit. The
plaintiffs, instead of explaining how the suit is maintainable,
requested the Registry to list the suit as it is with defects and the
plaintiffs undertook to bear the cost and consequences of the same,
whereupon the Registry listed this matter, subject to objections,
before this Court.
38.    The entire suit filed by the plaintiffs is under Section 91 of the
Code of Civil Procedure read with Order XXVII-A and Order I Rule
8 of the Code of Civil Procedure. However, no application was filed
along with this suit to seek the leave of this Court to institute this
suit.
39.    On 31st May, 2021, the plaintiffs filed two applications
namely I.A. Nos. 7001/2021 and 7002/2021 seeking leave to sue
under Section 91(1)(b) of the Code of Civil Procedure and Order I
Rule 8 of the Code of Civil Procedure. Although the plaint is not
based on any special damage suffered by plaintiffs by EMF radiation
caused by cellular telecommunication technology, the plaintiffs have
attempted to set up a new plea in I.A. Nos. 7001/2021 and
7002/2021 that the plaintiffs have been advised that they suffered
special damages because of EMF radiation caused by cellular
telecommunication technology.
40.    I.A. Nos. 6909/2021, 7001/2021 and 7002/2021 are dismissed.
However, I.A. No. 6905/2021 is partially allowed and the plaintiffs
are directed to deposit the deficit Court-fees of Rs.1,95,594/- within
one week, failing which the Registry shall recover the Court-fees
from the plaintiffs. Consequently, the suit is also dismissed. All
other applications are disposed of.
41.    The plaintiffs have abused and misused the process of law
which has resulted in waste of judicial time. The cost of Rs.20 lakhs
is imposed on the plaintiffs. The plaintiffs are directed to deposit the
cost of Rs.20 lakhs with Delhi State Legal Services Authority
(DSLSA) within one week. If the cost is not deposited within one
week, DSLSA shall recover the same from the plaintiffs in
accordance with law. DSLSA shall utilize this cost for the cause of
the victims of road accidents.
42.    If any proceedings are instituted by the Plaintiffs without the
deposit of the deficient Court-fees of Rs.1,95,594/- and the cost of
Rs.20 lakhs, the Registry shall place the copy of this judgment
before the concerned Court in those proceedings.
43.    It appears that the plaintiffs have filed this suit to gain
publicity which is clear from the fact that plaintiff No.1 circulated
the video conferencing link of this Court on her social media
accounts, which resulted in the repeated disruption of the Court
proceedings.
44.    During the course of the hearing of this suit, the Court
proceedings were disrupted thrice by the unknown miscreants who
continued the disruptions despite repeated warnings. Issue show
cause notice to the persons who disrupted the Court proceedings as
to why the proceedings for contempt of Court be not initiated against
them. The Delhi Police shall identify the persons and serve the
notice on them.
45.    List for reporting compliance before Joint Registrar on 05th
