1.     The order dated 27th August 2022, passed by the learned
Additional District Judge (“the learned ADJ”) in CS 898/2022 (Pawan
Kumar Kakaria v. Anil Kumar Rai), under challenge in the present
petition under Article 227 of the Constitution of India, reads thus:
Present: Sh. Harish Katyal Ld counsel for plaintiff.
Plaintiff has relied upon certain documents which is
purported - to be entries regarding receiving of payment by
defendant in the diary being maintained by the defendant No.
I only. The plaintiff has not given any notice under Order XlI
Rule 8 CPC to defendant No. 1 before filing of the suit.
Further, there is no other acknowledgment of the defendant
which is in the possession of plaintiff.
When the Court raised a query to the Ld counsel about
the authenticity of these documents and as to why notice be
issued to defendant when there is only photocopy of
documents, the original of which are not available with the
plaintiff and further about the limitation also the Ld counsel
submits that he is 'shocked and surprised' to hear this.
In my considered opinion, the use of such words does
not behove to an advocate and an advocate is supposed to
answer the query raised by the Court.
Ld counsel is directed to satisfy the Court on its
queries. Timesought for same. Heard. Allowed.
Put up on 21.09.2022 for consideration.”
2.           The prayer clause in this petition reads thus:
“The Petitioner named above in view of the submissions
made herein above most respectfully prayed before this
Hon'ble court that this Hon'ble Court may be pleased to pass
the following directions/Orders:
a)     To pass such order setting aside the impugned
order dated 27.08.2022 and/or expunge the remarks
made therein, in CS DJ No. 898 of 2022, Titled Pawan
Kumar Kakaria Vs. Sh. Anil Rai & Anr. pending in the
court of Sh. Hemraj A.D.J. Central Tis Hazari Courts
and issue summon to the Defendant/ respondent for the
b)     To pass such order allowed the Application of
the petitioner and direct the ld. Trial Court to take the
Mended Written Statement on record and proceed the
c)     To pass such other Order(s) as this Hon'ble
Court may deem just and proper in the facts and
circumstances of the instant case.”
3.     A reading of the impugned order reveals that the present
petition is essentially premature. The impugned order merely seeks a
response, from the Counsel for the petitioner, to certain queries posed
by the Court. There is no question of this Court interfering at this
stage of the proceedings, under Article 227 of the Constitution of
India. It would be for learned Counsel to satisfy the learned ADJ
regarding the queries raised by him.
4.     However, the Court notes that the learned ADJ has entered
certain adverse comments about the language used by the Counsel for
the petitioner/plaintiff during arguments.
5.     Learned Counsel for the petitioner expresses his sincere and
unconditional apology for not having addressed the Court in an
inappropriate fashion and undertakes that such an occurrence would
not recur.
6.     Counsel are, on all occasions, expected to address the Court
with deference and respect. Mutual respect between Bench and Bar is
the indispensable sine qua non for a vibrant and vigorous legal system
to function. It cannot be said, therefore, that, in expressing “shock and
surprise” at the query posed by the learned ADJ, the learned Counsel
conformed to the most appropriate standards of legal discourse. The
apology tendered at the Bar is, therefore, accepted.
7.     That said, however, I am of the opinion that the language used
by the learned Counsel was not so objectionable as to have invited
adverse remarks against the Counsel.
8.     Adverse remark against Counsel, in a judicial order, has serious
and far-reaching consequences. Courts should abjure from entering
such remarks or exhibiting needless sensitivity about utterances by
Counsel in Court. Often, in the heat of arguments, the language used
by Counsel may not be most circumspect. The Court is expected to be
alive and sensitive to this fact. A brotherly word of advice, across the
Bar, is often all that is required on such occasions.
9.     The adverse comment against Counsel, as contained in the
impugned order dated 27th August 2022, accordingly stands expunged.
10.    This petition is disposed of in limine in the aforesaid terms.
