1. This appeal is directed against the judgment dated 21 st March,
2007 passed by the learned Sessions Judge, Mayurbhanj in ST
Case No.175 of 2005 convicting the Appellant for the offence
punishable under Section 302 IPC for the murder of his cousin,
Basanta Kumar Naik and sentencing him to life imprisonment and
to pay a fine of Rs.500/- in default to undergo rigorous
imprisonment (RI) for three months.
2. At the outset it requires to be noted that pursuant to the order
dated 21st April, 2022 of this Court, the IIC, Karanjia Police
Station, Mayurbhanj has submitted a report on 5 th May, 2022
JCRLA 51 of 2007                                      Page 1 of 8
stating that the Appellant is staying in his house with his wife and
his other family members.
3. The case of the prosecution is that on 23/24 th April, 2005
around midnight, the deceased quarreled with his wife, Gouri
Naik (P.W.1) and during such quarrel, the accused, who was the
cousin of the deceased, came there and challenged the deceased
for picking up quarrels with the family members regularly. Due to
such challenge, there was a hot exchange of words between the
deceased and the accused. Thereafter, the accused returned to his
house and returned back with a sword and assaulted the deceased,
as a result of which the deceased sustained severe bleeding
injuries and died at the spot.
4. A telephonic message was sent to the police. Mr. Somanath
Sahu, attached to the Karanjia Police Station (PS) (P.W.10)
proceeded to the spot, took down the report of P.W.1, registered it
as an FIR and took up the investigation. He then arrested the
accused, held an inquest over the dead body, prepared inquest
report and sent the body for Post-Mortem (PM). While in custody,
the accused offered to produce the sword used to murder the
deceased and pursuant thereto, the sword (MO-1) was seized from
a straw heap near the house of the deceased. A charge-sheet was
filed. The accused denied the charge and claimed trial.
5. Ten witnesses were examined for the prosecution, which
included the Investigating Officer (IO)-P.W.10. The eye-
JCRLA 51 of 2007                                         Page 2 of 8
witnesses were P.W.1 (the wife of the deceased), Smt. Gaya Naik
(P.W.2), the aunt of the accused and the mother of the deceased
and the father of the deceased-Hari Naik (P.W.4).
6. The cross-examination of P.W.1 did not yield anything at all
for the defence. She stated that it was a moonlit night on the date
of the occurrence. She stated that the deceased had taken liquor
and that the parents of the deceased were also present when the
accused assaulted her husband with the sword. She denied the
suggestion that at the time of the incident the deceased was armed
with an axe or that he tried to assault the accused with that axe or
in the result of a tussle with the accused, the deceased had
sustained injuries.
7. As far as P.W.2 is concerned, she too stood firm in her cross-
examination. While she said she was not able to see clearly in the
night, she still denied that it was not the accused who had
murdered the deceased. As far as P.W.3 is concerned, he too was
unable to be shaken in the cross-examination.
8. Faced with the above facts, which clearly point to the guilt of
the accused beyond reasonable doubt, learned counsel for the
Appellant sought to build the case of the offence being one of
culpable homicide not amounting to murder. Reliance was placed
on the decisions of the Supreme Court in State of Himachal
Pradesh v. Wazir Chand (1978) 1 SCC 130, Ravi Kumar v. State
of Punjab (2005) 9 SCC 315, Surinder Kumar v. Union
JCRLA 51 of 2007                                        Page 3 of 8
Territory, Chandigarh (1989) 2 SCC 217, Pardeshiram v. State
of Madhya Pradesh (2021) 3 SCC 238 and Gurmukh Singh v.
State of Haryana (2009) 15 SCC 635.
9. Learned counsel for the Appellant relied on the decision in
Wazir Chand (supra) to make it appear that it was a sudden fight
flowing from an earlier incident. As regards the fact situation in
Wazir Chand (supra), it is noticed from the said judgment by this
Court that there was only one injury in that case, which was
opined to be sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause
death. This was one of four injuries leading to the inference that
the other three were obviously viewed as serious injuries.
10. The present case is not one of a sudden quarrel at all. After the
quarrel between the deceased and the accused, the accused
returned to his house, and then returned to the house of the
deceased with a sword and assaulted the deceased with it.
Therefore, this was clearly pre-planned. The intention to commit
the murder was apparent from the huge number of injuries on the
body of the deceased. The injuries were as under:
"(ii) Multiple injuries present with clean cut margin under
both the deltoid region, left side of the neck, left thigh,
dorsum of right palm, right maxilla and contact abrasion
on the chest i.e. (a) cut wound on the left arm deltoid
region of size 7" x 3" x 2 ½'' horizontally situated and have
felling out medially by contact abrasion 3" length
corresponding fracture of humorous present.
(b) Similar cut wound present on the right deltoid region of
size 7" x 3" x 3'' and felling laterally underlying humorous
fracture present.
(c) Two definite cut wounds whose margins are adhered
together present on the left side of the neck of size 6 ½'' x 3
½'' x 2'' and partially mandible is cut, Left side major
vessels of the neck are cut.
(d) cut would present on the dorsum of the right palm 1 ½''
(e) Similar cut wound on the lower part of the left thigh
present of size 2 ½" x 1" x ½ c.m.
(f) 7" horizontally situated one contact abrasion present on
the right side of the chest extending from just above nipple
to posterior margin of auxilla, where one stab wound of
size 1" x ½" x ½" was present.
(g) Similar contact abrasion present obliquely on the mid
part of the chest of size 10" length.
(h) Similar contact abrasion of size 4" present on the front
of neck."
11. All of the injuries were said to be ante-mortem in nature and
the cause of death was due to haemorrhagic shock due to
homicidal cut injuries by a sharp cutting weapon. In other words,
it was not just any one injury that caused the death of the
deceased, but all of the above cut injuries. The cross-examination
of the doctor (P.W.8) did not bring out anything at all for the
defence. He clearly stated that such injuries are not possible “by
fall over a sharp-edged stone.”
12. Although the Appellant sought to put forth an alternative
theory of the deceased being armed with an axe, he could not
produce any evidence to make good such defence. Turning to the
next decision in Ravi Kumar (supra), in the said case there was a
quarrel between the accused and the deceased on the previous
JCRLA 51 of 2007                                           Page 5 of 8
date. On the next day, the accused and the deceased had talks.
During the course of talks, a quarrel again ensued and the accused
took up a Dhangu and gave two blows on the head of the
deceased. The Dhangu was not brought by the accused but it was
found behind the deceased, which was picked up by the accused.
These facts therefore show that indeed the incident happened on
the spur of the moment whereas in the present case, the accused
returned with the sword after a quarrel had taken place and,
therefore, clearly intended to murder the deceased.
13. In Surinder Kumar (supra), the following facts make it clear
that it was in a different set of circumstances that the Supreme
Court in the said decision converted the offence to one under
"3. On January 3, 1975, at about 7.15 p.m., PW 2 and his
deceased brother had an heated argument with the
appellant and his brother Amrit Lal in regard to the return
of the kitchen. In the course of this heated exchange PW
2 is alleged to have showered filthy abuses. Although PW
2 denies this fact, PW 4 has admitted the same. PW 2 also
threatened to throw out the utensils and lock the kitchen.
Since PW 2 was uttering filthy abuses in the presence of
the appellant's sister and Nitya Nand did not restrain him,
the appellant got enraged, went into the kitchen and
returned with a knife with which he inflicted one blow on
the neck of PW 2 causing a bleeding injury. In the melee
the appellant inflicted three knife blows to Nitya Nand;
one on the shoulder, the other on the elbow and the third
on the chest, as a result whereof Nitya Nand collapsed to
the floor and later died while on the way to the hospital."
14. Clearly therefore Nitya Nand, who was the deceased, was not
the target, but it was P.W.2, who was the target and Nitya Nand,
JCRLA 51 of 2007                                        Page 6 of 8
who intervened, got attacked. The facts here are very different and
cannot be brought within Exception 4 to Section 300 IPC.
15. In Pardeshiram (supra), there was a dispute as regards to a
agricultural land prior to the incident and at the time of the
incident, a quarrel had started on the issue of construction of a
wall on the said land. The Appellant had hit the deceased with a
shovel, a common agricultural tool, which was available at the
spot. These facts clearly revealed that the crime happened at the
spur of the moment and quiet unlike the present case where the
accused returned with the sword to the house of the deceased and
inflicted numerous sword wounds on his person.
16. In the last-mentioned case, Gurmukh Singh(supra), the facts
were very different, which read as under:
"3. According to the prosecution version, on 8.1.1997 in
the morning, deceased Hazoor Singh had borrowed the
tractor of Lal Singh and tiller of Gurbachan Singh.
Gurmej Singh, P.W.5, son of Hazoor Singh (the
deceased) was going along with Lal Singh to return the
tractor at the Dera of Gurbachan Singh. On the way,
accused Gurmukh Singh, son of Dayal Singh,
accompanied by the co-accused Niranjan Singh,
Harbhajan Singh and Manjit Singh armed with lathis,
whose Dera was nearby came and stopped the tractor.
The appellant raised a lalkara that Hazoor Singh and his
son should not be allowed to pass through the passage of
which there was a dispute between the parties. Hazoor
Singh was following the tractor. He advised the appellant
to desist from stopping the tractor on which the appellant
gave a lathi-blow on the head of the deceased Hazoor
Singh rendering him unconscious, resulting in his fall on
the ground.”
17. No comparison could be drawn with the above facts and the
facts on hand. Consequently, the Court is not persuaded that in the
present case the offence should be converted to one punishable
under Section 304 Part II IPC.
18. For all of the aforementioned reasons, the Court finds no error
committed by the trial Court in convicting the Appellant for the
offence punishable under Section 302 IPC.
19. However, it has been brought to the notice of the Court that
during the pendency of the appeal, the Government of Odisha in
exercise of the powers conferred by Section 432 of the Code of
Criminal Procedure, 1973 remitted the unexpired portion of the
sentence passed against the accused and ordered his premature
release vide a letter (File No.IV-J-05/2021 6049 dated 21st June,
2021) of the Joint Secretary to Government in the Law
Department communicated to the I.G. Prisons and DCS Odisha,
Bhubaneswar. Pursuant thereto, the Appellant has already been
released. The said letter is kept on record.
20. In view of the above, no further steps need be taken against
the Appellant. Accordingly, the appeal is disposed of.
