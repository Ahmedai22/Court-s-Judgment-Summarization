1. District Collector Pali, dist. Pali
4. Hira Lal, Khandpa, ward no. 17, Member Panchayat Samiti,
The matter comes up on an application (Inward No. 02/22)
for early hearing.
It is noted that the case is listed in the ‘Orders’ category as
an application (Inward No. 02/22) of some other writ petition has
wrongly been tagged with this file and the next date in the said
petition is 28.09.2022.
The office is directed to tag the said application appropriately
in the correct file.
With the consent of the learned counsel for the parties, the
matter is being heard and decided finally today itself.
The present writ petition has been filed against the notice
dated 09.09.2016 issued by respondent No. 2–Tehsildar, whereby,
the petitioner has been directed to shift his poultry farm.
(2 of 3)           [CW-10623/2016]
Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that the petitioner
established a poultry farm in Khasra No. 566, Village Musaliya,
Tehsil Marwar Junction, District Pali. He further submits that he is
running the poultry farm after taking a “No Objection Certificate”
from the Gram Panchayat, Musaliya vide their resolution dated
20.09.1998 (Annex. 3). Learned counsel further submits that he
has complied with all the eligibility and requisite qualifications for
running the poultry farm, even then the respondent No.2-Tehsildar
issued a notice for shifting of the poultry farm without extending a
reasonable opportunity of hearing to the petitioner. He, therefore,
prays that the writ petition may kindly be allowed and the
impugned notice dated 09.09.2016 may be quashed and set aside.
Per contra, learned counsel for the respondents submits that
the petitioner is running a poultry farm in contravention of the
provisions of Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act,
1974. Learned counsel further submits that an inspection was
conducted at the poultry farm of the petitioner and certain
deficiencies were pointed out but the said deficiencies were not
removed.     He further submits that the notice issued by the
Tehsildar for shifting of the poultry farm from the existing place
was just and proper.
I have considered the submissions made at the Bar and gone
through the notice dated 09.09.2016 as well as other relevant
records of the case.
The petitioner is running the poultry farm in Village Musaliya
since 1998 and for the purpose a “No Objection Certificate” was
issued by the Gram Panchayat, Musaliya in 1998 itself. Although, it
is mentioned in the notice dated 09.09.2016 issued by the
respondent No. 2 that an inspection was conducted by the
(3 of 3)            [CW-10623/2016]
Rajasthan Pollution Control Board and certain deficiencies were
pointed out. It is noted that although the heading of notice is
stated on Annex. 5 dated 09.09.2016 but a direction has been
issued to the petitioner to shift his poultry farm to some other
A bare perusal of the Annex. 5 dated 09.09.2016 shows that
the petitioner has not been extended any opportunity of hearing
before passing the notice impugned. This Court feels that since
the notice impugned 09.09.2016 having evil consequences, an
opportunity of hearing is required to be given to the petitioner.
In the facts and circumstances of the case, the present writ
petition is disposed of with a direction to the petitioner to appear
before respondent No. 2-Tehsildar within a period of ten days from
today and submit a detailed representation supporting his case.
The respondent No. 2 shall consider the same and decide the
representation    of  the   petitioner     after giving a  reasonable
opportunity of hearing to him. Needless to say that the respondent
No. 2 shall decide the representation by reasoned and speaking
The interim order granted by this Court on 17.09.2016 shall
continue till the respondent No. 2 decide the representation of the
