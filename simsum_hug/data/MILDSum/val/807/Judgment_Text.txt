2.    The petitioner is a Company namely Antique Art Export Private

Limited, engaged in the business of manufacturing, selling and exporting
carpets, rugs etc. The petitioner has been availing insurance policies from
Company”). It is the case of the petitioner that it was approached by the
respondent company through its Administrative Officer, Mr. Pramod
Arora for renewal of expiring policies on terms and conditions to cover its
Factory situated at 78, Kilo Mile Stone, Karhans Village, Main Gt Road,
Samlakha, Panipat. The insurance policies since inception in 1991 are
being renewed and the applicable premium were being paid regularly.
3.     The petitioner availed/renewed Standard Fire and - Special Peril
Policies bearing Policy No.(s)- 040700/11/13/11/00000194, 040700/l
l/13/11/00000195 and 040700/11/13/1100000391, under which insurance
cover was provided against fire, lightning, natural disasters respectively.
The total amount ₹ 18.02 crore were under the policies of insurance cover.
These insurance policies were availed on June 29, 2013 and October 09,
2013, respectively.
4.     On September 25, 2013, the first fire (First Fire Incident) took place
in the Factory of the petitioner, situated at 78, Kilo Mile Stone, Karhans
Village, Main GT Road, Samalakha, Panipat, due to short circuit. As per
the petitioner, it had suffered huge financial losses, crippling its business
and bringing the entire business operations to a standstill. After the first
fire incident, representatives of the Surveyor visited the factory of the
petitioner and inspected the factory. Thereafter, on October 25, 2013,
second fire took place in the factory of the petitioner. The incident of fire
and the loss incurred thereof by the petitioner were reported to the
respondent company, who appointed M/s Protocol Surveyors & Loss
Assessors Pvt. Ltd. as the Surveyors and Assessors (‘Surveyor’, for short)
ARB.P. 163/2022 & ARB.P. 164/2022                               Page 3 of 38
5.     The respondent company sent an e-mail to the petitioner with
intimation that it had approved the claim for an amount of ₹ 2,81,44 413/-
, on account of fire incident dated October 25, 2013 towards full and final
settlement. With regard to the first fire incident the claim was settled for
₹2,20,36,840/-. It was the case of the respondent that the both the claims
were accepted by the petitioner without any demur or protest, resulting in
discharge of claims in respect of the incidents dated September 25, 2013
and October 25, 2013. Thereafter, on July 27, 2016 the petitioner herein,
claimed fraud, coercion and undue influence.
6.     Thereafter, the petitioner approached this Court in Arbitration
Petition Nos. 104/105 of 2017, seeking appointment of Arbitrator to
adjudicate the disputes with respect to the claims. This court vide order
dated May 30, 2017, allowed the Petition and appointed a sole arbitrator,
7.     The respondent company herein, filed Special Leave Petitions
against the order dated May 30, 2017. The Supreme Court in United India
Insurance Company Limited v. Antique Arts Exports Pvt Ltd., Civil
Appeal Nos. 3284/2019 and 3285/2019, (‘Antique Art Export’ for short)
vide a Common Judgment and Order dated March 28, 2019, allowed the
appeals and held that, no arbitrable dispute subsists between the parties
and set aside the order passed by this court appointing the Arbitrator.
Aggrieved by the said Judgment and Order, the petitioner sought review
of the same. The Review Petitions were dismissed by the Supreme Court
in Antique Arts Exports Pvt. Ltd. v. United India Insurance Co. Ltd.,
Review Petition No(s). 1406/07 of 2019 (‘Antique Arts Exports2’, for
short) vide common Order dated July 10, 2019.
8.     It is stated the Judgment passed by the two Judge bench of the
Supreme Court of India in Antique Art Export (supra), was overruled by
the three Judge bench of the Supreme Court vide Judgment dated
September 05, 2019 in M/s. Mayavati Trading Pvt. Ltd. v. Pradyuat Deb
Burman in Civil Appeal No. 7023 of 2019.
9.     In view of the law laid down by the three Judge bench of the
Supreme Court in M/s. Mayavati Trading Pvt. Ltd. (supra), the petitioner
approached this Court seeking benefit of law as laid down in the said
Judgment again praying for the appointment of an Arbitrator.
10.    Mr. Manish Kaushik, the learned counsel for the petitioner state
that, despite being well aware about the genuineness of the claims, the
appointed surveyor of the respondent company did not process the claims
of the petitioner and kept delaying the same in violation of various legal
precedents and IRDAI (Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority
of India) Circulars and Regulations. He also stated that the respondent
company further attempted to delay and willfully delay the processing of
the claims by appointing an Investigator being, M/s.JSR Surveyors (P)
Ltd. (hereinafter referred as the ‘Investigator’), who did not visit the
factory for the longest time. The said investigator acting through its
Director, Mr. S.K. Agarwal, was appointed only after the second fire
incident, which took place in the factory of the petitioner on October 25,
11.    He stated that the petitioner has suffered major losses with respect
to burning of raw materials being finished and semi-finished goods etc.
and was in dire financial straits. He also stated that the petitioner requested
the respondent company; its surveyor and investigator to release the
interim payment vide numerous letters and correspondences. However,
ARB.P. 163/2022 & ARB.P. 164/2022                                  Page 5 of 38
there was no response to the same on the part of the respondent company.
12.    He submitted that the petitioner vide its letter dated August 11,
2014, clarified every issue/query raised by the surveyor and the
investigator along with all documents, records etc. Thereafter, the
respondent company did not communicate to the petitioner about the
status of the claims for over two and half years. He stated that, despite
petitioner regularly requesting the respondent company for the
Preliminary and Final Survey Reports, it was only provided to the
petitioner on August 26, 2016. He also stated that the petitioner was forced
into signing a discharge voucher by the respondent company by the use of
unfair coercive bargaining power in their favor.
13.    He submitted that the petitioner realized from the Final Survey
Reports dated July 29, 2015, that the Surveyor had vide his Interim Report
dated February 20, 2014 had recommended that an on-account payment
of ₹ 1.65 crore be released to the petitioner. However for reasons best
known to the respondent company, the advice of the surveyor was totally
neglected. He stated that the respondent company withheld the Final
Survey Report for more than a year, which is in clear violation of the
IRDAI Regulations and Circulars.
14.    He stated that, for the first fire claim a payment of ₹3, 46, 41,970/-
and for the second fire claim, payment of ₹ 6,33,48,302/- were approved
by the surveyor vide their office memo dated August 04, 2015. However,
for the sole motive of minimizing the claim amount of the petitioner, the
respondent company, belatedly appointed another Investigator and acted
in collusion with the said Investigator.
15.    He stated that, one of the main reasons behind being compelled into
signing the discharge voucher was that the petitioner was suffering from
ARB.P. 163/2022 & ARB.P. 164/2022                                Page 6 of 38
severe financial burden and the insurance claim was pending for
settlement with the respondent company for a very long time. The
handling of the claim of the petitioner clearly depicts mala-fides and
unfairness on the part of the respondent company. He stated that petitioner
was compelled, forced and coerced to pre-sign and submit a discharge
voucher dated June 24, 2016 to the respondent company as a condition for
release of money amounting to ₹ 2,20,36,840/- in lieu of settlement of
claim for first fire that took place on September 25, 2013, against the total
claim of ₹ 5,12,49,241/-. He stated that the petitioner was also compelled
to pre-sign and submit a discharge voucher dated May 05, 2016 for the
second fire that took place on October 25, 2013 to the respondent company
as a condition for release of money amounting to the tune of ₹
2,81,44,413/- in lieu of settlement of claim against the claim of ₹
16.    He submitted that the petitioner vide its letter dated July 27, 2016
rescinded to the purported Discharge Voucher as illegal and void and the
petitioner in the said letter, called upon the respondent company to pay the
balance amounts in respect of the claims, but the letter was never replied
to by the respondent company.
17.    He contended, there could not have been any Accord and
Satisfaction or consensus as, till that date the petitioner was not even
supplied with the Survey Reports, Investigation Report. Even the basis
and break up under different heads were supplied to the petitioner only on
August 26, 2016. He stated that the purported Discharge Voucher does not
reflect any accord or satisfaction of the claims of the petitioner. He also
stated that the petitioner vide the said letter dated July 27, 2016, called
upon the respondent to pay the balance amount of ₹2,92,12,401/- for the
ARB.P. 163/2022 & ARB.P. 164/2022                              Page 7 of 38
first fire incident and balance amount of ₹7,86,59,526/- for the second
fire incident with an interest at 18% per annum but the letter was never
replied to by the respondent company.
18.     The Petitioner thereafter served a letter dated September 09, 2016,
upon the respondent company invoking the arbitration under clause 13 of
the Insurance Policy. He stated that the respondent Company failed to
agree to the appointment of an Arbitrator.
19.     He submitted that, thereafter, the petitioner approached this court
under Section 11(6) of the Act of 1996, seeking appointment of arbitrator
to adjudicate the dispute with respect to the claim amounts between the
parties. This court order dated May 30, 2017, appointed a Sole Arbitrator,
20.     He stated that the respondent company therein filed a Special Leave
Petitions challenging the order dated May 30, 2017 passed by this Court,
wherein the Supreme Court vide a Common Judgment and Order dated
March 28, 2019, in Antique Art Export (supra), took a view contrary to
section 11 (6)(A), and consequently, the appeals filed by the respondent
company were allowed holding that, no arbitrable dispute subsists
between the parties and thereby set aside the Orders passed by the this
court dated May 30, 2017.
21.     He submitted that the petitioner thereafter filed a Review Petition
No(s). 1406/07 of 2019 before the Supreme Court, seeking review of
common Judgment and Order dated March 28, 2019, passed in Antique
Art Export (supra). The said Review Petitions were dismissed by the
Supreme Court vide common Order dated July10, 2019.
22.     He submitted that, a three judge bench of the Supreme Court in the
matter titled M/s. Mayavati Trading Pvt Ltd (supra) considered the
ARB.P. 163/2022 & ARB.P. 164/2022                              Page 8 of 38
correct interpretation of Section 11 (6)(A) and the correctness in Antique
Art Export (supra). He stated that while dismissing M/s. Mayavati
Trading Pvt Ltd (supra),the three Judge bench held as under:
“(7) Prior to Section 11 (6A), this Court in several judgments
beginning with SBP & Co. vs. Patel Engineering Ltd. and
Anr.(2005) 8 SCC 618 has held that at the stage of a Sectio11
11 (6)application being filed, the Court need not merely
confine itself to the examination of the existence of an
arbitration agreement but could also go into certain
preliminary questions such as stale claims, accord a11d
satisfaction having been reached etc.”
10) This being the position, it is clear that the law prior to
the2015 Amendment that has been laid down by this Court,
which would have included going into whether accord and
satisfaction has take11 place, has now been legislatively
overruled. This being the position, it is difficult to agree with
the reasoning contained in the aforesaid judgment as Section
11 (6A) is confined to the examination of the existence of an
arbitration agreement and is to be understood in the narrow
sense as has been laid down in Para 48 & 59 ill the judgment
11) We, therefore, overrule the judgment in United India
Insurance Company Limited (supra) as not having laid down
the correct law but dismiss this appeal for the reason given
in Para 3 above.”
23.    He stated, that the two Judge bench of the Supreme Court in
Antique Arts Export (supra), has been overruled by the three Judge bench
of the Supreme Court in M/s. Mayavati Trading Pvt. Ltd. (supra), for not
having laid down the correct position of law, i.e., in view of Section 11
(6) (A) of the Act of 1996. The Courts while considering an application
for appointment of arbitrator under Section 11, are confined to the
examination of the existence of an arbitration agreement. He further stated
that the existence of arbitration agreement/clause is admitted by the parties
ARB.P. 163/2022 & ARB.P. 164/2022                                  Page 9 of 38
in the present matter and as per the interpretation rendered in M/s.
Mayavati Trading Co. Pvt. Ltd. (supra), the issue of appointment of an
arbitrator to adjudicate disputes between the parties is still subsisting. The
benefit of the law as laid down in the matter M/s. Mayavati Trading Pvt.
Ltd. (supra) need to be given to the petitioner.
24.    He submitted that the petitioner is entitled to invoke Arbitration as
per clause 13 of the Insurance Policy. He argued that the signing of the
Discharge Voucher by the petitioner was done because its rights are
protected under Clause 13 of the Insurance Policy and the Parliament has
mandated that wherever possible, cases should be referred to arbitration
for early disposal.
25.     Furthermore, he submitted that the adjudication by arbitral tribunal
is a continuing right, and commences from Section 21 notice under the
Act of 1996 and continue till valid and binding award is rendered. The
right of appointment of arbitrator and adjudication by Arbitral Tribunal
continues on termination of mandate such as under Section 14 or Section
15 and even after setting aside of an award under section 34, when the
parties are remanded back to Arbitral Tribunal.
26.    He stated that, it has been settled by the Supreme Court that a Full
and Final Settlement does not vitiate the arbitration clause and thus, the
petitioner is completely entitled to arbitration. In support, he has placed
reliance upon Damodar Valley Corporation v. K.K. Kar ., AIR 1974 SC
158, wherein the Supreme Court held that the questions of unilateral
repudiation of the rights and obligations under the contract or of a full and
final settlement of the contract relate to the performance or discharge of
the contract. Far from putting an end to the arbitration clause, they fall
within the purview of it. Repudiation by one party alone does not
ARB.P. 163/2022 & ARB.P. 164/2022                                 Page 10 of 38
terminate the contract. It takes two to end it, and hence it follows that as
the contract subsists for the determination of the rights and obligations of
the parties, the arbitration clause also survives.
27.    He has also relied in the matter of Union of India (UOI) v.
Kishorilal Gupta and Bros., AIR 1959 SC 1362, wherein the Supreme
Court held that a dispute whether the obligations under a contract have
been discharged by an accord and satisfaction is no less a dispute
regarding the obligations under the contract. Such a dispute has to be
settled by arbitration if it is within the scope of arbitration clause and either
party wants that to be done.
28.    Furthermore, Mr. Kaushik stated that the procedure/judicial process
under Section 11 for appointment of arbitrator are not justiciable,
particularly in view of Section 11(6)(A), even though the exercise of
power is judicial. The forum under Section 11(6) is not a Court, and thus
there is no decision on merits while appointing an arbitrator. Since there
is no decision on merits, res judicata would not apply, furthermore, there
can be no res judicata on erroneous decision and inherent lack of
29.    He stated that the Section 11 applications are not said to be made to
a ‘Court’ as contemplated under Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996,
in support of his statement he relied on judgments as under:-
1. Rodemadan India Limited v. International Trade Expo
2. State of West Bengal v. Associated Contractors; AIR 2015
3. Debdas Routh and Ors. v. Hinduja Leyland Finance Limited
and Ors.; 2018 4 CALLT57(HC);
4. Ravi Ranjan Developers Pvt. Ltd. v. Aditya Kumar
ARB.P. 163/2022 & ARB.P. 164/2022                                   Page 11 of 38
30.    Furthermore, he placed his reliance on Khazana Projects &
Industries Pvt. Ltd. v. Indian Oil Corporation Limited., FMA No.
2748/2016; wherein it was held that a clear proposition of law is that
section 42 is not attracted by virtue of the appellant having filed an
application under section 11 of the Act before the Delhi High Court since
an application under section 11 is not made to a "court" within the
definition of section 2(1)(e).
31.    He had also placed his reliance on Afcons Infrastructure Limited
v. Konkan Railway Corporation Limited, Arb. P.No. 10/2019; wherein it
was held that the Supreme Court or High Court or its delegate while
exercising power under section 11 of the Act cannot be equated with the
“Court” contemplated by section 42 of the Act, 1996 which has a definite
and exhaustive meaning under section 2(1)(e) of the Act, 1996.
32.    He stated that the principles of res-judicata as envisaged under
Section 11, Civil Procedure Code of 1908, can have no applicability in the
present case, as under the proceedings of Section 11 (6)(A), there is no
final adjudication or determination nor hearing or disposal of the matter
on merits. He placed reliance on Canara Bank v NG Subbaraya
Setty&Anr., Civil Appeal No.4233/2018, wherein it is stated there are
certain notable exceptions to the application of the doctrine. One well
known exception is that the doctrine cannot impart finality to an erroneous
decision on the jurisdiction of a Court. Likewise, an erroneous judgment
on a question of law, which sanctions something that is illegal, also cannot
be allowed to operate as res judicata.”
33.    He has also placed reliance on Municipal Corporation of Delhi v.
Gurnam Kaur, AIR 1989 SC 38; wherein it was held that, if a matter is
decided was without argument, without reference to the crucial words of
ARB.P. 163/2022 & ARB.P. 164/2022                              Page 12 of 38
the Rule and without any citation of authority, it is not binding and would
not be followed.
34.    He stated that the overruled decision does not enjoy the force of law
under Article141 of the Constitution of India; rather the latest and larger
bench decision of Supreme Court enjoys the force of law under Article
141 of the Constitution of India as held in Ramdas Bhikaji Chaudhari v.
Sadanand and Ors., AIR 1980 SC 126, as under;-
“5…..It is well settled that whenever a previous decision is
over-ruled by a larger bench the previous decision is
completely wiped out and Article 141 will have no
application to the decision which has already been over-
ruled, and the court would have to decide the case according
to law laid down by the latest decision of this Court and not
by the decision which has been expressly overruled.”
35.    He also stated that a wrong interpretation of law or incorrect
position of law cannot prejudice any person and the petitioner cannot be
prejudiced today for a continuing cause of action by an interpretation
which has been overruled retrospectively. In support of his submission he
has relied on Assistant Commissioner, Income Tax, Rajkot v. Saurashtra
Kutch Stock Exchange Ltd. (2008)14 SCC 171, wherein the Supreme
Court held the overruling of a previous decision is a declaration that the
supposed rule never was law.
36.    He stated that, when the court lacks inherent jurisdiction in passing
an order, an order passed by such court would be non est in law and void-
ab initio. A defect of jurisdiction goes to the root of the matter and strikes
at the very authority of the court to make an order. An order passed by a
court having no jurisdiction is a nullity in law. It is further stated that when
an order is a nullity, it cannot be supported by invoking the procedural
principles like, estoppels, waiver and res-judicata.
ARB.P. 163/2022 & ARB.P. 164/2022                                   Page 13 of 38
37.    He has relied upon in Dwarka Prasad Agarwal (D) By LR’s and
Anr. v. BD Agarwal and Ors. AIR 2003 SC 2686, it was held by the
Supreme Court of India that, it is well-settled that an order passed by a
court without jurisdiction is a nullity and any order passed or action taken
pursuant thereto or in furtherance thereof would also be nullities. He also
has relied on Allahabad Development Authority v. Nasiruzzaman and
Ors., (1996) 6 SCC 424., wherein it is held the previous decision which
was found to be erroneous on its face, it does not operate a res judicata.
In this regard he has relied on the judgment of the Supreme Court in Ashok
Leyland v. State of Tamil Nadu and Ors., AIR 2004 SC 2836., wherein
it was held that the principle of res judicata is a procedural provision and
a jurisdictional question if wrongly decided would not attract the principle
of res judicata. When an order is passed without jurisdiction, the same
becomes a nullity. When an order is a nullity, it cannot be supported by
invoking the procedural principles like, estoppel, waiver or res judicata.
38.    He has also relied on the following judgments; Ramnik Vallabhdas
Madhvaniand Ors. v. Taraben Pravinlal Madhvani., (2004) 1 SCC 497,
Mathura Prasad Bajoo Jaiswal and Ors. v. Dossibai NB Jeejeebhoy.,
AIR 1971 SC 2355; Balvant N Viswamitra and Ors. v. Yadav Sadashiv
Mule (Dead) through Lrs and Ors., (2004) 8 SCC 706; Kishore v. State
39.    He stated that the question, whether full and final settlement has
taken place or not, is a question that can be left to the arbitrator to decide.
He has relied upon Bharat Heavy Electricals Ltd. v. Amar Nath Bhan
Prakash [1982 GLH 390] and Vidya Drolia and Ors. v. Durga Trading
Corporation and Ors., (2021) 2 SCC 1., wherein, the Supreme Court held
ARB.P. 163/2022 & ARB.P. 164/2022                                 Page 14 of 38
“A claim for arbitration cannot be rejected merely or solely
on the ground that the settlement agreement or discharge
voucher had been executed if its validity is disputed”. .
40.    He has also relied on the judgment of the Supreme Court in the case
of Union of India v. Pradeep Vinod Constructions Company and Ors.;
2020 (1)ALT 156., wherein it was held that the plea of No Claim
Certificate is an issue for the arbitrator to consider by looking at the claim
of the Respondent(s) and the stand of the Appellant railways. This
contention raised by the parties was left open to be raised before the
41.    In support of his argument, Mr. Kaushik has also relied on the
judgment of the Supreme Court in the case of The Oriental Insurance
Company Limited and Ors. v. Dicitex Furnishing Limited.,(2020) 4 SCC
621; for similar proposition.
42.    Mr. Kaushik stated that the practice of furnishing Discharge
Voucher before releasing the claim amount on the part of the Insurance
Company is unfair and unethical; he stated that the complete abuse of the
coercive bargaining power subsists with the respondent Insurance
Company. He has relied upon the judgments of Worldfa Exports Pvt. Ltd.
India Insurance v. Ajmer Singh Cotton & General Mills and Ors. AIR
1999 SC 3027, United India Insurance Company Limited and Ors. v.
Manubhai Dharmasinhbhai Gajera and Ors. AIR 2009 SC 461, Central
Inland Water Transport Corporation Limited and Ors. v. Brojo Nath
Ganguly and Ors. AIR 1986 SC 1571, United India Insurance Co. Ltd.
43.    He has submitted there are various judgments of the Supreme Court,
ARB.P. 163/2022 & ARB.P. 164/2022                                Page 15 of 38
this Court and the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission,
wherein, the courts have taken judicial notice of the plea of coercion and
fraud practiced by the Insurance Companies to compel the insured to give
discharge vouchers. He stated that the Courts and Commission have also
directed the IRDAI to make regulations in this regard as well as
discouraged the Insurance Companies from continuance of such arbitrary
and unlawful practice. He has placed reliance the following judgments;-
Oriental Insurance Co. Ltd. v. Government Tool Room and Training
Centre, (2008) CPJ 267 (NC); National Insurance Company Limited v.
Abhoy Shankar Tewari, Revision Petition No. 555 of 2015.
44.    He stated that the respondent company being a “State” under the
definition of Article 12, is bound to act in a fair and reasonable manner
but the same was not followed by the respondent company as they got the
Discharge Voucher signed from the petitioner under fraud, coercion,
misrepresentation and use of coercive bargaining power. He stated that the
respondent company acted in deviation of the Principles of reasonableness
and fairness. He has placed reliance on United India Insurance Company
v. Narinder Mohan Arya, (1994) 107 PLR 244, wherein, the Supreme
Court and the courts below, held the respondent / Insurance Company to
be a “State” under the meaning of Article 12 of the Constitution of India.
45.    He has relied on Kumari Shrilekha Vidyarthi and Ors. v. State of
U.P. and Ors., AIR 1991 SC 537, whereby the Supreme Court held that
the requirement of Article 14 being the duty to act fairly, justly and
reasonably, there is nothing which militates against the concept of
requiring the State always to so act, even in contractual matters. There is
a basic difference between the acts of the State which must invariably be
ARB.P. 163/2022 & ARB.P. 164/2022                             Page 16 of 38
46.    He stated that, fraud was committed against the petitioner by the
respondent company. It is only one Surveyor appointed for both the
claims namely, M/s Protocol Surveyors & Loss Assessors Pvt. Ltd., and
thus, there being a singular assessor in both the fire claims and the
Surveyor had approved payment. The same was recommended by DO-7
to Regional Office vide their office memo dated August 04, 2015. He
stated that the assessment of Surveyors would have also been much higher
but the Investigator tried to confuse and delay the claim process by various
unhealthy practices including blaming the Surveyor. The Investigator was
working with a negative frame of mind right from the very beginning with
a sole objective of either to reject the claim or reduce it to the absolute
minimum. He also stated that the petitioner was clearly eligible for the
payment as recommended and passed by the appointed Surveyor but the
respondent company fraudulently in connivance with the Investigator
reduced this amount to the absolute, as the petitioner was never provided
with the basic details of claim process and amount.
47.    He stated that, it is amply clear that the respondent company has
disregarded the Surveyor’s Findings regarding the loss assessment
without assigning any cogent reason. He stated that the deviation from the
Surveyor’s report without assigning cogent reasons on behalf of the
respondent company is completely perverse, illegal and against the law.
In support of his contention he has relied upon National Insurance
Company Limited v. Sri Chakravarthi Enterprises Limited, Revision
Petition 3053 of 2007; and United India Insurance Company Limited v.
Lt. Col. Randhawa Singh, Revision Petition No. 2767 of 2011.
48.    He also stated that on the question of fraud the Supreme Court in
ARB.P. 163/2022 & ARB.P. 164/2022                              Page 17 of 38
N.N. Global Mercantile Private Limited v. Indo Unique Flame Limited
and Ors., 2021 (1) ARBLR 533 (SC), held that the question of fraud is
arbitrable and can be referred to an arbitrator for the purpose of
adjudication. He has also placed reliance on Deccan Paper Mills Co. Ltd.
v. Regency Mahavir Properties and Ors., AIR 2020 SC 4047, wherein
the Supreme Court held that merely because a particular transaction may
have criminal overtones as well, does not mean that its subject matter
becomes non-arbitrable.
49.    He stated that no detail/documents were provided to the petitioner
about the settlement of claims in spite of the petitioner’s regular and
repeated reminders. He stated that the Investigator’s Reports are still not
provided to the petitioner, which just throws light on the gravity and
seriousness of the situation. The petitioner had also requested the
respondent company to provide the basis of the settlement of claim but
unfortunately, the same has still not been received by the Petitioner.
50.    He submitted that the letter of subrogation was never given by the
petitioner as well as no consent letter was ever given by the petitioner prior
to the signing of discharge voucher on the dotted lines, as demanded by
the respondent company. The Discharge Voucher furnished by the
petitioner was under compelling and coercive circumstances.
51.    He stated that no money has been paid by the respondent company
for the raw materials. He stated that in the email dated May 05, 2016 and
June 24, 2016, no claim amount is mentioned about raw materials whereas
substantial amount of loss on the account of the fire was in lieu of raw
material. He also stated that the respondent company deliberately removed
it from the claim amount which amounts to an act of fraud.
52.    He stated that the manufacturing unit of the petitioner cannot be
ARB.P. 163/2022 & ARB.P. 164/2022                               Page 18 of 38
insured without insurance of raw materials, and that within 3 weeks time
from release of payment of 1st claim (being 2 months after payment of 2nd
claim), the petitioner raised protest vide letter dated July 27, 2016 for
claiming the balance amount on account of deficient service and against
the mala-fide intensions of the respondent company and rescinded the
purported discharge vouchers as being illegal and void. He also states that
till July 06, 2016, the petitioner was under the clutches of respondent
company when they released the payment of 1st Claim of fire that took
place on September 25, 2013, if the petitioner would have raised the
protest before receiving of payment in his account, it could have been
stopped by the respondent company. Therefore, the petitioner had to wait
till the time payment was received in his account and then only, the
petitioner could have raised the protest for claiming the balance claim
53.     He submitted that the mala-fide intentions of respondent company
are itself proved by the fact that they released the part payment of 2nd claim
earlier to the part payment of 1st fire claim.
54.     He submitted that the contest of the petitioner to the settlement by
the respondent company was within 21 days of the settlement of first claim
,i.e., the first claim dated September 25, 2013, discharge voucher was
signed on June 24, 2016 and payment was received on July 06, 2016, for
the second claim dated October 25, 2013,discharge voucher was signed
on May 05, 2016 and payment was released on May 13, 2016. Hence, the
petitioner could only contest the payments of claim, post receipt of part
payment of both the claims, till receipt of payment under both the claims,
the process was in continuation and the contest before would have blocked
even the compensation payment admitted to be payable by the respondent
ARB.P. 163/2022 & ARB.P. 164/2022                               Page 19 of 38
55.    He stated that as per Section 11 (6)(A) as inserted by the Arbitration
and Conciliation (Amendment) Act, 2015, the power of the court has now
been restricted only to examination of the existence of an arbitration
agreement. He has relied on Duro Felguera, S.A. v. Gangavaram Port
Ltd., (2017) 9 SCC 729, wherein the Supreme Court interpreted Section
11 (6) (A) to hold that the Courts are required to only look into one aspect
being the “existence of an arbitration agreement”.
56.    Mr. Kaushik also relied on Uttarakhand Purv Sainik Kalyan
Nigam Limited v. Northern Coal Field Limited, AIR 2020 SC 979;
wherein, it is held that the doctrine of "Kompetenz-Kompetenz", also
referred to as "Compètence-Compètence", or "Compètence de la
recognized", implies that the arbitral tribunal is empowered and has the
competence to Rule on its own jurisdiction, including determining all
jurisdictional issues, and the existence or validity of the arbitration
agreement. This doctrine is intended to minimize judicial intervention, so
that the arbitral process is not thwarted at the threshold, when a
preliminary objection is raised by one of the parties.
57.    He submitted that the three Judge bench of the Supreme Court in
the matter titled M/s. Mayavati Trading Pvt. Ltd. (supra) had an occasion
to consider the correct interpretation of Section11 (6) (A) and the
correctness of the order dated March 28, 2019 in the matter. He stated
that the law is well settled on the aspect that whenever a previous decision
is overruled by a larger bench, the previous decision is completely wiped
out and negated.
58.    He submitted that the manner in which the claim of the Petitioner
was handled is completely against the IRDAI (Protection of Policyholders
ARB.P. 163/2022 & ARB.P. 164/2022                               Page 20 of 38
Interests) Regulations, 2017 and the established procedure of settling
insurance claims. He also submitted that clause 15 of the IRDAI
(Protection of Policyholders Interests) Regulations, 2017 highlights upon
the procedure in which the claims are to be settled, however, the
respondent company has acted in a manner being contrary to the
established procedure of law.
59.    He stated that the Legal Maxim “Necessitates Non Habet Legem”
meaning thereby that “Necessity Knows no Law” squarely applies to the
present case in hand and the Discharge Vouchers were issued by the
respondent company in unfair use of its coercive bargaining power and
that further such compelling circumstances were made out by the
Respondent Insurance Company under which the Petitioner had no other
option but to sign on the dotted lines. He has relied upon the Ambika
Construction v. Union of India, (2006) 13 SCC 475 and Chairman and
MD, NTPC Limited v. Reshmi Constructions, (2004) 2 SCC 663,
wherein the Supreme Court recognized the Legal Maxim “Necessitates
Non Habet Legem” and applied the same.
60.     Mr. Kaushik stated the prayer as made in the petition be granted
and an Arbitrator be appointed for adjudication of disputes between the
61.    Mr. Amit Kumar Singh, the learned counsel for the respondent
company stated that on June 24, 2016, the petitioner willingly accepted ₹
2, 20, 36,840 in lieu of settlement of claim for fire that took place on
September 25, 2013 and ₹2, 81, 44,413/- in lieu of the settlement of claim
for the fire that took place in October 25, 2013.
62.    He stated that on receipt, the petitioner on its own free will executed
a discharge voucher on the said date itself and vide letter dated July 27,
ARB.P. 163/2022 & ARB.P. 164/2022                                 Page 21 of 38
2016, the petitioner lodged its protest against the execution of the
discharge voucher and demanded balance amount of ₹2,92,12,401/- and ₹
63.    He submitted in the earlier round of litigation, the Supreme Court
allowed the appeals filed by the respondent company and concluded as
“In the instant case, prima facie no dispute subsisted after
the discharge voucher being signed by the respondent
without any demur or protest and claim being finally settled
with accord and satisfaction and after 11 weeks of the
settlement of claim a letter was sent on 27th July 2016 for the
first time raising a voice in the form of protest that the
discharge voucher was signed under undue influence and
coercion with no supportive prima facie evidence being
placed on record in the absence thereof, it must follow that
the claim had been settled with accord and satisfaction
leaving no arbitral dispute subsisting under the agreement to
be referred to the arbitrator for adjudication In our
considered view, the High Court has committed a manifest
error in passing the impugned order and adopting a
mechanical process in appointing the Arbitrator without any
supportive evidence on record to prima facie substantiate
that an arbitral dispute subsisted under the agreement which
needed to be referred to the arbitrator for adjudication.”
64.    He stated that mere over-ruling of the principles, on which the
earlier judgment was passed, by a subsequent judgment of higher forum
will not have the effect of uprooting the final adjudication between the
parties and set it at naught. He also stated that with the dismissal of the
Review Petition, the inter-se dispute between the parties has attained
finality on July 10, 2019.
65.    He has placed reliance on the Judgment of the Supreme Court in the
case of Neelima Srivastava v. State of Uttar Pradesh and Ors., 2021 SCC
OnLine SC 610, wherein the Supreme Court held as under;-
ARB.P. 163/2022 & ARB.P. 164/2022                               Page 22 of 38
“30. It becomes absolutely clear from the above clarification
that earlier decisions running counter to the principles settled
in the decision of Umadevi (3) will not be treated as
precedents. It cannot mean that the judgment of a competent
Court delivered prior to the decision in Umadevi (3) and
which has attained finality and is binding inter se between the
parties need not be implemented. Mere over-ruling of the
principles, on which the earlier judgment was passed, by a
subsequent judgment of higher forum will not have the effect
of uprooting the final adjudication between the parties and
set it at naught. There is a distinction between over-ruling a
principle and reversal of the judgment. The judgment in
question itself has to be assailed and got rid of in a manner
known to or recognized by law. Mereover-ruling of the
principles by a subsequent judgment will not dilute the
binding effect of the decision on inter- parties.”
66.    He submitted that the present petitions are filed 3 years after the
dismissal of the review petitions are clearly as an afterthought and an
abuse of the process of law and pleads for dismissal of the petition with
67.    Having heard the learned counsel for the parties and perused the
record, the initial issue which arises for consideration is whether the
present petitions shall be maintainable in view of the fact that the
petitioner had already filed petitions seeking appointment of Arbitrator,
which though allowed by this Court vide order dated May 30, 2017 but on
a challenge by the respondent herein, before the Supreme Court by way of
Special Leave Petitions (which were converted into Civil Appeals being
CA No. 3284/2019 and 3285/2019, namely, Antique Art Export(supra))
have been allowed, vide a common judgment and order dated March 28,
2019, wherein it was held that, no arbitrable dispute subsists between the
parties, resulting in the Supreme Court setting aside the order of this Court
ARB.P. 163/2022 & ARB.P. 164/2022                                Page 23 of 38
appointing the Arbitrator.      Even the Review Petitions filed by the
petitioner herein seeking review of common judgment and order of the
Supreme Court dated March 28, 2019, were dismissed by the Supreme
Court on July 10, 2019.
68.    The submission of Mr. Kaushik was, in view of the fact that the
judgment in Antique Art Export (supra) having been overruled in M/s.
Mayavati Trading Pvt. Ltd. (supra), the doctrine of res judicata is not
applicable. According to him, as per the judgment relied upon by him, the
judgment of the Supreme Court in Antique Art Export (supra) is
erroneous / without jurisdiction, in view of Section 11(6)(A) of the Act of
1996, and the same is not binding even between the parties inter-se.
69.    I am not impressed by the said submission. It is true that the
judgment in the case of Antique Art Export (supra) has been overruled
by three Judge Bench of Supreme Court in the case of M/s. Mayavati
Trading Pvt. Ltd. (supra) but the fact remains, the dispute / issue inter-se
parties with regard to the appointment of Arbitrator has attained finality
with the decision of the Supreme Court in Antique Art Export (supra),
hence, the present petitions shall be barred by principle of res judicata.
70.     This I say so, even the proceedings under Section 11 of the Act of
1996, shall be governed by the principle of res judicata, in view of the
judgment of the Supreme Court in the case of Anil, S/o Jagannath Rana
& Ors. v. Rajendra. S/o Radhakrishan Rana and Ors., (2015) 2 SCC
583, wherein in paragraphs 13, 15 and 16, the Supreme Court held as
“13. In Satyadhyan Ghosal v. Deorajin Debi [AIR 1960 SC
941], this principle was discussed in detail and it has been
settled as follows. To quote: (AIR pp. 943-44, paras 7-8)
ARB.P. 163/2022 & ARB.P. 164/2022                              Page 24 of 38
“7. The principle of res judicata is based on the need of
giving a finality to judicial decisions. What it says is that
once a res is judicata, it shall not be adjudged again.
Primarily it applies as between past litigation and future
litigation. When a matter—whether on a question of fact
or a question of law—has been decided between two
parties in one suit or proceeding and the decision is final,
either because no appeal was taken to a higher court or
because the appeal was dismissed, or no appeal lies,
neither party will be allowed in a future suit or proceeding
between the same parties to canvass the matter again. This
principle of res judicata is embodied in relation to suits in
Section 11 of the Code of Civil Procedure; but even where
Section 11 does not apply, the principle of res judicata has
been applied by courts for the purpose of achieving finality
in litigation. The result of this is that the original court as
well as any higher court must in any future litigation
proceed on the basis that the previous decision was
correct.
8. The principle of res judicata applies also as between two
stages in the same litigation to this extent that a court,
whether the trial court or a higher court having at an
earlier stage decided a matter in one way will not allow
the parties to reagitate the matter again at a subsequent
stage of the same proceedings.
15. The principles as discussed above on res judicata have been
consistently followed by this Court. And the recent judgments
in that regard are in Subramanian Swamy v. State of T.N and
in Surjit Singh v. Gurwant Kaur. Thus, once the judicial
authority takes a decision not to refer the parties to arbitration,
and the said decision having become final, thereafter Section
11(6) route before the Chief Justice is not available to either
party.
16. With great respect, the Designated Judge has gone wholly
wrong in passing the order under Section 11 of the Act when
the civil court is in seisin of the dispute and where arbitration
has already been declined by the said court.”
ARB.P. 163/2022 & ARB.P. 164/2022                                  Page 25 of 38
71.    The Supreme Court in the case of Neelima Srivastava (supra), has
reiterated the principle in identical fact situation, wherein, in Paragraphs
34 to 36, it held as under:-
“34. In Rupa Ashok Hurra v. Ashok Hurra, while dealing with
an identical issue this Court held that reconsideration of the
judgment of this Court which has attained finality is not
normally permissible. The decision upon a question of law
rendered by this Court was conclusive and would bind the
Court in subsequent cases. The Court cannot sit in appeal
against its own judgment.
35. In Union of India v. Major S.P. Sharma, a three-judge
bench of this Court has held as under:—
“A decision rendered by a competent court cannot be
challenged in collateral proceedings for the reason that
if it is permitted to do so there would be “confusion and
chaos and the finality of proceedings would cease to have
any meaning.”
36. Thus, it is very well settled that it is not permissible for the
parties to re-open the concluded judgments of the Court as the
same may not only tantamount to an abuse of the process of
the Court but would have far reaching adverse effect on the
administration of justice.”
72.    In this regard, I may also reproduce the Judgment of the Supreme
Court in the case of Union of India and Ors. v. Sarawati Marble and
Granite Industries Pvt. Ltd, (2020) 20 SCC 810, wherein it is held as
“5. A neat submission which has been made by Mr A.K.
Sanghi, learned Senior Counsel appearing for the Union
of India, is that no such writ petition to claim refund of
the excise duty, penalty and interest was maintainable
when the proceedings in respect of the respondents had
attained finality and amount recovered. Merely because
this Court in some other judgment, at a subsequent date,
took a different view and settled the position in law, is not
ARB.P. 163/2022 & ARB.P. 164/2022                                   Page 26 of 38
a valid ground available to the respondents to approach
the High Court under Article 226 of the Constitution of
India and claim such a relief.
6. The aforesaid submission is valid and justified in law.
Insofar as the respondents are concerned, the duty was
paid by them after proper adjudication and a particular
view was taken which was upheld by the Tribunal as well.
As mentioned above, no further appeals were brought by
the respondents and, therefore, such proceedings had
attained finality. The order of refund of this amount,
merely because this Court took a different view thereafter
in some other case, would not be permissible. Thus,
insofar as the direction contained in the impugned
judgments to refund the amount of duty, interest and
penalty is concerned, the same is set aside. However,
once this Court has settled the position of law holding that
the aforesaid process would not amount to manufacture,
from the date of the judgment of this Court, the Excise
Department is not entitled to recover any such excise duty
from the respondents.”
73.    In support of the submissions on the maintainability of the petitions,
by stating the principle of res-judicata is not applicable,              Mr.
Kaushik has relied upon following judgments for the proposition, which I
reproduce in a tabular form:

74.    I have considered the above judgments relied upon by                 Mr.
75.    In so far as his plea that Section 11 petition is not made to the
‘Court’ by relying upon the judgment of the Supreme Court in the case of
Rodemadan India Limited (supra) is concerned, the same is a misplaced
argument. It is true that a petition under Section 11(6) shall lie before the
High Court or the Supreme Court and are not “Court” within the meaning
of Section 2(1)(e) but the exercise of the power under Section 11 (6) by
the High Court or Supreme Court is a judicial function (Ref: SBP and Co.
76.    So it follows, the High Court while exercising judicial function
under Section 11(6) can determine the issue of maintainability of a petition
on any ground including on territorial jurisdiction / res judicata etc., and
the same is clear from the judgment of Anil, S/o Jagannath Rana & Ors.
(supra), that the principle of res judicata shall be applicable to a petition
under Section 11. Otherwise, it would mean, despite a petition under
Section 11 (6) not maintainable, like, on the ground that the High Court
lacks the territorial jurisdiction as the seat of arbitration is elsewhere; the
petition needs to be entertained. Such cannot be the position in law. This
Court can, if a petition is not maintainable, shall be within its right to
dismiss the petition at the threshold.
77.    The plea of Mr. Kaushik that, while appointing an Arbitrator, there
is no decision on merits and as such, res-judicata shall not be applicable,
is also without merit, inasmuch as the proceedings in Antique Art Export
(supra), arose from a petition under Section 11 of the Act filed before this
Court. The Supreme Court by a detailed judgment by holding that no
arbitrable dispute subsists between the parties, has set aside the order of
ARB.P. 163/2022 & ARB.P. 164/2022                                  Page 32 of 38
this Court appointing the Arbitrator. Such a finding is binding between
the parties and any subsequent litigation shall be barred by principle of res
judicata.    Accordingly, these petitions need to be dismissed at the
78.     Similarly, the plea of Mr. Kaushik that, Section 42 is not attracted
to a petition under Section 11 of the Act as High Court is not a ‘Court’
within the meaning of Section 2(1)(e) of the Act is concerned, no doubt
the High Court while exercising power under Section 11(6) of the Act is
not a ‘Court’ as defined under Section 2(1)(e) of the Act and Section 42
is not attracted, but for the reason already stated above, this Court while
exercising its jurisdiction under Section 11 can look into the issue of
maintainability of an application before this court on any ground including
on the principle of res judicata.
79.    In so far as the judgments relied upon by Mr. Kaushik on the
proposition (1) res judicata shall not be applicable to an erroneous
decision; (2) the case decided without argument, without reference to the
crucial words of Rule and without any citation or authority is not binding
to be followed; (3) whenever a previous decision is overruled by a larger
bench, the previous decision is completely wiped out and Article 141 will
have no application to the decision which has already been overruled and
the Court has to decide the case according to law laid down by the latest
decisio0n; (4) if a subsequent decision alters the earlier one, it does not
make new law, it only discovers the principle of correct principle law
which has to be applied retrospectively; (5) it is settled law that an order
passed by a Court without jurisdiction is a nullity; (6) a jurisdictional
question if wrongly decided, would not attract the principle of res judicata
are concerned, the same are misplaced in the facts of this case and cannot
ARB.P. 163/2022 & ARB.P. 164/2022                               Page 33 of 38
80.    There is no contest to the fact that the petitioner itself had filed
earlier petitions before this Court for appointment of arbitrator. The Court
was competent to decide the same, and infact appointed an Arbitrator. The
appeals were filed under Article 136 of the Constitution of India and as
such were maintainable before the Supreme Court.
81.    The Supreme Court passed a detailed Judgment on March 28, 2019.
The Supreme Court in the said Judgment considered the provisions of
11(6)(A) of the Act of 1996, and held that the dispute raised are not
arbitrable and as such set aside the judgment of this Court appointing the
learned Arbitrator. It is on an interpretation of Section 11 (6)(A), the
Supreme Court in M/s. Mayavati Trading Co. (supra) had overruled the
judgment in Antique Art Export (supra), by holding that Section 11(6)(A)
of the Act is confined to the examination of the existence of an arbitration
agreement as the issue of accord and satisfaction has been overruled
legislatively. Suffice to state, the overruling of the Judgment was on the
ground that, Antique Art Export (supra) does not lay down the correct
law. The Supreme Court while overruling Antique Art Export (supra)
has laid down the correct law. It was not the conclusion of the Court that
the Judgment in Antique Art Export (supra) is a nullity. Not being a
nullity, the Judgment in the case of Antique Art Export (supra) is binding
between the parties herein.
82.    I may state here, the judgment of M/s. Mayavati Trading Co.
(supra) had also been considered by the Supreme Court, in its subsequent
judgments more specifically in Bharat Sanchar Nigam Ltd. & Anr. v.
(supra) and Indian Oil Corpn. Ltd. v. NCC Ltd., (2023) 2 SCC 539. In
ARB.P. 163/2022 & ARB.P. 164/2022                               Page 34 of 38
Bharat Sanchar Nigam Ltd. & Anr. (supra), the Supreme Court has held
“36. In a recent judgment delivered by a three-judge bench
in Vidya Drolia v. Durga Trading Corporation, on the
scope of power under Sections 8 and 11, it has been held
that the Court must undertake a primary first review to
weed out “manifestly ex facie non-existent and invalid
arbitration agreements, or non-arbitrable disputes.” The
prima facie review at the reference stage is to cut the
deadwood, where dismissal is bare faced and pellucid, and
when on the facts and law, the litigation must stop at the
first stage. Only when the Court is certain that no valid
arbitration agreement exists, or that the subject matter is
not arbitrable, that reference may be refused.
While exercising jurisdiction under Section 11 as the
judicial forum, the court may exercise the prima facie test
to screen and knockdown ex facie meritless, frivolous, and
dishonest litigation. Limited jurisdiction of the courts
would ensure expeditious and efficient disposal at the
referral stage. At the referral stage, the Court can interfere
“only” when it is “manifest” that the claims are ex facie
time-barred and dead, or there is no subsisting dispute.
Para 148 of the judgment read as follows: (Vidya Drolia
case [Vidya Drolia v. Durga Trading Corpn., (2021) 2 SCC
1: (2021) 1 SCC (Civ) 549], SCC p. 119)
83.   In Vidya Drolia (supra), the Supreme Court has held as under:-
“146. We now proceed to examine the question, whether
the word “existence” in Section 11 merely refers to
contract formation (whether there is an arbitration
agreement) and excludes the question of enforcement
(validity) and therefore the latter falls outside the
jurisdiction of the court at the referral stage. On
jurisprudentially and textualism it is possible to
differentiate between existence of an arbitration
agreement and validity of an arbitration agreement. Such
ARB.P. 163/2022 & ARB.P. 164/2022                              Page 35 of 38
interpretation can draw support from the plain meaning of
the word “existence”. However, it is equally possible,
jurisprudentially and on contextualism, to hold that an
agreement has no existence if it is not enforceable and not
binding. Existence of an arbitration agreement
presupposes a valid agreement which would be enforced
by the court by relegating the parties to arbitration.
Legalistic and plain meaning interpretation would be
contrary to the contextual background including the
definition clause and would result in unpalatable
consequences. A reasonable and just interpretation of
“existence” requires understanding the context, the
purpose and the relevant legal norms applicable for a
binding and enforceable arbitration agreement. An
agreement evidenced in writing has no meaning unless the
parties can be compelled to adhere and abide by the terms.
A party cannot sue and claim rights based on an
unenforceable document. Thus, there are good reasons to
hold that an arbitration agreement exists only when it is
valid and legal. A void and unenforceable understanding
is no agreement to do anything. Existence of an arbitration
agreement means an arbitration agreement that meets and
satisfies the statutory requirements of both the Arbitration
Act and the Contract Act and when it is enforceable in
law.”
154. Discussion under the heading “Who Decides
Arbitrability?” can be crystallised as under:
154.4. Rarely as a demurrer the court may interfere at
Section 8 or 11 stage when it is manifestly and ex facie
certain that the arbitration agreement is non-existent,
invalid or the disputes are non-arbitrable, though the
nature and facet of non-arbitrability would, to some
extent, determine the level and nature of judicial scrutiny.
The restricted and limited review is to check and protect
parties from being forced to arbitrate when the matter is
demonstrably “non-arbitrable” and to cut off the
deadwood. The court by default would refer the matter
when contentions relating to non-arbitrability are plainly
arguable; when consideration in summary proceedings
ARB.P. 163/2022 & ARB.P. 164/2022                              Page 36 of 38
would be insufficient and inconclusive; when facts are
contested; when the party opposing arbitration adopts
delaying tactics or impairs conduct of arbitration
proceedings. This is not the stage for the court to enter into
a mini trial or elaborate review so as to usurp the
jurisdiction of the Arbitral Tribunal but to affirm and
uphold integrity and efficacy of arbitration as an
alternative dispute resolution mechanism.”
84.    In Indian Oil Corpn. Ltd.(supra), the Supreme Court held as
“73. In the recent decision of this Court in DLF Home
Developers Ltd. v. Rajapura Homes (P) Ltd. in which this
Court also had an occasion to consider Section 11(6-A) of
the Arbitration Act and ultimately has observed, after
referring to and considering the decision of the three-Judge
Bench of this Court in Vidya Drolia that the jurisdiction of
the Court under Section 11 of the Arbitration Act is primarily
to find out whether there existed a written agreement
between the parties for resolution of the dispute and whether
the aggrieved party has made out a prima facie arguable
case, it is further observed that limited jurisdiction, however,
does not denude the Court of its judicial function to look
beyond the bare existence of an arbitration clause to cut the
deadwood. In the said decision, this Court had taken note of
the observations made in Vidya Drolia that with a view to
prevent wastage of public and private resources, the Court
may conduct “prima facie review” at the stage of reference
to weed out any frivolous or vexatious claims.”
85.    The submission of Mr. Kaushik was that the Supreme Court in
Antique Arts Export (supra), should have only considered the existence
of arbitration agreement and should not have gone into accord and
satisfaction, is a misconceived submission. This submission of Mr.
Kaushik cannot be a ground to re-open an issue which has already stood
settled between the parties.

86.    In view of my above discussion in the facts of this case, this Court
is of the view that the present petitions filed by the petitioner are not
maintainable as inter se parties, the issue of appointment of an arbitrator
has attained finality with the orders passed by the Supreme Court in
Antique Art Export (supra) and Antique Art Export            (supra). The
petitions are liable to be dismissed without going into other submissions
and Judgments made and relied upon by Mr. Kaushik. The petitions are
dismissed. No costs.
