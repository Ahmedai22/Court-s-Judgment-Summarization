.      Rule. Rule made returnable forthwith. With the consent
of parties, matter is taken up for final hearing.
2.     By     this      petition,   petitioner challenges       order       dated
21.09.2022 passed by the District Judge – 2, Kopergaon on
application below Exhibit 236 by which his defence has been
struck off. He also challenges the order dated 30.09.2022, by
which application filed for recall of order dated 21.09.2022 has
been rejected.
3.     In the custody battle between petitioner-father and
respondent No. 1-mother, an order came to be passed by the
District Court on 27th August, 2020 granting visitation rights in
favour of the mother on every Wednesday between 11.00 a.m. to
12.00 noon in the Court premises. Later, the order was modified
on 05th August, 2022 granting visitation rights to mother from
11.00 a.m. to 01.00 p.m. on each Sunday at Shri Swami Samarth
4.     The mother moved an application for striking off the
defence of petitioner on account of repeated violation of the order
passed by the Court. The application was allowed on 21.09.2022
and the defence of petitioner was struck off under the provisions
of the Order XXXIX Rule 11 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908.
Petitioner moved an application for recall of that order and for
restoration of his defence, which has been rejected by order dated
30th September, 2022 by the District Court.
5.     Appearing for petitioner, Mr. Kulkarni the learned counsel
would submit that the child is not willing to meet the mother.
This is essentially the reason why order granting visitation
rights could not be complied with on certain dates. He submits
that the matter is required to be referred to a counsellor to gauge
child’s inclination to meet mother, rather than striking off
petitioner’s defence for technical violation of court’s order. He
would submit that child’s wish is paramount and therefore, when
the child himself is not willing to meet the mother, the Court
ought not to have straightway struck off defence without
exploring the possibility of referring the matter to a counsellor.
Mr. Kulkarni would further submit that the order striking off the
defence is of drastic nature and ought not to have been passed by
the Court in the peculiar facts and circumstances of the case. In
support of his contention Mr. Kulkarni would rely upon decision
of this Court in Kavita Krishnamurti Vs. K. N. Krishnamurti
reported in MANU/MH/2331/2014.
6.     Per contra, Mrs. Sangit, the learned counsel appearing for
the respondent No. 1 opposes the petition. She would submit
that there has been repeated violation of the order granting
visitation rights by the petitioner and that therefore, the District
Court has correctly struck off his defence. She would in
particular draw my attention to the observations recorded by the
District Court in its order dated 21.01.2021 regarding behaviour
of the petitioner in the Court. She relies upon para Nos. 2 to 5
and 8 of that order, which reads thus :
“2.     Respondent no. 1 was told at 4.30 p.m. today in
clear terms that he should reach his son at home and ask
his advocate to remain present for argument on Exh.122.
But respondent no. 1 made allegations on the court that
this court never told this to him.              He further made
allegations on the court that the court wants that all the
proceeding should happen behind his back thereby
indicating that till now all the orders came to be passed by
this court behind his back without giving him opportunity of
being heard. When this objectionable statement is pointed
out to respondent no.1 and he is told that this is going to
be recorded, he made arrogant statement that
Þeh ;sFksp Fkkacrks vkf.k c?kqu ?ksrksß (When this statement was
recorded, respondent no.1 again created hindrance by
stating that he never addressed to court                Þc?kqu ?ksrksß
thereby making allegations against court that this court is
falsely recording those words.          The words    Þc?kqu ?ksrksß   in
such arrogant tone and on such a timing gives a feeling to
the court that respondent no.1 is threating the Court of dire
consequences.
3.      Since this matter is assigned to this court it has come
to notice of this Court that respondent no1 intentionally
indulged into making allegation on the court and the staff.
He filed a false complaint against senior clerk Shri. Aher of
this court in the part just because he did not write the
roznama to suit the respondent no.1.
4.      This court also noticed that respondent no.1 abuses
petitioner in court by using unparliamentary language. On
one occasion in front of his father, who is respondent no. 3
in this petition, respondent no. 1 used the words
Þx/kGh o c;rkGß for the petitioner in open Court.           The word
Gadhali means donkey and the word Baytai means mad.
(At this pint of time respondent no.1 again interrupted this
court and said that he never uttered the word                Þc;rkGß
for the petitioner, thereby again making allegations on the
court that this court is creating a wrong record). After this
the respondent no.1 submitted that when petitioner made
allegations against him that he is responsible for her 6
abortions, at that time, he uttered the word                   Þx/kGhß
for petitioner. By making this submission respondent no. 1
admitted in open court that he used the said word for
petition. The father of respondent no.1 intervened on the
said occasion and asked respondent no.1 not to use
unparliamentary language in court.          A record of those
words was not prepared by this court at that time just
because the respondent no.1 is a practicing advocate and
this court did not want the career of respondent no1 would
suffer.
5.      It is observed by this Curt that every small thing
respondent no1 prepares videos of his son to create a
record to prove that by passing of order of visitation rights
in favour of petitioner this court has committed a blunder.
8.      As per visitation rights order clear directions were
given to respondent no.1 not to remain present near his
son or in such area where he could be visible to his son so
that his son does not get intimated while meeting the
petitioner. But on every date of visitation right he is
disobeying the said order willfully by keeping his son next
to him during the visitation is going on. Whenever his son
tries to go near the petitioner he calls him back. He does
not allow the petitioner to take her son close to her. On
one occasion when the petitioner took her son on the
second floor of the building to interact with him, the
respondent no.1 created a scene. The petitioner brought
her son safely in the court hall after about half an hour.
But the respondent no.1 made an issue that his son
suffered head injury as petitioner took him on the second
floor. When his son was taken close by me and I personally
verified about any injury to his son, I did not find any injury
or even pain to his son. After the court was over the
respondent no.1 went to his chamber and made a video of
his son wherein his son was crying and saying that he
suffered injury on his head. This shows that things which
never happened are projected by respondent no.1 in such a
way so as to suit his purpose and can be used against
petitioner.”
7.     Mrs. Sangeet would further submit that there has been
intentional disobedience of the order on the part of the petitioner.
Even after passing of the order dated 30.09.2022, the petitioner
has not granted any visitation rights to the respondent No. 1 till
date.
8.     After having heard learned counsel for the parties, it is
clear that non-grant of visitation rights by the petitioner to the
respondent No. 1 is not under dispute. What the petitioner
essentially contends is that the disobedience of the order is not
intentional. The pretext of disinclination of child to meet mother
has been presented for non-following the order passed by the
Court.     It is apparent that on 21.09.2022, when the District
Court proceeded to strike off the defence of the petitioner, there
were as many as eleven violations of the visitation rights on the
part of the petitioner.    During the period from 07.08.2022 to
04.09.2022, as well the petitioner seems to have obstructed the
child during his visit with mother on 25.09.2022 and indulged in
the act of video shooting the incidence. The Court has observed
that on 25.09.2022, the petitioner created obstacle in the
visitation right by going close to the child.
9.     So far as the contention of Mr. Kulkarni that the matter is
required to be referred to a counsellor, it appears that such an
attempt was earlier made by the petitioner and by order passed
on 21.09.2022, petitioner’s request for referring the matter to the
counsellor was set aside. It must be borne in mind that present
petition does not challenge the order granting visitation rights.
Therefore, the question of revisiting that order by referring the
matter to the counsellor for verifying the inclination of the child
to visit his mother does not arise.
10.    The situation that emerges before me is that the order
granting visitation rights passed on 27.08.2020 as modified by
the Court on 05.08.2022 has attained finality. Petitioner’s
request for verifying the disinclination of the child to meet
mother by referring the matter to a counsel has also been
rejected by order dated 21.09.2022. That order has also attained
finality. In such a situation, it was not open for the petitioner to
deny visitation rights to the mother on the pretext of
disinclination of the child to meet the mother.
11.    True it is that the order striking off defence is drastic one
which should be avoided by the Courts. In normal circumstances,
the Court would have recourse to such a drastic order only after
it arrives at finding that there is something more than mere
violation and that there is a willful breach of the order.
12.    In its order, the District Court has recorded specific finding
that the petitioner has intentionally committed breach of the
interim order and that there is intentional disobedience on the
part of the petitioner. Para 10 of the order passed by the District
“10. So far as, the present proceeding is concerned, the
record does speak of volumes. On apparent perusal of
some documents on record, the very conduct of non-
applicant no.1 in disobeying the interim order of visitation
is very much glaring and evident. This Court observes
that, there are applications at Exh. Nos.66, 82, 143, 175,
176, 180, 183, 201, 208, 210 and Exh. 212. ON apparent
perusal of these applications, it may be noted that, non-
applicant no. 1 has not allowed the applicant to meet son
Reyansh in past also. To this, there is no categorical
account or explanation coming-forth on behalf of non-
applicant no.1.    Apart from the aforesaid voluminous
documents, which shows intentional disobedience of
interim order of this Court by non-applicant no.1, the very
observations recorded by my Ld. Predecessor equally
speaks of volumes and throw light on attitude of non-
applicant no.1 in flouting the interim order of this Court as
to visitation. In this premise, the order of this Court dated
21/01/2021 below Exhibit.1, particularly across paragraph
nos. 8 and 9 are self-speaking. It is categorically observed
by the Ld. Predecessor of this Court as below-
But on every date of visitation right he is
disobeying the said order willfully by keeping his
son next to him during the visitation is going on.
Whenever his son tries to go near the petitioner he
calls him back. He does not allow the petitioner to
take her son close to her. On one occasion when
the petitioner took her son on the second floor of
the building to interact with him, the respondent
no.1 created a scene. The petitioner brought her
son safely in the court hall after about half an
hour.
13.    Thus, the issue as to whether there is an intentional
violation on the part of the petitioner has already been gone into
by the District Court and a finding of fact is recorded that the
petitioner has intentionally committed disobedience of the order.
14.    Reliance of Mr. Kulkarni on the judgment of this Court in
Kavita Krishnamurti (supra) would be of little assistance to the
petitioner as this Court has observed in that case that no specific
finding of willful disobedience was recorded by the Family Court
while passing the order of striking off defence. As against this, in
the present case a specific finding has been recorded by the
District Court to the effect that the petitioner has committed
intentional disobedience of the interim orders passed by the
15.    Also of relevance is the fact that after passing order dated
21.09.2022 striking off the defence as well as after passing of the
order dated 30.09.2022 rejecting application for recalling of that
order, Petitioner has once again defaulted on grant of visitation
rights in favour of the mother. In these circumstances, I do not
feel that any error is committed by the District Court in passing
the impugned orders.
16.    The child today is eight years old and the mother has been
granted visitation rights for only two hours in a week. During
custody battle pending for 3 years, the child has grown from 5
years to 8 years. It is really unfortunate that father is creating
hurdles and preventing the mother from meeting the child.
Petitioner’s conduct in Court as reflected in the order dated
21.01.2022 extracted hereinabove also speaks volumes about lack
of bonafides. Petitioner appears to be attempting to frustrate the
order granting visitation rights in a indirect manner.
17.    After the judgment was dictated in open court, Mr.
Kulkarni, learned counsel for the petitioner has tendered across
the bar an undertaking of the petitioner dated 17.10.2022 to
follow and abide by the orders passed by the District Court
regarding visitation rights. Said undertaking is taken on record.
In my opinion, Petitioner ought to have shown remorse before
the District Court in respect of his conduct and improved upon
his behaviour atleast after his defence was struck off. Far from
doing so, he sought to justify his conduct on the pretext of
disinclination of child to meet the mother. However, his
incalcitrant attitude has continued even after passing of
impugned orders. The contention of child’s disinclination to meet
mother and plea for referring the child to counsellor were
strenuously pressed before me. It is only after the judgment is
dictated that the undertaking is tendered. Counsel appearing for
the Respondent has opposed modification of the present
judgment by taking into consideration Petitioner’s undertaking.
In such circumstances, tendering of such undertaking at a
belated stage is inconsequential. Petitioner is otherwise bound by
the orders passed by the District Court even after his defence has
been struck off.
18.             Petition is devoid of merits. It is dismissed without
any orders as to costs. Rule is discharged.
