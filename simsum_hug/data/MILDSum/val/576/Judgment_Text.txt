1.            By this appeal, the appellant challenges judgment and
order dated 20.7.2017 passed by learned Additional Sessions Judge,
Chandrapur in Sessions Case No.111/2015 whereby he is convicted

2.           Heard learned counsel Shri S.G.Joshi appointed for the
appellant and learned Additional Public Prosecutor Shri M.J.Khan for
3.           The case of the prosecution in a nutshell is as under:
The crime is registered on the basis of report lodged by
one Sunil Shendre on 4.9.2015 on allegations that deceased Chhaya
was residing along with her husband i.e. the appellant (for short,
“the accused”) and daughter Kajal in his neighbourhood. He is
residing along with his family at Nanded, taluka Nagbhid, district
Chandrapur. The accused is in a habit of drinking liquor and used to
beat his wife on trifle reasons.   On 3.9.2015, when the informant
was sleeping in his house, he heard the accused abusing his wife
and, therefore, he came out of his house. It is alleged that he saw
that the accused was quarreling with his wife started assaulting her
by kick and fist blows on the count that she had not cooked meat
properly and she burnt it.      It is further alleged that when the
informant went there, the accused threatened him that if he
intervenes in the quarrel, he will kill him.  Due to the threat, the
informant left along with accused’s daughter Kajal. At about 11:30
p.m., he saw that the wife of the accused is lying dead in the shed
and, therefore, he approached police and lodged the report.
4.           On the basis of the report lodged by the informant,
Nagbhid Police Station, District Chandrapur registered the offence
vide Crime No.101/2015 under Section 302 of the Indian Penal
Code.    After registration of the crime, wheels of investigation
started rotating. During investigation, Investigating Officer visited
the alleged spot of the incident and seized incriminating articles,
pieces of bangles, and a stick by drawing spot panchnama.           The
Investigating Officer also drawn inquest panchnama, seized clothes
of deceased, clothes of accused, and samples of deceased and
accused, collected postmortem notes and after completion of the
investigation, submitted chargesheet against the accused in the
Court of law.
5.           Learned Magistrate committed the case to the Court of
Sessions. The charge was framed against the accused vide Exhibit-
3. The accused pleaded not guilty and claimed to be tried.
6.           To substantiate the charge levelled against the accused,
the prosecution examined as many as 11 witnesses, as mentioned
15), pancha on spot;
pancha on clothes’ seizure panchanama ;
(4) Kajal Suresh Shendre (PW4) (Exhibit-37), the
daughter of the accused and the deceased;
Assistant Police Inspector, and
7.          Besides the evidence, the prosecution relied upon
various documents including spot panchnama Exhibit-19, inquest
panchnama Exhibit-21, clothes’ seizure panchnamas Exhibits-24
and 25, seizure memo Exhibit-26, oral report Exhibit-28, printed
First  Information   Report  Exhibit-29,    and  Chemical    Analyzer’s
8.           The defence of the accused is of total denial.     As per
defence of the accused, the deceased was suffering from “Epilepsy”
and on the day of incident she had stroke of Epilepsy and fallen on
the ground and sustained injuries.
9.           Learned   counsel   Shri   S.G.Joshi  for  the   appellant
submitted that     to prove the homicidal death the prosecution
Shivankar. Though the Medical Officer has denied the possibility of
sustaining injuries due to the fall due to stroke by Epilepsy, the oral
evidence shows that the deceased was suffering from Epilepsy and
and on the day of the incident also due to Stroke of Epilepsy she
fallen on the ground and sustained injuries. He further submitted
that the oral evidence of witnesses PW3 informant Sunil Suresh
Shendre and PW4 accused’s and deceased’s daughter Kajal Suresh
Shendre who acquainted with the deceased specifically stated that
the deceased had sustained injuries due to the fall.         Thus, the
prosecution has not proved the homicidal death of the deceased.
He further submitted that the prosecution relied on the evidence of
PW3    informant    Sunil  Suresh    Shendre;   PW4    accused’s    and
deceased’s    daughter    Kajal   Suresh   Shendre;   PW5   accused’s
neighbour Tarabai Suresh Shendre, and PW6 accused’s neighbour
Indubai Suresh Raut who had not supported the prosecution case.
Thus, the prosecution failed to prove the charges levelled against
the  accused.      Alternatively,  he  submitted   that  even   if  the
prosecution case is taken as it is, there was no intention on the part
of the accused to commit the murder of the deceased, whatever
happened is in a spur of moment as the accused lost his self control
as the deceased had not cooked the food properly. The accused has
not acted brutally. The injuries sustained by the deceased were not
on the vital parts. The exception 4 under Section 300 of the Indian
Penal Code is available to the accused.      In a sudden fight and a
sudden quarrel, the accused had given the blow by stick and the
deceased succumbed to death.          He further submitted that the
prosecution relied on the evidence of PW3 informant Sunil Suresh
Shendre; PW4 accused’s and deceased’s daughter Kajal Suresh
Shendre; PW5 accused’s neighbour Tarabai Suresh Shendre, and
PW6 accused’s neighbour Indubai Suresh Raut who had not
supported the prosecution case.       Thus, the prosecution failed to
prove the charges levelled against the accused. He submitted that
the accused be acquitted from the charge and alternatively he
prayed for the lesser punishment in view of the exception sudden
fight and sudden quarrel.
10.          On the other hand, learned Additional Public Prosecutor
Shri M.J.Khan for the State submitted that the deceased is the wife
of the accused.      The accused had committed her murder by
assaulting her repeatedly and due to the repeated blows the
deceased had sustained in all six injuries as well as internal injuries
which resulted into her death. There was instantaneous death of the
deceased. Though PW3, PW4, PW5, and PW6 had not supported the
prosecution case, circumstantial evidence on record is sufficient to
show that the accused is the perpetrator of the crime. The defence
of a sudden fight and a sudden quarrel is not available to the
accused as the quarrel was only from one side.             Hence, no
interference is called for in the judgment and order impugned in the
11.          As regards the homicidal death of the deceased namely
Chhaya is concerned, the material evidence adduced by the
prosecution is the testimony of PW7 Medical Officer Dr.Sanjaykumar
Diwakarrao Shivankar who conducted the postmortem examination
on Chhaya and PW1 Vilas Bhajandas Mungmode who acted as
pancha on the inquest panchnama.        The testimony of PW1 Vilas
shows that he was called by the police in the hospital and in his
presence the panchnama regarding the dead body was conducted.
He witnessed that there was injury on the lower lip as well as on the
lower abdomen portion over the left thigh.         Accordingly, inquest
panchanama (Exhibit-21) was drawn. Though PW1 Vilas was cross-
examined at length, nothing incriminating is brought on record to
deny the injuries on the person of the deceased.
12.          The prosecution has placed implicit reliance on the
evidence   of   PW7   Medical    Officer  Dr.Sanjaykumar    Diwakarrao
Shivankar, who has deposed that he performed postmortem on the
dead body on 4.9.2015 and noted the external injuries on the said
dead body in column No.17 of the postmortem report, which are
“(1) swelling of face;
(2) contusion over right infra orbital region 4x3x2
(3) contusion over right maxila of size 3x2x1 cm;
(4) contusion over left maxila of size 3x3x2 cm;
(5) abrasion over left forehead size 3x3 cm;
(6) tenderness over left side of chest; and
(7) swelling over left side of chest.”
The Medical Officer has also noted internal injuries like
fracture over the fourth rib on left side, contusion over the middle
part of left lung, contusion over the left side of heart anteriorly of
size 3x2 cm. There was rupture of pancreas, bleeding was present
and rupture over the splin area of size 3x2 cms.          As per the
evidence of the Medical Officer, all injures were antemortem and
those were possible due to forceful assault by means of hard object
like wooden rod, steel rod, kick and fist blows etc.. The cause of
death was due to “Cardiogenic Shock” due to injury to vital organ.
He further deposed that he also collected the blood samples of the
deceased and forwarded it to the police. When the deceased was
brought to him, her apparels were stained with blood. Accordingly,
he prepared the postmortem notes Exhibit-56.       He also replied to
the query report to the police and opined that the wooden rod
referred to him was of height 2 feet 3 inches with circumference of
6.5 inches and injuries are possible by the said weapon.
13.           The Medical Officer was cross-examined at length by
the defence and tried to suggest that the injuries sustained by the
deceased are possible due to the fall on the hard surface which was
denied by the said Medical Officer.      He further denied that the
deceased had sustained injuries due fall on the ground due to
stroke of Epilepsy.   Thus, the defence of the accused is that the
deceased had sustained injuries due to fall on the ground as she
had a stroke of Epilepsy.       Though the accused had taken the
defence   that  the   deceased    was  suffering  from  Epilepsy,    no
document regarding her treatment is filed on record to support the
14.          After appreciating the evidence of PW7 Medical Officer
Dr.Sanjaykumar Diwakarrao Shivankar and inquest report, it reveals
that the deceased had sustained injuries due to assault on her due
to stick. The Medical Officer had denied the possibility that the said
injuries are possible due to fall. Besides the medical opinion by the
Medical Officer as regards the deceased, the Medical Officer had
opportunity to see injuries while conducting the postmortem over
Chhaya, the deceased.
15.          A  medical    witness,   who   performs  a   postmortem
examination, is a witness of fact though he also gives an opinion on
certain aspects of the case. This proposition of law has been stated
by the Honourable Apex Court in the case of Smt. Nagindra Bala
Mitraand vs. Sunil Chandra Roy and another, reported at 1960 SCR
(3) 1 wherein the Honourable Apex Court observed that “the value
of a medical witness is not merely a check upon the testimony of
eyewitnesses; it is also independent testimony, because it may
establish certain facts, quite apart from the other oral evidence. If a
person is shot, at close range, the marks of tatooing found by the
medical witness would show that the range was small, quite apart
from any other opinion of his. Similarly, fractures of bones, depth
and size of the wounds would show the nature of the weapon used.
It is wrong to say that it is only opinion evidence; it is often direct
evidence of the facts found upon the victim's person .”      Thus, the
testimony of medical witness is very important and it can be safely
accepted.       The    evidence   adduced   by   the  Medical    Officer
corroborated by the inquest panchanama shows that the deceased
died homicidal death.
16.           Sydeny Brandon in his book ‘Violence in Family’ wrote,
"Statistically it is safer to be on streets after dark with a stranger
than at home in the bosom of one's family, for it is there that
accident, murder and violence are likely to occur".
17.           The present case is one more example of such type of
violence in the house. The deceased is the wife of the accused. It
is alleged that the incident had occurred as the deceased had not
prepared meat properly due to which the accused got annoyed and
he gave blow of sticks on her person and she succumbed to death.
18.            The prosecution placed implicit reliance on the
evidence of PW3 informant Sunil Suresh Shendre who is neighbour
as well as relative of the accused. PW3 Sunil had lodged the First
Information Report of the incident. The prosecution also relied upon
evidence of accused’s and deceased’s daughter PW4 Kajal Suresh
Shendre. Both these witnesses have not supported the prosecution
case. PW4 Kajal has totally left the loyalty towards the prosecution.
PW3 informant Suresh Shendre had supported the prosecution case
to some extent. He deposed that on the day of the incident, when
he was at home, he heard the quarrel between the accused and his
wife as the deceased cooked the meat of pig and burnt it.          The
daughter of the accused came to his house and informed him about
the quarrel and, therefore, he went to the house of the accused. He
brought Kajal to his house.    He also lodged the report about the
said incident which is at Exhibit-28 and printed First Information
Report is at Exhibit-29.     During his cross-examination by the
defence, he admitted that there used to be verbal spats between
the accused and his wife, otherwise they were behaving nicely with
each other. He also admitted that the deceased was suffering from
Epilepsy and she used to fall on the ground due to stroke of
Epilepsy. He also admitted that on the day of the incident also she
suffered injuries due to stroke of Epilepsy. Thus, the defence has
tried to prove the defence that the deceased had sustained injuries
due to fall.
19.          As observed earlier, accused’s and deceased’s daughter
PW4 Kajal has completely left the loyalty towards the prosecution.
The    evidence    of   accused’s   neighbour    PW5   Tarabai   Suresh
Shendrealso also shows that she left the loyalty towards the
prosecution   and     initially not  supported    the  version   of   the
prosecution, but during cross-examination by learned APP before
the Trial Court she admitted that Kajal informed her that there was
quarrel between the accused and the deceased. The accused who is
her father had beaten her mother and, therefore, she died. Again
during the cross-examination by the defence, this witness admitted
that no such disclosure was made to her by Kajal.
20.          PW6 Indubai Suresh Raut is also residing in the
neighbourhood of the deceased and the accused.              During her
testimony, initially, she had left the loyalty towards the prosecution,
but during cross-examination by learned APP before the Trial Court
she admitted that the accused is in a habit of consuming liquor. The
accused is hot tempered and quarrelsome nature. He had quarreled
with her, her brother, and neighbour Tarabai and also beaten her.
She further admitted that the accused used to beat his wife Chhaya
under the influence of liquor. She further admitted that due to the
nature of the accused she as well as other people residing in that
locality were afraid of him.     She further admitted during cross-
examination by learned APP before the Trial Court that she and her
husband witnessed that the accused was abusing and beating his
wife Chhaya on account of burning of meat cury. She assigned the
reason that as she was afraid of the accused, she did not visit the
house of the accused. It further came in her cross-examination that
on the next day she saw Chhaya, the deceased, lying on the floor
facing towards sky on the mat in a dead condition.         She also
witnessed the injuries over the lips and stomach.       She further
testified that when Tarabai (PW5) enquired with Kajal, the daughter
of the accused and the deceased, Kajal disclosed that her father had
abused and beaten her mother with kick and fist blows on account
of burning of meat cury. Thus, from the evidence of PW6 Indubai it
reveals that though initially she has not supported the prosecution
version, during cross-examination by learned APP before the Trial
Court, she narrated the entire incident.    Learned counsel for the
defence also cross-examined this witness and it is admitted by her
that there were good relationship between the accused and the
deceased. She also admitted that as they were sleeping in night,
they did not hear any sound of quarrel. Thus, though the defence
has cross-examined this witness, the material incident that there
was quarrel in the night of the incident between the deceased and
the accused, was not shattered.
21.           Thus, the prosecution had relied upon these four
witnesses informant PW3 Sunil Suresh Shendre (PW3); accused’s
and deceased’s daughter PW4 Kajal Suresh Shendre; accused’s
neighbour PW5 Tarabai Suresh Shendre, and accused’s neighbour
PW6 Indubai Suresh Raut.      Though these four witnesses have not
completely supported the prosecution case, but entire core of their
evidence established that the accused was in a habit of drinking
liquor and he used to beat the deceased under the influence of
liquor. It further proved by the prosecution that on 3.9.2015 in the
night hours there was quarrel between the deceased and the
accused as the deceased has not prepared meat properly.           It is
further proved that the deceased was abused and assaulted by the
accused. Learned      counsel  Shri  S.G.Joshi   for  the  appellant
vehemently submitted that all these four witnesses have not
supported the prosecution case. Besides their evidence, there is no
other evidence on record to show that it is the accused who is the
perpetrator of the crime.    As already observed that though these
witnesses have not supported entirely, however their evidence
corroborates the prosecution case that at the relevant time of the
incident the deceased was abused and assaulted by the accused and
subsequently she was found dead.
It is well settled that the law on the treatment of a
hostile witness is that the evidence of such a witness need not be
completely rejected only because such witness was turned hostile.
The Court must, however, be circumspect in accepting their
testimony and, to the extent possible, look for its corroboration.
22.          Admittedly, in the present case, there is no direct
evidence in the nature of eyewitness. The entire prosecution case is
rested on circumstantial evidence.     The circumstances on record
show that the deceased is the wife of the accused and at the
relevant time they were residing together.         There was quarrel
between the deceased and the accused on the night of the incident.
The accused was seen with the deceased abusing and assaulting
her. Subsequently, she was found dead for which no explanation is
put forth by the accused. The death of the deceased as homicidal
one is established by the prosecution.
23.          Now, it has to be seen whether the prosecution
succeeded in seeking corroboration to the fact that the death of the
deceased was caused in the house wherein the deceased and the
accused were residing together.       The prosecution adduced the
evidence of pancha on spot PW1 Vilas Bhajandas Mungmode.             He
testified that on the request of the police, his superior deputed him
to act as a pancha. He visited the alleged spot of the incident. In
his presence panchanama regarding the spot of incident was drawn.
The spot of the incident is situated at the house of Suresh Madhukar
Shende i.e the accused. He further observed that there were burnt
utensils containing meat cury.     The prosecution case itself shows
that the alleged incident had occurred as the deceased has not
prepared the meat cury properly. The Investigating Officer has also
collected the house extract of the accused which shows that the
accused and the deceased are owners of the house.         PW8 Ashwin
Bangre and PW9 are photographers who obtained photographs of
the spot of incident.      PW11 is Investigating Officer who also
narrated about the spot of incident.       Thus, the prosecution has
proved that the alleged incident has occurred in the house of the
24.           Another circumstance, on which the prosecution has
relied upon, is Chemical Analyzer’s Reports. The Trial Court has not
marked the Chemical Analyzer’s Reports giving it exhibit numbers.
In view of Section 293 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, the
Chemical Analyzer’s Reports are admissible in evidence being the
reports of the Government Scientific Experts.           The Chemical
Analyzer’s Reports show that the incriminating articles wooden log,
bangle pieces, clothes of the deceased, and clothes of the accused
are sent for its analysis.  As per the Chemical Analyzer’s Reports,
articles saree, nicker, blouse, petticoat of the deceased, and jeans
pant of the accused are stained with human blood. The blood found
on the clothes of the deceased is of Group “A” and the blood group
on the jeans pant of the accused cannot be determined as the
results are inconclusive. The Honourable Apex Court in the case of
Kishor Bhadke vs. State of Maharashtra, reported at 2017 ALL MR
1316 held that the presence of human blood on clothes recovered
at the instance of the accused and mere absence of evidence
regarding blood group cannot be fatal to the prosecution. But, in
the present case, said incriminating circumstance that the blood is
found on the clothes of the accused is not put to the accused during
the statement under Section 313 of the Code of Criminal Procedure
and no opportunity is given to the accused to explain the said
circumstance and, therefore, the said circumstance cannot be taken
into consideration and such evidence is to be ignored.
25.          Admittedly, the present case is rested on circumstantial
evidence. The law is settled regarding the circumstantial evidence
that the circumstances from which an inference of guilt is sought to
be drawn must be cogently and firmly established.                Those
circumstances should be of a definite tendency unerringly pointing
towards the guilt of the accused. The strong circumstances in the
present case against the accused is that the death of the deceased
was caused in the matrimonial house when she was residing with
the accused.    The Honourable Apex Court in the case of Trimukh
Maroti Kirkan v. State of Maharashtra, reported at (2006) ALL MR
(Cri) 3510 held that if an offence takes place inside the privacy of a
house and in such circumstances where the assailants have all the
opportunity to plan and commit the offence at the time and in
circumstances of their choice, it will be extremely difficult for the
prosecution to lead evidence to establish the guilt of the accused if
the strict principle of circumstantial evidence, as noticed above, is
insisted upon by the Courts.       It is further held that where an
accused is alleged to have committed the murder of his wife and the
prosecution succeeds in leading evidence to show that shortly
before the commission of crime they were seen together or the
offence takes placed in the dwelling home where the husband also
normally resided, it has been consistently held that if the accused
does not offer any explanation how the wife received injuries or
offers an explanation which is found to be false, it is a strong
circumstance which indicates that he is responsible for commission
of  the   crime.     Section  106   of  the  Evidence   Act,  in   such
circumstances, comes into play. When the prosecution proves the
chain of circumstances, burden is shifted on the accused to explain
or offer explanation regarding the death of the deceased. The said
Section, lays down Rule that when the accused does not throw any
light upon facts which are especially within his knowledge, and
which could not support any theory or hypothesis compatible with
innocence, the Court can consider his failure to adduce any
explanation, as an additional link which completes the chain.
26.          We have considered submissions and appreciated the
evidence on record on the principles laid down by the Honourable
Apex Court. In that context, the evidence of informant PW3 Sunil
Suresh Shendre, accused’s neighbour PW5 Tarabai Suresh Shendre
and another neighbour PW6 Indubai Suresh Raut is very important.
Their evidence shows that prior to death of the deceased, the
deceased and the accused were seen together.        The accused was
seen abusing and assaulting the deceased. The quarrel was going
on   as  the  deceased    had   not  prepared  the   meat    properly.
Subsequently, the deceased was found dead. The accused has not
offered any explanation. The spot of the incident shows that stick
was lying there which was seized     by the police.   Informant PW1
had witnessed the burnt utensils containing meat cury which
supports the story of the prosecution.    The medical evidence also
shows that the deceased died due to the injuries that is external
and internal sustained by her. The defence of the accused that the
deceased fallen on the ground due to Epilepsy stroke is ruled out by
the Medical Officer and the defence has not produced any document
to show that the deceased was suffering from Epilepsy.              The
subsequent conduct of the accused is also material that he has not
informed the incident to the police or the relatives immediately.
Thus, the entire evidence on record sufficiently shows that the death
of the deceased was caused in the house of the accused due to the
assault by the accused on account of not preparing the food
27.          Learned   counsel    Shri S.G.Joshi   for  the  appellant
submitted that though the case of the prosecution is taken as it is,
there was no intention to kill the deceased.       He submitted that
whatever happened was in a spur of moment. It was a sudden fight
and a sudden quarrel and, therefore, the case of the accused covers
under exception 4 of Section 300 of the Indian Penal Code and,
therefore, the case of the accused covers under the culpable
homicide not amounting to murder.
28.          So far as the intention of the accused is concerned, the
nature   of  intention   has   to   be  gathered   from   surrounding
circumstances like kind of weapon used, the amount of force used,
the part of the body hit and the circumstances attendant upon
death. Admittedly, direct evidence would not be available to gather
the intention as the intention is the inner compartment of that
person’s mind.
29.           Whether    the   case   of the  accused,   covers    under
exception 4 of Section 300 of the Indian Penal Code, a sudden fight
and a sudden quarrel is to be seen from circumstances. Admittedly,
there was quarrel between the accused and the deceased on
account of meat which was not properly cooked and the accused
lost his self control and assaulted the deceased. The exception 4 of
Section 300 of the Indian Penal Code covers acts done in a sudden
fight. The said exception deals with a case of the prosecution not
covered by the first exception, after which its place would have
been more appropriate.       Exception 4 of Section 300 of the Indian
Penal Code deals only if there is heat of passion, the person acts
while losing his self control.    It deals with cases in which a blow
may have been struck or some provocation given in the origin of the
disputes. A sudden fight implies a mutual provocation. The help of
exception 4 of the said Section can be invoked if death is caused,
(a) without premeditation, (b) in a sudden fight, (c) without the
offender having taken undue advantage or acted in a cruel or
unusual manner, and (d) the fight must have been without the
person killed.
30.          Here, in the present case, the facts on record show that
there was a sudden quarrel and there was no premeditation. The
injuries sustained by the deceased were not on the vital parts of her
body.    Admittedly, there were six injuries on the person of the
deceased which were in the nature of contusions and internal
injuries.  The weapon like stick was used.     The evidence nowhere
shows that the accused acted in a cruel manner. The weapon like
stick was used in the assault.
31.          The culpable homicide is defined in Section 299 of the
Indian Penal Code whereas murder is defined in Section 300 of the
Indian Penal Code.      The every act of homicide falls within the
definition of culpable homicide in Section 299 of the Indian Penal
Code.    As per Section 300 of the Indian Penal Code, homicide is
murder. However, there are five exceptions in the said Section and
those exceptions lay down the circumstances in which the act
causing death is not murder even though it may have been done
with the intention or knowledge specified in Section 300 of the
Indian Penal Code. Therefore, it has to be seen whether there was
intention or knowledge with which the act was done and what are
32.          Admittedly, in the present case, the quarrel was taken
place on a simple reason that the deceased had not prepared the
meat properly and the accused lost his self control and gave a blow
of stick on the person of the deceased.     For considering, whether
the case would fall under Section 302 of the Indian Penal Code or
lesser and for finding out nature of intention one has to take into
consideration the kind of weapon used.       Admittedly, the accused
had not prepared for the assault. When he saw that the deceased
had not prepared the food, he abused and assaulted her.            The
weapon used in the present case is a lethal weapon like stick. In
this view of the matter, we find that the appellant had knowledge
that injuries could cause death of the deceased.       There was an
intention on the part of the the accused to cause injuries. However,
the accused had not taken undue advantage or has not acted in a
cruel or unusual manner.     Considering the factual scenario in the
background of the position in law, inevitable conclusion is that the
act of the accused would cover under exception 4 of Section 300 of
the Indian Penal Code and, therefore, the case of the accused would
cover under Section 304 Part-I of the Indian Penal Code.
33.          In view of the discussion above, no case for acquittal is
made out.    However, the case of the appellant would cover under
Section 304 Part-I of the Indian Penal Code and, therefore, the
appeal deserves to be allowed partly and the appellant need not
undergo imprisonment for life and his sentence can be modified by
ordering that he shall undergo rigorous imprisonment for ten years.
Hence, we proceed to pass following order:
(1) The criminal appeal is allowed partly.
(2)   Judgment and order dated 20.7.2017 passed by learned
