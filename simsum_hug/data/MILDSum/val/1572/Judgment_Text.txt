1.        Claimant has preferred the appeal against the judgment of dismissal of
claim application filed under section 92(A) of the MV Act (old) and under
Section 142(2) of the M.V. Act of 1988 in Title Claim Suit No.37/92.
2.        Claimant the widow of the deceased filed the claim case with regard to
the death of Jalal Mian in a motor vehicle accident involving No. B.E.Y-5051
at village Takipur under Dumka district. It is averred the deceased was 55
years of age and had a monthly income of Rs 2000/- from cattle trade at the
time of the accident. The owner, driver and insurer of the offending vehicle
were impleaded as opposite parties.
3.        Both the owner and insurer of the vehicle appeared and contested the
claim inter alia on the ground of non-joinder of necessary parties. It was
pleaded by the owner of the vehicle that it was under the insurance cover of
O.P. No.3 Oriental Insurance Company at the relevant time of accident.
4.        On the basis of the pleading of the parties following issues were
i.  Is the suit maintainable as frame?
ii.  Has applicant got cause of action for the suit?
iii.  Is the suit barred by law of limitation, principle of waiver, estoppel and
acquiescence as bad for non-joinder of necessary parties to the suit?
iv.   Have all legal heirs not joined as parties as to the suit?

of the owner of Truck No.B.E.Y.5051?
viii.   Is petitioner entitled to get compensation under M.V. Act. It yes, what
should be the adequate amount of compensation will be joint for end of
ix.   Is the petitioner is entitle to any other relief or relief?
5.        On Issue No. V the Tribunal recorded a finding that Jalal Mian died in
the motor vehicle accident arising out of use of the Truck bearing registration
no. BEY 5051. It was further held that since the licence of the driver of the
truck was not brought on record by either of the side, therefore it was not
proved that the driver was having a valid driving licence. It was also held that
the vehicle was under the insurance cover O.P. No.3. Learned Tribunal
computed a compensation of Rs.1,85,500 with admissible compensation of
Rs.1,60,500 after deducting Rs.25,000 which was the ad-interim payment to
the claimant.
6.        The claim application was however dismissed on the ground that as per
heirship certificate Ext 2 the other six daughters and one son of the deceased
were not impleaded in the suit. It held that all the heirs were entitled to
compensation in equal proportion except that the claimant was also entitled to
consortium for the death of her husband.
7.        The Judgment of the learned Court below reflects a sad state of affair
where the Tribunal completely misdirected itself and lost sight of the fact that
adjudication in a claim tribunal is in the nature of inquiry and not a trial
where the principles of C.P.C. are not strictly applied. The purpose is to
award just and fair compensation at the earliest to the dependants of the
deceased. Even a civil suit cannot be dismissed for non-joinder, unless the
party is a necessary to the suit. Under Order 1 Rule 9 no suit shall be
defeated by reason of the mis-joinder or non-joinder of parties, and the
Court may in every suit deal with the matter in controversy so far as regards
the rights and interests of the parties actually before it.
Provided that nothing in this rule shall apply to non-joinder of necessary
party.
No suit is to be defeated by reason of mis-joinder or non-joinder of parties.
The prescription extends to appeal as well, and Section 99 provides that no
decree shall be reversed in appeal on account of mis-joinder or non-joinder of
parties or cause of action, unless it is a case of non-joinder of necessary party.
Despite the above position the Court to dismiss suit where a necessary party
has not been joined. Non-joinder of necessary party is fatal when in a suit for
share all the co-sharers are not made parties.
8.        Matter for consideration is whether all the heirs are a necessary party in
a claim case. Compensation is assessed on the basis of dependency and not on
heirship. Only those who are the dependents shall be entitled to
compensation. The entire concept of computation of compensation arising out
of the death is based on calculation of the amount on dependency. In Sarla
Verma v. DTC, (2009) 6 SCC 12 it is held that if the deceased is survived by
parents and siblings, only the mother would be considered to be a dependant.
The learned Tribunal thus committed a gross error to dismiss the claim
application merely on the ground that the all the children of the deceased had
not been impleaded. In any case any of the party or parties could have been
impleaded as dependants and ordered accordingly.
9.        Delay in awarding compensation frustrates the very object of the Act. It
is thirty years down the line when the accident took place and there cannot be
realistic assessment of dependency at this belated stage. Life does not wait for
Court decrees and orders. Daughters would have been married by now and
found their new home and moorings. Exercise into determining the
dependency at this stage would be an exercise in futility. Under the
circumstance, it will be just and fair to award the compensation in favour of
the appellant/claimant only, who will receive the amount for herself and on
behalf of others.
The claimant shall be entitled to compensation as assessed by the
Tribunal in para 12 and 13 of the judgment with interest at the rate of 7.5%
from the date of filing of the claim application.
10.       It has been noted by the Tribunal that none of the parties had brought
on record the driving licence, in this view of matter the owner of the
offending vehicle shall be primarily liable and not the Insurance Company to
the pay compensation amount since no document has been produced by
owner regarding driving licence. It has been held in Pappu v. Vinod Kumar
Lamba, (2018) 3 SCC 208 that the insurance company is entitled to take a
defence that the offending vehicle was driven by an unauthorised person or
the person driving the vehicle did not have a valid driving licence. The onus
would shift on the insurance company only after the owner of the offending
vehicle pleads and proves the basic facts within his knowledge that the driver
of the offending vehicle was authorised by him to drive the vehicle and was
having a valid driving licence at the relevant time.
11.       However, since the matter involves breach of terms and condition of the
insurance policy, therefore the Insurance Company shall pay the
compensation amount as assessed by the Tribunal with interest at the rate of
7.5% to the Tribunal within a month of this order. The Insurance Company
shall be at liberty to recover the amount so paid from the owner of the vehicle
The Tribunal shall disburse the amount to the claimant after proper
identification of the claimant on the basis of relevant documents filed in
support of her identity after due verification.
The appeal is allowed as at above. Consequently, I.A. No. 396 of 2014
stands disposed of.
