3.           Heard finally by consent of the learned Counsel for both
the parties.
4.           Being aggrieved by the judgment passed by Railway
Claims Tribunal, Member (Judicial) and Member (Technical)
Nagpur     Bench,    Nagpur,   in   Claim     Application  No.   OA
(Iiu)/NGP/2011/335 on 23/08/2013 dismissing the claim of the
appellants for Rs.8,00,000/- along with interest form the date of
5.         The original applicant has filed the Claim Application on
account of death of her father namely Shri Suraj Ganvir in an
untoward incident. On 14/04/2011 deceased was travelling from
Gondia to Wadsa by passenger train by purchasing valid railway
ticket for Gondia to Wadsa. As there was heavy rush of the
passengers in the train and the deceased was standing near the
door of the coach, when the train reached in between Hirdamali to
Pindkepar at KM No. 1020/12-13, the deceased fell down from
running train and sustained injuries and died on the spot.
6.         The respondent railway has resisted the claim application
by filing the written statement and stated that it is not untoward
incident and the deceased was not bonafide passenger of the train.
7.         The Tribunal observed that the deceased was not a bona
fide passenger as no ticket was found with him and held that the
claimant had made false claim and railway is not responsible for
the incident. It is also held that the present incident is not covered
within the term “untoward incident”, as defined under Section
123(c)(2) of the Railways Act. Hence, dismissed the claim of the
8.         It is the contention of the appellant that the deceased was
travelling by passenger train from Gondia to Wadsa fell down from
the running train and died on the spot. The learned Tribunal erred
in not considering that railway ticket has been lost in an untoward
incident and specifically contended that the burden lies on railway
to prove that deceased was ticketless passenger. The learned
Counsel for the appellant relied on the following citations :
reported in AIR 2007, SC 1474.
2.         Union of India Vs. Prabhakaran Vijayan Kumar and
others, reported in 2008 ACJ 1895.
3.         Union of India Vs. Rina Devi reported in AIR 2018 SC
9.        It is the contention of the learned Counsel for the
respondent that the deceased was neither a bona fide passenger,
nor fell down from the train in question, the alleged incident took
place due to sole negligent, careless and wrong act on the part of
the deceased, the alleged incident is not covered under Section 123
& 124 of the Railways Act, 1989 and the present appellant-claimant
is not the dependant on the deceased as she is married daughter
therefore the Railway Administration is not liable to pay any
compensation to the appellant.
10.       I   have   perused   the   records  and   considered   the
submissions advanced by the learned Counsel for the respective
parties. The questions for consideration are whether the present
appellant is the ‘dependant’ on the deceased, whether the deceased
was a ‘bonafide passenger’ and whether his death was caused in an
‘untoward incident’.
11.       Admittedly there was no railway ticket found for the
journey from Gondia to Wadsa at the time of preparing of spot
panchanama and during the inquest panchanama.
12.        So far as question whether the present appellant is the
dependant of the deceased is concerned, admittedly she is married.
In view of the judgment Smt. Manjiere Bera (supra), though
claimant is not dependant on deceased, she is entitled for
compensation being legal representative of the deceased. She
cannot be denied compensation on the ground that she is not
dependant on the deceased. Section 123(b) (i) in The Railways Act,
1989 reads as under:
(b) “dependant” means any of the following
relatives of a deceased passenger, namely:—
(i) the wife, husband, son and daughter, and in case
the deceased passenger is unmarried or is a minor,
If Section 123(b)(i) of the Railway Act is perused, it is the
definition of dependant wherein daughter is included. There is no
qualification either married or unmarried daughter. As such
claimant is entitled for compensation. So far as whether deceased
was bonafide passenger or not is concerned, admittedly there was
no railway ticket found on the person of deceased for journey from
Gondia to Wadsa.
13.       The learned Counsel for appellants relied on Rina Devi
(supra), the Hon’ble Supreme Court in paragraph no.17.4 held as
“17.4. We thus hold that the mere presence of a
body on the Railway premises will not be conclusive
to hold that injured or deceased was a bona fide
passenger for which the claim for compensation
could be maintained. However, mere absence of
ticket with such injured or deceased will not
negative the claim that he was a bona fide
passenger. Initial burden will be on the claimant
which can be discharged by filing an affidavit of the
relevant facts and the burden will then shift on the
Railways and the issue can be decided on the facts
shown or the attending circumstances. This will
have to be dealt with from case to case on the basis
of facts found. The legal position in this regard will
stand explained accordingly.”
In view of the judgment Rina Devi (supra), even if there
is no ticket found on the person of deceased that cannot be the
ground for denial of compensation.
14.       Learned Counsel also relied on Union of India Vs.
Mangalaben (supra) wherein this Court relied on the judgment
passed in Rajkumari Vs. Union of India 1993 ACJ 846 held that
"since ticket less travel is an illegal act and exposes
such traveler to penal action, there is presumption
of innocence in favour of the passenger traveling in
train unless contrary is proved by the Railway
Administration that the passenger was, in fact,
ticket less traveler and not a bona fide passenger.
Nothing had prevented the Railway Administration
from checking and detecting any unauthorized
person travelling without a ticket/pass or
permission of Railway Administration."
15.        This Court while deciding First Appeal No.382/2018
(supra) relied on judgment passed in S. Vijayalaxmi by the Madras
High Court wherein it is held that when a person died in an
accident by falling down from train, it is not possible for the legal
heirs to produce the ticket or valid authority to travel in the train.
Next question arise for my determination is that whether the
incident is 'untoward incident' within the meaning of Section
124(A) of the Railway Act.
16.        The Hon’ble Apex Court in this case of Prabhakaran
(Supra) held as under:
10.         We are of the opinion that it will not legally
make any difference whether the deceased was
actually inside the train when she fell down or
whether she was only trying to get into the train when
she fell down. In our opinion in either case it amounts
to an “accidental falling of a passenger from a train
carrying passengers”. Hence, it is an ‘untoward
incident’ as defined in section 123 (c) of the Railways
11. No doubt, it is possible that two interpretations
can be given to the expression ‘accidental falling of a
passenger from a train carrying passengers’, the first
being that it only applies when a person has actually
got inside the train and thereafter falls down from the
train, while the second being that it includes a
situation where a person is trying to do so. Since the
provision for compensation in the Railways Act is a
beneficial piece of legislation, in our opinion, it
should receive a liberal and wilder interpretation and
not a narrow and technical one. Hence, in our
opinion, the latter of the above – mentioned two
interpretations, I.e, the one which advances the object
of the statute and serves its purpose should be
preferred vide Kunal Singh
12. It is well settled that if the words used in a
beneficial or welfare statute are capable of two
constructions, the one which is more in consonance
with the object of the Act and for the benefit of the
person for whom the Act was made should be
preferred. In other words, beneficial or welfare
statutes should be given a liberal and not literal or
strict interpretation.
17.        As held by the Hon’ble Apex Court in Rina Devi (supra)
in para 16.6 which read as under:
“16.6 We are unable to uphold the above view as the
concept of ‘self inflicted injury’ would require intention
to inflict such injury and not mere negligence of any
particular degree. Doing so would amount to invoking
the principle of contributory negligence which cannot be
done in the case of liability based on ‘no fault theory’.
We may in this connection refer to judgment of this
Court in United India Insurance Co. Ltd. v. Sunil Kumar
laying down that plea of negligence of the victim cannot
be allowed in claim based on ‘no fault theory’ under
Section 163A of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988.
Accordingly, we hold that death or injury in the course
of boarding or deboarding a train will be an ‘untoward
incident’ entitling a victim to the compensation and will
not fall under the proviso to Section 124A merely on the
plea of negligence of the victim as a contributing factor.”
18.         As such there cannot be said to be negligence on the part
of deceased when it is strict liability of railway. In view of the fact
that there is no evidence laid by the railway to establish that there
was any negligence on the part of the deceased. The claimant is
legally entitled to claim for compensation. In view of the above
referred judgments, it has to be inferred that deceased was a
bonafide passenger and he fell down from running train was an
untoward incident. As such, I am inclined to allow the first appeal.
Accordingly, I proceed to pass the following order:
i)         The appeal is allowed.
ii)        The impugned judgment dated 23/08/2013
in Claim Application No. OA (IIu)/NGP/2011/335
passed by the Railway Claims Tribunal, Nagpur Bench
is hereby quashed and set aside.
iii)         The respondent/Union of India is directed
to pay to the appellants the sum of Rs.8,00,000/-.
iv)         The said amount shall be deposited in the
account of claimant/appellant after verification of
identity and bank details within three months.
The appeal stands disposed of accordingly.
