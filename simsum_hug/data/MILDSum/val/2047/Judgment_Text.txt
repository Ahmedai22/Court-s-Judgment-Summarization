This Criminal Revision Petition under Section 397 R/w 401
of Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (for short 'Cr.P.C') has
been filed by the defacto complainant challenging the order
dated 16.06.2022 passed by the Additional City Civil & Sessions
Judge, FTSC-III, Bengaluru (for short, the 'Trial Court').
2.    Heard the learned Senior Counsel for the petitioner,
learned counsel for respondent no.1 and the learned High Court
Government Pleader for respondent no.2-State.
3.    Brief facts as revealed from the records that may be
necessary for the purpose of disposal of this revision petition
are, on the complaint of petitioner, a case was registered
against the respondent no.1, who is her husband, in Crime
no.47/2021 by Bommanahalli Police Station, Bengaluru for the
offences punishable under Sections 498(A), 354(A), 354(C),
376(2)(f) of IPC and under Section 4 & 6(N) of the Protection of
Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012 (for short 'POCSO
Act'). The police after investigation had filed a charge sheet
against the respondent no.1 for the aforesaid offences and the
case was numbered as Spl.C.C.No.649/2021 before the Special
Court. In the said case an application was filed by the
CRL.RP No. 919 of 2022
respondent no.1 - accused under Section 227 of Cr.P.C seeking
discharge. The said application was dismissed by the Trial Court
by order dated 14.02.2022. Thereafter, charges were framed
against the respondent no.1 for the aforesaid offences. After
framing of charges, the respondent filed an application under
Section 216 of Cr.P.C, for altering the charges and a prayer
was made to delete the charges framed by the Trial Court for
the offences punishable under Sections 376(2)(f) of IPC and
Section 4 & 6(N) of the POCSO Act. The prosecution had not
seriously opposed the said application before the Trial Court
and the Trial Court by the order impugned dated 16.06.2022
had allowed the said application and being aggrieved by the
same, the defacto complainant who is the mother of victim girl
has approached this Court in this revision petition.
4.  Learned Senior Counsel appearing on behalf of the
petitioner submits that the accused    has no right to maintain
the application under Section 216 of Cr.P.C, He submits that
mere reading of Section 216 of Cr.P.C, would go to show that
the Court has no power to delete any offence from the charge
once the charges are framed against the accused. He submits
that under Section 216 of Cr.P.C the Court can either alter or
CRL.RP No. 919 of 2022
add to the charge which is already framed and there cannot be
any deletion as such. He submits that by allowing application
filed under Section 216 of Cr.P.C, the Trial Court has acquitted
the respondent for the offences punishable under Section
376(2)(f) of IPC and Section 4 & 6(N) of the POCSO Act which
it could not have done having rejected the respondent's
application under Section 227 of Cr.P.C, In support of his
arguments, he has placed reliance on the judgment of the
Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of P.KARTIKALAKSHMI V
SRI GANESH AND ANOTHER - (2017) 3 SCC 347 and the
judgment of this Court in the case of CENTRAL BUREAU OF
INVESTIGATION V passed in CRIMINAL REVISION PETITION
NO.1058/2019      &  CONNECTED     MATTERS     disposed    of  on
5.    Per contra, learned counsel for respondent no.1
submits that while passing orders on the application filed by the
respondent under Section 227 of Cr.P.C, the Trial Court had
clearly observed that there is no material to proceed against
the respondent - accused     for the offences punishable under
Section 376(2)(f) of IPC and Section 4 & 6(N) of the POCSO
Act. By filing an application under Section 216 of Cr.P.C, the
CRL.RP No. 919 of 2022
accused    has prayed to alter the charges accordingly and
considering the same, the Trial Court has allowed the same.
She submits that if any mistake is committed while framing
charge, the Court can always correct the same. She has placed
reliance on the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the
case of ANANT PRAKASH SINHA ALIAS ANANT SINHA V STATE
OF HARYANA AND ANOTHER - (2016) 6 SCC 105 in support of
her arguments and submits that error in framing of charge can
be brought to the notice of the Court by anybody including
accused. Accordingly, she prays to dismiss the petition.
6.    I  have     carefully   considered  the   arguments
addressed on both the sides and also perused the material
available on record.
7.    Undisputed facts of the case are that after the Trial
Court dismissed the application filed by respondent no.1 under
Section 227 of Cr.P.C, charges were framed against him by
Trial Court for all the offences for which he was charge sheeted
which is inclusive of offences punishable under Section of
376(2)(f) of IPC and Section 4 & 6(N) of the POCSO Act.
Though the application under Section 216 of Cr.P.C, was filed
by the respondent with a prayer to alter the charge. Though
CRL.RP No. 919 of 2022
prayer made in the application was to alter the charge, reading
of the averments made in the application would go to show that
virtually a prayer was made for deleting the charges in respect
of offence punishable under Section of 376(2)(f) of IPC and
Section 4 & 6(N) of the POCSO Act on the ground that the Trial
Court while disposing of the application under Section 227 of
Cr.P.C, had made an observation that there are no sufficient
material to proceed against the respondent for the aforesaid
offences. The Trial Court considering the said application and
also appreciating the observation made by it while passing the
orders on the application filed by the respondent under Section
227 of Cr.P.C, had allowed the said application.
8.      The   Hon'ble      Supreme      Court    in  the    case of
P.KARTIKALAKSHMI (supra) at paragraph nos.7 and 8 has
observed as follows:-
"7. We were taken through Sections 221 and 222
CrPC in this context. In the light of the facts involved in
this case, we are only concerned with Section 216 CrPC.
We, therefore, do not propose to examine the implications
of the other provisions to the case on hand. We wish to
confine ourselves to the invocation of Section 216 and rest
with that. In the light of our conclusion that the power of
invocation of Section 216 CrPC is exclusively confined with
the Court as an enabling provision for the purpose of
alteration or addition of any charge at any time before
CRL.RP No. 919 of 2022
pronouncement of the judgment, we make it clear that no
party, neither de facto complainant nor the accused or for
that matter the prosecution has any vested right to seek
any addition or alteration of charge, because it is not
provided under Section 216 CrPC. If such a course to be
adopted by the parties is allowed, then it will be well-nigh
impossible    for  the    criminal   court   to conclude   its
proceedings and the concept of speedy trial will get
jeopardised.
8.     In such circumstances, when the application
preferred by the appellant itself before the trial court was
not maintainable, it was not incumbent upon the trial
court to pass an order under Section 216 CrPC. ….."
9.       In the case of SRI GALII JANARDHAN REDDY
(supra), the co-ordinate bench of this Court while considering
the power of the Trial Court under Section 216 of Cr.P.C, has
observed as follows:-
"12.   …. Under the guise of alteration or addition
of the charge, there should not be any deletion of charge,
it is not permissible.        If at all the charge can be
withdrawn, the Court can do it only after the judgment
that too by exercising the power under Section 224 of
Cr.P.C.    If there   is   no   material,  then  under   such
circumstance, the Court cannot go back to the original
stage of hearing before charge and discharge the accused
that too, after recording the evidence of witnesses.
Discharge or deletion gives a liberty to the accused and he
will be set at liberty in a criminal case only at the time of
hearing before charge or subsequently after the trial is
concluded.     In the instant case, under the guise of
CRL.RP No. 919 of 2022
alteration and addition of the charge the Court has
actually discharge the accused for the alleged offence."
10.     On perusal of aforesaid judgments and also after
plain reading of Section 216 of Cr.P.C, I am of the considered
view that the power of the Trial Court under Section 216 of
Cr.P.C, is limited only to alter the charge or add to the charge
which is already framed and in the guise of exercising its power
under Section 216 of Cr.P.C, the Trial Court cannot delete a
charge which has been already framed by it, such a power is
not conferred on it under Section 216 of Cr.P.C,. If a charge is
framed by the Trial Court for an offence which is not made out
by the prosecution by producing sufficient material during the
course of the trial, the Court can always acquit the accused for
the said offence or the Court can punish the accused for lesser
offences but after framing of charge before pronouncement of
final judgment, the Court has no power to delete any charge
which is framed by it.
11.     The judgments on which reliance is placed by the
learned counsel for respondent no.1 is of no assistance to her
case and in the said judgment, the Hon'ble Supreme Court has
not dealt with question of maintainability of the application by
CRL.RP No. 919 of 2022
the accused under Section 216 of Cr.P.C. In the said case, the
application for framing an additional charge was filed by the
informant and the Hon'ble Supreme Court considering the same
has held that if the material on record would go to show that
framing of additional charges is necessary it is always open for
any party to bring the same to the notice of the Court though
primary duty is cast on the Court suomotu to exercise such
power. The said judgment therefore cannot be made applicable
to the facts and circumstances of the present case, wherein the
application has been filed by the respondent - accused under
Section 216 of Cr.P.C, virtually seeking deletion of certain
offences for which he has been charged by the Trial Court.
12.   Merely for the reason that the Trial Court while
passing an order on the application filed by the respondent
under Section 227 of Cr.P.C had made an observation that
there was no sufficient material to proceed against the accused
persons for certain offences, the Trial Court in exercise of its
powers under Section 216 of Cr.P.C cannot delete the charges
framed by it for the said offences as the criminal procedure
code does not confer such a power on the Court. Under the
circumstances, I am of the considered view that the Trial Court
CRL.RP No. 919 of 2022
has erred in allowing the application filed by the accused under
Section 216 of Cr.P.C., which was not at all maintainable in
view of law laid down by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case
of P.KARTIKALAKSHMI (supra). Under the circumstances, the
impugned     order  cannot   be      sustained.  Accordingly,  the
Criminal Revision Petition is allowed.
The order dated 16.06.2022 passed by the
Bengaluru on application filed by the respondent -
accused under Section 216 of Cr.P.C., is set aside
and if the Trial Court has proceeded further and
altered the charges pursuant to the orders passed
by it on application filed by the accused under
Section 216 of Cr.P.C., even the same stands set-
aside.
